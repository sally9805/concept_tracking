The opening sentence of this eighth and final volume of the official biography of Winston Churchill finds him sleeping late on the morning after the surrender of Germany . He was 70 . Within two months the British people would throw him out of office ; but any fear that the rest of his life will be an anti-climax is at once dispelled . He awoke that day to news of the capture of Rangoon , " the splendid close of the Burma campaign , " he telegraphed to Mountbatten ; the struggle against Japan must continue . He lunched in bed , his most favored desk . To Truman he telegraphed that it was his intention " to adhere to our interpretation of the Yalta Agreements . " Tito 's forces had already marched into the Italian province of Venezia Giulia , one of the territories at issue at Yalta , and entered the Austrian province of Carpathia . Communism , established by force of arms in Eastern Europe , was trying to push to the West . On that first day of " peace " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attacked the allied forces in Venezia Giulia , the British commander " has already the fullest authority to reply . " ( Eleven days later , under Churchill 's pressure , Tito 's forces withdrew . ) But the most ominous news was that 15 Polish leaders , all approved by Britain as possible members of a provisional Polish government , had been seized by the Soviet authorities and taken to Moscow as prisoners . In the hour of victory , the cold war was begun ... by the Soviet Union . There , at its very beginning , is the frame of this volume , and the justification of its length . Some have criticized the method of Martin Gilbert 's work . It is true that Gilbert has not provided an interpretative biography , nor drawn on the multitude of other sources that are available ; he has left that more congenial task to later historians . But I think that Gilbert has been , in his way , correct . He has stuck to the thankless task of furnishing a documentary record , overwhelmingly from Churchill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life , decisions , actions , concerns , and style of a statesman who was at the center of affairs from his election to Parliament in 1900 almost until his death . The modesty of Gilbert 's method is appropriate to the magnitude of his subject . Churchill 's activity was so unceasing , his interests so far-ranging , his knowledge of men and affairs so comprehensive , his understanding so profound , his political sense so realistic and so visionary , his influence so large and beneficent and needed , his humanity so various , that it was first necessary that a conscientious historian should labor in the vineyards to give some structure to this life as it was lived . This Gilbert has splendidly done . Perhaps the attention span of some reviewers has been shriveled by television . Personally I would reduce the new volume by only a dozen pages or so ( there are sometimes too copious extracts from the less important speeches ) . Otherwise there is good advice to the reader in the title : never despair . In these pages we contemplate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1953 , when Churchill was 77 , and again prime minister , he suffered the most recent of three arterial spasms or minor strokes , and there were warnings of the major stroke to come . His doctor , Lord Moran , and his private secretary , Jack Colville , a man of superior intelligence and character , went to Lord Salisbury , the elder statesman of the Conservative Party , who suggested that Churchill should he persuaded ( that is , forced ) to repair to the House of Lords , while nominally remaining prime minister . Even Salisbury knew the idea was foolish : " I am afraid he regards us in the Lords as a rather disreputable collection of old gentlemen . " ( Offered a dukedom by two sovereigns , Churchill never accepted a peerage . ) And who would be the unfortunate wretch who would tell Churchill that he was to be put out to lordly pasture ? But they had misjudged him . Churchill had immediately to meet a dangerous motion of censure in the Commons ; and to the amazement of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his speech , ran it yelping from the field . Nigel Nicolson , a backbencher at the time , wrote to his father of the occasion , " He is looking white and fatty , a most unhealthy look , you would say , if he were anyone else , but somehow out of this sickly mountain comes a volcanic flash . " That nicely captures the moving and elevating story that this volume tells . Gilbert devotes his first 650 pages to the years in opposition , from 1945 to 1951 . This may seem excessive . Yet he enables us to see for the first time Churchill 's sustained and often electrifying energy and inspiration out of office . We are jolted , almost at once after the defeat of Germany , even though we know it will happen , by his defeat in the 1945 general election . The votes were not counted for three weeks , so that the ballots of the men and women on active service around the world could be flown home . I remember many foreign journalists , including Americans , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ballot boxes could be kept for three weeks without tampering by the government . In the interval Churchill flew to the opening of the Potsdam Conference . There , on the night before he returned home for the counting of the votes , he had an " unpleasant dream .... I dreamed that life was over . I saw ? it was very vivid ? my dead body under a white sheet on a table in an empty room . I recognized my bare feet projecting from under the sheet . It was very lifelike .. .. Perhaps this is the end . " Two days later , even before they had finished counting the votes , he submitted his resignation to the king . Was life over ? In the Commons and in public he was gracious and magnanimous beyond even what we expected from him . But only from Gilbert 's record do we now see how deeply , and for how long , Churchill felt the wound . It was only painfully that he overcame his " vain repinings . " Above all , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of affairs when , as he told a reunion of veterans of Alamein in 1950 , " destiny compels us after all our victories , to face new , strange , gathering dangers . " But it was precisely this sense of the danger that drew him out of his despondency and galvanized him into action . Wishing to warn and to advise , Churchill was greedy for information , especially about Soviet military strength ( as the British and Americans were rapidly demobilizing ) , and about Russia 's political intentions . He reached to an extraordinary range of contacts abroad , as he had done before the war to estimate Germany 's strength and Hitler 's intentions . In the Commons he pummeled the Labour government with the facts that this " private citizen " had collected . He also passed on some confidentially to Clement Attlee , who had succeeded him as prime minister , and regularly communicated his all-too-accurate forebodings to Truman . Churchill first met Truman at Potsdam . He liked him " immensely , " he told his daughter Mary , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ... simple and direct methods of speech , and a great deal of self-confidence and resolution . " Out of office , Churchill built on this relationship , and in March 1946 the president of the United States escorted him to Fulton , Missouri , where Churchill delivered the speech that defined the nature of the Soviet threat and introduced the Iron Curtain . GILBERT 'S METHOD draws our attention to the pertinacity of such personal relationships . On the day after the German surrender , Churchill found the time to telegraph to three former French prime ministers , to Leon Blum , Edouard Daladier , and Paul Reynaud , his congratulations on their liberation . No one would have blamed him if he had held at least the last two partly responsible for France 's collapse in 1940 . And later that year he sprang to the defense of a fourth , Pierre-Etienne Flan-din , who was being tried for treason for collaborating with the Vichy government in its early days . The court was stirred when Churchill 's letter was read ; the serious charges were dropped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names provide only one example of the network of contacts he maintained around the world . One of the weaknesses of the Western alliance today is that American politicians , notably those aspiring to the presidency , have few , if any , sustained relationships with politicians , soldiers , and intellectuals in other countries . They would do well to recall the extent to which Churchill was his own source of intelligence even out of office . This " greatest citizen of the world of our time , " as Attlee called him after his death , was the least of Little Englanders , the least of chauvinists . He found his own way into the details of the politics of other nations . Churchill did not despise intellectuals , as many of our contemporary conservatives affect to do . Of course intellectuals on politics can be fatuous . But Churchill knew that they also engage in an activity for which there is no alternative , that crosses all frontiers , that limns our first intimations of the future , not least in its interest to explain the past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of his most severe critics after the war was that almost " pure " intellectual in politics , R. H. S. Cross-man , the extreme left-wing product of Winchester and New College , Oxford , darting and mischievous , devious , conspiratorial , capable of standing common sense on its head , and playing pingpong ( as I can vouch ) with a deadly venom ; yet with a value , even seriousness , to which one was stupid not to attend . It is characteristic of Churchill to find him on vacation in Marrakech in 1950 reading The God That Failed , the essays by six former communist intellectuals that Cross-man edited . If Churchill was going to warn the world of the dangers of Soviet communism , he wished to know for himself what he called in a letter to his wife " an impressive study of Communist mentality by those who have recovered from the disease . " Here was a politician who would not have worried about a question about what books he had read recently . THE FULTON SPEECH was not popular at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the train to Fulton and was enthusiastic in his approval . Churchill merely told truths too bluntly . It is valuable to have Gilbert 's full account of its preparation , delivery , and reception ; Churchill could justly claim in a letter to Thomas Dewey in December 1946 that by then it " would be criticized as consisting of platitudes , " and three days later to Frank Clarke in Florida , " Fulton holds its own . " I remember reading the speech the day after its delivery . Europe had just struggled through the first bitter postwar winter . Britain itself was tired , short of rations , dreary . The continent was shattered , exhausted , unfed , unclothed , unhoused . We dreaded each election in France or Italy , because Soviet communism , even with the tyranny , at least seemed to offer some kind of an answer . Then there came this familiar growl from a small Midwestern campus no one had ever heard of . It compelled us to look still more bleakly at the reality . And suddenly there was hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope ? even in 1940 , when Hitler had the continent writhing under his heel ? by staring at the harshness of reality . He would wring hope from the very brutality of the truth . OUT OF OFFICE after the war , Churchill did what one would have thought only a government could do : he was the main founder , inspirer , guiding spirit , and ultimately the proclaimed formal leader of the United Europe Movement . It was a consuming passion . Again Gilbert 's copiousness displays its worth . We find it hard to believe that an aging man could so replenish himself , and us , and Europe , and America , in a cause that was so far-reaching in its vision and its urgency . Churchill loved Europe ? America ? the So , thrown out of office , he put himself into harness . He was all muscle in the cause . " Without the resurrection and reconciliation of Europe , " he wrote in 1946 , " there is no hope for the world . " He tried to pull in allies from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital European conference at The Hague in 1948 , he wrote a six-page letter to Leon Blum to try to prevent a European socialist boycott of it . He wanted the socialists in , too . Blum , recall , an intellectual , a literary man , a Jew , a socialist , the creator of the Popular Front in France , was the enemy , one would have thought , of everything that the high-born Tory represented . Yet to Churchill , Blum was Europe . So Churchill drilled his passion to the laborious task of Forming the United Europe Movement . From Churchill 's inspiration , as George C. Marshall stated when he announced the Marshall Plan , came not only that Plan , but NATO itself . Churchill 's eloquence in peace matched his eloquence in war : President Roosevelt spoke of the Four Freedoms , but the one that matters most today is Freedom from Fear . Why should all these hard-working families be harassed , first in bygone times , by dynastic and religious quarrels , next by nationalistic ambitions , and finally by ideological fanaticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurled against each other by variously labeled forms of totalitarian tyranny , all fomented by wicked men , building their own predominance upon the misery and the subjugation of their fellow human beings ? Why should so many millions of humble homes in Europe , aye , and much of its enlightenment and culture , sit quaking in dread of the policeman 's knock ? That is the question we have to answer . We can speak too glibly of Churchill 's sense of history , as if it was unearned ; as if he saw some technicolor panorama of the centuries , rather like the English codfish now served up as " Masterpiece Theatre . " Gilbert allows us to appreciate more fully the energy of his sense of history . Behind it was a sense of geography . He seems always to be in the Map Room . Yet he did n't really need a map to know where Carpathia was . He knew the limes of the Roman Empire ? its wooden , manned frontiers ? and knew why geographically , strategically , economically , they were drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officeron the North West Frontier of India ; he had been with Kitchener in the Sudan . What remained of a sense of empire in his case was an embrace of the globe . He ruled no one out . His magnanimity to foe as well as friend is celebrated . After the First World War , as Gilbert records , a French municipality asked him to devise the wording for its war memorial . Churchill proposed the words to be set out as written : These words , as Gilbert says , " stand in the opening pages of each volume of Churchill 's war memoirs , under the heading : ' Moral of the Work . ' " Having defeated Germany , he was the first and the clearest , after the war , in seeking reentry of Germany into the European community . Even in Berlin in 1945 he said that " hate had died with their surrender . " At the European Congress in The Hague , he proclaimed , in the spirit of Heine , that one object was to " revive the ancient fame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shortly after the end of the war , in Strasbourg . The ancient city of Strasbourg has always been a shuttlecock between Germany and France . When they go to bed at night , its citizens have rarely been sure if they will wake up the next morning German or French . In a newsreel cinema in 1945 , we watched Churchill address the rapturous multitude in Strasbourg from the balcony of the Hotel de Ville . He rose to his feet , silenced the crowd , peered over his small spectacles , and said , in a caricature of his most grave English accent , syllable by syllable , Pre-nez-garde . **25;3132;TOOLONG . We chortled at the cunning old dog . With a joke , Churchill had made the men and women of that city feel not French or German , but European . He was a healer , like Lincoln . Churchill , the conqueror of Germany in a war that had to be fought , as Lincoln knew the Civil War had to be fought , set out at once to bring the Germans ' mac to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into another passion . He was , remained , and proclaimed himself to be a Zionist . Few of his attacks on the Labour government that succeeded him were more brutal , more contemptuous , than his criticism of its Palestine policy . Ernest Bevin , the great trade union leader brought forward by Chlirchill during the war as secretary of labor , and then dramatically made foreign secretary by Attlee ( one of Attlee 's soundest judgments ) a man who had fought commu-nism all his life in the unions was unlikely to back down before the Soviet menace ? was unquestionably pro-Arab , even anti-Semitic . Churchill , with all his admiration for Bevin , made Bevin look like the scoundrel he was over Palestine , which was , in Churchill 's mind , the historical entity of Israel . Why ? Churchill loved the rowdiness of the Jews . He welcomed members of Parliament banging the lids of their desks in the chamber ; and the best desk-lid bangers in history are the Jews . NO YEARS in opposition , of any statesman , were as creative as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1951 to 1955 . I was a young journalist at the time , an editorial writer on domestic politics for the Times . I watched him , I listened to him , I wrote impudently about him . Gilbert 's account corrects some of my judgments , but reassures me that I was not entirely wrong . Yes , there were the declining powers , of which one was well aware ; but also there were the volcanic thrusts . Consider Russia . A big country . Every country in Europe has lived for centuries under the threat of Russia 's push forward . It is an unceasing source of amazement to Europeans , therefore , that America has no sense of a historic Russia . Americans appear to believe that Russia was born in 1917 at the Finland Station . Churchill was aware , as Gilbert shows us , of the huge presence of Russia . He understood that Russia is permanent ; and that it is almost dangerously religious . He understood also the attraction of communism , a little like the attraction of Cavafy 's barbarians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opposed it bitterly . On the death of Stalin , and on the rise of Khrushchev , Churchill saw a new possibility ( as he would have seen , I imagine , in Gorbachev ) . The real importance of this volume is the tale it tells of Churchill 's turn from the defeat of one totalitarianism to the fight with another , with new forms of aggression , and a wholly other country . The differences between these two struggles , in Churchill 's mind , are striking . The most consistent and forceful opponent of appeasement before the war resisted those after the war who used " appeasement " as a shibboleth to oppose any accommoda tion with Russia . In 1950 , in opposition , he welcomed Attlee 's assurance that there would be no appeasement , but then asked that the word " be more precisely defined .... Appeasement in itself may be good or bad according to the circumstances . " This was a man whose mind was not locked into the past . As prime minister , in advocating in 1954 a policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is " a vast ideological gulf between the idea of peaceful coexistence vigilantly safeguarded , and the mood of forcibly extirpating the Communist fallacy and heresy . " The last years make one ache . Churchill wished only to be released from his mortal coil . He was miserable . Even at the time , one thought of a more or less lifeless whale beached on his overlong , no longer fruitful , life . Gilbert refers a lot to Alan Hodge , the young man who helped Churchill with his remarkable A History of Me English-Speaking Peoples ( notice the plural ) . Hodge was one of my liveliest companions in London . The old man , Hodge related , liked to watch old movies in a private cinema . Like all old men , he nodded off in the middle of it . And like all old men , he would wake up with a start , and say to young Hodge , " Tell me which are the baddies and which are the goodies , and then I can work out the rest for myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did with Hitler and Stalin . Hodge told me of a wonderfully haunting moment . Churchill did not like to be alone , though he felt alone . Once he summoned Hodge to be with him in one of the houses lent to him by rich friends in the south of France . In the chill evening , Churchill stared into the fireplace . The pine logs were spitting and hissing as they burned . Then the familiar voice growled : " I know why logs spit . I know what it is to be consumed . " Waterloo Station , where it would be borne by train to the Marlborough burial plot at Blenheim . In the event , however , the most heraldic feature of this departure was none of Churchill 's doing . As the barge progressed down the Thames , the dockside cranes all dipped as it passed . The sight of these bowing cranes moved a nation ( and me ) to tears . For dockers , stevedores , are a nation 's most Bolshie workers . In Britain , certainly , none of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these proud proletarians , by their own bidding , on a day off , and not on the orders of their employers , lowered their cranes like guardsmen making an arch of their swords over the passing of a monarch .
