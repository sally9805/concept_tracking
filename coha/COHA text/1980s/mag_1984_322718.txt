Missiles hit tanker after tanker as the Iran-Iraq war takes a new turn <P> " Very dangerous , very worrying , " declared an official in Bahrain . If anything , that was an understatement . In the Persian Gulf last week , no tanker was safe from missile fire as the 43-month-old war between Iran and Iraq took an alarming new direction . For months , Iraq 's President Saddam Hussein had been threatening to attack any vessels using Iran 's big oil-exporting facility at Kharg Island . The government of Iran 's Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini had vowed , in turn , that it would respond to such an attack by blockading the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the gulf , choking off the oil lifeline to Japan and parts of Western Europe . <P> In the past month , the Iraqis have started to make good on their threat , using five French-made Super Etendard fighter planes to fire at vessels carrying Iranian oil , including some owned by Saudi Arabia , an ally of Iraq 's , and by other Arab states . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to retaliate by attacking Saudi and Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf . So far , half a dozen are known to have been damaged . None has yet been destroyed , though the Saudi supertanker Al Ahood has been ablaze since it was struck by Iraqi missiles two weeks ago . But on Saturday the Iraqis struck and sank a Greek-owned cargo vessel bound for Iran . Iraq hopes that by threatening tanker traffic , it can prevent Iran from financing its war effort with oil revenues . Iraq lost a large share of its oil production to Iranian bombing raids shortly after it invaded Iran in 1980 . While Iran is probably incapable of closing the Strait of Hormuz to world shipping by military means , it certainly has the capacity to make travel within the gulf so hazardous and costly that shipping companies would be reluctant to send their tankers into the war zone . Already , several U.S. and Japanese firms , including Mobil Corp. , have decided to stay out of the northern third of the gulf , and others are expected to follow suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage for tankers and their cargo in the area . Assessing the situation , a Saudi diplomat observed that all the Iranians need to do to curtail oil supplies is keep up their occasional tanker attacks " and let Lloyd 's of London do the rest . " <P> Fortunately , the world is nowhere near as dependent on gulf oil as it was ten or even five years ago . Constantine Fliakos , a senior oil-trade analyst at Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith Inc. , notes that the closing of the Strait of Hormuz would no longer be a major threat to most Western economies . " We are in a different world now , " he says . The U.S. currently imports only 3% of its oil from the gulf , compared with 13% in 1979 . The general view is that if the gulf 's present output of 7 million to 8 million bbl. a day , 40% of which comes from Saudi Arabia , were to be cut off , the vacuum could be largely filled by increased exports from nongulf producers such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
