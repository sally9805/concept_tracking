Never lend books , for no one ever returns them : the only books I have in my library are books that other folk have lent me . <P> - Anatole France <P> Of all the terrifying circumstances to which one 's home is vulnerable , nothing equals that of a guest who stares straight at one 's bookshelves . It is not the judgmental possibility that is frightening : the fact that one 's sense of discrimination is exposed by his books . Indeed , most people would much prefer to see the guest first scan , then peer and turn away in boredom or disapproval . Alas , too often the eyes , dark with calculation , shift from title to title as from girl to girl in an overheated dance hall . Nor is that the worst . It is when those eyes stop moving that the heart too stops . The guest 's body twitches ; his hand floats up to where his eyes have led it . There is nothing to be done . You freeze . He smiles . You hear the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I borrowed this book ? " <P> ( Mind ? Why should I mind ? The fact that I came upon that book in a Paris bookstall in April 1959-the 13th I believe it was , the afternoon , it was drizzling-that I found it after searching all Europe and North America for a copy ; that it is dog-eared at passages that mean more to my life than my heartbeat ; that the mere touch of its pages recalls to me in a Proustian shower my first love , my best dreams . Should I mind that you seek to take all that away ? That I will undoubtedly never get it back ? Then even if you actually return it to me one day , I will be wizened , you cavalier , and the book spoiled utterly by your mishandling ? Mind ? ) <P> " Not at all . Hope you enjoy it . " <P> " Thanks . I 'll bring it back next week . " <P> " No rush . Take your time . Liar . " <P> Not that there is any known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has friends ; they are bound to meet . Charles Lamb , who rarely railed , waxed livid on the subject : " Your borrowers of books-those mutilators of collections , spoilers of the symmetry of shelves , and creators of odd volumes . " But how are such people to be put off , since they are often we , and the non-return of borrowed books is a custom as old as books themselves ? ( " Say , Gutenberg , what 's this ? And may I borrow it ? " ) It is said that Charles I clutched a Bible as he mounted the scaffold . One shudders to imagine the last earthly question he heard . <P> Still , this custom confutes nature . In every other such situation , the borrower becomes a slave to the lender , the social weight of the debt so altering the balance of a relationship that a temporary acquisition turns into a permanent loss . This is certainly true with money . Yet it is not at all true with books . For some reason a book borrower feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This removes both memory and guilt from the transaction . Making matters worse , the lender believes it too . To keep up appearances , he may solemnly extract an oath that the book be brought back as soon as possible ; the borrower answering with matching solemnity that the Lord might seize his eyes were he to do otherwise . But it is all a play . Once gone , the book is gone forever . The lender , fearing rudeness , never asks for it again . The borrower never stoops to raise the subject .
