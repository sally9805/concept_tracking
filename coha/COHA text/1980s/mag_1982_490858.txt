THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AFRIEND writes : I 've been thinking quite a lot lately about something that caught my attention when I was in Paris for a few days last November . My hotel was a small hotel on the Left Bank , on a quiet street just off the Rue du Bac , and when the porter had shown me to my room and deposited my luggage I walked over to the window and stepped out on a little balcony . It was around ten o'clock in the morning , and the street below  --  three floors below  --  was empty except for the usual every-which-way scramble of parked cars and a derelict curled up asleep in the narrow shelter of a recess in the facade of the building across the way . It was beginning to rain . I unpacked and made a couple of telephone calls and put on my raincoat , and took another look out the window . The derelict , le elochard , was awake and sitting up and smoking a cigarette . He was dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his eyes , and his face below his eyes was masked by a short sandy-red beard . He was either deeply tanned or very dirty : the cigarette was as white as chalk in his hand . I watched him for a moment or two . Sitting there on cold stone in a drizzling rain , he somehow looked almost enviably at ease and content . I went out and rang for the elevator , and when I came out on the street he was gone . I thought , if I thought about it at all , that was the end of that . But it was n't . It was only a beginning . I got back to my room around four o'clock , and when I happened to look out the window I saw that he , too , was back . Just hack . He was where I had seen him before , but standing with a bulging shopping bag at his feet and a roll of newspapers under his arm . He seemed deep in thought . Then he squatted down and carefully spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pallet in his niche . I watched him settle himself , scrunch around and get comfortable , then dig into his shopping bag and bring out a big plastic trash bag and shake it open and work it up and over and under his feet and legs and tuck it around his waist . I watched him dig back into the bag and bring out a bottle  --  a high-shouldered wine bottle . He tipped it up and took a long drink . He put the bottle carefully down , and got out a cigarette and lighted it . He smoked deliberately , with concentration , puff by puff by puff . He rubbed the cigarette out on the sidewalk at his elbow and took up the bottle again . He drank , another long and deliberate drink . He put the bottle back in his bag . He carefully lighted another cigarette . He was asleep when I went out to dinner . He was gone when I returned . I looked down at the empty niche and wondered . It was almost midnight . I pictured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big shopping bag . But where ? And why ? On the way to bed , I looked out again . His niche was still empty . But in the morning he was back . He was wrapped in his plastic sleeping hag , curled up like a shrimp and asleep . I came back to my room for a moment on the way to lunch . And , of course , looked out the window . He was sitting up on the edge of his niche in a warming wedge of sunlight , with a bottle between his legs and a cigarette in his hand . He moved his hand , and I caught a flash of metal . It was a watch a golden watch , with a glit-tering golden band . That was the last I saw of him that day , and he was still asleep when I went out the next morning . But that afternoon , when I came back to the hotel before dinner , he was sitting up with his bottle and his cigarette . And his glittering golden watch . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him drink again . And then he reached into his shopping bag and brought out a book  --  a book about the size of an average novel , with a plain white cover . I watched him turn some pages , turn back , and settle down to read , and then it was time for me to leave . But I carried him with me  --  to dinner , through dinner , hack to my room , and to bed . It was all questions . I knew they could never be answered , but they hung there just the same . Who was this man ? What was he ? Where did he go when he left his niche ? And why ? How did he live ? And on what ? The next morning at breakfast , my last day in Paris , I made up my mind . I had to know something more about him . I wanted , if nothing else , to get a closer look . I waited at the window with my second cup of coffee and watched him wake up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his bottle and light a cigarette . All right . I came out of the hotel and circled around the block to approach him from behind . I came up toward his half ' hidden back . The sidewalk at his side was strewn , littered , thick with cigarette butts , and as I came up he added still another . His bottle was between his legs , his book was open in his lap . I had a five-franc piece ready , and I dropped it into his hand . He jerked up his head . " Hein ! " " Pour vous , " I said , and I moved on . I had had my look . His overcoat had a frayed and faded velvet collar . His eyes were a watery blue , and most of his front teeth were missing . And his book  --  I could n't see the title or the name of the author , but I had a glimpse of an open page , of the arrangement of print on the page . His book was a book of poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Boat Show ( recently at the Coliseum ) was sent to us by another friend , this one an nut-of-town sailing friend : Following the most approved tactics , I skipped the first weekend of the show and went after lunch on Tuesday , when crowds are normally at a low ebb . This time , the ebb was lower than in the recent past , perhaps because of back-to-back winter storms that had covered the sidewalks with free-form gunmetal-gray ice sculpture . On the Coliseum 's main floor , which is , as it happens , the show 's second level , exhibitors ( recognizable by their name tags ) outnumbered visitors by a ratio of about three to two . I have been coming to these things since they were held at the Grand Central Palace , which is to say since just after the Second World War . Not only do I remember the arrival of the first fibre- glass boats ; I even recall the days when just about everything on display was varnished mahogany , and that makes me practically prehistoric . This year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1981 show . I checked my impression with an exhibitor who has worked here for several years , and she agreed : " I think they just turned off the lights last year and then turned them on again Saturday morning . " At least one of the boats on the main floor is definitely different , though . She is the Hunter 54 , proclaimed by the show 's sponsors to be the " Queen of the Show " ? press-agentese for the longest boat on display . ( Most names of boat models include the boat 's length , usually rounded up to the next whole foot ; the Hunter is fifty-three feet eleven inches over all . ) Her prototypes were designed to compete in single-handed and double-handed long-distance racing , but the version available at the Coliseum , for about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars , is a gussied-up cruising yacht , with a great deal of wood camouflaging the basic fibre-glass skin . Compared with the rather bloated vessels that have been in fashion for the last decade or so , she is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rakish look . Her builders have incorporated a number of interesting innovations  --  most notably an eight-foot dinghy that lives in a sort of marsupial compartment beneath the cockpit . It can he launched through an opening in the parent boat 's stern , presumably without the FEBRUARY 8,1982 hurrah 's nest normally created when one attempts to get a hard-shell dinghy from its stowed position upside down on the cabin top to the water , eight feet below . On the fourth , or top , floor is an-other boat conceived expressly for long-distance single-handing . Except for having the same original purpose , she could hardly be more different from the Hunter , however , for she is only ten feet long and appears to he nearly as wide . She is Yankee Girl , in which a Minnesotan named Gerry Spiess sailed across the Atlantic in 1979 and across most of the Pacific , from Southern California to Sydney , in 1981 . In order to accommodate Mr. Spiess for several months at a time , Yankee Girl was designed with a very high cabin top and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote her skipper 's book about his Atlantic crossing ) in the condition she was in when she last sailed . That is , her interior is crammed with navigational equipment and supplies , and , even though as much gear as possible has been miniaturized , the tiny cabin has no bunk and barely room for an average male adult to sit . At the end of his Pacific excursion , which lasted some five months , Mr. Spiess was said to have renounced long-haul single-handed sailing , but one may he permitted to doubt this . Like some of the more dramatic degenerative diseases , the urge to sail alone has no known cure . There are said to be fifteen sailboard firms at this year 's show , exhibiting heaven knows how many different boards . These arc essentially plastic or fibre-glass surfboards , propelled by a single sail whose mast is affixed to the board by a universal joint . The board 's rider stands behind the mast , clutching the sail 's wishbone boom , which extends along both sides of the sail . By varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail vis- ? - vis the wind , he can steer , accelerate , and fall into the water in a number of different ways . All the sailboards seem to derive from a single source  --  the Windsurferand the international sub-industry producing sailboards has for some time been convulsed by a complex and acrimonious legal fight between the Windsurfing International company , which holds patents on some of the crucial elements of the sailboard , and everybody else . At some boat shows , there have been writs and summonses flung back and forth , but on Tuesday , at any rate , there was no visible eviTHE NEW YORKER dence of strife at this one . If there is one increasingly obtrusive category of apparatus at boat shows generally , it is electronic equipment . Most of it has to do with navigation , of course : speedometers , depth sounders , radar systems , and  --  the newest and most popular toys  --  position-finders . These last come in two main types  --  the loran ( an acronym for " long-range navigation " ) and the satellite navigator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of several man-made satellites circling the earth , and receives an accurate position fix about once an hour , which is how often a satellite is within range . Loran , on the other hand , is constantly receiving signals from several mainland transmitters ; it notes the minuscule differences between the arrival times of these signals and translates the data into position lines . In practical terms , all that the owner of a loran or a satnav needs is the ability to read numbers  --  at least , as long as his magic box is working . Once the magic box breaks , as everything on a boat does sooner or later , the navigator is in the soup unless he has mastered the more traditional and tedious arts of position-finding . Not all electronic devices are concerned with navigation , though , as I realized quite suddenly on Tuesday . I paused at the booth occupied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  --  it prepares the government charts , among other things  --  and just as I was picking up a catalogue a loud voice seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I dropped the catalogue instantly , as you may imagine , only to be reassured by one of the N.O.A.A. personnel . " It 's just an electronic alarm , on display in the next booth . They demonstrate it every half hour or so . " Sure enough , examination revealed a device that can be attached to a yacht 's electrical system to warn of forced entry . It will also call out " Fire ! " ? but not , one hopes , in a presumably crowded public place like a boat show . Every boat show seems to have at least one new seasickness nostrum . The one at the Coliseum is in the form of a wristband with a protruding button on the inside . The accompanying literature notes that the source for this device is the Japanese system of Shiatsu , a variant of acupuncture that relies upon constant pressure rather than upon needles . To prevent nausea , the sufferer wears a band on each wrist , with the button pressing down upon the nai-kan point , or " inner gate , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the crease on the inside of the wrist . The bands are available in beige , green , navy , orange , red , or yellow pairs or  --  inevitably  --  in a mixed port ( red ) and starboard ( green ) set . The experienced visitor to any boat show recognizes that the most likely physical problem to be encountered there is not nausea but boat-show feet  --  a malady related to museum feet but exacerbated , as a rule , by a tendency to wear rubber-soled yachting shoes with virtually no support for the arches . Until Shiatsu can be brought to bear upon this difficulty , the only cure is to go away and sit down someplace ? preferably someplace where you can spread the color brochures out on a table while decompressing . Message ends . Rockefeller Wing WE dropped by the Metropolitan Museum one morning last week for a preview of the new Michael C. Rockefeller Wing , a **30;6672;TOOLONG addition to the south side of the museum which is filled with a staggering collection of masks , statues , pottery , jewelry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements from Africa , the Americas , and the Pacific Islands . Douglas Newton , the chairman of the Department of Primitive Art , was quick to point out that the term " primitive art " is an art-historical umbrella that was devised some seventy years ago to cover the arrival in the European art market of a large number of objects from the seemingly less developed cultures covered by the exhibit . " Nineteenth-century progressivism tended to regard these cultures as backward , " he said , " but now we know that most of them were and are highly structured societies , with very complex customs and beliefs . They do have a few things in common  --  a strong faith in magical powers , an absence of what you might call pragmatic scientific thinking , and the use of tools rather than machines . " Mr. Newton , a tall , scholarly Englishman with blue eyes and an aureole of curly gray hair , told us that the wing , which is square , had been divided at the outset into three rectangular sections approximately two hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson Rockefeller and a number of other people . The innermost gallery has a twenty-six-foot ceiling and contains objects from Africa and Mesoamerica . The central section , which has an eleven-foot ceiling , has been subdivided into several smaller galleries , displaying more material from Africa and the Americas and , in addition , artifacts from Polynesia and New Guinea . The outermost gallery , which has a fifty-foot ceiling and a sloping glass wall looking south on Central Park , provides a dramatic setting for some enormous wooden drums and statues that were collected by Michael Rockefeller , Nelson 's son , shortly before he disappeared in New Guinea . We began our tour in the first of the African galleries , admiring two sinuous upright wooden serpents carved by the Baga people of Guinea ; a dramatically lit door that was decorated with a bas-relief of crocodiles and snakes ; and a group of delicate stylized-antelope headdresses that were worn by the Banana tribe of Mali . Then we followed Mr. Newton into the center section , where he showed us a smallish wooden sculpture of a bent-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by the Buli Nlaster , " he said . " A famous piece carved by a remarkable artist who worked in what is now eastern Zaire during the late nineteenth century . We can identify about twenty pieces of his work . " Nearby , we looked at a sinister black Fang head , from what is now Gabon , that had belonged to the sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein ( " African art influenced both sculptors and painters such as Picasso at the turn of the century " ) ; an exquisite ivory mask that had been worn at the hip by a sixteenth-century Benin king ( " The decorative border combines the faces of Portuguese soldiers  --  representing power  --  with mudfish , an ancestral emblem of royalty " ) ; and an impressive group of sixteenth-century Benin bronzes that are technically and aesthetically as good as anything the Renaissance ever produced . We circled back to the Mesoamerican Room , where we were struck by a four-foot-tall dancing figure of red clay which had a curious slit-eyed face and a shaggy garment tied at the back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costume of human skin inside out , " said Mr. Newton . " The priests would sacrifice somebody to their fertility god , Xipe , and dance in his skin , including the face . It 's a custom without parallel in any other culture that I know of . " We moved on to a very large Peruvian wall hanging made of alternating rectangles of blue and yellow feathers . " This was put together from nine matching pieces , which some workmen who were digging up earth to make adobe in a place called Hacienda Espana , in southern Peru , in 1942 , found packed in jars , " Mr. Newton told us . " The hanging was originally thought to be Inca , but now we know it 's earlier  --  about 700 A.D. A lot of the feathers come from birds of the Amazon , and that indicates trade across the Andes . " In the next room , we saw some even more spectacular Peruvian finds  --  two broad-faced gold Chimu funeral masks , one of which was half covered with red paint . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such , " said Mr. Newton . " It had symbolic importance for them , but red did , too . So they painted these masks red before wrapping them up in mummy bundles . " We passed rapidly through North America and emerged in the vast , glass-walled hall containing the mate-rial that Michael Rockefeller had ob-tained in New Guinea -- from the Asmat tribe , in the southwestern region . There was a twenty-five-foot wooden crocodile ; a cluster of three huge , vertical slit gongs , or wooden drums , with carved saucer-eyed faces ; and a series of nine tall , thin mbis , or memorial poles , made up of elongated male figures standing on each other 's shoulders . " In New Guinea , you never die a natural death , " Mr. Newton said . " Either you 're killed or you die by sorcery . And you must be avenged . These poles were put up for ceremonies of ven-geance . The Asmat , who live in a ten-thousand-square-mile swamp , used to be pretty bloody-minded headhunters and cannibals . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we got this roof " ? he led us into a small adjacent gallery that had a low ceiling covered with brightly painted panels ? " are a very nice people , who have a rich mythology , a talent for music , and a local history that includes only one or two stories of cannibalism . " We asked Mr. Newton how the Met had obtained the ceiling , and he replied that he had commissioned it in 1970 , during a field trip to the Kwoma country . " It reproduces the ceiling of a men 's communal house in a village , " he said , " and it was painted on a hundred and fifty individual sheets of sago-palm hark by twenty men , using traditional designs that have been passed down in the tribe for centuries . One crescent-shaped pattern representing flying foxes has also been found on some Melanesian pottery of 1200 B.C. that turned up recently in New Britain . So we think that there must have been an ancient island people who were great traders and made contact with some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What would you like to add to this collection ? " we asked . " Maori things from New Zealand , eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century Hawaiian things , " said Mr. Newton . " I 'd like to find a carved Maori housefront , but it would have to come from an existing collection , because New Zealand has banned the export of antiquities . A Hawaiian feather cloak or a small eighteenth-century wood carving such as the spear-support figure that was recently sold at Sotheby 's would be nice , but prices are high and good Hawaiian items are scarce . That wooden figure , which had been in the collection of a family in Rochester , New York , since 1789 , sold for half a million dollars . But this is such an open field that it 's still full of surprises . You never know from one day to the next what 's going to be dug out of the ground , found in a village , or offered from a private collection . Opening the morning mail can be an exciting experience . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puckered like a dried apricot , we were lurching along an icy stretch of sidewalk on Forty-fifth Street west of Broadway , and when we came to the Bijou Theatre we found it boarded up . Peering through an opening , we saw that the theatre was gutted : its front wall had been knocked down , and there was a big hole in the ? ? roof . Then we remembered about the imminent Portman Hotel and its mall , for which a lot of the block is doomed . Where the orchestra seats of the Bijou had once been , there was now a bulldozer sitting in deep rubble , and a machine with a big claw . Part of the light-blue walls and proscenium were still intact , with panels of fancy floral decorations , which would n't be there long once the cold machines got started up again . A fire had been made in a wire basket , and a demolition worker had moved it near the engine of the claw . We stared at the desolate shell for a while . The stage was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in the illusion , seeing plays here , that that narrow shelf held a reality . Then we thought : The destruction of a theatre is a particularly shocking thing to see , because it is a place based on faith , imagination , and feelings . If a theatre has to go , the curtain should come down , and it should disappear . Next door was the Morosco Theatre , which is also threatened with demolition . We remembered that once , about fifteen years ago , we stood in the lobby of the Morosco talking to an elderly ticket-taker named Samuel J. Freedman . He was a jaunty man who had been in vaudeville when he was young . A Woody Allen comedy was playing at the Morosco then , and if patrons arrived late Mr. Freedman would give them a quick summary of what they had missed . " I know how disappointed they are when they 're late , " he told us . " So I brief ' em , and I cheer ' em up , and they go in smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might he no place left on this block to go in  --  smiling or otherwise  --  and we continued down the street .
