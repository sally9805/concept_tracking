last month , when the thunderous Parisian rains alternated with bright sunshine , the streets of this city were plastered with posters advertising an exhibition of French coins . The posters depicted a glittering gold piece as if it were a work of art . It will take considerable artistry to keep the coin of this realm sound  --  much more and of a more delicate sort than the government displayed in drawing up its 1984 budget . The announcement of the new budget , on September 14 , came at an awkward time for Francois Mitterrand . His Socialist Party had just been rebuffed in yet another municipal election , this one in Dreux , a town of 16,000 voters located in the center of France , an area most Parisians call " la France profonde . " The opposition coalition , consisting of the usual dramatis personae ( the Gaullist-Chiracquiens and Valery Giscard d'Estaing 's Union for French Democracy ) as well as an old force but a new part of the coalition , the National Front , received more than 55 percent of the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried , or so they say . Founded , in October 1972 by Jean-Marie Le Pen , the front is a successor to a movement that was ominously called the New Order , one of the most militant factions of the extreme right in the 1960s . Le Pen , whose party took an astonishing 17 percent of the first-round vote in Dreux ( more than the final difference between the government and the opposition ) , is now busy trying to present the front as France 's " modem right " But on the surface , at least , Le Pen and his party appeal to be traditional , if not Petamist , as his detractors have asserted . " We must , " says Le Pen , " give France back to the French " He frequently refeD to a report issued by the government just before the eiection that put the number of immigrants in France at appioxmiately 6 million , a fig . , e that is viewed with alarm in National Front rhetoric .

The government is frightened about the nation 's financial future . Why else would Mitterrand choose to impose new taxes that kit the " cadres , " the white-collar workers who provided him with a good measure of his electoral strength in 1981 , especially hard ? The most grating of the new taxes announced in the budget is a so-called " progressive surtax , " a flat 5 percent hike in the tax bills of those who pay between 20,000 and 30,000 francs in income tax ( between $2,500 and $3,750 ) . While the 1983 surtax applies only to payments over 28,000 francs , next year 's will be computed on total taxes . For example , a taxpayer who owes 29,000 francs this year pays a surtax on only 1,000 francs . In 1984 , the surtax will be calculated on the full 29,000 francs . This was regarded as a slap in the face by even the most dedicated Socialists , and the right-wing press made the most of the government 's fiscal dilemma : " 1984 Budget ? The Bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on the heels of the government 's 1983 2,000-franc limit on funds that can be taken out of the country , the new tax seemed to many a further encroachment on individual economic liberty . " With my rent , the new sofa and the new baby , " said one young dental surgeon , a Socialist , " I do n't know how we 're going to make it next year . " " To begin with , " said a professor at Nanterre University , also a Socialist , " the Socialists did many stupid things . In the first year , they spent far too much money . They ought instead to have instituted an immediate austerity policy . But they were sure that the so-called economic crisis was the fault of Poor management on the part of Giscard . They were convinced that the economic crisis did not exist . In fact , it still exists ; the Socialists have exacerbated it , and now we are paying the price . " The new budget also includes a more than 15 percent increase in appropriations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arouse patriotic pride . It has succeeded in doing neither . The increase was announced as Mitterrand celebrated the beginning of construction on a large electron-positron collidor , a " superaccelerator " to be housed in a tunnel that will extend from Geneva into the depths of the French Alps . French environmentalists are already up in arms , and few people are pleased to see the state 's money going to a project that will not bear fruit until the year 2000 , if at all . Meanwhile , above all the commotion about Dreux and the new budget , the voice of Jacques Chirac , the Mayor of Paris and the head of the opposition coalition , sounds like a bell clearly tolling the future . After the election , he noted " the growing sentiment among all voters , including those who traditionally form the constituency of the left , not only of rejection of the government 's policies but also of exasperation with the daily sectarian conduct of the Socialists and Communists , who , locked into their own ideology .. . are risking the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chirac 's point is well taken . It was a " national unity " of sorts that elected Francois Mitterrand , causing Parisians  --  with uncharacteristic extravagance  --  to take to the streets with champagne and roses , and it will be the destruction of that left and center unity , aided and abetted both by the rhetoric of Chirac and Le Pen and by the conflicting currents of the government 's economic agenda , that will lead to Mitterrand 's downfall . That will leave the door to the presidency wide open to Chirac , who , albeit more subtly than Le Pen , has for years made it a practice to allude to " the immigration problem " when speaking of the nation 's economic ills . To win , however , Chirac will have to attract in greater numbers than he did in 1981 the votes of those he believes are disaffected with the government 's behavior : the cadres . Yes , his accession would mean a strengthening of the austerity measures already being set in motion by Mitterrand . But under Chirac , the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadres but on those 6 million immigrants , whose existence here is already precarious . ?
