Soon , one by one , Carolina ' s stars of the past trickled in . Mike O ' Koren , who earned all-America honors twice during his three seasons , entered and quietly sat behind one basket . Geoff Crompton , a massive center and a former teammate of O ' Koren , soon followed , as did Al Wood , whose dazzling offensive showing in the 1981 National Collegiate tournament semifinal game is still legend here . Later , Phil Ford , the best pure point guard of his era , made an appearance , too. // It is a daily routine . They come back to mingle with the area ' s young people and to rekindle tales of glory with those players who represent Carolina ' s present and its future. // Each of those former Tar Heels is playing in the National Basketball Association . Yet , as they and others joined the play on the court , most of the eyes on the sidelines kept watch for the most heralded star of all - James Worthy. // Worthy followed a long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play under Coach Dean Smith . In 1972 , there was Bob McAdoo , the flashy scorer and rebounder , who was followed by Bobby Jones , the defensive whiz . A graceful Walter Davis filled the void left by the departure of Jones , and O ' Koren , with his gritty playground style , followed Davis . After O ' Koren came Wood. // Worthy , who is 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 217 pounds , may be the best of them all . As a sophomore two seasons ago , he led the Tar Heels in scoring , with a 14. 2-point average , and rebounding , with 8. 4 a game , He also had 100 assists and 48 steals - all of this with three two-inch metal pins and a six-inch steel rod holding together a previously fractured ankle . Still , Smith said , Worthy was " not normal. " // Smith ' s conjecture proved true last season when , with the rod and pins removed , Worthy performed spectacularly . He led the team in scoring , with a 15. 6-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , during the season . Later , he was selected as the most outstanding player in three phases of postseason play - the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament , the Eastern Regional of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament and in the championship game in New Orleans. // In the final , against Georgetown and its much-heralded freshman center , Patrick Ewing , Worthy showed himself to the world in his typical style : quietly but forcefully . Using the shot that has become his trademark -a crashing one-handed dunk , either on the fast break or at the end of some baseline move - he led the Tar Heels with 28 points in the 63-62 triumph. // Because of that performance , as well as other factors , Worthy , who is 21 years old , chose to forgo his final collegiate season and declared himself eligible for Tuesday ' s 1982 National Basketball Association draft. // He is one of three players - the others are Dominique Wilkins of Georgia and Terry Cummings of De Paul , also forwards - mentioned as most likely to be selected by Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the world champion Lakers trade the coveted choice before tonight ' s trading deadline , it is still very likely that Worthy will be the first player chosen. // Without the restrictions presented by the seemingly infinite array of zone defenses that he faced as a collegian , most basketball observers believe that Worthy ' s game can only be enhanced by the trend toward a more wide-open style of play in the N.B.A. // " He will excel , as he has , " said Smith . " But he will probably be even better because he wants to so badly. " // But Worthy , who is somewhat less than flamboyant , almost reserved , when he is away from the court , has shunned the attention a talent such as his attracts. // For most of the summer , while he was enrolled in three courses toward his degree in recreation , Worthy has held off an inquisitive basketball world . He has made few public appearances - the ones he has made have been primarily at some of Smith ' s basketball camps - and hasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I told him a writer from The Los Angeles Times wanted to come out here to visit with him , and he said he didn ' t have time , " said Rick Brewer , the university ' s director of sports information . " Even I ' ve only seen him once this summer. " // Last week , Smith advised another reporter who had traveled to Chapel Hill to " go home . " He added , " You ' re wasting your time . " Later Worthy agreed to schedule an interview for the following day . He then failed to keep the appointment. // Worthy also isn ' t going to appear at Madison Square Garden ' s Felt Forum in Manhattan for Tuesday ' s draft ceremonies - a tradition that has been followed since Portland ' s Mychal Thompson made an appearance after his selection as the No. 1 pick in the 1978 draft. // " I don ' t get into that , " Worthy was recently quoted as having said . Even his friends and former acquaintances , primarily those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen much of Worthy . " He was sure here yesterday playing , " said Al Wood . " And he played up a storm . " A torrent might be a more apt description of Worthy ' s play last season . Although his consistency throughout the year was one of his strengths , there was one 11-minute stretch against the University of Virginia in the A.C.C. tournament final that highlighted his diversity and epitomized his excellence. // Just three seconds into the game , Worthy slammed home a two-handed dunk . Then he floated a running hook shot over a Virginia forward , Craig Robinson , that was slapped away by 7-foot-4-inch Ralph Sampson . It was called goaltending , however . Later , Worthy was posting Robinson , who was growing more frustrated by the moment , near the left baseline . Glancing once to his right , then twice , Worthy spun left round Robinson , who was still looking right , for an easy lay-in . He hit another slam and followed that with an 18-footer from the top of the key before the Virginia coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Robinson. // By then , Worthy had made each of his first seven shots from the floor , and had an assist and a steal . With that 47-45 victory , the Tar Heels ran their record to 27-2 and added the conference tournament title to the one they earned during the regular season by having the best conference record. // For Worthy , that stretch against Virginia was just a prelude to even greater things . And after his performance against Georgetown and the 7-foot Ewing , it was clear that he was the best college player in the country under 7 feet tall. // Even Smith recommended that he turn pro , so Worthy became only the second Tar Heel to leave for the N.B.A. before completing his fouryear tenure . Smith ' s opinion is held in high esteem by his players . Throughout the year , he also acts as an adviser , and when the season is over he acts as a buffer in other areas , such as a player ' s selection of an agent. // In 1972 , Smith advised Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of undergraduates was called then . McAdoo had been a Tar Heel for only one season , having transferred from Vincennes University , a junior college in Indiana. // " In the fall of his junior year , we sat down and he told me his goal was to play pro ball , " Smith said of McAdoo last week . " So we set a figure . If it was met , we decided he would go. " // It was . And Buffalo chose McAdoo as the second selection of the 1972 draft after Portland had chosen LaRue Martin . Five years later , Phil Ford , who had played brilliantly for Smith at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal , was approached about leaving North Carolina before his final season . " Everyone already knew he was the best point guard in the country , " Smith says . " But he decided to stay. " // That proved to be the correct decision for Ford . He had his best season ever in 1977-78 and was the second player chosen in the 1978 draft . He is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no player has seriously considered leaving Carolina early . Until now . According to Smith , he and Worthy did not discuss the option of turning pro until the season was over . That Smith had earned his first national title was an important factor in the decision , the coach says , as was the makeup of the draft. // " James told me he had two goals , " Smith says . " One was to graduate , which he will do next summer . And the other was to play pro ball . I told him that the timing of where he would go in the draft was important. " // Where Worthy would go in the draft was influenced by whether Sampson decided to leave Virginia . And although both Worthy and Smith contend that Sampson ' s decision to remain in school was not a factor in his decision , Worthy made his announcement on May 15 , less than 24 hours after Sampson said he would remain in school for his final season. // At a brief news conference in a room at an airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It probably couldn ' t be better . Whether he is selected first by the Lakers or second , by San Diego , Worthy will likely sign a contract worth about $500 , 000 a season. // Worthy ' s absence was the subject of much discussion that day in Carmichael Auditorium . " I heard he was studying , " said one player . " Or out of town , " added another . " Or somewhere , " said a third. // But it wasn ' t surprising to those who have known Worthy that just a few days before the draft he had chosen to become a sort of recluse , even around here. // " I was a senior during his freshman season , " said O ' Koren , who recently completed his second season as a New Jersey Net . He then pointed to a spot on the court behind the basket closest to him . " He busted his ankle right there halfway through the year against Maryland. // " He went sprawling across the floor and never played again that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Later , Wood would add : " He was as quiet as he wanted to be . " " I think he tried too hard , " said O ' Koren , describing his first impressions of a young James Worthy . " He wanted to do everything . But we could tell. " // " Tell what ? " a companion , who was sitting nearby , asked . O ' Koren paused , struggling for the appropriate answer . Soon , he described Worthy with what is , among players , the game ' s ultimate accolade . " We could tell that he was a ball-player , " he said. // Smith tells another story . " I was sitting in a gym in Gastonia when James was in junior high , " Smith said , referring to Worthy ' s hometown in North Carolina . " He was playing within the framework of the team , making passes to open teammates and things like that . I remember saying to myself , ' Hey , this guy should shoot more , ' especially since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned early the value of his other skills . When he was 9 years old , a boys ' club with a gym opened near his home . But funds for the facility were low , and for 18 months it had no baskets . Faced with such conditons , Worthy compensated by learning - and dominating - all the passing and dribbling games he and his friends could create. // Now Worthy combines his strength and deceptive speed with passing and ball-handling skills that are unusual for a forward . " In a pinch , he could even play big guard , " says Smith. // What Earvin ( Magic ) Johnson has done for point guards at 6-9 , Worthy may do for power forwards . The kind of well-rounded game each plays , few others at their positions are capable of duplicating. // If the Lakers should select Worthy , he would be a teammate of Johnson . But , Johnson needn ' t worry about his status as Hollywood ' s leading man in product endorsements. // Johnson is known for his beaming smile . By contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his oval face , is almost certain to be known for the look of intimidation . That doesn ' t sell much soda. //
