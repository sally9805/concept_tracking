Both announcements engendered chilly but careful responses from Democrats . House Democratic leaders , while rallying around the American flag and quickly passing a resolution deploring the court ruling , warned that a rush to rewrite the Constitution was unnecessary and potentially threatening to the most basic civil liberties . And the Rev. Jesse Jackson , after listening to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh speak on civil rights in Chicago , suggested that the Administration was placing a higher priority on protecting the flag than on the rights it represents. // At a news conference today , Mr. Bush said he was " strongly committed " to civil rights and equal opportunity " for all Americans . " He added that he had been assured by Mr. Thornburgh that nothing in the recent Supreme Court rulings " jeopardizes that principle or calls into question affirmative action or minority outreach efforts . " <> <> ' Legislation Isn ' t Necessary ' // Mr. Bush added that if the decisions actually turn out to hamper civil rights enforcement " obviously I would want to take steps to remedy the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ' m saying that my advice from the Attorney General is that legislation isn ' t necessary. " // In four decisions this month , the court has made discrimination suits harder to bring , harder to win and more vulnerable to attack if successfully concluded. // Mr. Thornburgh reiterated the view that no legislation is needed in a speech today to the annual convention of Operation PUSH , the civil rights group founded by Mr. Jackson . The Attorney General said the Justice Department would monitor the impact of the Supreme Court decisions , but suggested that they may not weaken civil rights law as much as civil rights groups have contented . <> <> Chilly but Polite Response // " Do these decisions , in fact , stand in conflict with this nation ' s fundamental commitment to insure the provision of civil rights for all Americans ? " he asked his audience , which gave him a chilly but polite response . " Or do those decisions represent attempts by the court to fine tune the complexities of enforcement of civil rights law in America ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed at altering the Supreme Court decisions , which they believe undercut enforcement of anti-discrimination laws . <> <> Burning Flag ' Goes Too Far ' // The President , whose 1988 campaign was built around the imagery of flag and traditional values , said today that he was ready to move on another Supreme Court ruling : last week ' s decision that flag burning could be protected under the First Amendment. // " As President , I will uphold our precious right to dissent , but burning the flag goes too far and I want to see that matter remedied , " Mr. Bush said. // He said he felt compelled to push for an amendment , which a spokesman said the White House counsel ' s office would write as a proposal and send to Congress . There , both parties scrambled to respond to the President ' s announcement. // The House was filled with denunciations , impassioned oratory and political anxiety that members would get left behind on an issue that has sparked a public outcry . Democratic leaders repeated their dismay over the court ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag . But they cautioned against a headlong drive to amend the Constitution and said the problem might be solved with legislation instead. // The Senate has already passed legislation intended to keep flag desecration illegal by rewriting Federal law in a way that would be acceptable under the court ' s ruling. // A constitutional amendment would require approval by two-thirds of both Houses and 38 state legislatures , or two-thirds of the states could petition Congress for a constitutional convention to propose such an amendment . The product of a convention would also require ratification by 38 states . <> <> Touches the First Amendment // " Speaking personally , I do not feel we should rush into an amendment to the First Amendment to the Constitution , " Speaker Thomas S. Foley said at his regular news conference. // " It is a very deeply felt matter and it is also one that touches upon the First Amendment to the Constitution , which is the source of the most sacred personal values of this country - freedom of speech , freedom of religious worship , and freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Edwards , chairman of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights , which would probably hold the hearings on any such amendment , was far more critical . " I revere the Bill of Rights and I think James Madison and Thomas Jefferson would roll over in their graves if they thought we were amending the Bill of Rights , " Mr. Edwards said. // Still , Democrats were clearly wary of falling a trap like the one in last year ' s Presidential campaign , when Republicans hammered Gov . Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts over his veto of a law requiring the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. // Today , the Republicans seemed to be setting a similar trap . Representative Newt Gingrich , the second ranking Republican in the House , asserted that " it would be hard to explain " a vote against a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning . " There is an opportunity here for both parties to defend a symbol which for 200 years has been held very strongly and to reinforce certain traditional values , " Mr. Gingrich said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Foley indicated that he would come out swinging against any attempt to make an amendment a partisan issue. // " Anybody who suggests that there is a party difference in respect for the American flag is using this deep affection of Americans , twisting it , manipulating it , using it for the most base and crass political purposes , " the Speaker said. // House Democratic leaders chose Representative Jack Brooks to introduce a resolution today deploring the Supreme Court ruling , and Mr. Foley noted that he was " a Marine Corps combat veteran. " // The resolution , which passed , 411 to 5 , expressed the House ' s " profound concern " over the Supreme Court decision . Those voting against it were Democrats William L. Clay of Missouri , George W. Crockett Jr. of Michigan , Ronald V. Dellums of California , Gus Savage of Illinois and Ted Weiss of Manhattan. . // Mr. Thornburgh said today that his position was the same as Mr. Foley ' s on how to proceed on civil rights legislation . Both men , the Attorney General said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s decision before acting. // According to Mr. Foley , his position was that the relevant House committees should review the court ' s decisions and determine if legislation is needed. //
