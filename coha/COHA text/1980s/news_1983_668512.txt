Talent emerges in unexpected ways . Take that of Mike Nobel , pronounced no-bell , " like the prize , " he says . Nobel , a 36-year-old native of Birmingham , a town in southern New Jersey , now lives in Gorham , Maine , a rural community 12 miles west of Portland , with Margaret , his wife of 15 years , who is a community health nurse , and their daughter , Carmen , 12 , and son , Aaron , 7 . The domestic details are important because they ' re what Nobel ' s talent - singing , performing - is about . In fact , he ' s converted the circumstances of his domesticity into what , with the proper cultivation , could become a successful recording career . Nobel sings about the family , both his and others ' . " In my family-life songs , there is an undercurrent of pain , " he says . " The pain of my own failures as a husband and father in 15 years of marriage . The shared pain of so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascade of bitterness and hurt and tug-of-wars with children . " Nobel says one of the ways he deals with pain , both in his life and in his music , is humor . A classic example is a song with the resonant title of " Househusband Macho , " which he has composed , performed and recorded for a number of diverse audiences that remain uniformly and consistently fascinated by it . Nobel and his commentary in song are already known to the sizable listening audience of " All Things Considered " on National Public Radio ( NPR ) , the sophisticated news and information program heard daily locally in late afternoon on WGBH and WBUR-FM . Now that Nobel has recorded it , " Househusband Macho " may become known to an even larger audience . " Househusband Macho " is , Nobel said in a telephone interview from his home the other day , sung " in a Big Bad John ' tone , " an allusion to the old Jimmy Dean hit . The song sounds like a Marlboro cigarette theme as well . Listening to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feminine themes . What follows are the lyrics to the song . The " househusband macho " refrain should be imagined as accompanying the thump of a drum : Well he was born in the heat of feminist When women grew tired of domestic chains He saw their plight , he joined their fight He had the guts to set things right ! ( Househusband Macho chorus ) Now there ' s a new kinda man in our land With lonely pride he makes his stand Raisin ' babies is his first love And he works all day in Playtex gloves ! ( Househusband Macho ! ) Well he ' s up in the morning when the rooster crows Frying eggs and layin ' out clothes To his working wife he says , Give ' em hell , honey ! ' Then he hands his kids their hot lunch money ! ( Househusband macho ) Now he gets everybody on out the door Then he tackles a mountain of domestic chores Cleans the whole house when he ' s through He still has time to watch Donahue ! Chorus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him any lip ! ) Househusband macho ! ( He kin fight with a baby on each hip ! ) Househusband macho ! ( He has Ivory Liquid hands ! ) He ' s a mean ' n ' lean , baby-weanin ' , bed-straightnin ' , meal- makin ' , car- poolin ' , Tupperware-sellin ' man ! ! When his wife gets home and falls in a chair He has her martini waiting there She winks her eye and pats his thigh , He ' ll be ready if she needs him later tonight ! Househusband macho ! He can mop a floor ' n ' stand straight and tall Wipe a fingerprint offn ' a wall He lives his life right on the edge And he shoots from the hip with lemon Pledge ! Househusband macho ! Now Clint Eastwood and John Wayne Might look tough on a movie frame But their kind would run the other way If they had to get a baby-toilet trained ! Househusband macho ! So here ' s a warning to all you chauvinist pigs You can laugh at us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re outa ' work and home with the kids You ' ll come to me cryin ' to teach ya the tricks of ( Chorus ) Househusband macho ! ( c ) 1982 by Mike Nobel Nobel says the song is " for men who are primary parents and housekeepers and ( who ) may not feel real good about their lives . " " It ' s a song for men who may feel entrapment , boredom and lack of respect as intense as that felt by many housewives , ' " he said . " It ' s a song that , through humor and exaggeration , gives praise and encouragement to men with the courage and insight to actively share or even take over roles that many men wouldn ' t attempt . It ' s a song that , in an outrageous way , demands respect for the drudgery of housework and the hard work of child care . It ' s a song to enlighten folks who ridicule househusbands . " Nobel says the song grew out of his own experiences as a househusband after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianist/ entertain er " who was not infrequently called upon to render " Moon River " 20 times in an evening . Nobel says he quit that career to save his marriage and his family . In addition to public appearances and performances before social , psychological and political professional groups and community groups , he supports himself by writing and recording jingles for commercials . " For the first two years when my wife went to school and then to work , I lived the role , " he said . " I felt like a housewife . I called myself a househusband ' in quotes . " Nobel says the response to " Househusband Macho " is phenomenal in terms of reaction from both male and female listeners . " In the hundreds of programs I ' ve presented of my family life songs before audiences in churches and community halls , that song is the big hit of the evening , " he said . " It never fails .
