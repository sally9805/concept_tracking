Flocking to an adoption mecca <P> Katrina slept through most of her adoption hearing last week in the sun-washed Charleston , S.C. , courtroom . Her would-be mother and father sat nervously alert . An attractive , wealthy couple from out of state , they eagerly testified about their four-acre country estate , swimming pool and well-protected play area as proof of their parental fitness . Yet it was Katrina , at 15 months all blond ringlets and neatly pressed ruffles , who spoke most eloquently on their behalf . Waking up in time to accompany the woman to the witness stand , Katrina clung hungrily to her side , cooing " Mama . " <P> Katrina 's new mother and father are one of hundreds of couples who flock to Charleston every year , drawn by the promise of easy adoptive parenthood . In most areas of the country , adoption is a frustrating process , burdened by the red tape and interminable waiting lists of state adoption agencies . Although a few other states also allow adoptions in local courts by nonresidents , South Carolina offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-minded newspapers that accept classified ads from couples seeking babies . Federal regulations that are more rigorously enforced elsewhere , like the requirement that state officials conduct a " home study " of the prospective parents ' fitness to adopt a child , are routinely waived by South Carolina 's lenient family-court judges . In 1982 there were six times as many privately arranged adoptions-many of them made by non-residents-as placements made through the state 's official adoption agency . To some , the situation has turned Charleston into a notorious baby bazaar ; to others , it has made the genteel city a welcome haven for couples anxious to secure a child . <P> Katrina 's case was handled by two of the nation 's more controversial adoption lawyers : Stanley ( " Mr. <P> Stork " ) Michelman of New York City , who was indicted but acquitted in 1979 of arranging illegal adoptions , and his frequent collaborator , Thomas Lowndes Jr. , a well-known Charleston attorney who handles more than 100 adoptions a year . <P> The two attorneys encouraged the couple to place an ad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classified pleas each week . Most of the ads promise love for the child and remuneration to the mother . All of them end on a desperate note : CALL COLLECT ANY TIME . <P> The couple 's ad got a response . And after they spent $12,326 in lawyers ' fees and maternity payments , their prayers were answered . Thanks in part to the loopholes in the state 's laws , they whisked Katrina home four days after her birth . Some adoptions can be settled in as little as one day .
