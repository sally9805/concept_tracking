When Roswell Gilbert , 76 , received a life sentence last spring for killing his ailing 73-year-old wife , many Americans were torn . He had unquestionably broken the law ; he had also ended the suffering of a woman racked by Alzheimer 's disease and an agonizing bone illness . Last week , after months of weighing the issue , Florida 's Democratic Governor Bob Graham recommended that Gilbert be released , at least on a provisional basis . Graham asked for a conditional commutation " to permit Gilbert to conduct his appeal from his home rather than from the state correctional system . " For Gilbert to be granted clemency , at least half the six-member state cabinet must concur with the Governor 's proposal . At week 's end two members voiced support of Graham 's recommendation and two opposed it . In prison , Gilbert has lost 40 lbs . and has undergone surgery for a urinary-tract condition . Graham said his proposal " represents an act of mercy extended to an elderly defendant in ill health , and does not indicate that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
