Grand Prix from Pontiac , 28 , seeks position ( right or center ) with forward-thinking franchise . Rare combo of speed and power ( 30 SBs , 29 HRs ) with proven production skills ( .287 , 97 RBIs ) . Asking a little security &amp; a lot of money . If interested in " next Mantle , " contact agent Doug Baldwin , waiting by phone in Seattle . // There 's something fishy going on . Here we have Kirk Gibson , a certified mega-talent who led Detroit to the 1984 world championship and the biggest free-agent prize since Dave Winfield . The situation he covets  --  a five-year contract for , oh , $8 million  --  can be met by roughly a dozen teams . But since the end of the season , Gibson has gotten nothing but cold shoulders from everybody but the Tigers . // No , thank you , say the Cubs . Not us , say the Royals . Do n't call us , we 'll call you , say the Braves . The Braves ? The team that gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money after Bruce Benedict ( .202 batting average , terrible arm ) ? George Steinbrenner and Gene Autry say no , too . // What gives ? Obviously not the owners . Not yet , anyway . They seem to be working under a twofold gentleman 's agreement : Do n't offer more than three years , and do n't poach on another team 's player until Jan. 8 , the deadline for free agents to re-up with their clubs . Gibson is not the only star affected . The White Sox ' Carlton Fisk , California 's Donnie Moore and the Yankees ' Butch Wynegar would also ordinarily be enjoying the blandishments of other teams at about this time , but they have n't even been winked at . // Owners claim they are only exercising common sense , but some people on the players ' side think they may be practicing collusion . Says Baldwin , Gibson 's agent , " It 's pretty clear there was a directive from somewhere . If the market does n't open up , I think the agents and the Players Association will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Gibson is upset that the Tigers wo n't budge from their offer of a piddling , by his standards , $3.6 million for three years . He 's especially unhappy since the club already has players working on very long-term contracts  --  Chet Lemon is signed until 1992 . Said Gibson last week , " For me to sign a three-year contract and then shake hands with Tiger G.M. Bill Lajoie or president Jim Campbell , I think I would vomit . " // According to Dave Pinter , one of the agents for Moore , who saved 31 games for the Angels , " Five , six teams told us to see them after January 8 . Every time I talk to a general manager , he says , ' Come see me after the eighth . We ca n't sign anyone until then . ' " // " I 'm getting a little bitter , " says Moore , who was given a three-year offer from the Angels for a guaranteed $2.28 million only to have it withdrawn as part of the maneuvering . " They tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the way things are going , I 'm not sure they want me. " // Giving the owners the benefit of the doubt , they may just be coming to their senses after years of rash spending . Lee MacPhail , retiring in a few weeks as the chairman of the Player Relations Committee , sent a five-page , parting-shot letter to each of the owners on Oct. 16 . He pointed out , among other things , that close to $50 million is being paid out to players no longer performing , that players on long-term contracts spend more time on the disabled list , and that performance progressively falls off in each year of a multiyear pact . " I just told them what I 've been telling them all along , that they were crazy and running themselves into bankruptcy , " says MacPhail . It also has not gone unnoticed that the more successful clubs in recent years have not resorted to signing free agents . // But the owners ' new tune does sound well orchestrated . Gibson and Baldwin were led to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stature . Then , suddenly , those teams disappeared . // Detroit 's hard line is a little baffling . Gibson is the heart , if not the soul , of the club , a clutch performer who plays hard . He is a local boy who grew up in Pontiac . He has signed six one-year contracts with the Tigers , and his last two ( at $250,000 and $685,000 ) were virtual bargains . // Although Detroit technically has until Jan. 8 to sign Gibson , it has an artificial deadline of Dec. 21 , which is the day Gibson marries JoAnn Sklarski . A few days later , the happy couple embark for Australia , not to return until mid-January . Gibson says that under no circumstances will he interrupt his honeymoon . " That 's a negotiating tactic , " says Lajoie. // Meanwhile , no other team professes a desire for Gibson . " An interesting name , " says John Cox , assistant to Cub president Dallas Green . " He does possess talent . But when you break down his career , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an All-Star team , he 's never hit 30 homers or won a batting title or Gold Glove . " // The most shocking denial has come from Atlanta , where new general manager Bobby Cox said the Braves were more concerned about fiscal responsibility than about Gibson . There are probably a lot of Braves fans , however , who would be more excited by a batting order that had Gibson batting third , Dale Murphy fourth and Bob Horner fifth . It 's probably coincidence , but Cox lost interest in Gibson after Ted Turner had lunch with commissioner Peter Ueberroth . The commissioner says he had nothing to do with it . // Baldwin , for one , thinks that Ueberroth is somehow behind the new bear market . His telephone answering machine carries this message : " Everybody but commissioner Ueberroth please leave a message . If it 's you , Peter , I 'll know by your presence . "
