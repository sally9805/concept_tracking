Four alarming minutes <P> " Urgent . All stations . This is an attack warning . . . Take appropriate action . " <P> <P> At 11:14 a.m. last Wednesday , the Pennsylvania emergency management agency in Harrisburg relayed that message to 44 county civil defense agencies . A conscientious civil defense worker in Lehigh County set off the nuclear-attack sirens and was about to contact the Emergency Broadcast System , which warns localities of a nuclear attack , when at 11:18 a.m. he received another message : " Disregard . " <P> The warning was accidentally sent out by two Harrisburg AT &T; technicians who were installing new emergency teletype equipment . Most county officials chose not to broadcast the message before they could confirm it . Even in alerted Allentown , Lehigh County 's largest city , most residents took the sirens , some dating back to World War II , for fire alarms . Said one practical-minded Pennsylvanian : " An alarm system really would n't matter if there was a nuclear war anyway . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
