Dave Mitchell jokes that when he joined Avon Products right out of high school , he thought the chair  --  man of the board surely must look something like God . More than 36 years later , he 's considerably less awe-struck by the title . . . mainly because it 's been his since 1977 . Between the time he hired in as a $35-a-week mail-room clerk and today , as he oversees the company 's $3-billion-a  --  year international sales , he 's viewed Avon from the ground up . He 's worked his way east , from the distribution branch in Pasadena to the home office atop a New York City sky  --  scraper , and has served in a variety of assignments along the way . Over the years he 's had to figure out exactly how many compacts can be filled by a 600-pound bag of powder ; he 's rung doorbells in Connec  --  ticut , New Jersey and on Long Island ; he 's sniffed , whiffed and passed judgment on doz  --  ens of new products ; and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some 1.3 million  --  approxi  --  mately 5,000 of whom are men . At age 55 , Mitchell staunchly de  --  fies corporate deification . Blond , trim and athletic , he conducts busi  --  ness in shirt sleeves and is on a first-name basis with everyone he meets ? from the maintenance crew , to members of top management , to the delegations of Avon representatives who wander the halls of the home office during holidays in New York City . As evidence of Mitchell 's **26;4662;TOOLONG man  --  ner , one employee offers the tale of a garbled telephone call he once received from the kitchen of the company cafeteria . " Where are you calling from , Dave ? " asked the employee . " The kitchen , " the chairman of the board replied above the din of clanging pots and pans and the splash of running water . " What are you doing there ? " " Eating lunch , of course . " If his management style is casual , Mitchell 's business sense is impec  --  cable , and his decisions are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rection Avon has diversified beyond its famous line of beauty products and into some lucrative , if surpris  --  ing , areas . In 1979 , the world-fa  --  mous jeweler Tiffany and Company was added to the corporate fold , touching off jokes about diamond watches and platinum brace  --  lets being offered door-to-door by bell-ringing saleswomen . " When the acquisition took place , there was a lot of specu  --  lation in the press that Tif  --  fany 's image was going to dis  --  appear , " admits Mitchell . " I remember that the news that night showed somebody selling a $50,000 diamond ring on a customer 's doorstep . But actu  --  ally , we 're scrupulously work  --  ing toward maintaining that very fine , separate Tiffany im  --  age . it 's special ; and there 'll be no mixing or blending . " Avon 's ability to keep its various businesses separate was proven a decade ago when Avon Fashions  --  the com  --  pany 's first diversification ef  --  fort  --  was launched . Rather than using the established cadre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail-order division was organized . The success has been phenomenal . Last year , Avon Fashions distributed more than 62 million catalogs that offered high-quality , tren  --  dy women 's apparel at reason  --  able prices . Customers re sponded with orders surpassing $125 million . So successful has the mail order division been that a line of men 's clothing has been introduced under the name of James River Trad ers . A children 's line is now avail able , and Avon expects to launch at least one new direct-mail business annually in upcoming years . " All this may sound ambitious , " says Mitchell . " But it 's not that dif  --  ficult . We do n't manufacture any  --  thing we sell in the fashion line . Suppliers come in , put on their shows and we select what we want to sell . We have a huge mailing list , a good order-processing center and the ability to create catalogs . That same kind of spirit instilled by found  --  er McConnell five generations ago . " It 's a friendly spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peo  --  ple here who enjoy what they 're do  --  ing and like one another . One of the things that pleases me most is when an employee , one who may not have been with the company very long , comes in and says , ' I just want to tell you that this is really a nice place to work . ' And it happens . " The Avon spirit , past and present , is one of entrepreneurship  --  the ability to recognize a good oppor  --  tunity and the willingness to work hard and capitalize on it . McCon  --  nell did this back in 1886 . He decid  --  ed it made good business sense to manufacture a product consumers quickly use and replace . His prefer  --  ence for selling these wares through " canvassing agents " came from his own experience as a door-to-door book salesman . In his memoirs , written in 1903 , he noted : " . . it seemed to me. . . that the perfume business in its different branches afforded the very best possible opportunity to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the perfume business was the business , the question naturally presented it  --  self , ' By what name are these per  --  fumes to be known ; by what name is this company to be called ? ' " He decided on the California Per  --  fume Co. ( changed to Avon in 1939 ) in honor of a close business associ  --  ate who had relocated to the West Coast . His introductory line of flo  --  ral fragrances was quickly expanded to include almond balm , shampoo , makes it fairly simple . " While clothing and fine jewelry represent new directions for Avon , the most radical departure from the traditional beauty-care products has come more recently  --  just two years ago  --  when Avon purchased Mal  --  linckrodt , a St. Louis-based manu  --  facturer of medical and diagnostic products . Mallinckrodt 's price tag ? More than $700 million . " That acquisition was a big nut for us , " recalls Mitchell . " There were some people on the board of directors who thought the price was too high . But back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as where we wanted to be in the future . I think we 'll be very successful in it . " From beauty care to health care , Avon , it seems , has come a long way in its nearly 100 years . . . a long way since its founder , an innovative traveling salesman named David McConnell , mixed his first batch of perfume in a pantry on Chambers Street in New York and sold it for half what the ingredients cost him . Though separated by 98 years of Avon history , McConnell and David Mitchell share much more in com  --  mon than just first names , identical initials and company affiliation . Chances are that McConnell , who died ten years before Mitchell joined the Avon mail-room staff in Pasa  --  dena , would have approved of the new directions his company has tak  --  en under Mitchell 's leadership . Mitchell , on the other hand , says one of his primary goals upon retirement is to leave Avon teeming with the tooth tablets and witch-hazel cream . Since much of his time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the distribution arm of the business to a rather stern-faced matron named Mrs. P.F.E. Albee of Win  --  chester , New Hampshire . Mrs. Albee may have the distinction of being America 's first Avon lady , but she did n't operate solo for long . She quickly organized and trained a sales force that swelled to 5,000 rep  --  resentatives within a dozen years . " Contrast , if you please , the ap  --  pearance of our office today with that when Mrs. Albee first started out with the California Perfume Company 's goods , " McConnell wrote to his sales representatives at the turn of the century . " Then I had one stenographer , and I myself filled the position of correspondent , cashier , bookkeeper , shipping clerk , office boy and manufacturing chem  --  ist . Today we have a weekly payroll of over 125 employees . . . . The growth of the California Perfume Company only emphasizes what en  --  ergy and fair dealings with everyone can accomplish . We propose first to be fair with our customers  --  your customers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the money ; we propose to be fair and just , even liberal , with you who form the bone and sinew of our business . " The company 's work force and headquarters have changed consid  --  erably since McConnell 's day . Total employment now tops 38,500 , and the home office occupies 26 floors at " 9 West , " an ultramodern office building towering over Central Park South in New York City . However , the past is not forgotten ; an open-door policy prevails . ( " This is not an ivory tower , " says Mitchell . ) Ob  --  jets d'art represent the more than 30 countries where Avon maintains facilities , and pictures of Mrs. Albee and her successors decorate the walls . A further tribute to Avon 's history is the company 's archives , where the Avon product line is traced from the original Little Dot Perfume Set of 1886 , to American Ideal perfume of 1907 , to Jardin d'Amour of 1926 , Topaz of 1935 , Here 's My Heart of 1946 , To A Wild Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1976 and Louis Feraud 's Fantasque of 1982 . Although the company has been Avon on Ice Buying a greenhouse with your Avon earnings may not sound unu  --  sual , unless your name is Linda Shelborne and your sales territory is McGrath , Alaska , where winter temperatures dip to 60 below zero and no roads lead in or out of town . " If you stick a pin in the middle of a map of Alaska , you 'd be very close to McGrath , " she says . " We 're sort of near Fairbanks and Anchorage . . . but not really near . Two hundred miles , maybe ; and of course you have to fly . " Like most of the 440,000 Avon representatives in the United States , Linda launched her sales career to bolster the family coffers . But there the professional similarities end . So remote is her location that she has to phone in customer orders to a woman in Fairbanks who , in turn , relays them to the Lower 48 . De  --  pending on the weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foot . " I 've tried it by dog team , too , " she says . " But it 's a hassle . When the dogs get hot they run very fast and have a tendency to dump your deliveries . Then there 's the problem of finding a suitable place to tie the team while you 're making calls . And if any strays wander by , you can have a fight . . . . " if her problems are unique , so are marked by growth and change , an important constant is the high re  --  gard shared by McConnell and Mitchell for the sales representatives in the field and for the sales tech  --  nique they practice so well . " It 's clear to me that Avon 's founders were , from the very begin  --  ning , completely committed to the concept of person-to-person sell  --  ing , " said Mitchell when he was in  --  ducted into the Direct Selling Asso  --  ciation 's Hall of Fame in Phoenix in 1982 . " That , I believe , is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unshak  --  able faith  --  and continued with un  --  swerving belief that the direct-selling distribution system is the best way to market our goods . They be  --  gan not as merchants who waited for customers to appear . They be her opportunities . McGrath 's popu  --  lation has nearly doubled in the nine years Linda has sold Avon prod  --  ucts . Yet the needs of the 450 resi  --  dents are served only by a general store . Its no-frills inventory consists of groceries , clothing and a basic line of toiletries . All this adds up to lucrative territory for a spunky lady with a sledful of balms , beauty bars , oils and unctions. " 1 kind of have a corner on the market , " she admits . " Out here Avon prices are considered very , very reasonable . Probably the items that sell the best are jewelry , make  --  up and gifts . " Whenever a sales contest is in progress the entire town is drawn into the act . Such enthusiastic com  --  community support has enabled her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she 's more grateful to Avon for giving her a sense of independence than for the incentive awards . " It 's made me feel worthwhile , " she says . " At one point I decided to give it up for a few months , but I found I missed it so terribly much that 1 felt like an arm had been removed . I went through awful withdrawal pains . " Now she 's thinking about her next acquisition . All courtesy of Avon , of course . " I 'm taking flying lessons , " she said . " I 'd like to use my earnings to buy an airplane so I can make de  --  liveries to the really remote villages . " gan as ' go-getters ' . . . believing in positive action rather than passive hopefulness . They said , ' Let 's go for it ' . . . rather than , ' Let 's hope it happens . ' " Such an assertive philosophy suits Mitchell , a self-starter who joined Avon without benefit of a college diploma . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money  --  Avon offered the least , $140 a month  --  but because he liked the warmth of his interviewers and be  --  cause his stepfather advised him that the cosmetics industry was slated for a boom . He never regretted the deci  --  sion . Because he could n't claim an impressive university sheepskin , he set about to catch up with promising employees who could . He enrolled in a management correspondence course , faithfully read through Bus ? iness Week and Fortune and care  --  fully observed his supervisors . He re  --  ceived on-the-job training as he moved from positions in production control , to manufacturing , to sales . Although he describes himself as shy , he proved to be an enthusiastic student and a super salesman . " I probably would n't have been successful selling sheets of steel or automobiles or anything else that re  --  quires a more pressured type of sell  --  ing , " he admits . " But the Avon system teaches a low-key , personal-involvement approach . Ours was never the foot-in-the-door kind of selling . The whole atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact . So , I do n't think my shyness was an inhibitor ; it might even have been a help because people seemed to warm up to me since I was n't pushing all the time . " Because of his own experience , Mitchell is committed to offering training to sales representatives am  --  bitious enough to accept it . Incen  --  tive and education programs such as Opportunity Unlimited and Avon Career Training ( ACT ) are designed to motivate the sales force and make Avon representatives more knowl  --  edgeable . " Encouraging individuals to grow makes our business grow , " ex  --  plains Jim Preston , president of the Avon Division ( direct selling ) of Avon Products . " Representatives need a tremendous amount of infor  --  mation , ideas and support to be  --  come as productive as possible . " This is especially true now , when the average Avon representative ex  --  udes business savvy and is commit  --  ted to a long-term , successful com  --  pany affiliation . " We 're finding more and more that we 're shifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could work somewhere else but chooses Avon , " says Mitch  --  ell . " I think 25 to 30 years from now you 're going to see this company geared toward the career woman who starts her career as an Avon representative and moves up . That never used to be the case . " How far up the Avon ladder might a woman climb ? To the top , accord  --  ing to Mitchell , who seems to relish the idea . He admits an attractive chief executive such as Mary Kay or Estee Lauder is a real asset in the cosmetics business and she would be most welcome at " 9 West . " " In all honesty , yes , that would be a plus because most of the prod  --  ucts we sell today are through wom  --  en to women for women . I would think certainly a woman has to have a better feeling for and better judg  --  ment on that sort of thing than I have , " he says . " While there really have n't been a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions , when it happens  --  and it will ? Avon is the kind of company where you would expect to have a woman surface as chief executive officer . " In the meantime , Avon continues to promote women in a variety of other arenas . Company leaders are so appreciative of the loyalty ex  --  hibited by the Avon representatives and customers over the years that Sweet Smell of Success Occur ! did n't just happen . Ros  --  es , Roses by any other name might have smelled as sweet but might not have survived the first sales cam  --  paign . Without their sleek packag  --  ing , Timeless and Unforgettable might have been neither . " Everything has to work togeth  --  er , " says E. Peter Raisbeck , Avon group vice president in charge of marketing . " You ca n't put a heavy , serious fragrance into a light , floral-type package . And names are hard  --  er and harder to come by . Some  --  times we get right down to the end , and everything 's ready to go but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California Perfume Co. , its sales force of high-button-shoed matrons could offer no-frills vials of only five " odors " : Violet , White Rose , Heliotrope , Lily of the Valley and Hyacinth . Not so anymore . " We introduce about 100 prod  --  ucts a year in the cosmetics , fra  --  grances and toiletries segment of the business , " explains Raisbeck . " Of course , each fragrance line might have ten items in it , so in terms of major brand introduc  --  tions , we do about 6 or 7 per year . " Fragrances such as Honeysuckle , Roses , Roses and Wild Jasmine are still at home in Avon display cases but are now joined by more sophis  --  ticated scents to suit contemporary tastes . Tocarra , packaged in cosmic blue and silver , is touted in Avon catalogs as " mysterious and capti  --  vating " ; Tasha , in pink and burgundy , is " dreamlike , fanci  --  ful " ; and could Foxfire , red and gold , be anything but " incredibly intimate and sultry " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is charged with the task of determining what will ring America 's bells in the future . " We 're finding as more and more women work , their tastes are becoming more contemporary . A woman who , five years ago , liked buying those homespun packages is just a little more sophisticated to  --  day . She may not be your Bloom  --  ingdale customer , but she 's certain  --  ly a Macy 's customer . She knows what 's going on . " Input from Avon customers and sales representatives is solicited before and after a product 's devel  --  opment . New ideas are generated during discussions when representa  --  tives trade ideas on what they think might sell well in the market  --  place . Once a product concept has been put into the system , a consum  --  er panel tests various formulas against each other and then against the competition . The fine tuning that takes place in the laboratory usually results in a line that boasts Avon 's customary sweet smell of success . A recent triumph was Fan  --  tasque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a blind-test basis , it 's the most successfully rated fragrance we 've ever marketed , " says Rais  --  beck . " Actually , the line was devel  --  oped for Europe . Before we launched it here we fretted , because the designer , Louis Feraud , is n't a household name in the U.S. " Not to fret . Raisbeck attributes Fantasque 's fantastic success more to the product than to Americans ' preoccupation with designers . In simple terms , he says , it smells  --  to borrow a phrase  --  Fantasque . " It 's kind of like wine . You can tell you 're smelling something that is fine rather than just ' nice . ' " The price of Fantasque is about double the cost of most Avon fra  --  grances , but has caused few cus  --  tomers to bat a well-curled eyelash . Household budgets seem to contain built-in stretch when it comes to products that make the lady of the house feel , smell and look good . " I think in the future we 're going to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicts Raisbeck . " A wom  --  an wants to think these products make her look younger , and I think , when used properly and con  --  sistently , they will at least keep her from looking older as fast . We 're spending a lot of time , effort and money on this , and we 're consulting with some outside medical people . " So the Fountain of Youth is still high on every woman 's wish list . But it may be as elusive as ever . " We 're working on it , " says Raisbeck . Then he laughs and pats his head : " That and something that will grow hair . " A von continued from page 47 money is needed , we 'll give it to them . " Such a benevolent attitude is part of the " Avon spirit " fostered in the early days by McConnell and pre  --  served today by Mitchell . It 's an outlook he has every intention of leaving intact when he retires . For that reason , he plays an active role in recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tions . He 's particularly impressed by persons with a high level of com  --  pany loyalty , an appreciation of the past , creative ideas for the future and a willingness to pitch in and see a project through to completion . " Loyalty is instilled by example , " he says . " I think the top of an or  --  ganization sets the pace , and people tend to emulate their leadership . If you 've got a man or a woman whose coattails are flying , people perceive him or her to be a mover . And that filters down and , before long , you have movers at every level of the ladder . " Mitchell , much like Avon founder David McConnell , is a mover . His pace is quick enough to lead the company into its second century at a winner 's clip , but not so fast as to miss the faces along the way . He cites a favorite story of an elderly lady who retired as an Avon secre  --  tary several years ago , but who con  --  tinues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk out of habit and loyalty . " I passed her on the street the other morning when I was walking to work , " says Mitchell . " I did n't recognize her because it was bitter cold and she looked like a tiny mound of clothes  --  just scarves , coat , hat and boots . When I got around in front of her , sure enough , it was Virginia . " He laughs and adds , " You know , there 's a sort of mystique about a chief executive officer 's job , but if you 've got a little common sense and a lot of good employees like that , it 's a piece of cake . " Of Mitchell 's January 1 , 1984 , re  --  tirement Hicks B. Waldren , the new president , chief executive officer and board chairman , had this to say : " Dave Mitchell has made many fine contributions to the future of Avon . All of us at Avon look forward to his continuing support as a member of the board of directors and wish him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flying Saucers continued from page 87 only the speed of light ( 186,000 miles per second ) is consistent . So , utilizing the Doppler principle , we are able to measure our universe and gauge the speed with which we ap  --  proach or depart any other star system in the universe . ( The Dop  --  pler principle : The colors of light change in direct proportion to the speed of an object traveling toward us or away from us and move up or down the color spectrum . You 've probably noted the same effect with a train whistle or car horn  --  the pitch gets higher as the horn ap  --  proaches and lower in tone as it de  --  parts . Remember the pulsating col  --  ors on our reported " flying saucers " that shifted from yellow to red or green to blue , etc. ?

If they were observable to you on Earth as they flew at a speed approaching that of light , they would appear to make instant right-angle turns at 5,000 miles per hour , although the time travelers them . selves ( during the ten seconds you observed their amazing perform  --  ance ) would be living " slower " and thus perhaps having a full hour to execute the maneuver at very com  --  fortable speeds and to exert no more " G " force than a normal turn in a jet airliner .
