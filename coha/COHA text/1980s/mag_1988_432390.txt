 | He has been a temple elder in Atlantis , a teacher of the occult in ancient Egypt and a Tibetan lama . In the here and now he is Frederick Lenz , 37 , of Malibu , Calif. , and Stony Brook , N.Y . Lenz is known to his followers as " Zen Master Rama " and to the public as Oh yeah , that guy ? the one who advertises his meditation seminars with stylish twopage ads in The New York Times , the Los Angeles Times and Vanity Fair ; the one who plastered his face on giant posters in Times Square last fall ; the one who looks like Richard Simmons . A strong believer in Zen and the Art of Publicity , he spent an estimated half-million dollars on advertising in the last six months . At the moment , though , he is having some serious publicrelations problems . In recent weeks ex-followers have dogged the meditation guru with allegations of emotional and sexual coercion . In mid-January he canceled seminars at Carnegie Hall and the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week ran a devastatingly critical profile called " The Cosmic Seducer , " claims to have been roughed up by Lenz 's bodyguards and plans to sue . Last Thursday , lawyer at his side , Lenz sat down with NEWSWEEK 'S Pamela Abramson for his first interview since the unpleasantness started . " I do n't encourage people to do anything except meditate and make free choices , " he said . Express lane : Lenz claims to be one of the 12 truly enlightened beings on the planet . ( Obvious question : who are the other 11 ? " I 'm not at liberty to say . " ) What he promises is an easy way to Nirvana . Buddhist tradition holds that there are two paths to enlightenment , the fast and the slow ? the slow one takes thousands of lifetimes , while the quick one can lead to enlightenment in just one . Lenz 's path , a third , might be called the express lane . He claims techniques so powerful that an hour with him is worth 100 years of traditional meditation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80s , it should n't be surprising that he promises a payoff which is as much material as spiritual . " Gain the competitive edge through Zen , " one of his ads promises . " A lot of people I meet in self-discovery are not doing very well economically , " he says . " They never could see the integration between the material plane and the spiritual plane . Material success , if it 's part of a balanced approach to life , is very healthy . I do n't consider poverty to be spiritual . " By this measure , Lenz is a very spiritual being indeed . A former disciple of Hindu guru Sri Chinmoy , Lenz holds a doctorate in English literature from the State University of New York at Stony Brook . He moved to California from Long Island in 1980 , under instructions from Sri Chinmoy to open a laundermat and learn humility . Instead he started his own group , switching from Hindu to Zen doctrine in 1986 . Today he rents Goldie Hawn 's home in Malibu , owns two Porsches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to come from his core group of followers , with whom he meets in Palo Alto or Los Angeles ; each of the 400 pays $600 for a monthly session . ( Rama Seminars Inc. is a for-profit corporation and so pays taxes on its income . ) Most recently Rama 's traveling seminars have been offered free to the public , although in the past he has charged up to $400 a head for a four-night session . For a while Lenz had a cash-only policy at the public seminars , and high denominations at that , because smaller bills are " low vibed " ; now he also takes credit cards . Two ex-followers recently gave reporters their versions of what it was like to study with Lenz . One , a 36-year-old graduate student from Los Angeles named Anny Eastwood , claims that Lenz invited her to Malibu for a " private meditation . " She was taken aback when he began to ask personal questions . This went on for six hours , she claims , at the end of which time he allegedly waved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stayed with the group for 11 months after the incident . Another , Mercedes Hughes , 24 , says she was seduced by Lenz in Los Angeles and became his mistress . He bought her $17,000 worth of clothes and moved her into his New York house , where , she claims , " he gave me LSD . He said that I had gone to the dark side and that he was the only one who could save me . " Donald Cole , 23 , committed suicide in 1984 because he was disappointed at his  | progress in the program . He left a note that read : " Bye , Rama , see you next time . " Lenz admits that he had affairs with both Eastwood and Hughes , calling them " voluntary " and adding : " They wish to discredit me for whatever emotional reasons they might have . " He claims that profit-hungry deprogrammers are behind a campaign to discredit him . A deprogrammer , not surprisingly , disagrees . Says Joe Szimhart of the Cult Awareness Network , who worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a spiritual crisis in this country . New Age gurus are feeding off it . It seems that anybody can sell metaphysical snake oil and get away with it . " Strong stuff . It seems only fair to give Lenz the last word .
