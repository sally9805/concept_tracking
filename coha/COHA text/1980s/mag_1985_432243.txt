 | WHATEVER you have heard about Mexico City ? good or bad ? may well be true . It is , or soon will become , the world 's largest megalopolis , growing tumorously from some 16 million now toward 30 million inhabitants by the end of the century . If you are a tourist with United States dollars , it is , as a newsmagazine reports , a peso paradise . ( My own large suite in an apartment hotel cost less than ten dollars a day . ) Gardens still explode with flowers yearround . Artists use colors as hot as jalapenos , and guitars throb like a stubbed toe . Pink Zone shops still sell abundant jewels and Paris fashions . Elegant restaurants and noisy discos stay full of los juniors , or pampered youths . It 's still a " city of palaces , " as Baron Alexander von Humboldt once called it ; new palaces , however , are often owned by retired politicians or policemen . And such palaces attract a folklore as rich ? and maybe as spurious ? as El @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a house with 14 bedrooms , " says one informed gossip , " and each bedroom has its own swimming pool . " " The antique door to the new house of Senor X , " says a guest at a fashionable dinner party , " cost $200,000 ? U. S. " If you are an impoverished rural Mexican , your national capital still represents ? even in this financially troubled time ? a chance for a better and longer life . But an uncertain chance : " You 've seen the city dump ? " asks a photographer friend . " People live in caves ? caves in the mountains of trash . I 'm afraid to work there . " If you are a city planner , Mexico City is a " case study in urban disaster . " A headline writer says " Time Bomb . " The celebrated novelist Carlos Fuentes calls it the " great flat-snouted and suffocating city , the city forever spreading like a creeping blot . " Journalist Ana Flashner ? noting the 11,000 tons of gaseous waste emitted each day into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Monstrous City to the daily newspaper El Sol de Mexico . And Carlos Hank Gonzalez , after six years as mayor , compared the job of administering the city to " repairing an airplane in flight . " Hydrographers and engineers point out the grave problems of Mexico City : one of the few major cities in the world so far from a source of water , a city standing on the mushy , sinking soil of an old lake bed and girded by mountains that prevent dispersion of the smoke from some 30,000 factories and nearly three million motor vehicles . Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado ( page 175 ) has observed that " Mexico City 's growth and gigantic size are alarming and out of all known proportion . " One demographer jokes , " Our optimists count on an earthquake or atom bomb . " I AM NOT that kind of an optimist . As an old and worried friend of Mexico City , I have lately examined the worst deformities of its slums ? lost cities , as they 're called ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and museums . I have watched its organic life from helicopters and subway cars and even within new sewer lines 30 meters underground . Most of all , I have talked to all kinds of chilangos , as residents of the capital are often called . From them I perceive the one fact that confirms both optimism and pessimism : This city is still very Mexican . And if Mexicans seem short on self-restraint , they are brilliant at improvising . Mexicans are gregarious and warmblooded . Thus their scary national birthrate ? 34 per thousand population in 1980 ( more than twice that of the U. S. ) . It is estimated that in the capital 30 percent of the families sleep in a single room ? and those families average five people . Aside from Roman Catholic tradition , numerous children prove a man 's machismo and a woman 's fertility . " But children are also an investment for old age , " a student told me . Recent trends suggest significant change . " Mexico 's family-planning program is a National Geographic , August 1984  | model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nationwide , population growth is slowing , from 3.5 percent in 1970 to 2.4 in 1982 ( see article , pages 179-85 ) . " Many Mexican priests condone contraception , but we do not condone abortion , " a Jesuit told me . And abortions , though widely performed , remain illegal . If large families bring large problems , they also furnish some solutions . Relatives take care of each other , and in a land lacking unemployment insurance , this is a fact of survival . " My brother sends money from Texas , " explains an unemployed plumber in the Zocalo , the city 's central square . " I live with my uncle 's family , " says a newly arrived job seeker from Hidalgo . But the very population density ? along with a Mexican sense of neighborhood and a year-round outdoor climate ? provides another service , creating the condition that urbanist Jane Jacobs calls " eyes on the street . " Sidewalks are alive and noisy with vendors selling tacos and lottery tickets , children at play , gossipy nursemaids and loiterers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little escapes notice on Mexico City 's informally self-patrolled streets . Sometimes a ratero , or pickpocket , does his lightfingered work . But violent crime is rare . I feel safer in the capital of Mexico than in any large U. S. city . Even so , along with unemployment , some sorts of crime have risen ? especially auto thefts , an appropriate felony since greater Mexico City is both shaped and afflicted by the motorcar . ( Motor vehicles , for example , cause 70 percent of the air pollution , widely regarded as the world 's worst . ) Today the urban area spreads over more than a thousand square kilometers ( 400 square miles ) , 550 within the Federal District and the rest along highways in the state of Mexico . To the northwest , at Naucalpan de Juarez , factories stand at the roadside , some at parade rest , with shifts cut back these days . Other plants spread west along the Toluca highway . But it 's in the center of Mexico City that the motorcar brings its noisiest implosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like skin grafts . Diesel trucks and city buses lay down solid-state smoke screens . Exhaust fumes 148 shimmer . And dimly visible above it all is that new monument to the internalcombustion engine , the Pemex Building , seat of the government oil monopoly , Petroleos Mexicanos . " The tallest building in Latin America , " taxi drivers boast . So it is , at 52 stories ? though four projected floors were decapitated for austerity . And rumors of scandal swirl around Pemex almost as thick as the smog . Yet , even traffic jams have a curiously Mexican quality . At stoplights drivers can buy newspapers , bouquets of flowers , or rugs , or watch fire-eaters perform for tips . Along the streets and shops , handlettered signs tempt , warn , and proclaim in a personal way : " Have a beautiful nose without surgery . " " No parking ? tires punctured gratis . " " It is agreeable to be important , but it is more important to be agreeable . " " If God permits , here will be located a vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . " MANY OF TODAY 'S struggles were once known by the Aztecs , or Mexicas . They founded the city upon the mud of Lake Texcoco six and a half centuries ago . As compulsive warriors , they conquered their neighbors , taking over whole cultures as well as lucrative imperial tributes . This Mexica capital , with perhaps 200,000 people , was already one of the world 's greatest and most opulent cities when Hernan Cortes and his conquistadores arrived in 1521 . Many current attractions ? from temples to tacos to tianguis , or street markets ? were already part of Mexica life . Even more , as poet-philosopher Octavio Paz explains it : " The fact that the whole country was given the name of the city of its oppressors is one of the keys to the history of Mexico . . . . " Paz refers to an unbroken " thread of domination , " so that " the Spanish viceroys and the Mexican presidents are the successors of the Aztec rulers . " Even now mayors of Mexico City are still appointed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of centralization and enjoyment of city pleasures , the Mexica trend continues strong . The capital concentrates both market and labor force for more factories ? and still greater growth . Today Mexico City accounts for @#  | roughly one-third of the whole nation 's factory and commercial jobs and two-thirds of the national bureaucracy . Plans for decentralizing the population consistently fail . Why ? " Remember , " a wise friend once warned me , " all of us Mexicans have something to hide . Maybe a bribe given or taken , or taxes that we owe . Take my dear old aunt : She goes to Mass daily but drives her car without a license . When a policeman stops her , she says , This is your chance for a good deed today . ' She gets away with it . " City planners conservatively estimate that half of the city 's population lives in irregular housing . " Either the title is faulty or construction does not comply with the code ? something is wrong , " notes city planning director Javier Caraveo . Although city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of urban development here , according to planners . " No one puts his best effort into a house if his ownership is insecure , " says director Caraveo . On public lands , squatters usually get clear title after five years of " pacific possession in good faith . " Scientific city planning in Mexico City dates only from 1980 , but the staff of young architects recruited by Caraveo ( their average age is 33 years ) are able and eager . In spite of budget cuts they continue to attack the city 's broad spectrum of problems . Like water : a problem that varies from annoying to critical . Since 22 percent of all Mexicans live here on less than one percent of the land , much of the water must be brought in from outside the Valley of Mexico . And since the city is like a bowl sitting on a tabletop , pumps must lift the water and waste coming and going . Furthermore , most rain comes in summer storms and immediately runs off . " It 's a paradox , " notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of rainwater while bringing other water in . " The water costs eight billion pesos ( 47 million dollars ) a year ? 70 percent of which is subsidized by the government . Almost no rain falls from November through April . The city then goes dusty and yellow with its annual drought . A new administrator confided to friends in his coIonia , or borough , " My first official decision was to murder our park . " A dramatic way of saying that the water shortage had forced the neighborhood to quit watering the grass . On a rainy September 9 , 1981 , the famous artist Feliciano Bejar faced another sort of water problem . At dusk he was the only adult home in his studio compound with ten children , two of them babies in arms . " I had lived here for 30 years ? since San Angel was country ? with no disasters . But when highways and more houses were built ? when we paved ? I knew a flood was possible . So I put special doors on the level below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evening . It arrived ? " almost to my chin " ? in a swelling torrent . " I called for help and a neighbor came , but he was knocked unconscious and disappeared in the water , " Don Feliciano recalls . Water was soon seven meters deep in spots . " We had to swim and hold on to the limbs of trees , " he remembers . But by carrying small children and helping the older ones , he got all the household to higher ground . The Bejar studio , house , and 15,000-volume library were wrecked ; some 400 paintings required restoration . " The next day , " the artist recalls , " the mayor came to see the damage . He told me , This is the only city that puts its rivers into the sewer . ' " I lost material things , but some people ? the sick who could n't move ? drowned . All the damage was due to bad planning . So sad . And trees are dying in Chapultepec Park for lack of air and groundwater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven separations in the Xochimilco aqueduct during 1979 alone . Leaks waste water wantonly , and pipes simply do not last as long here as in other places . The Cutzamala River Basin project , underwritten by the Inter-American Development Bank , should solve the city 's water needs for a time ? provided that leaks are kept to a minimum . But the equations of earth and water have other ironies . The soil is one part solid to five parts water , so as pumps remove groundwater , the city sinks as much as ten inches a year ? making deeper drain pipes necessary . The sinking , though , is not uniform : The famous Angel statue , erected on the Paseo de la Reforma in 1910 , rests on pilings set deep in solid ground . Buildings and streets @#  | around the statue sink , so that every few years El Angel needs one new stairstep for its pedestal ( page 161 ) . El Angel thus seems to be ascending , gradually , into a smoggy sky . The soil mechanics produce puzzles for engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump out just enough water ; too much pumping would cause nearby buildings to sink even faster . And to excavate for large subway stations , engineers must match the weight of the material they remove with a heavy building above ground ? to keep the underground station from popping to the surface . " If we had no building on top , we would  | need a heavy slab , " said one engineer . " Instead , a heavy office building also provides rental income . " The very existence of Mexico City 's subway seems miraculous . Initiated in 1969 with 11.5 kilometers of track , the system now has 104 kilometers ( 65 miles ) and is still growing . " Every day four million people go down into the Metro ? and all of them come out , " notes one engineer with some wonder . The subway fare ? at one peso , or less than one U. S. penny ? is the world 's cheapest . The subway carries twice as many passengers as city buses , but still fewer than private automobiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the Zaragoza station , east of the city center . Men were scuffling for place in serpentine lines ; women waited , crowded but less aggressive , in a separate area . Children stood , a bit bewildered , in a kind of holding pen ; they would join their mothers before boarding the subway cars reserved for women . I heard of no Mexican women who resented subway segregation . Those I talked with seemed relieved not to share rush-hour cars with working-class men . The trains themselves seem wise . Once I was permitted to drive one briefly , set on  | automatic control , my hand on the deadman switch ; had I fainted or expired , my faltering touch would have stopped the entire subway line . Green lights flashed past me as the train coiled through the tunnel . The high-frequency whine changed pitch , we slowed , then stopped at a station ; passengers flooded off and on . I had done nothing to cause these events , except to live . But what would happen if the power failed ? Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For three hours the city stopped ? no electricity , no TV or radio , no elevators , no telephones , no traffic lights , no Metro . Seven subway trains were caught between stations with some 1,500 people on each train . Auxiliary lights came on , and passengers got off and walked to the closest stations . Exciting , excitable , individualistic Mexico City had improvised . Citizens reported no assaults , no bad accidents , no deaths . ON MORE PROSAIC DAYS , each of the city 's thousand neighborhoods has a self-reliant routine of its own . Take the place where I live whenever I go to Mexico City . Mine is an unfashionable street in Colonia Cuauhtemoc . My neighbors and I enjoy a cheery mix of small shops , apartments , and private houses , and an animated current of the good and bad of Mexico City street life . From my kitchen window I have a cubist 's view of rooftops ; a laundress hangs wet stockings on a clothesline , guarded by a fat old dog round as a balloon . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisily by day , ebbing late at night under a streetlight 's jack-o ' - lantern glow . As I come and go on errands early and late , neighbors recognize this graying gringo with a buenos dias , and night watchmen touch their caps . At 5 a. m. our community drowses in the dark ; a street sleeper and his toddler son huddle in a doorway under a counterpane of newspapers . At six a trash picker browses through our refuse , and a taxi slowly cruises Calle Rio Lerma seeking an early fare . A sweeper wearing high-visibility orange attacks the sidewalk litter with a pushcart and a crude witch 's broom . At 6:30 the corner fruit vendor opens his kiosk , offering fresh-cut papayas to domestics hurrying to work . Suffocated sounds come from the  | corrugated-metal doorway of our local saloon , a pulqueria : voices , the rasp of scrub brushes , and a murmur of radio music ? a saloon humming to itself . The lunchroom , its stools still stacked on tabletops , smells of coffee and empanadas . At eight our market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid flirts with the young butcher , and a widow crumples some damp pesos as she bargains for yesterday 's wilted produce . ( With her change she buys a bouquet of daisies . ) Traffic now surges in the street , and midmorning sunshine , though hot , grows fuzzy with smog . A man carrying a large sack of merchandise musically chants his business : " Buying ? shoes , curtains , rugs . " This oneman conglomerate will sell his rummage on poorer streets . He is followed by our roving plumber , who announces his presence by blowing three notes on a pipe . ( " He speaks like the birds , " laughs a bootblack . ) All our shops are open now ? the dry cleaner 's , the stationer 's , the picture framer 's . Business slacks off for lunch at 2:30 , and idle taxi drivers play checkers with bottle caps in the shade of a tree . The neighborhood gets a second wind at five . Moviegoers start to line up at the box office , and lovers hold hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobbles up on aluminum crutches , one hand outstretched , his head tilted piteously ; his clothes are good , and so are the coins my neighbors give him , for in Mexico , day or night , personal charity survives , and no one is anonymous . So it is a city of newcomers rather than of strangers . But what is the attraction ? Well , some have no choice , like the baby boy I met in the splendid , antiseptically scented Social Security Hospital in San Angel . The still unnamed five-and-a-half-pound son of one Senora Marcela Monroy de Jalapa , this baby had , for one moment , held the fleeting title of Mexico City 's newest citizen . Some 360,000 other babies are born to chilangohood each year . Older citizens migrate here by choice or by necessity . You can spot the new arrivals easily at the Eastern Bus Terminal ? a thousand of them come each day ? wearing country clothes and expressions of confused excitement . Not , though , a woman I saw there one afternoon , weeping desperately into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Puebla , " a ticket seller explained . " And a robber has taken all her money . Poor little thing . " What would she do ? Go hungry ? Beg like uncountable professional mendicants here ? " Women can usually find work in the city ? unlike so many unskilled men , " explains social anthropologist Maria del Carmen Elu de Lenero . Studies even confirm the existence here of a " subproletarian " group , where women , as the more certain breadwinners , choose and discard their menfolk , in a kind of matriarchy , a curious reversal for macho Mexico . More traditionally , an underemployed man from a farm area comes to the city , finds a job , then sends for his wife and children . Take short , dark Alfredo Rios Perez , age 25 ( his best estimate ) , from a village in the state of Hidalgo . " I left home maybe six months ago , " he says . Why ? " To better myself ! " As a farm worker he had earned about six dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times that ? enough to bring his wife and three children to the capital . He proudly straightened a mud-spattered hard hat . Or consider the mime I met one morning in the Zocalo . He was wearing wildly checkered trousers and oversize clown shoes and was applying white greasepaint to his face . He lives by laughter and the tips passersby toss into his funny hat . " On a good day here I may get 1,500 pesos , " he told me ? the sum was then close to ten U. S. dollars . " And the same if I am hired for a party . " " I NEVER EARNED that much on the street , " Mario Moreno told me . Don Mario is better known worldwide as Cantinflas , the wistful little comic in dozens of motion pictures during the past half century . " I was born here in the city , in Santa Maria la Redonda , a humble place . It was a struggle to rise . " At the start I was a street actor , working in tent shows . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me what they wanted . That human contact was the basis for my profession . Tips are good-hearted gifts . When the actor makes people happy , they try to pay him for their happiness . " Cantinflas has obviously been rewarded @#  | for millions of happy moments . His home ? not far from the lavish four-house compound of former President Jose Lopez Portillo ? is expensively filled with carved ivory , stained glass , animal skins , portraits , and other trophies of a celebrated life . He has won his struggle up from the streets . So has a young farmboy from Oaxaca : lamed Jose Ruiz . " My military service brought me here first , " he explains . " Later my cousin Margarita got a job as a cook in a private home , and she got me a job as the gardener . I then went to driver 's school and became a chauffeur , so I could finish high school at night . And then I took an electricitv course . So now I have worked three years in electric repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to save some money to open my own shop in Oaxaca . Margarita now has her own lunchroom in Netzahualcoyotl . It 's nice . And two of our cousins have come to live with her . " Success . One early morning I drove out the Puebla highway to visit Margarita 's place . Local maps ca n't keep up with the unnamed roads , so I got lost in a place called the Valley of Ayotla . In the chill of dawn workmen for a cinder-block factory were warming their hands at a smudgy bonfire of truck tires . Alongside some new homes a diked ditch steamed with tar-black waters and the overpowering stench of raw sewage . The scene could have been Dante 's city of Dis : " The marsh from which the stinking gases bubble lies all about this capital of sorrow .... " Yet electric wires randomly stitched houses together in a kind of Jacob 's ladder . Most homes had a TV antenna on the roof . " Yes , " said a workman , rubbing his hands for warmth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propane gas . And we buy water by the drum . " The price was 35 cents for 55 gallons . Even so , clotheslines sported pennants of clean laundry , and curtains hung at the windows . Children in neat uniforms were ( gust 1984 Mexico City : An Alarming Giant  | walking to school , and one housewife was feeding table scraps to her flock of chickens . Back roads finally led me to Netzahualcoyotl ( pages 176-8 ) . This community , just across the frontier of the Federal District in the state of Mexico , has an estimated 2.3 million residents and represents one of the world 's fastest growing cities . Netzahualcoyotl is also a mess . I found trash dumped in dusty unpaved streets and garbage used for fill . I passed the Club Bum Bum , a parlor for funerals ( " day and night " ) , a public-housing project of neat brick , and then a cross-street banner proclaiming : Netzahualcoyotl , the City of Change . Yet Margarita 's lunchroom was clean and , as cousin Jose had boasted , nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own house next door , and tables for loyal clients . Compared with subsistence in rural Oaxaca , her place could represent success : It was hers . " Well , of course , these were Oaxacans , " a sophisticated friend observed . " Like Benito Juarez , each Oaxacan comes here and expects to become president of the republic . " SENORA CONSUELO Cervantes Fernandez is a different kind of president . A woman of 76 from the lake land of Michoacan , she leads her neighborhood association in a subdivision with the leftist name Liberacion Proletaria in Delegacion Alvaro Obregon . Dona Consuelo lives in an airy , tiny house , brightened by bougainvillea and ferns . Her neighbors in a 16-block area enjoy the amenities of running water and electricity . Their cottages cling to a steep slope negotiated only by stone steps , but all the houses are painted , planted , and washed . " We used to look like that , " said Dona Consuelo ; she pointed across a ravine where a cataract of garbage litters the precipitous bank . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we had a factory explosion in 1974 , the firemen could not come . Terrible ! " The great change began two years ago when Liberacion neighbors formed a cooperative to rebuild their community . The city government donated materials and advice , and residents volunteered the labor . " Sundays , evenings ? all . We are many people , perhaps 2,000 , for families often have 12 or  | 15 children . Many unmarried mothers . We worked even with the hands of children . " The hardest job was convincing people this was possible . They had no faith in promises . My own son told his friends he thought I was a little crazy . " She rummaged in a cabinet for an album . " Here ? we are working . " Stiff , posed photos showed the progress . " My son took this picture . This was the first truck to use the road . " She sighed , smiling . " Such satisfaction ! Nothing endures except the help we give others . " People from many neighborhoods visit Liberacidn now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Near here families used to live in the hillside caves left from old sand quarries . " Dangerous because of cave-ins ? people were killed , " said Roberto Domenzain Gonzalez , then president of the neighborhood committee for the whole district . He showed me two caves still gaping above us . " Empty now . We have no one now living in caves . In fact , in the past five years we have resolved all our worst problems here . " But problems can return overnight , like the paracaidistas , or parachutists , the squatters who seem to drop from the sky upon any land still vacant . Dishonest brokers organize invasions of unused land ? dumps , street rights-of-way , empty lots whose owners live elsewhere . The brokers find people seeking homesites , then " sell " them lots and orchestrate a mass invasion by @#  | the families in the dark of night . The brokers keep the money , and the squatters keep the land ? if they are lucky . " We had an invasion here about five months ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning . Their shacks appeared in the ravine one morning . Some families remain . " " Little by little we bring services to these communities , " notes Domenzain Gonzalez . " And what an important change it makes . When people live in such lost cities , they are afraid to enter a store that is big and clean . Instead , they go to small , dirty shops where prices can be much higher . But after their own communities have been made decent , people feel different ; then they  | go to the large stores and save money ! " A distinctive pride and flavor characterizes each part of the city . Consider the Tepito area in Colonia Morelos , famous for La Rinconada , its street market of secondhand clothes and smuggled electronic equipment . Here you could once buy pirated perfumes ? or even ransom back your own stolen silver . No more . Police boast that they have forced a social climb from thieves ' market to flea market . Tepito today enjoys greater fame on sports pages as the starting place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 700 members ; it 's a bright , well-vented complex that smells more of varnish than of sweat . By 7 a. m. the place echoes with the activities of coaches and sparring partners , the rhythmic stutter of punching bags . A sign warns : " It is strictly prohibited to spit on the floor or the walls . " Skipping rope , feinting , crouching , jabbing , wiry young men practice the motions that will take them up and out of Tepito to the cavernous Coliseo and fat prize purses . A rangy 19-year-old welterweight named Juan Carlos Alvarado comes from the west , the state of Jalisco . " I 'm staying in a hotel , " he tells me , and he 's a bit awed , though his hotel is located in a seedy neighborhood . " Sure , " his trainer insists , " a bullfighter may make half a million pesos per fight , but a boxing champion can earn 30 times as much . " Juan is not yet so wealthy ; he will get about $230 for his next fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to bring a smile to Juan 's face ? a shy smile , since Juan is also shy some upper teeth . THE NEIGHBORHOOD around Plaza Romita is older and more infamous . There boys kick soccer balls in the street , and loitering men watch visitors with wary curiosity . " Our neighborhood is known as the home of thieves , " laughs Senora Josefina Bayardo , a schoolteacher and longtime resident . " But we are safe here . No one steals in his own neighborhood . " The local priest , Father Alfonso Aresti Liguori ? for 20 years confessor to many and friend of all ? fidgets , then defends his flock . " Once we had 500 crimes here each year , but things are much better now , " he insists . With proud affection he shows visitors around his small colonial church , built in 1530 . He is careful , I notice , to lock the church office before making his rounds . A St. Jude nearby flickers with a constellation of votive candles . Is this not the patron saint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two St. Judes . This St. Jude cured leprosy . He is a symbol for the people . I am not a policeman or a judge . The people have a good spirit . " Hushed parishioners are arriving for Mass with scrubbed , uncomfortable children . The priest views them fondly : " To understand the city , you must study our countryside . People come here from farms , knowing nothing about city life . In five days they 're so miserable we have to give them help . But soon they are doing the hard work of the city . The second generation feels more at home , and the third generation is completely used to the city . " Social workers affirm this gradual assimilation , and they also talk about the " ruralization of the city , " the habit that well-rooted countryfolk have of raising flowers , vegetables , rabbits , and chickens on the roofs of buildings and in small patios . But parts of the 1,500-square-kilometer Federal District still , surprisingly , need no ruralization . Drive south past Xochimilco and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corn , prickly pear , and orchards . Here the air is cleaner and Volcan Iztaccihuatl stands in whitecapped clarity . At the market in Milpa Alta , you can still hear old women speaking Mexicano , or Nahuatl , the Aztec language . " I spoke Mexicano with my grandmother , " said Senora Catalina Davila de Bonilla , " but not so much now . " She and her husband have a butcher shop in the hilltop market in Santa Ana Tlacotenco , but Dona Catalina was more famous in these hills for 38 years as a midwife . She is a clear-eyed , energetic woman with a sunny smile and a success story : " My parents died while I was a child , and my grandmother raised me . She got up at four each day to go to work . When I started school , a pencil and paper cost only a few centavos , but my grandmother could n't afford even that , so she took me out of school after one year . Now I am able only to write my name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always advised my children to go to  | school . I have nine living children ? and four of them are teachers .. . " I became a midwife by necessity , delivering my own babies . I knew the importance because my mother had died in childbirth . Later I had a training course and won a diploma . I used gloves , clamps ? everything sterilized . And all difficult deliveries I sent to the hospital . When the time came for the pregnant woman to give light to her baby , I gave her courage . People had confidence in me . And later the children I delivered called me Grandmother . I have not counted their number . " Her fee for a routine case came to about three dollars . But Iike all midwives here , Dona Catalina was also a trusted adviser on family planning . " I had to use vulgar words when I explained . And if a woman had two or three children and wanted no more , her husband had to sign a paper for permission to tie her tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives if they feel deceived . . . . No , the priests never caused me trouble . " And who helps a couple decide when to have a child and when to wait ? " Often the husband 's mother decides ? and often a pharmacist , or the midwife . " Perhaps 20 percent of the babies born in Mexico City are delivered at home and by midwives like Dona Catalina . " And the trained midwives are unpaid volunteers in our program , " says Dr. Jorge Martinez Manautou , head of familyplanning services for the Mexican Institute of Social Security . " They are natural leaders in the community , so they aid us greatly . Of course , " the doctor adds , " inflation also aids us . " For children are no longer the economic asset in Mexico that they once seemed . Not with the 100 percent inflation of 1982 , nor the still formidable 80 percent in 1983 . The pressure of these prices on family budgets can best be measured at the enormous old market , La Merced . The neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for along these narrow streets and 60 city blocks come truckloads of foodstuffs from all over Mexico ? tons of bananas , for example , and tons of oranges arriving from both coasts daily . Before the Spanish conquest , Aztec canoes unloaded cargo on docks located here , so the tradition is old : La Merced , with 1,800 fruit and vegetable stalls , for years fed the whole city . It also fed some six million rats on the hundreds of tons of refuse the market generated each day . And La Merced has had its share of human refuse : speculators and extortionists called coyotes , drug addicts and pushers , prostitutes , and the drunks who sleep on potato sacks and empty truckbeds . Daylabor porters must rent " devils , " or wheeled dollies , for 200 pesos a day ; the devils ' owner may collect 20 thousand pesos a day . 0NE MIDNIGHT I toured Merced with police in a patrol car and noticed other policemen walking three abreast for security . No wonder . Dark streets were sinister with debris that approximated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was gossip about 37 families who controlled the market gangster style . Banner news headlines one day warned of " Tension : Eviction From La Merced Today . " " Hitting the Underworld of Merced . " No doubt . The 5,000-member union of produce vendors was protesting a forced move south to the vast new market complex at Iztapalapa . Virtually the whole of Merced was ordered to move . But nearly 200 owners of grocery stores were refusing outright to leave . Police were still insisting that it would be a " peaceful eviction . " " No space ! " shouted one angry man . " Expensive ! " said another . Others , mistaking news photographers for police , were pelting their car with splatty tomatoes . The move was postponed . And since portions of the new Iztapalapa center would be completed one by one , the great market move was sure to furnish more headlines . I flew over the Iztapalapa center by helicopter one afternoon and found it the most impressive construction site I had visited since Brasilia . The complex stretched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribed arabesques to handle produce trucks , but just now it was gritty with the dust of construction and worsened by our rotor wash as we landed . " This market will be one of the world 's largest ? it will feed millions of people , " said an administrator . " More than 50,000 people will work here ! And see : Pedestrians can walk everywhere without encountering 165  | trucks . We have even tried to control the rat problem , at a cost of $120,000 a year . " Beyond the smell of wet concrete and the noise of construction , a small steep hill rises over Iztapalapa . It 's called Cerro de la Estrella , " hill of the star , " and on its summit Aztecs performed their New Fire Ceremony once every 52 years . Throughout the empire every old cooking pot was smashed and every fire extinguished . Not until a new fire was started on the chest of a human sacrificial victim could the world be renewed . Perhaps the Iztapalapa market represents a brand-new cooking pot . But where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In simple truth , no one can clearly see the future of Mexico City . For myself , I note two vastly different trends . First , as a friend in fashionable San Angel explained , " We have neighborhoods where people hire their own security guards and put chains across the street at night . With so much unemployment , some people are afraid ? even of the regular police . " On the other hand , there are the neighborhood organizations of unpaid volunteers . I watched them at work one Saturday morning in Colonia Roma ? housewives , lawyers , shopkeepers , students , accountants ? ringing bells and wielding brooms to clean up their streets . They even had a special trash pickup service for old furniture . " We keep the neighborhood much cleaner this way , " said one cheery woman . " And @#  | we get to know the people who live here . " The neighborhoods have coalesced into precinct organizations and even formed a citywide council of neighborhoods ? the closest thing to an elected city government that Mexico City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city officials ? all appointed ? listen carefully to requests the council forwards . The first elected president of the council , Arturo Diaz Alonso , is a young university professor and writer . He frets at length about his city ? the loss of architectural landmarks , the clutter in the streets ? because he loves being a chilango . " Yes , it was easy to be president of the council because I love the city very much . This is a new way for citizens to communicate . We 're changing the rules of the game . " True . And some newspapers even speculate that the city could one day have an elected mayor . OPTIMISM usually pulses through a Mexican parade , and Revolution Day was no exception . Well behind the reviewing stands on the Zocalo , I watched bands and floats assemble one morning on narrow side streets . While mothers adjusted the ruffles on their daughters ' costumes , drummers practiced rhythms with restless sticks , and charros calmed their horses . The neighborhood was old and dingy , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a leather artisan . The place turned out to be a fourth-floor walk-up , well above the parade group on the street . Hallways were fouled with garbage , but curious neighbors directed me to the right apartment . I knocked , and a naked toddler opened the door into a one-room sweatshop . At a sewing machine a woman was stitching a belt ; scraps of leather were everywhere , jumbled with bedclothes , children of all ages , piles of purses , leather vests on hangers , and uneaten food . Some of the children were helping to box the handicrafts . A baby was crying ; a radio blared . And throughout this sweatshop-home a dozen people worked at a hurried pace . This was not the poverty of Calcutta ? nor even of Netzahualcoyotl . No one was starving . But buying my souvenirs , I had n't the heart to follow the old Mexican custom of bargaining ; I paid the asking price and left for the fresh air of the street . The musicians had begun to play , and with strut and style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president deposed in 1911 by that revolution , Porfirio Diaz , is said to have mused on his way to exile , " Nothing ever happens in Mexico ? until it happens . " Will something happen soon ? We can see the placards of striking students and workers . In the Z6calo , demonstrators protest against hunger and arrests . And Cuba 's embassy here is that country 's largest in the New World , the U. S. S. R. 's among its largest . So , how long can we count on a tranquil Mexico ? I trust the insight of poets more than of pundits . Take , again , Octavio Paz . He has noted how " half of Mexico ? poorly clothed , illiterate , and underfed ? has watched the progress of the other half . " But he also has written that " social mobility ... is a decisive factor , a true safety valve , " and " if a rural uprising is to prosper , it is indispensable that it coincide with a profound power crisis in the cities . In Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It may not come at all . I recall a dismal community of shacks at the bottom of a 500-foot ravine . Living there were 87 families , some with as many as 14 children . By stairsteps carved into the clay , I descended their hill in the dry season , marveling that anyone could manage that slope 172 carrying bundles and babies in the rain . Once there , I talked with the residents . " We used to live up there , " Senora Rebeca Gonzalez gestured toward some mountaintop sand quarries , " in those caves . Our only hope was one day to have a place to live . And now we do ! " She smiled with pride at the jerry-built shacks . They stood in neat rows . I had to admit , and each one had a collection of flowers planted in tin cans . " One day , we hope to extend the water pipes and drainage ? perhaps even pave .... " And what was the name of her community ? Senora Gonzalez beamed : " Esperanza ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
