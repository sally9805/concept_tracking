The Presidency <P> All the Reagan juices were flowing when the President sat down a fortnight ago at his ranch to give one of his radio exhortations . When he saw the mike , he was seized by a latent actor 's impulse to perform . And because the topic of the hour was the Polish government 's move to outlaw Solidarity , his molten aversion to Communism bubbled to the surface . To test the sound equipment and his own pipes , he said firmly : " My fellow Americans , yesterday the Polish government , a military dictatorship , a bunch of no-good lousy bums ... " <P> The equipment was working all too well it turned out . The President 's intemperate words were captured on tape , later aired nationally , and almost instantly became an issue . Polish apparatchiks rushed to explore the meaning and implication of " no-good lousy bums . " That is not the language of diplomacy . It is the language of honesty , such a novel commodity on the international exchanges that the White House feigned unhappiness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , Reagan handlers were genuinely concerned about the breach of faith because the next time it might be damaging . " No-good lousy bums " is right out of Wrigley Field and the 1930s , naughty but lovable . Remember Richard Nixon 's tapes and all those four-letter words about out-of-the-way parts and functions of the body ? A caveman lurked down there someplace . <P> Indeed , in our era of carefully crafted images , these electronic inadvertencies and other unmasked asides carried out of the White House by listeners form a valuable body of presidential lore . So often they are flashes of truth in the twilight world of political dialogue . <P> Back in 1944 Franklin Roosevelt created a ruckus when he went into a voting booth at his home in Hyde Park , N.Y. , and ran into some new voting machines . The best-known voice of the century echoed through the curtains : " Damn . " F.D.R. was just that kind of guy . <P> Hindsight suggests that Harry Truman at first had trouble understanding when he was talking privately and when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officers Association in 1949 , Truman got worked up over criticism of his crony , Major General Harry Vaughan , and called Columnist Drew Pearson an " s.o.b . " The White House purged the transcript , but it was too late . Gasped the Chicago Sun-Times : " The dirty phrase used by Mr. Truman has shocked millions who feel that every President becomes a symbol for clean-minded youth . " <P> Just a few months ago , the surreptitiously taped ramblings of Nixon before he went on national television to give up the presidency began circulating among video buffs . They showed the leader of the Western world on the far edge , chattering strangely with television technicians . Had we seen this bit of psychodrama back then , we might have understood the bizarre proceedings better .
