" // " I want to tell you , my wife is one of his chief fans , " Mr. Ward said , his voice taut , his tone exasperated , referring to Mr. Koch . " And she is just - angry , you know , at his remarks . " He said he had not met any blacks and " damn few whites " who support what the Mayor did. // " This is a troubled time in this country , and a troubled time in this state and a troubled time in this city , " Mr. Ward , the Mayor ' s highest-ranking black appointee , told reporters at City Hall . " If what you are saying or doing is leading to divisiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a sign of weakness to recognize that when something goes wrong , however well intentioned , that sometimes you have to admit that . I ' ve had to do it. " // The Mayor was not present to hear the extraordinary remarks by the man he routinely calls his friend , defends from all critics , praises as one of the best Police Commissioners in New York City ' s history and whose appointment the Mayor cites as proof of his sensitivity to members of minority groups . <> <> Koch Repeats His Regret // As Mr. Ward spoke , Mr. Koch was in Washington , where he told political reporters that he had not comprehended the depth of blacks ' emotional ties to Mr. Jackson ' s candidacy . " I ' m sorry that I injured their feelings , " he said , quickly adding that he still believed he was right to criticize Mr. Jackson. // When Mr. Koch , who called Mr. Ward before leaving Washington , returned to New York yesterday , he would not meet with reporters . He did issue a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would look " beyond my style to the substance of what I said , which I believe was fair political criticism.

" He then went on to say there were heightened racial tensions in the city and that it was " easy to be divisive " but " hard to form a consenus . " Then , in an unexpected reference to former President Richard M. Nixon , he said , " That man knew when to say , ' I made a mistake ' and ' I ' m sorry. ' " // " When you take praise , you also know how to take the criticism , " Mr. Ward told the police audience , " and when you ' re right you take the bows , and when you ' re wrong you make the apologies. " // Later , after City Hall reporters heard a tape of the speech , they asked Mr. Ward , who was in the building for a routine meeting , whether he meant that Mr. Koch should apologize for his attacks on Mr. Jackson .

" I don ' t agree with what the Mayor said . He has not asked me . I have not had an opportunity to tell him. // Mr. Ward was out of town at meetings in North Dakota and Colorado most of last week. // " I was not able to get away from this issue and I was as far west as Norfolk , North Dakota . So obviously it ' s a major issue . And I can tell you , black , white and otherwise , out there in the west , no one was happy with what was happening here in New York.

" <> <> ' Enough Is Enough ' // " It ' s not enough to say , ' I ' m bloodied , ' " Mr. Ward said . " Hell , it ' s not a time for more people to get bloodied . If you ' re bloodied , maybe you need Florence Nightingale . You don ' t need somebody else with a bat and a hatchet. " // Of the attacks on Mr. Jackson , Mr. Ward said , " I don ' t know what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politican , so I don ' t know what your obligation is to speak out on these issues . " But he said the result was bad , and added that " this city really can ' t afford what ' s come out of this. " // " Enough is enough , " he said , adding that it was " time to stop. " // Mr. Ward was clearly aware of the impact of his statements .

" // At another point , he said : " If I was carried away in my language and in the repetition of my attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a danger at hand . Anyone who truly knows me realizes it had absolutely nothing to do with race. " // Near the end of the letter , he wrote : " I hope that those who are angry with me will understand and forgive my transgressions as they perceive them and help me to be a better Mayor . Show me when I am wrong , support me when I am right , and understand that I am just another human being seeking the truth. " //
