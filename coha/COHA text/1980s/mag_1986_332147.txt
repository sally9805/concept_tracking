Back in the early 1970s , Navy Communications Watch Officer John Walker took a hard look at his best friend Jerry Whitworth and , as he later testified , sized him up as " a possible recruit in the spying business . " After more than a decade in the Navy , Walker wanted to retire from the service and was searching for someone who could feed him the kind of inside information that he had been selling to his Soviet contacts at monthly fees ranging from less than $2,000 to $4,000 . For three years , said Walker , he spent a great deal of time trying to " subtly explore Whitworth 's attitude toward espionage . " In 1974 , at a bar in San Diego , Walker finally persuaded his buddy , who had recently left his Navy communications job , to re-enlist and supplement his pay by handing over decoding information and top-secret cables .

He hinted instead that their information might be going to a private defense firm , the Mafia or a U.S. ally like Israel . But near the end of their decade-long " business " relationship , Walker testified , Whitworth became edgy , fearful of getting caught by the FBI . " I found myself in the middle of Mr. Whitworth 's wishy-washiness , " Walker recalled on the witness stand . " I could n't see the FBI as any threat at all . " Whitworth 's trepidation , it turned out , was entirely justified . Last spring Walker was arrested by FBI agents . Two weeks later , Whitworth , now 46 , turned himself in . <P> The Walker ring , which the U.S. Government has called the most damaging spy enterprise in 30 years , was exposed by John Walker 's former wife Barbara .

" Do not squander your money , " Walker said his Soviet contacts told him . " Do n't buy a Mercedes . " <P> Defense attorneys have argued that by making Walker its star witness , the prosecution is " using the shark to catch the minnow . " Whitworth 's defense may rest on Walker 's testimony that the master spy never informed his friend that the stolen secrets were destined for the Soviets . In his final testimony , however , Walker said that " common sense " should have told Whitworth just who the buyer was .                 @ @ @ @
