When you contemplate buying an existing house ( as real estate people call a house that has been lived in ) , you risk the possibility of having to make repairs to it within a year or two of moving in . Which is not surprising , because you usually can buy an existing house cheaper than if it were new . You get the advantage of landscaping and other improvements made by the previous owner or owners . And you often can get into an established neighborhood that is unlikely to change much over time . What you don ' t want are major repair costs . One way to avoid them is to have a house inspection made by a professional before you make a final commitment .
