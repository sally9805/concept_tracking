THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ONE of the most surprising features of the martial law that has been declared in Poland is the thoroughness of the blackout of information , both within Poland and between Poland and the outside world . All at once , Poland appears to have been plunged into an earlier century , when news , much of it unreliable , took months to travel from province to province , from country to country . Yet there is a certain appropriateness to this blackout . The Solidarity movement , in its sixteen months of legal existence , was a light  --  a light that shone with the radiance of the aroused will of a people trying to win its independence and liberty  --  and only the most profound darkness could result from its being extinguished , even temporarily . Solidarity was a movement that lived by breathing the openness it created around itself . Jaruzelski 's brilliant insight was that the way to weaken the movement was not so much by attacking it directly as by smothering the openness it lived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly , no one seemed to know anything . Were strikes going on ? Had there been many deaths ? How many and who had been arrested ? Where was Walesa ? What was the Pope doing ? Nobody knew . Solidarity was probably the most nearly perfect instrument for the expression of a people 's will that our times have seen . Being based on the support of millions of people , it was characterized by respect for the opinions and wishes of its individual members and by openness to contributions from others . Having grown out of the daily life of the people , it encouraged and enriched , and also drew its energy from , the life of the people . Its success was a matter not so much of " grass-roots support " ? the most that the political parties of the Western democracies hope for  --  as of that much rarer political miracle the grassroots initiation of policy and action . Though perhaps short-lived , it may have attained the American ideal of being of the people , by the people , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wonder , then , that in order to crush this movement the Communist military junta was obliged to stop the whole Polish nation cold  --  to lock up the nation 's true leaders , to cut off the telephones , to suspend everyone 's freedom of movement , speech , and assembly . The efficiency with which all this was done was a terrifying demonstration of the exceptional vulnerability of modern technological societies to sudden takeovers by regimes willing to employ violence and repression . Someone throws a switch somewhere and the telephones are out ; another switch is thrown and the television screens are blank or all stations are beaming the single image of the new strong man . Meanwhile , the police , not necessarily numbering more than a few thousand , make their midnight arrests , and the soldiers , themselves in fear of each other , take up their positions in the public squares . However , it is one thing to suspend the life of a nation and another to govern that nation over the months and years . Eventually , the telephones must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speak to one another , and the rhythm of daily life must be resumed . If the public is apathetic , a coup is likely to succeed , but if the public is resolute , as it has been in Poland , the resumption of daily life offers the opportunity to speak and act again . It is a sign of the deep fear of the public felt by the junta that while it theoretically wants everyone to get hack to work it has found itself forced in practice to forbid the workers at certain plants to return to the job , as though it recognized that daily life had become its enemy . And in a quite practical sense it is true that the movement led by Solidarity did represent life  --  life 's energy , life 's variety , life 's spontaneity . And in an equally practical sense the junta , as the events of the last several weeks have shown , represents death , and everything that death means : inertia , paralysis , decay , silence . In the coming months , a contest will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can predict its outcome . But in judging one outcome there is no need to wait . In the contest over who is to represent the spirit of the Polish people , the junta has lost , and the Solidarity movement has won . Just to be what it became is already victory . The Morning Watch BEFORE dawn not long ago , we arrived at Comsat 's new Launch Control Center , in Washington , D.C. , flashed an " INTELSAT VF3 " security badge given to us a few days earlier , and slipped in to watch the main event in the life of the largest commercial satellite ever launched . Fred Weber , a hefty , unflappable engineer , who directs the center , gave us the lowdown . Intelsat VF3 ? the spacecraft , or the bird , as a satellite is often referred to by the experts  --  had gone up two nights before in the nose of a two-stage Atlas Centaur rocket . In less than half an hour ( at T plus 1651.4 seconds ) after blast- off , the rocket had delivered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and twenty-three miles to twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy miles above the earth . The satellite had now made five shakedown passes around the earth while scientists at ground stations from Zamengoe , Cameroon , to Carnarvon , Australia , and Tangua , Brazil ( marked by a Chiquita Banana sticker on one engineer 's map ) , worked with Mission Control in Washington to track the spacecraft . At the farthest point of the sixth pass , Mission Control planned the big maneuver : Apogee Motor Firing , or AMF , to kick the satellite thirty miles out and into a round and geosynchronous orbit , keeping it above the Atlantic Ocean . From there , it could serve as the primary relay post for thousands of simultaneous telephone calls and for two color-television broadcasts between continents . According to Mr. Weber , the forty-two seconds of AMF would determine " the whole ball of wax . " If the satellite 's rocket did n't fire at the right angle ( " We 're talking tenths of a degree " ) , the spacecraft could drift off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if the rocket backfired , the satellite would blow up , as one is believed to have done two years ago , and would take with it an investment now worth seventy-seven million four hundred thousand dollars . Intelsat , we learned from a glossy brochure , is a consortium of organizations from more than a hundred countries ( Comsat , representing the United States , is the largest shareholder ) , and it has seven full-time satellites , which carry two-thirds of all " overseas international public telephone calls . " Since 1964 , when Intelsat was formed , the number of circuits ( microwave connections from ground station to satellite to ground station ) for telecommunication in general has grown at a remarkable rate , and satellite aficionados say that capacity and use are n't close to peaking . The profitable climb in satellite use for data processing , telecommunication , and entertainment led Comsat to build its new center in Washington , in order to keep tabs on domestic satellites after they are launched from Cape Canaveral . To track international missions , Comsat leases the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consoles from a visitors ' gallery , the center looked streamlined and efficient , just the way you might expect a Space Age office to look . In a corner , two Hewlitt-PackJANUARY II , 1982 and minicomputers processed five hundred and twelve digital bits of information from the satellite every half second . In reclining chairs designed for marathon vigils , dozens of scientists in jeans and turtlenecks leafed through charts , monitored video screens displaying each bit of information from the satellite , and , through lightweight headsets , exchanged casual , jargon-filled chatter with colleagues in the room and at ground stations around the world . Stray Coke cans and traces of Twinkies , Ritz crackers , and cold-cut sandwiches suggested that the crew had been on duty for a long stretch . Otherwise , the center looked shipshape . Each expert 's station had a nameplate , each headset came in a blue plastic envelope that matched the chairs and consoles , and all eyes darted regularly to the red numbers of a couple of digital wall clocks . One gave Greenwich mean time by day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other ticked off time to AMF , as in " A minus 05:56 and counting . " AMF was scheduled to take place at T plus 58:11 hours-4:41 A.M. at the center . About three minutes ahead of time , Mission Control went through a formal check of satellite systems , and all were go . Scientists at a ground station in Fucino , Italy , who were in direct contact with the spacecraft , listened to the rundown , and then Mission Control gave Fucino ( " Do you read me , Gian Carlo ? " ) the command to turn on the enabling switch of the satellite 's rocket . ( " That 's a fail-safe , " Mr. Weber told us . " You do n't want to fire a nineteen-hundred-pound cannon inadvertently . " ) The engineers around us monitored Channel 10 on their video sets , which was the channel for Fucino , and the image they saw also filled a superscreen on a wall of the center . Labelled " Doppler shift , " the picture showed a vertical stream of graph paper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge barometer waiting for a Bermuda high . In a standard example of the Doppler effect , we recalled , the pitch of a train whistle seems to rise as the train draws near . If the satellite made the jump from transfer orbit to geosynchronous orbit and so drew closer to Fucino , its velocity would seem to increase and the stylus would reflect the Doppler effect . At T plus 58:11 hours , Mr. Weber flipped through a half-dozen channels to check the status of the satellite . Through a headset , we heard the crackling of static and , from the computer room at Mission Control , the report " Solutions are starting to agree . " The stylus moved up the paper in a smooth , diagonal , seventy-seven-million **29;6601;TOOLONG line . We waited for a whoop of relief , but the scientists simply continued to go about their business . Sylvia Marlowe WHEN Sylvia Marlowe , the harpsichordist , died last month , a piece of New York fell away . New York is people like Sylvia Marlowe , in whom passionate work , strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a stretch of the city 's intellectual and social history are combined . It seems unlikely that Sylvia Marlowe , strenuous , combative , enmeshed in hard work and adult relationships , and without children herself , ever took a small child to Macy 's to see Santa Claus , as we did on the day we heard she had died . Yet , because such an expedition is a New York ritual , because Herald Square in the Christmas season  --  the extra excitement of the crowds , the way that taxis look jostling in a thin , brilliant mid-December light  --  is so New Yorkish , it seemed both incredible that this was going on without her and comforting that it was . Similarly , it might seem incredible that Konstantin Levin 's estate , the very medium of his ideas and his character , existed after he had died , while at the same time the land would retain a feeling of his presence . The real terrain of a city ' like New York , however , is the insubstantial creation of the people in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a stretch of countryside . In this case , though a mood remained , a part of the topography was actually gone . Sylvia Marlowe 's terrain took shape toward the end of the Second World War , although the primary elements were in place before that . She had grown up in Brooklyn , and knew many members of what is now called the Old Partisan Review Crowd from there , with whom she shared a passion for literature , painting , and politics ; from the start she had ranged actively beyond her own field , breaking away from the excluding absorption in music which often isolates musical people . She had also ranged far beyond Brooklyn : she had studied with Nadia Boulanger and Wanda Landowska in Paris and had become a cosmopolitan person , at home in international artistic and social circles . The flavor of Brooklyn , however , remained a constant in her personality , and it meshed with refinement in an unexpected , dynamic way . She was , certainly , an elegant woman  --  fine-looking , chic , and innately graceful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  unpretentious , to put it mildly as though she were say-ing , " My elegance is my own , make no mistake about who I am . " This elemental quality could be startling if one had built up an image from record covers such as the one showing a dreamy princesslike figure playing a harpsichord in a field of flowers and apparently about to faint from sensitivity . By the end of the war , Sylvia Marlowe had also established herself professionally . With Ralph Kirkpatrick , another student of Landowska 's , she had brought the harpsichord to America and , with it , a forgotten period of music . The focus at that time was on nineteenth-century German Romantic music , whereas the repertoire of the harpsichord was the rational , emotionally disciplined music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , much of it French . Furthermore , she was musicologically erudite  --  an unusual bent for a performer at that time . This combination of an intellectual attitude toward music and the introduction of a period of music that was itself cerebral by a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  writers , painters , and intellectuals  --  were attracted to her . Another was her contemporariness . She was equally interested in modern music , and throughout her career commissioned contemporary ' composers  --  among them Elliott Carter , Ben Weber , Vittorio Rieti , Henri Sauguet , John Lessard , Virgil Thomson , Alexei Haieff , Alan Hovhaness , and Ned Rorern  --  to write pieces for the harpsichord . There was nothing whatever about Sylvia Marlowe that suggested an escape into the past . She brought to everything she touched an energetic actuality : whether she was discussing Henry James or Middle Eastern politics , whether she was playing Bach or Carter , the feeling she communicated was that this is vital now . In 1948 she married Leonid Berman , the son of a Russian hanker and himself a neoromantic painter , who was already famous in Europe , and who brought to the marriage his own extensive friendship among Russian emigres and European artists . Leonid Berman combined a turn-of-the-century suavity with a shrugging , down-to-earth unexcitableness . Where Sylvia Marlowe 's elemental quality was militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  almost disastrously high-strung . He was always supremely unhurried , always exactly the same . To be with the two of them was like riding a bucking bronco and gliding in a canoe at the same time . The success of this marriage between two such different and seemingly incompatible people provoked a tender amusement among their friends . The depth of the union , however , was not fully understood until Berman died , in 1976 ; then Sylvia Marlowe went into a decline , and though she fought it with a scrappy , stubborn fury , she was unable to reverse it . By the late forties , Sylvia Marlowe and Leonid Berman were living in their apartment on East Sixtieth Street , where both lived out their lives . The high main room was furnished sparsely with two Victorian sofas , a few chairs , a low marble table , and a small wooden table in a corner which served as a bar . The walls , in contrast , were covered with paintings almost from top to bottom . Many of them were Berman 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kind of light in which the horizon blurs into the sky and small details are caught in an unearthly brightness . While Sylvia Marlowe read widely and voraciously , Berman once mentioned that he was reading " Madame Bovary " for the sixteenth time and saw no point in reading any other book . In a sense , he also painted the same painting over and over , and achieved a similar depth of perfection . There were other paintings in the room , however  --  almost all modern , many by painters who gathered there . The paintings made it a very lively room , yet it was one with plenty of space  --  an excellent one for parties . Sylvia Marlowe gave excellent parties . Among the people who gathered there regularly were W. H. Auden , Virgil Thomson , Pavel Tchelitchew , Clement Greenberg , Harold Rosenberg , Lionel Trilling , Aaron Copland , Alfred Kazin , Max Ernst , Mary McCarthy , Edmund Wilson , and Marcel Duchamp . " New York was a cozy , bubbly place after the war , " says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more fighting over political matters  --  among the Trotskyites or whatever  --  than there is now , but it was also cozy . Everyone knew everyone . Many artists and writers from Europe had come here . It was jumping . Kirk Askew , of the Durlacher Gallery , which represented Leonid , had the famous salon , but that was very chichi . Sylvia was an Askew favorite , but she also created her own salon  --  a more informal one  --  where a great mixture of bright people would gather , and some from the chichi world , too , who would go just because it was interesting there . Every party was marked by lightness , hospitality , and gaiety . Every party was a success . " While a litany of names captures the liveliness and the feeling of intelligence and strong personality that characterized Sylvia Marlowe 's parties  --  and she continued to entertain , just as she continued to work , until that last decline caught up with her  --  it is misleading in that it suggests awesome , self-consciously high-toned gatherings . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood at those parties is that as time went on and new faces were added , these included the children of some of the original friends , and though the young people had no fame or accomplishment with which to advertise themselves , they felt completely comfortable , free to mix and free to speak there . Prima donnas were not an unknown species in that room , but they never set the tone , and the reason for this was the superior force of Sylvia Marlowe 's tone  --  of unpretentious intelligence , of grappling with life in a way that left no room for affectation and plenty for its deadly enemy , a robust and caustic wit . ( Leonid Berman 's air of being supremely unimpressed helped . At one illustrious gathering , he was found in the back room reading " Madame Bovary . " ) Sylvia Marlowe was a serious person : not solemn , far from humorless , certainly not pious , but serious  --  serious in the refreshing way that emergencies can elicit , when out of necessity poses must be dropped and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when risks can not be avoided and therefore the highest possible standard of judgment is not competitive or snobbish but something upon which life itself depends . It was seriousness devoid of seriosity . It was the kind of seriousness that , without being the least hit naive about the foolishness of human beings or the character of life as a fool 's errand , nevertheless believes passionately that life matters . Such courage and the dangerous laughter native to it can he hard on others , whose commitment to life may be more ambivalent . Friendship with Sylvia Marlowe was sometimes rough going . And yet it was just this rough-going seriousness that enabled her to combine in enduring friendship with so many people , for contact on that level is one of the most enlivening , indispensable forms of contact there are . In summing up Sylvia Marlowe 's career , her colleagues mention several facets : " She maintained a high level of excellence and musicality , without pretense , not pushing through merde , never crappy corn . " " Her registration  --  the organization and distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She did for the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries what Callas did for Donizetti and Bellini . " " By playing with her , performers learned Baroque ornamentation and rhythm patterns discovered through musicology and conveyed it to other performers . " And then this : " Her greatest importance was her influence as a person on musicians and composers . She was frank , outspoken , and aesthetically intelligent . Many performers pussyfoot when they are talking to a composer about his piece . The minute she had an opinion , she spouted it . She was active . You had to cope with her . " Active is the word : active with others and active with herself as well . Behind the success was a willingness to struggle , which to those who knew her was in itself a testament . Life in general was not easy for Sylvia Marlowe , and least of all the central endeavor of her life , performing . In thinking back over her career , we kept remembering the private side , the acute nervousness that she suffered onstage  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of lapses from nervousness " Come now , Mr. Hillman  --  everybody ca n't have a hany ending . " which dogged her . Even the impeccable performances preserved on recordings were torture for her . We thought of this as well as of the outward success not only because struggle was so much a part of her but because struggle with fallibility is what kept her free of slickness , disdain , and smugness . It 's what kept the seriousness open and actual , making her the sort of person with whom one had to cope  --  which is to say , with whom one had to be active in a way similar to her own . We thought of it also because one of the most striking features of her playing is the sense of a powerful personality making full emotional and intellectual contact with the music , and it seems unlikely that such contact could come about without struggle . Like her life , her music is a testament to a way of being , and , on looking hack , one feels that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we will miss most , especially whenever we happen to walk along Sixtieth Street between Lexington and Park . The sense of loss will come as a surprise , just as , when Sylvia Marlowe was alive , it was always a surprise to realize that she was right there , in the heart of midtown , in the shadow of Bloomingdale 's , of all things , where the sidewalks are too narrow for the crowds , and the crammed-in hubbub is as harassing and stressful as it is anywhere in the city . Remembering , one could call her from a phone on the corner  --  if it was toward evening , when she stopped work  --  and go up for a visit : if , that is , one felt strong enough for her critique of one 's dubious purchases at Bloomingdale 's , strong enough to cope with her on other levels . Now the apartment is empty . Someone else will soon be there , probably someone who knows nothing of Sylvia Marlowe , or what took place there , and so as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more be there than if it had been torn down . All that we will have is a recollection of a terrain and a memory of the testament that created it . But , thrust back on the city by her absence , we might see that the serious , spirited , willing struggle of people with life is what makes the city real ; that without this it is a useless , ephemeral place , consisting mainly of glitter and dirt . We might get on the subway to ride home with more gumption than usual , with more happiness at being here than usual . And on the way we might remember that we also have something else . When we got home , we could play one of Sylvia Marlowe 's records . We might pick the Goldberg Variations , for example , and hear in those grave opening phrases , with the strange , retroactive awareness that arises in the face of death , that she was playing for herself . Then that she was playing for us all . And then that life indeed depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My phone was disconnected , " said a voice that sounded like Janet 's . " I 'm in a pay phone down the street with one shoe on . My broken toe is freezing . Call me back on my phone in five minutes . 1 can only receive calls . " We promised . " I 've taken some notes , " Janet said when we called back , " and I wanted to talk to somebody before I forget what they mean . " We listened . " I 'm glad you called , " she went
