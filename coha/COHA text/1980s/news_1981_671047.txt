The foreign agents registration lists at the Justice Department show just about everyone who is anyone in foreign consultancy , and shed some light on the competitive , even cut-throat world of those who sell to foreigners their knowledge of this Government and ways to influence it. // Drawn chiefly from the ranks of former Government officials , the lobbyists are required to report not only for whom they are working but how much they earn under the Foreign Agents Registration Act , which dates back to 1938 when Congress sensed a menace from rising German propaganda activities in this country and tried to do something about it. // " It ' s basically a disclosure statute with a civil injunctive remedy , " says Joseph E. Clarkson , chief of the enforcement section of six lawyers , one staff investigator , three paralegal aides , three auditors and five secretaries. // // The Billy Carter Case // The Justice Department has filed 15 civil suits since 1975 to force disclosure from the more bashful consultants . Perhaps the shyest was Billy Carter , the younger brother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbyist for the Libyan Government after the Justice Department filed an action against him last year. // In Room 100 at 315 Ninth Street , N.W. , across the street from the Federal Bureau of Investigation building in downtown Washington , the files of the former President ' s brother and more than 650 other practitioners of the art of consultancy are available for perusal by the public from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. weekdays. // William A. ( Billy ) Carter of P.O. Box 234 , Buena Vista , Ga. 31803 , as his statement reads , received a total of $220 , 000 in addition to gifts and free travel for engaging in , among other things , discussing Libyan oil allocations , planning for a visit here by a Libyan delegation , and organizing the Libyan-Arab Friendship Association. // One-fifth of all the registrants currently on the books are working for the Japanese , a sign of the huge trade flow and other economic ties between the United States and Japan and the desire of the Japanese to maintain a friendly base in Washington . <> <> Fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the files for the public in the blue-carpeted reading room and who even provides photocopies at 10 cents a page , accepted a reporter ' s request for documents on William D. Eberle , a former United States trade representative. // He , it turns out , has been advising Nissan , the No. 2 Japanese automobile maker , on American trade policy since 1979 and in the latest six-month reporting period received $131 , 000 in fees from the Tokyo headquarters of the company. // Richard V. Allen , who is on leave from the White House as national security adviser , also provided services for Nissan as well as for Toyota , the No. 1 Japanese automobile maker . He has not filed , however , because of an exclusion in the law that exempts those who work for American subsidiaries of foreign companies. // Technically , the statute requires registration by those who are agents for such " foreign principals " as foreign governments , foreign corporations or foreign political parties . The so-called multinational exclusion exempts those who are paid by the domestic subsidiary , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simply organized as a lobbying unit , according to Mr. Clarkson , the Justice section chief . <> <> Consultancy Concern Is Growing // Each month the office prepares a public list of the new filings . These show some of the activities of one of the fastest-growing Washington consultancy and public relations firms , Gray and Company , owned by Robert K. Gray , a former executive of the Hill &; Knowlton public relations firm , who had been co-chairman of President Reagan ' s inauguration committee. // Among those recruited by Mr. Gray are Bette B. Anderson , former Treasurer of the United States , and Gary Hymel , a former aide to Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr . , Democrat of Massachusetts. // Mr. Hymel , according to the registration statement , recently accompanied the deputy chairman of Kuwait Petroleum Company , Dr. Abdul Razzak Mohammed Mulla Hussain , at a meeting with Representative Benjamin S. Rosenthal , Democrat of Queens. // Dr. Hussain had been called to testify before Representative Rosenthal ' s Government Operations subcommittee on the nowconsummated acquisition by state-owned Kuwait Petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern with expertise as well in nuclear energy . The committee had been highly critical of the purchase . <> <> The Pay Is Good // Such well-wired representation pays well . The Gray firm was paid $10 , 000 to prepare Dr. Hussain for the Oct. 22 hearing before the Rosenthal panel and to deal with media queries . Mr. Hymel , Mrs. Anderson and Mr. Gray , according to the registration statement , " critiqued a videtape " of Dr. Hussain presenting his statement and anticipated potential questions from members of the House panel. // Another newcomer to the foreign lobby lists is Anne Wexler , a senior assistant to President Carter , who worked for Foothills Pipe Lines ( Yukon ) Ltd. , seeking to obtain passage by Congress of waivers to legislation that would facilitate private financing of the huge Alaska natural gas pipeline project. // Wexler &; Associates , according to the filing , received $10 , 000 with the promise of an additional $10 , 000 if the waiver bill passed , as it did. // Mary Williams , who carts out the files for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ' t get too much business from the general public . Her steady customers include journalists , lawyers , officials from other Government agencies , Congressional staff members , students - and of course , the competition. //
