Fighting intensifies , and the Marines suffer their first combat casualties <P> For two hours , the mortars , shells and rockets crashed down on the lightly reinforced encampment around the runways at Beirut International Airport . Crouched in their bunkers , the 1,200 U.S. Marines who form part of a four-nation , 5,400-man peace-keeping force could do little more than keep their heads low and occasionally fire back . " We could hear bullets whizzing above us , and others were impacting on our sand bags , " Sergeant Donald Williams , 28 , later recalled . Whenever they saw a muzzle flash or some other indication of where the large rounds were coming from , the Marines retaliated with their rifles and machine guns , and finally resorted to their 155-mm cannons and missile-armed Cobra helicopters . At about 9:45 a.m. , the first of two 82-mm mortar shells came cascading into the command tent where Staff Sergeant Alexander M. Ortega , 25 , was getting batteries for radios . Just outside the tent , Second Lieut . Donald G. Losey Jr. , 28 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Both men were hit by shrapnel and died shortly thereafter . Fourteen other Marines were wounded before the fighting finally subsided . <P> The Marines were the victims of the worst outbreak of factional fighting since the Israeli invasion last summer . Although there could be no doubt that Druze and Shi'ite militiamen in the hills and shantytowns near the airport had deliberately targeted the U.S. troops , stray rounds also made their way into the compound . Uneasy about the security of the Marine contingent in Lebanon , the U.S. last week ordered an additional 2,000 Marines from East Africa to the eastern Mediterranean , making them available for service in Lebanon if they should be needed . <P> Almost before anyone realized it , a minor incident had exploded into an all-out fight between the Lebanese army and the Shi'ite Amal militia . When the army moved into Amal strongholds in Beirut 's southern suburbs , masked gunmen representing several Muslim factions took control of their neighborhoods in West Beirut , sending civilians scurrying to the safety of their homes . Armed with rocket-propelled grenades , AK-47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardposts , barracks and convoys . In response , the Lebanese army dispatched 10,000 troops , backed up by tanks and armored personnel carriers , to regain control of the city . Supported by tank rounds and heavy machine-gun fire , infantrymen crept up alleys and side streets in search of the militiamen . <P> Contrary to the expectations of many , the untested army , which had remained largely out of sight since the outbreak of the 1975-76 civil war , successfully reasserted the government 's authority . But it was not clear how long the calm would last . At week 's end , the Lebanese Cabinet ordered an investigation of reports that as many as 40 Christian civilians were massacred by Druze militiamen last Thursday in the mountain village of Bmariam.
