When Texas state inspectors set up checkpoints last week along two major highways leading into the state , they were not worried about escaped convicts or gunrunners . They were on the lookout for fugitives from Florida : oranges , grapefruit and other citrus . The roadblocks were the latest development in a tart tussle among citrus-growing states that began earlier this month , when the U.S. Department of Agriculture lifted a ban on shipments of the fresh Florida fruit to Arizona , California and Texas , among other citrus-producing areas . <P> The temporary ban was imposed in 1984 to halt an epidemic of canker , a deadly plant disease . In response to the end of the ban , Texas declared a 30- day embargo on Florida imports to allow time to make a case that canker remains a threat . Florida growers , who sold $25 million worth of citrus in the banned states in the 1983-84 season , aim to challenge the Texas embargo in court .                  @ @ @
