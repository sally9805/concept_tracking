" I believe in the theater , " said the new Baron of Brighton in his maiden speech to the House of Lords in 1971 . " I believe in it as the first glamourizer of thought . " That was the theater to Laurence Olivier , and that was Olivier to all who fell under the glamorous spell he wove . More immediately and lastingly than any other modern actor , Olivier picked words off the playscript page , flung them passionately into the dark and secured them in the minds of theatergoers . Brilliance , for once , had its rewards . As critic Kenneth Tynan proclaimed in 1966 , " Laurence Olivier at his best is what everyone has always meant by the phrase ' a great actor . ' " Director , producer , prime mover of Britain 's National Theater , embodier of the most vital Shakespearean heroes , Olivier at his death last week at 82 held undisputed claim to yet another title : the 20th century 's definitive man of the theater . <P> Like the century he almost spanned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his genius and his folly fed each other spectacularly . Said Albert Finney , who in 1959 understudied Olivier as Coriolanus : " He makes the climaxes higher , and he makes the depths of it lower , than you feel is possible in the text . " <P> So too with the text and texture of Olivier 's life and career . He was the son of a fifth-generation Anglican clergyman , yet he found his soul upon the wicked stage . The foremost classical actor of his time , he attained his first eminence as a West End matinee idol , and his second as a Hollywood dreamboat in Wuthering Heights ( 1939 ) and Rebecca ( 1940 ) . Though he pored over scripts like a new critical scholar , he was an irrepressibly physical stage performer , scaling balconies and executing dizzying falls with Fairbanksian elan . Like many men , Olivier housed a congeries of contradictions ; uniquely , he transformed them into living art . <P> At the apex of his stage career  --  in the mid- ' 40s , when he and Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London and New York City  --  Olivier could spread out the banquet of those contradictions in a single evening . In Henry IV , Part I , he was the stuttering , heroic Hotspur ; in Part II , the cagey-senile Justice Shallow . The curtain would fall on his Oedipus , with its searing scream of self-revelation ; after intermission he would mince on as Mr. Puff , the giddy paragraphist of Sheridan 's The Critic . It was all part of a 70-year striptease in which this consummate quick-change artist always had one more veil to remove , and proof of what director Peter Glenville called Olivier 's " greed for achievement .
