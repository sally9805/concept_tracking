When Malkiat Singh Sidhu arrived in Canada from India to attend a family wedding , it never occurred to him to ask for police protection . " There was no worry , " a relative explained . " We were celebrating a wedding . It was a time for rejoicing . " But as Sidhu drove along an isolated logging road on Vancouver Island last week , he was shot and badly wounded by four men in another vehicle . Police , who later arrested four Canadian Sikhs , were treating the case as an international incident . The reason : Sidhu , 56 , is the planning minister of the Indian state of Punjab and a party member of the moderate Akali Dal , which is trying to root out Sikh terrorism . <P> India asked Canada to make a full investigation , but it need hardly have bothered .
