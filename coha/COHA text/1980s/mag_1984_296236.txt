The Presidency <P> Ronald Reagan studied the man in front of him and decided Andrei Gromyko was old , far older in some ways than he looked , older than his 75 years . And more important , Gromyko was talking for a group back in the Kremlin that was even more ancient , and perhaps frozen , in their distrust and loathing of the U.S. <P> The aging men of the Politburo may have seen Reagan , robust both physically and politically right now , as some kind of threat . Reagan listened and watched Gromyko as he had rarely scrutinized a man before ; looking for clues from words , from eyes , from a touch or handclasp . <P> Almost from the start of their talk , one signal came through to Reagan loud and clear . It was that Gromyko had no signal to send at all . No message in his eyes . No meaning in his grip . No words that held promise for any kind of agreement . Gromyko 's presence in the White House was the only hint that Soviet-U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seismograph inserted into the very heart of America 's Government , absorbing all the tremors but sending absolutely nothing back . Gromyko talked , but what Reagan heard was right out of the briefing book , a recitation of prejudices , perceived insults and the history of the world acl cording to the U.S.S.R. <P> Reagan waited nearly four hours for a nicker of flexibility , any tiny gesture of accommodation . None came . Once Gromyko was recalling how it was back in 1946 . <P> The Soviet Union had wanted to ban all atomic weapons , and the U.S. had refused . Right , answered Reagan ; that was when the Soviets did not have the bomb . But when Bernard Baruch proposed an international tribunal to govern nuclear weapons , it was the Soviets who balked . <P> Reagan concluded that Gromyko could not talk or act on his own in any way . <P> He had to go back to the Kremlin for orders . And what is the view back there ? Reagan was as baffled as ever . There is no " there " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how authority is exercised . Reagan 's frustration increased a bit . He wondered fleetingly if the Kremlin was like an old-age home . <P> But maybe , Reagan thought , they do have problems that nobody here can imagine . Maybe , Reagan told Gromyko , there were reasons for the Soviets to distrust and fear the U.S. , though this country had never proclaimed its desire to export its system around the globe . The fact was , said Reagan , the superpowers now just had to set aside all their accumulated suspicions and prevent nuclear war . <P> Still nothing from Gromyko . No thaw . No acknowledgment of shared humanity . Gromyko plainly could say nothing , and he did it very well . <P> Reagan had been initiated into the club . In 1961 John Kennedy encountered the same cold void when he talked to Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna . " I never met a man like that before , " marveled Kennedy when he got back home .                @ @ @ @ @
