Early on , with Iowa and Illinois , and then later , with Michigan and Ohio , the Midwest weighs heavily in the party nomination outcome . Two of the most pivotal states for the November general election  --  Ohio and Illinois  --  lie in the heartland. // But the political mood in the Midwest is tentative and wary . The public is bidding its time , watching events in other states , in no hurry to make up its collective mind about candidates. // There is no mistaking the Midwest ' s importance for 1980. // The nomination process that began in Iowa Jan. 21  --  moving to New England as March began and to the South this past week  --  now returns to the heartland with the Illinois primary March 18. // Thereafter , in almost every week from Illinois until the Ohio primary June 3 , the last day of the delegate season , the Midwest will register with a caucus or primary. // The East ' s nomination influence is mostly " up front "  --  three-fourths of its delegates will have been chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its closing power  --  three-fourths of the delegates there will still not have been chosen by the end of April . But the Midwest ' s delegates  --  the largest share of any region ( with 28 percent of both convention ' s totals )  --  are chosen more evenly over the five-month nomination calendar. // So far , Midwesterners seem relieved that their nomination decisions won ' t be over in a rush. // Midwesterners  --  whether they be farmers , industrial workers , or business people  --  are troubled . Inflation worries them . The nation seems adrift as a world power , lacking a moral or conceptual mooring for influencing events , they say . And while Midwesterners generally hold no single leader or institution responsible , including President Carter and Congress , neither does any candidate inspire a majority of them to great hope. // First George Bush , as a result of his caucus showing in Iowa , and now John Anderson , among the Republicans , have stirred those anxious for a fresh face . But already , here in the Midwest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , new Republican moderates and make the 1980 race into a rerun of Mr. Ford ' s 1976 struggle with conservative Ronald Reagan. // The economy cuts hardest among 1980 issues. // " If I weren ' t a Christian man , I ' d despair , " says Bill Fordham , a farmer from a town with the unlikely name of Ohio , Ill. , who takes scientific soil heat and moisture readings for the government in his spare time . " The cost of money now is over 16 percent . A year ago it was 10 . We ' re going to be borrowing $250 , 000 for operating expenses this spring . Higher rates will take $15 , 000 out of my profits this year. " // My circle of acquaintances is such that we don ' t talk politics much , " Mr. Fordham says . " Personally i ' m kind of excited about John Anderson ' s chances . " The liberal Republican congressman , who finished a strong second to George Bush in the Massachusetts primary , is from a neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 700 acres of corn and soybeans , isn ' t angry with President Carter over the grain embargo . " The grain embargo , as such hasn ' t really hurt cash market prices of today , " Mr. Fordham says. " i ' m not opposed to an embargo . But the boycott burden shouldn ' t be put on one part of the economy. " // In Michigan , too , economic trends test the Midwesterner ' s usually determined optimism. // " It ' s bleak now , " says Michael Cherry , service manager for a Detroit marine-engine manufacturer . " Dealers . . . can ' t afford to keep an inventory of boats to show people . At 18 percent , you have to sell a boat after you get it . And fuel is so high . It costs a boat owner $150 a weekend for fuel . Another 50-cent hike in the price of gasoline could be the end of the V-8 marine engine. " // " We ' re in a non-hero situation , " says Toledo , Ohio , food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ' s going to hurt us the least , not help us the most. " // " I don ' t think the country is in all that bad shape , compared with50 years ago , or 20 years ago , " Mr. Penner says . " But there are so many problems that just sit there , so many unwinnable battles  --  like the hostages . There ' s nothing anyone can do about energy costs. // " I have mixed feelings about all the candidates . There ' s not a clear leader in the bunch . Carter ' s letting the Shah in was a calculated risk , and he lost . His lethargic handling of the thing is perceived as a success. // " Anderson ' s far too liberal for my taste . Reagan goes too far the other way . And who ' s Bush ? What has he ever done ? Nobody in Toledo knows anything about George Bush. // " I ' m going to sit on the fence until the last couple of weeks. " // In Grand Rapids , Mich. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the White House , Robert Durham says he ' s " a Bush man " but his first choices  --  former US Secetary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and former Secretary of the Treasury William Simon  --  aren ' t running. // " It ' s hard to pin Bush down , " Mr. Durham concedes. " i ' d like to hear more about his economic policies . He comes through clean , though  --  and clean looks good. " // " We think of Jerry with fondness , " Mr. Durham says of the former president . " But he ' d get shot down if he became a serious candidate . The newspapers would bring up his banging his head , the pardon of Nixon. " // " Reagan , philosophically , has a great deal of appeal , " // Mr. Durham continues . " But he ' s an ideologue , not a pragmatist . He ' s a media event. // " Carter is milking the Iranian situation , holding 200 million people electorally hostage to himself. he ' s using it as a ploy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . favors wage and price controls . But they ' ve never worked . They have appeal to a great many people , but they only create greater inflation. " // In practical terms , too , Midwesterners are waiting  --  for the campaign to arrive. // Pins , posters , campaign headquarters can be readied in advance . But , like a road show , not until the candidates appear after the previous nomination theatre , does a state come alive to the contest. // The motorcades , the speeches amplified on TV news have just hit Illinois as Edward Kennedy and John Anderson skipped the Southern primaries . Mr. Anderson won top billing as " star of the week " in the Chicago Sun- Times , before Mr. Reagan and Rep. Philip Crane arrived from the Southern campaign  --  also to claim the homestate advantage. // On the Democratic side in the Prairie State , most of the action appeared to be going on in the dark labyrinth of corridors beneath Chicago City Hall. // Surface events showed Rosalynn Carter speaking at the Devon-Sheridan Senior Community Center here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iran and Afghanistan crises . . . or Senator Kennedy telling the City Club of Chicago at a crowded luncheon about the " myths of Carter economic politics. " // But the Democratic outcome , long-time Chicago-watchers say , may really depend on the will and determination of Mayor Jane Byrne and the patronage forces she commands in City Hall and Cook County administration buildings. // Is she really the heir of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley , who could turn out an army Cook County patronage workers 40 , 000 strong ? // Will she be a 1980 Kennedy kingmaker , the way Mr. Daley reputedly was in the tight 1960 general election for the senator ' s older brother John ? // " Will Jane ' lay numbers on ' the precinct captains ? " one insider asks . That is , will she give Democratic ward and precinct leaders quotas to meet , under the implied threat of cutting jobs under their control if they fail to produce ? // Mrs. Byrne already has become a controversial figure here in her own right . First a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dominated daily headlines and newscasts . Her confrontations with municipal workers plus the drama of the Iranian and Afghan affairs and economic news have blocked attention to the campaign of her candidate , Ted Kennedy. // The net effect of Mrs. Byrne ' s help for Senator Kennedy and the clout of the Cook County Democratic machine she inherited will be measured in the Illinois primary , as well as in the delegate outcome. // Most polls show Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan the favorites in Illinois  --  but with many voters ready to switch in the closing days . The Illinois system , a delegate-slate ballot by congressional district , may confuse outsiders . In the crucial delegate-slate listings , the senator and President Carter are rated about even. // After Illinois it ' s on to Wisconsin and Kansas April 1. // In Wisconsin , Kennedy forces concede the edge to President Carter . But John Anderson seems to be generating the most excitement overall . The Madison Capital Times endorsed Mr. Anderson for President  --  the first Republican it has backed since its founding in 1917. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country to endorse Eugene McCarthy , " points out editor Elliot Mariniss. // " The paper has been tremendously disappointed with Jimmy Carter , " he says . " Right now he ' s the favorite over Kennedy . We never know where Carter ' s going with foreign policy . We supported him on Iran . But there doesn ' t seem to be any consistency in his administration. " // Mr. Anderson , not Senator Kennedy , appears to be the likely heir to Wisconsin voters ' dissatisfaction with the President. // " Reagan will win the primary , " Mr. Mariness says . " He appeals to deep-rooted Wisconsin conservatism. " // But Wisconsin ' s large group of independents  --  mostly disillusioned moderate Republicans at odds with conservative party leadership  --  will likely go for Representative Anderson. // " Anderson will churn things up here , " Mr. Mariness says , likening the candidate ' s situation to the 1924 Robert M. La Follette third-party movement in Wisconsin. // In Wisconsin , as is the case nationally , political observers are waiting to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a political reporter for the University of Wisconsin campus paper , the Daily Cardinal , says : " There ' s surprisingly little interest among students in the presidential race so far . Brown , Anderson , and Kennedy people all say they have great support among the students . There just isn ' t the interest there was in 1972 or 1968 . We ' ve had mostly surrogates , not the candidates , appearing here . Students aren ' t well-organized yet into mass committees going out to work for the candidates. // " If anything has caused a stir , it ' s the draft . There have been demonstrations . But the crowds have measured in the hundreds , not in the thousands. // " The students mostly continue grinding away . Getting out and getting the job is the overriding concern. " // In Kansas , which holds its primary the same day as Wisconsin , President Carter looks like the hands-down winner , although Senator Kennedy has strong union support among workers in the state ' s aircraft industry. // Kansans are not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The price of wheat has held up . For a time farmers were worried that the winter wheat crop might have been hurt by the weather , but now prospects look good for another bumper harvest. // Some Kansas Republicans think native son Robert Dole has stayed in the race too long  --  keeping them from lining up behind the party ' s likely survivors . Most of the other Republican activity has sided with Ronald Reagan and George Bush  --  although after his Massachusetts showing John Anderson has made " more headway among rock-ribbed Republicans , " Kansas political observers say. // With Mr. Ford also a possible factor , the Republican race seems as up in the air as a Kansas windstorm. // Nor is the Republican outlook any clearer in neighboring Nebraska , which holds its primary May 13 . But Nebraskans are not stirred up yet about the race . Again , Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush have the organizational lead , with Anderson student forces gathering at the colleges , like the main University of Nebraska campus at Lincoln . " It ' s still quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months to go before the balloting. // Ohio will cash in one-fourth of the 20 percent of convention delegates who will be chosen in the nine primaries scheduled for June 3. // At the moment , Ohioans ' views fairly reflect national trends . Most readings show Senator Kennedy trailing President Carter statewide by the same margin as he trailes nationally  --  with the senator stronger in the state ' s industrial north while Mr. Carter is ahead in the South. // But economic issues are beginning to hit home in Ohio , too . Miners and steelworkers are impatient to get federal approval for the use of high-sulfur coal in power plants . Steel imports are another concern , with the big mills in Youngstown already closed. // President Carter ' s ban on campaigning until the American hostages are released in Iran could hurt him in Ohio. // Mr. Carter narrowly took Ohio 1976 against Gerald Ford , but he has made only two trips to the state since  --  neither of them to Cleveland . President Ford used to visit Ohio every six to eight months , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing since leaving office , without actively being in the race . A poll of 300 Republican precinct committeement earlier this month showed he and Ronald Reagan tied for support , a 29 percent each , with George Bush at 25 percent. // Ford strength rests most securely among Midwestern moderate republican governors. // Ohio ' s James Rhodes was quietly for John Connally , but his support diminished as the Connally star dimmed . Governor Rhodes would like to go with Mr. Ford . But Ohioans see a rough primary battle again if Mr. Ford takes on Mr. Reagan . The former California governor trailed by only eight points in statewide polls in 1976 after campaigning just two days there , although Mr. Ford ended up winning 91 of 97 Ohio delegates. // Closely observed , the Midwest is not a monolithic region. // To an Iowan , Ohio isn ' t even in the Midwest , but in the East . And the lower reaches of Ohio , Indiana , and illinois  --  which were settled up the Ohio River from Kentucky and Tennessee  --  are more Southern than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavily " ethnic " cities of the upper Midwest , from Cleveland to Milwaukee , and the large black blocs in Detroit and St. Louis add other contending factors to the equation. // More than two-thirds of the Midwestern campaign will remain after Illinoisans vote next Tuesday . And the Midwesterners intend to take all the time necessary to make their 1980 decision. // //
