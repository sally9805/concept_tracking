" Florida , Flo-rree-da , " says Heberto Padilla , pronouncing the familiar word with a flourish , as if it were a lover 's name . " Ponce de Leon christened it , and in Coral Gables the streets have Spanish names . So we deserve the place . Whenever we had trouble in Havana , we went to Miami , and Miami is very , very important for us . We do n't feel like immigrants . " Padilla certainly does not . Cuba 's best and most famous poet now talks as if he could be the proud father of all his 726,000 countrymen residing in South Florida . " The U.S. is the seventh-largest Spanish-speaking nation in terms of population , " he says , " and I think that will enrich the country . The present and the future of the U.S. are here . " <P> Padilla , a genial , garrulous man of 53 , first came to the U.S. in the ' 50s to escape the oppression of Fulgencio Batista , the dictator of the day . When Fidel Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself at the command of the new regime , which sent him to London and Moscow as a correspondent for Prensa Latina , the government press agency . Gradually he became disenchanted ; he saw the future of his country in the repressive atmosphere of the East bloc . Poems such as this reflected his unhappy feelings : <P> Cuban poets dream no longer <P> ( not even at night ) . <P> They close the door to write <P> alone <P> Denounced as " counterrevolutionary and pessimistic , " he was eventually jailed , tortured and held for a month in 1971 , an event that inspired a worldwide protest : furious , his old friend Castro visited Padilla 's cell to rail against him . " Abroad they are speaking against the Cuban revolution , " he yelled , " and you are responsible for that . " After his release , Padilla was officially a nonperson for the next decade and eked out a bare living as a translator . Only after Senator Edward Kennedy made a personal appeal to Castro was Padilla allowed to emigrate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious cargo : the manuscript of his second novel , Heroes Are Grazing in My Garden , which was published in English last year ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; $16.95 ) . It is not an angry indictment of Cuba today but something more powerful : a sad but engrossing tale of the spiritual squalor that has settled over the island . Padilla 's memoirs , Self-Portrait of Other  --  the other being the man he left behind in Havana  --  is scheduled to be published next year . <P> Padilla 's three grown children by his first marriage live in Miami , which he visits frequently and where he talked to TIME . But the author and his second wife Belkis , who is also a poet and writer , live in Princeton with their son Ernesto , 13 . " I 've lost time , " he says of the decade between his imprisonment and exile . " I spent ten years fighting and trying to remain alive . " Now he is trying to make up those silent years . In addition to writing poetry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin newspapers , including the Spanish-language section of the Miami Herald . Unlike many other exiles  --  Alexander Solzhenitsyn is his example  --  he does not brood over the past or look wistfully toward the place of his birth . " I do not admire people who suffer professionally . I want to be a new man . I am eager to be alive . My duty is to write . "
