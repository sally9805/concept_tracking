Teamster power rolls on <P> " To all those who say that it is time to reform this organization and that it is time for the officers to quit selling out the members of this organization , I say to them , ' Go to hell ! ' " <P> With those defiant words , issued at his union 's 1976 convention in Las Vegas , Teamster Boss Frank E. Fitzsimmons underscored the brass-knuckles philosophy of union management that ruled supreme during his decade-long tenure as president of the U.S. 's largest trade union . Fitzsimmons ' death last week in La Jolla , Calif , of lung cancer at age 73 makes room at the top of the 78-year-old International Brotherhood of Teamsters ; the succession is not clear . But there seems little prospect that the union will change very much from what it was under the bluff and blustery Fitzsimmons . <P> This week the Teamsters ' 21-member executive board meets in Las Vegas to pick a replacement . The leading candidate is Roy L. Williams , 66 , a protg of Fitzsimmons ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mo. , Williams began driving a truck in 1935 and joined the Teamsters three years later . As a trustee of the Teamsters ' $2.8 billion Central States pension fund , Williams has been probed by federal officials for mismanagement and ties to organized crime . He has been indicted three times on federal embezzlement and records falsification charges , but never convicted . <P> Scandals stud the history of the 2 million-member union , which represents not only some 1 million truckers and warehousemen but also hospital and brewery workers , food industry laborers , police and other municipal employees , and workers in many other occupations . In the 1950s the Teamsters were often linked to labor violence and racketeering , and their president , David Beck , was convicted of embezzlement , larceny and income tax evasion . <P> Beck 's successor , Jimmy Hoffa , remained under almost continual federal investigation by the Justice Department . In 1964 he was convicted and sentenced to a total of 13 years in federal prison for jury tampering , fraud and conspiracy in connection with pension-fund mismanagement . He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Before entering prison , however , Hoffa persuaded delegates to the union 's 1966 convention to elect Fitzsimmons to the newly created post of general vice president , to watch over day-to-day Teamster affairs in the boss 's absence . Fitzsimmons had worked for Hoffa in various union posts since 1934 and was considered little more than a yes man . <P> In 1971 Hoffa was released from Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary after agreeing to resign as president and seek no other union office . Fitzsimmons , who had in the meantime solidified his power within the Teamsters , became president in his own right . Later Hoffa , who suspected Fitzsimmons of engineering the terms of Hoffa 's release for his own ambitions , disavowed the agreement with federal authorities , raising the possibility that he would try to regain the union presidency at the 1976 Teamster convention . He never got the chance : in 1975 Hoffa disappeared , almost certainly murdered , and his body has never been found or the case solved .               @ @ @ @ @ @
