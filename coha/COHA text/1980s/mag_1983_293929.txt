When Advertising Executive and native Bostonian James Ryan , 52 , got the itch to revisit his city 's historic sights , he shrank from the prospect of whizzing past them on a crowded tour bus . Solution : he popped a prerecorded tape into his personal cassette player , consulted a small map that came with the tape , and set off by himself on foot . <P> While the tape used such sound effects as chanting crowds and pealing bells to dramatize pre-Revolutionary War events , a relaxed narrator guided Ryan along Boston 's Freedom Trail , even anticipating his questions about the locations of telephones and restrooms . Ryan rated the tour " first class . " Said he : " It 's fun to have your memory awakened . " <P> Produced by a local firm called the November Co. , " Boston Walkabouts " sell for $10.95 in hotels , airport gift shops and bookstores . Similar guides to five New York City neighborhoods are being offered by Pathfinder Productions . Another New York company , Acoustiguide , produces taped tours of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , designed to be rented for $3 to $7 . <P> Taped tours have become more practical now that cumbersome recorders have been replaced by lightweight personal stereos . Says Pathfinder President Herman Eckrich : " Business has all of a sudden caught fire . "
