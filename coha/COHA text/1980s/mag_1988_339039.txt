" Earn less money . Get responsibility without power . Do boring work . Be blamed for everything . " <P> So runs a satirical ad for a law-school deanship , concocted by New York University Law Professor Stephen Gillers , who , like many another legal scholar , had no interest in the recently vacant dean 's spot at his university . Over the past four years , 125 of the 174 law schools accredited by the American Bar Association , including Chicago , Georgetown and Harvard , have had to search for new deans . Once the capstone of a legal career , the post is now a revolving door , says James P. White , consultant on legal education to the A.B.A. " Twenty years ago , it was not uncommon for a dean to serve 15 or more years , " he says . " Now the average deanship is five years or less . It 's a much more frenetic job . " <P> The pace is just one problem creating " a crisis in law deaning , " says Frederick Anderson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law School after just three years . " There are too many constituencies , " he complains . Students expect the dean to be a sounding board for their concerns . The university administration may balk at requests for funding . Meanwhile , the faculty tends to regard the dean as a peer rather than a supervisor , someone who implements policy but does not make it . <P> Increased administrative pressures also discourage many scholars . As costs of running law schools have soared , deans spend as much as a third of their time fund raising . Compensation is another sore point . While a professor typically earns $65,000 to $90,000 for nine months of service and the average dean receives $90,000 to $150,000 for a year 's work , a star prof at a blue- ribbon school can pull in as much as $200,000 extra in consulting fees . Deans are not only frequently discouraged from moonlighting , they simply have no time for it . <P> Still , the position retains enough prestige so that many scholars are willing to make the sacrifice  --  for a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found his five years in office " very gratifying , " but looks forward to resuming full-time teaching of antitrust law next year . " A deanship takes you away from scholarship , " he says . " These jobs are best done on a one-term basis . " <P> With many scholars reluctant to disrupt their careers for more than a few years , a new brand of dean may be emerging . " Law schools have begun to think about hiring deans whose predominant qualification is administration , " observes American University 's Anderson . Tom Read , the new dean of the University of California 's Hastings College of the Law , exemplifies the trend . Read enjoys " the hurly-burly of the dean 's office , " so much so that his new post is his fourth deanship . " A law-school dean is in some ways more like a football coach than an academician , " he says . " You pull the team together , win as many battles as you can and move on . " <P> Other experts believe short-term or roving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes the dean just an errand boy and caretaker , " objects Erwin Griswold , 84 , who ruled Harvard Law with an iron hand from 1946 to 1967 . " For a dean to get a grasp of an institution and to know the players , it takes a few years , " says the A.B.A. 's White . " I hope the trend will reverse itself . "
