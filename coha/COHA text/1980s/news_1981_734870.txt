txt Chicago Tribune Press Service PHILADELPHIA ? De Paul did n't beat La Salle 69-62 Saturday afternoon . Mark Aguirre did . Period . Perhaps that is n't fair to all the other Blue Demons . After all , Bernard Randolph was sharp again in a reserve role , and Skip Dillard hit his kind of shoteand had 12 points . But without Aguirre 's 35 points , 14 rebounds almost half the team total of 29 , two steals , and assists more De Paul diary , page 6. than the one the stat-watchers allotted him , the Demons would have been an average team . And La Salle , another average team 10-71 , might have pulled off the second upset of De Paul this season . Mark Aguirre The argument against that opinion is that Aguirre 's teammates would feel freer to shoot and move without a dependence on the superstar forward . Assistantcoach Joey Meyer and some of the players advanced that position Saturday in defense of the team . THE DEMONS STAY have a chance to confirm that belief next season , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , there will continue to be games in which the 6-7 junior is a one-man rescue squad . And there will continue to be games in which he ca n't save them ? as was the case in De Paul 's one-point loss to // Aguirre enough to beat LaSalle // Old Dominion Jan. 10 . Saturday , Aguirre scored 23 points in the second half and repeatedly took charge : ? His rebound basket after a Randolph miss was followed by his tip-in , erasing a La Salle lead and puttinrt De Paul ahead 39-35 . ? His two straight field goals gave the Demons their biggest lead at 50-40 . His assist to Terry Cummings held La Salle at bay , and his basket created a 4-point cushion after the Explorers had closed to 53-56. 43 His steal under La Salle 's basket , his defensive rebound that keyed a fast break on which Randolph 's basket made it 67.60 , and his stunning reverse dunk capped the 16th victory in 17 games for the third-ranked DemonS . COACH RAY MEYER bad worked his players hard all week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 last Sunday . Beating La Salle by four on the boards 29-25 did n't exactly have him jumping for joy . " Aguirre , that 's it , " Meyer replied when asked about the rebounding . " Terry Cummings was terrible . The worst I 've seen him . " Cummings had just four rebounds . So did Dillard , a guard . Except for Aguirre , no other Demon had more . The Explorers had five more rebounds than be Paul in the first half and , if not for a last-second traveling call , would have led by a point at halftime . They allowed the Demons to draw out by only as much as four before intermission , led twice themselves , and were tied four times . Joey Meyer thought De Paul 's effort was n't " something to disappointed about . We had intensity . The team had one of their better defensive games . " IT WAS JUST a matter of being on the road and having the other team play well , " said Joey . " Aguirre was awesome , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdependence . " But Aguirre is supposed to take the clutch shots in the second half . The other players have to sacrifice , and it hurts their involvement . Going to Aguirre is what we needed to do to win . " Aguirre said that if he did n't take over , someone else would have . But he admitted the- team was n't " very alert . " " We have to stop worrying about fouls and go for the rebound , " he said . " We need some knockdown , drag-out fights for the ball ? in practices and games . " However , after Meyer had the Demons knocking heads all week in drills , Dillard and Cummings said they played tired here . And even Meyer thinks , " 1 overworked them in the practices . This team needs a day off , and they 'll have it Sunday . " LA SALLE HAD a balanced a team effort rather than one standout  --  Don Word and Kevin Lynam led with 15 points each  --  and was able to play at a slower pace than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why his Explorers stayed with De Paul for so long . " We controlled the tempo , " he said . " De Paul settled into it , though , and did n't get rattled . It came down to Aguirre always being there when they needed him and De Paul being smart at critical times . " The question is whether that combination will be enough to get the Demons back here in March to compete in the NCAA championship game . That will be in the Spectrum ; Saturday 's game was in the Palestra . De Paul has n't shown that it can survive for too many games without relying on Aguirre to be the whole show . An overdependence on him is one reason the coaches and players gave for losing their first playoff game last season . Aguirre had an " off " day , and the team died . The Demons have said this season that they would n't simply live and die by Aguirre . But that is n't always the way they play . Saturday 's game emphasized that .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
