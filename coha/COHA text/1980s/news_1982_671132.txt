This combination of skills has grown of necessity . Rarely has a corporation been subjected to more scathing public criticism than Manville , which filed yesterday for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws , seeking shelter from proliferating suits filed against it by litigants claiming to be suffering from asbestos-related illnesses. // No American business has been confronted with a larger , or potentially more expensive , collection of personal injury lawsuits . Mr. McKinney , in the two years that preceded the bankruptcy filing , may have been stretched to the limit of his diverse management skills. // " You have to be impressed with the way he ' s grappled with the problem , " said Morris Mark , who follows Manville for Goldman , Sachs &; Company . " But the job is too big for anybody - he ' s been overtaken by events.

Many shipbuilding workers were exposed to asbestos during World War II . <> <> ' Approach Was Macabre ' // Mr. Tucker and the other outside directors , however , were unbending . While the board continues to hope for Federal participation in the claims , Mr. Tucker said , it felt that the protection of the bankruptcy court " allows the company to concentrate on it businesses. " // The expanding asbestos litigation has consumed a growing amount of time among Manville executives , and has threatened the company ' s financial stability . But for Mr. McKinney , who has risen rapidly through the ranks of the company ' s senior management since he was named president in 1976 , life has not always been so complicated. // Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , Mr. McKinney graduated from the United States Naval Academy and the Georgetown University Law School .

He gained additional duties as chief executive officer in 1977 , and was elected chairman 1979. // In his first two years as president , Mr. McKinney was given high marks by industry analysts for marshalling a belt-tightening program .
