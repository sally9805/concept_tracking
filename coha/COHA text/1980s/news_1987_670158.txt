NEW YORK  --  Bond prices slumped for the second consecutive day , hurt by a paucity of investor activity and trader worries about inflation . " The guy who believes bonds are a good investment isn ' t in the market right now , " said Matthew McCaffrey , a managing director at Bear , Stearns &; Co . As a result , he added , the sparse volume was dominated by dealer-to-dealer trading . The bond market ' s setback came as the dollar eased against the Japanese yen and some crude oil prices rose . Actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds fell nearly 3/4 point , or $7. 50 for each $1 , 000 face amount . " People are stepping in and stepping out of the market without much conviction , " said Robert Schoenthal , co-chief executive officer of L.F. Rothschild &; Co . " It could be a long , hot summer  --  as in dull . " Despite the recent rise in oil prices , " we ' re not likely to see much change in the outlook " for the credit markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research at Bank of America . " It ' s boring to tears and pitifully slow . " Nevertheless , this morning ' s Labor Department report on producer prices in June could intensify worries among traders and investors about inflation . According to the average estimate of 12 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report , the producer price index rose 0. 5% last month . The index rose 0. 3% in May and 0. 7% in April . Elsewhere in the credit markets , attention remained focused on the prospect of U.S. companies calling in their Eurobonds issued before July 1984 from Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries . J.C. Penney Co. became the latest corporation to jolt its Eurobond holders by announcing plans to call $550 million face amount of Eurobonds issued from the Antilles . The company said the action " was taken to protect the interests of its stockholders . " Similarly , Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. said it planned to call about $150 million face amount of Eurobonds issued from an Antilles subsidiary . Since June 29 , when the Treasury said it will terminate a 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an estimated $32 billion of affected U.S. corporate Eurobonds have been called . The calls , which were triggered by the treaty ' s termination notice , have caused millions of dollars of losses for domestic and foreign investors . Terminating the treaty would force companies with Eurobonds issued from the Antilles to take a hefty 30% withholding tax charge on interest payments linked to the Eurobonds . The Treasury , upset by investor criticism , said a week ago it would sponsor legislation to protect investors . It subsequently said that it may consider withdrawing part of its treaty termination notice to prevent companies from calling their bonds . As a result , some companies , including Citicorp and General Motors Acceptance Corp. , said they have no plans to call their Eurobonds immediately . Yesterday Caterpillar Inc. said it was withdrawing its plan to redeem a total of $440 million face amount of Eurobonds issued from the Antilles . The company said its decision was based on the Treasury ' s announcement that it would seek legislation to protect investors . Yesterday ' s new corporate offerings included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds and notes with average yields ranging from 7. 6% on floating-rate notes to 10. 2% on long-term bonds .

Underwriters led by First Boston priced the 8 3/8% notes at 99. 93 to yield 8. 4% , or about 0. 78 percentage point more than the Treasury ' s three-year note . The notes are rated Baa-1 by Moody ' s Investors Service Inc. and triple-B by S &;  --  An issue of 175 million New Zealand dollars ( $104. 2 million ) of notes by Kraft Inc. due July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2% notes at 100 1/4 to yield 16. 342% , or 1. 3 percentage point less than the New Zealand government ' s two-year note . The notes are rated double-A-1 by Moody ' s and double-A by S &; In the municipal market , bond prices also drifted lower , following the lead of U.S. Treasury bonds and the dollar . Among new issues , $65 million of general obligation convention center bonds of the Metropolitan Service District , Ore. , were offered to investors yesterday . Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the issue after an auction to yield from 4. 25% on bonds due 1988 to 7. 65% on bonds due 2011 and 2012 . Elsewhere in the municipal arena , New York City officials said the city will sell as much as $1 billion of short-term notes in a competitive sale sometime between next Thursday and Aug. 7 . The huge note auction will consist of as much as $775 million of revenue anticipation notes , which are backed by state aid payments , and a maximum of $225 million of tax anticipation notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature in June of next year . Prospective bidders will have 48 hours to submit bids for amounts of more than $25 million , according to a spokesman for Mayor Edward Koch . City officials said the exact size of the sale will be determined by an analysis of cash flow projections shortly before bids are solicited . The exact timing of the sale will be determined by " market conditions , " a city news release said . In the Treasury bond market , Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ' s index of long-term Treasury issues slumped 8. 93 points yesterday to 1295. 46 . It ranged between 1294. 07 and 1299. 91 . Among the most closely watched issues , the Treasury ' s 8 3/4% bonds due 2017 declined a price of 102 15/32 from 103 7/32 Wednesday . The yield rose to 8. 52% from 8. 45% .

The rate on funds , which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight , averaged 6. 64% in the week ended Wednesday , about the same as 6. 61% the previous week . The drop in the funds rate during the past few weeks has aroused speculation that the Federal Reserve may have loosened its credit grip just a bit . Fed officials , as usual , won ' t say one way or the other . The Fed ' s policy-making committee met Tuesday and Wednesday to review its credit strategy as well as its money supply targets . The Fed is expected to disclose its money targets and economic projections to Congress later this month . But no date has been set , nor has it been decided which Fed official will testify , a Fed spokesman said yesterday . Paul Volcker ' s term as chairman of the Reserve Board expires early next month . President Reagan has nominated Alan Greenspan as his successor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many analysts say . They contend that the economy remains sluggish and could use a little help in the form of lower interest rates . Moreover , these analysts say , the dollar ' s recent strength in the currency markets removes a roadblock to a credit-easing move . In addition , money supply growth has slowed in recent months , and some analysts fear this could be a harbinger of even slower economic growth . Yesterday , the Fed reported a huge $7. 7 billion drop in the basic money supply measure , known as M1 , for the week ended June 29 . The M1 measure , which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public , fell to a seasonally adjusted average of $742. 4 billion from $750. 1 billion the previous week . In the latest 13 weeks , M1 has averaged $749. 8 billion , which represents a 6. 5% annual growth rate from the like period 13 weeks earlier . The Fed also said borrowings from the central bank by banks and savings institutions averaged $459 million in the week ended Wednesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $534 million the week before that .
