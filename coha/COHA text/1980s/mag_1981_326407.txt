Enter Mitterrand , with a rose and plebeian touch <P> " You may my glories and my state depose , <P> But not my griefs ; still am I king of those . " <P> - King Richard II <P> For sheer theatricality , Valry Giscard d'Estaing 's passing from the presidency in France rivaled King Richard II 's dethronement in Shakespeare 's play . In a carefully staged farewell address to the nation on television last week , the defeated President seemed to concede that , like the deposed monarch , he had not yet " shook off the regal thoughts wherewith I reign 'd . " Seated at a desk in solitary grandeur in a leather-bound chair in an otherwise unfurnished room , Giscard spoke of " the end of great hopes " brought about by the election two weeks ago of Socialist Franois Mitterrand . At the same time , he pledged that he would always be at his " country 's disposal , " presumably in case the electorate should one day decide to oust the usurper . Giscard ended his address with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil prowls and strikes in the world , I hope that Providence will watch over France , for its happiness , its well-being and its greatness . " Finally , he intoned a solemn " au revoir , " rose and walked slowly out of camera view to the music of the Marseillaise . Following the President 's exit , France 's national anthem continued to be played at a dirgelike pace for 53 seconds while the camera focused on Giscard 's empty chair . <P> This generation of Frenchmen had never experienced the transfer of presidential power from one side of the political fence to the other , and they were not sure what to expect after Giscard 's regal exit . As it turned out , Franois Mitterrand 's inauguration attempted to set a deliberately plebeian tone . France 's new Socialist President arrived at the Elyse Palace dressed in a plain , dark flannel suit and a red tie . On hand to greet him at the top of the steps of the presidential palace was Giscard , who , after a brief handshake , took his successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lush gardens . There the two politicians remained closeted for a 45-minute colloquy that symbolized the transfer of presidential power . <P> Then , as Giscard walked out the front gate to his private car , Mitterrand proceeded to the tapestry-lined Salle des Ftes to greet several hundred invited guests , including local officials from the Charente region where he was born 64 years ago , Neo-Gaullist Leader Jacques Chirac in his capacity as mayor of Paris , and several Communist members of Parliament . Most conspicuous were the scores of Socialists who had assembled to witness their leader 's triumph , such as Lionel Jospin , Mitterrand 's successor as party chief , and Pierre Mends-France , 74 , former Socialist Premier in whose Cabinet Mitterrand served from June 1954 to February 1955.
