And he ' s OFF ! , gravel and sand spurting from his back wheel . . . AND HERE HE COMES , skidding dramatically as he takes the bend at the main-gate end of the drive circuit . . . AND NOW he ducks low as he TWISTS SKILLFULLY to the right under the elderberry bushes to charge along the narrow footpath . . . and , snaking around by the greenhouse with practiced economy . . . he edges dangerously close to the coke bunker wall , . . . just misses collision with the brick path-edge , and once again emerges onto the driveway to complete the final circuit and screech to an expectant halt at my feet. . . // ' ' Well ! ' ' - he sounds breathless. // ' ' Two minutes , thirty . . . nine seconds. ' ' // He groans . ' ' Still not fast enough ! Your turn ! ' ' He takes the watch while I mount Auntie Jo ' s old black bicycle with the basket on the front . ' ' Ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school term , I think it was , the two of us were treated to a day at our grandmother ' s house . Richard ' s home was right across the other side of the country , nearly in Wales . Mine had recently moved from Yorkshire in the north to Surrey in the south . Both were a long way from the boarding school in Norfolk . So Ched-grave Lodge , as Granny ' s house was called , was the nearest home-away-from-home . A day there was a day ' s escape from the rigors of school , a day of culinary treats and domestic comforts. // It was also , I realize now , a day of stepping unashamedly back into earlier childhood . The bike races , pursued with eager intensity , were really much more the sport of 9-year-olds than of the serious-minded 16- and 17-year-olds we supposedly were. // But that ' s the thing about granny houses - or this one anyway . They exist in their own time frame . It ' s not exactly stationary , but it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Auntie Jo might no longer keep the pony and trap , the tennis court might not have been in use for a few years now - but essentially things were the same as we had always known them. // The square Victorian house was covered , as ever , from eaves to surrounding gravel paths , with dense Virginia creep-er , turning crimson in the autumn . The formal flower beds in the front garden still sported roses interplanted with annuals like alyssum and ' ' cherry pie ' ' and snapdragons . The small round central pond , immeasurably deep in my imagination , still hid dozens of fat red goldfish under the burgeoning waterlily leaves. // And indoors ( as cozy as a bird ' s nest , doubly secretive because of the creeper crowding in around the small windows ) even less seemed to alter . The doors had the same heavy curtains on the back of them to stop drafts ; the same capacious armchairs and sofas overfilled the drawing room ; the same odor of some peculiar kind of soap greeted you in the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much higher off the floor than those at home , and undergirt by the most elaborate engineering - conglomerations of stuffing and hessian and oak beams and iron frameworks and enormous steel springs that made intriguing cacophonies when you climbed ( almost literally ) up on top of it all . Downstairs , Auntie Jo ' s ' ' Garden Room ' ' was a chaotic jumble of clippers and horse gear and string and seed packets ; and the kitchen , which seems in the mind ' s eye now to be by far the largest room in the house , remained the center of activity , the place of washing and cooking and gossiping , the workshop out of which issued breakfast and lunch and teatime concoctions that I associate affectionately with this house and no other : a unique version of Silverside of Beef , salty and lean , cooked in a thin gravy containing carrots and onions and dumplings ; a remarkable kind of cherry pie , full of juices . Over a long cooking time all the taste and tang from the fruit had been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soft texture alone : sounds strange , but I loved it. // The meals at Chedgrave were intriguingly different from those at home ( and exotically different from school food ) . I suspect they were recipes and techniques that had come down pretty much unaltered from the 1880s . And it was unquestionably Granny , who seemed to be by far the most ancient personage I had ever encountered , who was at the back of such unbroken traditions. // She was the hub around which all the domestic activities of that household circled . I remember her spending a great deal of time in various armchairs draped in fringed rugs ; yet she was more than the nominal head of the establishment . She may have got up late every morning , but she certainly ran the place . She decided what would be served at meals . She sat at the head of the table and dished it out. // I think now that she must have had a very special ability to resist , or ignore , change . During World War II , when everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had continued to send orders to the greengrocer and butcher in Loddon , the nearby village , that were ' ' prewar ' ' in their largess and expectations of quality . The odd thing was that the butcher and grocer complied . Perhaps , like her , the village itself , somewhat in a rural backwater , had retained a certain self-sufficiency that was able to withstand the war rigors. // Afterward , in the shortages of the ' 40s and ' 50s , she still maintained high standards of fare . In our family lore Loddon sausages and Loddon belly-pork , as continually available at Ched-grave Lodge , remain simply without equal . Some of her food was her own produce - or more accurately Auntie Jo ' s ( who was the unmarried aunt who had never flown the nest , a great favorite with us children ) : She ran a small market garden . She kept chickens and guinea fowl ( lovely speckled eggs for breakfast ) and grew vegetables as well as the scabiosa and heleniums she sold as cut flowers to the market in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raised earthy beds surrounded by beech hedges , going back to the days of the grandfather I couldn ' t remember . Delectable to eat , soused in melted butter and salt and pepper , this asparagus fascinated me by the way it grew , shooting up its strange fingers haphazardly above the soil , as if it was doing us the greatest of favors to appear at all . ( I know from attempts since , in less favorable climates , to grow this vegetable , that it is indeed reluctant to oblige . ) Since Chedgrave traditions insisted that asparagus should be eaten absolutely fresh , it was here that I was first fully conscious of the very direct connection between soil and table. // AUNTIE Jo ' s bicycle was , of course , part of the challenge in our out-from-school Races Against Time : It , like most other aspects of the granny home , had grown accustomed to a steady pace , if not a downright slow one . It creaked and com-plained as Richard and I endeavored to transform it into a speedster for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct sigh of relief when our visit was over and it could just lean against the creeper by the front door again , to be used for no more than the occasional foray to the village to get milk and cream or across the road to cut some cauliflower. // Quite possibly the sigh was echoed indoors by the lady in the armchair . But I really can ' t be sure . She always tolerated us with a good grace ; may even have been fond of us . And it never seemed to me that we posed any kind of serious threat to her persistent and well-organized continuity. // //
