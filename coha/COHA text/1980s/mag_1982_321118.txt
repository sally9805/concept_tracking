In a speech to the U.N. , the old Reagan overtakes the new <P> On the dollar bill , the American eagle is represented clutching an olive branch in one talon , a sheaf of arrows in the other . Ronald Reagan has been trying to present a somewhat similar image of his policy toward the Soviet Union : a string of arms-control proposals coupled with unyielding resistance to Soviet expansionism . Touring Europe two weeks ago , the President waved the olive branch so heavily that he stirred talk of a " new Reagan " - flexible , centrist and eager to negotiate . But last week , almost on the eve of new U.S.-Soviet disarmament talks , he decided to highlight the other aspect of his strategy . The old Reagan abruptly reappeared , rattling the arrows . <P> His forum was the second United Nations Special Session on Disarmament , a gathering in New York City that has drawn many heads of government . West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin also addressed the session last week ( an Arab-led boycott left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is expected on Wednesday . Some aides had billed President Reagan 's speech as " the capstone of his various disarmament proposals , " and indeed Reagan did repeat his suggestions for elimination of intermediate-range land-based missiles in Europe and a one-third reduction in strategic nuclear warheads deployed by the U.S. and U.S.S.R. But as delegates from 157 nations , including a sour-faced Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , listened in silence , Reagan also launched into a denunciation of Soviet behavior as blistering as any that he used to make on the campaign trail . The President : <P> &gt; Reviewed " the record of tyranny " by the U.S.S.R. since World War II and indicated that not much has changed . Said he : " Communist atrocities in Southeast Asia , Afghanistan and elsewhere continue to shock the free world as refugees escape to tell of their horror . " <P> &gt; Charged that " the decade of so-called dtente " -a phrase that must have distressed some American allies in Western Europe- " witnessed the most massive Soviet buildup of military power in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to manipulate the peace movement in the West , " a movement for whose goals Reagan had earlier expressed sympathy . <P> &gt; Accused the U.S.S.R. and its allies of waging chemical war in violation of international treaties . Said Reagan : " There is conclusive evidence that the Soviet government has provided toxins for use in Laos and Kampuchea Cambodia , and are themselves using chemical weapons against freedom fighters in Afghanistan . " <P> What does all that have to do with disarmament ? Everything , said Reagan . The U.S. will insist that any arms-control agreements contain effective procedures for verification because the Soviets can not be trusted . Without verification , said the President , " we are building a paper castle that will be blown away by the winds of war . Let me repeat : We need deeds , not words , to convince us of Soviet sincerity . "
