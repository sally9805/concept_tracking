" When the grapes are on the vine , it ' s fairly easy to tell what ' s zinfandel and what ' s not , " said Robert Steinhauer of Beringer Vineyards . " It ' s harder to tell when the grapes are in the gondola. " // Textbooks on wine making and grape growing usually identify wine grapes by the vine leaves and by the size and consistency of the bunches of grapes . Mr. Indelicato is a co-owner of Delicato Vineyards , a huge Central Valley winery that annually sells some 4 million gallons of wine in bulk to other wineries . Delicato is one of the wineries the state says was sold inferior grapes. // Some wine makers say that when wineries need fruit badly , they can be careless . In recent years many wineries have needed the fruit badly , especially zinfandel and chardonnay . Zinfandel , a red grape , is used to make the currently popular white zinfandel ( which is pale pink ) . Chardonnay , from the grape of the same name , is by far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstrips supply , and grape prices have soared . Carignane , the grape said to have been sold as zinfandel , costs about $250 a ton , zinfandel about $900 . French colombard , a grape reportedly sold as chardonnay , sells for about $150 a ton ; chardonnay can cost as much as $1 , 500 a ton. // Most of the switches were uncovered by agents of the California Department of Food and Agriculture . Three years ago they began to compare the acreages planted in grapes with the production of wines , and then began to wonder where the extra grapes were coming from. // Grape growers are required to keep records of how much they grow and who buys it . A state document , Form 707 , accompanies every load of grapes moving from vineyard to winery . That is supposed to make grape switching difficult - unless , of course , there is collusion. // In some cases agents of the state Department of Food and Agriculture have followed truckloads of the cheap grapes to see what wineries accepted them . Most of the offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a case not brought by the state , Anheuser-Busch , a major producer of wine coolers in California , learned that a large shipment of grapes it had bought as zinfandel grapes contained only 23 percent zinfandel . Anheuser-Busch reached an out-of-court settlement with the supplier , a Central Valley grape harvester who has not been identified . The harvester agreed to pay Anheuser-Busch almost $1. 1 million , approximately the difference between the value of the grapes delivered and the price of zinfandel grapes at the time. // Most of the state ' s cases involve Central Valley wineries and Central Valley grapes . The vast Central Valley , extending from Sacramento almost to Mexico , produces thousands of tons of grapes that go into inexpensive wines and wine-based products like wine coolers. // The state says a victim in three of its cases was Delicato Vineyards , which is said to be California ' s largest producer of white zinfandel . Much of this wine appears under the names of the wineries that buy it in bulk from Delicato , among them the Sutter Home Winery in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 80 , 000 tons of California grapes last year , was listed as the purchaser in three of six consumer-fraud cases currently being handled by the California Attorney General in behalf of the Department of Food and Agriculture . The state says the source of the grapes in each case is Bavaro Brothers , a Central Valley grape-harvesting firm. // The path from vineyard to consumer can be complicated . One company grows the grapes , a second harvests them . A third party , the broker , arranges their sale to a fourth , the winery . The winery , in some instances , sells to yet another winery , which bottles and sells the wine to a distributor who sells it to a retailer who sells it to the consumer. // In actions separate from the state cases , at least two well-known premium wineries are suing Bavaro Brothers , saying that the firm substituted inferior grapes . They are Charles Krug Winery in the Napa Valley and Sebastiani Vineyards in Sonoma County , premium wineries that also also produce large quantities of cheap wine , Krug under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its August Sebastiani label . Each winery is seeking $1. 2 million in damages from Bavaro Brothers , of Escalon , Calif . Sebastiani ' s annual production is about four million cases , only a fraction of it premium varietal wine . Krug makes about 1. 2 million cases a year , much of it under the C. K. Mondavi label. // While the wineries say they are victims of the grape-switching schemes , the Federal Government ' s Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms is looking into possible infractions by the wine makers themselves . " The state stops at the winery door , " said the California Deputy Attorney General Mark Urban in Sacramento . " At that point the Feds take over. " // At issue for the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms is just how much wine was made and consequently mislabeled because of the misrepresented grapes . Federal law says a varietal wine like a chardonnay must contain at least 75 percent of wine made from the grape for which it is named . The bureau has the authority to hold hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wines. // Some of the big wineries that sell in bulk to other wineries plan to blame the bureau for not telling them of the investigations before the suspect wine was bottled and labeled. // The agency will be particularly interested in signs of collusion between the wineries , desperately in need of grapes , and growers eager to supply them especially if it can be done with grapes that will bring 300 percent profit or more . Mr. Urban , noting that the complaints in the California courts are civil actions , said there is a possibility that the state might file some criminal charges , too . He declined to elaborate. // Spokesmen for grower organizations including the California Association of Winegrape Growers insisted that only a handful of growers were involved and that they hurt the reputation of thousands of honest growers throughout the state. // In fact , many large buyers of grapes minimize their chances of being hoodwinked by growers by having their own representatives in the vineyards from which they plan to buy grapes . " It ' s not difficult to get mislabeled fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine maker said . " His job is to check the sugar content of each hopper and run the stuff through . But that does ' t let the wineries off the hook . The field men should make sure each truck carries what it ' s supposed to carry. " // One thing that emerges from the various disclosures was the likelihood that the premium wine business was not and is not involved . A premium wine is loosely defined as one that sells for about $5 a bottle and up. // " This sort of thing just doesn ' t turn up on the small premium winery circuit , " said a winery owner who spoke on condition that his name not be used . " It ' s a tight little community and everybody talks to everybody else . Everyone knows everyone else ' s growers , and any funny business would soon come out. " //
