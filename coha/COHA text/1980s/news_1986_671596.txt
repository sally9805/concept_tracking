" I had held his hand and I wondered , ' How could this be ? ' I tried to imagine six million , a row of six million waiting for their trains . It didn ' t work . I couldn ' t see it .

" <> <> Capture Carefully Planned // Eichmann had been living in Argentina under the assumed name of Ricardo Clement since 1950 . A team of more than a dozen Israeli agents converged on Buenos Aires from various European cities in the spring of 1960 , and on May 11 they moved to capture Eichmann as he walked from the stop on his commuter bus to his home on an quiet suburban street . The agents carried no weapons and hid their plans and identities from Argentine authorities. // Looking through binoculars from an observation post , Mr. Malkin watched Eichmann walk that route on the nights before the capture and watched through Eichmann ' s living-room window as the seemingly innocuous , middle-aged man played on the floor with his 6-year-old son. // " I had imagined a criminal much larger , " Mr. Malkin said .

He quickly volunteered his true identity and explained that his actions had all been ordered by the German government . As the team waited for an El Al airliner that would secretly take him back to Israel , Eichmann was imprisoned in pajamas in a bedroom with his eyes covered . Each day he was given exercise and fed kosher food , cooked by an Israeli agent who was Orthodox. // As time passed , the two men began to talk. // " I told him , ' You have a beautiful boy - I saw him through the window , ' " Mr. Malkin recalled .

" // " This drove me crazy , " Mr. Malkin said . To distract himself , Mr. Malkin , who is also an amateur artist , began to draw and paint in a tourist guidebook , pictures of Eichmann and Yitzchakale , among other children he knew in Poland. // Shortly before Eichmann was sneaked aboard the Israeli airliner dressed as an airline officer , Mr. Malkin ' s commanders said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Israel voluntarily. // To get him to sign , Mr. Malkin said , he had Eichmann dress in the airline uniform , made up his face to look as young as it was when he commanded his SS troops and had him look into a mirror . Suddenly given back his identity by a figure of authority , Eichmann seemed to regain his strength , Mr. Malkin said . He poured Eichmann a glass of wine and played flamenco music on a record player. // " In a uniform he felt good again , " Mr. Malkin said . " I said , ' Why don ' t you sign ? ' " Eichmann agreed. // It was a dozen years later , long after Eichmann ' s ashes had been scattered across the Mediterranean , that Mr. Malkin revealed his role in the case to someone outside the Israeli government . It was in a whisper to his mother as she lay dying and unable to speak in a hospital in Haifa. // " I said : ' I captured Eichmann . I captured Eichmann. ' " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
