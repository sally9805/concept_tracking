 | I 'd always known that strange and wonderful things could happen at Christmas . Still , I was unprepared for the shining miracle that changed my little boy 's life I grew up believing that Christmas was a time when wise and royal visitors came riding , when at midnight the barnyard animals talked to one another , and in the light of a fabulous star God came down to us as a little Child . Christmas to me has always been a time of enchantment , and never more so than the year that my son Marty was eight . That was the same year that my three children and I had moved into a cozy new trailer home in a forested area just outside of Redmond , Wash . As the holiday approached , our spirits were light , not to be dampened even by the winter rains that swept down Puget Sound to douse our home and make our floors muddy . Throughout that December Marty had been the most spirited , and busiest , of us all . He was my youngest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quaint habit of looking up at you and cocking his head like a puppy when you talked to him . Actually the reason for this was that Marty was deaf in his left ear , but it was a condition that he never complained about . For weeks I 'd been watching Marty . I knew that something was going on with him that he was not telling me about . I saw how eagerly he made his bed , took out the trash , and carefully set the table and helped Rick and Pam prepare dinner before I got home from work . I saw how he silently collected his tiny allowance and tucked it away , spending not a cent of it . I had no idea what all this quiet activity was about , but I suspected that somehow it had something to do with Kenny . Kenny was Marty 's friend , and ever since they 'd found each other in the springtime , they were seldom apart . If you called to one , you got them both . Their world was in the meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the boys caught frogs and snakes , where they 'd search for arrowheads or hidden treasure , or where they 'd spend an afternoon feeding peanuts to the squirrels . Times were hard for our little family , and we had to do some scrimping to get by . But Kenny 's family was desperately poor , and his mother was having a real struggle feeding and clothing her two children . They were a good , solid family ; but Kenny 's mom was a proud woman , very proud , and she had strict rules . How we worked , as we did each year , to make our home festive for the holiday ! Our Christmas gifts were handcrafted and hidden away , and ornaments were strung about the place . Marty and Kenny would sometimes sit still at the table long enough to help make cornucopias or weave little baskets for the tree ; but then , in a flash , one would whisper to the other , and they would be out the door and into the horse pasture or sliding cautiously under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One night shortly before Christmas ? when my hands were deep in peppernoder dough -- shaping tiny nutlike Danish cookies that were heavily spiced with cinnamon , Marty came into the kitchen and told me in a tone mixed with great pleasure and pride , " Mom , I 've bought Kenny a Christmas present . Want to see it ? " So that 's what he 's been up to , I said to myself . " It 's something he 's wanted for a long , long time , Mom , " Marty said . After carefully wiping his hands on a dish towel , he pulled from his pocket a small box . Lifting the lid , I gazed at the pocket compass that my son had been saving all those allowances to buy . A little compass to point an eight-year-old adventurer through the woods . " It 's a lovely gift , Martin , " I said , but even as I spoke , a disturbing thought came to mind . Kenny 's family could barely afford to exchange gifts among themselves , and giving presents to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Kenny 's proud mother would not permit her son to receive something he could not return in kind . Gently , carefully , I talked over the problem with Marty . He understood what I was saying . " I know , Mom , I know . . . but what if it was a secret ? What if they never found out who gave it ? " I did n't know how to answer him . I just did n't know . And so the matter was left up in the air . The day before Christmas was rainy , cold , and gray . The three kids and I all but fell over one another as we put finishing touches on Christmas secrets and prepared for family and friends who would be dropping by . Night settled in . The rain continued . I looked out the window over the sink and felt an odd sadness . How mundane the rain seemed for a Christmas Eve . Would wise men and kings come riding on such a night ? I doubted it . It seemed to me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights when one could at least see a star in the heavens . I turned from the window , and as I checked on the ham and homemade bread in the oven , I saw Marty slip out the door . He wore his coat over his pajamas . I knew he was clutching a tiny , colorfully wrapped box in his pocket . Later he told me what happened to him that night . Down through the soggy pasture he 'd gone , then a quick slide under the electric fence and across the yard to Kenny 's house . Up the steps on tiptoes , shoes squishing ; opening the screen door just a crack ; the gift placed on the doorstep ; then a deep breath , a reach for the doorbell , and a press on it ? hard . Quickly Marty turned , ran down the steps and across the yard in a wild race to get away unnoticed . Then , suddenly he banged into the electric fence . The shock sent him reeling . He lay stunned on the wet ground . His body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakly , confused , and frightened , he struggled back home . " Marty , " we cried as he stumbled through the door , " what happened ? " His lower lip quivered , his eyes brimmed with tears . " I forgot about the fence , and it knocked me down ! " I hugged his muddy little body to me . He was still dazed , and there was a red mark from the fence beginning to blister on his face from his mouth to his ear . Quickly I treated the blister , and with a warm cup of cocoa soothing him , Marty 's bright spirits returned . I tucked him into bed , and just before he fell asleep he looked up at me and said , " Mom , I 'm sure Kenny did n't see me . " That Christmas Eve I went to bed unhappy and puzzled . The encounter with the electric fence seemed such a cruel thing to happen to a little boy while on the purest kind of Christmas mission , doing what the Lord wants us all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . I did not sleep well that night . Somewhere deep inside I think I must have been feeling the disappointment that the night of Christmas had come and it had been just an ordinary problem-filled night ? no mysterious enchantment at all . But I was wrong . By morning the rain had stopped and the sun shone . The streak on Marty 's face was very red , but I could tell that the burn was not serious . We opened our presents , and soon , not unexpectedly , Kenny was knocking on the door , eager to show Marty his new compass and tell about the mystery of its arrival . It was plain that Kenny did n't suspect Marty at all , and while the two of them talked , Marty just smiled and smiled . Then I noticed that while the two boys were comparing their Christmases , nodding and gesturing and chattering away , Marty was not cocking his head . When Kenny was talking , Marty was listening with his deaf ear ? the ear that had slammed into the fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verifying what Marty and I already knew : " Marty now has complete hearing in both ears . " The mystery of how Marty regained his hearing , and still has it , remains just that ? a mystery . Doctors suspect , of course , that the shock from the electric fence was somehow responsible . Perhaps so . Whatever the reason , I just remain thankful to God for the good exchange of gifts made that night . So you see , strange and wonderful things still happen on the night of our Lord 's birth . And one does not have to have a clear night , either , to follow a fabulous star . *
