It is advisable when visiting the Morris Louis retrospective now on view at New York City 's Museum of Modern Art to recall the claims made for this painter ten or 15 years ago . In such work , the art historian Michael Fried once wrote , " what is nakedly and explicitly at stake . . . is nothing less than the continued existence of painting as a high art . " It contained " unimagined possibilities for the future of painting . " One chews on this , moving from one sweetly august canvas to the next , enjoying the floods and diaphanous veils of color , the sheaves of burning stripes , the technical control , and marvels once more at the unpredictability of shifts in the pecking order of the American art world . Whatever painting may be argued to depend on today , it is not the lyric disembodied stain . Its possibilities for the future turned out to be not just unimagined but non-existent . History , fickle jade , balked at this fence and took a turn . One can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas , the way Jackson Pollock 's was mined by Louis and other artists of his generation . Here is the beautiful impasse , the last exhalation of symbolist nuance in America , soon to be a period style . <P> Louis was only 49 when he died of lung cancer in 1962 , and his early death made him the Thomas Chatterton of formalism , the " marvelous boy , " dying just as his genius was ready to blossom . He owes his reputation to the critic Clement Greenberg , who was also his coach . It is not really true , as has often been said , that Greenberg told Louis what to paint , though he probably had more influence over this lonely , gifted and insecure man than any American critic has had over any other artist . Nevertheless , Louis ' instinct for light as the primal theme of painting , and his desire to find a refined hedonistic syntax for it , winds back beyond Greenberg to the fact that he spent his time as a student in Washington looking at the Bonnards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Modern Art . <P> Bonnard 's light and Matisse 's luxe , run through Greenberg 's reduction mill and then filtered by Louis ' own obsession with the ethereal , came out in a curiously attenuated form . But it supported  --  and after Louis ' death was in turn supported by  --  the argument that after Pollock painting had only one way to go . No more figures , organic symbolism or utopian geometry ; no more gestural surfaces , tonal structure or cubist layering of space . In future , art would hang onto the spread-out , expansive quality of Pollock 's work while refreshing it with a new intensity of color , inspired by Matisse . At the end of the purge you would have a clipped but radiant discourse of pure hue , fixed by an exaggerated pictorial flatness , done in thinned translucent washes that became the surface . Louis ' direct inspiration for this was an early canvas by Helen Frankenthaler , Mountains and Sea , 1952 , whose liquid blotches and airy sense of light struck him , in one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Pollock and what was possible .
