Louis Wertheimer remembers the question that flashed through his mind when he first saw the sparkling waters of Lake Chapala and realized how cheaply he could live there . " I asked myself , Why is n't everyone here ? " he recalls . Twenty-seven years later the former Buffalo businessman has coped with most of the problems  --  slow repairs , distant doctors  --  that can confront a foreigner living in Mexico . Still , he wonders why the torpid town of Ajijic that he calls home is not overrun with gringos looking for the good life . <P> Wertheimer , 75 , is one of an estimated 50,000 Americans who live permanently south of the Rio Grande . Aside from businessmen and diplomats posted in Mexico City , there are growing enclaves of foreigners who live in small Mexican towns . For instance , about 12,000 Americans , many of them retired , bask in the gentle refinement of Cuernavaca , some 50 miles south of the capital . <P> The area around Lake Chapala , in the central state of Jalisco , has been attracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ II , many recently discharged veterans . The phenomenon also began attracting retirees . About 5,000 foreigners reside in such towns as Chapala , Ajijic and Chula Vista . The main attraction in all three communities is the climate : daytime temperatures hover in the 70s and 80s . In addition , Chapala offers tree-lined streets and a backdrop of mountains . In Chula Vista the rambling houses and ample yards might be mistaken for a California suburb . High-walled haciendas and the sight of burros ambling down cobblestone streets endow Ajijic with postcard charm . <P> But residents must overlook some imperfections , like the occasional carcass of a horse or a dog on the 30-mile highway to Guadalajara , the nearest city . They must avoid impure drinking water and ignore iffy electricity and open sewers on the streets where they live . Finding an English-speaking doctor can be difficult , and Medicare does not cover the fees . <P> Satisfied settlers accentuate the positive . The lakeside towns report almost no violent crime involving foreigners , so elderly couples can take evening saunters without fear . Household help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electricity and water bills amount to a few dollars a month . Local restaurants are a bargain . The La Viuda cafe in Chapala , for example , charges $2 for half a broiled chicken with all the trimmings . Even U.S. television is available for those who invest about $5,000 in a parabolic-dish antenna . Richard Tingen , a Chapala real estate agent , has a hard time convincing potential residents how far their dollars will go . Says he : " I explain to people that their house has rooms for the maid and the gardener , and they just look at me . Hell , some of them used to be maids and gardeners . " <P> The homes offered by Tingen and his competitors range from a " basic Mexican two-bedroom house " that recently fetched $13,000 to a $275,000 villa complete with Jacuzzi and putting green . But most customers are retired middle-class couples who have sold their homes in the U.S. and have $60,000 to $80,000 to invest .                 @ @ @ @
