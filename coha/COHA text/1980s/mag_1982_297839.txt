MISSING Directed by Costa-Gavras <P> Screenplay by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart <P> TRAGEDY OF A RIDICULOUS MAN <P> Directed and Written by Bernardo Bertolucci <P> The argument goes like this : every movie is propaganda . Every character is a walking placard-for capitalism or idealism or monogamy or the status quo . Every shot , by its placement and rhythm and duration , is one more Pavlovian command to the viewer . A narrative movie is usually successful to the extent that it obscures these facts , transforms the thesis into entertainment and the placards into persuasive semblances of human beings . <P> In Z and State of Siege , Costa-Gavras turned politics into melodrama ; he propelled the Good Leftists and the Bad Rightists into collision so headlong that the moviegoer had little time to ponder the ideology . In The Conformist and 1900 , Bernardo Bertolucci turned politics into opera ; anyone susceptible to visual grandeur could be swept away by the characters ' emotional arias and the camera 's delirious glissandos . Now each has made a film about political kidnaping in a turbulent country-Chile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has approached the subject at a more measured pace . Without the stylistic filigrees , one can undistractedly sift for political meaning . The effect is like curling up late at night with the latest report from Amnesty International : you may have nightmares , but first you will fall asleep . <P> Charles Herman was a Harvard-educated journalist , writing for The Nation and public TV . In 1972 he and his wife arrived in Chile , and , 15 months later , during the bloody coup that deposed Salvador Allende , he disappeared . In outline , Charles looks like a modern , minor John Reed . But Missing is not his story . Instead , it tracks the attempts of Charles ' wife ( Sissy Spacek ) and father ( Jack Lemmon ) to discover whether the young man is indeed missing or dead-killed by the junta for crimes unknown . <P> The trail leads Ed and Beth Herman-at first abrasive adversaries , then trusting amateur detectives-through the blood-streaked boulevards of Santiago and into the American embassy 's labyrinth of red-white-and-blue tape . There they confront the anesthetizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the movie begins lumbering to a halt , elaborating the obvious with political ironies that stick their thumb in the viewer 's eye . A story that could have made for a brisk jeremiad on 60 Minutes is stretched to 122 minutes of heroes fuming and villains purring their oleaginous apologies . Spacek and Lemmon , an appealing sweet-and-sour combo , sink in the swamp of good intentions . Perhaps Costa-Gavras should jump back on the locomotive of melodrama . When he stands still , he builds prefab tract houses .
