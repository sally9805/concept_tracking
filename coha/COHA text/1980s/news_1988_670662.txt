" I ' m giving him backing and let people know that people are with him , " said Dorise Clay , 64 years old , outside a polling place in West Philadelphia this afternoon , " We ' re still behind him . He ' s the first black to have enough courage and nerve. " // While those who voted were still strongly for Mr. Jackson , many blacks stayed home in a turnout that disappointed his supporters and set his local staff and national campaign into disagreement. // City Councilman Lucien Blackwell , the Jackson campaign ' s state chairman , accused the national campaign of wasting the candidate ' s time stumping in Western Pennsylvania " trying to drum up blue-collar votes that did not materialize. " // " I believe we should have concentrated on Philadelphia , " he said. // Other Jackson supporters noted , however , that Mr. Jackson had virtually doubled his vote in Pennsylvania over the 1984 results and had spent more than half his campaign time in Philadelphia .

Since white turnout was low , a higher black turnout would have made the race much closer. // Gov . Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts outpolled Mr. Jackson by a 2-to-1 ratio. // Outside polling places today and in interviews across the state over the last few days Mr. Jackson ' s backers sounded a positive and unified theme . Even those voters who feel Mr. Jackson ' s time may not be have come want him to continue with his campaign in the pursuit of other goals : to send a message on issues , to win the Vice Presidential nomination , to get a head start on a 1992 campaign or just to find out how far he can go. // " Run on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocky ) Brown of Chester , said in an opening prayer that set the tone not only for a dinner in Philadelphia on Thursday night but also for Mr. Jackson ' s continuing campaign . " Run and see what the end will be. " // Mr. Jackson ' s supporters knew that , with fewer than one of every five voters in this state being black , there were not nearly enough to bring Mr. Jackson victory here , even though one in six white voters supported Mr. Jackson today . <> <> ' He ' s Already Won ' // Sue Wright , a reading teacher at an all-black elementary school , took her class to a polling place in West Philadelphia today. // " They say things like ' Jesse , Jesse ' , " she said . " There ' s a lot of rah rah . They think there ' s some reason to participate . They ' re talking about voting. " // Ms. Wright , who is white , said she was voting for Mr. Jackson , too , even though she understood he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s already won , " said Karen Dabney , a banquet caterer , before voting in North Philadelphia. // More than 90 percent of blacks who went to the polls today voted for Mr. Jackson , according to a New York Times/ CBS News poll of voters . They said their support was undiminished by Mr. Jackson ' s loss last week in New York to Mr. Dukakis or by the large lead that pollsters told them Mr. Dukakis had in Pennsylvania. // " I ' m not upset , " said Khadijah Abdus-Shahid , an 18-year-old freshman at West Chester State College . " I still think he has a chance . I feel he ' s an honest man . Even if he doesn ' t win the Presidency , I ' d be very happy if he won the Vice Presidency. " // " It didn ' t matter to me whether he ' s got the nomination or not , " said Robert Scott , a 42-year-old business school student , after voting for Mr. Jackson in West Philadelphia . " He was the person of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was supporting Mr. Jackson " even if he doesn ' t win. " // " I am voting because he is black , " said Mr. Townes , " And I ' d like to see him win because I am black . I like the underdog . He ' s the only one who talks about real issues . " <> <> Moderate Turnout // The turnout in black districts of Philadelphia was described as moderate , well below the overwhelming turnout that last year helped Mayor W. Wilson Goode defeat Frank L. Rizzo in a racially polarized election. // Gerald Austin , Mr. Jackson ' s campaign manager , said the Pennsylvania campaign had been hampered by local infighting . " Folks in Philadelphia , " he said dryly , " did not acknowledge that anything west of Philadelphia existed. " // He also said Mr. Jackson had not spent enough time in Pennsylvania , concentrating on the New York primary , and that may have hurt the black turnout. // " People are proud and excited " about Mr. Jackson ' s campaign , said State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominantly black 10th Ward . " They wonder how far can he go . " " <> <> Looking Ahead // John Hodges , a mail handler , stood in a crowd to hear Mr. Jackson at a Philadelphia housing project the other day . " I took three hours annual leave so I wouldn ' t miss it , " he said . " He ' ll do good this year . But the next election , he ' ll win that one. " // At a fund-raising cruise for Mr. Jackson on the Monongahela River in western Pennsylvania Saturday , Christus Meekins , president of the student association at the state college in the town of California , said he recognized that Mr. Jackson was in an uphill struggle. // " It ' s going to be hard for him , " he said . " I really believe the stop Jackson movement is in full swing . I think money has a lot to do with it. " // Mr. Dukakis , he said , was not a bad guy but , " I believe because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be for the rich . He ' s from where the money is even though he ' s a Democrat . Jackson grew up with the working people. " //
