Since coming to power with Cuban and Soviet military assistance in November 1975 , the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) has been caught up in civil war with the independence fighters - former allies - who did not win a place in the government . The rebel forces of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) are active in the southern , central , and western parts of the country . The National Front for the Liberation of Angola ( FNLA ) reportedly has begun to assert itself again in the north. // And on the economic front , the country has not yet recovered from the massive exodus of white Portuguese skilled labor and investers which began with Angola ' s independence. // Although the Angolan and South African governments appear to have agreed to a cease-fire , there is a threat of incursions by South African forces similar to those carried out in the latter half of 1981 and early 1982 against Namibian ( South-West African ) nationalist fighters based in Angola .

Without South African support , MPLA leaders say , the UNITA rebels would be unable to continue their ' ' bandit ' ' activities against the government. // Angolan Foreign Minister Paulo Jorge has repeatedly condemned the Reagan administration ' s concept of ' ' linkage ' ' in addressing this region ' s problems . He says it is ' ' unacceptable ' ' and ' ' makes no sense at all ' ' to link any South African troop withdrawal from Namibia with a Cuban withdrawal from Angola. // Nevertheless , Mr. Jorge has never quite closed the door on such a solution . Nor has he totally dismissed the efforts of the Western ' ' contact group ' ' ( the United States , Britain , West Germany , France , and Canada ) , which is trying to find a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December with a South African delegation in Cape Verde to discuss these issues . A third meeting is being contemplated. // A promising development is the frequent talks between US and Angolan officials , even though the two countries have no diplomatic relations . A knowledgeable source says talks are ' ' hardly moving at all for the moment , ' ' but there is a willingness to continue . In fact , Jorge met with Secretary of State George Shultz in New York while attending a Security Council session on Namibia. // The Americans have told MPLA officials that Washington would continue to withhold recognition of Angola until Cuban troops have left and a political accommodation involving the rebel Angolan UNITA forces is worked out. // From the US viewpoint , UNITA should be regarded as a legitimate political representative of the Angolan people , just as the MPLA is . ( Both groups fought for independence from Portugal , but the MPLA grabbed power in 1975 with Cuban and Soviet military assistance . ) The Reagan administration appears morally to support the rebels , but the 1976 ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNITA. // Luanda has always maintained that it will politely ask the Cubans to leave once the South African military menace has been eliminated . Although the MPLA leadership categorically dismisses any suggestions of working out a political deal with UNITA , European diplomatic sources maintain that Luanda moderates have been cultivating discreet contacts with the rebels. // ' ' The ( MPLA ) hard-liners are still the ones calling the shots , ' ' a West European analyst says , ' ' but there are a growing number of people in the Angolan government who realize that UNITA is a force that can not be dismissed and if there is going to be an end to the country ' s problems , then the rebels will have to be given a participatory role.

Once-bustling markets and shops are empty , boarded up , or struggling with long lines of customers . Once self-sufficient in food , Angola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the height of the colonial era , Angola was the world ' s fourth-ranking coffee grower . But production has withered ; once it harvested 200 , 000 tons of coffee a year , now only 15 , 000 to 20 , 000 tons . Diamond and iron ore mining suffer , too. // Rebels effectively closed the Benguela railway , which bore trade items to and from landlocked African neighbors . The closure is a major factor in Angola ' s economic reversal . Lack of rail traffic means the loss of $50 million to $100 million of transit fees annually from Zaire and Zambia. // Oil reserves , on the other hand , furnished the regime with extensive foreign export earnings in its early years . The income allowed the MPLA to pay its military bills and granted Angolans , statistically , the highest per capita income in black Africa. // But oil income has dropped . Despite projections of a doubling or even tripling of Angolan oil production by the end of the decade , the world oil glut resulted in severe drops in production .

The MPLA regime concedes the country faces severe difficulties , but it generally blames the South African government for its economic troubles. // Any post-colonial government would have found it difficult to regroup in Angola after independence , analysts say . The country ' s infrastructure crumbled with the panic-stricken exodus of most of the territory ' s 350 , 000 whites at independence . In contrast with other European colonial powers in Africa , the Portuguese had done little to encourage black participation in the Angolan economy . Most of the shops , transport , and manufacturing industries were run by whites . Barely 2 percent of the country ' s available arable land was cultivated , either in the form of large , European-operated plantations or small , native-run subsistence plots. // After independence , East European and Cuban advisers helped to advance the nation ' s agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luanda signed a 20-year friendship treaty with the Soviet Union in 1976 , followed in 1982 by an economic pact . But since 1978 , Angola has looked increasingly to the West for financial and technical expertise. // Several thousand non-East bloc technicians - Portuguese , Brazilian , French , West German , British , and American - work in Angola on a contract basis . Gulf , Texaco , and other corporations have quietly expanded their activities to tap the former colony ' s estimated 150-160 million tons of oil reserves. // The country has tried to pay its debts on time , and this has helped investors to look on Angola as a reliable investment area . Major banks such as Chase Manhattan and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa have begun significant development projects . Luanda ' s Western-backed petroleum investment plan alone is said to be worth $1 billion. // About 85 percent of Angola ' s exports , mainly oil , go to the West . The communist bloc absorbs only 8 percent of the country ' s overseas trade . Moscow has warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The MPLA has a love-hate relationship with South Africa . It maintains close economic relations with Pretoria even as it chastises UNITA for taking military support from South Africa . Roughly 90 percent of Angola ' s trade within Africa is with South Africa . In April 1980 , Angola joined eight black neighbors to form the Southern African Development Coordination Conference - a group dedicated to attaining economic self-sufficiency and reducing economic dependence on Pretoria. // South Africa , the US , and the Soviet Union all have vested interests in Angola ' s political future . John Marcum , a specialist in southern African affairs at the University of California at Santa Cruz , wrote in ' ' Africa Notes ' ' this year : // ' ' For the Soviet Union , the entry of UNITA into the Luanda government would , like the departure of the Cubans , constitute an embarrassing political setback. // ' ' For South Africa , a role for UNITA in Luanda would vindicate the earlier decision to assure UNITA ' s survival .
