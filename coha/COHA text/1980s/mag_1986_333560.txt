Casper the Friendly Ghost is an amiable , almost cherubic-looking cartoon character . But his creator , Harvey Publications , felt downright hostile when the company 's executives saw the logo for Columbia Pictures ' 1984 blockbuster movie Ghostbusters . The logo featured a cartoon ghost behind the symbol for prohibition , a red circle with a bar across its center . Two years ago , Harvey filed a $50 million lawsuit claiming copyright and trademark infringement . The company claimed that the logo copied a Harvey cartoon character named Fatso , one of a trio of ghosts that taunt Casper . <P> Last week a U.S. district court dismissed the suit . " There are only very limited ways to draw the figure of a cartoon ghost , " said Judge Peter Leisure . But the ghost could come back to haunt another judge because Harvey may appeal the ruling .
