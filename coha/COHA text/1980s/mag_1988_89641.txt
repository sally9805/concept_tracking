The hottest sports collectible of the 1980s is a tiny piece of enameled jewelry that costs 60 to 90 cents to produce and retails for about five bucks . It is the Olympic pin , and it owes a debt to the Byzantine Empire , the desert tortoise and a parking lot at the corner of 39th St. and Figueroa in Los Angeles . // Intrigued ? Read on . You may want to become a pinhead yourself . // What is a pinhead ? It 's someone who has been taken with a desire to collect pins . Pinheads , as even the collectors call themselves , have been known to offer as much as $6,000 for a single Burmese Olympic pin . In 1984 a California pinhead bought stock in several corporations just to get more of their Olympic sponsorship pins . Pinheads bargain , beg , plead and occasionally turn into pin counterfeiters to sustain their habit . They are elderly women in Pomona and eight-year-olds in Nashville and corporate vice-presidents in New York who sport silly baseball caps crowded with constellations of pins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Eddie Chein , whose Commerce , Calif. - based company , Ooh La La ! Inc. , produced an estimated 30 million pins as official pin licensee of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles . // Pinheads first appeared in large numbers during those Summer Games , on the aforementioned parking lot , which happens to be across the street from the L.A. Coliseum . As many as 20,000 collectors a day  --  most with cash in their pockets and Olympic fever inflaming their senses  --  crowded into hectic and hot pin swapping and selling tents set up on the lot . The result was pin hysteria . // People tore apart $300 framed sets to sell pins individually at huge profits . A woman 's purse was stolen , then found  --  with no cash missing , only pins . L.A. lawyer Gary Ruttenberg recalls being beset by pinheads while crossing Figueroa . " I sold $325 worth of pins and never stopped walking , " he says . A collector offered Chein $50,000 cash for every pin in his booth . Gift Creations Inc. of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow , suddenly sold out its entire warehouse of Moscow pins . " One day we could n't give them away , the next they were selling for $8 and $10 , " says Steve Klein , the company 's executive vice-president , still shaking his head . // Rest assured , a similar fever will grip Calgary , site of the XV Winter Olympics . While some pinheads work the street corners and mountainsides , others will hunker down in either of the Games ' two planned pin-swapping centers : one next to the athletes ' village , the other downtown , just 50 yards from Olympic Plaza , where each night the Olympic medals will be awarded . // The downtown center , to be known as the Coca-Cola/Calgary International Plaza , will be a heated , 22,000-square-foot tent . Half of it will house a food festival and the other half will be dedicated to a carnival of pin swapping and selling . The trading area will be open 12 hours a day and will feature an audiovisual system that will carry pin-trading instructional films and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give pin ' stock-market ' reports ' Bulgarian bobsleds are now trading for 16 Swiss downhills , ' that sort of thing , " says Roy Fleming , who is a media-relations manager for Coca-Cola . // Outside , pins will become an unofficial form of currency . At L.A. , athletes left pins as tips for their Olympic Village hairdressers . Drivers used them to buy their way into " full " parking lots . Reporters used them to bribe their way into off-limits areas . // Pins have actually been around the Olympics for decades . They evolved from coin-like metal identification badges worn by officials at Games in the early 1900s , to partially enameled pins given to competitors in the 1930s , to today 's mass-produced , fully enameled pins . It 's refreshing to find that most Olympic athletes still look upon the pins as tokens of friendship rather than high-priced collectibles . " I give most of mine away to kids , " says bobsledder Matt Roy of Lake Placid , who nevertheless still has a collection of 200 . " If an athlete from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always try to give him one of yours  --  but only as an act of thanks . It is n't a competitive type of trading . " Roy does claim one of the world 's oddest pins : an Eastern European bobsled pin with a rugged-looking screw-thread fastener instead of a pin clasp . // It 's numbing to consider that there are already more than a quarter of a billion pins of one type or another in circulation throughout the world . No one knows who has the largest collection , but Ruttenberg alone has donated about 3,000 different Olympic pins to the L.A. County Museum of Natural History . " My wife has 7,000 pins from the sport of curling , " says Laurie Artiss of Regina , Saskatchewan , official pin licensee of the Calgary Games , " and she is n't even the biggest curling collector in Canada . " // It has become a big business . Artiss outbid 67 other companies for the Calgary pin franchise , the most sought-after exclusive-rights contract of the Winter Games . He guaranteed the organizing committee a minimum return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peanuts compared to the $1.25 million promised to the U.S. Olympic Committee by its pin licensee for the Calgary and Seoul Summer Games , Ho Ho Art &amp; Craft International of New York . Ho Ho is required to give the USOC 10% of every pin sale , thus making pin buying a patriotic act . // If you 're a collector , this business stuff can be bad news : Even though Ho Ho and Artiss are producing completely different assortments of Calgary pins  --  thereby increasing the variety available  --  each is legally restricted in distributing them . Artiss ca n't sell his pins in the U.S. , and Ho Ho ca n't sell its product in Canada . // That 's unfortunate , because in most respects the pin phenomenon knows no boundaries . Write to Tehran and you 'll get an Iranian Olympic pin delivered to your mailbox . Visit northern Canada and you 'll find the Inuit asking how to join collectors ' clubs . Drop a friendly note to a certain King Moshoeshoe II and an Olympic pin from his southern African nation of Lesotho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . // The ' 88 Olympics will bring a new wave of pins to collect . Artiss will produce as many as eight million pins in around 600 styles for the Calgary Games . Ho Ho Art &amp; Craft will manufacture perhaps 40 million Olympic pins in 400 designs for the two Games . " It 's a good thing pins are small , " says Rowan Fay , a Marcy , N.Y. , pastor and president of the 2,000-member International Pin Collectors " Club . " If these were antique cars , we 'd need a pretty big barn . " // Among the new faces to be found on Calgary pins will be Hidy and Howdy , the Games ' polar bear mascots , and the OlympiKids , the Hanna-Barbera cartoon creations being marketed by the USOC . If tradition holds , however , those most in demand at the Winter Games will be ABC pins , team pins , press pins , International Olympic Committee pins and any other rare or unusual issues . A few examples from the past : // Sam the Eagle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only 400 pins were made before the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee halted production on the grounds that Sam could not be shown endorsing a product . Value : up to $1,700. // Arrowhead Mineral Water sponsor pin showing Sam holding a water glass . Same situation as with Sam holding the bottle of Coke . Approximately 1,500 were produced . Value : up to $250. // Merrill Lynch Sarajevo pin with a white background and a blue snowflake and black bull on it . Use of black bull on white background violated Merrill Lynch 's trademark guidelines . Only 1,000 produced . Value : $400. // Sarajevo Coca-Cola pin with the LAOOC trademark stamped on the back by mistake . Value : $100. // ABC Engineering mouse pin from ' 84 Games . Unauthorized by ABC , the pin was put out by company employees . Because of an enameling error , the mouse is wearing pants on some pins and is without them on others . No-pants pin is slightly more valuable . Value : up to $200. // It should be noted that these prices are rough estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  and that can change overnight . The market fell to pieces after the L.A. Games , when a flood of counterfeit pins arrived from overseas . " We were approached many times to take an official Olympic pin and reproduce it , " recalls Klein , whose company has contracts with plants in Taiwan . " Some people wanted strange variations . One guy wanted us to make Misha Moscow 's 1980 bear mascot as a punk , with a Mohawk haircut and a leather jacket . We said no . " Some exotic knockoffs did appear , including one showing Sam with a drink in hand and his hat cocked , next to the words THE PARTY 'S OVER . // Nearly all pins are handmade in Taiwan , where labor is cheap and craftsmen plentiful . Some pins are coated with enamel paint and clear acrylics , but the best are those fashioned with cloisonn enamel  --  a powdered , colored glass that is mixed with water , brushed into tiny reservoirs on the pin face and fired in a furnace . The Byzantines pioneered the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not improved on it much since then . " You can not scratch a cloisonn pin because it is so hard , " says Chein. // Enameling techniques , of course , are of minor concern to most pin traders . " The best part of pin collecting for me is meeting people from all over the world who do n't even speak your language and being able to communicate with them , " says David Komansky , the president of Merrill Lynch Realty in Stamford , Conn . " Among pin traders there is an immediate bond . " Komansky , who has roughly 1,000 different pins , claims he had his first " conversation " in Russian while standing on a ski slope at the Sarajevo Winter Games next to a Soviet army officer . The Soviet badly wanted to trade for a Merrill Lynch pin Komansky was wearing , but Komansky kept saying nyet as the officer pointed to one pin after another on his uniform . " Finally I pointed to the Red Star on his cap , " says Komansky . " It took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Soviets have long been the world 's most avid collectors of pins , which they call znachki . Any visitor to Moscow will find plastic and cheap metal znachki for sale in every department store and news kiosk for prices ranging from 10 kopecks ( about 18 cents ) to a ruble ( $1.80 ) . The pins commemorate everything from Communist Party congresses to anniversaries of collective farms . // Znachki are so ubiquitous that in 1974 the Communist Party newspaper Pravda even complained that pin production in the U.S.S.R. was " growing catastrophically " and using up too much of the nation 's scarce raw materials . That attack , however , may have been prompted less by fears of a metal shortage than by the discovery of several politically embarrassing znachki , including a dog-club pin that resembled a Soviet military decoration . // Perhaps the leading source for pin trivia is professor emeritus of marketing Bill Nelson of Tucson and the University of Arizona , who publishes three pin-collectors ' newsletters . Nelson , 47 , was forced to retire from teaching ten years ago because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Julie , have built a mail-order pin distributorship that would wow the folks at Wharton . They ship out every order the day they receive it  --  insured , guaranteed , with a personal letter enclosed . // " I 've never had so much fun in my life , " says Nelson , an inexhaustible devotee of gadgetry , history , marketing theory and just about anything else you can think of . In a given lunch hour , one might find Nelson crouched under a shrub in his backyard , looking for one of the 12 desert tortoises he and Julie care for . The tortoises are a threatened species , and the Nelsons hope to raise enough money through their pin business to fund a desert preserve for them . " They 're the whole reason for the pin business , " says Bill . // Nelson describes his customers as " a very American group . We get a lot of checks with flags and Biblical quotations and John Wayne sayings on them . " Many of the people send Nelson Christmas gifts for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves covered head-to-toe in pins . " One guy sent us a picture of himself delivering milk , which I have n't quite figured out , " says Nelson . " Somebody else sends a little wheel of fortune that you spin . It has things on it like SEND ME A FREE PIN Or YOU CAN GET A FREE DATE WITH ME. " // In his newsletters , Nelson may , say , offer $5 off an order of three $25 M &amp; M-Mars pins from the L.A. Olympics if a reader can tell him which original color M &amp; M  --  besides red , which is being produced again as of this year  --  is no longer made . " This hobby is supposed to be enjoyable , " he says . " People should n't look at it as an investment or something . That 's what ruined baseball cards . Let 's just have fun . " // Taking that as the pinhead motto , let 's review what might be called the Pin Commandments : // 1 ) Thou shalt subscribe to THE BILL NELSON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , THE PIN COLLECTORS NEWSLETTER ( Box 227 , Marcy , N.Y . 13403 ) and THE OLYMPIN NEWSLETTER ( 1386 Fifth St. , Schenectady , N.Y . 12303 ) . // 2 ) Thou shalt write hundreds of letters to embassies , federations and corporate sponsors asking for free Olympic pins . " Be polite but very insistent , " advises Frank Vias of New York , whose pin collection totals more than 350 . " If it 's a company , tell them you love their product . " // 3 ) Thou shalt plan thy vacations around major sporting events . // 4 ) Thou shalt scour flea markets looking for discarded pins . // 5 ) Thou shalt never buy , sell or commission knockoffs. // 6 ) Thou shalt be completely honest , especially in dealing with other pin traders . // 7 ) Except sometimes , such as when offered a dusty old ABC pin from the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck ( value : $125 ) in exchange for two shiny new Seoul Olympic pins ( value : $10 ) . // 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan . // 9 ) Thou shalt trade rather than buy whenever possible . // 10 ) Thou shalt treat pins with reasonable care , displaying them on caps , vests , parkas , flags , Christmas stockings , towels , ceiling tiles and bulletin boards , or in official pin frames . Thou shalt not toss them into shoe boxes or drawers . // There is n't much logic involved in becoming a pinhead . You devote yourself to collecting the logos of corporations you do n't work for , teams you do n't belong to and nations you 've never visited . From a marketing perspective , however , pins may be the greatest creation the world has ever seen . " People pay to wear your ad , " says Nelson . " What 's better than that ? "
