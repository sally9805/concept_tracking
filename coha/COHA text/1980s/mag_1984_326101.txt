COMFORT AND JOY <P> According to the radio , eight Christmas truces are threatening to unravel , and in the Moscow zoo the panda is either pregnant or dying . At home in Glasgow , having finished her Christmas shoplifting , Disc Jockey Alan Bird 's girlfriend of four years walks out on him in the middle of decorating the tree . His dentist hurts , a psychiatrist is uncomprehending , and both sides in the territorial war between Mr. Bunny and McCool 's , mobile purveyors of ice cream , keep damaging his car to register displeasure at his peacemaking efforts . In short , it is a fairly typical , that is to say awful , Yuletide season , and Comfort and Joy is a fairly typical , that is to say wonderful , Bill Forsyth comedy . As Gregory 's Girl and Local Hero showed , he is a director whose best shots are sidelong glances , a writer whose best lines are murmured asides . In Bill Paterson , who plays Bird , Forsyth has the perfect spokesman for his dismayed , determined reasonableness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the miniature souffl . <P> TEACHERS <P> Like its subject , the public high school , Teachers is undone by its aspiration to be all things to all members of its constituency . Sometimes it is a sardonic assault on institutional idiocy , something Director Arthur Hiller once managed pretty well in The Hospital . Sometimes it is a sentimental plea for humanistic faculty-student relationships , sometimes a romantic comedy and sometimes The Blackboard Jungle revisited . Mostly , however , it is a mess . Screenwriter W.R. McKinney wrenches his plot endlessly , attempting to make plausible the weird shifts in tone . The leads ( Nick Nolte and JoBeth Williams ) and a raft of good supporting players are simply set adrift , looking for a logical line to which their bedraggled characters might cling . There are no survivors . <P> STRANGER THAN PARADISE <P> This saggy-dog story , made for $120,000 by American Independent Film Maker Jim Jarmusch , asks the musical question : How hip are you ? A coupla white guys sit around talking , or moping . One of the guys plays desultory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them meet up in Cleveland , then drive to Florida for two improbable plot twists . There are only 67 shots , each separated from the next by a few seconds of blackness , and three funny bits . Artfully done , with offhand references to directors ranging from Byron Haskin to Yasujiro Ozu , Stranger Than Paradise has the odd odor of something left too long behind Aunt Bela 's chintz couch . Yet it has been extravagantly praised and is a box-office success in its Manhattan debut . Rarely has a movie so fetid been so feted.
