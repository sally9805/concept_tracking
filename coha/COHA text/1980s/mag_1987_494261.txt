DEAR GORBO THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT is your big chance , and also your last chance . You let the Geneva summit in 1985 turn into an inconsequential gabfest , which is exactly what President Reagan wanted . You managed to embar ? rass Reagan by springing a no-nukes , no-Star Wars scheme at Reykjavik in 1986 . That was a public relations victory , but nothing more . Next year 's summit in Moscow will be too late in Reagan 's term for any real progress on the issues you are pushing . So it 's now or never in Washington . The good news , Mr. General Secretary , is that you can get everything you crave at the Washington summit , if you play your cards right . And I mean everything : limits on Star Wars , expanded trade with the West , easing of pressure to open up Jewish emigration and get out of Afghanistan , a boost in stature back home , and a new era of d ? tente . But remember : you have to play to three audiences at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American public , are easy . The third , Reagan , is the tricky one . All the Soviet people will learn about your visit is what the Kremlin lets them see on TV and read in the newspapers . For home consumption , you have to look like a visiting emperor , friendly but businesslike and less-than-awed by America . You ca n't appear to be led around by the nose by Reagan . If you kiss Reagan , all is lost . That would expose you as weak , emotional , and undisciplined . In Vienna in 1979 after the signing of the SALT II treaty , Leonid Brezhnev lurched toward Jimmy Carter and kissed him . It brought home the point that Brezhnev , who had dribbled soup down his chin at dinner , was a vegetable . The American people will see a lot more of you , since your public appearances will be telecast live . They are suckers for a cheerful dictator , and you got off to a good start by grinning your way through the NBC interview with Tom Brokaw . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the country . You also need better answers to a couple of questions . On the Berlin Wall , you should hint that it 's coming down soon . On Jewish refuseniks , you should give the impression that you 're about to let them all out . In both cases , you 'd be following an old piece of advice : in a pinch , lie . It often works . Where you stand to gain the most is one-on-one with Reagan . The president is vulnerable . He 's old and down ? cast . Iranamok took the wind out of him . Most of his friends are dead , gone , or under indictment . He 's got Nan ? cy , but she 's recovering from surgery . For Reagan these days , it really is lonely at the top . Avoid confrontation with Reagan . It violates his sense of gentlemanly conduct . In 1984 he toned down his anti-Soviet rhetoric in a United Nations speech because Andrei Gromyko , then Soviet foreign minister , was about to visit . To Reagan , being confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you argue that Star Wars must be sharply curtailed or else no strategic arms agreement , there will be no agreement . Reagan wo n't give in to threats . If you insist that Jewish emigration is none of Reagan 's business , you 'll only anger him and get no trade concessions . If you say the Soviets will stay in Afghanistan as long as they please , you 'll put Reagan all the more on edge . The last thing Reagan wants is another adversary . He 's got enough of them in Washington . You should avoid bullying or reminding Reagan that his power is dimin ? ished . Reagan needs a pal . So that 's the role for Gorbo , Reagan 's buddy in the Kremlin . The president already has a reasonably favorable impression of you . He does n't think you are another Stalin or even another Andropov . Gorba ? chev , Reagan says , is " completely different . " You 're not out to conquer the world . Rather , the president thinks you have " an internal problem and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in solving both of them . BUT FIRST you 've got to break the ice . And what better way than with a joke ? Reagan loves jokes . Donald Regan solidified his position ( for a while , anyway ) by telling Reagan a joke every morning . Now the president is collecting jokes about the Soviet Union . On the Air Force One flight back from Reykjavik , he told one about a spat between a Soviet and an American over whose country has more freedom . The American boasted that America is so free , he 'd " urinated " on the president 's car . That 's nothing , said the Soviet , I " defecated " on the general secretary 's limo . The American was amazed , and sheepishly admitted that the president was n't in the car at the time . Well , said the Soviet , to be honest I did n't take my pants off . " If Gorbachev would tell the president a joke about the Soviet system , the president would eat out of his hand , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the gulag might tickle Reagan . The place for a joke is not in the plenary sessions , but in private talks when only you two and your interpreters are in the room . You should arrange as many of these sessions as possible ? a quiet talk in Reagan 's study , a fireplace chat in the livingquarters , etc . That 's where you can make progress . After the joke , you should get right down to business . Look , Mr. President , I 've got a problem . I 'm trying to bring the Soviet Union into the 20th century , with more eco ? nomic incentives and personal freedoms , but the old guard is dead set against me . You know what it 's like to run up against a bureaucracy , do n't you ? Reagan would nod yes . I 'd like to make some of the changes the Chinese have , you should say , knowing that Reagan likes the Chinese . But I need the same ally the Chinese had ? you . Reagan is n't likely to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Reagan , you ca n't just talk . You have to perform . A conservative activist who briefed Reagan recently said he used an attention-getting gim ? mick ? a joke , a chart , a picture ? at least once a minute . What works best with Reagan is an anecdote . He made speeches for years about the Welfare Queen . You should concoct a queen of your own , perhaps the wife of a Cen ? tral Committee functionary who ca n't stay away from the special store for Party brass . Religion is another opportunity for getting in good with Reagan . The president has been briefed by author Suzanne Massie that the Russians are extremely religious , despite 70 years of rule by atheists . Christianity interests Reagan , though he 's not a churchgoer . For years , Fidel Castro has been wooing naive Americans by suggesting they were steering him back to his Catholic faith . This mesmerized Jesse Jackson when he came to Havana in 1984 . Reagan might fall for something similar from you . At the least , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptisms in the Soviet Union . Clever as you are , you ought to be able to turn the firing of Boris Yeltsin , the Moscow Party chief , to your advan ? tage . " You 've had the same kind of trouble , have n't you , Mr. President ? One of your favorite aides gets uppity and the other top staffers want him fired . You protect him as long as you can , but then he goes too far . Yeltsin actually criticized my wife , Raisa , and I could n't tolerate that . Un ? derstand my situation ? " Reagan would . So would Nancy Reagan , whom you should also culti ? vate . She 's dovish , likes arms control , and would love her husband to win a Nobel Peace Prize . In his new book , Behind the Scenes , former Reagan aide Michael Deaver writes of Nancy , " She lobbied the president to soften his line on the Soviet Union ; to reduce military spending and not to push Star Wars at the expense of the poor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House state dinner on December 8 . That 's the time to unleash the charm offensive . ONE FINAL THING . Reagan is thrilled by the idea of escorting you around prosperous , peaceful Ameri ? ca ? shopping centers , grocery stores , homes with swim ? ming pools . The president figures you will be impressed , and think better of America . Well , you ca n't let on in public that your head 's been turned . That 's bad for consumption back in the U.S.S.R. But it 's exactly what you ought to tell Reagan in private . Better yet , you should ask to stay a day or two longer so you can see more . Your cover story , of course , would be that you and Reagan are making progress in your talks . And you would be , only Reagan would n't realize that the progress consisted of his head being turned . With chummy feelings , Reagan would be primed for the big pitch . No , not a pitch to kill off Star Wars . You know he wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly small concession , namely limits on some but not all Star Wars tests . Your argument would be that you need a sym ? bolic concession to satisfy the hard-liners at home and that it would n't really impede the program . It would , though , by prolonging it . Over time , public support is bound to dwindle . And in the next administration , the president or Congress might halt the program entirely . On Afghanistan and Jewish emigration and the Berlin Wall , your best bet is a passionate plea for time . You can invoke the Vietnam analogy on Afghanistan . Remember how humiliated the United States was when it was driven out of Vietnam ignominiously , Mr. President ? To Reagan , this was a low point in American history . No superpower should have to suffer that , you would say . If I pulled the 115,000 troops out of Afghanistan in short order , I 'd have a mutiny on my hands with the Party and military brass . I 've had enough trouble persuading the generals to go along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? an unspecified number of years ? and I 'll straighten things out . You have the authority to allow thousands of Jews to emigrate . If you 're smooth in handling Reagan , you might get the United States to pay ransom , in effect , for their release . You should claim that you 'd like to let them all out , but for the objections of hard-liners , the bureaucrats , the Moscow crowd . This is a lie , but that should n't be a problem for the fellow who told Brokaw that the Russians are only in Afghanistan because they were invited . If the United States let more technology flow to the Soviet Union , that would satisfy your enemies and you 'd be able to open the emigration gate . Or so you should say . REAGAN IS READY to swoon . With so much failure in his second term , he is desperate for a happy , conflict-free summit . The White House staff and Nancy would be ecstatic . Agreement on the outline of a treaty cutting inter ? continental missiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone , Reagan wo n't hear many objections to a little concession on Star Wars . Most of his aides are willing to make big concessions . The next step would be a summit in Moscow , at which the treaty would be signed . D ? tente , and years of more American conces ? sions , would be at hand . Or almost . You have two other giants besides Reagan to appease during the Washington summit . These are CBS and ABC . They 're seething over NBC 's exclusive pre-summit interview . The solution is surrender . Give them interviews , post-summit . You have nothing to lose , and the world to gain .
