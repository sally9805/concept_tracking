A smorgasbord of morsels instead of a bold strategy <P> " The steps I describe will begin a journey toward a more productive , more competitive and more prosperous American economy . " With that promise , Jimmy Carter last week announced his $32.2 billion Economic Renewal Program . Immediately the policy provoked controversy . Asserted Congressman Clarence Brown , the Ohio Republican : " Too little , too late , too political . " Complained Murray Weidenbaum , director of Washington University 's Center for the Study of American Business : " It provides just the opposite of what the ailing economy needs . " <P> In fact , despite the fanfare with which the program was unveiled in the White House East Room , the package contains little that is new and offers no bold economic strategy for combatting the nation 's fundamental economic malady : inadequate capital investment . Above all , it does not seem to go far enough toward what is called supply-side economics , which means taking steps to stimulate more efficient output of goods and services . Instead , Carter offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for individual taxpayers and even some for advocates of an increased Government role in the economy . <P> This lack of a comprehensive strategy probably reflects the haste with which the package was assembled . With the election only ten weeks away , Carter apparently felt that he needed some " new " economic platform on which to campaign . Not only has Republican Presidential Candidate Ronald Reagan been calling for a 30% across-the-board tax reduction spread over three years , but several congressional committees have also been advocating tax slashes . <P> Not all reaction to the Carter program has been critical . Connecticut Democrat Robert Giaimo , the powerful chairman of the House Budget Committee , called it " statesmanlike . " And Walter Heller , the University of Minnesota economist , approvingly observed that it was " a carefully crafted conservative program . " One of its most commendable points is that despite its election-year timing , it contains more relief for business than for vote-casting individuals . Said Carter : " Now is no time for an excessive stimulus program nor for inflationary tax reductions . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program 's benefits for business will be worth about $15.2 billion and are intended to boost capital investment next year by 10% ; relief for individuals will total $12.4 billion . An additional $4.6 billion is to be spent in direct Government aid . In the smorgasbord of new policies are these : <P> &gt;An 8% tax credit for individuals and businesses to offset next year 's hefty jump in Social Security payroll deductions . This break would be worth $106 to a family earning $20,000 and $155 to one earning the $29,700 maximum that is to be taxed that year for Social Security . <P> &gt;A special deduction to help trim the so-called marriage penalty , a decade-old fluke in the tax tables that requires husbands and wives who both work to pay higher taxes than two unmarried wage earners living together . The change could save couples hundreds of dollars .
