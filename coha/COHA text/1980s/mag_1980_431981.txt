 | When the board of the National Organiza tion of Women voted unanimously last month not to endorse Jimmy Carter 's bid for re-election , it seemed a naive political miscalculation . NOW leaders were left to picket in the rain outside the White House while other women 's groups met inside to press their cause . White House press secretary Jody Powell cracked that Carter would try to survive " without the support of the ayatollah and NOW . " Many feminist leaders privately called the NOW decision premature ? a needless sacrifice of influence and bargaining power . Since then , however , NOW 's split with Carter has thrust the women 's movement squarely into the nomination fight between Carter and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ? and forced both of them to step up their efforts to win women 's votes in 1980 . Like other interest groups , activist wornen are trying to become a stronger force in Presidential politics . Their support this year could be crucial because , under party rules , they will account for half the delegates at the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ready to exercise some very strong political power , " says Cristine Candela , president of the 10,000-member Women 's Equity Action League . " And we have every intention of holding the candidates ' feet to the fire . " Carter himself is proud of his record on feminist issues , but activist women say he still has n't done enough ? and they are particularly angry over his opposition to Federally funded abortions for the poor and what many women see as his failure to fight for the Equal Rights Amendment , which is still three states short of ratification . " I do n't think he has moved across the room to get ERA ratified ? much less into an unratified state , " says one NOW leader . " We 're not content with lip service . " LESS THAN FINAL : At the meeting of the NOW board last month , a split developed over strategy . Some leaders worried that the dump-Carter move would destroy what bargaining power NOW still had , but agreed ? as one put it ? that Carter " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorse Kennedy right away , but were persuaded to back off. * It now appears that the split with Carter is by no means final . NEwsWEEK has learned that NOW President Eleanor Smeal said privately that " the whole picture will change if Carter decides to deliver some real action " on behalf of ERA . NOW 's move has caused other women 's groups to reassess their own strategies . Most of them have decided not to endorse any candidate now , preferring instead to elect convention delegates sympathetic to their cause ? or to lobby all delegates and candidates about feminist stands . " We 're not going to rush to attach our names to any candidate , " says Carol Silverthorn , acting executive director of the 40,000-member National Women 's Political Caucus ( NWPC ) . " We already have members in Brown 's campaign , in Carter 's and in Kennedy 's ; if they can be an influence in areas that concern us , that 's what we 're after . " Many feminists have mixed feelings about Kennedy , too . They praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERA , but some say his reputation for womanizing smacks of exploitation and nearly all complain that he has failed utterly to employ women in responsible positions over the years . Kennedy has belatedly moved to add women to his staff , recently hiring former NWPC official Joanne Howes as deputy campaign director . " It 's no secret that Senator Kennedy 's record was n't exemplary , " Howes concedes . Kennedy is also stressing anew his commitment to ERA and economic equality for women . ANATHEMA : But the more he endorses feminist views , particularly on abortion , the more trouble he is likely to have in the Iowa caucuses . The highly effective Iowa ProLife Action Council , which helped defeat Sen. Dick Clark last year , is mobilizing its supporters for the precinct voting later this month . Though anti-abortionists are not all that happy with Carter , Kennedy is positively anathema . " If Kennedy were elected President , it would set back the pro-life movement ten years , " says one anti-abortion leader . Carter , too , is stepping up his campaign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boast regularly , already named three of @#  | the six female Cabinet secretaries in U.S. history , 60 per cent of all female undersecretaries and nineteen of the 27 women ever to serve as Federal judges . He soon will appoint another woman as a Federal appeals-court judge , and he hopes to be the first President to name a woman to the Supreme Court . Senior Presidential aide Sarah Weddington has begun mailing a monthly report that touts other Carter initiatives ? from projects to help women get mortgages and loans ' to improved child-care services and socialsecurity benefits . Some activists claim that Carter 's increased attention to women is at least a partial vindication of NOW 's strategy . " I believe NOW 's action has made him take notice in a way that he would n't have otherwise , " says Candela of the Women 's Equity Action League . CONSTITUENCY : But it is not at all clear that feminists can mobilize a majority of women to vote for the candidate of their choice . If the activists were to endorse Kennedy , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that women generally are less likely than men to back Kennedy . The poll , a nationwide survey of 500 Democrats and independents conducted by The Gallup Organization for NEwsWEEK early last month , gave Carter a 39-22 edge over Kennedy . But among women , Carter 's margin widened to 39-18 , and among college-educated women ( who are more likely to vote ) , Carter led 40-14 . The results suggest that feminist leaders , like other politicos , may have to tailor their strategies to stay in front of their troops .
