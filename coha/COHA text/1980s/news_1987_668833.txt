Dear Abby : After 15 years , I am ending a friendship . Why ? Because when I go out with my " friend , " she is always short of cash , and I end up paying part or all the tab . Yesterday , my friend was short again . Would I buy the tickets for the movie so she ( who had skipped dinner ) could buy some food at the concession stand ? I paid . Then , short of money at the concession stand , would I give her a couple of dollars so she could eat ? I paid . Afterward , her car needed gas . She just sat there waiting for me to offer . I didn ' t . Her checkbook was in her " other " purse . I was outraged . Abby , this scenario has repeated itself innumerable times . Yes , I have reminded my friend of how much she owes me , but never , never has she repaid me one cent over the years . Last night was the last straw . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat her every time we were together . She earns as much as I , but she ' s always " short . " I have lost all respect for her . And from now on when she calls and asks if we can " get together " for a movie , lunch , dinner or a night out , I am going to be " busy . " Am I wrong ? Fed Up in Minneapolis Dear Fed Up : You are not wrong for being fed up with her constant freeloading . But you would be wrong to say you ' re " busy " when you ' re not . She needs to hear the truth . Tell her you are tired of picking up the tab . It might penetrate . And if it doesn ' t , you haven ' t lost anything . Dear Abby : I ' ve been married to a Chinese woman for over 15 years . I am not Chinese , and I neither speak the language nor understand it . She , on the other hand , is fluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit her . Invariably she and her Chinese friends will carry on conversations in Chinese in front of me , which I find irritating . ( They are able to speak English , but Chinese is their first language . ) I have told her it bothers me , but she still does it , so I just leave the room . Your comments , please . Left Out in Hesperia Dear Left Out : For two people to converse in Chinese , Italian , French , Spanish , German , Yiddish or Swahili in the presence of one who doesn ' t understand that language is rude . But consider this : Obviously these women prefer to visit privately , so why not leave the room with no prompting , and allow them to do so ? Dear Abby : My wife and I are in the process of having a very expensive house built in a very elite neighborhood . I usually go by our house at least once a day , coming home from work . In an average week , I will encounter five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curiosity . My question : Do I , as a future homeowner , have any rights as to keeping these intruders out of our home ? The doors have been installed , but not the locks . I can ' t be there all day , and neither can my wife . Building in Texas Dear Building : You could install the locks on the doors immediately , or put up signs : " Private property . No trespassing . Violators will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law ! " Like chicken soup , it may not do any good , but it can ' t hurt .
