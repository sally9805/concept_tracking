In all probability , the Boston College football team will be bidding adieu to the national Top 20 this week . After all , BC is an Eastern school - and an Eastern independent , at that . And to the wire-service voters , most of whom carry pictures of Woody Hayes in their wallets , Eastern independents are about as popular as socialized medicine . One tiny misstep and we ' ll see you later . Move aside for some real football teams . BC made that fatal slip Saturday in Morgantown , W. Va. , as it lost to 16th-ranked West Virginia , 20-13 . As a result , the Eagles probably have seen the last of their national rankings ( 15th in the UPI poll , 19th in the AP ) , at least for a while . If that ' s the case , it would prove an unfortunate prejudice on the part of the hardcore traditionalists . Because , if anything , Saturday ' s game emphasized the fact that BC is a viable national competitor . " I ' m going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Bicknell . " I ' m going to tell the kids that it was our first loss in five games ( the Eagles are now 3-1-1 ) , that we ' ve been on the road in four of those five games and that we ' ve played in three of the toughest places on the road ( at West Virginia , Clemson and Texas A &M); and done well . " Perhaps it is a coach ' s obligation to find sunshine at the bottom of a coal bin . But the Eagles did indeed acquit themselves admirably in Morgantown . They had apparently earned a 13-13 tie before they tripped . George Radachowsky fumbled a punt at his 13 with 1:26 remaining , West Virginia ' s Tom Bowman recovered the ball , and quarterback Jeff Hostetler finally put the Eagles away by rolling 2 yards into the end zone with 25 seconds left . " I feel bad when it comes down to a kid , " said Bicknell . " It never is a kid who ' s responsible for a win or a loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Radachowsky was a vital contributor to a defense that throttled West Virginia all afternoon despite being at a constant disadvantage , as BC ' s offense or special teams gave the ball away six times . " I think the defense is going to gain a lot of confidence from that game , " said Bicknell . " I think they ' re going to realize that they can play with the very best . They faced one of the best quarterbacks in the country and held him to under 100 yards ( Hostetler hit 11 of 29 passes for 98 yards ) . " Unfortunately for Bicknell , that same pattern applied for the Eagles . Doug Flutie , who also rates as one of the best quarterbacks in the country , suffered a horrid afternoon , completing a mere 9 of 33 passes for 122 yards , throwing four interceptions and losing a fumble . Two of his five turnovers set up West Virginia scores . " I don ' t think you can talk about the lack of offense without talking about the opposing defense , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback the way we ' ve got to . That sets up a lack of rhythm where you start to anticipate pressure that ' s not there . We had the opportunity to get some offense because we had a good running game ( 174 yards ) . So I think the offense may feel some frustration . " Now the Eagles return home to face Rutgers . And although their national aspirations may have been sidetracked , the irony is that , in the process , they may have proved once and for all they ' re legit.
