" We thought of doing a speech on the first 100 days of a Dukakis Administration . We did a speech on regional economic development instead . " <P>  --  Christopher Edley , issues director <P> The morning of the New York primary , Michael Dukakis flew back to Boston to pursue his favorite pastime : governing Massachusetts . As others sought out early exit-poll results , the Governor spent nearly two hours in his Beacon Hill office conferring with Top Advisers Hale Champion and John DeVillars . The gravity of the moment , however , was not lost on DeVillars , who was once Dukakis ' student at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government . DeVillars later marveled at the incongruity of discussing health insurance with Dukakis as it " dawns on you that a year from now this man may be sitting in the Oval Office talking about national issues . " Even then , DeVillars speculates , " you wo n't see that much change in how he approaches being President from how he 's been as Governor . " <P> Would the future flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Dukakis Administration that easy to grasp ? Would President Dukakis behave as if the U.S. were an elongated version of the Bay State ? Does Dukakis fully understand the magnitude of the difference ? <P> There is scant evidence that Dukakis has a clearly defined vision of his presidency . His disciplined , orderly mind has been understandably fixated on the task at hand  --  winning the nomination  --  and the rigors of a primary ; campaign leave little time for reflective thinking . On the few occasions that Dukakis has permitted himself to muse aloud about the White House , aides say , there was a puckish glee as he toyed with the ironies of being Governor of all the people . At a recent gubernatorial staff meeting , Dukakis joked that he imagined himself in the Oval Office telling Fred Salvucci , his current transportation secretary , that the ambitious plans to use federal funds to rebuild Boston 's central artery would have to be scaled back because " Los Angeles needs the money . " <P> As a candidate , Dukakis has drawn one indelible lesson from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding commitments . He was defeated for re-election in 1978 in part because he was forced to renounce a campaign pledge not to raise taxes . As a consequence , Dukakis has become as parsimonious with promises as Jack Benny was with dimes . <P> It is both startling and politically shrewd that Dukakis , in over a year of campaigning , is on record as making just two unalterable if-elected commitments . Neither of them loomed large on the agenda of any special- interest group , nor did they spark a passionate reaction from the voters . But they are emblematic of the mind-set that Dukakis would bring to the presidency . During a debate before the New Hampshire primary , Dukakis the righteous reformer vowed that the first bill he would send to Congress would be one limiting the influence of political-action committees . Even more characteristic is the carrot that Dukakis dangled before Iowa voters : a promise to hold the first in a series of regional economic-development conferences in Davenport in February 1989.               @ @ @ @ @ @
