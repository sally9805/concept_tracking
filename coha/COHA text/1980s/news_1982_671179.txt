The colleges , which have doubled their enrollments in the last 15 years and opened the doors to greater numbers of women and minorities than in any previous period , are reporting the first signs of economic barriers that may block the way to deserving but indigent candidates. // Such contradictory trends alarm many observers who , in recent years , have been exhorting the schools to toughen their standards and promising that such self-improvement would insure strong new public support . It now appears that even though the schools in many places have kept their side of the bargain , the rewards are lagging . In New York City , for example , fiscal austerity threatens to hit schools harder than other public services . In higher education nationwide , the elite colleges recently reported a reduction by more than a third in the number of students from low-income families in the last two years. // Harold L. Hodgkinson , a widely respected educational researcher , has published a list of impressive gains in educational quality in the December issue of the Phi Delta Kappan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a period of " deep depression " in the people ' s faith in public institutions , but hopes the schools ' improved performance will rebuild public confidence in them. // Mr. Hodgkinson , now a senior fellow at the Institute for Educational Leadership , was director of the National Institute of Education in the Ford Administration . His assessment of the schools ' recent success points to the following indicators : // - Since 1980 , students ' reading scores have showed significant increases in Atlanta , Boston , Chicago , Houston , Mineapolis , New Orleans , Newark , Philadelphia , New York City and other places . Other standardized tests also show that current elementary school children do better than their counterparts who were similarly tested in 1960. // - Gaps in performance between blacks and whites , between formerly lower-achieving pupils in the Southwest and the East and West Coasts , and between rural and urban youngsters have narrowed considerably. // - In 1970 , only 58 , 000 high school students took advanced placement tests to show they had completed college-level work ; in 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000. // - Project Headstart , President Johnson ' s effort to give preschool children from poor homes the educational and psychological advantages routinely enjoyed by middle-class youngsters , has produced measurable results . The first Headstart group is now of high-school age , and a comparison with a control group of non-Headstart youngsters with comparable backgrounds shows significant differences . Headstart graduates who are now high school sophomores score one grade level higher in reading and mathematics . Only 19 percent of the Headstart group are in classes for slow learners , compared with 39 percent in the non-Headstart group . The $6 , 000 per child invested in Headstart , Mr. Hodgkinson says , may be saving $15 , 000 per child in subsequent remedial services. // - Last year , the eight-member American team of high school students placed first among teams from 27 nations competing in the 22d international Mathematics Olympiad. // While there ' s no simple answer why the public schools have registered substantial improvements , experts cite a number of contributing factors . Outspoken and well-documented criticism of lagging efforts and low achievements put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . Stress on the basic skills became fashionable again at the very time when new research in the teaching of reading , writing and mathematics made it possible to teach more effectively. // Rediscovery of the importance of strong leadership led to the appointment of able superintendents and principals . Many teachers worked harder at improving their skills by volunteering for attendance in after-school teacher centers , many of them originally subsidized by the government . Parents and community leaders concentrated on the improvement of school discipline and attendance . The ideological rhetoric that used to downgrade academic standards and requirements has given way to concern over educational performance . Many pupils , worried about their future at a time of recession , are giving their studies a higher priority. // In view of such measurable progress , many observers are dismayed over the slow and often still hostile response from the public , and particularly from government at all levels , to the schools ' needs . The elimination of many specific Federal aid programs originally earmarked to improve the education of disadvantaged youngsters , and the submersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or block grants , is seen not only as a retreat from equal opportunity but as a new threat to educational quality. // No real solutions have been found to the critical shortage of mathematics and science teachers as business and industry gobble up the available talent at higher salaries . Mr. Hodgkinson sees hope in a renewed interest shown by industry in support of the public schools , and there have indeed been some favorable signs , as in the more than 200 adopt-a-school programs in which corporations provide financial and personnel aid. // Still , the chances are slim that recent gains can be maintained and built into a long-term educational revival , or that access to higher education can remain open without regard to economic status , unless public and legislative attitudes catch up with the new and promising educational realities before the gains are eroded and the system goes into full-scale retreat. //
