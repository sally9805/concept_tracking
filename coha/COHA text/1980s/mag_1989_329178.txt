Q. When you started out in the advice business 33 years ago , you were a square , Midwestern Jewish girl leading a life without woes . How did you relate to people with problems , and how did you find your voice ? It seems to be a mix of liberal politics and conservative morals . <P> A. And I have learned from them . But I do n't believe that you have to be a cow to know what milk is . You do n't have to have lived through an immense amount of agony and pain in order to relate to people who are suffering . I really care about what happens to people , and when I first began to read those letters , it was an eye-opener . I came from a very solid Midwestern Jewish home . You see , I led a very sheltered life . I had never seen a man hit his wife . I had never seen any drunkenness . I had never seen any poverty . I knew these things were happening , but they never happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . <P> Q. You have attributed much of your success to luck . What role does ambition play ? <P> A. I think there 's such a thing as serendipity . You have to be lucky . You have to be at the right place at the right time . But once you are lucky , you have to know what to do with your luck . And I knew what to do with my luck . <P> Q. You are tremendously driven , and I wonder how much of that results from being the twin sister of Dear Abby ? <P> A. Competitiveness is a factor , I 'm sure , as with all siblings . But I was the first one to go into this work , and the drive was there from day one . <P> Q. Do you read most of the letters you receive every day ? Do you read 100 at a sitting ? <P> A. Oh , yes . Reading those letters is a very important part of doing the job , because selecting the letters is the lifeblood of that column . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no good . I must be alone when I read . <P> Q. When you started out , you hesitated to mention the word sex , but now . . . <P> A. Hesitated ? I printed a letter on homosexuality the first year that I was writing the column , and the publisher in St. Joe , Mich. , let us know that he was not running that column . He printed a box on Page One saying there would be no Ann Landers column today because she 's dealing with a subject that we feel is not fit for a family newspaper . Of course , everybody in town ran to buy the Detroit Free Press to see what it was that Ann Landers was talking about that the paper would n't print . <P> Q. Your candor can not endear you to right-wingers . <P> A. You are right on . They say you can judge a man 's value by his enemies . I have an interesting assortment . The National Rifle Association , pro-lifers , the animal-rights people . For years I have fought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact . I have taken a strong stand against the church or state telling women what they can and can not do with their bodies . We need animal models ( ( for experiments ) ) , and I 've been fighting this battle for years . It gets tougher and tougher . The animal-rights people are powerful and rich . <P> Q. A wide range of subjects provokes intense feelings among your readers . What is it about toilet paper , for instance , that prompted more than 15,000 letters ?
