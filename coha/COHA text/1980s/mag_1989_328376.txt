In two prior contests to fill House vacancies that had cropped up since George Bush won the White House , the G.O.P. had come up embarrassingly empty-handed . <P> Since Wyoming had not elected a Democrat to Congress since 1976 , a Thomas defeat would have been especially painful for the G.O.P. The high symbolic stakes made for a vituperative campaign . Thomas ' supporters spread a false rumor that his Democratic opponent , State Senator John Vinich , had filed a falsified report about an automobile accident . Vinich may have blown the race with exaggerated ads accusing the Republican of being soft on crime . <P> Having finally won one , Republican leaders insist that the momentum from Thomas ' victory will help them regain control of the House in 1990 . But the % Democrats ' 260-to-175 advantage among incumbents seeking re-election , more than 90% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hollow claim .
