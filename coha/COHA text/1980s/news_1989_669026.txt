Major U.S. airlines intensified a fare war Monday , extending reductions for summer travel into the historically weak fall season . Trans World Airlines started the move on Sunday , announcing it was cutting roundtrip fares by as much as $160 to lure passengers in the fall . The reductions were matched Monday by Pan Am Corp . , USAir Group Inc . , United Airlines , Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines in markets where they compete with TWA . American Airlines , the nation ' s largest carrier , went one better by matching the cuts for all the mainland U.S. cities it serves , not only those where it competes with TWA . Spokesman Jim Brown in Dallas said American would match TWA ' s new fares to Europe on a competitive basis . Pan Am did the same for international routes , cutting fares across its entire overseas network except for the Soviet Union , said spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners in New York . Jim Lundy , a spokesman for Delta Air Lines , said the Atlanta-based carrier was still studying the issue and expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Sept. 1 for domestic flights from Sept. 9 to Dec. 15 and for international flights from Oct. 1 to May 21 . Air fares had been steadily rising in recent months amid strong passenger traffic and may have peaked for awhile , industry analysts say . Continental started a round of cuts on Aug. 2 when it reduced to $75 each way its weekend fares through Labor Day on most nonstops , and lowered transcontinental fares to $100 each way . An unusual arrangement in the latest fare-cutting allows one change in travel dates . Discount fares normally prohibit such changes . In addition , a " lowest fare guarantee " ensures that if the fares are reduced further after a ticket is purchased , passengers will be refunded the difference . " TWA wants to stimulate traffic during the historically weak fall travel period , and passengers who act now will be getting a great deal , " Robert Cozzi , TWA ' s senior vice president of marketing , said in a statement . The offer covers more than 100 cities worldwide , he said . Examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wednesday are : St. Louis-Dallas , $148 ; New York-Los Angeles , $198 ; Chicago-Denver , $168 ; and San Antonio-Washington , $198 . Passengers must stay over on a Saturday night and tickets can not be refunded . The discounts are not available for domestic travel on Nov. 21 , 22 , 26 or 27 , which ordinarily are heavy travel days for the Thanksgiving holiday . Roundtrip fares to Europe have been cut by about $100 . Examples of one-way fares from New York on TWA starting Nov. 1 are London , $149 ; Paris , $199 ; Frankfurt , West Germany , $189 ; Madrid , $213 ; and Rome , $232 . International tickets must be purchased 30 days in advance and passengers must stay a minimum of seven days and a maximum of 21 . The discounts are not available from March 22 through April 21 . Some foreign governments could balk at approving the duration of the new international fares , since they are described as fall discounts but extend through May 21 , said some industry sources .
