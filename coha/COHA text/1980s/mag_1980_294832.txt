British show on brain death angers doctors , upsets public <P> In Coma , the bestselling novel that became a hit movie , greedy physicians have a nifty racket going : in order to acquire valuable organs for transplant surgery , they slip patients into unconsciousness , then declare them irreversibly braindamaged . If a recent television program in Britain were to be believed , Coma is not so far off the mark . The show , part of the BBC 'S Panorama program , asked the question Transplants : Are the Donors Really Dead ? The shocking answer : maybe not . <P> Panorama arrived at its conclusion after examining methods used by doctors to determine " brain death . " The concept holds that a person is dead when the brain has permanently stopped functioning ; the heart and lungs can be kept going by machines . In Britain , doctors must figure out what caused the patient 's condition-say , a blow to the head-and then do an extensive series of tests . Among them : shining light into the eyes to see if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check whether the eyes react by quivering . In the U.S. , physicians also often do an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) to confirm that there is no brain activity . <P> The program suggests that the brain-death criteria , particularly in Britain , are not strict enough and intimates that a factor may be the need for healthy organs for transplants . To buttress the show 's argument , the producers described the experiences of five American patients who were thought dead but who survived . Only one was ever considered as a possible organ donor . Two were women who had taken drug overdoses , one was a premature infant , another was a man paralyzed by a muscle-relaxing agent . The most sensational case was that of a man who lost consciousness after suffering a heart attack . He was saved only when the transplant surgeon , who was about to remove the kidneys , noticed a bobbing Adam 's apple . <P> Doctors in Britain , including Neurologist Bryan Jennett and Surgeon Robert Sells , who were interviewed on the program , are crying foul . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , with some justice , that the show distorted facts . They point out that brain-death codes were set up not to ease transplants but to spare families draining bedside vigils . Says Jennett : " Only one in eight or nine patients taken off respirators ever becomes a donor . " <P> As for the American patients , none could have been declared brain dead by the criteria set up in British or American codes . Doctors must first exclude certain conditions such as drug overdoses , which may mimic death but are reversible . Indeed , there is some confusion over the American cases cited . Neurologist Fred Plum of New York Hospital , who was interviewed for the program , stresses that the patient he discussed was never officially declared brain dead . <P> The use of the EEG , which Panorama pushed , is also controversial . Doctors note that people who are alive can have a flat EEG , suggesting no brain activity . Moreover , even inanimate matter can appear to have life . A doctor once wired a plate of Jell-O in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the electrodes picked up impulses from equipment in the room . Says Plum : " EEGS are done more as a reassuring step to doctor and family than because they are any more foolproof than good clinical observation . "
