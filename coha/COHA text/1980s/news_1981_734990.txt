txt A side dish of sauce is slicker , but salt is quicker By Pierre Franey am fascinated by the various condiments or side dishes served with a dish . In Italy , if you have a bollito misto , you almost always get a small service of mustard fruit on the side , a great food association . Among the most curious of side dishes is coarse salt . I was reminded of the use of salt as an accompaniment when I dined with Virginia Lee , the well-known Chinese cooking authority . She served a fantastic platter of fried squab , and as an accompaniment , small dishes of salt seasoned with crushed Szechwan peppercorns , plus wedges of lemon . The seasoned salt gave a complementary flavor to the roasted pigeons ( squab ) . I RECENTLY decided to use that same seasoning salt as an accompaniment for broiled sqttab prepared in my kitchen , I decided that broling would be much simpler than deep frying as Mrs. Lee had done .
