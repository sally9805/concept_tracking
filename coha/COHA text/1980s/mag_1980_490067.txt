THE construction of the Gateway Arch was a project that never had my approval . When it was completed , in 1965 ? a six-hundred  --  thirty-foot arch next to downtown St. Louis to commemorate the west  --  ward expansion of the United States  --  I made no secret of my resentment . I pointed out to anyone who would listen what seemed to be a rather significant flaw in the reasoning of those who had persuaded the federal . government to spend some thirty mil  --  lion dollars on a monument identifying St. Louis as the Gateway to the West  --  the fact that the Gateway to the West happened to he Kansas City . I suppose the people who thought a gateway arch might look nice on the west bank of the Mississippi at St. Louis considered the fact that they were more than two hundred miles from the true gateway a trifling de  --  tail  --  something that could he planned around without much difficulty , the way a Corps of Engineers dam-and  --  reservoir project sometimes plans around the absence of a river  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance , I was born and raised in Kansas City , and I grew up secure in the knowledge that I was living in the Gateway to the West , not to speak of the Heart of America . Having previously had no reason to think of the residents of St. Louis as anything other than fair-minded Americans , I was naturally dis  --  tressed to find that they were not able to respond with any graciousness at all to my suggestion as to how the error might be rectified in an equitable man  --  ner  --  by changing the name of the arch or moving it to Kansas City . I discov  --  ered that the mere mention of which Missouri city had for years been known far and wide as the Gateway to the West set St. Louis people off on pain  --  fully long recitations about French fur-trading settlements or the expedition of Lewis and Clark . Details about which sort of foreigners traded furs in the Mississippi Valley could not be ex  --  pected to mean much to someone who purchased his first football at Gateway Sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri , the Gateway to the - West . Under the circumstances , I ad  --  mit , I may have been ungracious enough myself to ask my friends in St. Louis some questions that were meant to embarrass rather than to elicit in  --  formation . If St. Louis was the Gate  --  way to the West , I asked , why had it for so many years seemed content to call itself the Mound City ? Why , years after the mound in question had been eroded away or condemned for urban renewal or made into a parking lot , did the St. Louis telephone directory abound with outfits like Mound City Cartage and Mound City Obedience Training Club and Mound City Shelled Nuts ? Might an appropriate name for the monument the federal government had wrought for St. Louis with my tax money he the Mound Arch ? As a good citizen , I naturally tried to make my peace with the Gateway Arch in the years after its completion , despite having been handed a second bitter pill to swallow  --  the decision of my home town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart of America  --  the title we had left after an act of the federal government official  --  ly moved the Gateway east  --  sound  --  ed too folksy for a gang of boosters who had a brief fling in the early sev  --  enties at trying to transform the town into what they called " a glamour city . " When I go home these days , I am told that Kansas City has more fountains than Rome , Italy . It is the sort of statistic that strikes me the way Okla  --  homa 's new boast of having more miles of lakefront than Minnesota must strike some rancher who has spent his life on the Oklahoma prairies : May  --  be , but it sure do n't show . The foun  --  tains represent an additional irritant to me personally because nobody in au  --  thority in Kansas City has ever so much as acknowledged my suggestion that two or three of them he disman  --  tled so that the material can he used for a statue to Henry Perry , the man who brought barbecue to town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has ever tried to get a decent plate of barbecue in Rome , Italy . What I am acknowl  --  edging is that my effort to purge myself of bias against the Gateway Arch has not been free of complica  --  tions . When I decided recently to give the Arch the benefit of a closer look  --  fair is fair  --  I did so with the realiza  --  tion that I would he going to the top of it carrying some heavy personal baggage . THE question of where the West begins is not simply a matter of civic pride . Over the past several years , there has been a growing interest in regionalism  --  which , like ethnicity , pro  --  vides a way of seeing various groups of Americans as distinctive rather than the same  --  and the overriding concern of regionalism has always been where to draw the lines . Academic regional  --  ists are ingenious line-drawers . Wilbur Zelinsky , of Pennsylvania State Uni  --  versity , who is one of the country 's foremost regionalists , has devised a " doctrine of first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to , say . the South or the Midwest depending on whether its dominant culture was handed down by settlers from upstate New York or from the hills of Ten  --  nessee . Trying to decide where re  --  gional boundaries belong , regionalists can draw conclusions from data like a state 's political-party registration and the sorts of first names its citizens tend to give their children . One of their favorite documents is a map of the United States colored in county-by  --  county to indicate the dominant re  --  ligion  --  showing red for Catholicism in the Southwest and Northeast cor  --  ners and a solid block of Baptist blue in the South and Methodist yellow sprinkled through the Midwest and Lutheran green approaching from the North and a great blob of Mormon gray spilling out of Utah into Idaho and Nevada . Zeiinsky once tried to an  --  swer the question of where the South ends by taking a horse-mule census within the territory in doubt  --  the the  --  ory being that farmers who used mules to pull their plows obviously lived in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to remain beyond even the sop histicated line-drawing techniques of the modern regionalist : Nobody has ever really figured out what to do about Missouri . Sonic hint of the sort of frustration Missouri presents to regionalists may be provided by the fact that the most distinc  --  tive area of the state between St. Louis on the east and Kansas City on the west is known for being nei  --  ther Eastern nor West  --  ern but Southern  --  a section called Little Dixie , where the Dem  --  ocrats are Southern Democrats and the feeling against govern  --  ment interference is so strong , I was once told , that some people are philosophically opposed to parking meters . Although Raymond D. Gastil , in " Cultural Re  --  gions of the United States , " acknowl  --  edges that a 1940 study described Mis  --  souri as having less in common cul  --  turally with Arkansas than N.vtli its neighboring states to the east and west and north , he concludes that most of the state is part of the South . The first effective settlement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Bap  --  tist-blue counties push up toward the Iowa line . ( " Wherever there are Southern Baptists there is Southern culture . " ) Gastil also includes the en  --  tire state in his discussion of the Cen  --  tral Midwest ( " Much of what the world thinks of as ' American ' is Mid  --  western and especially Central Mid  --  western " ) , and mentions that another regionalist has found it to he part of the Southwest . It is not at all unusual for a regionalist to consider Missouri a part of two or three regions . When regionalists divide up the country with  --  out strict regard for state lines , the re  --  gional boundaries almost always sweep right through Missouri . The Arch planners , apparently not realizing that the state of Missouri defies being categorized as anything at all , may have thought St. Louis was the first city of the West simply be cause it happens to be the last city of the East . In history and culture and atmosphere , it has a lot more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does with plates like Kansas City or Omaha or Dallas . The next city west , Kansas City , did not celebrate its cen tennial until after the Second World War . St. Louis has an eighteenth-cen tury history  --  an eighteenth-century history that has to be pumped up a bit with French fur-trading stories , it 's true , but still an eighteenth-century history . Although St. Louis grew up on the west hank rather than the east hank of the river for some reason ? proximity to the mound , perhaps  --  it was an established city at a time when the United States was basically a country bounded by the Atlan tic Ocean on the east and the Mississippi Riv er on the west . A cen ter for shoe factories and breweries early in this century , it was in dustrialized at a time when the cities west of it were still tied to the land . It is the western most city with large , entrenched European-immigrant neigh borhoods ; it is still possible to hear someone described as being " St. Louis Italian " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Irish . " It has an East ern city 's way of disdaining boosterism and celebrating the past . ( " It is difficult to say when St. Louis was at its great est , " the St. Louis Globe-Democrat 's business editor wrote a few years ago . " During the 1880s , when she served as the Gateway to the West , or in 1904 , when the world came here to attend the Great Fair . " ) If it were n't for the Arch , the image that might flash into people 's minds at the mention of St. Louis is the picture of the Pruitt-Igoe public-housing project being dyna  --  mited by the authorities in charge of it  --  an instant symbol of the frustra  --  tions involved in trying to solve the economic and social problems of what are sometimes referred to as " the crumbling industrial cities of the Northeast . " St. Louis meets the tests I devised several years ago to identify an Eastern city : a place where nobody on the city council ever wears white patent-leather shoes , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Western city has one place , usually called something Iike the New York Delicatessen ) , and where just about everybody eats supper after dark and calls it dinner . Considering the response some years ago to my suggestion that some consideration he given to moving a single six-hundred-thirty-foot arch to a more appropriate site , I almost hesi  --  tate to mention what would make it possible to draw the regional boundaries of the East in a tidier and more order  --  ly manner : St. Louis belongs on the other side of the river . When I try to think of ways to group American cities  --  which I often do , inspired , no doubt , by the ingenui  --  ty of Professor Zelinsky 's horse-mule census  --  I divide the Old United States from what has followed by distinguish  --  ing between cities that had major-league baseball teams before the Sec  --  ond World War and those that did not . Tr , me , the towering figure in pre-expansionist America is not Thom  --  as Jefferson , the third President of the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er of baseball . At the start of the war , of course , St. Louis , the southwest cor  --  ner of the United States as defined by Judge Landis , had not just the Car  --  dinals but the St. Louis Browns  --  a chronically hapless outfit that made possible the popular description of the Mound City as " first in shoes , first in booze , and last in the American League . " The people who run cities that were in the major leagues at the start of the war make some assump  --  tions that are often not made in cities that now have expansion teams or no teams at all  --  that a large American city has a symphony orchestra as a matter of course , for instance , or that everyone has a policy about whether or not he is willing to cross a picket line , or that it is admirable ( rather than sissified or regionally disloyal ) to attend Harvard . A lot of what has happened in American cities in the past ten or fifteen years that seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the international airports , the domed stadia , and , of course , the des  --  perate scrambling for big-Ieague fran  --  chises in at least four sports  --  has hap  --  pened mainly in cities that are south or west of where the majors traditionally ended . It is true that the downtown powers of St. Louis managed to acquire the largest civic status symbol of all , but it took them thirty years to do it  --  the first serious effort to develop the riverfront where the Gateway Arch now stands having begun in 1934 . Among boosters in an expansion-team city like Houston , that is not a pace that would qualify for inclusion in the cate  --  gory of human progress . TN St. Louis , the Gateway Arch is generally considered a success . It has given Sr. Louis an identifying sym  --  bol in the way Paris has the Eiffel Tower and San Francisco the Golden Gate Bridge  --  and it is a symbol that makes a considerably more appealing logo than , say , an artist 's rendition of Pruitt-Igoe self-destructing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown that it was presumably designed to anchor having drifted out into the county by the time the Arch was completed . It draws more tourists than any other man-made attraction in the United States that is not owned by Walt Dis  --  ney Productions -- a particularly impor  --  tant achievement in a state whose tra  --  ditional difficulty in presenting itself as a tourist destination rather than a place to hurry through can be gauged from the fact that a recent guidebook is titled " Pause in Missouri . " A lot of St. Louis residents are enamored of the Arch as a technological achievement ; I was mesmerized one evening by a citizen 's description of how the great legs of the Arch were pulled apart at the top , the final section put into place by a giant derrick , and the Iegs allowed to snap hack together . A lot of St. Louis resi  --  dents simply think the Gateway Arch is staggeringly , inspiringly beautiful . " Have you seen it ? " I was often asked while I was in St. Louis . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you actually been out there , and gone to the top ? " " Not exactly . But I really mean to get out there before I leave . " I really did mean to get out there . I told myself that the hesitancy was simply a matter of caution , since it is well known that a structure designed as a civic symbol can be judged truly accepted as such only when a number ' of citizens start jumping off of it . I would n't think much about sailing un  --  der the Bay Bridge in San Francisco , but passing under the Golden Gate would stake me feel like a Londoner I during the blitz . My friends in St. Louis assured me , though , that ap  --  proaching the Gateway Arch is per  --  fectly safe : there is no way to reach the top except from the inside , and the windows are permanently locked . Finally , I decided that fairness re  --  quired a visit to the Arch . I drove toward what is officially known as the Jefferson National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the downtown skyline as I approached , I had to admit that it is an impressive structure  --  a clean , sparkling , stainless-steel loop rising from the river .
