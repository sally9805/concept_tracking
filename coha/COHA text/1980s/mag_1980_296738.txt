If the the kids ca n't read , what is the use of library books ? " harrumphed California 's aging ( 77 ) grinch , Howard Jarvis . An interesting question , but not much of an argument for Proposition 9 , Jarvis ' new plan to cut state personal income taxes in half . Two years ago Californians rousingly approved Jarvis ' Proposition 13 to cut real estate taxes an average of 57% . This time his tax-cutting plan met strong opposition from civil service unions and other civic organizations , which argued that it would benefit the rich and cut government services to the poor . Result : Californians last week voted down Prop . 9 by 61% to 39% . Does this mean the tax revolt is over ? Not likely . Noting that Californians had enjoyed $26 billion in tax reductions over three years , Governor Jerry Brown declared , " This is not the end of the tax revolt . It 's a pause .
