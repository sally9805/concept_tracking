The charges against Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards , 58 , and seven of his associates , including a brother and a nephew , fill 53 pages crammed with 50 counts of racketeering , fraud and obstruction of justice . U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr . needed one hour and 15 minutes just to read the allegations in New Orleans last week . All told , the trial could go on for two months and entail the examination of up to 80 witnesses . Even before the proceedings began , each of the jurors was sandbagged with five fat folders , 2 in. to 3 in. thick and packed with pertinent documents . So it was with some skepticism that the six men and six women greeted Federal Prosecutor John Volz 's attempt to offer them some blithe assurance . Said he : " This is not a complicated case . " <P> What the Government intends to prove , Volz declared , is that the defendants used lying , bribery and influence peddling to obtain valuable state certification for phony hospital and nursing- home corporations , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that the alleged caper involved some " complex shenanigans . " <P> Complexity should be one of the few aspects of the case that will not be disputed by the 15 defense lawyers . The defense insists that Edwards took part in a legitimate business enterprise launched while he was a private lawyer and concluded last year , before he became Governor for the third time . The $2 million Edwards received , his advocates say , was for legal services . <P> The prosecution argues that Edwards did nothing to earn legal fees and that the money was , in part , advance payments for actions he later took as Governor to benefit his partners . After Edwards regained office , Volz insisted , his brother Marion acted as " bagman " to hold Edwards ' share of the resulting profits . Said Volz : " Marion Edwards did not do a lick of work , yet he walked away with $1 million . " Beyond routine greed , Volz declared , the Governor had a pressing need for money : some $800,000 in Las Vegas gambling debts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wagering and women , the Governor glanced about the courtroom and grinned when the prosecutor spoke of his " staggering " gaming debts . Later he said he was more optimistic than ever about beating the rap . Only the sixth sitting Governor in this century to be indicted , * Edwards , despite being on trial four days a week , continues to run the state . <P> FOOTNOTE : *The other five : Indiana 's Warren McCray ( 1923 ) and Ed Jackson ( 1927 ) ; North Dakota 's William Langer ( 1934 ) ; Maryland 's Marvin Mandel ( 1975 ) ; West Virginia 's Arch Moore Jr . ( 1975 ) .
