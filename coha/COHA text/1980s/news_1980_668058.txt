" I can play at my level every day , and that level is usually five levels above anybody else . I think I ' ll dominate racquetball for another five years . " - Marty Hogan , No. 1-ranked player " He can say that , but I know I got it . " - Dave Peck , No. 2-ranked player It isn ' t a streetfight . . . yet . It ' s just one of the most confident athletes ever to put on a game face talking about his abilities and a responsefrom the man who is chasing him . This week the two could face off in Beverly at the $15,000 Seamco Classic , which continues today through Sunday at the Playoff-Handball Racquetball Club . Marty Hogan grew up in St. Louis and hung around the Jewish Community Center where his mother was a locker-room attendant . Not unlike what Gloria Connors did for Jimmy , Goldie Hogan did for Marty . She was , and always has been , his only coach . " I played football and baseball , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was 8 . I loved it . By the time I was 15 , I knew I wanted to be a pro . I worked in a hamburger joint to make travel money so I could play in places like Chicago and Milwaukee . " In 1975 , he lost a first-round match to Vic Niederhoffer in the nationals , so he left St. Louis for San Diego where he could play the game every day , sometimes for four or five hours . In the final of 1976 , five-time national champion Charlie Brumfield beat Hogan ; the year after , it was David Bledsoe . In 1978 , the setting was Hogan against Brumfield again . By this time , Hogan had taken to calling himself " Killer Dog " - and he announced that he would " annihilate Brumfield . " Hogan , with a kill from deep in the backcourt ( the shot that made him famous ) , beat Brumfield and took home the $7000 first-place check . In Hogan ' s words : " I believe I am improving every time I play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In four years on the tour , he has won 28 of 33 tournaments . Last year alone , Hogan made $250,000 . " But it isn ' t the money , " he says , dismissing his 40-acre estate in San Diego , the condominium In Utah and the endorsements from Adidas , Leach Industries , K-Mart , Vitalis and Champion gloves . " I love this game . I love a sport where you rely on yourself . " Dave Peck , built slightly larger than Hogan at 5 feet 10 , 190 , played football until five years ago , when he turned 18 . Following a season of " being crushed by huge linemen " at Texas-El Paso , Peck took up racquetball . Last year he was named rookie of the year , this year he is ranked right behind Hogan . " I honestly feel I can catch him , " says Peck , " even though I ' ve lost the three times we ' ve played . The last went to a tiebreaker . I think I can beat him now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color that Hogan ' s appear to be , but they are certainly respectable . Since November , Peck has finished second or first in every tournament he ' s entered , losing only to Hogan . He has avoided the master , though , in the two pro stops Peck won . In Memphis , Bledsoe beat Hogan in the semis and Peck beat Bledsoe in the final . And Hogan skipped San Francisco . " To be honest , Marty is the best there is right now , " Peck says . " He has outstanding shot selection and is a tremendous athlete . But my attitude is changing . I ' m not intimidated anymore . " Hogan ' s version of psychological intimidation has taken on various forms . In his first tournament victory ever , over Steve Serot in 1975 , Hogan is said to have screamed , " You ' re a C ' player , " at Serot , which is not unlike being called a total drone . One time he cursed David Bledsoe ; another time he called his opponent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smashing his $150 Graphite racquet ( " the least of my worries " ) , and his erratic behavior earned him the nickname " Hogan the Hooligan . " This year , Racquet magazine named him one of the " 10 worst performers of the racquet stage , " placing him ahead of Billie Jean King and Clark Graebner on the all-churlish list . But , by most accounts , that image of Hogan is timeworn and not true anymore . The primal screams and crazed expressions have all but disappeared . Even Peck ' s agent , Jerry Day , says Hogan is a gentleman . " I ' ve seen him mad , " Day says , " but never out of control . Marty ' s just aggressive ; he doesn ' t throw tantrums . " Bledsoe calls the intemperate behavior , " Marty ' s great will to win " and says that he is a fair competitor . Brumfield says he ' s simply " loose and confident . " Hogan has always been that way , a larger-than-life production . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he was 17 , he was " ordering from the left " without any regard to cost . And he didn ' t make a public show when he started to make the money . A marketing major at San Diego State ( courtesy of a Leach Industries scholarship ) , Hogan took an accounting course last year . Little was made of his financial status . The professor , in fact , had no idea who Hogan was . " He told us that a top graduate could make $25,000 the first year , " Hogan says . " By then , I had made $200,000 . " Hogan says his ability justifies the money he banks . A natural athlete ( third in the Superstars competition ) , Hogan is a power hitter with great timing . His serve , clocked at 142 mph , is 20 mph faster than the best of his opponents . The game used to be one of finesse . Hogan changed it to one of power . His wristy , bullwhip stroke and huge backswing make him exciting to watch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyable . And it is not uncommon for Hogan to scream at himself during a match . " Do something with the ball , Marty ; you smell , " he has said , and often he ' ll swear at himself in anger . " Marty is a showman , " says Peck , " and he is almost always geared up to play . You have to fight that . In our last match , the tiebreaker , Marty beat me 11-0 - a donut . ' When I went home to Texas , everybody started calling me Dunkin . ' To beat Marty , you can ' t let his psyche control you . " Charlie Brumfield has developed his own mental program for tournament preparation . " There are three methods , " Brumfield says . " First , you must develop a firm artificial hatred of your opponent . It raises your level of desire . Second , you should psych yourself up with music . I use Gone at Last ' by Paul Simon . It has a fast beat . " And third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a song , get a Dumbo ' s Feather . Remember him ? Dumbo didn ' t think he could fly until a friend gave him a magic ' feather . Everyone can do or find something lucky to help him get in the right frame of mind . " Brumfield is one of the many who have tried to knock down Hogan , but they just can ' t seem to pull the championship ring off his finger . Hogan has even been quoted as saying , " I can ace them anytime I want to . " " That ' s a misquote , " Hogan says now . " But I think I can dominate play when I want to . My stroke is the best in the game . I know that sounds cocky , but it ' s true . Anybody who plays now copies my stroke . " It sounds much more brisk and forceful than it is . Hogan is cocky , but he is also appealing . Just ask him about women from here to San Diego . " There are groupies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re out there . It just depends how you want to handle it . " Hogan does not say . But he vehemently denies the quote attributed to him in People magazine last year : " I ' m ridin ' high , cruisin ' , layin ' on the beach , lookin ' for broads . " " I don ' t think I ' ve ever used the word broad ' , " Hogan says . On the road , in fact , he tries to educate himself , with interests that run from reading Time magazine to watching the St. Louis Blues . One day he ' d like to work with animals . " But not for another six or seven years , " Hogan says . " And by then , no one will be able to duplicate my record . " Dave Peck , for one , will try to move up his retirement date . " If Marty Hogan honestly thinks he ' ll be on top for the next five years , good luck to him , " says Peck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
