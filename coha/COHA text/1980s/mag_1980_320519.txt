These gentle , easy-to-perform exercises are among the most common recommended by doctors and physical therapists as insurance against the miseries of backache . They include a series of squats on tiptoe while holding a chair for balance ; sit-ups that include touching the toes ; pushing forward as far as possible on a bent knee ; curling forward while seated in a chair ; and tucking knees to chest while lying flat on the back . Their purpose : to firm up the various muscles , such as those of the abdomen , chest and hips , that support the spine ; only a few minutes of daily exercising should suffice . The movements may be uncomfortable at first , and each exercise should be repeated only two or three times when starting out such a program . If there is any pain , the exercising should be halted . But as the muscles stretch and strengthen , the routine should become more natural , if not actually fun .                  @ @ @
