Living as we are through the greatest global democratic awakening in history , it is hard not to feel the thrill Wordsworth felt when contemplating the French Revolution ( " Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive/ But to be young was very heaven ! " ) . Of course Wordsworth lived to regret it . But there will be time for that later . Now is the time to thrill . <P> At the stunning uprising in China , of course . But it is only the latest event in the democratic demarche , which began with the Philippines and Korea and has now reached wondrous proportions . <P>  --  In Lithuania the Soviet-installed , Communist-controlled , erstwhile puppet parliament votes for independence from the Soviet Union . <P>  --  In Hungary the two wings of the Communist Party are fighting over whether upcoming multiparty elections mean the Communists will be voted out of power in six years ( the hard-line position ) or sooner ( the moderate position ) . <P>  --  Argentina is about to witness the first transition of power from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by electing a Peronist , the Argentines have proved once again that democracy is a people 's license to act stupidly . <P>  --  In Chile a 15-year-old dictatorship holds a referendum on itself and loses , proving once again that democracy is a people 's license to act enlightened . <P>  --  Poland will not only hold free elections for the upper house of parliament this month but , in a little noted provision of its pact with Solidarity , will also have a popular election for President in six years . <P> With such goings-on , it 's hard not to get gushy and to feel it a privilege to have lived to witness such a dawn . <P> I admit to feeling a gush or two of Wordsworthian euphoria . Though a drawing of Yuri Andropov graces my office wall ( a warm reminder of the good old days when The Enemy looked the part ) , I am a cold warrior who does not mourn the passing of the great twilight struggle . The cold war made thinking simpler in a " four legs good , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of way . But simpler does n't mean better . There could be no happier outcome for the cold war than for us to win it and for old cold warriors to face the invigorating challenge of rethinking from the ground up what America 's role in the world , if any , ought to be . <P> But some of the gushing is getting out of hand . The most common bit of mush , endlessly repeated , whether the reporting is from China or the Soviet Union or Lithuania , is that once the genie of freedom is out of the bottle it can never be put back in . This is rank sentimentalism . The idea that somehow , if people ) have tasted freedom , the taste can not be wrung out of them is a fallacy so large it is embarrassing just to hear it . Think only of this century . Russia tasted freedom in February 1917 and by October had lost it for 70 years . Weimar Germany tasted democracy for 14 years ; it took Hitler and his storm troopers a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II , the taste might to this day not have returned . ) Hungarians let the genie out in 1956 ; five days and 5,000 tanks later , Khrushchev had stuffed it back in . Twenty-one years ago , the Czechs tasted freedom for an afternoon . Tell the Czechs that today 's " Moscow Spring " is irreversible . Nothing is irreversible .
