Thatcher exults , Galtieri falls and Reagan faces Latin anger <P> " Today has put the Great back in Britain . " So said an exultant Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last week as she greeted the euphoric crowd that had gathered outside 10 Downing Street , cheering and singing Rule Britannia , to celebrate Britain 's victory in the ten-week war for the Falkland Islands . An emotional Thatcher shook hand after hand , and declared , " This is a great vindication of everything we have done . It proves that everything that we thought was right . What a night this has been for Britain ! What a wonderful victory ! " <P> So it was . But hardly had the white flags of surrender been hoisted over the island capital of Port Stanley when a set of new , potentially more formidable problems emerged . Three days after Britain 's triumph , Argentina 's top generals ousted President Leopoldo Fortunate Galtieri . He was temporarily replaced as President by yet another general , Interior Minister Alfredo Oscar Saint Jean , and as army chief by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal from power : " I am going because the army did not give me the political support to continue . " In fact , Galtieri 's fall may have been hastened by crowds of a very different sort from those that greeted Thatcher . Frustrated and angry at their country 's defeat , some 5,000 Argentines had gathered in the Plaza de Mayo in central Buenos Aires , throwing coins at the President 's palace to symbolize a " sellout " surrender , and chanting , " Galtieri to the wall ! " It was one of the worst displays of public discontent since 1976 . For those who experienced the chaos of that earlier , turbulent era , the demonstration was a reminder of the volatility that has marred so much of Argentina 's history , and once led to the kind of nationalistic populism that was the hallmark of the late dictator Juan Domingo Pern . <P> At week 's end Argentina 's leaders still refused to admit military defeat . Clinging to the position that had doomed all efforts at a negotiated settlement before the guns were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their claim to sovereignty over the Falklands be negotiated as part of any settlement . Buenos Aires warned that any cease-fire in the Falklands would be " precarious " so long as British forces remained on the islands . While the Argentines seemed willing to suspend hostilities for the moment , they left open the possibility of further fighting . If the fragile cease-fire broke down , the conflict could easily escalate into a new and possibly even more violent confrontation , since the British have not ruled out the possibility of answering additional attacks with the bombing of Argentine airbases and the mining of Argentine harbors.
