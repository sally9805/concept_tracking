While Democrats took the lead in pushing the proposals , sizable numbers of Republicans in both chambers defied White House pressure and voted for what Larry Speakes , the President ' s spokesman , called " budget busting " measures . The votes came after weeks of increasingly urgent concern about the farm crisis on Capitol Hill and an influx of hundreds of lobbyists from Middle Western states pleading for immediate aid to the Farm Belt. // Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , one of eight Republican Senators to defect from the party line today , explained his vote his way : " There is a disaster out there in agriculture . I can ' t turn my back on the farmers without turning my back on 7 out of 10 people in my state whose jobs are directly related to agriculture. " // // // Farmers Rally in Iowa // Thousands of farmers who rallied today in Senator Grassley ' s home state reserved their loudest cheers for attacks on officials of the Administration and demands for policy changes to ease their debt burdens and raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Coleman , a Missouri Republican who co-sponsored the legislation adopted in the House today , said the White House had made " somewhat of a political mistake " by opposing the aid measures . " Congress is up for re-election , " he noted , " and we look through different political eyes than the White House. " // Democrats see the farm issue as their first chance in the new Congress to score political points against President Reagan and to dramatize their argument that Administration policies are unfair to middle-class Americans. // Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. , the Speaker of the House , told a press briefing today , " I look at it as the old coalition of the old Democratic Party coming together when one segment of the economy is in a desperate plight. " // At the White House , Mr. Speakes counterattacked , saying , " What ' s happened is the Democrats cried ' deficit ' throughout the campaign all fall and the first thing they do is send down billions and billions of dollars in extra spending. " // However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented a setback for the Administration and for Bob Dole of Kansas , the new Senate majority leader . Senator Grassley said he had " pleaded with Dole , " urging the leader to allow Republicans to offer their own alternatives " so we could be out in front " . // But Mr. Dole , who is up for re-election next year from a farm state , rejected the plea . Mr. Grassley said , " He felt we had done enough. " // At the end of the day ' s proceedings , Mr. Dole took the floor and in a weary voice said , " We haven ' t demonstrated in the Senate that we ' re prepared to face up to the deficit - at least today , we haven ' t. " // Estimates of the costs of the credit move varied considerably. // The first amendment passed by the Senate would provide $100 million to subsidize interest rates paid by farmers to commercial banks on loans guaranteed by the Federal Government . In addition , it would liberalize rules in two existing loan programs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By a vote of 54 to 45 , the Senate attached this amendment to a bill providing $175 million in aid for starving African countries . Of the eight Republicans who supported the amendment only one , Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut , does not represent a farm state . Only one Democrat , William Proxmire of Wisconsin , opposed it . <> <> Early Crop Payments // The second amendment adopted by the Senate would allow farmers to receive payments now for crops that will be harvested next fall . Normally the payments are made at harvest time , but farm state lawmakers say the advance payments would be an additional way of aiding hard-pressed farmers over the next few weeks. // The vote on this measure was 50 to 48 , with 5 Republicans joining 45 Democrats to approve the bill. // In the House , a sweeping bill was approved that includes the advance payment feature adopted by the Senate . In addition , it makes many of the procedural changes that farm state lawmakers say are needed to make the loans programs more workable. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was adopted by 318 to 103 . Few Republicans spoke against it on the floor , and 84 Republicans supported it on final passage . <> <> Credit Linked to Famine Bill // After approving the credit amendments , the Senate voted 62 to 35 to approve the bill on famine relief and send it to conference with the House , which adopted a similar famine bill on Tuesday . It was unclear tonight , however , whether lawmakers who are concerned mainly with agricultural matters would be able to participate in the conference , and whether the farm amendments would survive. // Representative Coleman , the Missouri Republican , said the program would have to be in place within two weeks . " Any later , " he said , " and credit will be a moot point for thousands of farmers who will be out of business. " // Mr. Coleman also predicted that the White House might " take another look " at its veto threat after seeing the " sizable vote " cast by Republicans today in favor of the measures. // Estimates of the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $8. 7 billion in 1985 to an assertion by Mr. O ' Neill that its cost would come to only $455 million over the next five years . <> <> Estimates on the Cost // The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the programs ' total charges against the budget for the current fiscal year would be closer to $3. 7 billion. // But Agriculture Secretary John R. Block said Tuesday , " Nobody can know for sure how much it will all come to until the money has already been spent. " // If the legislation is signed by the President , Mr. Block said , its cost would depend on how many farmers sought advanced commodity support loans this spring , how many defaults there were on federally guaranteed commercial farm loans , and how many country banks agreed to reduce interest rates on farm loans in return for matching cuts by the government. // Earlier in the day Senator Dole said the measures were " never going to become law . " And Senator Edward Zorinsky , a Nebraska Democrat , said it was doubtful that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconsider his position . <> <> Initial Administration Move // The Reagan Administration initially proposed a program of $650 million in guaranteed loans in the election campaign , as the farm credit crisis threatened to swamp Republicans in key agricultural states. // When Congress reconvened , lawmakers argued that the program was too small , and too rigid , to be of much help to farmers who were victimized by a combination of falling land prices , slumping export markets and high interest rates. // Senate Democrats , aided by some Republicans , organized a filibuster against the nomination of Edwin Meese 3d as Attorney General last week , and demanded action on an expanded credit program . The Administration agreed to lift the $650 million cap and said it would make " adequate " funds available to any qualified loan applicants . It also eased some of the regulations that were making the program difficult to use. // At that point Mr. Dole argued that Congress had solved the credit problem and should not do anything else . But Senate Democrats would not release the Meese nomination until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they proposed today. // Even though the White House had agreed to an unspecified increase in available loan funds , the House bill would explicitly raise the level to $3 billion , and the Senate version would increase it to $2. 45 billion. // Republican leaders argue that the credit measures set a bad precedent on the first major issue of the year , and will undermine attempts by Congress to agree on the " main event , " in Mr. Dole ' s phrase , a budget-reduction package. // //
