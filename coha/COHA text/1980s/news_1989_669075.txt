It ' s the stuff of which Hollywood movies are made . A young girl , devoted to her family and teammates , rises to the top of her sport through hard work and attitude adjustment . Set the story in a suburb called Downers Grove , name the main character Nicole Molzahn and make the rising action the Olympic Trials . But hold the climax . " I ' ve only just started to get good , " Molzahn warned . " It ' s not like I ' ve had a few good swims and now I ' m done . I ' ve hardly begun . " Call James Brooks . Resurrect Frank Capra . Get a pen ready , because Molzahn has promised that this weekend ' s state meet will be her " big finale for high school . " Keep in mind this comes from a girl who holds Downers Grove South school records in the breaststroke at 1 minute 6. 1 seconds and the individual medley at 2 : 09 flat ; she won both events in last Saturday ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been coaching 15 years , and she ' s probably the best I ' ve had , " said Downers Grove South swim coach Jenny Davis . " She has the unique ability to reach inside herself and motivate and encourage others . She ' s not one of those elite athletes who concentrates on their own interests . " It was Molzahn who interrupted Davis ' presectional meet pep talk to point out that the meet was not an individual but a team effort . " She said that the meet was for everyone to do their best times of the season , not just for a few people to try and make state , " Davis recalled . " That ' s got to be her neatest quality : her interest in other people . " It has made her a cocaptain with Liz Fields for the second year in a row . " I wasn ' t as into being captain last year , " Molzahn admitted . That may have been because she was following in the footsteps of her older sister , Michele , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during Molzahn ' s first two years of high school , she wasn ' t so sure swimming was what she wanted to concentrate on . She had placed 11th at the state track meet her sophomore year in the 800 meters , running 2 : 19 . Who was to say she couldn ' t be a success in running ? " I mean , my sophomore year in swimming , I didn ' t even qualify for sectionals , " Molzahn said . " I took a couple weeks off , and the whole time I was wondering , Am I really a bad swimmer or did I just have a bad season ? ' " The question gnawed at her . Nicole had started swimming at age 6 because Michele swam . Her parents , Roger and Gail , had never really pushed her . What was she doing in the sport , anyway ? Molzahn took exactly two weeks off before showing up at the Westmont Swim Club , where she trains in the open season . She was determined to find out once and for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the junior nationals in the 100 breast , " Molzahn said . " When I got there , I just swam out of my mind . It was like , bang ! All of a sudden , I was really good . " She placed second in 1 : 05. 1 . " And then I knew I was good , " she said . Junior nationals ended just as outdoor track began . But missing the indoor season proved critical . Molzahn limped through the spring with shin splints , tendinitis and swollen ankles . " That decided it , " she said . " I saw how well I did in swimming , and I knew I could do way better . " Molzahn ' s junior nationals time had qualified her for the Olympic Trials in Austin , Tex . It was her first senior-level meet , and suddenly the girl from Downers Grove found herself rubbing shoulders with the likes of Janet Evans and Matt Biondi . She placed smack dab in the middle : 42 out of 84 . In 1989 , Molzahn went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 breaststroke . It was during this time that her parents became the base of her support . " I spend a lot of time with my family , " Molzahn said . " They don ' t push me into things I don ' t want to do . Sometimes that ' s hard , because you want things spelled out for you . " Like college . Molzahn , a 4. 0 student , has narrowed it to Yale , Harvard , Princeton , Stanford , UCLA and Michigan . " I ' ve got eight essays to do , " she moaned . " They ' re such a pain . " Molzahn would much rather look forward to this weekend ' s state meet , where top swimmers like Deerfield ' s Becky Bruch and Waubonsie Valley ' s Giovana Chiesa wait . " I feel so much more ahead than I have been in the past , " Molzahn said . " It ' s coming down to the wire , and I can feel it . It ' s probably because it ' s my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how good I can be . " Get that pen handy . Nicole Molzahn intends to provide a happy ending.
