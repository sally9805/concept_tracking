PARIS  --  European stock market officials have at least one thing in common these days : immense insecurity . " Emotionally I am very insecure because I don ' t know where these markets are going , " Gerrit de Marez Oyens , general secretary of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange , said . Ettore Fumagalli , president of the Milan Stock Exchange , said the Oct. 19 market crash made him " reasonably pessimistic " about the prospects of a rebound in world equity markets . " It ' s going to take time " to restore public confidence in markets , he said , and he doesn ' t expect another bull market before the 1990s . As they met here last week for the first time since Black Monday , senior officials from nine European stock exchanges representing about 20% of the world equity market painted a dark picture . At the top of their agenda is the task of restoring public confidence in the markets , particularly among small investors . Meanwhile , trading volume has declined significantly , threatening profits and , consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with the bigger exchanges in New York , Tokyo and London . Officials at the meeting declined to comment on the report of the Brady commission on the U.S. market crash , saying they hadn ' t seen it yet , and they weren ' t available for comment over the weekend . But even before the report was released Friday , officials said they expect to see an increase in market regulation world-wide . They urged U.S. regulators to keep in mind that the securities market is a global one and that the crash underscored the need for more international cooperation on regulation . New York and Tokyo stock exchange officials , meanwhile , met with the European officials over the weekend in an executive committee session of the International Federation of Stock Exchanges . Participants said the session would include an informal post-mortem on the October crash . Market regulation is more a way of life in Tokyo than in the U.S. and much of Europe . The Tokyo Stock Exchange , for example , limits the amount that share prices can rise or fall in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange halts trading in it for the day . The Nikkei 225-stock index plunged 14. 9% last Oct. 20 , compared with the New York market ' s 22. 6% plunge the day before , on Black Monday , and market regulations wouldn ' t have allowed it to fall much further . That one-day drop was about 95% of the theoretical maximum the Tokyo market could fall . Many Tokyo shares didn ' t trade that day , because the price drop in New York was greater than the daily-decline limit in Tokyo and there weren ' t any buy orders . Japanese authorities , however , are trying to bring their market practices more in line with those of other major markets . Among the regulatory changes that the European officials expect to see are higher capital requirements for securities firms . But the officials at the Paris meeting warned against restrictions on such financial instruments as index options and portfolio insurance , saying those steps would only drive business to less regulated markets . " Inevitably , program trading is here to stay , " Christen Sorensen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one market limits such instruments , other markets will fill the gap , he said . The crash also has slowed the European markets ' efforts to modernize and restructure . " Everything is on hold , " Mariano Bengoechea , chief executive of the Madrid Stock Exchange said . Philippe Cosserat , general secretary of the French Stockbrokers Association , said , " European stock exchanges have gone through a crisis , and it isn ' t over yet . " One of the biggest problems has been the fall in trading . Since the crash , the value of stocks traded daily has fallen 30% in France , 38% in West Germany and 56% in Amsterdam , according to a recent survey by London stockbrokers James Capel &; Co . But " costs haven ' t changed , " Mr. Bengoechea of the Madrid exchange said . " Productivity has to grow for us just to stay even , " he said . In the short term , the crash will make it more difficult to pay for expensive computerized trading systems , price-reporting services and other technological changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the pace of modernization that is desirable , " Mr. Sorensen said . " It ' s more difficult to get reform if stockbrokers aren ' t making any money . " The bleak outlook was echoed by some trading-system vendors who were here during the meeting of exchange officials . " The crash has made people much more careful about spending money , " John Sanderson , a financial systems consultant at Raytheon Co. ' s Data Logic unit , said . He said there were few inquiries about new products or systems from the officials.  --  - World Market Activity In trading Friday , Tokyo shares gave up some early gains but still closed above Thursday ' s levels .
