" When you read the letters of Mozart and Beethoven , it makes you realize that they were people , that they were alive and writing for a purpose - for success , for money , to get audiences to love them , whatever . And when you see them not as icons but as real human beings , you begin to think , ' Well , after all , there are composers living today , and am I not being incredibly narrow-minded by having no contact with their work ? ' It ' s wrong not to . It was wrong 200 years ago , 100 years ago , and it ' s wrong now. // " Certainly for me , it ' s a way of life now to look forward to learning a new piece by someone . " In that case , the 38-year-old pianist has plenty to look forward to . This summer , he will give the premiere of Joseph Schwantner ' s new Piano Concerto with Leonard Slatkin and the St. Louis Symphony at the International Festival of the Performing Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a new work by Ezra Laderman with the American Composers Orchestra under a veteran new-music champion , Dennis Russell Davies . Mr. Davies also conducted Mr. Ax and the Philadelphia Orchestra at Saratoga last summer in William Bolcom ' s Piano Concerto . Other concertos new to the pianist ' s repertory include Sir Michael Tippett ' s work from 1954 , Hans Werner Henze ' s " Tristan " and Schoenberg ' s turgid , unforgiving concerto. // " I ' m trying to make it a policy for myself to learn a new 20th-century concerto every year , " says Mr. Ax , " even though most of what I play is Beethoven , Brahms , Mozart , Liszt . And of course I still do want to learn older repertory as well. " // When he will find the time is another question . Having barely come up for air since winning the first International Arthur Rubinstein Competition 14 years ago , Mr. Ax now averages 85 solo , chamber and orchestral performances a year in the United States and abroad . A recent two-week period found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis ( with whom he also made his first New York Philharmonic appearance , in l977 ) ; heading west to play the Brahms B-flat Concerto with the Cincinnati Symphony under Neeme Jarvi ; flying to Toronto for the Beethoven Second with Yoel Levi ; and doubling back to Los Angeles for Tippett ' s concerto under Andre Previn . Thereafter followed a week of solo recitals on the West Coast , more concertos , and finally rehearsals with his longtime partner , the cellist Yo-Yo Ma , in preparation for their current tour , which ends this afternoon with a joint recital this afternoon at 3 o ' clock at Avery Fisher Hall in a program featuring works by Beethoven , Chopin and Brahms. // Though the self-effacing Mr. Ax would be the last to say so , his career is flourishing . Yet there is something more in the wings . " This is a very crucial time for me , " he says with characteristic levelheadedness . " In the next five years I have to practice very hard and learn a lot about piano playing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s funny how that changes , " he continues . " I used to think when I was 21 or 22 that once I reached my late 30 ' s I ' d be an old , mature guy . Now I ' m in my late 30 ' s and I feel as if I were 21 . I think if I work very hard I have it in me to develop into someone who has something really important to say . " That may sound like false modesty , but Mr. Ax seems to mean it . " I guess what we all really want to do is get better , " he adds . " If you don ' t try to improve all the time , the profession becomes unrewarding . " The Russian-born Mr. Ax began his studies with his father , a speech and voice therapist who coached at the Lwow Opera . The family moved to Canada in the late 50 ' s and arrived in New York when the pianist was 12 . He attended Juilliard ' s preparatory division on a scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , and returned to the conservatory for his master ' s degree . He studied at Juilliard only with Mieczyslaw Munz . ( " For me , no other teacher was necessary . " ) One of his first paying jobs was accompanying students of the late cellist Leonard Rose for $2. 50 an hour. // Among the European competitions , Mr. Ax holds blue ribbons from the Vianna da Motta in Lisbon , the Chopin in Warsaw and the Queen Elisabeth in Brussels . Aside from the Avery Fisher Prize , which he received in 1979 , the Rubinstein was probably the most significant award , both for its international visibility and for the opportunity it afforded the young pianist to work with Rubinstein himself. // " He was very inspiring , " says Mr. Ax , " and tremendously helpful . We must have worked two or three hours on each of the pieces I brought to him the Chopin F-minor Concerto and Ravel ' s " Valses nobles et sentimentales " . He ' d stop me every second note and tell me what he did there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with RCA Red Seal , for which Mr. Ax has made more than 20 recordings of the standard repertory. // Frustrated by what he felt was RCA ' s failure to market his records properly ( RCA wasn ' t happy with sales , either ) and by the contractual hassles whenever he wanted to record with Mr. Ma ( who records for CBS Masterworks ) , the pianist recently severed his longterm relationship with RCA to sign with CBS . In the next six months , that label plans to release a solo Chopin recording and three chamber collections on which Mr. Ax variously performs with Mr. Ma and the violinists Isaac Stern , Jaime Laredo and Young Uck Kim . Also in the works are the two Liszt concertos and the Brahms Second , not to mention the complete Haydn sonatas. // The pianist appears willing to accept the realities of the marketplace with respect to his new passion for contemporary music , but is determined to keep on with it . " You see , what ' s so exciting in playing pieces like the Tippett concerto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in bringing it to people for the first time . In a way , I ' m a middleman , a conduit . I ' m here to bring great music written by other people to the general listening public. " // Critics have said of Mr. Ax that his ego never gets in the way of his music-making . He seems to treat all music with tremendous respect and claims he has to practice much longer and harder than most pianists . " I ' m incredibly prone to self doubt , " he says . " The only way I can overcome it is by making more of an effort . " And it shows . A consummate technician , Mr. Ax is a colorist of unusual dimension ; his thoughtful , economical phrasing leaves not a note unaccounted for. // Next fall , Messrs . Ax and Ma will make a return trip to the Far East with Isaac Stern . " He treats us very well , " says Mr. Ax of the violinist . " He ' s incredibly careful never to give a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his repertory , both old and new , Mr. Ax makes no secret of his love for Brahms . " I want to learn all of Brahms , " he says , as if confessing a sin of great magnitude . " I just love that music . I wallow in it . I feel good playing Brahms , not only emotionally and intellectually , but also physically . There ' s a kind of grasp of the keyboard - it ' s a very specific kind of piano writing that has to do with moving your hand and arm maybe more than moving your fingers. // " A large part of being able to play an instrument is being able to let go physically , because it leads to greater openness . When I play Brahms I feel that I can give all of me . There ' s something truly liberating about his music. " // The months ahead are filled with plans for learning new works and making new tours and records and especially finding more time for his wife and two children . " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first flight out after a concert , " says Mr. Ax . " I just want to get home and see my family . " Isn ' t the pace a bit overwhelming ? " I ' m one of the few people I know who are actually doing what they always dreamed of doing . What more can you ask for ? " <> <> MA ON AX // Emanuel Ax and Yo-Yo Ma have long been musical colleagues and personal friends , and Mr. Ma talks of his friend with obvious respect and admiration. // " Manny is a person of tremendous musical integrity , " he says . " He has such a breadth of knowledge and is such an enthusiast . When he looks at a score he really looks at all the details. // " I tell him he has an elephant memory . He never forgets anything - symphonies , operas , you name it . We ' ll be playing through something , and he ' ll often say , ' Oh , this reminds me of this piece or that piece. ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 concerts together this season , some as a trio with the violinists Isaac Stern or Young Uck Kim , most as a duo . Their recordings of the Brahms and Beethoven cello sonatas , on RCA and CBS , respectively , have both won Grammy awards. // The two men are uncannily sensitive and attuned to one another , both on and off stage. // " When you work together closely and you travel and see one another practically 18 hours a day , " says Mr. Ma , " you really get to know somebody - their foibles , vulnerabilities - and you become very honest with one another. // " Like a real relationship . You develop a common vocabulary with which to talk about music , and in some ways you can get to the core quicker. " //
