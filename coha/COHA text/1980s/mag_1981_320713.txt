For the past generation , Washington policymakers have based their economic projections on econometric models . Pioneered by Nobel Prizewinner Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania , the models are a series of equations that use past economic behavior as a guide to future business trends . Economists , for example , are able to predict the effects of a tax cut on new car sales . <P> Some of the Reaganauts , however , came into office wanting to do things differently . Instead of forecasts that use past behavior as the main standard , they based the economic outlook on how business would perform if everything worked out according to their theories . They put those assumptions into their computers , and the results were indeed impressive . Growth next year was to be 7% , and inflation would decline to 6.5% before falling to under 5% in 1985 . By contrast , the Carter Administration had predicted 3.5% growth and 9.6% inflation for next year . <P> The Reagan Dream Machine was the work of Lawrence Kudlow , 33 , former chief economist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. , and John Rutledge , 32 , head of the Claremont Economics Institute in Southern California . <P> Kudlow , who will soon be named chief economist of the Office of Management and Budget , insists that traditional econometric models are useless now because they do not measure the explosion of work and savings that will occur when President Reagan cuts taxes . Said Kudlow : " We have a new set of ideas , and a traditional model would merely serve to mislead and confuse the American people . " <P> Other professional economists , however , claimed that it was Kudlow and Rutledge who were misleading people . M.I.T. 's Lester Thurow derided their whole approach on the ground that the two economists were asking people to accept their predictions without revealing how they had been calculated . Said he : " These numbers are being thrown out of a black box . Normally , whether it is a conservative or a liberal Administration , somebody has a chance to complain about the evidence , meet the people face to face , and argue about whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out projections without ever discussing their methodology . " Charles Schultze , formerly Jimmy Carter 's chief economist , called the Kudlow-Rutledge predictions " quite radical " and " wishful thinking . " <P> Such grumbling finally had an impact . <P> Conventional economists within the Administration , led by Murray Weidenbaum , chairman-designate of the Council of Economic Advisers , reportedly argued that the Administration had to return to a more traditional econometric forecast or run the risk that its whole program might lose credibility . Last week Kudlow and Rutledge revised their figures and came up with more realistic projections . They now predict that growth next year will be 4% , while inflation will drop only to 8% . That is still too optimistic for many in Washington . Capital wags are now quipping that the highest-ranking woman in the new Administration is named Rosy Scenario .
