In 1973 , on this date in American history , the marketing experts , doltish pharisees and razzle-dazzle tamperers of the American League promulgated the designated hitter rule : " A hitter may be designated for the starting pitcher and all subsequent pitchers in any game without otherwise affecting the status of the pitcher(s) in the game . A DH for the pitcher must be selected prior to the game and must be included in the lineup cards presented to the umpire-in-chief . " The bureaucratic innovators solemnly added nine paragraphs of portentous trivia to meet implausible contingencies : " Once the game pitcher bats for the DH this move shall terminate the DH role for the remainder of the game . " The DH was supposed to be a three-year " experiment , " as temporary as a three-year excise tax . The decade ' s anniversary is worth noting in the midst of the National Football League ' s y ' all-come , **27;72;TOOLONG " playoffs . " The major difference between pro football and baseball is that one has investors and the other has fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Orioles playing to form against the White Sox . In football , however , thousands of fingernails are chewed by fans far distant who fear that Tampa Bay might " upset " the Dallas Cowboys not by beating them , but by threatening the point spread . The soul of pro football belongs to the bookies , in possible joint custody with Howard Cosell . It has no purity to lose . Each ludicrous layer of rules changes , franchise expansion and playoff proliferation provides more " action " for the bookies if not more beguiling action on the field . Every office staff , every factory shift contains some smiling Monday morning quarterback who beats the bookies . He does so by diligent perusal of NFL rosters . A Cincinnati cornerback ' s troublesome ankle is calibrated into the investment portfolio . Industrious followers of the NFL earn every nickel and could better employ their talents on Wall Street . They ' re not fans ; they ' re brokerage houses . The soul of baseball still belongs to the fans who enjoy its languid purity . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher batting forhimself . A non-DH world of baseball offers wondrous moments of proper tension and anxiety . Was Bob Lemon that good a hitter when he pitched for Cleveland ? As Casey Stengel said , you could look it up . In 1947 , Lemon hit .321 ; in 1949 , he had seven home runs in 37 games . Monstrous Dick Radatz had a lifetime average of .131 . Although Jim Palmer only hit .150 during Baltimore ' s world championship season of 1970 , he doesn ' t like the DH rule because " I feel I can help myself hitting , especially bunting and hitting behind the runner . " New York Mets fans are not likely to forget the game in Montreal in 1970 when Tom Seaver hit his first career home run , returned joyously to the dugout to find his teammates in a splendid gag , sitting idle and bored as though nothing had happened . The American League at one time considered a " designated runner " rule , an expansionist grotesquerie that would do nothing for baseball but would whet the appetities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in baseball , but even on this mournful anniversary of the DH , arguing about it is a pleasure , almost as much as looking forward to its resumption .
