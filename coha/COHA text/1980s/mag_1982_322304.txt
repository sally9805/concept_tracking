The U.S. is already a loser as Britain besieges the Argentines <P> At last the end was in sight . From his secure position on Mount Kent , Major General John Jeremy Moore , commander of the British ground forces on the Falkland Islands , gazed through his binoculars at the blue-and-white Argentine flag fluttering over the capital , Port Stanley , twelve miles away . " We 'll hoist the Union Jack down there just as soon as we can get there , " he told his men confidently . " And believe me , it wo n't take long . " <P> Although freezing fog appeared to hamper the British at week 's end , time was indeed running out-and not just for the besieged Argentine soldiers . Britain 's rapid drive toward the island capital had touched off an eleventh-hour flurry of diplomatic activity that sought to prevent a final bloody battle , which could make a bad situation worse . A head-on clash at Port Stanley could not only lead to appalling casualties on both sides but further inflame Latin American bitterness against both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain influence in a strategically important corner of the South Atlantic by offering aid to a beleaguered Argentina . <P> Washington policymakers feared that by inflicting a humiliating military defeat on its foe , Britain might wreck any chance of a broad , long-term settlement that would have to involve Argentina . Such a defeat , the U.S. believes , could also precipitate the downfall of Argentina 's ruling junta , leading to political chaos and revolving-door governments that might be even more prone to renew attacks on the islands . In addition , protracted hostilities would put an enormous drain on Britain 's resources and on NATO , which would be deprived of British ships and troops . <P> Outlining the dangers that a continuing conflict posed for U.S. policy , Secretary of State Alexander Haig said that " in many respects , American interests were more heavily engaged in the Falklands than even the interests of the two parties . " Haig was referring to the fact that by backing Britain , the U.S. had endangered its overall relations with Argentina as well as with Latin America as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view that the U.S. had no choice but to side with an ally-and against a country trying to gain disputed territory by force . <P> The issue brought about an angry confrontation between the Secretary of State and Jeane Kirkpatrick , the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. , who had argued that the U.S. should avoid taking sides in order to protect its relations with Latin America ( see box ) . <P> Seeking to avoid a potentially disastrous clash at Port Stanley , the U.S. was urging the Argentines to withdraw before the British drove them off the islands . Privately , American officials warned Buenos Aires that the U.S. could do nothing to prevent a British assault and that Argentina 's bargaining position would be far weaker after a crushing military defeat .
