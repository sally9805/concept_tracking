Fallout from a record default spreads from Washington State to Wall Street <P> D-day finally arrived last week for the Washington Public Power Supply System . D for default . D for debacle . With its coffers almost empty , WPPSS or Whoops , as everyone now calls the agency , formally declared that it could not repay $2.25 billion in bonds used to finance partial construction of two now abandoned nuclear power plants in Washington State . It is by far the largest municipal bond default in U.S. history , and the damage is incalculable . The fiasco has robbed thousands of investors of their savings , shaken confidence in the municipal bond market , angered and humiliated the people of the Northwest , tarnished the reputations of some of Wall Street 's leading institutions and provoked at least 70 lawsuits that will be clogging the courts for years to come . <P> Over the past decade , Whoops borrowed $8.3 billion to start construction on a total of five nuclear plants , only one of which is likely to be completed . The bonds in default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5 . Some $6 billion worth of other Whoops bonds for Projects 1 , 2 and 3 are in no immediate danger of default , but investors are increasingly afraid that these securities will also eventually be in jeopardy . Projects 1,2 and 4 are located at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in eastern Washington , while 3 and 5 are at Satsop , in the western part of the state . <P> The default had been expected for weeks , so the municipal bond market reacted quietly , with most prices holding fairly steady . But concern about Whoops ' woes had been depressing the market for months . Public utilities building power plants have had to promise exceptionally high tax-exempt interest rates of more than 9% to sell new bonds . Several utilities , like North Carolina Municipal Power Agency No. 1 , postponed their offerings to avoid testing the market . Some industry insiders fear that the continuing Whoops mess could ultimately sour investors on the entire spectrum of municipal bonds .
