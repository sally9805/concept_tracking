The United States and Britain , George Bernard Shaw once remarked , are two nations separated by a common language . Today he might say much the same thing about the U.S. and the whole world . ICE CUBOS , says a sign in the Mexican resort of Acapulco . Lebanese audiences watching Rambo shout exhortations in English , and a Japanese rock-'n ' - roll hit begins , " Let 's dancin ' people Hoshi-kuzu nagarete feel so good . . . " <P> It was the British empire , on which the sun never set , that originally spread English around the world , along with tea breaks , cuffed trousers and the stiff upper lip . But when the imperial sun finally did set after World War II , the American language followed American power into the vacuum . Key reason : the language has a rare forcefulness and flexibility . Even the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary last month incorporated such Americanisms as yuppie and zilch . Explained Editor Robert Burchfield : " Our language is changing slowly , and America is leading the way now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . The ads in Italy 's Corriere della Sera for just one day included the words personnel , administrator , quality audit , contract manager and know-how . Germans routinely refer to their employer as der Boss , who is expected to be a good Manager . " American English is definitely the model , not English  --  this is what we see looking through French advertising , " says Micheline Faure , organizing secretary of a Paris group called AGULF , which was formed to resist the linguistic invasion . Japanese ads , posters and shopping bags are full of a special kind of American English , often starting with an enthusiastic " Let 's , " as in " Let 's hiking " or " Let 's sex . " <P> Hand in hand with commerce goes technology , and the tools of technology were mostly baptized in the U.S. The French still cling to ordinateur instead of computer , but in Italy even schoolchildren call it by its American name . Also floppy disks , lasers , compact disks , software . Germans buy Tapes , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitec . <P> And the athletic life . A French magazine called Vital ( pronounced Veet-al ) is full of terms such as le rafting and le trekking . The Germans go in for das Joggen , while Italians turn to il body building . <P> And show biz . Words such as network , rock , video , new wave , hit parade , album all turn up in Swedish or , for that matter , Arabic . Show biz helps introduce the language of romance : sexy , playboy and , eventually , baby sitter . In Japan , the English names for sexual organs are considered more polite than the Japanese terms , and pink is now the Japanese word for all erotic entertainment . <P> This combination of money and technology , show biz and sex appeal strikes many foreigners as the epitome of the American success story , and so they adopt English words that imply success itself : super , blue chip , boom , status symbol , summit . Some of that , clearly , is just snobbery . Through U.S. television , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Americanized vocabulary " if you want to show you 're with it and talking like Americans , the most fashionable people on earth . " On the other hand , some upper-class Egyptian youths think it is chic to use Anglo-Saxon four-letter words like  --  well , merde .
