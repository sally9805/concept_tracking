Instead of venturing onto one of the summer islands off the western coast of Scotland , they blundered onto a rocky outcrop that had been used for biological warfare experiments during the 1940s . Decades later it was still contaminated with anthrax spores . First the animal , then the couple , contracted the illness and died horrifying deaths at sea. // Mr. Mosey , who has long since forgotten the book ' s title , took more than passing interest . For from the front door of his house in this seaside hamlet , the grizzled Scotsman could see just such an island some three miles across Gruinard Bay. // // Gruinard Island , off the coast northwest of Inverness , was used by the British Ministry of Defense more than 40 years ago to test the potential of anthrax as a biological warfare agent. // The experiment was successful - if that is the proper word - beyond the scientists ' wildest expectations . Gruinard Island was inadvertently contaminated for more than four decades . Only this year has it been declared suitable for human use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1941 , scientists at Britain ' s chemical warfare center at Porton Down , England , were afraid that Germany and Japan had perfected biological weapons . They embarked on a secret crash program to create their own bio-weapons , and selected Gruinard Island as the test site. // After tethering sheep to stakes , the researchers exploded canisters containing billions of anthrax spores . They took notes on how quickly the animals began to die , and at what distance from the center of the bombing. // An ancient disease as a weapon // ANTHRAX is a disease caused by a bacterium known as Bacillus anthracis . Known since antiquity , it is endemic to many regions of the world , and sometimes affects human beings in contact with livestock and animal products . In Britain , it is known as ' ' wool-sorter ' s disease ' ' ; in the Soviet Union , ' ' Siberian fever. ' ' // What makes anthrax effective as a biological weapon is the many ways in which it spreads . It can cause infection if ingested or inhaled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bacterium has the ability to form a spore - in effect , creating a tough coating about itself that can resist sunlight , heat , and disinfectants . These spores , which can be harvested easily from man-made fermentation vats , are easily dispersed through the air. // Mortality rates are usually high for untreated victims . Partly as a result of the Gruinard Island tests , the United States chose anthrax as one of the agents in its own biological warfare arsenal . ( The US biological weapons program was halted in 1969 , and the arsenal was destroyed ; only biological defense research is permitted today. ) // The British government found early on that anthrax could get out of control . Although the researchers destroyed the sheep carcasses with explosives , and assumed that any wind-borne spores would fall harmlessly into the ocean , there was an outbreak of anthrax on the Scottish mainland in 1943 , the year the tests on Gruinard were terminated . It is still unclear whether spores drifted over from the island , or whether a contaminated carcass washed ashore. // Spores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict wartime secrecy prevented word of the outbreak from spreading . Scientists hurriedly returned to the island to burn off the heather and , with it , the anthrax . They found , however , that anthrax spores had migrated under the soil , forming a deadly underground lacework of infectious organisms. // That year , the British government declared Gruinard Island off limits to man or beast . For the next four decades , signs along the coastal edge warned any landing parties away. // Periodically , scientists in protective suits would venture // onto the island to confirm that it was still contaminated . Each year , the government updated the warning on the markers to reflect the current year. // One of the men who changed the signs was John Gunn , now in his 80s . He was one of few who regularly visited the island over the years , an experience he speaks about reluctantly. // The island visitor speaks // ' I DIDN ' T much care what they were doing on the island , ' ' he says . ' ' It didn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Not a single person. ' ' // One woman from the village , however - who asked not to be named - disagreed : ' ' Certainly people worried about it . And they were right to worry. ' ' // She , for example , wondered what would happen if sea gulls had carried contaminated soil from the island to the mainland. // ' ' If there was birds flying from the island over here , they never did no harm , ' ' says Mr. Gunn. // He says that rabbits thrived on the island over the years . But he allows that he never worried , because ' ' The rabbits , they couldn ' t swim. ' ' // Over the years , the British government abandoned both chemical and biological weapons , and today it prohibits anything other than defensive research. // The once-isolated north of Scotland became a tourist mecca , and Gruinard became a greater embarrassment for successive British governments. // In the late 1970s , scientists determined that only three or four of Gruinard ' s 550 acres were contaminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of formaldehyde and sea water would kill the remaining spores. // The nongovernmental Royal Conservation Society , at the invitation of the British Defense Ministry , appointed a watchdog committee to oversee the decontamination effort and ensure that the island was rendered safe . In 1986 , a contractor laid a grid of 30 miles of drip hoses to douse the contaminated areas . Afterward , soil samples were taken , in some places down to bedrock. // The result , says Graham Pearson , the current head of the official British Chemical Defense Establishment , at Porton Down , was that ' ' the treatment was by and large effective. ' ' // Life returns to island // TO prove the point , local sheep farmer Angus Renwick was invited to graze some of his herd on Gruinard Island from May to October of 1987 . The animals were monitored by veterinarians ; none contracted anthrax. // ' ' They flourished being over there , ' ' says Mr. Renwick ' s wife , Nancy. // Mr. Renwick will not talk to reporters about his experiences on the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant place . ' ' There was rabbits over there , and a duck with her young family. ' ' // In May of this year , the British Defense Ministry declared Gruinard safe for normal use , and offered the island back to the original owners , a family trust , for the 1941 purchase price of ( STR ) 500 ( $915 at today ' s exchange ) . // Today , the island is remarkable mainly for its rugged beauty . The last two patches of land to be decontaminated are greener than the rest of the island . But that is likely to change as the native flora reclaims the land . Then there are likely to be few visual reminders that this island was an early victim of the effort to wage war by biological means. // But it could take longer for the cloud of secrecy and controversy that enveloped Gruinard to dissipate . Even now , many of the locals refer to it only as ' ' Anthrax ' ' Island. // ' ' They say it ' s safe now , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t know. . . . ' ' // //
