For Drexel Burnham Lambert and its junk-bond wizard , Michael Milken , the pretense is over and the divorce begins . In court papers filed last week , it was disclosed that Drexel has agreed to fire Milken and withhold his 1988 bonus , estimated at $200 million . Since the investment firm has already agreed to settle criminal-fraud charges against it for a $650 million penalty , denying Milken his money effectively reduces the fine by more than 30% . Milken 's attorney , Martin Flumenbaum , castigated the settlement as a " violation of due process , a punishment without trial . " Separate criminal charges against Milken for securities fraud are expected to be filed soon .
