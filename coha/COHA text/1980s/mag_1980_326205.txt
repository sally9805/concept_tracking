GLORIA <P> Directed and Written by John Cassavetes <P> What Method actor would not love to work with John Cassavetes ? His films ( Shadows , Faces , A Woman Under the Influence ) are actors ' showcases . His camera waits patiently for the smallest behavioral tic or the grandest explosion of dynamite acting . The characters he creates are compulsive talkers , walkers , smokers , prowling the urban nightscape , their lives a cacophonic symphony of desperation , their aggressions spilling out like a Bowery bum 's shirttail . Cassavetes encourages openness , improvisation , the primacy of being over performing . An actor prepares , and the moviegoer watches , and Cassavetes approves . He as much as tells his cast : The screen is yours , the script is yours ; run with it . For actors trained by such evangelical Methodists as Lee Strasberg , this is heaven , like being back at the Actors Studio , but going public and getting paid for it . <P> This approach does not always make for good movies . An actor 's revelation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravura scenes may torpedo the narrative structure . What is meant as a species of cinema verite may too easily become as specious as old-fashioned movie-star acting . Cassavetes is a deadly serious director , but his films are best seen as rickety star vehicles . His most shining star-his Bette Davis , his Gloria Swanson , his Joan Blondell-is his wife Gena Rowlands . In Gloria , he has finally realized her strengths and her limitations , and has cranked out a passable imitation of those ' 30s gangster movies with brassy broads and sassy tots , a Methodical Little Miss Marked Woman . <P> Gloria Swenson ( get it ? ) was once a chorine and a mobster 's moll . Now she 's on the lam from her old pals , with a neighbor 's Puerto Rican son in tow . For two hours of screen time , Gloria and tough little Phil ( and the movie ) meander around Manhattan because the Mob has covered all the bus , train and air terminals and the fugitives never think to rent a car . But nothing fazes Gloria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekily with hoods and , in defense of her ward and for the sheer hell of it , triggers half a dozen deaths . <P> Gloria is also a golddigger with a heart of gold and Gloria is the story of two hard people coming to terms with love and trust . The movie 's achievement is that it manages to be almost as effective as it is predictable . Its failure is in pretending to a naturalism it can not maintain whenever movie actress and movie crew go slumming through the Big Apple and bystanders gawk into the lens , auditioning for stardom in some future Cassavetes film . <P> At 46 , Rowlands is a terrific-looking woman who has aged like a fine piece of furniture : even the scratches and weather-warps are marks of character . Cassavetes ' camera has found a fit object of veneration , a great movie-star face that , in motion or repose , commands attention . In Gloria , Rowlands obviously has a lot of fun playing the hard-boiled momma . She hunches her shoulders , narrows her eyes , breathes through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out lines like " I do n't like kids . I hate kids . Especially your kids , " and " I 'll kill anybody that 's tryin ' ta kill me. "
