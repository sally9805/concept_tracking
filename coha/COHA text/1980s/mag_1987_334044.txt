For years it was viewed as an almost impossibly small dot on the financial horizon , a historic goal to be pursued in frustrating fits and starts . Suddenly , in 1986 , the target became closer and more tantalizing . As 1987 brought a fresh frenzy of trading on the New York Stock Exchange , everyone on Wall Street , as well as investors across the U.S. and around the world , was caught up in the drama : Just when would the Dow Jones industrial average gather its full force and break through the psychologically portentous barrier of 2000 ? <P> Last week , more than 14 years after the Dow leaped the 1000 mark , the big moment finally arrived . As Big Board floor traders cheered and filled the air with confetti , the closing bell rang last Thursday with the index solidly perched at 2002.25 . Then on Friday , after briefly falling from its record height , the Dow rallied to its sixth straight gain of the new year and finished the week at 2005.91 . <P> If shattering the 2000 mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most exhilarating achievement yet in one of the longest and strongest bull markets in U.S. history . Since the advance began in 1982 , stock prices have more than doubled , raining hundreds of millions of dollars of profits on investors . <P> On Wall Street , however , today 's victories always make way for tomorrow 's doubts . Will passing 2000 propel the Dow to still greater heights ? Or will the rise run out of momentum now that the magic goal has been reached ? ( Students of stock-market history recall all too well that after the Dow passed 1000 , it stalled for a decade before it cracked 1100 . ) And perhaps most important of all , why is the market so high when the economy continues to be so lackluster ? <P> Considering such questions mere quibbles , many optimistic analysts are convinced that the crashing of the 2000 barrier is the start of another major market upsurge that might last anywhere from two to five years . That would be a truly extraordinary event , since the current bull has already lasted for 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of postwar bull markets . Nonetheless , declares Steven Einhorn , chief portfolio strategist for the Goldman Sachs investment house , " there is a lot of life left in this bull market . " <P> Other sages of the investment community agree . One of Wall Street 's hottest gurus , Georgia-based Robert Prechter , has used an arcane branch of analysis known as Elliott Wave Theory to predict that the Dow is on a march that will peak at 3600 by 1988 . In December 1985 , Yale Hirsch , editor of the newsletter Smart Money , forecast the date of the Dow 's 2000 day within roughly a week . Now Hirsch predicts that the index may climb to 2300 within three months and reach 2700 later this year . <P> On the other hand , no less a figure than Liberal Economist John Kenneth Galbraith , writing in the January Atlantic Monthly , warns of parallels between the current breathtaking stock-market expansion and the pre-Crash era of 1929 . Maintains Galbraith : " The question now , in the winter of 1987 , is whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The wise , though for most the improbable course , is to assume the worst .
