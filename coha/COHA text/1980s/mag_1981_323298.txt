A " vanished " priest turns up <P> Back home in Chicago , he was known as a political activist who strongly opposed the U.S. involvement in El Salvador . Deciding to investigate the situation on his own , he became an interpreter for a Chicago television crew-he was fluent in Spanish-and arrived in San Salvador three weeks ago . Then , after attending Mass on Sunday , Father Roy Bourgeois , 42 , a Maryknoll priest , simply vanished . The initial assumption was that he had become yet another victim of the country 's endemic political terrorism . " I 'm as certain as I can be that he did n't disappear of his own free will , " said his superior , Father James Noonan , when he arrived to look into the case . <P> Noonan , like everyone else , was wrong . Bourgeois was traveling around the country , walking , riding in buses , sleeping on the ground , talking endlessly with the peasants he hoped to redeem . He had planned to spend two months in the countryside , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some companions found themselves facing a large army column in guerrilla-dominated Morazn province . A few days later , tired and dirty , Bourgeois walked into the U.S. embassy in San Salvador . <P> TIME has learned that the El Salvador government issued an order for Bourgeois 's arrest for " subversion " and that the U.S. embassy was able to hustle him out of the country only after getting the reluctant support of Jos Napolen Duarte , head of the ruling junta . Arriving in New York , Bourgeois said the object of his trip had been " to walk among the poor and to join their struggle for justice and peace . " If the military and the right-wing death squads need any excuse for further harassing church workers in El Salvador , Bourgeois may have given them a ready-made rationale . <P> At week 's end , the Salvadoran government confirmed reports that it had arrested six men , probably National Guardsmen , two weeks ago for the December murders of four women missionaries , including two Maryknoll nuns . The soldiers were not identified , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The arrests were said to have followed a telephone call from Secretary of State Alexander Haig to President Duarte demanding action . Six National Guard rifles were sent last week from El Salvador to FBI headquarters in Washington for ballistics tests . The bullets will be compared with a number taken from the scene of the murders .
