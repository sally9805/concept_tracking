Rating rock : Rolling Stone scores some bull's-eyes from the hip <P> " So I ca n't tell you the exact margin , " James Thurber wrote in one of his most celebrated diversions . " But . . . you could look it up . " Thurber was writing about baseball , specifically , about a game in which a sawed-off number named Pearl du Monville - all 35 inches of him - rallies a flagging team and pushes them on toward the pennant . There are many sources to check sports stats , but for the even woollier recreation of rock ' n ' roll , the research pickings have been slim . The Rolling Stone Record Guide ( Random House/Rolling Stone Press ; $19.95 hard cover , $8.95 in paper ) is a lively start to ward righting this situation . No more trips to the record store to consult the catalogues . The Guide contains enough spirited information to begin reckoning that exact margin . <P> Edited by Dave Marsh with John Swenson , the Guide is a survey of nearly 10,000 albums now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some way rock related . There are almost three dozen contributors , most of them card-carrying critics who pack strong opinions . The book is organized by artist . Styles are surveyed , ratings apportioned ( from " Worthless " to " Indispensable " ) , careers evaluated and , in a some cases , trashed . There may not be a great many surprises here . The good guys ( Springsteen , Dylan , the Who ) win ; the bad guys ( from Black Sabbath and the Tubes to Mac Davis and Kenny Rogers ) are pumped full of holes . The contributors may be quick to shoot from the hip , but they score a fair share of bull's-eyes . " Limpid ' adult bubblegum ' rockers " seems about right for Crosby , Stills and Nash , while Marsh gives fast , passionate rundowns on Elvis or a great band like Creedence Clearwater Revival . <P> Intended as a carry-all consumer consultancy , the Guide may find its greatest value by tempting readers into playing something that has not been in the Top 100 for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it is a collection by Solomon Burke or some blues by Jimmy Reed . The evaluations can be infuriatingly arbitrary : albums by a group of four-chord gobblers like Mahogany Rush are rated as high as some by Van Morrison and Neil Young . The fault , however , is also part of the point . Rock reviewing is high-temperature writing . It has as much in common with the sports page as the book review . The best entries in the Guide mean to pick a fight , to get you to listen close and to give a sense of rock history . There is even a glossary . Maybe you 're worried because the kids have started talking about doo-wops , and you think its something they 're buying off the homeroom pusher . You could look it up . And relax .
