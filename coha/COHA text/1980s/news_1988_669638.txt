She digs ' ' Take Five , ' ' ' ' I Got Rhythm , ' ' and ' ' Swingin ' Shepherd Blues . ' ' She sports black harem pants and bare shoulders above a metallic-gold top . And she takes to the stage with a spunkiness that says ' ' Let ' s jam ! ' ' to her bass and drum player. // // Wait a minute . Jazz - on a harp ? // That ' s what a competition judge said to her once : ' ' Dear , you really shouldn ' t try to play those tunes. ' ' // But Ms. Henson-Conant contends that the harp is an ' ' uncharted ' ' instrument with ' ' such variation of colors . ' ' She tells of the time John McLaughlin , a noted jazz guitarist , walked over to her harp as it was lying on its side . ' ' He began playing it like a guitar - and it was amazing . What he did was inspiring to me , ' ' she said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 800 in the United States ) , but of the few jazz harpists around , Henson-Conant is the only one who plays regularly in a jazz trio. // In an intimate nightclub or theater , the sheer physical stature and beauty of her 65-pound instrument transfixes the eye . With its painted smokestack column , gracefully curving brass neck , and red and green strings , it looks more like a museum piece - some ancient Greek treasure - than anything of practical value. // Henson-Conant admits the harp has a ' ' bad rap ' ' for being - well , gaudy . All the other orchestral instruments are so ' ' businesslike , ' ' she said , ' ' and look at the harp - it ' s gold , it ' s painted . No wonder people think it ' s kind of dumb. ' ' // So she was surprised at the positive response to her musical act . ' ' People have been very intrigued to hear what the harp can do. ' ' // Indeed , Henson-Conant has been called ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city ' s top jazz clubs and radio stations have welcomed her as one of their own for years . Today she embarks upon her first international tour , to Edinburgh and to Landshut , West Germany , where she ' ll be performing and giving workshops to classical and folk harpists. // Henson-Conant used to play harp with the San Jose and Oakland Symphonies back in her native state of California. // ' ' I would never be an orchestral harpist now - it ' s terrifying , ' ' she says , referring to the times she ' s had to count 450 measures to herself , hoping to come in on time . ' ' My greatest claim to fame as an orchestral harpist is that I can count ! ' ' // So jazz is now her beat , a logical choice , since she ' s loved to improvise all her life - even in classical pieces ( ' ' to make the mistakes make sense ' ' ) . // ' ' One reason that a lot of harpists don ' t go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - moving from one key to another key . ' ' To get the ' ' blue ' ' notes of jazz , Henson-Conant uses the harp ' s foot pedals to ' ' bend ' ' the pitches - a taboo in classical harp playing . ' ' I put more wear and tear on the ( pedal mechanism ) in a week than most harpists would in two months. ' ' // In concert , Henson-Conant looks like an athlete at times , striking sharp , crisp chords with the left hand and picking frenetic scales with the right . Shoulder muscles strain and flex , and the percussive tones complement the drummer ' s rim-taps on the snare . Other times , such as during her original ' ' Wizard of Oz ' ' medley , the lift and sweep of her arms could be a ballet move from ' ' Swan Lake. ' ' // Pop singer Livingston Taylor described Henson-Conant ' s skills as ' ' mind-boggling ' ' at her recent concert in Somerville , Mass . ' ' She has a fire within her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets . ' ' Here ' s a woman who ' s as powerful a jazz player as anyone who ' s out there. ' ' // Henson-Conant said she never intended to be a performer - or to play the harp . She spent time in college writing for musical theater , composing , and singing . As a child , she learned how to tune a harp . ' ' Then the college said , ' Look , we need a harpist . We ' ll give you lessons . ' And they sent me to this woman who just wouldn ' t let me stop - she hooked into me. ' ' // Before she knew it , she was called upon to substitute for her teacher in an orchestra ( ' ' terribly frightening ' ' ) and learn the repertoire . She took a concerto audition once - just for the experience - ' ' and no other harpists showed up ! ' ' she says . ' ' At a certain point , I felt I got my entire career by default ; nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody else came to the auditions , so I won it. ' ' // In college , Henson-Conant had only recently learned how to read music . She sometimes found herself in orchestra rehearsal gazing at the page and thinking , ' ' OK , it ' s a dot . . . it ' s on the third line . . . and it ' s got a hole in the middle of it . . . now what do I do ? ' ' ' // Fortunately , her mother , who was an opera singer , had taught her all about chords when Deborah was little . So in orchestra , she analyzed the chords and improvised on them . After one concert of ad-libbing , ' ' the conductor , instead of chastising me , actually made me take a bow afterwards . And I was shocked , and I thought , ' This is a little scary . ' ' ' But it was this skill that helped her jump from classical to jazz , she said. // When playing classical music in restaurants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen to the jazz musicians .

' ' Now , she ' s jamming with top bass players all the time - and getting more confident in her playing. // Her recordings include independently produced and distributed tapes - the most recent of which , ' ' ' Round the Corner , ' ' mixes jazz standards with her own compositions . A Boston Globe critic described the title song ( written by Henson-Conant ) as ' ' an ideal tableau for the harp ' s swing capabilities in her gifted hands. ' ' // ' ' I really thought I would encounter a lot of resistance from being a woman and from playing this strange instrument , ' ' said Henson-Conant . But everyone - from the audiences to the players - has been ' ' so supportive. ' ' // But she has had to ' ' break down ' ' her own uneasiness about her role in a jazz combo . Usually playing with men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has often felt awkward ' ' being the leader. ' ' // ' ' For so long I was constantly looking for approval from my players and that was completely inappropriate . My job is to listen to them and let them know what I want .
