There have been two disastrous days in the history of Washington 's Union Station . The first was Jan. 15 , 1953 , when a train hurtled beyond the tracks , through a newsstand and into the main concourse , where it smashed through the concrete floor and landed in the baggage room . Miraculously , no one was killed . The second was Feb. 29,1968 , when Congress decided to save the magnificent old building . From this intrusion , Union Station has never recovered . <P> Today , 20 congressional hearings and $83 million later , the station is closed , too dangerous to use . Parts of the roof have caved in . Leaking water has spread sepia stains on the gilt-edged ceilings and knocked loose hefty chunks of plaster . Pipes have burst , leaving muddy lakes . Toadstools grow from urinals and floors . Beneath 36 granite Roman soldiers encircling the balcony of the musty waiting room , rats and roaches prowl . <P> To reach their trains , passengers walk a zigzag detour one-third of a mile around the boarded-up building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . " This long walk is for the birds , " groused New Yorker Aileen Gravelle , 71 , dragging her suitcase along one muggy day . " And it used to be such a lovely station . " <P> Indeed it was . Union Station 's architect , Daniel H. Burnham , operated on a simple motto : " Make no little plans . " He modeled his beaux-arts palace on Rome 's Diocletian Baths and the triumphal Arch of Constantine . When it opened in 1907 , luxuriously appointed with mahogany , crystal , brass and marble , its 760-ft. - long , 45-ft. - high concourse was the largest room in the world under a single roof . Niches in the faade held carved avatars of fire , electricity , agriculture and mechanics , each weighing 25 tons . <P> But by 1960 , the falloff in rail travel had turned the white granite building into a mausoleum . The railroads were eager to raze it and put up an office building . There was no longer any need for a station that could support crowds of 175,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff of 5,000 to operate the city within the station : bowling alley , mortuary , bakery , butchery , YMCA hotel , ice house , resident doctor , liquor store , Turkish baths , first-class restaurant , basketball court , swimming pool , nursery , police station and silver-monogramming shop . <P> Preservationists had the station designated as a national landmark , making it virtually impossible to tear down . So the railroads offered it to the Federal Government . The National Park Service had been hankering for a place to tell tourists about the delights of the capital . It seemed a perfect match . In 1968 Congress enthusiastically passed the National Visitor Center Facilities Act . The bill called for the Department of the Interior to lease the building for $3.5 million annually for 25 years , after which the Government would own it . The owners of the terminal , the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore &; Ohio railroads , would spend $19 million for a parking garage , replacement terminal and conversion of the station into a visitor center . The bill 's sponsor , former Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style and patent-leather shoes , assured his colleagues that the annual rent could be recouped from parking fees and concessions .
