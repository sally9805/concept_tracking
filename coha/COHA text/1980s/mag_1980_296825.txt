For openers : Louis Comfort Tiffany , glassmaker extraordinary <P> Glassmaking is one of the oldest of crafts : it was an estimated 3,500 years ago that some unknown artisan in Mesopotamia pulled a chunk of quartz from a primitive furnace and found that it had become the fascinating molten glob that is glass . There has never been a single museum detailing and displaying this long history . The Corning Glass Works has remedied the situation by opening a stunning new museum in Corning , N.Y. , devoted to just this purpose . The building is worthy of its mission . It is an innovative and handsome structure designed by Architect Gunnar Birkerts , sheathed in paneled plate glass and laid out in the shape of a crazed clover leaf , a library in its center , a series of bays assigned to each of twelve major glassmaking styles . <P> The biggest bay is intended for special exhibits and , fittingly enough for the opening , it will be devoted to the work of the greatest of all U.S. glassmakers , Louis Comfort Tiffany . Specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and installed in his lavish house in Oyster Bay , N.Y . The house burned to the ground in 1957 , but somehow these windows survived and were bought by Hugh McKean , then president of Rollins College , and his wife Jeanette , a longtime Tiffany collector . With the windows , the McKeans set up a gallery near their home in Winter Park , Fla . Only after special pleas from Museum Director Thomas Buechner did they agree to lend the windows for Corning 's opening . <P> In return , Corning has provided a richly tasteful installation of dark interiors , where each window glows , offering opulent testimony to the improvements in Tiffany 's taste and technique as he grew in age and experience . The windows begin with panels that look like little more than paintings ( not very good ones , mostly of the Burne-Jones persuasion ) and go on to the increasingly abstract and incandescent color of Tiffany 's later works , such as Pumpkin and Beets , 1900-05 , as abstractly designed as any action painter might wish . Also on display is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( one recently brought $360,000 at auction ) . <P> The designs range from the most familiar , delicate lacery to a remarkable lamp studded with bizarre , irregular pieces of brown-green glass . The result looks like nothing so much as a bejeweled turtle . <P> Not even Tiffany , who was a vain man , could have anticipated the surge in the value of his work . But then he did not intend to be a glassmaker in the first place . He did not need to be . When he was born in 1848 , his father was already on his way to becoming the most famous jeweler in the land . But young Louis had no wish to take over the family business . He set out to be a painter , studying for a year with George Inness , rather than going to college . In the end he discovered that the arts and crafts movement founded by Britain 's William Morris and the Pre-Raphaelites was more to his taste ; their creed was that everyday utensils and decoration should be formed and shaped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time he was 31 , Tiffany had abandoned " pure " painting almost entirely to turn his talents to interior decoration and design , with a strong predilection for the Oriental simplicities and tastes preached by Whistler .
