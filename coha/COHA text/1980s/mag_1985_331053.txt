" It 's about the most beautiful place on the planet , " says a new resident , Megatrends Author John Naisbitt . When Bicycle Fortune Heir Richard Schwinn moved in eight years ago , he recalls , " it was like paradise . " But perhaps not for much longer . Laid-back little Telluride , Colo. , remote hideout for a smattering of the trendy rich and uncrowded preserve of ski connoisseurs , seems about to be discovered . The hills are alive with the sound of condo construction ; resort developers are poised on their bulldozers . And a big part of the reason is that the hippies who crash-landed there in the ' 70s have changed . Says Durfee Day , who arrived in 1969 : " Basically the whole town turned 40 . " <P> Telluride 's unique ambience and special magic are set picturesquely at the &; end of State Highway 145 in a box canyon some 350 difficult miles and a couple of decades southwest of Denver . But the onetime rip-roaring mining town in the San Juan Mountains has never quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of its banks , and William Jennings Bryan stopped off to say a few words . The local mines used to yield gold , silver and other precious metals , but the last of the major ones closed in 1978 . <P> The population had dwindled from 5,000 in the 1880s to 500 in the late 1960s , when political activists and dropouts looking for a Rocky Mountain high started moving in . Native Elvira Wunderlich , 70 , remembers the hippies as " just a bunch of trust funders and freeloaders . " But the newcomers brought along their political savvy and quickly commandeered the town council from the locals , known as the elks ( because of their frequent meetings at the Elks Club ) . Says former Mayor Jerry Rosenfeld , 44 , a Denver dropout from the Eugene McCarthy campaign : " We were going to build a utopia here . " <P> While the elks seethed , the hippies did their thing . They restored many of the Victorian jewel-box buildings ( the entire town was named a national historic district in 1963 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including one for mushrooms , sprang up ; the eleven- year-old Telluride film festival is one of the most respected in the U.S. Radio station KOTO still plays the marching music . " Some days you can hear 6 1/2 hours of Bob Dylan , " says Actress Susan Saint James , who came for the film festival and decided to buy a house five years ago . " It 's like a time warp . " Ever since the first ski trails and lifts were built in 1972 , developers have eyed the town 's secret chic for a major resort . In 1979 Telluride Ski Corp . ( Telco ) announced upscale Mountain Village : 92 acres of residences , hotels , a golf course and new intermediate runs , necessary to attract family-oriented baby boomers . The whole operation was to be built six miles and a mountainside away from Telluride , linked to the town by a high- speed European-style gondola.
