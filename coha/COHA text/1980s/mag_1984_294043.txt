Despite setbacks , the Ivory Coast remains a rare success story <P> For residents of Abidjan , the Ivory Coast 's modern capital , the crisis seemed to evolve with the inevitability of a malevolent natural force . Two months ago , the electricity in shops and office buildings began to flicker and die for an hour or so at lunchtime . Gradually , larger areas of the city went dark ; air conditioners , refrigerators and TV sets winked off . Now the entire city , as well as outlying coastal areas , is afflicted by crippling power outages . <P> The blackouts have spurred stinging broadsides from the press and public about government mismanagement . More important , they are causing concern that after two decades of prosperity , the Ivory Coast is lapsing into the kind of decay that has plagued so much of the continent . That worry seems to be exaggerated . " The Ivory Coast is an economic success even by Western standards , " says a Western diplomat in Abidjan . " Where else in Africa do you have the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for a few months ? The vast majority of Africans do n't even own them . " <P> The acute power shortage is the result of a two-year drought that has all but stilled the hydroelectric system , which supplies 92% of the country 's energy . Unfortunately , it occurred as the economy was already struggling with the effects of a slowdown that began in 1977 , when earnings from key exports , especially cocoa and coffee , dropped 40% . Without electricity , industrial capacity has plunged an estimated 35% . Construction is off 50% . Total business losses are officially placed at $80 million so far this winter , out of an annual G.N.P . of $10 billion . Lacina Coulibaly , president of an <P> Abidjan firm that manufactures jeans , guesses that his company 's forced switch to gas-oil generators has increased his overhead 250% . <P> In spite of the current setbacks , Abidjan 's skyline remains a tribute to the prosperity that has been generated under French-educated President Flix Houphout-Boigny , 78 , who has ruled the country since it became independent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the elliptical 30-story post office building , the modular Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et l'Industrie and the new Abidjan Hilton , the city 's profile is reminiscent of Florida 's Epcot Center . Traffic across the Pont Gnral De Gaulle bustles every bit as much as along the Arlington Memorial Bridge in Washington , D.C. , and even an occasional water skier can be spotted crisscrossing the wake of an outboard on the lagoon-like Cocody Bay . <P> Under Houphout-Boigny 's leadership , the Ivory Coast successfully developed a mixed economy that encouraged foreign investment , local private owner ship and economic diversification . Unlike many African leaders , he assiduously en couraged a strong agricultural sector and spent the money necessary to maintain roads , rural electrification and irrigation systems . Houphout-Boigny was also not afraid to keep strong ties with the country 's former colonial master . There are more French in the Ivory Coast now than when the country became independent .
