Ronald Reagan never made any secret of his distaste for affirmative action  --  the attempt to remedy past discrimination by giving preferential treatment to minorities . Last week , only days after Reagan left office , his goal of reining in such programs got a major boost from the Supreme Court . By a 6-to-3 vote , the court struck down a Richmond ordinance intended to guarantee blacks and other minorities a greater share of the city 's construction contracts . The decision not only threatened similar programs in 36 states but also potentially opened the door to legal attacks against other racially based government schemes . <P> The Richmond case began in 1983 , when the black-dominated city council approved an ordinance setting aside 30% of the dollar amount of its municipal projects for minority-owned construction firms . The council found that although Richmond 's population was half black , less than 1% of all public- works contracts had gone to minority firms . But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor , writing for the majority , charged that the city had not specifically proved a level of past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Connor : " An amorphous claim that there has been past discrimination in a particular industry can not justify the use of an unyielding racial quota . " Although the Richmond law was intended to help minorities , she argued , quota systems are inherently dangerous . <P> A key component of the court 's ruling was the requirement that all government distinctions based on race be subject to " strict scrutiny . " This means that public-sector affirmative-action programs are valid only if they serve the " compelling state interest " of redressing " identified discrimination . " Justice Thurgood Marshall , in a bitter dissent joined by Justices William Brennan and Harry Blackmun , called the decision " a deliberate and giant step backward in this court 's affirmative-action jurisprudence . " <P> Legal experts see trouble ahead for set-aside plans and other government- sponsored racial remedies . " It 's clear that affirmative-action programs will be harder to justify , " concludes Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School . Officials around the country expressed concern over how their plans would fare under the ruling .

Professor Charles Abernathy of Georgetown University Law Center attributes the court 's decision to the fear that as blacks take power in cities such as Richmond , laws will be passed to benefit blacks over whites . Observes Abernathy : " The court is saying that it wo n't stand for black leaders using power to reward their friends at the expense of others . " <P> Despite the new limitations , the death knell has not yet sounded for affirmative action . Last week 's decision did not affect plans by private companies to increase minority hiring , nor did it nullify the Federal Government 's set-aside program . Some experts , moreover , feel that local governments may be able to document past inequities in a way that would satisfy the court .
