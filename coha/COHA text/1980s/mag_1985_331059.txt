The 56-second tape was apparently filmed by the kidnapers on a home videocassette . Then it mysteriously came into the hands of Visnews , a British television news agency . And last week the footage , showing pale but well- groomed U.S. Diplomat William Buckley standing in front of a bare wall and holding a Beirut newspaper , appeared on TV screens across the U.S. " Today , the 22nd of January 1985 , I am well , and my friends Benjamin Weir and Jeremy Levin are also well , " said Buckley . " We ask that our Government take action for our release quickly . " In response , President Reagan assured reporters that efforts are continuing to free these and two other Americans kidnaped in Lebanon over the past eleven months . <P> State Department officials were far from delighted by the showing of the tape . According to Spokesman Bernard Kalb , publicity could " unnecessarily complicate ( the hostages ' ) release and perhaps endanger their safety . " Indeed , the State Department had seen a similar tape last July , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . <P> Buckley , 56 , is a political officer assigned to the U.S. embassy in Beirut . He was kidnaped as he left his apartment in Muslim-controlled West Beirut last March 16 by unidentified gunmen . Levin , 52 , Cable News Network 's Beirut bureau chief , was abducted from a busy West Beirut street about a week earlier . The kidnapers struck again last May 8 , seizing Weir , 60 , a Presbyterian minister , as he walked with his wife in the Muslim section . His wife was left behind unharmed . The two other missing Americans are Peter Kilburn , 60 , a librarian at the American University of Beirut who vanished on Dec. 3 , and Lawrence Jenco , 51 , a Roman Catholic priest and head of the Catholic Relief Services in the Lebanese capital , who was captured at gunpoint about four weeks ago . <P> Anonymous callers to Western news agencies have said that the U.S. captives will be released only when all Americans have departed from Lebanon . At least one caller has threatened that the five will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Intelligence Agency . Says one frustrated U.S. official : " We honestly do n't know for sure whom we are dealing with , or where the Americans are , or what we are supposed to do to get them . " <P> Some Washington officials speculate that at least some of the kidnapings were the work of Al Dawa ( the Call ) , an Iraqi Shi'ite fundamentalist group that is thought to have perpetrated the December 1983 bombings of the U.S. embassy and other targets in Kuwait . This would explain offers to free at least some of the Americans in exchange for the release of 17 Shi'ite terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait for the bombings . But many Western diplomats in Beirut believe that another Shi'ite organization , called Hizballah ( Party of God ) , might also be holding the Americans . Callers to Western news agencies have claimed responsibility for the abductions in the name of Islamic Jihad , which is believed to be a nom de guerre used by various shadowy Islamic fundamentalist terror groups .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
