The operation went off with military precision . At about 6 p.m . Wednesday , officers from the Dijin , a police special-operations team , hustled Eduardo Martinez Romero out the back door of a maximum-security Bogota jail while other officers distracted reporters and photographers gathered in front . Martinez , wanted in Atlanta in connection with a $1.2 billion money-laundering scheme , was taken aboard a jet owned by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and flown to his long-postponed rendezvous with U.S. justice . <P> With the extradition of Martinez , President Virgilio Barco Vargas proved his resolve in the battle against Colombia 's drug traffickers . Barco vowed to drive the dealers out of his country after the Aug. 18 murder of Senator Luis Carlos Galan , one of Colombia 's leading presidential candidates . Martinez , 34 , a reputed money manager for the Medellin cocaine cartel , was the first victim of Barco 's executive order reviving a U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty invalidated by the Colombian Supreme Court in 1987 . <P> Martinez was hustled to the federal courthouse in Atlanta early Thursday , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick list of charges accusing him of laundering millions of dollars for the cartel . If convicted , he could be sentenced to 30 years in prison . In Washington officials were exultant . " I applaud the extraordinary courage of President Virgilio Barco and the government of Colombia in their effort to restore the rule of law , " said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh . <P> But in Colombia others paid a high price for Barco 's boldness . Luz Amparo Gomez , 29 , a former investigator for the attorney general 's office who was involved in a legal action against drug kingpin Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha , was driving to her home when gunmen shot her to death . Hours later , the wife of a police major was gunned down outside her home . A day earlier , the wife of an intelligence officer attached to the 13th Brigade , the army unit that has spearheaded the crackdown , was murdered . <P> For the moment , the authorities are undaunted . At midweek Colombian television began running 30-second commercials featuring mug shots of Rodriguez Gacha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 million pesos  --  about $250,000  --  for information leading to their arrest . <P> Some American officials were still questioning whether Barco will follow through with new deportations in the face of both popular opposition and the terror campaign by the narcotraficantes . " As the cartel continues putting bombs here and there and appeals to nationalism , " said one State Department official in Washington , " Colombians are going to start asking , ' Why are we getting blown up just to satisfy the gringos ? ' " <P> But U.S. officials have concluded that the harsh Colombian campaign , for the moment at least , is having a real effect on the supply of cocaine in the U.S. " The cartels are having trouble getting cocaine out of Colombia , " said Pat O'Brien , outgoing chief of U.S. Customs in Miami . The government has seized so many of the traffickers ' planes and helicopters that they may be having difficulty moving the powder to Colombia 's northern coast , the main shipment point for cocaine . And on the drug-hungry streets of the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
