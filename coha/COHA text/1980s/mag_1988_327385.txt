Young contestants on the game show Double Dare compete for prizes by tossing clumps of mashed potatoes at one another , rummaging through huge pizzas and plunging down a sundae slide into a vat of whipped cream . Underage comics on You Ca n't Do That on Television assault one another with gag lines rather than food , but get drenched with a bucket of green slime every time they utter the phrase " I do n't know . " The action on Kids ' Court is only slightly more decorous . On one show a youngster stood accused of taking his brother 's water pistol and hiding it in the oven , where it melted . To help re-create the crime , the TV defendant grabbed a replica of the gun and raced around the studio squirting the audience . <P> We are a long way from Mr. Rogers ' neighborhood here , but antics like these have helped make Nickelodeon the hot address in children 's TV . Launched in 1979 , the cable channel for children is now seen in 41 million homes , double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest of all basic-cable services , are up 12% from last year . Along with its long-running show for preschoolers , Pinwheel , and a diet of cartoons and vintage reruns ( Lassie , Dennis the Menace ) , the channel is steadily boosting its slate of original programming aimed at older youngsters . The most successful , Double Dare , has become a hit in syndication and has spawned several imitators . Nickelodeon 's success with live-action children 's fare has even encouraged the networks to try out some new formats this fall in the Saturday-morning cartoon ghetto . <P> But Nickelodeon has done more than just come up with a winning formula ; it has found a distinctive voice . Nickelodeon shows are high-spirited without being silly , intelligent but not patronizing . They respect both kids ' sophistication and their sense of fun . " We 're not here to change kids or increase their reading scores , " says Geraldine Laybourne , a former grade- , school teacher who is Nickelodeon 's general manager . " We think it 's pretty tough being a kid today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single parent or both parents work . We ought to be a place where they can just relax , where kids can just be kids . " <P> What Nickelodeon has recognized , first of all , is that much of what makes kids kids is television . Nearly all the shows Nickelodeon has created are junior versions of adult programs . You Ca n't Do That on Television is a Laugh- In-like potpourri of sketches , blackouts and one-liners . Nick Rocks is a little-league MTV , and Do n't Just Sit There is a talk show geared to and hosted by youngsters . The opening of Kids ' Court slyly satirizes TV courtroom shows : two young " litigants " face the camera in dramatic closeup and state their beefs , then whirl and burst into the courtroom-studio to the cheers of an audience . Take that , Judge Wapner.
