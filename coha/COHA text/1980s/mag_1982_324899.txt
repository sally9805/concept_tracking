U.S.-Israeli relations are caught in a crossfire of harsh words <P> The rhetoric , observed a commentator in one of the year 's classic understatements , was not exactly " the linguistic currency to be used between heads of government . " Still , Menachem Begin 's angry words were apt symbols of the latest nadir in American-Israeli relations . Responding to a tough rebuke from the Reagan Administration , Israel 's choleric Prime Minister summoned U.S. Ambassador Samuel Lewis for a 72-minute tongue-lashing that was at once an irrational howl of defiance and a bleating cry of pain . <P> In Washington , the Administration 's public answer to Begin 's blast was soothing . " A disagreement among friends , " declared Secretary of State Alexander Haig . The official assumption was that the outburst was a spasm of momentary rage and that the special relationship with America 's prickly ally would return to something resembling normality in a matter of weeks . But the restoration would have to be on U.S. , not Israeli , terms . Said a ranking White House staffer : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary . " <P> The crossfire of reprisal and rhetoric was the explosive aftermath of Begin 's decision to push through the Knesset a law that in effect annexed the Golan Heights . Israel seized the 444-sq. - mi. area of high ground from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War . Reagan 's answer was to suspend a Memorandum of Understanding on Strategic Cooperation , signed by the U.S. and Israel last month to promote a coordinated defense against Soviet threats to the Middle East , and to postpone purchase of $200 million worth of Israeli-made military equipment . <P> In addition , the Administration announced it would vote for a Syrian-backed resolution before the United Nations Security Council to declare the annexation null and void . Said a State Department spokesman : " We do not recognize Israel 's action " and consider it to be " without international legal effect . " <P> The Administration bore its share of responsibility for the crisis by having failed to chart any kind of firm , long-range Middle East policy . Despite their expressed commitment to the Camp David accords , Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-stalled talks between Israel and Egypt on autonomy for the Palestinian Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Nor has the Administration been at all decisive in dealing with Israeli actions that were clearly contrary to U.S. interests . After Israel bombed the Iraqi nuclear reactor near Baghdad last June , the U.S. withheld a shipment of new fighter jets . But the embargo was lifted less than three months later , even though Israel had subsequently used American-supplied planes to bomb Beirut , killing at least 300.
