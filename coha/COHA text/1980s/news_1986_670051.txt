Oil prices rose for the seventh time in the past eight trading days on spot and futures markets amid continuing speculation of possible U.S. military action in Libya . Traders are wary of a possible supply disruption in the Middle East if the U.S. attacks the North African nation in retaliation for recent terrorist actions , analysts said . Navy Secretary John Lehman said the U.S. fleet is ready to strike at Libya if President Reagan orders it . " Our fleet is as ready today as it has ever been in our history , " Mr. Lehman said . The recent price rally , in which crude oil futures prices have jumped from $9. 75 to nearly $14 , " signals the beginning of the end of the free fall in oil prices , " said Richard Marose , analyst for Chicago-based Geldermann Inc . Mr. Marose and other analysts point out , however , that the market could test its recent lows if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries fails to reach an agreement to cut production at a conference scheduled for Tuesday . Many oil-industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reach such an accord . Crude oil prices for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 48 cents , to $13. 48 a barrel , in thin trading . Heating oil and gasoline contracts also posted gains . The May heating oil contract rose 2. 03 cents a gallon , to 42. 64 cents ; gasoline prices for May delivery jumped 1. 27 cents a gallon , to 44. 88 cents . On the spot , or noncontract , market , the price for West Texas intermediate , the U.S. benchmark crude , rose 50 cents a barrel , to $13. 50 . And the April price for North Sea Brent , the major European grade , rose 90 cents , to $13. 90 a barrel . Analysts also said other factors lent support to prices , including the continuation of the strike at Norway ' s North Sea oil operations . Norway ' s daily oil production of about 900 , 000 barrels has been halted since Sunday , when the caterers union walked out in a wage dispute . In addition , wire reports indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4. 1 million barrels a day during the first week of April , compared with a little more than five million barrels a day a month ago . And some oil industry observers said the market is in its typical " pre-OPEC meeting " rally ; traders are reluctant to take short positions for fear of a possible quota-setting agreement that would sharply raise prices , said Andrew Lebow , analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . , New York . Tightness in distillate supplies continues to contribute to firmness in gasoline and heating oil prices , analysts noted . Peter Beutel , assistant director of the energy group at Rudolf Wolff Futures Inc . , New York , said heating oil prices were buoyed by cold weather in the Northeast U.S. and in Europe . And because of a large drawdown in domestic gasoline inventories , coupled with increased demand , gas prices at the pump likely won ' t fall for much longer , said Geldermann ' s Mr. Marose . In other commodity markets yesterday : FOREIGN CURRENCIES : Major foreign currency futures prices closed sharply higher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to see the Japanese yen continue to rise against the dollar and other currencies . The minister , Nigel Lawson , said that view is the consensus among finance ministers of most major economic nations , except Japan . The dollar also was driven down by continued speculation that the Federal Reserve System will cut its discount rate soon , analysts said . The Swiss franc was bolstered again by traders ' beliefs that the Swiss government will maintain a stable monetary policy . LIVESTOCK AND MEAT : Cattle futures prices rose after the Agriculture Department said it would buy roughly 250 million pounds of red meat by August to offset the effect of its dairy herd buyout program . Under the program , the department will pay some dairy farmers to slaughter their herds ; fears that the program will lead to a meat glut torpedoed livestock futures last week . Most pork belly futures plunged by the maximum daily limit , as large cash market supplies depressed cash prices . Many traders and others have been discouraged from storing pork bellies recently , since a meat glut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer . That could lead to larger-than-normal supplies of fresh pork this summer , depressing demand for frozen pork bellies , said Chuck Levitt , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago . " Technical " factors watched by price-chart analysts fueled the selling . The weakness in the pork belly pit spilled over into hogs , pushing futures lower . Also , hog marketings on cash markets picked up after some meat packers raised their bids . SUGAR : Sugar futures prices plunged under a wave of selling at the close , with the July contract dropping almost 5/8-cent-a-pound , and deferred months , as much as their daily limit of 1/2 cent . Traders said a " vacuum " developed under the market as the selling touched off a mass of other sales orders . Initially , some support was derived from news that China had bought as many as 120 , 000 metric tons of raw sugar and concern that European beet sugar plantings have been delayed by wet weather . Late in the day , there was a report that Mexico had sold about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower-than-normal " quality at prices below levels prevailing in the world market . At first , the price was regarded as about in line with world-market values , in view of the quality of the sugar ; but later the sale increasingly was viewed as a depressant because the quantity sold by Mexico was more than expected , sources said . One trader said he believed that a significant amount of the late selling might represent hedging by buyers of the Mexican sugar .
