Their struggle , now more than a decade old , has been brought to a new intensity by Robert Sands , a 27-year-old member of the Irish Republican Army who was elected to Parliament while confined to the Maze Prison at Long Kesh outside Belfast . He is reported to be near death as the result of a 57-day hunger strike. // In a preview of the trouble that is generally anticipated if Mr. Sands dies , hundreds of Catholics clashed with troops in Belfast today after it became clear that the intervention of the European Human Rights Commission had failed to end the hunger strike . Two members of the commission left the jail last night after seven hours , without having seen Mr. Sands. // // Short Skirmish With Soldiers // The skirmish here , in which security forces fired plastic bullets and demonstrators threw stones , was relatively brief and caused no serious injuries . It did not affect a huge parade down the Falls Road , the main artery of the Catholic section of Belfast , by 20 , 000 supporters of the hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Andersonstown , where they heard speeches denouncing the British as well as Charles Haughey , Ireland ' s Prime Minister , who helped to arrange the visit of the rights envoys. // In north London , the police broke up a demonstration in support of Mr. Sands before marchers could set off . The march would have been in violation of a 28-day ban on public protests in the capital , prompted by riots in Brixton , by William Whitelaw , the Home Secretary . About 30 people were arrested . Several others were taken into custody at a rally outside 10 Downing Street , the residence of the British Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher . <> <> M.P. Receives Letter Bomb // It was disclosed this morning , meanwhile , that Barry Porter , a Member of Parliament who asked questions about the hunger strike in the House of Commons before the Easter recess , had received a letter bomb at his home . It did not explode. // Members of Mr. Sands ' s family said they had been told that he almost died last night and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His sight and hearing are said to be failing , and he is reportedly only able to talk for short periods before having to pause to regain his strength. // It was Mr. Sands ' sister , Marcella , who asked the European Human Rights Commission to intervene in the case in a last attempt to avoid the prisoner ' s death and the turmoil that is expected to ensue . She acted after meeting with Mr. Haughey in Dublin. // Karl-Aage Norgaard of Denmark , one of the visiting commissioners , said the initiative had failed because Mr. Sands had declined to associate himself with a petition drawn up by his sister . Under the commission ' s rules , the person claiming that his or her human rights have been infringed is required to ask personally for the organization ' s help. // Protestants in Ulster have been outraged by the attention given to Mr. Sands ' protest . Edith Elliott , a Protestant whose husband and brother have been murdered , has filed a complaint of her own with the commission , and 200 Protestants picketed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ask , " Did 2 , 000 dead have any human rights ? " <> <> Complex Set of Considerations // A complex set of political and tactical considerations have brought Ulster to the boil once again after a period of relative peace . For most of last year the Irish Republican Army was on the defensive . As a result of improved cooperation between the British and the Irish republic , large quantities of arms and bombs were seized , and important operatives were imprisoned - " not just drivers , but planners as well , " as one security source said this weekend. // The hunger strike by Mr. Sands , a previously little-known figure , and by three others , was the I.R.A. ' s response . In theory , the strikers are seeking political status , which Mrs. Thatcher refused last week to grant with the terse comment , " Crime is crime is crime . " Mr. Sands is serving a 14-year sentence for the illegal possession of arms. // In fact , the strike has as its real goal the generation of publicity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among Irish-Americans . An I.R.A. official commented , " We want to remind people that we are still here , still determined , and that we still need their help . " The ultimate aim is to persuade the British to withdraw from the province , which has a substantial Protestant majority . <> <> Quiet but Crucial Role // Mr. Haughey ' s role has been quiet but , in recent days , a crucial one . His standing in the public opinion polls has been dropping , just at the moment when he was planning to call a general election . He came to office with a pledge to improve Ireland ' s economic situation , which he has been unable to do , and to " do something " about the troubles in Ulster . A new spasm of violence here would cripple his campaign hopes. // He therefore persuaded the Sands family to call in the Human Rights Commission , sources in Dublin say , hoping that the commission could convince Mr. Sands to call off his strike . For the same reason , Mrs. Thatcher privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday. // But the Catholic militants feared that the termination of the hunger strike would put them back on the defensive , with little to show for Mr. Sands ' s suffering and their renewed organizational efforts . They encouraged Mr. Sands to persevere and passed the word that the family had been " misled " by Mr. Haughey , a theme echoed by the speakers at today ' s rally. // " The I.R.A. needs a martyr , " a Belfast journalist said . " Martyrs are the stuff of Irish revolutionary politics. " <> <> 10 Nights of Protests // In Catholic sections of Belfast and in Bogside in Londonderry , Ulster ' s second-largest city , youthful demonstrators have spent most of the last 10 nights hurling stones and petroleum and acid bombs at troops and policemen . The security forces have replied with plastic bullets , hard projectiles about an inch in diameter and six inches long. // But neither side appears willing yet to take a chance on using greater force . As a result , only three people have died , all demonstrators : two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd early last week , and a 15-year-old boy , Paul Witters , who died yesterday after having been struck by a plastic bullet during a clash in Londonderry. //
