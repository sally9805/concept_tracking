The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City routinely plays host to Presidents , Prime Ministers and tycoons . But even for that glittering hostelry , the lavish auto show that General Motors put on last week was something special . During a three-day extravaganza , punctuated by a black-tie dinner and bubbly receptions , an army of executives and engineers greeted some 16,000 invited guests : GM stockholders and workers , Wall Street analysts , suppliers , mayors , even teachers and schoolchildren . On display in the Waldorf ballrooms was a dizzying array of 24 GM cars and trucks , ranging from the rugged GMC Sierra Pickup to the sleek solar-powered Sunraycer that won the 1,950-mile World Solar Challenge race across Australia in November . <P> The spectacular road show and an accompanying ad campaign , which reportedly cost GM a total of $20 million , are an unabashed effort to polish up the company 's rusty image during a period of declining sales and slumping profits and to bolster employee morale after a two-year wave of layoffs . Kicking off the affair with what he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 , asserted that GM is rebuilding consumer confidence in its cars with competitive pricing , superior technology and eye-catching style . The vehicles around him , Smith said , were proof of a " GM that can maintain its world leadership , a GM that all of us can continue to be proud of . " <P> GM won mixed reviews for its show , which its employees dubbed " Rogerama , " a reference to the splashy Motorama auto shows that the company held at the Waldorf a generation ago . Said Thomas J. Peters , a management consultant and co-author of the best-selling book In Search of Excellence : " This show is pathetic in the deepest sense of the word . GM does not have a p.r . problem , it ; has a car problem . " Peters and other detractors maintain that consumers have been turned off by GM 's lack of innovation and its look-alike designs , which have made it hard to tell a Chevrolet Celebrity from the more expensive Buick Century . <P> Although last year was tough for all American automakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. fell some 21% , from 4.7 million in 1986 to 3.7 million in 1987 , Ford sales declined only 1% , to 2 million cars . In just one year , GM 's U.S. market share shrank from 41% to 37% , while Ford 's grew from 18% to 20% . Moreover , by earning more on each car , Ford continued to rack up bigger profits than its much larger rival . Through the first nine months of 1987 , GM earned $2.7 billion on revenues of $75.4 billion , but Ford cleared $3.7 billion on $52.9 billion . <P> Smith maintains that GM will soon emerge from its painful corporate restructuring as a leaner , more efficient and much more profitable company . Since 1986 the company has eliminated nearly 30,000 salaried employees , or about 4% of its work force , and has begun closing down operations at 16 plants . But it has also invested $50 billion to build eight new plants and modernize 19 others . Says GM President Robert Stempel , 54 : " That 's the long- term approach . Roger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he didn't. "
