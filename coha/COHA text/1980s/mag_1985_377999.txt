A mint-condition Queen Anne highboy or Paul Revere candlesticks may be coveted objects to the average antique hound . But two chemists with the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico are tracking down a more unusual relic : old air . Allen Ogard and Jane Poths are seeking samples of air that was sealed off decades or even centuries ago . Reason : to determine whether the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased in the two centuries since the start of the industrial revolution . By some calculations , the extensive burning of oil and other fossil fuels has added to the shield of carbon dioxide around the earth , resulting in a heightened greenhouse effect that traps heat and changes weather patterns . <P> During the chemists ' eight-month hunt , they scouted 19th century riverboats and pawed through the dusty corners of historical museums . The most promising sources are objects that were originally sealed against moisture , such as navigational compasses , hourglasses , sextants and telescopes . Other possibilities include buried time capsules , hollow building cornerstones , miniature globes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Missouri River in the mid-1800s . Two venerable Connecticut companies , which have manufactured hollow brass military buttons since the War of 1812 , have offered to supply buttons spanning two centuries . " This gives us samples from many different periods of time , " says Poths , " and all manufactured in one place . " Some efforts , however , have been disappointing . The researchers had high hopes for a collection of ancient cremation vessels from a Buddhist mission in Hawaii , only to find that the lids were loose . Sighs Ogard : " Most things that can be opened have been . " <P> To determine if a button or sextant is permeable , the investigators place the object in a container filled with neon , then later examine the item with a mass spectrometer to see if neon has entered it . If the object proves snug , its carbon dioxide is analyzed . Such an operation may require drilling a small hole through the antique object , but surprisingly , museum curators have not protested . Says Ogard : " Most have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an obvious place . "
