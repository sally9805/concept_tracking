Commuters from the north of Boston rarely have a difficult time driving to within two miles of the city on weekday mornings . But from there on in , thanks to the Charles River Basin and Boston Harbor , the going gets heavy . Once the hapless motorist arrives in East Boston , Charlestown , or Cambridge , the options for getting downtown are few and inevitably crowded . And to make matters worse , it often seems to harried commuters that , in years past , Boston traffic planners joined with nostalgia buffs to " increase " alternate routes into town with an ingenious hoax by simply giving every existing commuter route into Boston additional names . The result , at least for the uninitiated , is that there appear to be more ways to get there than there actually are , depending on who ' s giving directions . Here ' s an example : Coming in on 93 , you hear the radio traffic reports announce that the lower deck ( 93 southbound into the Central Artery ) is backed up to Assembly square ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ve been around , the new shopping mall you may have seen plugged on TV , and about where Rte. 28 intersects 93 if you ' re reading a map ) . Thinking ahead , you get off at Mystic avenue in Somerville , and make your way via Broadway to Sullivan Square in Charlestown . Proceeding south on Rutherford avenue , you are warned by the radio that cars on the Charlestown bridge are stalled bumper to bumper . Even if you were to wait it out , you ' d have to deal with the daily free-for-all in front of Polcari ' s restaurant . You ' re not in a fighting mood , and since the middle lane on that bridge is unofficially given to whoever ' s bravest - you or the northbound fellow leaving town , you decide to try to get around the problem . " The Gilmore bridge to the McGrath and O ' Brien highway looks good , " crackles the radio . A quick look at the map , and you can ' t find it . But if you knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point bridge , and that they ' re both called Charlestown avenue , your map would have been more helpful . Just as you finally take a left on O ' Brien highway ( it ' s Msgr . O ' Brien in Cambridge , Msgr . McGrath in Somerville , and Rte. 28 inboth places ) , the radio lets you know that " Leverett circle is all backed up - at least a 10 minute delay . " Charles River a problem Regardless of where you wish to go now , Leverett Circle comes first . You probably should have stayed on 93 . Dave Hemenway of Metro Traffic Control ( MTC ) , says , " Alternate routes are only important in the event of something extraordinary that doesn ' t happen all the time . " Since getting across the Charles River Basin and the harbor into Boston in the morning is normally a struggle everywhere , only when a major accident has blocked your normal route is it likely to be helpful to look for alternatives , Hemenway says . Metro Traffic Control is a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 11 other cities ) and sells its 10-90 second reports to subscribing radio and television stations . Using mobile units , observation stations atop the Prudential and Harbor Towers , and a helicopter , MTC is able to offer traffic information which is never more than 5 minutes old ( written contracts with radio stations prohibit stations from broadcasting older reports ) . The company has compiled average driving times between a variety of points along commuter routes , and gives current times in many of its reports , which enable listening commuters to compare a looming delay with known alternatives . In the accompanying chart are listed some driving times for North Shore routes . Because these times are compiled at times of day when traffic is normal or light , they can be used as a benchmark against which to compare rush hour delays reported on the radio . For example , driving home at night , a Lynn motorist knows that , in the absence of delays , it ' s a little faster to take the Tobin bridge and Rte. 16 ( Revere Beach parkway ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callahan tunnel . Hearing of delays on either route , he can make a decision based on currently reported travel times . Commuters from the north who are willing to vary their routes into Boston in the morning normally make decisions as they cross Rtes. 60 and 16 , the two principal roads which cross the spokes of the Hub ' which are the alternatives . Rte. 60 is usually a poor choice for two reasons : it is farther from Boston , making the distances crossing to alternate routes longer , and it is a smaller road that Rte. 16 . Rte. 16 connects Rtes. 1A , 107 , 1 , 99 , 28 and 93 within 4 miles of downtown , and eventually reaches the western approaches to Boston . Depending on exactly where one wants to end up , and on daily traffic conditions , choices can be made , but Hemenway says rush hour traffic usually equalizes delays among various routes quickly . However , both Rte. 93 and the Sumner Tunnel are prone to southbound delays during evening rush hour , when the general flow might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m. , the southbound secondary routes are often clear . But for the forseeable future , in the absence of a third Harbor tunnel or other improvements in getting across the Charles and through the Central Artery , North Shore commuters can count on a lot of options - all tedious.Someaverage driving times for North Shore routesBased on normal or light trafficHour From To Trip time 11 am Rte. 1 in Saugus Tobin Bridge 7 minutes 2 pm Sumner Tunnel , East Boston exit at 93 1 minutes 2 pm Medford square Central Artery via 93 11 minutes 2 pm Medford ctr. at Rte. 28/93 Rte. 28 in Somerville , 93 3 minutes10 am Tobin Bridge Suffolk Downs 6 minutes11 am Tobin Bridge N.E.
