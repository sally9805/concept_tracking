 | The person who would most adore the Andy Warhol auction is the late Andy Warhol himself . In what may be the biggest garage sale ever , his massive collection of art , furnishings and popculture tchotchkes will be auctioned off over 10 days , beginning April 23 , at Sotheby 's in New York . Already the sale is shaping up to be the ultimate Warhol event , a donnybrook of celebrity , money and hype . Given the range of the nearly 10,000 objects to be sold ? from rare antiques to flea-market junk ? it is bound to attract both serious collectors and pop-eyed fans of America 's most famous artist . Sotheby 's estimates the sale will bring up to $15 million , but the total may well soar much higher . What will go on the block , after all , wo n't be just a picture or a chair or a teapot , but a glittering chip off the Warhol legend . The Warhol sale is the latest emblem of the art world 's shift away from esthetic concerns into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To merchandise Warhol 's vast jumble of objets d'art , his estate turned to the well-oiled selling machinery of Sotheby 's , the world 's largest artauction house . Sotheby 's has never handled an estate with more stuff in it than Warhol 's . Just to inventory all the items took several weeks , and the presale viewing will fill three floors of the auction house . The objects have been grouped into 3,000 lots , with bid estimates based on the market value of comparable pieces . ( No premium was added to reflect the Warhol provenance . ) To spark initial interest , the auction house published a glossy , six-volume , slipcased catalog months in advance and is selling it through bookstores ? a first ? for $95 . The firm assembled an exhibition of 70 of the finest objects ? from Salvador Dali ear clips to a Kwakiutl mask ? to tour Sotheby branches in Los Angeles and Chicago . Jewelry was sent to @# Palm Beach and New Orleans . At each stop , parties and previews were tossed for important clients and press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tokyo to rev up foreign bidding . In Japan ? where Western art auctions are attracting more clients , especially given the strong yen ? people gawked at Andy 's stuff in the Seibu department store . Sotheby 's somber London headquarters was mobbed by spike-haired trendies during the exhibition there . " Everyone wants a bit of Andy Warhol , " marveled a security guard . Sotheby 's officials planned the sale over 10 days to accommodate a huge swarm of bidders and curiosity seekers . The approach is democratic : for the first time , the house will hold an auction session on a Sunday ? for the lower-priced collectibles and pop-culture artifacts ? so that just plain folks can attend . A how-to flier has been prepared for first-time bidders . Telephone @# @# @#  | lines will be open to clients all over the world . Truman Capote once called Warhol " a sphinx with no secret , " but he was wrong . The artist himself claimed that everything to know about him was on " the surface of my paintings and films and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart attack following gallbladder surgery , pop art 's bad boy turned out to have squirreled away all sorts of clues to his life and art . The biggest secret revealed was his deepest passion : Warhol loved to shop . Almost no one had known the full extent of his amazing acquisitiveness . He collected everything from soup bowls to nut jars . He bought paintings , art deco furniture , classical sculpture , photographs , ' 40s jewelry , Navajo rugs , ' 50s cookie jars . " Andy had no pretensions to connoisseurship , " Frederick W. Hughes , Warhol 's longtime business associate and executor of his will , writes in the auction catalog . " If American Indian baskets attracted him , he suddenly wanted lots of them . To him it was all so much fun , and he would act like an excited child . " Sotheby 's chief promotional tool has been the weird Warhol mystique . " It 's always easier to sell if you have something that has human interest attached to it , " says the firm 's ebullient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Stressing the Warhol connection ? the catalog is laced with cozy anecdotes , quotes and essays by Warhol chums ? blurs the startling incongruities and uneven quality of the collection . Flip though the jewelry catalog , for example . Among the entries for hundreds of vintage wristwatches ? a gold Patek Philippe , circa : 1947 , estimated to fetch $5,000 to $6,000 , or a 1930 lady 's Cartier , estimated at $2,000 to $3,000 ? is a plastic Fred Flintstone watch in a lot , estimated at $50 to $60 , that includes two other novelty timepieces " bearing original Bloomingdale 's price tags . " Rather than sell lowticket items in a tag sale , as Sotheby 's has sometimes done in estate auctions , the house is auctioning even the cheapest lots , banking on hoards of fans to bid up prices in their lust for Warho : memorabilia . Indeed , selling Warhol is a pitchman-s dream . Sotheby 's promoted the sale to special clients by throwing a series of parties at Warhol 's Manhattan home ? an especially coveted invitation since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threshold during his lifetime . Of course , the place had to be tidied up a bit first . The five-story town house was so crammed with stuff at the time of his death that Warhol was living mostly in his bedroom . Cartons and shopping bags full of purchases had never been unpacked . Jewelry was found in cookie tins ; a Picasso was stuck in a closet . Another closet was stuffed to the top with stunning Navajo blankets . When Sotheby 's finally put the rooms in order and filled them with fresh flowers , the house looked more like the domain of a dowager than @#  | the nest of the man who revolutionized modern art by pa : Ming Campbell 's soup cans . The mahogany dining-room table was laid with silver service plates ? though Warhol had preferred to eat his favorite supper of turkey and mashed potatoes off Fiesta ware in the kitchen . Still , the furnishings amazed almost everyone . Decorated by Warhol 's friend Jed Johnson during the 1970s , the house was cluttered with somber American 19th-century antiques , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned stenciling . Not a single Warhol art work hung on the walls . The artist himself slept in a Federal four-poster bed with an ornate canopy ( in which valuable jewelry was found hidden after his death ) , and he kept the jeans he always wore in an 1815 mahogany wardrobe . A crucifix was on the bedside table . The room was also furnished , of course , with a giant console TV set and VCR . Elsewhere , a parlor was dominated by heavy Empire furniture and a guest room decorated with 19th-century bird's-eye maple . The exception to this look was the fabulous art deco sitting room , where contemporary paintings by Roy Lichtenstein , Jasper Johns and Cy Twombley hung on the walls . The rare French furniture of the 1920s and ' 30s from this room and the adjacent hallway are among the auction 's highlights ? especially the unusual sharkskin and sycamore wood pieces made around 1920 by Pierre Legrain . A pair of Legrain console tables are estimated to fetch $40,000 to $60,000 each . Warhol 's legendary Factory , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interview , was also full of " old stuff , " as the artist called it . The Eurotrash , punk rockers and society kids who mingled at the famous daily luncheons at the Factory sat on elegant art deco chairs by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann , circa 1926 , which are estimated to bring up to $15,000 for each set of four . Warhol collected hundreds of chairs of every variety ? from Adirondack porch chairs made of twigs to a circa 1900 yellow vellum rocker by Carlo Bugatti ( father of the car designer ) to Charles Eames 's ' 50s chairs of molded fiber glass . But why is everything Warhol collected being sold ? The Factory is so denuded the estate 's administrators have n't much to perch on . " I 'm now sitting at the kind of desk you find in the basement of a high school , " says Ed Hayes , the estate attorney , who happens to have been the model for the colorful lawyer Tom Killian in Tom Wolfe 's best-selling satire " The Bonfire of the Vanities . " The primary beneficiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Visual Arts , which will award grants mainly to art institutions . By law , such a foundation must disperse 5 percent of its assets a year and , according to Hayes , " The auction is the most cost-efficient way to sell the non-Warhol art . We have to raise money to give away the 5 percent . " Maybe Warhol was trying to throw the world off his scent when he once whined , " I 'm always interested in the right thing at the wrong H E A R T S  | time . " It was n't true , of course , in either his art or his shopping . Between his uncannily sharp eye and his love of a bargain , he managed to be right on time ? one step ahead of the next hot trend in collecting . " He collected in phases , " explains Fred Hughes . " It had a lot to do with the practical ? where he was , where his fancy took him . That was part of the fun . " When American folk art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . When he was picking up art deco pieces at the flea market in Paris , no one else yet cared . In New York , he squeezed a daily shopping trip in between his morning telephone calls and lunch at the Factory . " You go every day , or you miss something , " explains Stuart Pivar , a collector who haunted the Madison Avenue dealers , Sunday flea markets and auction rooms with Warhol . Among the lots in the Sotheby 's sale , in fact , are 400 of Warhol 's auction catalogs , marked up with his notes . But if he loved the hunt for an eye-catching piece , he loved swapping most of all . " Andy loved to horse-trade , " says Pivar , " especially trading things against his own work . " When Warhol did Pivar 's portrait , his friend gave him art in return , including the campy 19th-century harem scene attributed to Georges Clairin that hung in a guest room of the town house ( estimated at $40,000 to $60,000 in the sale ) . Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pivar for Norman Rockwell 's portrait of Jackie Kennedy ( estimated at $8,000 to $12,000 ) . Warhol 's collecting mania may look haphazard , but each craze had links to the art that he was making . When Warhol was buying American folk portraits , dealer Ronald Feldman remembers , he talked excitedly about what it must have been like for an itinerant 19th-century portraitist to ride into a new town and find commissions among the local gentry . " At that same time , Andy was taking his Polaroid camera around and making portraits , " says Feldman . " Instead of a horse , he had a Polaroid , but he was just a local artist doing the same work . " Much of the stuff Warhol collected ? from a 19th-century oculist 's sign to an outsize Coke bottle used for display ? reflects the interest in advertising and packaging by the artist who immortalized the Brillo box and celebrated mass culture with his images of Marilyn and Elvis . Warhol used his collections of stuff such as chalkware dogs and Puss ' n ' Boots cookie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste . " " Andy was like a real archeologist , " says his friend Paige Powell , advertising director of Interview . " He really had a sense of capturing a moment in time . " Some observers insist the collection is an artistic statement in itself and ought to be kept together ? Powell has even tried to interest an individual or corporation in buying it all up . But when Marion takes the podium at Sotheby 's to begin the first auction , the house is likely to be packed with competing bidders . " It 's amazing the number of people who are touched by Warhol and want to view the presale and bid , " says Jeffrey Deitch of the international art advisory service at Citibank . " I know a number of people who would n't ordinarily go to an auction who want something that belonged to Andy . " " There 's a very strong feeling that the prices are going to be triple or quadruple the estimates , " says one friend , writer Tama Janowitz . But too much presale hysteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection really justify all the fuss ? Which is the winner here , art or hype ? The irony of the mania surrounding the auction is that even Warhol fans admit that the quality of the collection varies wildly . " It 's not very good , " says critic Henry Geldzahler , who plans to bid on something in order to have a memento . The jewelry , the American Indian artifacts and the art deco furniture are the collection 's great strengths . But the contemporary art ? with the exception of a few paintings such as Roy Lichtenstein 's pop classic , " Laughing Cat " ? is " pretty thin on the top end , " says collector Daniel Wolf , who is going to bid on American Indian material . " Andy bought interesting things , but not great things . " Deitch puts it this way : " These interesting and humble objects will all get their 15 minutes of fame . The collection is an extension of Warhol 's democratic esthetic . " It 's doubtful that the auction will mark the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $15 million , may actually be worth several times as much , with the added value of real estate in New York City , Long Island and Colorado , of Interview magazine and of Warhol 's own art . Prices for his work have escalated since his death . Top paintings have sold privately for more than $1 million , according to dealer Feldman . Foi , now , the estate has a lock on most of his late work . The Warhol retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art , opening next February , probably wo n't still the long-running controversy over his work but will do nothing to hurt his prices . And when the last lot is knocked down at Sotheby 's , the Warhol estate still will have plenty of detritus . Within a year Warner 's Books will publish Andy 's diaries ? his editor and friend Pat Hackett is boiling 10,000 pages down to 1,000 . ( The estate got a $1.2 million advance . ) And there are masses of other documentation by the obsessive recorder of pop culture . What about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decades of Polaroid pictures he took ? What about the hundreds of time capsules he made of junk mail , unopened gifts , souvenirs and newspapers that he tossed into cartons , dated and sealed up ? This was the true archeological sensibility at work ? except that instead of the Dead Sea scrolls , future generations will find old copies of the New York Post . In the end , Warhol 's enormous accumulation of possessions , like those of Orson Welles 's " Citizen Kane , " tell everything and nothing about their possessor , the strange silver-wigged figure who proclaimed everything " great . " Warhol once said : " I want to live in a studio . In one room . That 's what Ive always wanted , to not have anything ? to be able to get rid of all my junk . " At last he is getting rid of all his " junk . " The Warhol auction is the perfect validation of the artist who said that good business was the finest art of all .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
