A radical returns to power <P> It could have been the last hurrah for one of Western Europe 's best-known socialist leaders . " Much is at stake for Olof Palme , " wrote a top Swedish political columnist . " It is a question of winning or disappearing . " During six years in political exile , former Prime Minister Palme , 55 , crisscrossed the globe as a spokesman for disarmament groups and a mediator in the Iran-Iraq war . This summer , however , he reverted to his familiar role of politician , as he sought to avenge successive defeats that have deprived his Social Democratic Party from governing the cradle-to-grave welfare society that it built during 44 years in power . <P> When the votes were tallied in the Sunday election , Palme had won what some observers called his " first real victory " in 13 years as party leader . The Social Democrats swept back to power by winning 166 seats against a combined total of 163 seats for the three-party non-Socialist bloc . <P> Palme won the support of Swedish voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official jobless rate stands at only 3.7% , Palme contended that it was " moving toward 4% or 5% , a tiny rate in many countries , but one that Swedes wo n't stand for . " In Norrbotten , the region with the highest official unemployment rate in the country ( 8.5% ) , the Social Democrats won nearly two-thirds of the vote . Palme also castigated the center-liberal government 's program of welfare cuts designed to slow down growing deficits , which contribute to giving Swedes the world 's highest tax burden . <P> The Social Democrats ' resurgence seemed less a reflection of voter sympathy for a move back to the left than an expression of public disenchantment with the austerity policies of outgoing Prime Minister Thorbjrn Flldin .

He cut back on such popular measures as pensions , sick pay and subsidies for rent and food . The subsequent outcry virtually ensured last week 's election to the Social Democrats . <P> Once in office , Palme hopes to apply his party 's free-spending credo as a panacea for Sweden 's sluggish economy . He promised to cancel planned cuts in sick pay and to increase funding for child-care centers . Unemployment compensation and pensions will be raised to keep up with inflation . In addition , Palme has proposed a mammoth $320 million government investment scheme to build new roads , bridges and housing projects that he believes will generate up to 40,000 new jobs . To finance the programs , the Social Democrats want to hike the country 's 21.5% sales tax by another 2%.
