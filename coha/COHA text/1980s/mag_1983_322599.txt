Under pressure , two rival teachers ' unions reconsider old policies <P> They made a distinctly odd couple . There was Albert Shanker , president of the American Federation of Teachers and leader of the five-week New York City teachers ' strike in 1968 , standing beside President Reagan , whom Shanker had bitterly opposed in the 1980 election . Reagan is dedicated to granting tuition tax credits for private schooling and is determined to cut federal aid to public education . The A.F.T . is strongly opposed to both ideas . Indeed , just the day before Reagan 's address last week in Los Angeles , Shanker issued a report card on the President and gave him an F+ ( the plus for at least putting educational reform on the national agenda ) . But when Shanker invited Reagan at the assembly to meet the people " who have been fighting for excellence in education , " the President applauded the teachers . And when Reagan spoke of the need to raise standards and become " partners in public school revival , " the teachers-and Shanker-applauded him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to exploit a growing national concern about the need to improve public schools . He was also indicating a willingness to collaborate with the A.F.T. , which represents 580,000 school employees , perhaps furthering a split in the teachers ' union movement . Said the President : " I know that there 's another pretty big education organization out there . But it has been my experience that dedication , open-mindedness and initiative count for as much as size . The A.F.T. , like Avis , tries harder . " <P> As he spoke , the Hertz of teachers ' unions was meeting in Philadelphia . The National Education Association , which represents 1.7 million school employees , controlled the largest bloc of delegates and alternates at the 1980 Democratic Convention . Diametrically opposed to Reagan 's policies , the N.E.A. last week played host to five Democratic presidential hopefuls . The mood of the delegates at the N.E.A. meeting was defensive . Said outgoing N.E.A. President Willard McGuire : " We 've often been accused of speaking to our self-interests , seeking to reduce our work loads or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of malarkey . " Shanker might have been warning the N.E.A. not to dig in its heels when he told his own convention , " We are living in dangerous times . Education is under attack . " <P> The past few years have been hard for the unions . Diminishing state revenues have left many school districts unable to meet their budgets and forced some to reduce teaching staffs . During 1982-83 , there were only 87 teacher strikes , compared with 242 just three years earlier , largely because teachers have realized that they can not shake money out of empty coffers . This spring a report by the National Commission on Excellence in Education found that teacher training programs needed substantial improvement and that too few top students are attracted to the profession . While urging that all salaries be raised , the commission proposed that superior teachers be rewarded with merit increases , a concept traditionally opposed by both unions on the ground that such bonuses might be awarded unfairly .                 @ @ @ @
