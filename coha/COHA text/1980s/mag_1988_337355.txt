When the coaches of the Eintracht professional soccer team in Frankfurt , West Germany , went shopping for a top star to boost their squad 's flagging performance , they first considered the usual procedure : raiding the rosters of their West European competitors . Then Eintracht 's scouts decided to look east , and a powerful young Hungarian soon caught their eye . As it happened , the sports authorities in Communist Hungary were delighted to discuss trading a winning player for hard currency . After weeks of bargaining , the two sides cut a deal . Last fall Hungary 's top star , Lajos Detari , 24 , began playing in West Germany on a three-year contract worth $2 million . <P> The lucrative deal was among hundreds struck in the past few years in a booming sector of East-West trade : the hawking of East European talent to the West for cash or merchandise . Polish soccer goalies , Czechoslovak hockey forwards and East German handball coaches are only part of the business . Such athletes have been joined by thousands of other performers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a diva at the prestigious Milan and Vienna opera houses , to Hungarian gypsy bands , Polish striptease artists , Bulgarian pop singers and Rumanian high-wire circus acts . Although the East bloc governments refuse to disclose the revenues they reap from the talent trade , Western economists estimate that contracts for 1986 alone may have amounted to $100 million . Says a Hungarian trade official : " People are one of the few commodities we can sell easily in the West . " <P> The region 's conventional exports suffer a reputation for second-rate quality : outdated electronic calculators , low-grade steel , shoddy carpeting . But the East bloc 's human exports are often top of the line . Many of the most talented performers have been trained from as young as age six at rigorous state-run sports or music institutions . Other stars , circus artists among them , possess skills that are centuries-old specialties of Eastern Europe . Yet Communist governments are so hungry for hard currency to help finance growing debts to Western lenders and pay for imported products that they routinely mark down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate for similarly skilled performers from the West . The artists and athletes benefit by gaining a share of the hard-currency income as well as enhanced reputations and the coveted freedom to travel outside the bloc . The state benefits by taking a cut that can range from a modest 10% to a confiscatory 80% . <P> This talent-export system relies on the Communist authorities ' monopoly over sport and culture . In the East bloc , the state controls all sports teams , sponsors philharmonic orchestras and dance troupes and even runs discos , cabarets and jazz clubs . By law , all foreign contracts must be funneled through official talent agencies , which act as impresarios cum exporters . Most of the bloc countries have two agencies , one that deals with sports and another that handles all other specialties . The agencies scout the domestic talent , promote their performers abroad , take bids from Western concerns and negotiate contracts .
