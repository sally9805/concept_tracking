For the third time in 17 months , a major U.S. target in Beirut is bombed <P> It was an act of terrorism that U.S. diplomats had discussed , dreaded and planned against for nearly a year and a half . Yet when it occurred , all the worry , the precautions and the special security devices proved to be almost futile against the fanatical determination of one man to reach his target . " At first I thought it was a supersonic boom , " said a Lebanese civilian moments after the explosion . " Then I knew it was the American embassy . " <P> At 11:45 a.m. last Thursday , a van with diplomatic license plates pulled up at a checkpoint outside the embassy annex , a building in East Beirut that in the past few months had become the headquarters of Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew and his staff . The car was ordered to halt by the Lebanese security guards on duty at the checkpoint . Suddenly the driver pulled a gun and shot at one of the guards . Then , as another guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his engine , zigzagged through the " dragon 's teeth , " a staggered row of concrete blocks designed to reduce the speed of approaching cars , and headed for the embassy building . <P> One of the bodyguards accompanying British Ambassador David Miers , who happened to be visiting his U.S. counterpart , opened fire on the approaching van . Said the British security man later : " I fired about five rounds through the door of the vehicle . I saw the driver fall over . As he fell , he pulled on the wheel and the car swung to the right , hitting a parked vehicle . " The van was still 30 ft. from the embassy when it exploded , producing a flash and a deafening roar . The faade of the building collapsed , raining masonry and broken glass over a wide area in the residential district . <P> The shots fired at the van apparently prevented the driver from reaching his presumed destination , the parking garage underneath the embassy . If the car and its 350 lbs . of explosives had blown up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences . As it was , at least twelve people were killed and 35 wounded , although the casualty figures may turn out to be higher . Among the dead were two Americans attached to the embassy 's military liaison office : Army Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth V. Welch of Grand Rapids , Mich. , and Navy Petty Officer First Class Michael Ray Wagner of Zebulon , N.C. The other fatalities were Lebanese civilians working at the embassy or seeking visas to the U.S. <P> By the ugly standards of Lebanon 's recent history , the toll was not all that high . Just 17 months earlier , 63 people had been killed in the car bombing of the old U.S. embassy in West Beirut . Six months later , similar suicide bombings within moments of each other took the lives of 241 U.S. servicemen and 58 French paratroopers . Sixty-one others died two weeks after that when a bomb devastated an Israeli military headquarters in the southern port city of Tyre . In the meantime , of course , untold hundreds have died in the continuing chaos throughout Lebanon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
