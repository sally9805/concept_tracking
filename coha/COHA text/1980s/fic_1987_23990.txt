S T R Y SNARES By Louise Erdrich It began after church with Margaret and her small granddaughter , Lulu , and was not to end until the long days of Lent and a hard-packed snow . There were factions on the reservation , a treaty settlement in the Agent 's hands . There were Chippewa who signed their names in the year 1924 , and there were Chippewa who saw the cash offered as a flimsy bait . I was one and Fleur Pillager , Lulu 's mother , was another who would not lift her hand to sign . It was said that all the power to witch , harm , or cure lay in Fleur , the lone survivor of the old Pillager clan . But as much as people feared Fleur , they listened to Margaret Kashpaw . She was the ringleader of the holdouts , a fierce , one-minded widow with a vinegar tongue . Margaret Kashpaw had knots of muscles in her arms . Her braids were thin , gray as iron , and usually tied strictly behind her back so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below and tough as roots on top . Her face was gnarled around a beautiful sharp nose . Two shell earrings caught the light and flashed whenever she turned her head . She had become increasingly religious in the years after her loss , and finally succeeded in dragging me to the Benediction Mass , where I was greeted by Father Damien , from whom I occasionally won small sums at dice . " Grandfather Nanapush , " he smiled , " at last . " " These benches are a hardship for an old man , " I complained . " If you spread them with soft pine-needle cushions I 'd have come before . " Louise Erdrich 's most recent novel is The Beet Queen , published by Henry Holt . Father Damien stared thoughtfully at the rough pews , folded his hands inside the sleeves of his robe . " You must think of their unyielding surfaces as helpful , " he offered . " God sometimes enters the soul through the humblest parts of our anatomies , if they are sensitized to suffering . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countered , " is rio better than a thief . " Father Damien was used to me , and smiled as he walked to the altar . I adjusted my old bones , longing for some relief , trying not to rustle for fear of Margaret 's jabbing elbow . The time was long . Lulu probed all my pockets with her fingers until she found a piece of hard candy . I felt no great presence in this cold place and decided , as my back end ached and my shoulders stiffened , that our original gods were better , the Chippewa characters who were not exactly per fect but at least did not require sitting on hard boards . When mass was over and the smell of incense was thick in all our clothes , Margaret , Lulu , and I went out into the starry cold , the snow and stubble fields , and began the long walk to our homes . it was dusk . On either side of us the heavy trees stood motionless and blue . Our footsteps squeaked against the dry snow , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even Lulu ceased her singing when the moon rose to half , poised like a balanced cup . We knew the very moment someone else stepped upon the road . We had turned a bend and the footfalls came unevenly , just out of sight . There were two men , one mixed-blood or white , from the drop of his hard boot soles , and the other one quiet , an Indian . Not long and I heard them talking close behind us . From the rough , quick tension of the Indian 's language , I recognized Lazarre . And the mixed-blood must be Clarence Morrissey . The two had signed the treaty and spoke in its favor to anyone they could collar at the store . They even came to people 's houses to beg and argue that this was our one chance , our good chance , that the government would withdraw the offer . But wherever Margaret was , she slapped down their words like mosquitoes and said the only thing that lasts life to life is land . Money bums like tinder , flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is steadier . It is no wonder that , because she spoke so well , Lazarre and Clarence Morrissey wished to silence her . I sensed their bad intent as they passed us , an unpleasant edge of excitement in their looks and greetings . They went on , disappeared in the dark brush . " Margaret , " I said , " we are going to cut back . " My house was close , but Margaret kept walking forward as if she had n't heard . I took her arm , caught the little girl close , and started to turn us , but Margaret would have none of this and called me a coward . She grabbed the girl to her . Lulu , who did not mind getting tossed between us , laughed , tucked her hand into her grandma 's pocket , and never missed a step . Two years ago she had tired of being carried , got up , walked . She had the balance of a little mink . She was slippery and clever , too , which was good because when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us half a mile on , Lulu slipped free and scrambled into the trees . hey were occupied with Margaret and me , I 'm a talker , a fast-mouth who ca n't keep his thoughts straight , but lets fly with words and marvels at what he hears from his own mouth . I 'm a smart one . I always was a devil for convincing women . And I was n't too bad a shot , in other ways , at convincing men . But I had never been tied up before . " Booshoo , " I said . " Children , let us loose , your game is too rough ! " They stood between us , puffed with their secrets . " Empty old windbag , " said Clarence . " I have a bargain for you , " I said , looking for an opening . " Let us go and we wo n't tell Pukwan . " Edgar Pukwan was the tribal police . " Boys get drunk sometimes and do n't know what they 're doing . " Lazarre laughed once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Just wanting what 's coming to us , some justice , money out of it . " " Kill us , " said Margaret . " We wo n't sign . " " Wait , " I said . " My cousin Pukwan will find you boys , and have no mercy . Let us go . I 'll sign and get it over with , and I 'll persuade the old widow . " I signaled Margaret to keep her mouth shut . She blew air into her cheeks . Clarence looked expectantly at Lazarre , as if the show were over , but Lazarre folded his arms and was convinced of nothing . " You lie when it suits , skinny old dog , " he said , wiping at his lips as if in hunger . " It 's her we want , anyway . We 'll shame her so she shuts her mouth . " " Easy enough , " I said , smooth , " now that you 've got her tied . She 's plump and good-looking . Eyes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost man and wife . " This was n't true at all , and Margaret 's face went rigid with tumbling fury and confusion . 1 kept talking . " So of course if you do what you 're thinking of doing you 'll have to kill me afterward , and that will make my cousin Pukwan twice as angry since I owe him a fat payment for a gun which he lent me and I never returned . All the same , " I went on  --  their heads were spinning  --  Ill forget you bad boys ever considered such a crime , something so terrible that Father Damien would nail you on boards just like in the example on the wall in church . " " Quit jabbering , " Lazarre stopped me in a deadly voice . It was throwing pebbles in a dry lake . My words left no ripple . I saw in his eyes that he intended us great harm . I saw his greed . It was like watching an ugly design of bruises come clear for a moment and reconstructing the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whatever you do to Margaret you are doing to the Pillager woman ! " l dropped my voice . " The witch , Fleur Pillager , is her own son 's wife . " Clarence was too young to be frightened , but his mouth hung in interested puzzlement . My words had a different effect on Lazarre , as a sudden light shone , a consequence he had n't considered . I cried out , seeing this , " Do n't you know she can think about you hard enough to stop your heart ? " Lazarre was still deciding . He raised his fist and swung it casually and tapped my face . It was worse not to be hit full on . " Come near ! " crooned Margaret in the old language . " Let me teach you how to die . " But she was trapped like a fox . Her earrings glinted and spun as she hissed her death song over and over , which signaled something to Lazarre , for he shook himself angrily and drew a razor from his jacket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang shriller , so full of hate that the ropes should have burned , shriveled , fallen from her body . My struggle set the manger cracking against the barn walls and further confused the cows , who bumped each other and complained . At a sign from Lazarre , Clarence sighed , rose , and smashed me . The last I saw before I blacked out , through the tiny closing pinhole of light , was Lazarre approaching Margaret with the blade . When I woke , minutes later , it was to worse shock . For Lazarre had sliced Margaret 's long braids off and was now , carefully , shaving her scalp . He started almost tenderly at the wide part , and then pulled the edge down each side of her skull . He did a clean job . He shed not one drop of her blood . And I could not even speak to curse them . For pressing my jaw down , thick above my tongue , her braids , never cut in this life till now , were tied to silence me . Powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or else it was forever , that we walked out into the night again . Speechless , we made our way in fierce pain down the road . 1 was damaged in spirit , more so than Margaret . For now she tucked her shawl over her naked head and forgot her own bad treatment . She called out in dread each foot of the way , for Lulu . But the smart , bold girl had hidden till all was clear and then run to Margaret 's house . We opened the door and found her sitting by the stove in a litter of scorched matches and kindling . She had not the skill to start a fire , but she was dry-eyed . Though very cold , she was alert and then captured with wonder when Margaret slipped off her shawl . " Where is your hair ? " she asked . I took my hand from my pocket . " Here 's what 's left of it . I grabbed this when they cut me loose . " I was shamed by how pitiful I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and coiled them round her fist . " I knew you would save them , clever man ! " There was satisfaction in her voice . I set the fire blazing . It was strange how generous this woman was to me , never blaming me or mentioning my failure . Margaret stowed her braids inside a birchhark box and merely instructed me to lay it in her grave , when that time occurred . Then she came near the stove with a broken mirror from beside her washstand and looked at her own image . " My , " she pondered , " my . " She put the mirror down . " I 'll take a knife to them . " And I was thinking too . I was thinking I would have to kill them . But how does an aching and half-starved grandfather attack a young , well-fed Morrissey and a tall , sly Lazarre ? Later , I rolled up in blankets in the corner by Margaret 's stove , and I put my mind to this question throughout that night until , exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , too , and still nothing came . It was only after we had some hot gaulette and walked Lulu back to her mother that an idea began to grow . Fleur let us in , hugged Lulu into her arms , and looked at Margaret , who took off her scarf and stood bald , face burning again with smoldered fire . She told Fleur all of what happened , sparing no detail . The two women 's eyes held , but Fleur said nothing . She put Lulu down , smoothed the front of her calico shirt , flipped her heavy braids over her shoulders , tapped one finger on her perfect lips . And then , calm , she went to the washstand and scraped the edge of her hunting knife keen as glass . Margaret and Lulu and I watched as Fleur cut her braids off , shaved her own head , and folded the hair into a quilled skin pouch . Then she went out , hunting , and did n't bother to wait for night to cover her tracks . I would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but anyway that was a white man 's revenge . I knew how to wound with barbs of words , but had never wielded a skinning knife against a human , much less two young men . Whomever I missed would kill me , and I did not want to die by their lowly hands . In fact , I did n't think that after Margaret 's interesting kindness I wanted to leave this life at all . Her head , smooth as an egg , was ridged delicately with bone , and gleamed as if it had been buffed with a flannel cloth . Maybe it was the strangeness that attracted me . She looked forbidding , but the absence of hair also set off her eyes , so black and full of lights . She reminded me of that queen from England , of a water snake or a shrewd young bird . The earrings , which seemed part of her , mirrored her moods like water , and when they were still rounds of green lights against her throat 1 seemed , again , to taste her smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to do than fight . So I decided to accomplish revenge as quickly as possible . I was a talker who used my brains as my weapon . When I hunted , I preferred to let my game catch itself . Linares demand clever fingers and a scheming mind , and snares had never failed me . Snares are quiet , and best of all snares are slow . I wanted to give Lazarre and Morrissey time to consider why they had to strangle . I thought hard . cerned with punishing Lazarre and Clarence Morrissey . Fleur was seen in town . Her thick skirts brushed the snow into clouds behind her . Though it was cold she left her head bare so everyone could see the frigid sun glare off her skull . The light reflected in the eyes of Lazarre and Clarence , who were standing at the door of the pool halt . They dropped their cue sticks in the slush and ran back to Morrissey land . Fleur walked the four streets , once in each direction , then followed . The two men told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house touching here , touching there , sprinkling powders that ignited and stank on the hot stove . How Clarence swayed on his feet , blinked hard , and chewed his fingers . How Fleur stepped up to him , drew her knife . He smiled foolishly and asked her for supper . She reached forward and trimmed off a hank of his hair . Then she stalked from the house , leaving a taste of cold wind , and then chased Lazarre to the barn . She made a black silhouette against the light from the door . Lazarre pressed against the wood of the walls , watching , hypnotized by the sight of Fleur 's head and the quiet blade . He did not defend himself when she approached , reached for him , gently and efficiently cut bits of his hair , held his hands , one at a time , and trimmed the nails . She waved the razor-edged knife before his eyes and swept a few eyelashes into a white square of flour sacking that she then carefully folded into her blouse . For days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by use of had medicine , he said . He showed his hand , the bite that Margaret had dealt him , and the dark streak from the wound , along his wrist and inching up his arm . He even used that bound hand to scratch his name from the treaty , but it did no good . I figured that the two men were doomed at least three ways now . Margaret won the debate with her Catholic training and decided to damn her soul by taking up the ax , since no one else had destroyed her enemies . I begged her to wait for another week , all during which it snowed and thawed and snowed again . It took me that long to arrange the snare to my satisfaction , near Lazarre 's shack , on a path both men took to town . I set it out one morning before anyone stirred , and watched from an old pine twisted along the ground . I waited while the smoke rose in a silky feather from the tiny tin spout on Lazarre 's roof . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even then it was just for wood , nowhere near the path . I had a hard time to keep my blood flowing , my stomach still . I ate a handful of dry berries Margaret had given me , and a bit of pounded meat . I doled it to myself and waited until finally Clarence showed . He walked the trail like a blind ghost and stepped straight into my noose . It was perfect , or would have been if I had made the deadfall two inches wider , for in falling Clarence somehow managed to spread his legs and straddle the deep hole I 'd cut . It had been invisible , covered with snow , and yet in one foot-peddling instant , the certain knowledge of its construction sprang into Clarence 's brain and told his legs to reach for the sides . I do n't know how he did it , but there he was poised . I waited , did not show myself . The noose jerked enough to cut slightly into the fool 's neck , a too-snug fit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he twitched a finger , lost the least control , even tried to yell , one foot would go , the noose constrict . But Clarence did not move . I could see from behind my branches that he did n't even dare to change the expression on his face . His mouth stayed frozen in shock . Only his eyes shifted , darted fiercely and wildly , side to side , showing all the agitation he must not release , searching desperately for a means of escape . They focused only when I finally stepped toward him , quiet , from the pine . We were in full view of Lazarre 's house , face to face . I stood before the boy . Just a touch , a sudden kick , perhaps no more than a word , was all that it would take . But I looked into his eyes and saw the knowledge of his situation . Pity entered me . Even for Margaret 's shame , I could n't do the thing I might have done . I turned away and left Morrissey still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped the same . " It sets off my doe eyes , " Margaret said and stared me down . She wore it every day , and always to mass . Not long before Lent and voices could be heard : " There goes Old Lady Coalbucket . " Nonetheless , she was proud , and softening day by day , could tell . By the time we got our foreheads crossed with ashes , she consented to be married . " I hear you 're thinking of exchanging the vows , " said Father Damien as I shook his hand on our way out the door . " I 'm having relations with Margaret already , " I told him , " that 's the way we do things . " This had happened to him before , so he was not even stumped as to what remedy he should use . " Make a confession , at any rate , " he said , motioning us hack into the church . So I stepped into the little box and knelt . Father Damien slid aside the shadowy door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he stopped me partway through . " No more details . Pray to Our Lady . " " There is one more thing . " " Yes ? " " Clarence Morrissey , he wears a scarf to church around his neck each week . I snared him like a rabbit . " Father Damien let the silence fill him . " And the last thing , " I went on . " I stole the wire from your piano . " The silence spilled over into my stall , and I was held in its grip until the priest spoke . " Discord is hateful to God . You have offended his ear . " Almost as an afterthought , Damien added , " And his commandment . The violence among you must cease . " " You can have the wire back , " I said . I had used only one long strand . I also agreed that I would never use my snares on humans , an easy promise . Lazarre was already caught . Just two days later , while Margaret and I   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
