All right kids , you 're excused . Why do n't you run and see if Steven Spielberg can come out and play ? Or maybe little Arnie Schwarzenegger ? Target is a dream of glory strictly for grownups . <P> You remember grownups , do n't you ? Used to see them in the movies all the time . And they can still be found occasionally in real life . They are the ones who work in dumb places like the lumberyard , always remember to buckle their seat belts and regard an afternoon fishing at the lake as entertainment every bit the equal of Miami Vice . They are also , of course , the ones you ca n't imagine having sex , an interesting past or competence in any field of endeavor that is remotely amusing , let alone thrilling . <P> In short , a grownup is a creature very much resembling Walter Lloyd ( Gene Hackman ) , whose patient efforts to gain the respect of his son Chris ( Matt Dillon ) elicit nothing more than a succession of shrugs and silences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lad who wants to be a race-car driver ? <P> More than anyone might suspect , as it turns out , when Mrs. Lloyd ( Gayle Hunnicutt ) , vacationing in Europe , is abducted , and father and son set out to rescue her . For Walter once led a secret life as a CIA agent , and the kidnaping of his wife is an act of belated ( and misdirected ) revenge for an operation that cost the lives of a Communist master-spy 's family two decades earlier . The Lloyds have not reclaimed their luggage at the Paris airport before Walter is forced to dispatch a thug sent to murder him . In a matter of hours he is giving Junior , who has the innocent courage , clumsiness and distractibility of a puppy , a much needed basic course in espionage field operations . It is clear that being a spy is rather like riding a bicycle : once you have learned how , you never forget . <P> Watching Walter Lloyd conduct a high-speed car chase or evade pursuers by diving off a bridge into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a gentleman of a certain age , roughly equivalent to watching Phil Niekro win his 300th game . It extends the effective life of one 's youthful fantasies a few minutes more . But while stimulating that harmless activity , Target also encourages a modest re-examination of the ideological scaffolding on which the older generation erected some of its dreamwork . <P> Inevitably , Walter 's return to the scenes of old cold war crimes evokes the mood and manner of ' 60s pop spy epics like , say , The Ipcress File . But Director Penn , whose most successful works in that period were counterculture icons like Bonnie and Clyde and Little Big Man , is not about to be nostalgic about his former competition . Target is a deadpan satire on the old cloak-and-dagger conventions almost to the end , at which point Penn can not resist staging with self-conscious luridness a scene in which Walter must deal with a particularly sadistic bomb threat . <P> One might wish that Penn and the writers had avoided the reigning contemporary clich of their genre , which insists on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanitarians . It is an irony that has grown tiresome with overuse . <P> But Hackman 's work is subtly alive to all the complexities of his character and his situation , and his path is strewn with good supporting actors . One can not help offering a chortling cheer to a movie that throws demographic caution to the wind in order to celebrate geezer power .  --  By Richard Schickel
