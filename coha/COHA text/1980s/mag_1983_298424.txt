ITA 's Parkhurst packs it in <P> <P> When Michael Parkhurst , president of the 30,000-member Independent Truckers Association ( ITA ) , announced a truckers strike two weeks ago , his goals were ambitious : repeal of new federal taxes on diesel fuel and highway use , a curb on state trucking taxes and regulations , and a " meaningful discussion " of the 55-m.p.h. speed limit . What he got eleven days later was a page-long " Expression of Concern " signed by some 35 Congressmen that promised little more than a review of the federal tax hikes called for in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 , enacted by last year 's lameduck Congress . Nonetheless , when he asked truckers to return to work last week , Parkhurst appeared unbowed . " We have accomplished a lot , more than we have ever been able to in the past , " he declared at a raucous news conference punctuated by shouts of " Sellout ! " from heckling truckers . <P> In reality , the strike had fizzled out . Despite spot shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markedly disrupt commerce . " I do n't think anyone missed a loaf of bread , an orange or an apple , " said Ed Bacon , president of Louisiana 's Motor Transportation Association . Concluded Massachusetts Produce Wholesaler Chris Rodes : " It was a very minor inconvenience . " The violence and vandalism that in the end left one person dead and at least 66 others injured dropped sharply last week , and truck traffic levels crept back to normal in most states . By week 's end police had arrested 95 people in connection with the incidents , some of them truckers or related to the trucking industry . <P> Many operators and their representatives were glad it was over . Said Paul Stalknecht , managing director of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association : " The only plus is that immediate attention has been drawn to the industry 's problems . But that is a very minor plus . The image of the industry has been damaged because of the irresponsible actions of a very small body . " Indeed , the protest may have set back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Trucking Associations and other trucking organizations that opposed the strike . " This shutdown has only given truckers a black eye with the public , " fumed Robert Jasmon , executive vice president of the Midwest Truckers Association , another independent group . " The real representatives of our industry must talk sense to Congress and get passed the kind of relief we need . "
