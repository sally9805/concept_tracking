Toy &; Hobby World magazine recently reported that Coleco Industries ' cuddly doll ( $59.95 ) lost its position as the best-selling toy in the U.S. , a title it had held for 16 months . The new No. 1 is Hasbro Bradley 's plastic-and-metal toy robot series , the Transformers ( average price : $12 ) . <P> Competition in the toy business is far from childlike .

Hasbro Bradley estimates that it will sell 30 million robots this year , for total sales of $200 million . <P> Coleco disputes the trade magazine 's findings , which were based on a telephone survey of 50 toy sellers . It claims still to be No. 1 . But even if sales momentum has slowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . Toy stores currently stock Coleco 's Cabbage Patch doll pets ( ' Koosas ) and infant dolls ( Preemies ) .
