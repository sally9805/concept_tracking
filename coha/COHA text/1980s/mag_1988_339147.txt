After supporting Panama 's General Manuel Noriega for nearly five years , the Reagan Administration turned against him last February , when the swaggering strongman was indicted on drug-smuggling charges by two Florida grand juries . Since then Washington has tried and failed to force Noriega out with economic sanctions and to shift power to a civilian government headed by ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle . Now , it seems , the State Department is focusing on a different man and a different strategy . The man : Lieut . Colonel Eduardo Herrera Hassan , a 20-year veteran of the Panamanian Defense Forces and a former Ambassador to Israel . The strategy : to encourage a coup within the Panamanian military . <P> While U.S. officials deny that Herrera is getting direct American help , they praise him as a bright and honest soldier who is committed to a professional rather than a political military force . A senior Administration official says with approval , " Noriega considers him a threat . " <P> Herrera , 46 , who is rumored to be either in Costa Rica or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clandestine radio appeals and fax messages to invite senior military officers to join him in a coup . These colonels are thought to be opposed to Noriega 's acceptance of Cuban advisers and weapons , as well as $20 million in Libyan aid . Many enlisted men , unhappy about poor pay and the corruption above them , are also receptive . <P> Yet Herrera faces serious obstacles . For one thing , Noriega is well aware of his rival 's moves , and has dismissed him from the military . Noriega has already stifled one overt coup attempt and nipped other plans . He and seven loyalists known as the " Magnificent Seven " constitute a ruthless faction eager to continue profiting from drugs and corruption . <P> Herrera 's image in Panama is another handicap . A nephew of the late Panamanian Dictator Omar Torrijos , he led military crackdowns against civilian protesters in the former Canal Zone in the 1960s . Called home from Israel by Noriega last year to help repress demonstrations , he did so with what some considered an overly strong hand . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politics while a democratic government emerged , that would more than satisfy U.S. interests . It might also be something of a miracle .
