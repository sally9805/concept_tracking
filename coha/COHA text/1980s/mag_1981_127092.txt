Although marbles has never been a major American sport , there are certain areas of the country that have become renowned for producing marble shooters of great skill . Sebastian County , Ark. is one of them , and when I was growing up in the ' 50s , the greatest shooter in Sebastian County was Bud Needham . I recall with barely diminished trepidation the day I faced him in a game of doogies ( pronounced DOO-jees ) , as we often called marbles. // I tried to appear relaxed as Bud arched his hand slightly off the ground , took dead aim with his shootin ' tall and fired a sizzling shot into the ring . He hit three of my cat's-eyes . The sound was crisp and solid and marbles flew in every direction . Two rolled outside the ring . He picked them up , and while he stuffed them in his bulging jeans pocket , he eyed the next shot . // His shootin ' tall had remained inside the ring , and therefore he was entitled to another shot , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . J knew it was all over . Bud could shoot a doogie like a .22 rifle bullet and just as straight . // This confrontation took place back in 1956 , in the first round of the sixth-grade marble tournament at Greenwood Elementary School . I 'd had the misfortune of drawing Bud , the toughest kid in school and the only one I knew with hair on his chest . He had four brothers , and they were all just as rugged as Bud . They were from an honest , hard-working , coal-mining family , and my mama had taught three of them in the fifth grade and could vouch for their toughness . She also knew that Bud could shoot a marble like a bullet and that was one reason she did n't want me playing keeps with him . ( Keeps was a more serious game than funnies , in which the marbles were given back after the game . ) Mama did n't want me playing keeps with anyone . She was a staunch Southern Baptist and did n't like the idea of my playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I said , " Mom , playing keeps with Bud Needham ai n't a game of chance because I ai n't got one . " // Mama said , " Do n't say ai n't and do n't play keeps with anyone , but especially Bud Needham. " // Now if you think I might be exaggerating about Bud 's being ahead of the rest of us physically , here are some additional facts to consider : In the sixth grade he started shaving twice a week . In the seventh grade he made first string on the junior high football team by putting the fear into ninth-grade halfbacks . In his sophomore year in high school he made first-string guard and was , perhaps , the only player in the history of Greenwood High to play every down of every game for three straight years . // My father , who coached the Greenwood Bulldogs for 38 years , said upon retirement , " Bud Needham was probably the toughest kid I ever had , " which was saying something , because Dad had coached farm boys , hillbillies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ozarks . ( He saw some tough kids along the way , like the Powell boy who practiced football for two weeks before it was discovered he was n't wearing socks in his hightop shoes because he did n't own any. ) // So you see , Bud was special . When he played marbles he would place the shootin ' tall between his right thumb and index finger and roll his wrist to the right like he was turning a doorknob . Then , with his hand palm up and the three free fingers pointing upward , he would close one eye . There would be a brief vibration in his hand , and ... PING ! The shootin ' tall would spring across the ring scattering little specks of dirt and grass and smash into its target , knocking that marble out of the ring . // On more than one occasion Bud shot so hard the target marble exploded on impact . I swear on a sack of cat's-eyes . He would look at it with disgust , secretly proud of busting another one , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Bud busted another one ! " // My inferior ability as a marbles player was embarrassing . I hate to admit it to this day , but I shot like a girl . I could n't seem to put any zing into my shootin ' tall . I watched Bud intently , trying to figure out his secret . But no matter what technique I tried , my marble would roll lazily across the dirt ring , being bumped farther off course by every bit of gravel and twig it encountered . If by chance my shootin ' tall hit the target marble , the marble usually stayed in the ring . // Doogie shooting was one of those things a kid wanted to do well in Arkansas . It was right up there with hauling hay , riding a bronco and cussing as a sign of incipient manhood . For a sixth-grade boy whose father was the high school football coach and former doogie-shooting champion of Milltown , Ark. , it was downright shameful not to be able to really pop it . That 's why I finally resorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't play keeps until I discovered aggies and tater nobs . Before that , I told everyone that Mom , being as religious as she was , did n't allow me to play in games of chance , though the truth was I did n't play keeps because I would n't get to keep any . Then I came across an aggie , a big , heavy , agate-type marble about the size of a small golf ball . You could roll it like a bowling ball and knock marbles all over the place . Tater nobs were little mounds of dirt upon which you mounted the target marble . You could n't miss . With the big aggie and tater nobs I started to wipe out the sixth grade . I learned to yell , " Aggies and tater nobs ! " before my opponent could yell , " No aggies and no tater nobs ! " // In this manner I talked Elmer Mac-Donald into playing a game of keeps and won a pocketful of marbles during the 10 o'clock recess . Then at noon I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , " Hey , let 's play some keeps . " Kenny was so shocked at my wanting to play keeps that he Said O.K. without outlawing aggies and tater nobs . I calmly said , " Ten up , and aggies and tater nobs allowed . " // " Oh , come on ! " he said disgustedly. // " I yelled first , " I insisted . I rolled the old aggie like a bowling ball and proceeded to pocket about 25 new cat's-eyes. // That afternoon I walked home with the glorious sound of marbles clacking together in my pockets . They made a huge bulge in my jeans and caused them to sag . I kept pulling up my jeans and stroking those marbles. // " Son , " said Mama when she saw the bulge in my pockets , " where did you get all those marbles ? You have n't been playing keeps , have you ? " // I had to admit that I had . " I won them fair and square , " I said . // After a severe tongue-lashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a week later my dad  --  with much encouragement from my mother , I imagine  --  organized the official sixth-grade tournament and brought out a genuine marbles ' rule book . Just before the big game I was informed by my father that these rules did n't allow for tater nobs , rainbows , elbows and other tactics that were regarded as abominations by marbles purists . But the real killer for me was that no oversized shootin ' tails were allowed . That meant the end of my aggie. // According to the book , the official ring was 10 feet across , two or three times larger than the customary Greenwood ring . I could n't throw one that far , much less shoot it legally . So I secretly rooted for Bud to clean house so I would n't have to shoot in front of the crowd that had gathered . // And , sure enough , after that aforementioned opening shot , Bud settled into his routine and blasted marbles in all directions . He would shoot with such force and accuracy that his shootin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the dirt , while the shootin ' tall spun in place , making a funny noise as it came to a stop . Thus , as a group of boys and a few girls looked on , did Bud Needham clear the ring . // " Aw shucks , " I said , secretly relieved that I would n't have to attempt a shot across the 10-foot ring . Naturally , Bud won the tournament , and I later discovered that I was n't alone in my fear of his bulletlike shots . // After that , marbles playing quietly disappeared from the scene . The guys in our class moved on to football , basketball , hot rods and girls . I have n't played doogies in a long , long time , but if I ever get the opportunity again , I shall certainly insist on aggies and tater nobs.
