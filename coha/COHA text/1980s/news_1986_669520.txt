What Mr. Person , a graduate student at the University of Vermont ( UVM ) in nearby Burlington , had hoped to see was a coyote , caught in the padded rubber jaws of one of his traps . That often-maligned predator , famous for its wily ways and eerie howls , is usually thought of as a Westerner , but in recent decades it has staked a firm claim to the Northeast , sparking the curiosity of scholars and local farmers alike. // // Piecing together a picture // Person and fellow researcher Moira Ingle have been making these early morning forays into this rolling pastureland for two years now . Their goal is to capture as many of the canny critters as possible , attach radio transmitters to them before releasing them , and thus try to fathom their habits. // But coyotes have been elusive this spring and early summer . This morning ' s ' ' catch , ' ' after checking dozens of traps , turned out to be one thoroughly miffed farm cat . After some soothing and reassurance the orange tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else , that the specially designed padded traps are indeed relatively gentle with their victims. // Spring and summer are always slow , notes Person , recalling that last fall they once caught five coyotes in a day . ' ' It all averages out , ' ' he concludes. // Bit by bit , the two researchers are piecing together a clearer picture of the animals ' social structures - territorial instincts , stability of male-female pairings , dispersal of the young . They ' ve found that coyote society has a few mavericks who live a solitary life without mating or carving out a territory of their own . And they ' ve had young animals that have set off in search of unclaimed land turn up 60 miles or more away , which would seem to indicate that the immediate Champlain Valley area is pretty densely populated , by coyote standards . <> <> A formidable predator // The UVM researchers have developed a strong respect for their bushy-tailed subjects . While keeping an eye peeled for his well-hidden traps , all of which are located near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the animals are ' ' the most formidable predator in this area now , ' ' succeeding the bobcat , which is smaller , and the long-since-extirpated wolf . ' ' They ' re so adaptable , ' ' he continues . ' ' They have the ability to survive in all kinds of environments. ' ' // ' ' They just thrive , ' ' adds Ms. Ingle . Her main interest in the study is the gray and red foxes that sometimes find their way into one of Person ' s traps . They are native predators that apparently coexist uneasily with the coyotes , who have been known to kill their smaller canine cousins . Ingle is intent on understanding the relationship between the two fox species and the coyote , all of which establish definite territories . Do boundaries // overlap ? Do foxes just roam between coyote ' ' zones ' ' ? // Previous coyote studies have been done in the West and in the Maine forests , but what sets the Vermont project apart is its focus on a heavily farmed region with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UVM professor supervising the study . He ' s very pleased that the Person-Ingle team has been able to capture and tag 27 coyotes so far . That ' s a good-sized sample , he says , and should generate a lot of new data on the creatures . <> <> The fine art of trapping coyotes // Trapping coyotes is no mean trick , by the way . ' ' There ' s at least as much art as there is science to catching them , ' ' says Dr. Hirth . Person explains that they had little success before getting in touch with Bob Hoffman , a local trapper who specializes in coyotes . From Mr. Hoffman , Person learned the intricacies of scenting the traps with the right odors for a particular time of year . A worn-looking wooden box in the back of Person ' s truck carries a collection of little glass bottles with such labels as ' ' Wilely Red ' ' and ' ' Beaver Castors. ' ' // The project is underwritten by the Vermont Department of Fish and Game - which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about these recent emigrants . The coyote ' s migratory ways have taken it through the upper Middle West , into Canada , and down into New England , Hirth explains . The first coyotes were spotted in Vermont back in 1948 . Estimates of the number of coyotes now in the state range from a low of 2 , 000 to as many as 4 , 000. // ' ' In 35 years or so , animals that had never been here before suddenly expanded throughout the state , ' ' Hirth observes . As they migrated , the coyotes apparently picked up some new habits , as well as different physical traits , possibly from interbreeding with some species of wolves in Canada , he explains. // The Vermont variety is roughly 10 pounds heavier than its Western kin , with a much more varied coat color ( from dark gray to lighter shades ) and less of a tendency to utter the familiar howl. // From the information the UVM team has managed to amass , the wild canines have found this part of the country - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place indeed . Food ranges from mice and rabbits to woodchucks , skunks , and even an occasional deer or sheep . The latter fare , of course , is what has given the coyote such a bad name in the West , where they are regularly hunted or poisoned. // Here , farmers usually keep their sheep within small fenced pastures rather than on an open range . That minimizes coyote problems , says Hirth . Still , there have been rare reports of sheep being killed and , less often , young calves being taken. // ' ' It has the potential of being a real problem , ' ' Hirth says . In addition , trappers in the state are concerned about coyotes killing foxes , and hunters worry about the predator ' s impact on deer herds. // ' ' I don ' t think they ' re a menace ' ' to farm animals , says Person . Marauding packs of domestic dogs pose a much greater threat to livestock , in his view . Small wild game is plentiful , Person points out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by dairy farmers . With the thousands of rodents they devour each year , coyotes - and foxes too - are ' ' for the most part doing a lot more good than harm , ' ' says Ingle. // Hirth is of the view that coyotes and Vermonters can probably peacefully coexist . With the coyotes ' renowned adaptability , humans may have little choice in the matter. // //
