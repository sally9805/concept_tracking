Disaster strikes a 10,105-ton floating dormitory <P> " There was a sharp , crackling sound followed by something that sounded like a muffled explosion . " So recalled one of the numbed but fortunate few who were plucked from the icy North Sea last week after the worst oil rig disaster in the history of offshore drilling . Battered by towering 25-ft. waves and 55-knot winds , a mammoth floating dormitory housing 212 oil workers capsized and plunged into the sea , 100 miles west of the Norwegian coast . <P> " There was panic everywhere , " said Gerry Stigen , 36 , a Norwegian oil rig worker who managed to jump into the water and swim to another rig near by , where he was hoisted aboard . " Everything happened so fast , so suddenly . " Emergency flares lit up the nighttime skies as British , German and Norwegian helicopters and a flotilla of ships rushed to the scene . Fighting heavy seas and winds , they struggled to rescue those who had clambered into lifeboats , clung desperately to heaving dinghies or plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end , as the chances of finding more survivors faded , the grim toll stood at 40 dead , 83 missing and presumed dead , and 89 rescued . Said an incredulous Captain Kjetil Hauge , whose crew had been relieved only hours before the catastrophe : " I was horrified and shocked . I had been convinced that something like this could not happen . Not with that rig . " <P> Indeed , the Alexander Kielland appeared to be a marvel of modern marine engineering . Built in 1976 by the Compagnie Franaise d'Entreprises Mtalliques , based in Paris , the pentagonal 10,105-ton platform was leased and operated by Phillips Petroleum Co. , the major contractor for oil and natural gas prospecting in the rich Edda field . For the rotating crews that lived there for two weeks at a time , it was intended to be a floating city-a sort of workingman 's Titanic . And like the Titanic , the Alexander Kielland was theoretically invulnerable . Says Jakob Eri , director of a Norwegian firm specializing in inspecting ships and rigs : " These rigs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are supposed to survive any weather and to be absolutely safe . " <P> Confident in their absolute safety , the predominantly Norwegian crew went about business as usual on the fateful evening , despite the mounting gale winds and violent waves that began to buffet the platform . Some of the men were relaxing in their sleeping quarters , others eating in the mess hall or taking in a movie . At 6:30 p.m. , their floating world collapsed . <P> " The platform suddenly tilted about 45 degrees , and everybody was thrown back against a wall , " said Olav Skotheim , 41 , one of the survivors , who was in the movie theater at the time . " There were about 60 of us in there . We all started scrambling for the exits as the lights went out . " Also in the theater was Briton Tony Silvester , 31 , who described the scene as one of " complete chaos , with oxygen bottles flying all over the place . Nobody knew what to do . Suddenly she toppled over and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . Less fortunate were some 50 others who were believed to have been trapped in the submerged theater.
