" I didn ' t do anything to help anybody until the fourth quarter , " said McHale , who scored 14 points in the final 12 furious minutes and snared several critical rebounds . " It was one of those games where I was in a fog . I wasn ' t moving well in the first half and wasn ' t crisp . " While I was sitting down in the third quarter ( foul trouble ) , I said , ' When I get into the game in the fourth quarter , I ' m going to do what I can to help them win .

" We tried to beat them up the floor , " Collins said about his fourth quarter lineup that didn ' t inlcude a center . " That ' s how we got back into the game . We thought we could get them in a transition game . But we didn ' t get the rebounds . " " Either way , it ' s tough , " McHale said . " Some teams throw the big , bulky guys at us and try to beat us on the boards . Then , we just outrun them . Other times , you try what the Bulls did , a smaller , quicker lineup to outrun us .

" I think Michael gets more of his shots outof a team situation . They are getting Michael freed up in a team concept . They ' ve got a lot of live bodies and Oakley ( Charles Oakley , 20 points , 13 rebounds ) is still getting a lot of rebounds . Doug is doing a nice job . They ' ve got a good team . " " We made key mistakes in the last three minutes , " said Collins , " by not taking our time and hurrying our shots . We also failed to block out and let McHale and Parish control the offensive boards . " Boston waits for you to make one mistake , and they kill you .
