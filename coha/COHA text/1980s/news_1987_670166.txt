U.S. oil prices surged above $21 a barrel on spot and futures markets to their highest level in 1 1/2 years amid heightened military tension in the Persian Gulf . The rally  --  the eighth oil-price gain in the past 10 sessions  --  was sparked by an Iranian gunboat attack on a U.S.-operated supertanker in the gulf . The Peconic , which was set on fire near a Kuwaiti oil terminal , was under contract with Texaco Inc. ' s Texaco Panama Inc. unit to deliver two million barrels of Persian Gulf crude oil to the U.S. , Texaco said . When the Liberian-registered tanker was hit , it was on its way to load 60 , 000 tons of Kuwaiti crude . The Iranian action was " a clear sign of escalation in the gulf " and a " warning to the U.S. from the Iranians to stay out of their territory , " said David Mizrahi , editor of the MidEast Report , a New York-based newsletter . Coupled with concerns about planned U.S. reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf area , the attack triggered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Mercantile Exchange . The oil market " is a political game right now , " said Ian Gibson , vice president at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in New York . The higher spot and futures prices have led several U.S. oil companies to hike the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate , the bellwether domestic crude . And the recent gains have fueled record trading turnover at the New York Merc . Crude for August delivery rose 35 cents a barrel to $21. 23 . The last time prices closed higher was Jan. 20 , 1986 , when they stood at $21. 27 . Heating oil and gasoline futures prices also rose . Spot , or noncontract , prices , posted similar gains .

" If traders see the tensions dying down , prices will drop  --  gradually . " Yet some market specialists contend that strong buying will continue to surface on price dips . " Any pullbacks will be minimal  --  there are too many people willing to buy , " said John O ' Dea , manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York . The rally is being extended by traders who continue to buy futures contracts while hedging their positions in the crude oil options market , Mr. O ' Dea said . In any event , the recent oil-price optimism has sparked a flurry of posted-price increases among oil companies . Yesterday Conoco Inc. , a unit of Du Pont Co . ; Diamond Shamrock R &; M Inc . ; Koch Oil Co . ; Permian Corp . , Phillips Petroleum Co. and Sun Co. , among others , raised the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate 50 cents , to $19. 50 a barrel .

Commodity funds , or pools of professionally managed money , " have become big players in the market , " an analyst said , and some traders are concerned that prices may plunge if the funds decide to take profits simultaneously .

The slaughter is coming to the point where there will be pressure on product prices , said Gerald Abbenhaus , an analyst at A.G. Edwards &; Sons Inc. in St. Louis . Cattle prices were mixed , as the December contract hit a lifetime high . Sluggish beef sales weighed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar-watchers grew disappointed with the U.S. currency ' s inability to rally further .

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Soybeans and wheat futures prices ended higher yesterday , while corn was mixed .

The report , released after the close of trading yesterday , said 66 million acres of corn were planted this spring , rather than the 68 million acres that many analysts predicted . The figure reduces expected corn production about 300 million bushels , said Ted Mao , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York . However , he cautioned , the " modest decline " in supplies at season ' s end " aren ' t enough to warrant a bull market . " The soybean acreage figure was a little higher than expected , at 58. 7 million acres . It means , " we can have lower yields and still get a big crop , " said Mickey Luth , a Shearson analyst in Chicago . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
