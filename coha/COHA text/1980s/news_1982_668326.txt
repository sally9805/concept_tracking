Special to The Globe TSETSE , South Africa - The people of Tsetse have a legacy from the South African government : a set of silver-bright metal outhouses . The outhouses were given to them about four years ago when they were " relocated " in the dry bush of the Western Transvaal , about 200 miles from Johannesburg . Not much else was given to them , for Tsetse is a " resettlement " camp for blacks . The estimated 3500 people who live here are victims of the giant process of people-shuffling that stems from apartheid . They had no choice . They were ordered by the government to move from where they were . They are a sample of the hundreds of thousands who have been , and are being , uprooted . Previously , the people of Tsetse lived about 100 miles to the east , at Doornkop . They had been there for many years , perhaps since late last century . They were small farmers , with pieces of land to plow for corn and on which to graze cattle . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could usually get work in nearby " white " towns . But , unfortunately for Doornkop , it was a " black spot " : black- owned land in the middle of fertile farming ground owned by whites . So the government evicted the blacks . Indeed , the entire area around the western Transvaal towns of Ventersdorp and Lichtenburg was cleared of " black spots , " and there are four other resettlement camps near Tsetse . Altogether , they hold about 15,000 people . There were no known local white protests against the removals . It could hardly have been expected : In Lichtenburg , old racial ways remain . At Doornkop , a few piles of stones are all that remain of what were once the homes of the blacks . A barbed-wire fence runs close to one of the ruins , enclosing plowed land . Cattle graze on other stretches . It is an infinitely more benign and hospitable area than Tsetse . Since the people from the Doornkop area are of the Tswana tribe , they were relocated in Bophuthatswana , one of the tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its drive to partition the country . Bophuthatswana has South African-created independence , but that status goes unrecognized by the world outside South Africa . Tsetse itself lies on a flat piece of land between two small hills . It is reached by a dirt road that branches off another dirt road , which in turn branches off the paved highway that runs from Johannesburg to the border with Botswana . Although Tsetse is only about 12 miles from the town of Mafeking - famedbecause the British general Lord Baden-Powell held it against an Afrikaner Boer siege 80 years ago - it is largely isolated from the world . When the black people were first taken to Tsetse , the South African government gave them the outhouses as well as huts made from the same galvanized iron . Many of the huts were removed after six months , the people say , but hundreds of outhouses remain . The outhouses perform a practical function , but they are also symbolic of the plight of the people there ; The structures are unstable and tend to fall on their sides when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African government has left behind outdoor taps for water . There are about 750 houses , but a far smaller number of taps . The water supply often dries up late in the afternoon , and sometimes fails entirely for one or two days . The water is pumped from elsewhere to a concrete reservoir : A while ago the cover was blown off by a high wind and remained unrepaired for about two months . There is not a single telephone , nor is there electricity . For cooking - and heating on cold winter nights - people go foraging , searching for cattle dung or making what use they can of the scraggly bush . They live in crude houses , the more substantial ones made from mud bricks , or otherwise from battered sheets of corrugated iron . There is one other gift from South Africa : brick buildings for the primary-level school on top of one of the hills . But there is an acute shortage of furniture and three to five children cram into desks meant for two , or sit on plain benches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1108 children in the school , so nine of the 19 classrooms remain in the original metal huts erected when the people were first brought there . The huts stand on the bare ground . The 20 teachers also live in metal huts . The principal is an elderly bachelor , Johannes Rabaji . His office is a small metal hut , as is his adjoining home . He is a gentle , quiet-spoken man and he speaks without bitterness as he sits in his steamy-hot office : " I keep in this shanty all day . At the end of the day , I go to another shanty to rest . " Another hut , also measuring about 11 feet by 11 feet , is home for three women teachers . One of them has a baby with her . The huts are fiendishly hot in summer and freezingly cold in winter . On a broiling summer ' s day , the inside bare metal wall can not be touched . Several of the roofs are bent : They get blown off by the wind . In these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living : a kitchen-dresser or a plastic-topped table and chairs , or sitting incongruously on a wall-strut , a row of colorfully packaged consumer items - deodorant , toothpaste , hair oil , perfume . Grim and dreary as the lives of the teachers are , at least they have jobs . Many of the Tsetse people do not . There is little work to be had in the district , so the men go far afield to find work , using the few buses that come by each day , or returning only over weekends . The women , children and old people stay at home . As with most information concerning relocation , statistics are often guesses . But it is thought that there is 80-percent unemployment at Tsetse . Certainly the health conditions bear out the rudimentary standard of living and lack of food . Doctors who see some of the people at a clinic 4 miles away that serves all the camps say 60 to 70 percent of those they examine have chest pathology , mainly tuberculosis . One doctor says there is " a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the poor living conditions , this results in a great deal of infectious skin diseases . At the primary school , teachers say that most mornings children faint during assembly as a result of lack of food . About the old people , a doctor says : " They can ' t get to Mafeking - the return bus trip costs $1.20 - and they can ' t get to the clinic . They just die . " The dying causes problems for the living : People say that when they have to prepare a grave , they start in the mid- afternoon , when it is cooler , and take turns through the night digging the hard , flinty ground . Sometimes they are still digging when it ' s time for the burial the next morning . Not , in any event , that many of the living have much energy for anything . A torpor hangs over Tsetse . Speak to people , ask them how they like being there , or whether they would prefer to be somewhere else , and the invariable answer is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The spirit , or lack of it , is conveyed by the name of the village - Tsetse , of course , is the fly that carries sleeping sickness , widespread in Africa . It is not clear how the name came to be used here , because whatever else is wrong about Tsetse , there is no trace of the disease . With its 1108 children , the primary school is packed . Even then , it is estimated that another 200 to 400 children are not at the school because parents say they can not afford the $3-a-year fee . Despite this , there has been a community effort to help build a middle school . The South African government contributed three classrooms and the people of Tsetse are paying for another three . Families have given about $20 each toward the cost . Those who have not had the money have pulled their children out of school and sent them to work until the cash was raised . The walls are standing , but the money has run out for the corrugated iron for the roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular problem of Tsetse and its neighboring camps is that while they are situated on land transferred to Bophuthatswana , the administration of the area has not yet been handed over and remains in South African hands . So , the people of Tsetse are in a sort of no man ' s land . They are an abandoned people . The only ones who have taken an active interest in them are a handful of Mafeking people - a priest , a teacher and a doctor - and officials of the South African Institute of Race Relations in Johannesburg . The institute wants to help the people of Tsetse through the " Operation Hunger " program it runs to provide food for the starving in black rural areas . But plans to send in soup powders and protein-rich biscuits have had to be delayed because of Tsetse ' s uncertain water supply . Bophuthatswana ' s Minister of Health , Dr. Patrick Mokhobo , acknowledges the problems . " The people belong to nobody , so there ' s been no progress , " he says . He speaks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clinic , or at least a health station . Meanwhile , he says that when he has visited Tsetse he has noticed those high , narrow outhouses . " They remind me of tombstones , " he says . B07846020
