And that is just the beginning . The consensus among some of the world ' s leading wheat and rice experts , just back from China , including 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman E. Borlaug , is that the Chinese are going to increase their wheat , rice , and maize yields 25 to 50 percent in the next 10 years. // According to Dr. Borlaug , interviewed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center here , China probably would have broken the world grain production record this year had not the North China Plain suffered its worst drought in half a century. // " The 1980 wheat harvest is down , " Dr. borlaug said , " but there ' s no serious trouble thanks to tens of thousands of new tube wells . Otherwise it might have been a disaster. " // In 1978-79 , China produced more wheat than the United States , 61 million tons to 58 million , but grew much less than Russia . China is far and away the world ' s champion rice producer with 132 million tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . The United States still produces more maize , 197 million tons to China ' s 57 million , but US farmers feed it to pigs and cows while the Chinese eat it. // Will 4 million mechanized , oil-dependent American farmers mind being outperformed by 315 million muscle- powered Chinese peasants ? // China is begger than the United States ( 2 , 403 million acres to 1 , 897 million ) but is so mountanious and dry its cropped land is only two-thirds that of the US . By cropping more intensively , however , the Chinese sow the equivalent of 387 million acres vs. the US ' s 340 million. // The big reason China is likely to outproduce the United States from now on is chemical fertilizer . US farmers use about five times as much as the Chinese do , yet China ' s yields are still below the world average for wheat , maize , and barely and half of what the Japanese get with rice. // The Chinese , nevertheless , are catching up fast . Until 1960 the country had never used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen 1 , 000-ton-per-day anhydrous ammonia plants and this summer started to double capacity at 1 , 200 small oil- and coal-based fertilizer plants . And China has all the domestic oil and coal it needs . Wheat production rose 50 percent between 1977 and 1979 , from 41 to 61 million tons. // The country ' s success story starts with good soil . Unlike India , which uses dung for cooking fuel , China has been applying organic matter to the earth for centuries . Nothing goes to waste . In 1977 the Chinese applied 1. 7 billion tons of night soil , cattle , sheep , pig , goat , and poultry manure , plant residues , green manure , mud and silt , city garbage , oil seed cakes , ashes , fish and silk waste , and Even bones . Until now , two-thirds of China ' s fertilizer has been organic. // Indeed the 320 million pigs in China today , up from 58 million in 1949 , generate enough fertilizer to produce 30 million tons of grain a year , Dr. Borlaug estimates. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four legs " and urged every Chinese family to raise one or two . ( They pay for most village family TV sets. ) // Since 1949 the Chinese also have invested heavily in irrigation . An estimated 83. 7 million acres are now watered , representing the world ' s largest stretch of irrigated cropland or about twice the 39. 5 million irrigated acres in the US . This allows for widespread multiple cropping and intercropping. // Amazingly , China feeds 24 percent of the world ' s people on 7 percent of its cropland and has managed to increase per capita consumption 50 percent since the revolution . Rice is the staple diet . Gurdev Khush , chief plant breeder at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines , who was in China the same time as this writer in June , told me : " China ' s average rice yield is 4 tons per hectare . With enough chemical fertilizer this could easily be raised to 6 tons . China won ' t have any trouble feeding its people , up to the year 2000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected that China ' s 975 million population would rise to 1. 2 billion by the year 2000 , then level off at 1. 5 billion , about the same 50 percent increase Dr. Khush predicts for rice production . And the bureau noted that its projection for the year 2000 could be on the high side " in light of China ' s recently announced policy to encourage the one-child family. " // What is happening in China is part of the movement begun in the 1960s that applies Western biological science to agriculture . It enabled India to breeze through its worst drought in a century last year , thanks to 22 million tons of grain in stock . In Indonesia this year it has led to predictions of a record 20-million-ton rice crop , creating a glut and embarrassing the Jakarta government . Jakarta officials , expecting much less , had ordered 2. 6 million tons from abroad. // Western scientists find few crops in China today that have not been crossed with dwarf high-yield varieties originally bred in Mexico , the Philippines , Taiwan , Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening its doors to Western farm science is widespread . Since 1974 in wheat and 1976 in rice , China has been exchanging crop germ plasma and the latest farming techniques with the rest of the world . Most experts estimate Mao ' s 27-year rule set back Chinese biology and applied agricultural science a generation. // The apparent buoyancy of Asian agriculture contrasts sharply with recent gloomy forecasts from Washington  --  particularly " The Global 2000 Report to the President " published by the Carter administration in August. // Africa , where food production fell 7 to 8 percent during the 1970s , and parts of Central and South America seem to fit the administration ' s study . But not Asia. // The Global 2000 report has the average Chinese eating 217. 6 kilograms of food in 1973-75 , rising to 259 kilograms by the year 2000 . But in Peking this summer the minimum current per capita consumption figure was 286 kilograms . Some estimates ran as high as 307 kilograms. // //                @ @ @ @ @
