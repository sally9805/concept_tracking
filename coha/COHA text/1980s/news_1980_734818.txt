txt As he takes up his new duties as the junior Senator from Alabama , Adm . Jeremiah Denton wishes to inform the anxious citizenry of the nation 's capital that he never seriously proposed the death penalty for adultery . " The guy who first reported me saying that was drunk or just plain malicious , " says the 56-year-old retired admiral , who spent 7% years in North Vietnamese prison camps , four years of which were in solitary confinement and often in a jail cell the size of a refrigerator . Of all the people being swept into Washington by the Ronald Reagan landslide , none is more unlikely than this one . He comes here as Alabama 's first Republican Senator since Reconstruction , as a loyal friend and confidant of former President Nixon , and as a Bible-quoting Roman Catholic and the father of seven who sometimes cusses like a bosun . He is n't exactly sure why he 's here or how he got here . He is n't sure what will happen to him here . But he 's so excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Sense of Mission He comes here to restore the reputation of Richard Nixon and to rewrite the history of the Vietnam war . He comes ' here to educate the mass media , especially television people , about the " real world . " And he comes here to protect the family from all those things he discovered , to his horror , when he came home ? pornography , massage parlors and , yes , adultery . He is one of a kind . The conservative Mr. Denton 's reputation precedes him to Washington , where it is widely believed that he is a creature of the fundamentalist Moral Majority and that , because he was a career naval officer ( he was in Jimmy Carter 's class at the Naval Academy ) , he will be a shill for the Pentagon . But the admiral may surprise a lot of people . All those years he spent in solitary got him thinking about things , and he brings an unusual outlook to his new job . " I 'm not a naive , moralistic Moral Majority fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) a militaristic nut , either . " He was supported ? ' by the Rev. Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority in Alabama , but he has some se rious questions about that organization , which claims two million members . " I do n't see black people on the board of the Moral Majority , " he says . " I do n't see the Moral Majority supporting the commandment , ' Love thy neighbor . ' " At a briefing by right-wing groups here in Washington the other day , Mr. Denton put that question directly to Mr. Falwell . The fundamentalist preacher from Lynchburg , Va .. conceded that too few blacks were in his organization . He promised that the Moral Majority would try harder to recruit them . " That 's what I have to say to then " Mr. Denton says of the Moral Majority people . " Put up or shut up ! Prove you are Christians ! What 's the essence of Christianity ? It 's love the Lord thy God , love thy neighbor . So I say , prove it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are more interested hi saving the family structure in this camtry than anyone else . Again , prove these Christian schools are n't shelters for segregationists . Prove it ! " Mr. Denton . ' the overwhelming choice of rural whites in Alabama , is n't even sure that the new Congress should move now to put an end to busing as a means of achieving racial Integration . " Holy - ! the blacks would say to et Here these countrydub Republicans go already . " Now hart the time to rend black Americans that kind of message , be says . Mr. Denton had more than seven long years in prison eels to think about these adngs . He remembers nights when his cell turned bright ersage from the filmes ei American 13-52 bombers faJIh boa the sky . He was the first &aim; to get orthe plane when the prisoners dine home in 1973 . Many Americus remember him sayInc " God bless America . " His experience became a made-for-TV movie starring veteran actor Hal Holbrook , a strong critic of the war . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used " In that movie in an effort to:promote the admiral 's political career . Mr : Denton says that when the movie was ' made . he had n't even thought of running for . political office . The admiral reveres ? former President . Nixon for sending those bombers over Hanoi , even when the American public was turning against , the war . " That took courage , " he contends . He insists that the bombing actually won the war , if Americans only had knoin it . " All our captors talked about was whether they would be tried as war crimipals . They knew it was over . The South Vietnamese army could have marched into Hanoi hardly firing a shot , " he maintains . Mr. Nixon contributed $1,000 to Mr. Denton 's campaign , and the two men talk regularly on the telephone . Mr. Denton blames the mass media ? he is obsessed by Walter Cronkite 's role in molding public opinion ? for perSuading Americans that the war could n't be won . " The war , " and the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of force In defense of a vital interest is somehow wrong , " the admiral asserts . " Unless we see the war in Vietnam was just and right , as a nation we simply ca n't go forward . " He says Mr. Nixon understood the use of force . He hopes Gen. Alexander Haig , Mr. Nixon 's chief of staff , will become President-elect Reagan 's Secretary of State because Gen. Haig , too , understands the use of force , Mr. Denton says . But Mr. Nixon 's Secretary , of State , Henry Kissinger , should n't get a high-level job because , Mr. Denton contends , he never understood force . " He thought he could talk the other side around , " Mr. Denton says . Still in the Dark ? The admiral 's initial impression of Washington is that Important people still do n't seem to know what they 're talking about . The other day , one of his staffers says , Mr. Demon attended a private luncheon at which Secretary of State Edmund Muskie explained that the administration believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muskie added that the U.S. was required to send India 400 tons of uranium or else India would abrogate an agreement with the U.S. in which India promises that it wo n't develop a nuclear arsenal . Mr. Denton asked Republican Sen. Charles Percy of Illinois , the likely chairman of the State Foreign Relations Committee , on which Mr. Denton wants to serve , what lie thought of that . Mr. Percy said he fully agreed with Mr. Muskie . Mr. Denton is said to be appalled at the whole business . But he does n't know what to do . " I just do n't know how I 'm going to handle myself in situations like this , " he told his aides . He is obsessed with the fear that the U.S. is n't strong enough to defend itself anymore . All that prevents Russia from launching an all-out nuclear attack , he believes , is the turbulence within the Soviet Union and its satellite powers . By the ** he says , - we will have less national security than we had proportionately when George-Washington 's troops were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to build American power as rapidly as possible . He thinks that the U.S. should always apply pressure where It hurts and where it can be sustained . And yet ? there 's always a surprise  --  unlike many of his conservative colleagues , he does n't worry about the Panama Canal treaties . Even if the U.S. had kept control , he says , " you could sabotage that canal with a Boy Scout troop . " When he was in prison , from July 18 , 196S. until Feb. 12 , 1973 , he thought about his country and why it was special . The American way of life , he concludedi is " pluralistic . It relies an the free-enterprise system . which exploits the self-improvement propensity of the American people . That 's not good or bad . It 's amoral . But it 's the way it is . The Christian ethic is pervasive all through it . That means compassion . It means government stepping in when absolutely necessary to make sure the disadvantaged and the helpless do n't simply cat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American way of life , he was becoming more and more fervent in his belief in God . " We all got religious as hell over there , " he says . Traumatic Homecoming He came home to find X-rated movies , massage parlors , drugs and a wide-ranging contempt for America and its role in the world . " It was all new to me , " he says . He decided he could fight for his principles better in private life , so he resigned his commission and organized a group called the Coalition for Decency . The idea , he says , " was to teach kids about comparative politics so they 'd be able to understand what the ball game was all about when they got old enough to vote . " He believes in God , family and the home . It was the foundation upon which he built his campaign . But he really did n't say adulterers should get the death penalty , What he did say , he explains , is that in some subsistence societies ? in Afghanistan , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family and destroys the ability of its members to sustain themselves : Those societies impose severe Penalties upon adulterers . " But , " he says , " in more sophisticated societies , it is n't necessary to impose the death penalty or even cut off the offender 's hand . " He concedes that even his own friends here in Washington feel better about him , knowing that that is his position .
