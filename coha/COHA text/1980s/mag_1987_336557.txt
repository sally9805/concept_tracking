It could be the most telling test to date of Mikhail Gorbachev 's widely touted " new thinking " in foreign policy , the idea that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. have areas of mutual interest where what benefits one side might also benefit the other . Or it could end up provoking an old-fashioned zero-sum conflict , where one superpower seeks advantage in a strategic corner of the globe at the other 's expense . As America 's Navy becomes ever more involved in the Persian Gulf war , the Soviet Union looms just over the horizon , its border only 600 miles from the gulf and its warships prowling its waters . Nowhere is the danger of competition greater , yet nowhere is the potential for cooperation more real : both sides want to keep the sea-lanes open , end the fighting and prevent the Ayatullah from triumphing . <P> Whether Washington and Moscow can work together in pursuing those goals will affect not only a Reagan-Gorbachev summit but also the possibility for a new era in Soviet-American relations . Secretary of State George Shultz leaves this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle East , then to Moscow . There he will probe and poke at all the old U.S.-Soviet problems to see if Gorbachev 's talk of new thinking is real or merely rhetorical . Shultz has been leading the Reagan Administration 's effort to seek out potential areas of cooperation as a way of testing Soviet intentions . Of all the issues that American officials have been canvassing , none is getting more attention than the basket of troubles in the Middle East , where the shots being fired in the eighth year of the Iran-Iraq war are now being heard round the world . <P> There are promising signs . The U.S. and U.S.S.R. voted together and stood firmly behind the cease-fire resolution adopted in July by the U.N . Security Council . Iraq agreed to comply , but Iran resisted . Moscow argued that the time was not right for a resolution banning all arms sales to Iran . After talking it over with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in New York , Shultz agreed to stop pressing for an immediate arms embargo and back efforts to achieve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Soviets have strong reasons to want the gulf war ended . Although they are talking of building pipelines and a railroad for Iran , they have backed Iraq in the war , supplying at least 70% of the arms used to prevent Iran 's vastly larger forces from sweeping across the country . A defeat for Iraq would damage Moscow 's standing with Arab regimes . Even worse , a triumph for Islamic revolutionary forces led by Tehran might destabilize borderlands inhabited by some 50 million Soviet Muslims . As a peacemaker , Moscow would stand to gain in all camps and strengthen its position in the gulf . <P> Gorbachev has recently supplemented his ideas about new thinking in foreign policy with a call to broaden the U.N . role in adjudicating regional disputes . But Moscow has made soothing noises in the past that have led nowhere . The optimistic " Spirit of Geneva " of 1955 , an atmospheric condition following a summit with Stalin 's immediate successors , proved to be a psychological mood devoid of any substance . The Nixon-Brezhnev summit of 1972 yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code of superpower conduct in the world that was honored by Moscow almost entirely in the breach .
