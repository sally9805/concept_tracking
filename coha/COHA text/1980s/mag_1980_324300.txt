Until a cap is formed , Mount St. Helens may continue rumbling <P> When Mount St. Helens finally blew its top after almost two months of rumbling and sputtering , the show was spectacular enough that it hardly required an encore for a century or so . But last week the seemingly inexhaustible volcano gave another lively performance . A second major eruption shook the mountain over the Memorial Day weekend , and steam and ash belched forth in fitful bursts throughout the week . More ominously , seismologists detected tremors originating from deep within the volcano 's molten rock core , another sign of restlessness . <P> To add to the jitters of beleaguered residents , two moderate earthquakes suddenly jolted Mount Margaret , a peak only 13 km ( eight miles ) northeast of Mount St. Helens . Though scientists emphasized that these seismic disturbances were not hints of an impending eruption , the tremors only added to what might be called a case of tectonic fever on the West Coast . Hundreds of small earthquakes shook the Sierra Nevada in central California , causing landslides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured above 4.0 on the Richter scale and three reached 6.0 or higher , levels at which there would have been more widespread destruction in populated areas . <P> None of this earth activity appeared directly related to Mount St. Helens . And , indeed , by midweek Tim Hait , the U.S. Geological Survey 's chief spokesman at the scene , was describing Mount St. Helens as " in a relaxed state of mind . " But none of the U.S.G.S. scientists would say how long the calm would last . After Mount St. Helens rose from its slumber in 1831 , it erupted 14 times in the next 25 years . Says Hait : " This time it could go on for five years , ten years or 20 years . That 's a heck of an answer but there 's no way of telling . " <P> The latest round of activity caught scientists by surprise . Though volcanologists have been able to predict almost to the hour when the volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands will erupt , Mount St. Helens presents a more difficult problem for would-be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington volcano is a thicker , silica-rich material ( unlike the less viscous molten basalt of the Hawaiian chain ) ; more pressure must build up before the hot gases trapped within it are released . Thus the mountain erupts infrequently and violently . <P> No one can tell for sure how soon the mountain will clear itself of these pent-up gases , but U.S.G.S. scientists were saying last week that they would not be surprised if Mount St. Helens continued venting steam , ash and pumice intermittently for another ten or 15 years . The reason , the scientists explained , is that it could take that long for the volcano to complete the internal rebuilding process that will seal it off again .
