But there is something else on the horizon , almost too small to notice at first glance . It is a little knot of mourners gathered at the water ' s edge , waiting for this alien lake to give them back the bodies of its first victims , their sons and fathers. // The people are Ibans , the longhouse-dwellers of Sarawak , a Malaysian state on the north coast of the island of Borneo . The remainder of Malaysia is on the Malay Peninsula. // Here at the Batang Ai Hydroelectric Project , almost every aspect of the Ibans ' traditional life has been shattered by what the state government in Kuching believes is necessary progress and development. // Old longhouses have been replaced by " store bought " models they have to pay for . Slash-and-burn agriculture has given way to fixed acreages and cash crops that introduce a purely monetary economy in place of barter . Daily activity has been disrupted ; there is disorientation . <> <> Wilderness Is Gone // It was a slender longboat of hewn wood , built to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai reservoir with 15 men aboard , too far from shore for seven of them to swim . The men had been hunting upstream in their familiar haunts and were trying to return to their new homes on the downstream side of the dam , where there is no more wilderness. // For Sarawak , for Malaysia , the name Batang Ai has become synonymous with controversy. // For an outsider who listens one day to the state ' s Chief Minister , Abdul Taib Mahmud , argue his case for rapid development , and then sits among the Ibans to hear their point of view , Batang Ai comes to symbolize the quandary faced by an emerging nation. // " In Sarawak we have two million acres of empty land , " Mr. Taib said in an interview in his office overlooking the mountains that circle Kuching . " The greatest challenge is how to have large-scale development in which all the people can take part. " // Mr. Taib , who is 49 years old , is critical of those who would , in his words , " overprotect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the hope that benefits will trickle down from urban to rural life without social change in the countryside is unrealisitic and , in the end , damaging to the people themselves. // He points out that large numbers of Ibans and other tribal people from around the state are already drifting into squatter settlements in the capital . Those who are left behind , he said - the very young and the elderly - have no assets but their land , which they are beginning to sell for income at disastrously low prices , or lease to lumbering companies that strip it and leave. // " Some villages are becoming ghost towns , " Mr. Taib said . " Sixty percent of our villages now have fewer than 100 families . " Sarawak , Malaysia ' s largest state , has one of the country ' s highest poverty levels. // Officials in Kuching and at Batang Ai say they have gone to great lengths to make the resettlement of about 500 families as painless as possible. // At Sarawak Museum in Kuching , the curator , Lucas Chin , explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moving ancestral graves that would have been submerged by the new lake . A Choice of New Longhouses The Ibans were given a choice of replacement longhouses . All models were designed to conform to the traditional building , with its two verandas , one an uncovered porch , the other roofed , and its separate homes inside for each family . The population of a longhouse is calculated in " doors " - one door covers a family of about eight people . Long-established longhouses can have 20 or more " doors. " // Officials say the new longhouses have piped water and electricity and will soon benefit from services such as clinics and schools. // The 68-year-old Iban chief , Penjhulu Munchat , the proud descendant of headhunters , acknowledges that life is materially better now . But the chief , who keeps in his quarters a beheading sword with a shock of human hair and a small piece of field artillery captured from a British expeditionary force , says he is still awaiting compensation for the crops he lost on his old land. // " There is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our life , " he added . " People are not all so happy because they need land . There are jobs here , but not enough for everyone to be employed . " Some Ibans Spurn Resettlement Faced for the first time with the requirement that they pay for their new homes and for the public services provided , using their compensation payments , some Ibans have refused to comply . Some Iban families spurned resettlement and fled higher into the hills. // There have been small acts of sabotage - the stealing of ignition keys from construction equipment , for example . One state housing official , an Iban himself , said with a slashing gesture to his neck that he was " threatened with the chop " when tensions were running high over the move. // Sarawak government agricultural officials are trying to turn the displaced Ibans into cultivators of plantation crops , particularly oil palm and cocoa . A palm oil extraction plant is already in operation nearby . But development moves slowly , and many Ibans are idle in the meantime , they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or failure of the Batang Ai project will play a major role in determining the pace and scale of future development in Sarawak , officials say. // Sarawak ' s rivers could supply all of Malaysia , and much of Southeast Asia , with electrical power . There is also gas and oil , timber and those miles of unused agricultural land. // The people of Sarawak could all live reasonably well , Mr. Taib said . The problem is to teach them how to make the most of themselves and their assets. // " They want change , " he said , " and yet they are afraid of change . I say , If you want to go fishing , you have to get your feet wet. " //
