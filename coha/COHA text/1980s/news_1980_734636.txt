txt Q ? Last August , I ordered a pair of " ultra view " glasses from the Optique Boutique , 835 N. Michigan Av. , from a prescription from my ophthalmologist . When I returned to pick up my glasses , I could tell immediately that something was wrong , as my vision was blurred looking across the room . On attempting to read , I found it necessary to manually raise the glasses to a better level so I could see the print . Optique Boutique suggested that I take them home and attempt to get used to them , which I hesitantly did . I returned a few days later and informed the store that the glasses were useless to me as they did not fit my eyes . I had , in the meantime , returned to my ophthalmologist who said that the glasses were improperly fitted . I then ordered a new pair from my doctor . I told the Optique Boutique that I would like a credit for the glasses and that I would forget the entire incident . They refused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no refund . I do not need another pair of bifocal glasses at this point . Nor do I intend to have Optique Boutique fitting me with glasses again .
