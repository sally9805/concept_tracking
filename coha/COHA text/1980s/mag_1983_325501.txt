Some kind of night at the opera <P> It is not an everyday event for a woman to rise topless from a large cauldron in Memphis . But when Cheryllynn Ross did so last week as Hecate during the New York-based Metropolitan Opera touring performance of Macbeth , she was risking more than a chill : the city 's tough new antinudity ordinance , aimed chiefly at topless dancers , could have brought quick arrest . Two division commanders of the local police were on the scene . Would they rush the cauldron and haul its contents off to the slammer ? <P> Well , no . But as the curtain went up a stir in the back of the first balcony proved almost as dramatic . At a cry of " Bravo ! " - " Brava ! " would have been more correct-20 men and women bared their chests and held up candles , lighters and flashlights so that their fellow opera lovers in the audience of 2,360 could catch their act . All were members of an antiordinance group called MASH ( Memphians Against Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savarin to combat MAD ( Memphians Against Degeneracy ) , the pro-ordinance lobby . Rudi E.

Carey Wong , of Opera Memphis , was rhapsodic : " It was a lovely gesture , a captivating moment . " David Reuben , spokesman for the Met tour , suggested that if the Met could survive the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco , where it performed Carmen with Caruso , it would probably survive the topless tremors in Tennessee too . <P> To many Memphis residents , upset by the proliferation of adult bookstores and topless nightclubs , MAD is not out of its mind . But even though Police Director John Holt insisted after the protest that the ordinance would still be enforced , he announced his own surprise : three high-ranking police officers on duty that night were put on suspension , without pay , two of them for being in the vicinity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fray with a declaration that policemen , like all other citizens , are entitled to go to the opera . As for MAD , perhaps it could expand to meet the new crisis , possibly forming new groups called Memphians Against Damsels Doing Ecdysiast Routines ( MADDER ) , Memphians Against Chest Hair at Operas ( MACHO ) or , to honor the Met , Memphians Against Culture Buffs Exposing Themselves Heedlessly ( MACBETH ) .
