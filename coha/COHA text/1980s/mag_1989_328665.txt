LEADER OF THE BAND by Fay Weldon <P> Viking ; 196 pages ; $18.95 <P> Sandra Sorenson , 42 , is an astronomer who is quasi famous for having discovered a new planet in the solar system . She appears once a month on late- night British TV to discuss the universe , and has been dubbed " Starlady Sandra " by the tabloids . But recognition does not satisfy her , and neither does her husband Matthew , an ambitious lawyer and tepid bedmate ( " What 's good enough for missionaries is good enough for me " ) . So Sandra does what any woman in her fix would do : she runs off with Jack Stubbs , the trumpet player in a ragtag band called the Citronella Jumpers . <P> This premise of Leader of the Band suggests why Fay Weldon , 55 , remains an engaging outsider among the generous circle of contemporary feminist writers . Her twelve previous novels feature a number of heroines unsettlingly prone to confirming male stereotypes about the opposite sex .

Starlady Sandra knows that her new passion will demand the suppression of her lively intelligence : " If only I can hold my tongue I might yet be the one he keeps in his bed , for ever . Craven , yes indeed , but there it is . My female lost to his male . " <P> Yet Sandra , like most of Weldon 's women , manages to wrest victory out of surrender . For one thing , she tells the story of her flight from boring respectability to middle-aged hedonism with bawdy , invigorating wit ; silence may be her best defense in the presence of her new lover , but she is irrepressibly outspoken when she sets pen to paper . " Look , I 'm really something , me , " she tells herself . " And also I am nothing , " she continues , in a characteristic about-face . " I am the debris of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between the proud , the mad and the murderous . " <P> By this she means the peculiar twain of her parentage . Her father had been a Nazi officer , labeled the " Mad Sadist of Bleritz " for his genetic experiments in a concentration camp and executed after being tried at Nuremberg . One of his victims was the half-gypsy girl who became Sandra 's mother . She was , the daughter notes ironically , " really lucky , and was all of 15 when I was born , at the very end of the war . " Sandra , of course , never knew her father , and the mother who raised her was demonstratively sinking into madness . Given the bizarre facts of her conception , the heroine has - created for herself a special identity : " I am an ordinary person , but carried to extremes . " And her mission in life is clear , at least to her : " I make myself deaf to the pleas of the unborn .
