More presidential security <P> When King Birendra of Nepal departed from the southwest gate of the White House last week after a state visit with President Reagan , his limousine was forced to make an abrupt turn to weave its way slowly past a narrow , 3-ft-high stretch of concrete block . The V-shaped barricades took the place of three sand-filled dump trucks that had blocked the gate after threats had been received from Shi'ite groups . These are only the latest in a series of security measures aimed at better protecting the President and fortifying the White House against possible terrorist attacks . <P> New safeguards were in operation when the President visited Indianapolis to address the National Forum on Excellence in Education .

Presidents have been protected from an air attack by a cache of ground-to-air missiles that are hidden near the White House . From a command and control center in the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House , security officers closely monitor all aircraft using nearby National Airport ; they have less than a minute to decide whether to fire if a plane deviates suspiciously from an established flight pattern . Officials refuse to say what types of missiles are used . <P> The Secret Service has seen its budget boosted since Reagan took office . The 1984 budget calls for more than $270 million , up $30 million from last year . Explains Chief of Staff James Baker : " The fact that we tend to be very responsive to their requests stems from the fact that we almost lost this President . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
