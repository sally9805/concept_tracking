txt It begins like a familiar tale  --  to say nothing of a frequent editorial tantrum  --  that is , the story begins with furious voters , nervous congresspeople and a federal agency with a huge off-budget credit line . Yet the plot is not unfolding according to the standard script . The furious voters are farmers . Why ? Well , consider the chickens coming home to roost on American farms . Over the past several years , farmers increased their debt even while total farm income collapsed . But now they 're angry because low crop prices , falling land prices and high interest rates are transforming what seemed to be reasonable leverage into farm foreclosures . Last year , for example , one-quarter of the 270,000 farmers holding loans from the Farmers Home Administration were delinquent and 8,000 went out of biz  --  about 800 of those through forced foreclosures . The figures are dramatic enough . But when the drama appears on the nightly news in the form of farmers shouting and shaking their fists at foreclosure auctions , it 's bound to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue , Congress entered center-front . Last session , both houses voted millions in new loan money , to be guaranteed by the Farmers Home Administration . ( Congress however muffed it : The Economic Emergency Program itself expired last September , hence rendering the new funds unusable . ) More recently , a House subcommittee voted $600 million for farm-operating funds for the 17 states which have already run out of money . - And that brings us to the third player , the allocator of farm loans , the FmHA . This agency , under the Department of Agriculture , runs over 30 programs to provide way-below market credit . At the moment , the FmHA has almost $60 billion in outstanding loans . That makes it the largest government lending operation . It 's also an attractive one : Its money comes from the Federal Financing Bank , the off-budget way to go . Thus , Congress can use the FmHA to mete out money to voters without fear of on-budget reprisals , like inflating the deficit . But , alas , the FmHA has been quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices have been , well , questionable . Two GAO reports this year castigated the agency 's emergency and disaster loan programs for making billions in improper loans . And here the plot begins to twist in a pleasantly surprising fashion . Under the Reagan administration , the agency has acted to tighten up on its lax practices . In fact , due mostly to new procedures , this year the FmHA will come in , gasp , about a billion short of its estimated spending . Now with this achievement beckoning , it 's no wonder the agency is leary of any congressional interference . Indeed , it has actually stopped Congress from freighting it with more spending : When the aforementioned House committee voted to increase its operating fund , the agency quietly " reprogrammed " some money from other programs into the operating fund . It then told the committee thanks-but-nothanks , we can get along without more money . An almost unheard of chapter in the book of bureaucratic procedures . Now if this could become even a twice-told tale  --  to say nothing of a tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully stop throwing editorial tantrums over government farm credit policies . Indeed , we found this an altogether rewarding tale to tell ; although , admittedly , it probably belongs in Ripley 's " Believe It or Not . "
