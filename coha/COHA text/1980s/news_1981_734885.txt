txt Just as scientists regard a perpetual , motion machine as impossible , econo , mists long ago gave up the search for a free lunch a government program that helps one group of people without costing-anyone else a dime . But in Springfield , State Treasurer Jerry Cosentino is still chasing that will o ' the wisp . Mr. Cosentino wants to set up a state Agricultural Development Authority to nonce purchases of farm machinery . The authority would issue tax-exempt bonds , depositing the funds in those banks willing to lend it to farmers who otherwise ca n't get credit . Under a federal pro-. gram , 90 per cent of each loan would be guaranteed by the Farmers Home Administration ( FmHA ) . By Mr. Coseno tino 's estimate , the bonds would be issued at about 9 ' / , per cent interest , enabling the banks to charge 11 per cent : or less . The illusion here is that because no federal or state funds are given directly to farmers , the taxpaying public bears no burden . Guaranteed loans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that are n't repaid by the recipients have to be paid for by someone , and it wo n't be Mr. Cosentino . The FmHA , for example , has to write off an alarming proportion of its direct loans to farmers ? 8 per cent of farm ownership loans and 21 per cent of operating loans . There is no reason to think a new authority would fare much better , since its sole reason for existence would be to provide loans to precisely those farmers who are least likely to repay them . The . authoiify walk/ perversely encourage farmers to overextend themselves , since anyone who wants to qualify must first be turned down by a specified number of banks . Programs like these , of whichthere are too many already , reward inefficiency and penal/7P success ? a silly policy in the best of times , but especially . indefensible when the nation 's productivity is declining . There is a growing and unfortunate ' tendency to regard tax-exempt bonds as a cheap and painless way to subsidize things . ' Much of the gravy inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who buy them to escape taxes  --  and the wealthier , the greater the break . In this case , Illinois might indeed gain something at the expense of the rest of the country , since both the taxes forgone and 90 per cent of the costs of the delinquent loans would , come out of the federal treasury . But looking out for Na. 1 is no way to make public policy . Still , the interest groups lined up behind Mr. Cosentino 's proposal should en- ' sure it at least a reasonable chance for enactment , though the Reagan administration may wreck the plan by slashing the FmHA budget . Farmers obviously ' have something to gain from this subsidy , as do the farm machinery manufacturers like John Deere Co. and International Harvester Co. which , according to the Treasurer 's office , have praised the suggestion . Mr. Cosentino , an ambitious man , has not neglected to provide for himself in this scheme : One of the five governing members of the authority would be the state treasurer . But what is good for Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the . state 's farmers is n't good for the rest of us . In the short run , Illinois may benefit from programs like this which give the state one more tap into the federal treasury . In the long run , however , special interest subsidies hobble and distort the economy and waste scarce federal funds . From that damage , we all lose .
