In response to letters protesting dumping of toxic wastes for fear of aggravated land , water and human life destruction/pollution , I add this . Let us cease blaming the state , the industrial plant , the government and the companies who create the toxic waste . We are forever trying to remedy the symptoms of a problem . In the case of environmental pollution , we should remedy the cause . The cause of this problem is really the people who continue to buy poison-producing products , those items that are not biodegradable . ISOBEL MANN Brookline Is this any way to run a post office ? When will patrons of the Rowley Post Office protest over the inefficient service to which they have been subjected for more than 10 years ? I do not feel that a patron should stand at the counter awaiting the finish of some earnest discussion out-back , with the feeling that the clerks are doing him a favor just to wait on him eventually . I do not think a patron should be inconvenienced by " we ' ll have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they don ' t send us any stamps . " I do not believe that a patron should feel the need for a degree in paperhanging in order to amass meager- denomination stamps on a package . I can ' t believe that proper denominated stamps are not as available in Rowley as elsewhere . I also can not believe that they can ' t keep sufficient cash on hand so one doesn ' t have to wait for a clerk to go to the nearest bank for change . ALDENE E. GORDON Rowley Arabs retain land The Globe Explainer of June 20 distorts history by stating that the West Bank and Gaza Strip " were all that were left to the Arabs of what had once been the British Mandate of Palestine . " The Palestine Mandate , including the present territory of Israel and Jordan , was assigned to Great Britain by the Conference of San Remo in 1920 . Subsequently , while still under the British Palestine Mandate , the territory of Transjordan was separated for the express purpose of excluding it from a future Jewish national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Jordan , which can legitimately be regarded as a Palestinian Arab state . In the territory of Jordan , the Arabs retain more than three-fourths of the British Mandate of Palestine . STEVEN M. SUSSMAN Newton Centre Better Rula Lenska Heaven help The Globe readers if every week we have to suffer through articles such as the ones you have chosen to write on " Jacqui and Bob , " their **29;185;TOOLONG parents , and the ( yawn ) boring story of their year-long engagement and final marriage . If this is classified as a human interest story , we can only think of about 350 readers who would be interested ; namely , their family and friends . Do we now eagerly await articles on Jacqui ' s and Bob ' s honeymoon , updated anniversaries , first baby or , preferably , their " traditional " divorce ? If you feel compelled to write about someone ' s engagement and marriage , why not someone interesting like Rula Lenska or Rosie Ruiz ? DONNA DiIESO PAULA RAVAIOLI Malden Editorial Points The hostages , it is said , spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new idea of cruel and unusual punishment . Down South there ' s a river called the French Broad , but nobody seems to know for whom it was named . The Republicans are against the Equal Rights Amendment . What was good enough for Mrs. Chester A. Arthur ... Los Angeles wants the 1984 Olympic games , and what if the Russians say tit for tat and won ' t come ? Some have guilt feelings and others , given the chance , would do it again in spades . After seeing an All Star ball player mess up a grounder , it ' s easy to believe in the fallibility of great statesmen .
