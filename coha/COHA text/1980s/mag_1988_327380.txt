Edward is a dog , a sad-eyed but otherwise lively Welsh corgi . When he is upset he makes trouble of a colorful , forgivable kind . Macon Leary ( William Hurt ) is his master , also sad-eyed , but with no redeeming manners or habits . Early in this lugubrious recounting of his struggle against clinical depression , one begins counting the minutes between dog cutaways . By the end , one is praying for them . <P> This is not to say that Macon 's gloom is without just cause . A year before The Accidental Tourist begins , his beloved son has been killed in a particularly senseless crime . As the film opens , his wife Sarah ( Kathleen Turner ) walks out on him because his grief has made him so deeply withdrawn that he can not help her bear her sorrow . Her departure leaves Macon with his dismal career as a writer of travel books for people who hate traveling ; with the dubious consolations of his own family , a sister and two brothers who are as joylessly guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , the excellent but increasingly ( and understandably ) snappish company of Edward . <P> Muriel Pritchett ( Geena Davis ) , who insinuates herself into Macon 's life by becoming Edward 's trainer , does wonders for both of them . Doggy learns to heel , master learns to lighten up . Or so we are supposed to believe , though it is very hard to tell the difference between William Hurt sad and William Hurt happy , so monotonous is his performance of a monosyllabic role . <P> There should have been a dramatic crux : Macon 's desertion of Muriel for an attempted reconciliation with his wife . But the tone and dynamics of this scene are indistinguishable from the rest of a film that looks as if it had been shot in a brownout . Depression , obviously , is not amusing . But depressives , as the history of humor from Mark Twain to S.J. Perelman proves , can be . Anyway , it should be possible to analyze an illness without falling prey to it . <P> In the end , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper-cute novel is dim . Director Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill ) knows how to get Edward on and off screen effectively , but he is far less witty and adroit with his nominal stars . Dim too is the judgment of the New York Film Critics Circle , which last week named Tourist best English- language picture of the year .
