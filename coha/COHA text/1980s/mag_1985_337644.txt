The buildup began in February . In the dead of night , 200 men in camouflage uniforms , each carrying a new AK-47 rifle and two grenades , left their secret training camps in India and gathered by the edge of the sea . At a quiet command , they slipped into plastic , wide-bottomed boats and set off , guided by fishermen who steered by the stars . In less than two hours , the fighters had crossed 26 miles of the Palk Strait and were wading ashore , ready to wage war in Sri Lanka . <P> Virtually every night since then , small groups of guerrillas have stolen across the waters to prepare for a showdown battle with the Sri Lankan army . Last week the war all but broke out . First the rebels , who represent the island 's 2.6 million mostly Hindu Tamils in a separatist struggle against 11 million mainly Buddhist Sinhalese , killed three civilians whom they suspected of being government informers . Then they planted a bomb that ripped apart sections of a train in the capital , Colombo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off electricity in the northern city of Jaffna , blasted the town hall and municipal offices with explosives and attacked the heavily fortified police station . After the biggest battle of the year , said a government spokesman , 21 Tamils and five policemen were dead . <P> Over the past two years , the guerrillas ' increasingly intensive struggle to win an independent homeland ( known in Tamil as Eelam ) within the northern and southeastern parts of the island has brought Sri Lanka perilously close to full-scale civil war . Today much of Sri Lanka 's northern region , which is heavily populated by Tamils , is under de facto military rule , garrisoned by nearly half the 12,000-man-strong Sri Lankan army . Since the collapse of ; negotiations between the government of President J.R . Jayawardene and leading Tamil politicians last December , more than 700 people , mostly civilians , have been killed . Says Lalith Athulathmudali , Jayawardene 's Minister of National Security : " This is the most dangerous time Sri Lanka has ever known . " <P> The danger has been building ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the Tamils see it , discrimination by the Sinhalese majority has gradually eroded their political rights . <P> " The Tamils , " says a U.S. official , " have been on the losing end of Sri Lankan democracy for decades . " Simmering unrest finally came to a boil in July 1983 . After the Tigers killed 13 soldiers in an ambush , Sinhalese mobs ran wild through Colombo , killing at least 412 Tamils and leaving 100,000 others homeless . <P> Since then , despite a government-imposed shoot-on-sight nightly curfew in the north , the Tigers have steadily increased the pressure , assaulting government strongholds , ambushing army convoys and derailing trains . By now the insurgents , grouped in six separate organizations , claim to have 1,000 guerrillas deployed in Sri Lanka and an additional 7,000 at the ready in India . They are assisted by 200 advisers from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine .
