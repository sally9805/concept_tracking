In Bonn , the construction of coalitions gets complicated <P> The parliamentary ploy bears the sinister label of Knigsmord ( murder of a king ) , but the intent is entirely bloodless . As soon as Chancellor Helmut Schmidt 's ruling coalition crumbled two weeks ago , Opposition Leader Helmut Kohl pressed ahead with his plan to become West Germany 's first Christian Democratic Chancellor in 13 years . Rebuffing Schmidt 's call for elections , Kohl prepared to introduce a rarely used vote of no confidence in the Bundestag to bring down Schmidt 's minority government immediately . If his strategy works , Kohl will move into the modern glass-and-steel Chancellery along the bank of the Rhine this week . <P> But the staid predictability of Bonn politics quickly took on the intrigue of a Florentine court last week . Initially , Kohl was confident that former Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher , leader of the centrist Free Democrats who bolted Schmidt 's government , could deliver at least 33 votes from his party 's 51 members of parliament . This total would provide Kohl 259 votes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's S.P.D. has only 215 seats , and depended on heavy Free Democrat support to stay in office . Kohl and Genscher had been talking quietly of creating a new center-right coalition for more than a year , ever since the Free Democrats began slipping badly in the polls as a result of factional disputes plaguing Schmidt 's Social Democrats . <P> Kohl and Genscher , however , were unprepared for two challenges that made their task more complicated and the ultimate outcome less certain . Genscher was confronted by an outburst of opposition from left-leaning elements in his party about the wisdom of breaking with the Social Democrats . And Franz Josef Strauss , leader of the Christian Social Union , the Christian Democratic Union 's sister party in Bavaria , raised his thunderous voice against the notion of merging with the Free Democrats . Insisting that " a marriage without love " was not destined to endure , Strauss issued a " nonnegotiable " demand for national elections by the end of the year . He expected that the Christian Democrats would win a majority , allowing them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent shivers of fear through the Free Democrats . Genscher had repeatedly stressed to Kohl that he needed time to repair the damage to his party 's popularity and that a rush to new elections could prove fatal . The respected Allensbach Institute produced a snap poll last week showing that popular support for the Free Democrats had dropped to 2.3% , a precipitous decline from the 10.6% they won in the 1980 national elections . According to the West German constitution , a party must get at least 5% of the vote to be represented in parliament . After hearing Strauss 's demand , Genscher declared that unless elections were delayed until next year , he would not provide the votes necessary to elect Kohl Chancellor .
