THE PALACE <P> by Paul Erdman <P> Doubleday ; 313 pages ; $18.95 <P> It seems like only yesterday that it was next year . Paul Erdman 's The Panic of ' 89 was on the best-seller lists , sounding financial doom in the midst of a powerful bull market . That was , in fact , in the winter of ' 87 , nine months before reality iced Wall Street . Erdman does not have to worry ; quicker than a program trade , here he is , hedging his investments with a sixth novel . The Palace offers no scenario for economic disaster . Quite the contrary . The book is a racy tale of how one clever and gutsy ( though not especially honest ) fellow can rise from being a Philadelphia coin dealer to owning the splashiest gambling casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City . <P> Erdman , a former banker in Switzerland , knows all the tricks of pecuniary titillation . The main characters are all endowed with big bottom lines . Short , grubby Danny Lehman , the dubious hero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . Lehman is a loner who outwits the law and organized crime and favors the company of a hooker who reads Dostoyevsky . All things considered , he is more appealing than the run-of-the-mill Sammy Glick . Erdman 's knowledge about money laundering and creative financing firmly establishes the novel 's authority . An unabashed weakness for shady operators and a hearty sense of the vulgar should ensure his market share . <P> CROSSING OPEN GROUND <P> by Barry Lopez <P> Scribners ; 208 pages ; $17.95 <P> Barry Lopez 's Arctic Dreams was the surprise winner of the 1986 American Book Award for nonfiction . This collection of short pieces about the American Southwest , Alaska , endangered wildlife and forgotten cultures is in the same vein . Much of the ground covered is by now well trodden , though Lopez has a light step . He glides over pre-Columbian history , kicking up bits of ornithology , geology and marine biology . His best entry is about beached whales on the Oregon coast and the peculiar behavior these leviathans caused in the local population . The author is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken by a political ripple ( the conservation policies of the Reagan Administration , for example , are found wanting , mainly because there are so few of them ) . Lopez offers no specific program for balancing the ecosystem . Rather , he tries to create an aura of reverence for nature that sometimes has the look of born-again paganism . With musical accompaniment by Paul Winter , a trail companion in one of the book 's selections , Lopez could become a guru of the New Age movement . <P> CIVIL TO STRANGERS <P> by Barbara Pym <P> Dutton ; 388 pages ; $18.95
