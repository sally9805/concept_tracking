txt IT 'S HARD TO FIND advertising more popular than American Express Co. ' s " Do you know me ? " campaign . Johnny Carson and " Saturday Night Live " have parodied it affectionately . Hundreds of people have written to American Express and its ad agency asking to be in the ads . Most significantly , in the campaign 's nine years on TV , the number of American Express cardholders in the U.S. has quadrupled to 12 million . Why then is Jerry Welsh , the American Express senior vice president in charge of marketing the card , talking about changing the commercials even as they help bring in record numbers of applicants ? " We 're trying to redecorate our apartment , " he explains , " while the cocktail party is still going on . " The problem is that , after 25 years of pursuing affluent , frequenttraveling businessmen , American Express has won over about 40% of those it considers worthy of its card . The financial-services company needs to find new prospects . That has Mr. Welsh contemplating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what customers want when they pay $35 a year for its basic green card . The company always has defined prestige as success and attainment and , in 60 commercials produced since 1974 , personified it with famous but not familiar entertainers ( Mel Blanc , Benny Goodman , Luciano Pavarotti ) , athletes ( Jesse Owens , Pele , Rusty Staub ) , executives ( George Gallup , ? Roy Jacuzzi ) , politicians ( Sam Ervin , William Miller ) and others . BUT MANY PEOPLE , especially women and younger men , are n't thinking of prestige that way any longer , Mr. Welsh suspects . Instead , he says , they 're defining it as " leading an interesting , varied , unexpectedly rich life . " His theory holds that many of those outside American Express 's usual customers see prestige attached to those who have interesting hobbies or skills , have lived in several places or have had more than one career . Brain surgeons have prestige by the old definition ; brain surgeons who also ride motorcycles , by the new one . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professor of Russian and lived in Tennessee until joining American Express in New York in 1975 ) comes to these conclusions as a result of American Express 's attempts to sign up more women cardholders . The company had been wooing women for years . A magazine ad in the early 1970s showed a cigar-smoking man , described as a " former male chauvinist pig , " saying : " It 's time women got their own American Express card and started taking me to dinner . " More women ( actress Barbara Feldon , conductor Sarah Caldwell ) were shown in " Do you know me ? " commercials . Such efforts accomplished little . American Express estimates that its 2% million female cardholders represent only about 20% of the women that meet its financial , occupational and life-style criteria . Male cardholders outnumber women 4-to-1. sOME REASONS WHY became clearer to American Express executives early last year as they listened to a group of Atlanta women , participants in a market-research panel , discuss credit cards . " What absolutely floored me , " recalls Mr. Welsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Express and laudatory about it , yet they did n't see the American Express card as something for them . " The sort of prestige promoted in " Do you know me ? " ads appealed mostly to men . So Ogilvy &; Mather , the company 's ad agency , was assigned to write ads geared to women . The result is a campaign that is running in 16 national women 's magazines and on TV in seven cities  --  San Francisco , Houston , New York , Philadelphia , Boston , Chicago and Washington , D.C. ? that make up about one-fourth of the U.S. population . Although " Do you know me ? " continues to dominate the advertising there , it is accompanied by a campaign that does away with celebrities . Instead , the TV commercials feature confident , independent women using their American Express cards . In one ad , a briefcasetoting woman takes her husband to dinner to celebrate her , first American Express card . In another , a mother  --  her marital status undisclosed  --  trades wisecracks with her kids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bookstore playfully fending off a flirtatious man . The American Express card , a female announcer says in each spot , is " part of a lot of interesting lives . " THAT SLOGAN also is carried in the print ads ; all other copy has been eliminated . One shows a woman cross-country skiing , her infant in a carrier on her front . Another features a dress-for-success woman leaving a sporting goods shop , carrying her briefcase in one hand and a lacrosse stick in the other . In cities where the commercials have been shown , American Express has found , the number of women who say they feel the company is interested in them has nearly tripled . The number who plan to apply for a card has doubled , surprising the company and ad agency . " We were hoping to change attitudes , not behavior , " ex : plains Mayling Dodgin , the Ogilvy account supervisor . The success of the " Interesting Lives " campaign , as American Express calls it , has led Mr. Welsh to ask his associates at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new campaign 's definition of prestige with  --  the one in " Do you know me ? " His goal is to keep up with sociological trends and to be ready in case the appeal of " Do you know me ? " starts to wear out . Although " Interesting Lives " will be used more extensively , American Express wo n't abandon its main campaign anytime soon . " You simply do n't walk away , " says Mr. Welsh , " from one of the most successful campaigns in the history of advertising . "
