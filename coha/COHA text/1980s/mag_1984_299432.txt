Bargain-basement rivals push OPEC toward another price cut <P> The markdown mania took off as suddenly as a price war on computers or toasters . But the merchandise that went on sale was crude oil . Early last week Norway 's state oil company triggered a chain reaction among petroleum exporters by offering its $30-per-bbl . North Sea crude for $28.50 . Two days later Britain , a much larger producer , followed suit with a $1.35 cut on its Brent crude , to $28.65 . For oil exporters the events were ominously familiar . When Norway and Britain officially discounted their oil in February 1983 , the move forced the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to make its first price cut in history , a $5-per-bbl. markdown , to $29 for the benchmark Arab Light crude . <P> The new round of discounting threatened to push the 13 members of OPEC toward a second painful price cut . The countries immediately made plans for an emergency meeting next week in Geneva , where they hoped to devise a plan for holding the line on prices . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke ranks . Nigeria , one of the poorest OPEC countries , cut the price of its Bonny Light crude by $2 , to $28 , in order to prevent a decline in sales . Nigerian Oil Minister Tarn David-West said the country had to place its own economic health on a higher priority than its loyalty to OPEC . <P> Nigeria 's decision made it more likely that other restless members , like Abu Dhabi , will tear away , possibly leading to anarchy among OPEC members and a sharp slide in oil prices . " This has got to panic every oil-producing nation , " says Lawrence Goldstein , executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . " In the next few days we will find out what OPEC is made of . " Most oil-industry insiders believe , though , that the group will try to avoid cutting its price , at least by much . Their shared interest in keeping world petroleum prices stable will help resolve many disagreements . " They have held together in very troubled times , " says a Western petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will not see the collapse of OPEC and a wild price war . " <P> Taken alone , last week 's price cuts will have little impact on fuel prices in the U.S. But if they force OPEC to cut its benchmark Arab Light by about $1.50 , to $27.50 , gasoline prices in the U.S. could fall by about 30 per gal . Lower energy prices would spark more economic growth . But a fall in oil revenue would aggravate the problems of such countries as Mexico and Venezuela , which depend largely on oil income to pay their enormous foreign debts . Their trouble could extend to the dozens of U.S. banks that hold Latin American loans . <P> The economic impact last week in Britain was sharp and swift . The $1.35-per-bbl. price cut will diminish the government 's $13 billion annual oil revenues by about 5% . On the day of the announcement , the British pound fell to a record low of $1.19 . Shaken by the skidding currency and a possible worsening of the country 's coal miners ' strike , traders on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index to its steepest one-day loss in history .
