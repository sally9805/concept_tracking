Despite a debate over floating currencies , the Big Seven vow cooperation <P> With its picket fences , modest cottages and colonial-era ambience , Williamsburg , Va. , could hardly offer a greater contrast to the regal grandeur and formality of Louis XIV 's palace at Versailles . The heads of government from the Big Seven industrial nations are hoping that the outcome of their ninth annual economic summit , to be held in Williamsburg at the end of this month , will be equally different . Last year 's summit in Versailles degenerated into bitter wrangling over East-West trade , and the leaders are desperately anxious to avoid a replay . <P> So when ministers from the Big Seven and 17 other non-Communist countries gathered in Paris last week for a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , the spirit of harmony was carefully nurtured . The delegates issued a joint communique outlining general principles for fostering growth that could form a blueprint for a Williamsburg accord . <P> Nonetheless , profound disagreements remain , most notably on how to deal with gyrating currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech at the Elysee Palace , French President Franois Mitterrand , whose government has been shaken for two years by the falling franc , argued for an overhaul of the international monetary system to bring about more stable exchange rates . Nothing so ambitious has been tried since 1944 , when representatives of 44 nations met in Bretton Woods , N.H. , and established a worldwide system of fixed exchange rates that endured for nearly 30 years ( see box ) .

The U.S. , in particular , remains a staunch opponent of systematic intervention in exchange markets . <P> Said Treasury Secretary Donald Regan : " I do n't think we 're ready for Bretton Woods II . It 'll take quite a bit of discussion and arranging . It 's years away . " <P> On other issues , the ministers achieved compromise and consensus . For the first time in a decade , they agreed that inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in the face of stubbornly high unemployment rates , to make growth their top priority . To help revive international commerce , the OECD nations pledged to " dismantle " trade barriers and government subsidies that have shielded weak industries from foreign competition . <P> Unlike last year at Versailles , U.S. officials did not push the Europeans to curb trade with the Soviet Union . The U.S. case for such sanctions was weakened last week by a new report from the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment . It concluded that U.S. embargoes designed to punish the Soviets for their actions in Afghanistan and Poland had no major effect on the Soviet economy . With that in mind , the Americans settled for a vague statement that urged Western nations not to give " preferential treatment " to trade with the East bloc .
