In his campaign to become only the second Republican Governor of Florida in this century , Candidate Bob Martinez offered a medley of the G.O.P. 's greatest hits , highlighted by such familiar classics as slashing the budget and cutting taxes . Floridians loved his tune and rewarded him with a resounding victory over his Democratic rival , Steve Pajcic , last November . Today , however , Governor Martinez is singing the fiscal-responsibility blues . The man who vowed to " sweat $800 million " out of the state 's budget has instead proposed tax hikes totaling $850 million , the largest revenue increase in Florida 's history . <P> Martinez ruefully attributes his reversal to the " shock of reality . " Florida is the nation 's fastest-growing state and the sixth most populous in America ( 11.6 million residents ) . Yet it ranks last in per capita spending on human services and 47th in state and local taxes as a proportion of income . " The 895 new people per day who arrive in Florida to stay use water , waste water , need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faced with a constitutional ban on a state income tax and stringent limits on property taxes , Martinez did not have a wealth of options for raising funds . He turned to the state 's 5% sales tax on goods . Rather than increasing the levy , he expanded its reach to include services ranging from advertising to warehousing . " About 80% of our economy is service driven and growing , " explains the Governor . " With a sales tax on commodities , you 're taxing only 20% of the economy . " <P> Democrat Sam Bell , chairman of Florida 's house appropriations committee , called Martinez 's flip-flop an " irony of major proportions . " The Governor , who switched from the Democratic Party to the G.O.P. in 1983 , became the butt of pointed quips . " They said if I voted for Steve Pajcic , taxes would go up , " said wags . " Well , I voted for Steve Pajcic , and taxes are going up . " <P> Yet the tax hike won bipartisan support in the Democratic-controlled legislature . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill got the cold shoulder from legislators . The lawyers ' lobby won exemptions on fees of $750 or less for advisory services on an array of cases , including divorce and child-custody suits , but still planned to bring suit against the tax . The threat did not intimidate Dempsey Barron , chairman of the Florida senate rules committee , who called attorneys " the greediest , most soulless , heartless , blood-sucking bunch of people I $ have ever been associated with . " <P> Last week the state senate and house approved the tax hike . By breaking his campaign promise , Martinez has won plaudits from Democratic legislators and grudging respect from Republicans , who are relieved he never uttered those dreaded words income tax . But Martinez wants to make sure this monster increase will be his last . " I am prepared to take an unpleasant dose of tax medicine this year , " said the Governor , " but I do not intend to do it year after year because we did not do it right the first time .
