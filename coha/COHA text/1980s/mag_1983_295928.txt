AFTER LONG SILENCE by Michael Straight Norton ; 351 pages ; $17.50 <P> Upstairs in the nursery , little Michael Straight plays with his fire engine . Below , in his family 's Fifth Avenue town house , a guest , Joseph Conrad , reads from one of his novels . In this tortured memoir , Straight , 66 , wonders what work the author recited . He rather hopes it was Under Western Eyes , the story of Razumov , a young man who betrays an older student and loses his soul in the process . <P> From time to time , Conrad 's name is loudly dropped in order to underline the supposed resemblance between Razumov and Straight . But there are more pertinent names , among them Guy Burgess , Donald Maclean and Sir Anthony Blunt . Straight , the son of wealthy Americans , meets most of them at Cambridge , where , smitten by brilliant , romantic chatter about revolution , he joins a small Communist cell . Back in the U.S. , he signs on at the State Department , slipping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping out of espionage and politics to write novels and occasional magazine pieces . One afternoon in 1963 , Straight makes a full confession to the FBI . The revelation leads to the exposure of Blunt , although he is not publicly unmasked for more than a decade . When Sir Anthony meets the finger man he says blandly , " We always wondered how long it would be before you turned us in . " <P> The spies apparently never took Straight very seriously , and it is equally difficult for the reader to grant the author much moral stature . Straight 's belated mea culpa has the character of an afterthought : treason had long since been done . Through this self-dramatizing reminiscence , another book of Conrad 's suggests itself . A profound pity the author did not learn from Lord Jim , with its irrefutable observation : " Vanity plays lurid tricks with our memory .

So does Robert Greenfield 's Temple , but the author 's energy is so abundant that the entire genre seems revitalized . The protagonist , Paulie Bindle , is a Harvard Square dropout who quits a bookstore job to journey back to his Jewish roots in New York . Those roots no longer run deep . The women of the community find more solace at Toni 's beauty salon than they do at the synagogue , where the rabbi spreads false rumors of an Arab attack on Israel so that the congregation will give larger donations . A tape machine secretly records the pledges so that promises will be kept . The vulgarities of the temple 's Las Vegas Night , of gossip and conflict are mercilessly observed by Paulie , who overhears everything and forgives nothing . More affected by the songs of James Brown than the sermons of the rabbi , Paulie ends his quest at a church , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haunted by an ethos he can neither take nor leave .
