A mustachioed little clown with an undersize jacket and oversize trousers to symbolize IBM 's first computer aimed at the mass market ? That hardly fits IBM 's stuffy old image , but when the company needed an advertising campaign for its new personal computer 2 years ago , it turned to one of the 20th century 's most enduring and endearing characters : Charlie Chaplin 's Tramp . Says Charles Pankenier , director of communications for the PC : " We were dealing with a whole new audience that never thought of IBM as a part of their lives . " Industry insiders estimate that the firm has spent $36 million in one of the largest ad campaigns ever mounted for a personal computer . <P> Manufacturers of personal computers have been using readily recognizable people for some time to make the slightly intimidating machines seem warmer and more empathetic . Apple has Dick Cavett for its commercials , Texas Instruments recruited Bill Cosby , Commodore has William Shatner , and Atari just hired Alan Alda . None of these living celebrities , however , has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three widely seen television commercials , plus more than 20 print ads . He has won numerous advertising-industry awards . <P> Chaplin once explained that he created the character in 1915 , after an accidental meeting with a hobo in San Francisco . The Tramp 's resurrection was only slightly less serendipitous . IBM 's advertising agency , the Madison Avenue firm Lord , Geller , Federico , Einstein , was looking for someone , or something , that would attack the problem of computer fright head on . The agency was talking about using the Muppets or Marcel Marceau , the mime , when , according to Creative Director Thomas Mabley , the idea for the Tramp " sort of walked in and sat down . " <P> Some officials at both the company and the agency were afraid that the floppy character was not in keeping with IBM 's starched white-collar image . The question of whether the Tramp represented antitechnology sentiment , as epitomized in the most famous scene from one of Chaplin 's best-known movies , Modern Times , was also raised . In the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory . But both the agency and IBM eventually concluded that the character , in Pankenier 's words , " stands fear of technology on its head and would help the PC open up a new technological world for the non-technician . " <P> The company obtained rights from Bubbles , the Chaplin family company that licenses use of the actor 's image , to use the Tramp . To cast the part , the agency interviewed some 40 candidates in New York City and 20 on the West Coast . The winner was 5-ft. 6-in . Billy Scudder , 43 , who has been doing Tramp impersonations since 1971 . Says he : " Nobody tires of the little Tramp . He creates instant sympathy . " <P> The commercials are elaborate Madison Avenue extravaganzas . In one 60-second spot , which symbolizes the problems of inventory control in a small business , the Tramp stands at the intersection of two assembly lines in a bakery . He comes a cropper when the fast-moving line spews cakes onto the floor after he tries to jam a giant-size one into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer cakes .
