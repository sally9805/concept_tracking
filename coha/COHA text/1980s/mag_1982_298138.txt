Jaruzelski eases up on martial law , but not much <P> The rumor made its way around Poland with accelerating speed : to mark National Day , the anniversary of the founding of the Polish People 's Republic on July 22 , 1944 , the military government of General Wojciech Jaruzelski would ease the state of martial law that has been in effect since December . In an address to the Sejm ( parliament ) that was broadcast over nationwide radio on the eve of the holiday , Jaruzelski appeared to be doing just that . He announced that " most of the internees will be released , including all of the women . " The government followed up by promising to free 1,227 detainees and announcing that Poles who received invitations from relatives or professional groups abroad would be allowed to leave the country . The government also lifted curbs on travel in border areas and on telephone calls to foreign countries . <P> But Jaruzelski 's measures fell far short of satisfying most Poles . He did not mention Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Jaruzelski said the governing military council hoped to end martial law " before the end of the year , " he added that the Sejm would first have to grant the Council of Ministers unspecified " special powers . " It did not take long for Poles to see for themselves that little had changed . Before dawn on National Day , security forces destroyed a cross of evergreens and flowers that had been placed in Warsaw 's Victory Square to honor Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski , the Polish Primate who died last year . It was the fourth time that the authorities had swept away the cross . Later in the day , as special honor guards marched past the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Victory Square , squads of the ZOMO security forces , who have frequently been used to break up demonstrations , waited in the side streets with their riot gear and water cannons . Said a middle-aged steelworker : " How can you believe in the government 's good intentions when you have to have a celebration at gunpoint ? " <P> Equally disappointing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solidarity before the independent trade union was suspended last year , was Deputy Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski 's address to the Sejm . Rakowski claimed that a majority of the workers who had been in contact with the government favored a new structure in which unions would be organized by industries rather than by regions . Solidarity supporters disputed Rakowski 's statement , seeing it as an attempt to weaken the independent trade-union movement . Said a 30-year-old skilled worker from Warsaw : " Maybe Communist Party members want such unions , but the people want unions of the Solidarity type . "
