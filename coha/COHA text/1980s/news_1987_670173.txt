MARKHAM , Ontario  --  There are bigger companies than Magna International Inc. in the $99 billion-a-year U.S. auto parts industry , but probably none as eclectic . The company makes 6 , 000 car parts , from glove boxes to catalytic converters , and while most parts makers tend to specialize , Magna has grown rapidly by broadening its product line . There ' s " probably not anybody with as broad a range of different kinds of parts , " says Vernon Oechsle , a group vice president with Toledo , Ohio-based Dana Corp. , an axle and frame maker . Such diversity , Magna reckons , gives it an edge in what could be a new era in the parts industry , the age of modules . Modules  --  or systems , as some call them  --  combine lots of little parts into bigger ones . Instead of selling door handles to auto makers , Magna wants to sell them fully made doors . Beginning in 1989 , Magna says it will supply ready-made seats to General Motors Corp. ' s plant at North Tarrytown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontario . About 100 GM employees and more than 200 Chrysler workers currently put together seats at these plants from cushions , metal frames and a half-dozen other parts . " Between 1988 and 1992 you ' ll see a big slug of the business being modularized , " predicts James McAlpine , Magna ' s executive vice president and chief financial officer . Magna expects that modules  --  from fully assembled doors to cooling systems  --  will account for as much as 30% of its sales in 1990 . Last year Magna says modules accounted for less than 10% of the company ' s 1. 03 billion Canadian dollars ( $778. 7 million ) in sales , which were up 49% from the year earlier . Many parts makers see the advent of modules as a logical outgrowth of automobile makers ' efforts to cut costs and farm out a bigger share of their engineering and manufacturing operations . " All suppliers are working towards it . It ' s certainly the way of the future , " says a spokesman for Allied-Signal Inc. , a supplier of brake systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car makers are wary of discussing modules because their unions fear the trend . Neither GM nor Chrysler would confirm the seat contracts with Magna , though Chrysler acknowledges it will purchase seats from an outside supplier at some point after this summer ' s contract talks are concluded . The chairman of Canadian Auto Workers Local 444 at Chrysler ' s Windsor plant says the purchase of Magna ' s seats would " probably be a strike issue . " Nevertheless , Steven Roberts , Ford Motor Co. ' s director of supply policy and planning , says of modularization that " its time is going to come . " Ford currently buys parts from about 2 , 100 suppliers ; GM buys from about 7 , 500 . With modularization , Mr. Roberts says , the whole process of assembling cars will be made simpler . He says Ford recently contracted to buy fully made seats , which it traditionally assembled inhouse from parts . He says Ford engineers are studying the feasibility of using modular doors , instrument panels and " front corners , " which combine several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long purchased certain pre-assembled components from companies that specialize in certain products , including transmissions from Borg-Warner Corp. , axles from Dana or brakes from Bendix Corp. , now part of Allied-Signal . These companies mostly view the trend to modules as one that could help them extend their traditional expertise in these parts . Dana , for instance , says it agreed last fall to supply Mack Trucks Inc. with chassis assemblies that incorporate Dana ' s front and rear axles , drive shafts and suspensions . Magna takes a different tack than other companies in pursuing contracts for products it hasn ' t made previously . The company formed a joint venture in 1984 with a French maker of aluminum radiators to win a contract to supply American Motors Corp. with pre-assembled cooling systems . That same year it formed an alliance with West Germany ' s W. Grammer AG to get the know-how to make seats for GM and Chrysler . Magna has formed other joint ventures to make parts it hasn ' t made before , such as sunroofs and aluminum wheels .

" They ( Magna ) are manufacturing everything they can get their hands on , " says Charles Harris , an auto parts analyst with Valueline Inc . , New York . " It ' s contrary to everything that ' s been done in automotive . " Some analysts wonder if Magna hasn ' t overextended itself financially in its hurry to enter the big leagues . " They ' ve had massive capital expenditures at a time when the ( automotive ) industry is past its cyclical peak , " says Roland Jones , an analyst at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc . , Toronto . Magna reflects the skills and philosophy of Frank Stronach , its chairman , chief executive officer and controlling shareholder . Mr. Stronach , 54 years old , trained as a tool and die maker in his native Austria and emigrated to Canada in 1954 with less than $300 in his pocket . Three years later he opened a tool and die shop , where he sometimes slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s business grew steadily and in 1969 he merged it with a small aerospace and defense contractor to form Magna . He set up additional small factories instead of expanding the original plants . With usually no more than 200 employees , the factories proved impossible to unionize . The cost advantage of nonunion labor was helped by the falling Canadian dollar , which currently is valued at about 75. 5 U.S. cents . The company incurs most of its costs in Canada and sells most of its products in the U.S. Magna also gave its plant managers unusual autonomy and tied their pay closely to profits . The company currently has 97 factories . " They ' re like 100 small companies rather than one big one , " says Dennis DesRosiers , president of DesRosiers Automotive Research Inc. , a Toronto consulting firm . But David Race , president and chief executive of Toronto-based CAE Industries Ltd. , which also makes auto parts , says the " secret " behind Magna ' s early growth was its ability " to design the machines that stamp out the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every plant so they could bid on more kinds of products . Today , Mr. Stronach says he has 1 , 300 tool and die makers on the payroll " one of the largest skilled labor pools in North America . " Magna ' s sales have soared eighteenfold in the past decade . A share of Magna stock issued at 4. 05 dollars in 1971 is currently valued at about 360 dollars after splits and stock dividends , Magna says . The company looks to modules to help continue its momentum , and Mr. McAlpine , Magna ' s chief financial officer , says he expects sales to reach two billion dollars by 1990 . The price Magna is paying to fuel the rapid growth is what concerns analysts like Merrill Lynch ' s Mr. Jones . In the year ending July 31 , Magna says it will have spent 315 million dollars on new plants and equipment , bringing capital outlays since 1984 to 901 million dollars . Magna concedes that the frantic pace of capital investment is partly to blame for its depressed earnings so far this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months ended Apr. 30 were down 5. 9% from the year-earlier period . Magna ' s long-term debt at the end of the latest period rose to 386. 6 million dollars from 97. 4 million dollars two years earlier . The price of Magna shares had fallen to 25. 875 dollars , up 12. 5 cents , at yesterday ' s close on the Toronto Stock Exchange , from a 52-week high of 33. 125 dollars . But Mr. McAlpine says the debt isn ' t a problem because the company has sizable real estate holdings that can be converted into cash , and it has opportunities to raise additional capital by spinning off divisions . Two divisions recently were combined into Cosma International Inc. with the intent of soon taking it public . Magna is so confident about the modular-assembly trend that it recently opened a new 150 million-dollar plant capable of stamping out entire vehicle bodies . Magna believes the new Karmax , Ontario , plant , which will supply body panels to AMC ' s new midsized Premier model , will bring it a big step closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hottinger , a former Magna senior executive who is now vice chairman of Cosma , operator of the Karmax plant , says Magna plans to seek contracts to assemble specialty vehicles with short production runs of 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 units . That ' s carrying the module concept a bit too far to suit Ann Knight , an auto analyst with PaineWebber Inc . , New York . " The last thing the world needs is another car assembler , " she says .
