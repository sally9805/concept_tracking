The search for the yacht went badly . Neither the Navy nor the Customs Service could find what the White House was looking for . The President 's men had their eye briefly on John Wayne 's old converted minesweeper , but the price was $2 million ; the President had been sort of hoping that someone would , well , just donate a boat , accepting the nation 's thanks and the tax deduction . No one volunteered , so , for now , the White House has given up trying to find a presidential yacht on which Ronald and Nancy Reagan can float down the Potomac on summer evenings , dancing with friends or lobbying Congressmen . <P> The problem would never have come up , of course , if Jimmy Carter had not sold the Sequoia in one of his paroxysms of anti-imperial budget cutting . Carter got only $286,000 for the old yacht that had served American Presidents since Hoover , but it was the symbolism of the thing that mattered . Carter took the oath of office in a $175 business suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Pennsylvania Avenue on foot . He went for an image of blameless frugality , a presidency in a cardigan sweater : no pomp , just folks . He even brought his relative Hugh Carter ( " Cousin Cheap " ) all the way from Georgia to crack down on White House extravagances such as office TV sets and IBM Selectric typewriters . <P> Ronald Reagan practices a fancier personal style altogether . He spent $1,250 for an Inaugural morning suit ( the whole elaborately striped works ) . As soon as he and Nancy got to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , they began investing the place with a swank and shine it has not had since early Camelot , restoring many of the touches that the minimalist Carter had banned . They put the trumpeters back on the White House balcony to welcome foreign visitors . They fully reinstated Ruffles and Flourishes and Hail to the Chief . They stationed a Marine in dress uniform at the entrance to the West Lobby , just to salute decoratively and open the door . They spent $736,000 ( all privately donated ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become a little tacky . Nancy Reagan wears expensively elegant designer clothes ( " American thoroughbred , " Women 's Wear Daily calls her look ) and sets a handsome table of French dishes and the best California wines . Her Los Angeles hairdresser , Julius Bengtsson , flies in at least once a month to maintain the " highlights " in her hair . <P> The Carters had their own graces . But the contrast between their style and the Reagans ' revives a question that was first raised in 1789 , when Congress tried to decide whether the new President , George Washington , should be called " Your Highness . " The question : In just what sort of style do Americans want to keep their Presidents ?
