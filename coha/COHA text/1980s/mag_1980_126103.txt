After Michigan routed Stanford 49-0 in 1902 to win the first Rose Bowl , Tournament of Roses promoters had to wait 14 years before finding another West Coast team willing to take on an Eastern opponent . There were other events during the hiatus  --  chariot racing , bronco-busting , egg-and-spoon racing  --  but no football game until unbeaten Washington State accepted the challenge in 1916. // That season 's champ from the East , Syracuse ( 9-1-2 ) , was invited to face State , but the Orangemen , who had already taken a three-game swing through the West that season , declined . Despite a mediocre record ( 5-3-1 ) by bowl standards , Brown was the second choice . The game 's promoters had been impressed with the Bruins ' late-season wins over Yale and Carlisle and with their star halfback , Fritz Pollard , who the following year would become the first black running back to make Walter Camp 's All-America team . For Brown , this first and only appearance in a postseason game would n't be an experience it would want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longest any college team had taken to play a single football game . They had reservations at a hotel in Pasadena , but upon their arrival , the desk clerk announced that the hotel had space for everyone except Pollard . This was n't the first time the team had encountered such prejudice . On the train coming out , Pollard had n't been allowed to sit with his teammates in the dining car . At the hotel , Assistant Coach Bill Sprackling demanded to see the manager . When the clerk refused , Sprackling pounded on the desk bell and shouted , " If there is n't a room for Fritz Pollard , none of us wants one . " The manager appeared , and Pollard got a room . // Two days before the game , the team was taken on a sightseeing trip that included a tour of an ostrich farm that bordered an orange grove . According to Jay Barry , author of a forthcoming biography of Pollard , " Most of the players were from the East and had never seen oranges on trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the price with a bad case of diarrhea. " // Meanwhile , Washington State was having a grand time acting as if it were an Ivy League team . Before leaving Pullman , Coach Bill ( Lone Star ) Dietz arranged for his players to work as extras in the movie Brown of Harvard . Years later , Dick Hanley , a halfback on the team , would recall , " For two weeks before the game we were busy all day filming the football scenes . We thus combined our movie work with training for the game , and Lone Star , a real dandy , who carried a cane and wore a silk hat and spats when he coached , got a part as one of the principals in the picture . We made about $100 apiece and bet it all on ourselves to beat Brown . " // On the morning of the game , the Bruins were the guests of honor at the Tournament of Roses parade , which featured the first bathing beauties ever to appear in the pageant . " They wore black bloomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is now 86 and living in New Rochelle , N.Y . " They were the only ones dressed for the weather . " Two nights before , snow had fallen in Pasadena for the first time in 16 years . Things had warmed up by game time , but it was still precipitating . The rain that day would make the ' 16 Rose Bowl one of only three that have been played in wet weather . // " We 'd all left our rain cleats back in Providence , " says Pollard . " Who 'd need them in sunny California , we 'd figured . The shorter dry-weather cleats allowed me to move faster and got me going sooner , but Lord , they 'd be an anchor in the mud ! " // At 2:15 p.m . Washington State kicked off through a wall of water that had turned the playing surface into a quagmire . Pollard fielded the kick and was still trying to get a toehold in the mud when he was tackled . " By the time we 'd run our first four plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Pollard . " We were covered from head to toe with California . " // Because Pollard was improperly shod , it hardly mattered that the Cougars were keying on him . " Heck , I 'd go down sometimes without them even laying a finger on me , " he says . Brown Quarterback Clair Purdy did his best to exploit the opposition 's concentration on Pollard by decoying Fritz around end while he and Halfback Harold ( Buzz ) Andrews probed the middle . The ploy worked for a while . Late in the second quarter the Bruins reached the Washington State four but came away empty-handed . // About five minutes into the third period , with the score still 0-0 , Pollard left the game choking on mud and water . After regaining his breath , he repeatedly pleaded with Coach Edward North Robinson to put him back in . Robinson refused , explaining that without rain cleats and exhausted from his efforts during the first half , Pollard could hardly improve on his replacement , Irving Fraser . Pollard later learned how memorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I met Walt Disney while playing in the pros , " he says . " He told me he was at the game , and the sight of me jumping up and down from the bench had never left his mind . Years later he used the scene in a Mickey Mouse cartoon . It 's the one in which Mickey 's team plays these big lions , and Mickey keeps popping up from the bench and says , ' Put me in , please , Coach , put me in. ' " // Besides being a premier runner , Pollard was one of the nation 's most heralded defensive backs . For most of the game he played the right side , so as soon as he was benched , the Cougars stepped up their assault on that flank of the Brown defense . The result was a three-yard scoring run by Halfback R.R. Boone. // But even while Pollard had been playing , Washington State had been operating on the notion that the right side of the Bruin defense was n't as strong as the left . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested to some Cougar players that 6 ' 3 " , 225-pound Right Tackle Mark Farnum was the weak link of the defense . The humor was lost on the Cougars , who ran right at Farnum all day . " He took such a battering that after the game he was covered from neck to feet in blood , " says Barry . " And because the blood had coagulated all over his body , he had to have his canvas uniform cut off . " // Late in the fourth quarter , after State had scored again , a sympathetic locker-room man dug up an old pair of shoes fitted with rain cleats and took them out to the Brown bench . " They were way too big , but I strapped them on any which way , " says Pollard . " I knew we could n't change the outcome , but I wanted to show them what might have happened if things had been different . " // On the final play of the game Purdy called a reverse with Fritz carrying . His oversized cleats spraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gave him 47 on the day , the lowest output of his college career . // Although Brown never scored  --  the game ended in a 14-0 Washington State victory  --  Pollard thinks that the reverse , along with the Bruins ' determination in adversity , convinced the Tournament of Roses promoters to make the game an annual event . " The crowd loved the action , " he says , " and the publicity we generated convinced the promoters there was money to be made in an annual East-West game . " // The day also provided Pollard with a personal lesson . From then on , through another season of college ball and eight as a pro , he carried two pairs of cleats  --  one for dry turf , one for mud .
