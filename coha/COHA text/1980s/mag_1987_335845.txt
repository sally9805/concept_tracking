When Waylon Nickell and Donald Seek of King County , Wash. , went scavenging for aluminum cans in a ravine south of Seattle late last month , they found much &; more than they had bargained for . Nestled amid the weeds and debris near the bottom of the slope was a human skull . The next day police uncovered the remains of Cindy Anne Smith , a 17-year-old King County woman who had been missing for more than three years . The grisly discovery brought to 37 the number of young women murdered in a series of slayings that has baffled police since July 15 , 1982 , when the first body was pulled from the county 's Green River . After five years , the killer is still the object of one of the biggest and most frustrating manhunts in the country . <P> All the murders are believed to be the work of a single suspect , quickly dubbed the " Green River Killer , " who appears to have ended his monstrous spree in March 1984 . Over 20 months , the killer may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local women remain missing and are presumed dead by his hand . By contrast , John Wayne Gacy , convicted in 1980 of more murders than anyone else in U.S. history , was found guilty of killing 33 boys and young men . <P> Even though the Green River killings seem to have ended , police are unsure whether the murderer is dead , has moved elsewhere or is just lying low . Indeed , despite the use of the most modern techniques , thwarted investigators know very little about this killer except that his primary targets are young prostitutes and that his lethal attacks may involve a repertory of strangulation , bludgeoning and sexual assault . <P> The hunt for the Green River Killer has pulled together police resources from throughout the Seattle area , but to little avail . A task force that currently includes 19 detectives , two FBI agents and a computer expert has already spent some $10 million and investigated 1,300 suspects . Yet an additional 6,000 names await full checking , a process that can take anywhere from an hour to six months . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of most of the victims . Many had few family ties ; many were last seen alive hustling on the Sea-Tac strip , a three-mile stretch near the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport . Cindy Anne Smith , for example , was , according to authorities , a runaway at 13 who sometimes supported herself as a topless dancer . Another victim , 15-year-old Carrie Ann Rois , was a streetwalker for three months before she disappeared in May 1983 . <P> Some of the victims were never reported missing , and others were dead and buried for more than two years before police uncovered their remains . The result is less normal police work than what Lieut . Dan Nolan , a police task- force commander , calls forensic archaeology . Investigators have made computerized topographical maps of sites where a body was discovered , combed each area with tweezers , and sifted through tons of dirt for bits of evidence as tiny as a fingernail . The police have even scanned bird nests on the off chance that they might contain a telltale stray fiber.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
