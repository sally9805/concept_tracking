With a dramatic display of poise and defense in the final minutes of a hard-fought contest , the Nets rallied from a 90-83 deficit for a stirring 101- 98 victory in the fifth and deciding game of the first-round series before a sellout crowd of 17 , 921 at the Spectrum. // With the loss , the 76ers , who swept through the playoffs in unprecedented fashion last season , become the 15th consecutive team to fail to retain its title , dating back to the Boston Celtics , who won championships in 1968 and 1969 . Last year , Philadelphia won 12-of-13 games on the way to the crown . This season , the 76ers lost all three of their home games to a team that had not won a playoff game in its previous seven seasons in the league. // " It still hasn ' t sunk in yet , " said Bobby Jones , the 76er forward . " Maybe it will when we see the Nets playing in the series on TV . We could have been there.

The Bucks eliminated the Atlanta Hawks tonight. // The Nets won the game just when they weren ' t supposed to , in the final minutes - a time when teams with their youth and inexperience are supposed to unravel and leave the victories to the more seasoned. // Indeed , they won it after the 76ers took a 90-83 lead , with just 7 : 12 remaining , when the point guard Maurice Cheeks , playing with pains in his knees , back and head from the first 3 games of the series , stole a pass from the Nets ' guard Micheal Ray Richardson and raced to the other end of the floor for a lay-in . It was the 76ers ' biggest lead of the evening. // Then , Buck Williams of the Nets , whose pitiful free-throw shooting contrasts sharply with his wondrous play on the floor , hit two shots from the line . That started a 9-2 Net surge that was highlighted by a 3-point play by Richardson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birdsong and raced up the floor . As he neared the basket , he was hounded by Mark Iavaroni , a bruising forward . And as he left the floor , he was pummelled . But the ball rolled into the rim , and Richardson hit the free throw to tie the score at 92 with 4 : 43 left in the season - for one of the teams. // " I could feel him coming so I took it in all the way , " Richardson later said . " When it went in I knew we were on our way. " // Moses Malone , the 76ers ' force in the middle who had taken charge in the second half by grabbing 11 of his 14 rebounds , then missed a jumper . And Iavoroni fouled Darryl Dawkins as both went for the loose ball. // Dawkins , getting in early trouble , played only 12 minutes in the first 3 periods and finished with only 4 points . But he hit the two free-throws to give the Nets the lead , 94-92. // Julius Erving , who finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead with 2 straight jump shots. // But the Nets answered with 4 points of their own on a drive by Richardson and two free-throws by Albert King , who had stolen the ball from Erving before being fouled by Malone. // With that the 76ers would not score another meaningful point . Misses by Malone and Erving resulted in a fast- break basket by King , who had 10 of his 15 points in the final period. // And after misses by Cheeks and Erving , Richardson hit the final free throw that ended the champion ' s reign. // Andrew Toney scored a lay-in as the Nets streamed onto the floor in celebration. // " These guys may be young and naive , but they don ' t fear anything , " said Birdsong , who atoned for poor performances in Games 3 and 4 by tying Richardson for game-high scoring honors with 24 . " Winning was a tremendous accomplishment for us. " // For Williams , perhaps the most valuable player in this series , it was a night to remember . " I can ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were so many who contributed . It ' s just wonderful. " // Williams scored 17 points and had a game-high 16 rebounds. // For the former champions , the feeling was as sour as it was sweet for the Nets . Less than an hour after the game , many of them paced about the Spectrum floor with their arms around each other , attempting to offer consolation. // ' This is typical of the up-and-down season we had , " said Erving . " I expected it to be a struggle . We forced them to play our kind of game and they responded to the challenge. " // " If they play the next series like they played at times in this one , they could go very deep , " said 76ers coach Billy Cunningham . " I just hope they don ' t feel their season is complete by beating the World Champions.
