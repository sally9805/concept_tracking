" The Age of Caravaggio , " the Metropolitan Museum of Art 's big show this winter , may come to be remembered as a marker in the history of exhibitions . Not even the Met , this time , could get the loan of his greatest work . Owners and curators are getting more conservative , especially in Italy , and the days when uniquely important works of art could be flown around the world like greeting cards , even for scholarly purposes , are fading . <P> In 1951 , when the Italian scholar Roberto Longhi mounted the crucial show that brought Caravaggio 's turbulent genius out of three centuries of neglect and obloquy , this was not a problem . But 34 years later , thanks to the enthusiasm generated by Longhi , more people probably go to , say , the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome to worship Caravaggio than to worship God . <P> There are splendid things in the Met 's show : nobody could say that rooms holding Caravaggio 's Uffizi Bacchus or the London Supper at Emmaus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Met has done some good to scholarship by setting Caravaggio against what was painted in Italy , and especially in Rome , when he was alive . Other exhibitions have focused on how the artist influenced 17th century painting all over Europe . This one shows the painting that influenced him when he was growing up  --  and the visual pedantry he had to contend with . Except for Lotto , Tintoretto and Bassano , and some beautiful works by Annibale Carracci , Adam Elsheimer and Guido Reni , most of this is deadwood and of interest mainly to specialists . Moreover , the climactic efforts of Caravaggio 's career , like the Beheading of St. John the Baptist in Malta ( which must be the most sublimely concrete work of the tragic imagination painted between the death of Michelangelo and the maturity of Rembrandt ) , are not here . So it is best to treat the Met 's show as a preparation for pilgrimage and to ignore the blatant copies , pastiches and restored wrecks , such as The Magdalen in Ecstasy , The Toothpuller and The Martyrdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately padded . <P> Today , Caravaggio almost ranks with Rembrandt and Velasquez as the most popular of all 17th century artists . Mythmaking has something to do with this . We have a proto-Marxist Caravaggio , the painter of common people with dirty feet and ragged sleeves . There is also a homosexual Caravaggio , moved into the spotlight during the ' 70s by gay liberation : the painter of overripe , peachy bits of rough trade , with yearning mouths and hair like black ice cream . Most of all , there is Caravaggio the avant-gardist.
