The spirit of adventure is alive and well <P> There is a priggish voice inside most of us that complains , on hearing about someone like Geoffrey Tabin , " Where would we be if everyone jumped off bridges on long rubber bungee cords ? " Bobbing boozily up and down , yoing , yoing , yoing , that is where we would be . Ca n't have that ; no one ever got any aluminum siding sold or orthodontia bills paid while dangling from a bungee cord . And Tabin , a Harvard medical student , admits that an alcohol-fueled , top-hat-and-tails leap off of Colorado 's 1,053-ft. - high Royal Gorge bridge in 1980 required " no skill , just a little stupidity and a fairly calculated risk . " <P> Thus it is gratifying to learn that Tabin , 27 , who carried off his stunt with several other members of something called the Oxford Dangerous Sports Club , has moved on to more mature concerns . He is in fact a member of an American mountaineering expedition in Tibet that intends to make an ascent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George Leigh Mallory , the great British climber who died on Everest while making a summit attempt in 1924 , had written of the East Face that " other men , less wise , might attempt this way if they would , but , emphatically , it was not for us . " Tabin , tracked down with his colleagues in China last week , said , " The most difficult and scary part is explaining to a Jewish grandmother that you 're taking time off from medical school to do it . " He also said that he would like to make love on top of Everest but had no realistic hope of doing so . <P> Tabin and Teammate George Lowe , 38 , tried to climb the East Face in 1981 and failed . They are , of course , expert mountaineers , who know the formidable dangers they confront . But this seriousness presents a problem in comprehension for citizens who like to think of themselves as solid . Everest 's weather is as foul and unpredictable as any in the world , the avalanches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick off climbers every expedition or so , and the deadly thin air toward its 29,028-ft. summit debilitates and stupefies the mountaineers it does not sicken or cripple . What craziness is this to be serious about ? <P> There have always been adventurers , footloose and sometimes screwloose , and their careless " Why not ? " has always stirred alarming and delicious fears in settled souls whose timid question is " Why ? " But Dr. Livingstone has been found ( alive on the shore of Lake Tanganyika , in 1871 , by Anglo-American Journalist Henry Morton Stanley ) , the Atlantic has been flown in a single-engine aircraft ( by Lindbergh , in 1927 ) , the polar regions have been explored ( by an assortment of frauds and heroes ) , the world has been circumnavigated singlehanded ( first by Joshua Slocum from 1895 to 1898 ) , and all of the 14 mountains higher than 8,000 meters ( 26,400 ft. ) have been climbed . Space is there to be rummaged , but not , at least in this century , by lonely daredevils .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
