In 1960 , Clarence Dickson , the first black to graduate from the Miami police academy , proudly stood for a picture of the class in which he ranked third out of 16 . A few days later , while Dickson was out on patrol , the class reassembled and a new , all-white " official " picture was taken without him . Last month the Miami police department held another solemn ceremony from which Dickson , 50 , could not be excluded . For he was being installed as Miami 's chief of police , the first black to hold that job in the racially troubled city . <P> In 1964 in New Orleans , Warren Woodfork was working as a postal clerk when he accompanied a friend to police headquarters for a recruitment test . " As a kid , " said Woodfork , who grew up in the city 's housing projects , " I never had a desire to be a policeman . " But on an impulse he took the test , got the job , " and fell in love with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the first black police superintendent of New Orleans . <P> Dickson and Woodfork thus joined a growing group of blacks across the country who have reached the pinnacle of law enforcement . The police chiefs of four of the nation 's six largest cities  --  New York , Chicago , Houston and Detroit  --  are now black , as are twelve of the top police officials in the 50 largest cities . The eight-year-old National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives now numbers some 60 police chiefs , directors of public safety and sheriffs among its 700 regular members . Ten years ago , there was only one black chief in a large city , Hubert Williams , police director of Newark , N.J. Last week Williams was named the new president of the Police Foundation , the influential law-enforcement think tank in Washington . <P> The new chiefs ' credentials are impressive : they have either spent decades struggling up through the ranks or combined street experience with a lot of college credits ( at least four are Ph.D.s ) . Nonetheless , politics was often what put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities where they serve have at least a 25% black population , and the appointment of a black has commonly been seen as a concession to the minority community , one that is , of course , standard in U.S. urban history . But the new appointees are no guarantee against continued turmoil . Dickson is Miami 's third chief in the past year . " If I only last a week more , " he says , " I 'll be happy knowing that I reached the top . "
