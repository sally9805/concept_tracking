The Somers sank in a sudden gale on Dec. 8 , 1846 , while on assigned blockade duty off Veracruz during the Mexican war with the United States . The unpopularity of that war and the subsequent massive loss of land incurred by Mexico make the ship ' s ownership and protection a thorny issue. // The US claims sovereign ownership , but Mexico has noted that it could be considered war booty , since it was a warship . The US has countered that it sank in a storm , not from wartime activity. // // ' ' Were the wreck in US waters , ' ' says James Delgado , chief maritime historian with the US National Park Service , ' ' it most probably would be listed as a National Historical Landmark. ' ' // Last November , the US State Department requested that Mexico protect the wreck , but no official action on the part of the Mexican government has resulted . According to George Belcher , who led the expedition that located the Somers , this is one of the rare times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986 , Mr. Belcher , an art dealer and deep-sea diver , his brother Joel , and magnetometry expert Daniel Kosti-Karell located the wreck in 107 feet of water five miles off the coast of Veracruz. // The wreck is an archaeologist ' s dream : an important historical ship lying undisturbed - in disarray , but intact. // ' ' It ' s the closest thing to a storybook shipwreck I have seen , ' ' said Mitchell Marken , the team ' s underwater archaeologist . ' ' The whole structure is there. ' ' // ' ' The Somers is believed to be the best and one of the only shipwrecks found of its historical period . . . the 1840s , ' ' says Mr. Delgado. // The thorough documentation and rich history of the ship make its discovery especially valuable. // Delgado verified that at least six of the ship ' s 10 cannons were visible , along with one anchor and artifacts such as crystal glasses and wine bottles. // In a briefing March 16 to the State Department , the US Navy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed the urgency of acting quickly to keep the fragile site safe from bounty hunters. // ' ' It is so significant , not only historically , but archaeologically , that the US Somers deserves our utmost protection , ' ' Delgado says. // But then , the Somers is no ordinary ship. // ' ' Our discovery of the US Somers has revived a story of mutiny , hangings , ghosts , courts-martial , and cover-ups , ' ' says Belcher , who lives in San Francisco. // On its maiden voyage , in 1842 , the Somers was the scene of the only mutiny in the history of the US Navy. // Begun by 18-year-old Philip Spencer , son of then-Secretary of War John Canfield Spencer , the incident was actually an attempted mutiny that failed . The captain had Spencer and two cohorts hanged after a ' ' drumhead ' ' court-martial was conducted at sea by the officers and captain. // Evidently a strict disciplinarian , Capt . Alexander Slidell Mackenzie had numerous floggings administered on board the overcrowded training vessel - three-quarters of the crew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutiny was quelled after the hanging of Spencer , Boatswain ' s Mate Samuel Cromwell , and Seaman Elijah Small. // The event not only stirred controversy among the American public , but also convinced sailors , a traditionally superstitious lot , that the ship was cursed and haunted by the ghosts of the three hanged men . The Somers was thereafter avoided by sailors whenever possible. // Captain Mackenzie , meanwhile , was tried by a Navy court-martial on five charges , including murder , but was eventually acquitted of all of them. // Public debate raged on , however , with the most vociferous opponent of Mackenzie ' s innocence being James Fenimore Cooper , who publicly accused the captain of murder. // The Somers affair even became part of American literature when Herman Melville heard of the proceedings from his cousin , Guert Gansevoort , the ship ' s second in command . Melville became fascinated with the incident and based his novella ' ' Billy Budd ' ' on the Somers mutiny. // One positive footnote to the unfortunate incident : After the dismal failure of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a land-based training facility and established the US Naval Academy in Annapolis , Md. // According to Belcher , the Somers mutiny became such an embarrassment to the Navy that 19th-century naval eti-quette dictated that officers should never discuss the matter. // Discovery of the ship was kept secret until last November to give the State Department , the Navy , and the Mexican government time to jointly protect the site. // These precautions , however , may be in vain if the Mexican government continues to delay its decision . Belcher says he knows of one Mexican diver who has located the site and has been bringing up some artifacts. // The only way to protect the site , should it be declared a monument , would be constant patrol by the Mexican Navy , Delgado says. // If it were declared a historical monument , some of the steps that would be taken , according to Delgado , involve nondestructive documentation of the wreck , detailed maps , drawings , and a careful archaeological display that would reflect the multinational heritage of the Somers and its significance to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public through media presentations and literature. // ' ' There is not much down there in terms of treasure , ' ' says Belcher , ' ' but the historical significance is really important. ' ' // According to Delgado , the Somers Discovery Project may be the only privately funded expedition he has seen whose goal is history , not bounty. // ' ' The Somers story , her dark past , and tales of ghosts are the jewels of this find , ' ' Mr. Marken adds. // His group is working on a documentary film whose anticipated sales may begin to offset the approximately $85 , 000 already invested by the partnership. // //
