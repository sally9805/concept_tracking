The struggling Herald American will keep going - as a tabloid <P> The front-page announcement was brief : " Good morning . You 'll be getting a new newspaper Sunday . " Thus the Boston Herald American ( circ. 209,128 and falling ) last week ended speculation that it was about to fold . Despite heavy pressure from the bulging Boston Globe ( circ. 502,920 ) , the Herald American is optimistically pushing on . Says Publisher James Dorris : " We 're giving the people of Boston and New England something they want , a compact , easy-reading , lively newspaper for the ' 80s . " <P> Translation : the Hearst-owned daily had run out of options . The Herald American was formed in 1972 when Hearst 's racy Boston tabloid , the Record American , absorbed the city 's staid , 125-year-old blue-blood bible , the Herald Traveler . The new paper never caught on . Combining the mismatched styles of the papers it subsumed , the Herald American alienated former readers of both by , for example , running weighty political analysis side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first 371,664 , fell steadily ; losses are now estimated to be $10 million a year . The Globe commands more than two-thirds of the city 's daily newspaper readership and three-quarters of its advertising . Indeed , in recent months the entire Sunday Herald American was often outweighed by the Globe 's classified ad section alone . <P> Hearst 's return to the tabloid format is a desperate , but plausible , effort to survive . The tabloid style , first practiced successfully in the U.S. by the New York Daily News ( founded in 1919 ) and currently being carried to its irrational extreme by the New York Post under Rupert Murdoch , was modeled on Fleet Street 's screaming dailies . The main features : short , punchy stories , heavy illustration , emphasis on sex , crime and gossip , and a smaller size for the harried , hurried commuter . <P> The form has matured , and among the two dozen or so surviving U.S. daily tabloids are some solid journalistic entries .

In Chicago , the Sun-Times ( circ. 661 , 531 ) is known for investigative reporting : last week it broke the Cardinal Cody story .

Near by , the 106-year-old Delaware County Times converted itself last June 15 from a 25 afternoon broadsheet ( circ. 39,000 ) to a 10 morning tabloid . In just ten weeks , circulation has risen to 49,000 and advertising linage has increased an estimated 10 over last year .
