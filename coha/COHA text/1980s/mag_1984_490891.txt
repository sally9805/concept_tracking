Notes and Comment AFRIEND writes : Now that the President has assured us that the economy is looking up , my wife and I have been thinking about buying a new motor vehicle . What else can you get these days , after all , for under ten grand that may last a couple of years ? So we 've been watching the automobile , van , and light-truck ads on television with special intensity . Trouble is , they have n't been showing us much that seems suitable to our needs . Few of the shiny bargains we scrutinize behave like ordinary cars . They 're forever being driven across a riverbed or a desert or a ski slope , or they 're soaring through the air like Evel Knievel , or standing on their heads , or lying on their backs . As soon as some company comes up with a model that keeps its wheels on the ground and travels , as we generally do , on roads , we 'll probably rush right over to its nearest dealer and ask for a demonstration spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven days a week . " Now , more than ever , I realize that I do n't have much time , " he said when we called on him at his house  --  a modest one in St. John 's Wood , in London  --  shortly before his seventy-fifth birthday . He is assembling a new edition of his collected poems ; preparing a hook that is based on his translation of Sophocles ' three Oedipus plays , staged in Cambridge last year ; and working on his memoirs . " I 'd like to reduce the book reviews and journalism , " he said , " but I always seem on the point of having two articles to write before I can get around to writing poetry . " Yet Spender appeared happy to be working steadily ; pleased to be living by his pen instead of off his name . Wearing an open-throated blue shirt and a brown sweater , he looked casually elegant . His blue eyes shone softly beneath the familiar shock of silver hair . Even today , he could probably be recognized from Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over half a. century ago , when he and Isherwood and W. H. Auden became friends : " He burst in upon us , blushing , sniggering loudly , contriving to trip over the edge of the carpet  --  an immensely tall , shambling boy of nineteen , with a great scarlet poppy-face , wild frizzy hair , and eyes the violent colour of bluebells . " Between the two great wars , Auden , Isherwood , and Spender , together with Louis MacNeice and C. Day Lewis , influenced an entire generation of poets and other writers . Spender , in particular , remains a symbol of the effort to balance art and political engagement  --  a struggle that continues for many writers in the Western world , who are seeking to demonstrate in print against the nuclear-arms race . His turning point was the Spanish Civil War . In Spain , he spent some time at the front , but his poetry was concerned more with the horrors of war than with its politics . " No poet of my generation wanted to be political , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we also saw that the threat was to our literature . Later , Auden tried to remove anything political from his poems , but I never tried to edit out my past , even when my past stuck- to me . I 've had funny experi ences with immigration officers in New York because of my left-wing affiliations and the Spanish Civil War . The first time , when I came to the States to teach at Sarah Lawrence , I was questioned about my passport by an immigration officer and got a pleasant shock . ' Are you Stephen Spender the poet ? ' he asked . I confessed that I was , and he let me through . Another time , I carried an old passport , and the immigration officer said there was something wrong with it  --  something arcane from my past . There were two little dots on the passport , indicating some sort of radical affiliation . Then the officer surprised me . He asked , ' Do you know Auden ? ' I said that I did , so he admitted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the writer in wartime . " Auden thought that writers had no influence on politics , but that was nonsense , " Spender said . He fetched two wineglasses , set them down , filled them , and went on , " Shakespeare , Goethe , and Dante all influenced ideas and events . By deciding to write in the vernacular , Dante helped to achieve Italian unification . The same could be said about Goethe in Germany . It was Shakespeare 's language that created the political inspiration to resist the Nazis during the Battle of Britain . Even though these writers were not political figures , their words counted . Do n't you think that writers like Tolstoy and Brecht gave shape to events ? Brecht was always trying to align himself with Stalin , because of his own anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi views , but he was basically concerned with human aspirations , and that is why his work endures . " Spender served in the London fire service during the Second World War . Later , he wrote that London acquired " a regal dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Epilogue to a Human Drama , " celebrated that time : London burned with unsentimental dignity Of resigned kingship : those stores and Churches Which had glittered century-long in dusty gold Stood near the throne of domed St Paul 's Like courtiers round the Royal sainted martyr . At the end of the war , Spender volunteered to serve in the British-occupied zone of Germany . He knew Berlin well , having observed it in the company of Isherwood during the early nineteen-thirties . " After the war ended , I was responsible for reopening the libraries and at the same time deNazifying them , " he said . " I remember one librarian who worked with me summing up my work in her own words : ' I must take all the hooks by Nazis off the shelves and put them in the cellars , Herr Spender , and bring up from the cellars all the books by Jews and put them on the shelves . ' It was a fairly accurate job description . " Spender is still involved in the concerns of writers and their freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is serving as a director and on the editorial hoard of Index on Censorship , a bimonthly , published in Great Britain , that is partly subsidized by the British Arts Council and by the Fund for Free Expression , in New York . He was one of its founders , in 1972 , and had earlier enlisted the support of friends , among them Auden , Henry Moore , Bertrand Russell , and Igor Stravinsky , to help get the magazine off the ground . Every issue contains a country-by-country survey of censored writers and banned books in the East , the West , and the Third World . No nation is immune from exposure , he pointed out . A recent issue reported abuses by the Reagan Administration , including the withholding of historical documents " under stringent new declassification rules . " He helped to raise money for the magazine by giving poetry readings in the United States last year . Although Spender takes no direct part in political affairs , he is very much aware of the trends in his own country and elsewhere . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do what they are doing on armaments , " he said . " Politics is too closely caught in the net of physical power today  --  as in the Falklands , where Mrs. Thatcher had to go out and defend them . Power may run contrary to the interests of ordinary people , and it can result in national paranoia . Toward each other , America and Russia display a hysterical paranoia . " Since many British authors and journalists support the activities of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament FEBRUARY 27,1984 and the remarkable group of women demonstrating season after season against the missile base at Greenham Common , we asked Spender if their actions engaged his support . " I am not a participant in the work of the C.N.D. , " he said . " It appears to be old-style proletarian . I wish the writers in it would grapple with other things as well as with nuclear disaster  --  for example , attack poverty wherever it exists . The C.N.D. has a negative view  --  against the arms buildup  --  but it ought also to he concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with anti-poverty programs generally . I 'm sure the members hold those views as well , but it is not their main expression . I 'm glad that the C.N.D. exists  --  it would be a scandal if it did not  --  but such actions need participation by both sides . As long as the Russians have their terrific military arms , I do n't think the demonstrations will have a real effect . " As Spender stood up , we noticed a drawing of him by Henry Moore on a wall . He explained that it was made in the nineteen-twenties for a magazine to illustrate some of his poems , when both he and Moore were at the beginning of their careers . " In any event , I could not help C.N.D. by joining them , " he said . " I 'm too much associated with the views of fifty years ago . As I get older , life comes to he like fiction : one sees terrible things happening to people one knows , to old friends . But I have no complaints . Auden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain . I have been very lucky . I am still earning my keep , making a living by writing . Touch wood . " Fleeting WE could swear we saw him . Or it . There in Regine 's , next to the brand-new , 1984 Cabbage Patch dolls , and the new Cabbage Patch pets , and the Cabbage Patch sports outfits , and the piles of shrimp , and the indoor/outdoor plastic table with the Cabbage Patch umbrella , under the TV lights , bumping shoulders with the tuxedoed waiters serving vodka tonics in Cabbage Patch plastic cups and with the Coleco Industries executives talking bottom line . A spectre . A spectre haunting the preview of the 1984 Cabbage Patch plans . A spectre so dim it was easy to miss him ( or it ) , a cunning shade changing shape like a late-twentieth-century Proteus . Sometimes he was hard and round , like  --  like a pet rock . Sometimes he was soft and pliable goo encased in a plastic oval , and all you could think of was Silly Putty . Sometimes  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unmistakable aspect of a hula hoop . Once , he put on wire-rimmed glasses , and then he was a dead ringer for John Denver . It was n't a spectre you could grapple with , like international Communism or budget-busting deficits . It needed first to be understood , and so , beginning right there at Regine 's , we launched a bipartisan inquiry . At the height of the Cabbage Patch drama last fall , you may recall , moms and dads behaved inappropriately , and sometimes even acted out , while attempting to buy the cuddly kids . We took this subject up with the Coleco president , Arnold C. Greenberg , who put on his serious face and said , " As upsetting as the occasional riot was , and as upsetting as the occasional consumer injury was , we found that people were able to separate that out from the positive feeling they had for the dolls . The dolls came through the riots very well . " So well , in fact , that Coleco began its 1984 preview with a film of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dolls , has continued to propel sales in the post-Christmas era , a Coleco vice-president , Alfred Kahn , told us . " Because no two dolls are alike , there is infinite demand , " he said . " Demand is still so strong that they 're gobbling up every one we produce . As you know , each doll comes with its own name and adoption papers ; we have a staff of people who sit in Southern courthouses and go through birth registries in search of fresh names . " As the Cabbage Patch population multiplies , new applications arise , a Coleco publicity woman , Barbara Wruck , said . " I 'm in receipt of a number of communications that show that the dolls are being used in a party context . One lady wrote in to say that she had given a party for about thirty little girls and their dolls , and that ? ? instead of Pin the Tail on the Donkey they had played Put the Pacifier in the Mouth of the Cabbage Patch Kid . And it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are enjoying dolls , as opposed to action figures . Little boys can relate to the dolls in terms of their own maleness and toddlerness , and they have a vehicle for their emotions of love . The Cabbage Patch Kids have broken down all the traditional barriers . " Barbara showed us the most interesting addition to the Cabbage Patch line . " Many owners wrote in to say that their Cabbage Patch Kids wanted dolls to play with , so we have these miniature Cabbage Patch Kids . They have a Velcro strip on the back , so they can attach to the original Cabbage Patch dolls . We think they 'll be very popular . " ? THAT same day , we found ourself in some acreage bordering on the main Cabbage Patch , this time courtesy of another company ( Parker Brothers ) , at a different ritzy joint ( the Helmsley Palace ) , where they were serving new delicacies ( squab ) , and where attention was focussed not so muchon the dolls themselves as on the release of a long-playing album recorded by New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabbage Patch Dreams " marks Parker Brothers ' entry into the children's-record market , and it also starts the unfolding of the Cabbage Patch saga , which will continue in subsequent record releases and in a number of books due out in April . " We 're now really the keepers of the story , " a company executive , Bruce Jones , said . " In the magic valley , the bunny bees sprinkle crystals on the cabbage plants , and that 's where the kids come from . It 's sort of a biological oddity . We want stories for kids , not kiddie stories . And we want records and books that adults can stand , because they buy them . " Over spinach salad ( we 'd hoped for coleslaw ) , John Keller , who is the Parker Brothers editorial director , explained to us how he was producing the Cabbage Patch books . " The old way is to give authors their head , " he said . " We , on the other hand , make up a list of , say , thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have people who go into su- permarkets and stop shoppers in the aisles , and if they are potential buyers of children 's books they are asked to rank the thirty plots in order of interest to their children . Once I have the rankings , I call up my pool of authors and give them a plot to work with , and a style sheet explaining the characters  --  Otis Lee is a small , hairless boy , for instance . And then I say , ' Please write twenty-five hundred words filled with verve and excitement . ' " Speaking of verve and excitement , Tom and Stephen Chapin and three children picked that moment to begin belting out some of the tunes on the new album , which include " Cabbage Patch Theme , " " Cabbage Patch Dreams , " and " Cabbage Patch Parade . " " When we started to work on the record , " Tom said afterward , " our first decision was to make it a story , not just a collection of ten songs . There 's nothing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it gives kids a reason to turn the record over . And to buy the second album , and the third . " Generator SOAP operas , commercials , specials , documentaries , and other such items made in New York City for television , movies made for movie houses , and live theatre , ballet , concerts , and assorted other performing arts  --  now including musical videos  --  are worth two billion dollars to the city each year . This impressive fact , based on a Port Authority study of economic development which was issued last May , was given to us the other day by Patricia Reed Scott , the director of the Mayor 's Office of Film , Theatre , and Broadcasting . " The performing arts are a major generator of dollars in the city 's economy , " Miss Scott said , delivering the line with the authority of someone who knows firsthand whereof she speaks , and someone who is clearly determined to be a very active participant in the generation of dollars . Here are some highlights of Miss Scott 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portsmouth , Virginia , and raised in Southern California ; was a child actress on a San Francisco radio station ( Little Beaver in the radio version of the " Red Ryder " comic strip ) ; graduated from George Washington University , in Washington , D.C. ( English-lit major ) ; married the actor George C. Scott and did summer stock with him in Canada ; came to New York in the fall of 1956 and lived at 44 Riverside Drive , in an old apartment where , myth had it , John Barrymore had once lived ; had two children , who are now in their twenties and are involved in different aspects of the performing arts ; started the Studio Duplicating Service ( scripts of all kinds ) and sold it ; acted Off Broadway ( " I enjoyed it , and was good at it , as a matter of fact , but I was never driven " ) ; worked in night clubs like the Blue Angel , Bon Soir , Mister Kelly 's , and Troubador , as a singer , in tandem with Woody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a press agent , a business agent , and a record contract and then freed herself from all of them ; went to work under Mayor John Lindsay as a press officer in the Department for the Aging ; produced a television series about aging called " Getting On , " which won a couple of Emmys ; worked for three years as a deputy press secretary for Mayor Koch ; was appointed eight months ago to her present job . She is blond-haired , slightly buxom , good-natured , sharp-eyed , quick to anticipate questions , able to give well-informed answers , and acquainted to some degree or other with thousands of actors , producers , directors , promoters , developers , archivists , and benefactors of the entertainment industries , and also with politicians and strategically placed friends who like what she is trying to do for film , theatre , and broadcasting around here and want to help her do it . " I did n't perceive the breadth of the activity until I read the Port Authority 's description of all the components of the performing arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea at the Algonquin . " The permits issued by our office in 1983 numbered six thousand two hundred and sixty-four for filming on locations , mainly exterior , around the city . That 's six hundred and twenty-seven more than in 1982 . Films made entirely in New York numbered thirty-three , but that many again were partly made here . These productions , which brought eight hundred and fifty-six million dollars to the city , included ' Trading Places , ' with Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd ; ' Romancing the Stone , ' with Michael Douglas ; Not for Publication , ' with Nancy Allen and Laurence Luckenbill ; ' UnFEBRUARY 27,1984 faithfully Yours , ' with Dudley Moore and Natassja Kinski ; ' The Cotton Club , ' with Richard Gere ; ' Le Bon Plaisir , ' with Catherine Deneuve ; The Brother Who Fell to Earth , ' with Joe Morton and Dee Dee Bridgewater ; ' Sweet Ginger Brown , ' with Matt Dillon and Richard Crenna ; Ghost Busters , ' with Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray ; ' Staying Alive , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Martin Balsam and Judd Hirsch ; ' The Lonely Guy , ' with Steve Martin ; ' Broadway Danny Rose , ' with Woody Allen and Mia Farrow ; Moscow on the Hudson , ' with Robin Williams ; ' The Ultimate Solution of Grace Quigley , ' with Katharine Hepburn and Nick Nolte ; ' Once Upon a Time in America , ' with Robert De Niro ; ' Splash , ' with John Candy ; and The Muppets Take Manhattan , ' with Miss Piggy and Kermit . " In television , we 've got nine soaps , which we call daytime dramas , being produced here , and those bring in two hundred million dollars a year . We 've got five one-hours ? All My Children , ' Another World , ' As the World Turns , ' The Guiding Light , ' and ' One Life to Live ' ? and four half-hours , which are ' The Edge of Night , ' ' Ryan 's Hope , ' Search for Tomorrow , ' and our newest one , Loving . ' Each soap gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers , stage managers , gaffers , grips , electricians , camera people , script supervisors , makeup artists , audio technicians , wardrobe people , editors , and others  --  I have lists of them . What with the soaps and the theatre and commercials , we have a great acting pool . There is n't a better acting pool in the world . " Miss Scott took a sip of her tea . " I have constant reminders of the opportunity picture for actors , " she told us , with a wry smile . " For instance , seventy-five per cent of all major characters in prime-time television are men , mostly white and mostly between the ages of thirty-five and fifty-five . And the women are mostly white and are mostly between twenty and thirty . " Miss Scott continued , " We 've made progress on all fronts . Five years ago , we had the following made here : forty feature films , thirty-nine movies or specials for television , three hundred and seventy-five television programs , nine hundred and sixty-one commercials , four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student films . Last year , we had anywhere from fifty THE NEW YORKER to a hundred per cent more activity going on . Over the past eight years , we 've made steady progress in the restoration of the old Astoria Studios , among the biggest in the world , with the largest soundstage  --  twenty-six thousand square feet . The whole complex is on a twelve-acre site , with fifteen buildings and eight soundstages -- with two of the soundstages opening this month . You probably know that over a hundred silent films were made in the Astoria Studios in the nineteen-twenties . The Marx Brothers , Rudolph Valentino , Clara Bow , W. C. Fields , Gary Cooper , and Claudette Colbert all made movies here before they went out to Hollywood . When Hollywood moans and groans about what it calls ' runaway productions , ' I always say , What do you mean , runaway ? It all started here . ' " " flow do you encourage filmmakers and others to come here ? " we asked . " We 've got a great staff in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We do n't charge for our services . Other cities charge , but we 're here to serve . Two of my people have been production managers , and they really know the business . We have four people issuing permits , including a former Parks Department man , Sam Stone , who knows every rock , every tree , every bush in the parks . Four others are experts on television , the theatre , film operations , and film development . Benefits to the city often go way beyond the actual production . For example , ' The Verdict ' used the stairwell of the Tweed courthouse , behind City Hall , as a location . The movie people cleaned and painted the stairwell until it was sparkling , and , of course , that 's the way it was left for us . Once a year , I go out to California and see the production heads : Charlie Maguire at Paramount , Fred Gallo at Warner Brothers , Terry Nelson at Universal  --  all of them . They know what New York looks like . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they tell me what they need , I tell them what we 've got . We have wilderness on Staten Island that is as good as anything out West . If it 's caves they want , we 've got caves aplenty in Inwood . As a matter of fact , one young filmmaker just finished Luggage of the Gods , ' set in the time of Neanderthal man , and he used our Inwood caves for the film . The Perry Coma Special ' Christmas in New York ' came here because its people wanted scenes with a fifth-grade class at the United Nations International School and the Neapolitan Christmas tree at the Metropolitan Museum of Art . We offer extraordinary sets . " Miss Scott went on , " The commercial theatre is also our concern . This city has the best performing live stages in the world , and we 're out to help build an audience for the theatre . Early Stages is our program to bring thousands of schoolchildren to see preview performances of shows . Last fall , we bused in eleven hundred kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each of the thirty-two school districts  --  to see The Tap Dance Kid , ' and it was such a success that we 're getting tenthousand-dollar contributions from theatre-related people to do the same thing for other new shows . Audiences talking their heads off at the theatre drive me crazy . That 's the influence of television  --  talking at home no matter what 's on the screen . We 're going to build a theatregoing audience that keeps quiet . " We asked Miss Scott to give us an example of one of her successes in bringing a film production to New York . " A producer came to see me the other day , " she said quickly . " Ile said he represented a big , big star . He wanted to know about production costs , and I told him that fringe benefits are cheaper here than in California . Then he said suppose he wanted to hire a fifteen-year-old actress  --  what about the rules regulating working hours ? I told him that our rules are less stringent than California 's . What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them at himI.A.T.S.E. ( that 's International Association of Theatrical Stagehands and Electricians ) , N.A.B.E.T. ( National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians ) , and the Teamsters , the Screen Actors Guild , the Directors Guild , the Writers Guild . And he was satisfied . He 's going to make his movie here , about a psychoanalyst and his fifteen-year-old patient , and the star is Frank Sinatra . I like to send people back to California as happy as possible . "
