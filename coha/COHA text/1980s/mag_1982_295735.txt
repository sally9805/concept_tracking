POLAND Low Hopes Martial law in all but name <P> For weeks Poland 's ruling junta has been dropping hints that it might lift martial law this week on the first anniversary of the military crackdown . But as Dec. 13 approached , the official propaganda machine began to sound a decidedly cautious note . Newspapers ran interviews with " average " Poles who expressed concern that it might be too soon to ease security measures . The government freed 32 imprisoned Solidarity activists from the Warsaw area , but suggested that many union leaders still behind bars ( an estimated 300 ) would stay there . A front-page headline in a Warsaw daily seemed to sum up the new official line : WE SHALL RETREAT FROM MARTIAL LAW BUT NOT FROM PUBLIC DISCIPLINE . <P> A special session of parliament , scheduled to begin deliberations this week , will have to decide what to do about martial law , but it looks as if General Wojciech Jaruzelski intends to lift it in name only . The government will still be able to imprison opponents without trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western diplomat : " The whole exercise is primarily for propaganda purposes , but I am not sure if it is intended more for the Polish people or for Western governments . " <P> The Warsaw regime has a vested interest in playing to a Western audience . Government officials estimate that Poland will need about $3 billion in new credits next year to revitalize the economy and meet its obligations on an estimated $25 billion debt to the West . So far , Warsaw 's show of reform has not persuaded Western governments to lift economic sanctions . <P> Angered at the continuing deadlock in relations with the U.S. , Jaruzelski delivered an unprecedented tirade against the Reagan Administration . The normally soft-spoken Polish leader railed against Washington 's " anti-Polish obsession " and warned that his government would curtail contacts with Americans . <P> While Jaruzelski raged , onetime Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa , who was released last month from detention , tried to keep out of the public eye . He has written to Jaruzelski , reportedly asking for permission to make a speech at a wreath-laying ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve years ago . Walesa will have to choose his words carefully , knowing that any criticism of the government might land him in detention again .
