The six-pound beauties were liorious , ! mum alums : triple cnoccnate , fig and honey ? as rich and runny as a Brie . She peddled them to Philadelphia restaurants under the name Mother Wonderful . And all of a sudden , the self-proclaimed Frog Princess was the Queen of Philadelphia Cream Cheese . Myra had baked . her way to fame and fortune . Success begets success and today , at 46 , Myra is not just a cheesecake baker extraordinaire but also a published writer . Her first book , " The Secret Life of Mother Wonderful " ( Beaufort Books ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mother , wife , and gourmet cook in urbia ? that steamy place where mothers compete with mousses and fresh sorbets . Where wives Kill with hollandaise , then lick the butter from their fingers to hide the evidence . The book is funny and clever , sometimes bittersweet , on-the-money true . It is written as though Chanin were the result of an unholy alliance between Julia Child and Henry Miller . WHAT A LONG WAY Chin &; has come . At 30 , she was not one of God 's chosen few . An only child , she was not even one of her mother 's chosen few . She had no job . - No prospects . She was a triple college dropout . Cousins were marrying doctors , reproducing , and opening charge accounts . Myra was living with a guy who had no intention of marrying her . " Why buy the cow if the . . " her mother reminded her daily . Enter Alvin . The Crown Prince . ( Myra : " A Crown Prince is a guy who has passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the refrigerator yelling Where 's the butter ?

Myra and Alvin marry and raise little Steven , a budding gourmet who finlicks on tett ' . The happy little nuclear family settles down in Phildelphia near the art museum , the one with all the steps where Rocky used to run every morning . This is fitting . Rocky and Myra are much alike . They are both determined . . . driven . Their eyes burn with unfulfilled passions . They know they were born to do great things in this world . It is just a question of what ? and when . Before she hits on cream cheese , Myra has false starts . There is a brief fling at nude modeling . Even though she describes herself as " plump , short .. . lumpy hips ... a girdle of fat where more fortunate women showed a waistline . . . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stills strips down to her freckles ( in her kitchen , in front of her messy countertops ) for photographer Becky Young , who does this sort of thing for a living . The photograph will hang in art galleries for all the world , and her mother 's friends , to Aft . Then there is a stint as a sales trainee in a sex shop , selling leather ready-to-wear , blindfolds , and whips to inhabitants of the city Of brotherly love . Finally , Myra turns to food . Or rather returns to food . It has always been there , a constant source of aggravation between her and her mother , Sonya . There is no amount Myra can consume that will ever satisfy her mother . " By the time I was 4 I looked like Humpty Dumpty tree-trunk thighs crease full skirts . Scalloped collars Accent my chins . Still not fat enough . Die Mama fills blintzahs with eggs and cream cheese for me and stuffs chicken necks with noodle pudding . She laces up her oxfords and trudges to an A &P; where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Sonya feeds me into frealthood . " Even today Myra yearns for a nice bout of anorexia nervosa , " the chic disease . " FOOD IS MYRA 'S life . It is a weapon : " When I care about Alvin I feed him fish and alfalfa sprouts . When I 'm angry at him , out comes the heavy cream ... " A source of power : " I am an oral fascist , I want to control the tastebuds of the world . " The ultimate rejection : " If Alvin says the melon is no good , I take it personally . Love me , love my fruit . " ? Myra gets caught up in the gourmet craze that sweeps the country . She plants a garden and " sits in my air-conditioned house to read ' The New York Times Book of Vegetable Gardening . ' " The puny fruits of her labor simmer into a fistful of ratatouille . " In September , I added up my bills and figured out how much the garden had cost to maintain . . . each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had swallowed was worth 97 cents , and each pepper had been equal in value to a small diamond chip . " Undaunted , Myra leaps forward in the pungent world of the gourmet cook . She finds herself locked in spoonto-spoon combat with her son 's best friend's-mother . Mrs. Porter makes homemade pasta with fresh clams and mocha torte when Steven sleeps over . Myra retaliates with zucchini souffle and carrot cake studded with brandy-soaked raisins . Mrs. Porter ups the ante with rack of lamb and homemade mango ice cream . Myra counters with quenelles , tempura , pate en croute . Only Craig Claiborne knows the heights the two would have reached had Myra not traded her whisk for a brand-new IBM Selectric to out-do Erma Bombed ( at // Phisdelplue Inqurrer plioloantune fylIbbb bY Catbl ?

But Myra sweetened the pot for prospective publishers : she sent a cheesecake along with her manuscripts , It worked . Chutzpah and talent almost always do . Which is why today Myra can say : " So here I am at 46 in my prime . . . It would have been impossible without the sometimes reluctant support of the Jewish Prince , who solved my financial problems when he walked down the aisle beside me . Do I tremble that Alvin will find some gorgeous mega-woman ... and say adieu to me ? It could happen , but I highly doubt it ... neither one of us is willing to give up our beautiful townhouse . " Success is sweet no matter when it comes sashaying into your life . No less juicy at 46 than 35 or even 20 . But still , it has its bittersweet side .
