By spending $160 billion a year on its huge purchases of sophisticated weapons and mundane supplies , the U.S. Defense Department has become the " largest and the most important business enterprise in the world , " declared a presidential commission that undertook to reform the Pentagon 's procurement procedures two years ago . It is also a system , said the commission , that is " fundamentally ill " in the way it awards 15 million contracts annually . Just how wrong things have gone at the Pentagon became apparent last week . Operation Ill Wind , an extensive two-year investigation of fraud and bribery in the handling of major purchases , blew into the open , rattling Washington and the nation 's military-industrial complex . <P> After being briefed on the probe , Republican Senator Charles Grassley predicted that it will reveal a " fraudulent use of taxpayers ' money beyond the wildest imagination . " Speaking into a committee microphone he thought was turned off , Republican Senator John Warner , a former Secretary of the Navy , confided that " rampant bribery in Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House Armed Services Committee , said he was " utterly astounded . " <P> The cries of alarm seemed justified . Sources close to the investigation , conducted jointly by the FBI and the Naval Investigative Service , predicted that at least 100 people will be indicted within the next 90 days . Among the suspects are past and present Pentagon officials , as well as industry employees and consultants who allegedly paid bribes for inside information that gave companies an unfair advantage in bidding for contracts . Two Democratic Congressmen or their staffs are also under scrutiny . Eventually , Operation Ill Wind may rank as one of the biggest federal white-collar crime cases ever prosecuted . <P> Although the Reagan Administration 's $2.2 trillion defense buildup has been plagued by cost overruns , phony bills from contractors and gold-plated weapons systems that often do not work , this scandal is different . Rarely , if ever , have such high-ranking Pentagon officials been suspected of graft on so large a scale . And while Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci maintained that the corruption concerned " individuals , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to show that the whole procurement process is a joke , " contended a high-ranking investigator . While not claiming that all transactions are fraudulent , he insisted that " there has n't been a significant contract let in the past six or eight years that has n't been made on the basis of inside information . " <P> For Carlucci , who has been lobbying with a reluctant Congress to sustain the defense buildup , the scandal will make his task more difficult . Nor will it help Vice President George Bush , whose campaign for the Oval Office has already been saddled with the Iran-contra affair , implications of widespread impropriety among Reagan appointees and the investigation of Attorney General Edwin Meese . The Vice President could be further embarrassed by his close association with former Navy Secretary John Lehman . One of the principal targets of the investigation is former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research , Engineering and Systems Melvyn Paisley . He and an associate , retired Admiral James ( " Ace " ) Lyons , who had commanded the Pacific Fleet , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagon .
