A SOLDIER 'S PLAY by Charles Fuller <P> The light is all but gone . One can barely make out the drunken , lurching figure in the center of the stage . " They still hate you ! " he howls in a voice of blistered gravel . " They still hate you ! " Two rifle shots ring out as if to verify his charge , and the man falls dead . <P> This is the opening scene of A Soldier 's Play , which inaugurates the Negro Ensemble Company 's 15th season . It is a drama of tensile strength that almost deflects attention from its flaws . The dead man is Technical Sergeant Vernon C. Waters ( Adolph Caesar ) , a regular Army , " all Army " noncom who fought in World War I. The time is 1944 ; the place Fort Neal , La . Apart from its white officers , this is a black outfit consigned to menial and , sometimes , degrading tasks . <P> The first surprise for Commanding Officer Charles Taylor ( Peter Friedman ) , a West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown ) , the black officer assigned by the Army to investigate Waters ' murder . Almost inadvertently , he says to Davenport : " Being in charge does not look right on Negroes . " Besides , the prime suspects are local stalwarts of the Ku Klux Klan . What Deep South white man would testify before a black ? Davenport is a seasoned skirmisher on the color line . He is adamant , but scrupulously fairminded . <P> What follows is a kind of courtroom trial in which Davenport interrogates everyone and reconstructs the crime in flashback . The flashback is a tell-and-show device . It can be used with fluid emotional mastery , as Arthur Miller used it in Death of a Salesman ; here it seems more like a dry studied exercise on a schoolroom blackboard . <P> More interesting than the whodunit part of Fuller 's play is the " Who the hell was he ? " aspect in which Waters ' complex character is explored . Waters has tried to scour himself to whiteness through discipline and excellence . He is a martinet who addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one guitar-strumming vagabond singer , sweetly played by Larry Riley , to his death . " They ought to work you niggers till your legs fall off , " he screams at his charges , meaning " snap to and measure up , " the one-line basic English catechism of the U.S. regular Army sergeant . Waters does not hate his men . He simply , heartrendingly , knows that a black may snap to , and yet never measure up , in a white man 's universe . <P> In taut , forceful direction , Douglas Turner Ward elicits splendid performances from his cast . Adolph Caesar 's portrayal of Waters merits an acting medal of honor . - By T.E . Kalem
