Howard Baker went to work one morning last week with a Christmas necktie that was pink with large blue polka dots . Such extraordinary flamboyance for the White House chief of staff made even the President take notice . " I 'll give it to you if you 'll wear it , " said Baker , an offer that Reagan tactfully declined . <P> The disagreements between those two usually have been on more momentous affairs during their year together . But as they head into the President 's final months , Baker is more concerned that " our instincts are too much the same " than that Reagan sometimes goes against his advice . Abrasion is a part of creative politics . <P> History stalks the former Tennessee Senator , as astute a political philosopher as this city has seen . He watched the TV clip of Reagan saying , " The business that I used to be in said , ' Save something for the third act . ' And we will . " Once again , muses Baker , the President is right . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be lame ducks , " he says . " This is a different era than the last days of Dwight Eisenhower . Events are so swift and interrelated . Reagan amplifies that necessary involvement because he is such an assertive person . " <P> A year ago , Baker and the President worked out an understanding on objectives . Baker drew up a battle plan in Santa Barbara , which Reagan read and signed , one of those supersecret documents that archivists someday will exhume from the recesses of the presidential vaults . " In general , we pretty much did what we set out to do , " says Baker . <P> Now his staff is producing a similar blueprint for 1988 . There is even a small task force crafting Reagan 's farewell address for a year hence . <P> Politics will taint everything this year . But Reagan should be at least an equal act in the grand finale , an act that could produce the INF treaty ratification , a Moscow summit , a new Supreme Court Justice , a ringing budget and free-trade debate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirants hack away at one another . Reagan will stand aside for now . " In 1985 , when I got out of the Senate , " recalls Baker , " I came down to the White House to see the President and tell him I wanted to run for President . I asked him if he was going to try to pick his successor . He said , ' I do not intend to . ' Then I had a second question . If he changed his mind , would he let me know ? He said he would , and I have not heard a thing . " Baker has warned his staff not to slight any Republican or give any an advantage . He has tried to keep the White House scrupulously neutral in the feuds between George Bush and Bob Dole , much to Bush 's consternation . " I 'll end up with all of them mad at me , " he grins . <P> If the Reagan-Baker last-year plan succeeds , the President will go off into the history books looking remarkably like the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point , Baker tells a story . " By Tuesday afternoon of the summit with Gorbachev , we were all worn out , and , to be honest , it had not gone all that well . Gorbachev was spewing facts all over the floor . The President was down . ' Howard , ' he said , ' I had better hit the books tonight . ' ' No , ' I said , ' I would n't do that . Be Ronald Reagan . Remember who you are , what you believe and where you want to go . Let us take care of the facts . ' Wednesday morning the President took charge and never let go . "
