This is the year the federal government is supposed to do something about an enduring health-care scandal : The health- insurance salesmen who prey on the fears of the elderly . Older people know that Medicare does not pay for everything and that federal health insurance is being cut back . But they rarely know exactly what coverage they have . Taking advantage of their ignorance , unscrupulous salesmen sell them several overlapping policies , all of which can not be collected on . They may misrepresent the policies , or sell policies that will not cover the buyer ' s current ailments for one or two years after purchase . ( The waiting period for coverage of current ailments should be no longer than three to six months . ) Thanks to a bill passed by Congress in 1980 , the federal government is setting voluntary standards for old-age health insurance . The final rules should be published this months . Some states have even higher requirements . Starting in July , insurance policies that meet federal standards can be advertised as such . The hope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away from those that are unapproved . In the meantime , your best protecton is to know exactly what you get from Medicare , and what the supplemental policies can do for you . Medicare covers most of the hospital bill ( at semi-private room rates ) for people 65 and older . You pay the first $260 ; if your hospital stay is no longer than 60 days , Medicare pays the rest of your basic bill ( The average hospital stay for people 65 and older is only about 10 days . The average daily hospital bill , for room , board and a few basic services , is about $152 . ) In the unusual event that you are hospitalized for more than two months , you pay $65 a day during roughly the third month , and $130 a day during the fourth and fifth months . After that , you pay the bill in full . Payments for the fourth and fifth month can be used only once . If you are hospitalized for a second long illness , Medicare stops after the third month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a skilled-nursing facility , Medicare pays the basic charges for your first 20 days . You pay $32.50 a day for the next 80 days and all costs after that . Medicare also pays all reasonable charges for skilled health care that you receive at home under a doctor ' s supervision . Medicare also covers 80 percent of " reasonable " doctor bills , after a one- time deductible this year of $75 ( Medicare deductibles usually rise every year ) . If Medicare determines that $100 is a " reasonable " fee for a certain service , it will pay $80 , even if the doctor charged more than $100 . And doctors often do charge more than Medicare allows for . In general , there are three levels of supplemental private health insurance to consider : The minimum medigap coverage , which is usually the best buy for thedollar . Such policies cover your share of long hospital stays , nursing-home stays for up to about a year , and your 20 percent share of a doctor ' s " reasonable " fee . The American Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. 20049 ) sells this kind of coverage for $126 a year . Many Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans have competitive policies , as do a few private insurers . Comprehensive medigap insurance , which covers all of the above plus extras - your annual deductible , extensive private nursing care , prescription drugs , even doctor bills above the " reasonable " level . The price : $500 to $600 , or more . The average person will find it more cost-efficient , and more affordable , to keep a cash reserve for these extras rather than to insure them . Daily-income policies , which pay a set amount ( usually small ) for every day that you are in the hospital . In general , these policies deliver the least for every dollar spent . The AARP offers daily- income policies to holders of their medigap coverage , but there ' s no strong need to load one policy on top of the other . Note well : No matter what a salesman may imply , medigap policies to not cover nursing-home expenses for people in permanent need of daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pocket until you run through your resources ; after that , you may qualify for Medicaid.
