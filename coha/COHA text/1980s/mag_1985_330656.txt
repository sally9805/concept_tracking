To the thousands of demonstrators on the Ellipse south of the White House , the message was a high point in their struggle against abortion : an open endorsement from the President . " I feel a great sense of solidarity with all of you , " Ronald Reagan said in a telephone call broadcast to the crowd by loudspeakers . " Our response to the twelfth anniversary of Roe vs . Wade . . . must be to rededicate ourselves to ending the terrible national tragedy of abortion . . . I feel these days , as never before , the momentum is with us . " <P> His listeners were participating in the March for Life , held each Jan. 22 to mark the Supreme Court 's 1973 decision legalizing abortion . Some 70,000 people turned out , the largest number to date and double the size of last year 's rally . For the first time , the protest included acts of civil disobedience : 28 people were arrested for picketing without a permit on the steps of the Supreme Court . <P> The show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the movement . Recent months have seen a record number of bombings , as well as instances of arson and harassment , at abortion centers . Pro-choice supporters , fearing more of the same last week , organized protective vigils at some 30 clinics around the country . Reagan again disavowed antiabortion extremists , urging a " complete rejection of violence as a means of settling this issue . " His endorsement of the marchers was more qualified than it first seemed : a White House spokesman said Reagan still favored abortions when a mother 's life ! is threatened . In any event , the Administration is not expected to push the issue this year on Capitol Hill . <P> But activists on both sides of the abortion controversy think Reagan 's statements have created a momentum of their own . Said Ray Kranz , a South Dakota farmer who traveled to the march in Washington by bus : " Reagan has helped us out a lot . He 's been an inspiration .

" <P> The President also called attention to a just released antiabortion film , The Silent Scream , a startling 28-minute documentary that shows ultrasound images of a twelve-week-old fetus being aborted . Activists predict the film will become a high-technology Uncle Tom 's Cabin , arousing the public just as Harriet Beecher Stowe 's 1852 antislavery novel ignited the abolitionist movement . Declared Reagan : " It 's been said that if every member of Congress could see that film , they would move quickly to end the tragedy of abortion . " The producer , American Portrait Films of Anaheim , Calif. , plans to mail the movie to all 535 lawmakers and the nine Justices of the Supreme Court . <P> Portions of The Silent Scream aired on network news shows last week . " Never have so many millions of Americans seen such a graphic representation of a baby being ripped apart , " said Congressman Robert Dornan , an antiabortion Republican from California . " The other side is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Abortion Rights Action League : " I think we 're in for some hard times . "
