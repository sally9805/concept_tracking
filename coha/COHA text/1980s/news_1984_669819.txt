WASHINGTON  --  Interior Secretary William Clark is gradually but steadily backing away from parts of the controversial offshore oil and gas leasing plan he inherited from his predecessor , James Watt . In the face of congressional and state pressure , Mr. Clark is trying to keep the basic outline of the five-year program , while making significant procedural and policy changes calculated to deflect criticism . The new plan is consistent with signals that Mr. Clark wants to accelerate energy development but tone down the rhetoric and keep the department out of the political spotlight created by Mr. Watt , the agency ' s former chief . Interior Department officials described the plan as Mr. Clark ' s top priority . Officials said Mr. Clark , among other things , is considering reducing by as much as 50% the amount of offshore acreage to be offered in future lease sales . Recent top-level staff meetings also have focused on proposals to defer or cancel a few currently scheduled sales where state opposition is especially strong . At least two sales scheduled for leases off Alaska and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next two years may be formally postponed or scrapped . The Interior chief also appears to be leaning toward setting up joint federal-state leasing teams similar to those in the department ' s coal-leasing program to resolve environmental and other conflicts without litigation . Final details of the plan haven ' t been worked out , but agency and industry officials familiar with the discussions confirmed the tentative proposals . " It ' s more than a fine-tuning of the existing program , " said one senior oil company official . " The intention is to stick with the same concept but throw out those parts that have created the most problems . " State legal challenges and congressional action have blocked the department from proceeding with major parts of Mr. Watt ' s plan to make available for leasing as many as 200 million offshore acres each year . The policy changes also appear to reflect White House desires to play down partisan arguments over natural resources and improve the president ' s image as an advocate of environmental protection in an election year . In a briefing to members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief sketched out the intent of his policies . " We will continue to both refine and improve " the offshore-leasing program , Mr. Clark said , to reflect " what I think must be greater consultation with state government . " The secretary also acknowledged that parts of the current plan are " stalemated " and suggested the administration should " proceed on a perhaps more selective basis with this vital leasing program . " However , Mr. Clark didn ' t provide any specifics . According to officials , another tentative revision would make the government more selective about what areas it studies for potential leasing . The department would decide ahead of time which tracts probably aren ' t suitable because of low industry interest , pollution concerns , Defense Department operations or other reasons . Environmental impact studies would be focused primarily on suitable areas . Interior officials estimated the department last year actually offered for bids more than 119 million of the 200 million acres Mr. Watt originally planned . Of that amount , approximately seven million acres were leased . As part of the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors and , according to agency officials , indicated his willingness to compromise on some issues over which Mr. Watt and certain coastal states had collided in the past . Alaska Gov . Bill Sheffield , for instance , asked the department to delete a large number of the tracts scheduled to be offered for lease in June off the state ' s coast . The California governor ' s office is urging Interior officials to give states more time to comment on proposed lease sales . It isn ' t clear how far the Interior chief will go to try to meet such requests . Final decisions probably won ' t be made until Congress returns at the end of the month and Mr. Clark and White House officials assess the reaction to their preliminary proposals . Mr. Clark is expected to explain some of his plan in more detail tomorrow when he addresses a high-level federal advisory group for offshore leasing .
