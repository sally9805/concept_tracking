Playgoers who arrived early for a show at Britain ' s National Theater the other evening got an unusual added attraction : Twenty-six young American actors gave a reading , in the theater foyer , of poems they had written . They protested beforehand that they were actors , not poets , and by and large that was a correct assessment . Poetry magazines probably will not be competing with one another to publish their works . But the point of the exercise was dramatic , not literary . It was a demonstration of their ability to perform under pressure , and in that they succeeded , for the most part , remarkably well . " We were all terribly nervous , " said Mary O ' Neal , 32 , of Chicago . " We are used to reading other people ' s lines , not our own . " The poetry reading , arranged by poet and playwright Adrian Mitchell , was one of the final events of a crowded , often hectic three-week schedule for the Americans . They were a privileged group , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program at the theater that is tailored for Americans . The actors , who included four Chicagoans , put in 12- and 14-hour days six days each week . They went to classes nine hours a day , attended British theatrical productions in the evenings and took assignments home with them . They worked with 19 of the world ' s most renowned directors and actors , including Sir Peter Hall , the director of the National ; Peter Gill , who directs one of the theater ' s five acting companies ; and Anthony Hopkins , star of one of the National ' s most successful current productions , " Pravda . " " It was a marvelous experience , " O ' Neal said . " Because we were away from home , we took maximum advantage of the time . It was very intense , and every one of our instructors was brilliant . " The other Chicagoans who participated were Thomas O ' Neill , 35 , who has appeared in " Shear Madness , " Cameron Pfiffner , 27 , a member of Commons Theater ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the National program , and the 26 who were selected came from all sections of the country . They paid $1 , 050 apiece , covering accommodation and tuition , and as O ' Neill said , " We more than got our money ' s worth . " They spent one entire day with a man who works with masks , eventually getting up on the stage themselves with the masks and improvising a performance . They devoted another day to a workshop with a man doing a show that is being performed under water . They studied innovative voice techniques with other directors . " Whatever trends are going in this part of the world , the National was able to bring in people who could teach us about them , " Pfiffner said . The Chicagoans said they discovered there were definite differences in the approach that British and American directors take to acting . The British , they said , stress close attention to the text as a key to understanding a character . " We tend to be more free floating , " O ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stage , " said Pfiffner . " What I ' ve learned most , from Peter Gill , is really concentrating on the text , finding the correct way to say something . In the U.S. you will read over the text , and directors will say , ' Okay , you ' ve got the general idea , let ' s go with that . ' " The British directors , O ' Neal said , also discovered differences between British and American students of acting . " Our instructors said with American actors they know from the first day where the weaknesses lie because we are very open , " she said . " The British apparently find it difficult to open up and expose their weak points . " Trost said that to him the prime appeal of the National program was the opportunity to work with directors who have done Shakespeare , Restoration comedy and Jacobean tragedy . " You don ' t get directors in the U.S. with that same level of experience , " he said . " Here you get people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trost said British directors were generally impressed with the vocal approach of the Americans . " They say our way of speaking , with hard Rs for example , is probably closer to the speech patterns of Shakespeare ' s time than is the modern British way of speaking , " he said . O ' Neill said the directors pointed out that theater today is run by directors , in contrast to the era of actor/managers in the 19th Century , and they encouraged the Americans to become more independent . " They stressed that we should assert ourselves as actors  --  not create a revolution , but not be submissive because we are depending on a director , " he said . The only complaint the Chicagoans had about the National program was that three weeks was not long enough . " But what we have learned will make a lasting impression when we get back , " O ' Neal said . " It will start to show up in our work . " Kevin Cahill , 34 , who established the National ' s education department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was pleased with the result of the first summer acting program . " The actors we selected are good , " he said . " Some could be better , but they all have qualities we were looking for . This will become a better program , with better students , as time goes on . In two years time , we will have people really fighting to get on this program , and the overall standard should be excellent . " Cahill , who formerly taught theater in the north of England , said he decided to establish the program because of requests from American colleges and universities with which the National has a close working relationship and because of his desire to enhance the profile of the National Theater in the United States . " These actors will go back to the States and talk about how good it has been , and the word will get around , " he said . " At present our name is not as widely spread as that of the Royal Shakespeare Company . This will increase the general awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British directors and actors have derived a great deal of enthusiasm from their contact with the Americans . " This is something Americans bring with them that is very exciting , " he said . " I thought our directors should have the opportunity to work with talented young Americans . It energizes them , stimulates them and extends them in a way . " You have here a clash of cultures , and we were hoping to bring together the best of the two . It seems to have happened . It ' s been very exciting . The teachers loved it , and it ' s going to be a difficult act to follow next year . " Cahill said he also had noticed differences between American and British students . " The American students seem to have a hunger to learn . British students need to acquire a bit more of that , " he said . " As actors , the Americans are very strong emotionally , whereas their British counterparts are more comfortable with text . We have tried to open up the Americans ' ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a bit more . " He said it was possible that the program would last four weeks in the future . " There is virtue in compressing it , making it happen in a short time , " he said . " But we have not given them much breathing space .
