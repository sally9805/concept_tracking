@#  | Inventor John W. Evans shifted his black Ford Escort ' test car into fourth gear at 20 mph and floored the accelerator . The engine shuddered , trying to pull the too-tall gear , and strained as it made the long climb up the western Connecticut hill . " Listen to the engine , " he said . " Do you hear any knock ? " I did n't . The Escort seemed ordinary enough ? except for the dozen extra instrument-panel gauges . In the 15 miles we had driven that cool morning , Evans explained what the gauge readings meant . Probes in the engine 's cooling and lubrication systems were reporting the temperatures at different locations . As we climbed the long hill , he deliberately held the throttle full open . I watched the temperature of the coolant at the engine 's cylinder head climb slowly to 270 degrees F. " A conventional cooling system would have boiled over at about two hundred fifty degrees . It is virtually impossible to overheat this cooling system , regardless of the type of driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new system is more than just a better way to cool an engine . It also brings a host of unexpected benefits . But it certainly is strange . First , it runs backward ? pumping coolant in the " wrong " direction . Second , it uses not the ordinary ethylene glycol ( antifreeze ) and water mixture as coolant , but more-exotic propylene glycol , a substance whose other uses include sweetening food and keeping cake mix moist . If Evans is right , this weird system will bring a number of advantages . Among them : It will let the engine run 50 degrees hotter without damage , thus producing greater power , better fuel economy , and lower emissions . It will eliminate the danger of knocking , allowing designers to build a new generation of engines with higher compression ratios , raising performance and fuel economy still further . And it will work with a radiator one-half the size of those used in today 's cooling systems , giving designers the ability to create lower-drag bodies with sharply sloped hood lines . I recently visited Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conn. , to learn about the promising new development . How the new cooling system claims to accomplish the @#  | tricks described above can best be understood by contrasting it with a conventional cooling system . In the car you now drive , cooled fluid from the bottom of the radiator enters the engine , flows through the block around the cylinders , and then moves on to the hottest area , the cylinder head ( see drawing ) . It then flows back to the radiator to give up the load of heat it picked up on its trip through the engine . The coolant ? an ethylene glycol-water mixture ? is designed to run at average temperatures of 180 to 200 degrees F. Ordinarily , the mixture would boil at about 225 degrees . To raise the boiling point to about 260 degrees , the system is pressurized to 15 psi above atmospheric pressure . In Evans 's new system , the cooled fluid from the radiator flows first into the hot cylinder head , then through the engine block . And it is pure propylene glycol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The different systems create vastly different operating conditions . In the conventional system , says Evans , hot spots develop in the cylinder-head area , generally around spark plugs and exhaust valves . " When the coolant at these very hot areas boils and the surrounding coolant is too hot to condense the resulting vapor , the coolant vapor pushes liquid coolant away from metal surfaces of the cooling jacket . A blanket of vapor forms , which acts as an insulator , " Evans explains . " Then localized head temperatures go way up , creating hot spots that cause violent detonation , or knock . " Detonation is uncontrolled ignition that occurs when the fuel-air mixture is ignited by high-  | temperature areas in the combustion chamber , as well as by the spark plug . When the competing flame fronts violently collide , a rattling sound is produced , and serious piston damage can result . Evans 's goal was to eliminate the knock by eliminating the hot spots . As he pointed to the under-hood plumbing in three converted cars at Mecca Development 's engineering lab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his development . In an engine , he explained , boiling is a highly effective cooling process because it rapidly extracts heat from the metal of the combustion chamber . In fact , the idea that limited boiling could be useful occurred to him when he studied the cooling system in Henry Ford 's Model T. Ford 's car used an ebullient ( or boilingwater ) system to cool its low-compression low-output engine . It worked fine . In modern cars , though , the result is not so happy . In today 's hotter-running engines , when boiling gets out of control , so do head temperatures . The large volumes of coolant displaced from the water jacket by the expanding vapor end up in the plastic overflow container . And hot spots develop , encouraging knock . The propylene glycol coolant used in Evans 's system behaves quite differently . First , it has a higher boiling point . Second , it wo n't boil vigorously and produce large amounts of vapor that crowds the coolant out of the cylinder head . When localized boiling does occur at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly collapse when they contact the surrounding liquid , which is far below its own higher boiling point . " We want the propylene glycol to boil quietly to keep localized head temperatures under control , " Evans says . " Then we want to condense the vapor right away . " The result is that the hot spots that can cause detonation are not allowed to develop . Dan McCosh , PS Detroit editor , spoke about the new system with Greg Reny , a cooling-fluids research engineer at Dow Chemical Co. , which produces both ethylene glycol and propylene glycol , and supplies Mecca Development with coolant . " By going to a straight coolant fluid with no water , you raise the boiling point of the fluid , " Reny ex- L plains . " With the coolant 's boiling point raised , engines can be pushed past the capacity of a normal cooling system without overheating . In terms of transient loads , such as going up a hill or during fast acceleration , there is a real advantage . " In principle , the new system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be solved before it worked . For example , propylene glycol is hygroscopic . The sweet-tasting amber liquid readily absorbs one or two percent of its volume in moisture from the atmosphere . In a cooling system , this causes trouble . When the coolant boils locally , this small amount of water becomes a large volume of water vapor , forcing vital coolant away from the cylinder head and letting potentially damaging hot spots develop . The uncomplicated answer Evans found for the vapor problem is a major element of his patents . A condenser chamber mounted at the highest point in the cooling system allows the water-vapor bubbles that form when the coolant boils locally to rise by convection and escape to the atmosphere . Thus the system continuously purges itself of water that the propylene glycol absorbs from the air . Does it work ? The reverse flow distributes heat through the engine 's components more evenly than does the usual arrangement . " Traditionally , we have over-cooled the bottom of the engine in order to cool the top of the engine , " Evans says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reverse coolant flow will work only when there is a large difference between the coolant temperature and the boiling point of the coolant . In a conventional system , the coolant is near its boiling point as it exits the engine . If the coolant pump were to draw directly upon this liquid , flash vaporization would occur on the pump 's inlet side where low pressures lower the coolant 's boiling point . And once a pump designed to move liquid fills with vapor , it becomes ineffective . This problem does n't arise in Evans 's system because propylene glycol 's operating temperature is typically 100 degrees lower than its boiling point . With reversed flow direction , after the coolant extracts heat from the cylinder head , it is drawn down through the water jackets surrounding the cylinder bores , raising them to an operating temperature 40 or 50 degrees hotter than current practice permits . The inventor claims that these hotter cylinder walls have been shown in a Detroit auto maker 's dynamometer tests to yield fuel-economy improvements of six to eight percent . Although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans believes the mileage gains are explained by the warmer cylinder walls delaying quenching ( or extinction ) of the combustion flame as it radiates outward from the spark plug . Quenching occurs when the flame reaches an area that is too cool to sustain combustion . The result : More fuel is burned and more power developed . Further , the system 's ability to control cylinder-head hot spots allows engines to run with more ignition advance at higher compression ratios , Evans claims . The result is increased horsepower without accompanying knock , provided coolant-flow rate is increased by using a high-output pump . There is another benefit of propylene glycol 's high boiling point : The cooling system can be operated at atmospheric pressure . The heavy-duty hoses and fittings that are needed to contain the coolant in a pressurized system can be replaced with lighter components . The chance of leaks developing is reduced . Yet another striking aspect of the new system is the impact it could have on radiator design . Evans says that because his system rejects less heat from the engine and @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its size can be reduced by as much as 50 percent . The radiator can also be mounted in a horizontal position amenable to the no-grille " bottom breather " frontend designs now taking shape in Detroit 's design studios ( see drawing on opening pages ) . I asked Kent Kelly , manager of vehicle aerodynamics on General Motors ' design staff , how useful these features would be to body stylists . " We 're designing more forwardslanted hoods , which is putting the squeeze on coolingcomponent packaging , " he said . A half-sized radiator would be a welcome advantage . " What 's more , the new approach may make it possible to build engines with substantially higher compression ratios . Higher compression ratios mean wringing a higher percentage of the potential power out of every gallon of gasoline . Back in the days of leaded gas , powerful engines could be built with 10.5:1 or 11.5:1 ratios . With lead out and octane down , compression ratios had to be dropped to the present 8:1 or 9:1 . Now , with knocking brought under control by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compression ratios back up into the more efficient range . One last potential advantage : The new system may cure some old problems and make possible the use of certain desirable materials in engines . Research at Dow Chemical Co. has shown that straight propylene glycol causes less metal corrosion than does coolant containing water . It can be used with magnesium without causing corrosion , a severe problem that has so far made the lightweight metal unsuitable for use in liquid-cooled engine parts . " We 're excited about the prospects for this coolant and for the cooling system , " says Oliver Hayman , market development manager of chemicals and metals at Dow . @# Evans says he first got interested in cooling problems ? work that led to the present development ? through building high-horsepower racing engines . At the high compression ratios used in these engines ( he is now experimenting with a 17.5:1 compression ratio , 600-horsepower engine in his Chevrolet Camaro GT-1 race car ) the amount of heat generated is tremendous ; major problems are com-@#  | bating overheating , the tendency of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems As he watched the under-hood compartments in successive generations of smaller and smaller cars become hotter and more crowded , Evans began to feel that providing adequate cooling would eventually become a problem facing many automobile manufacturers . The problem has been getting worse over the years . According to Stan Mick , research engineer at GM 's technical center , the advent of exhaustemissions regulations led auto makers to greatly increase engine-coolant temperatures over the last decade . " We went from a hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit to a hundred sixty degrees . Then in 1978 we went to a hundred ninety-five degrees , using a fifteen-psi pressure cap . " The goal of the temperature increases was more-complete combustion . " The walls of the cylinder stay hotter , which lets the combustion flame burn closer to the walls and reduces hydrocarbon emissions , " Mick says . Researching various engine designs finally convinced Evans that better cooling was also the key to bringing knock under control , especially since lead is now being removed from all gasoline . " When I looked at turbocharged piston aircraft engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can run at very high cylinder-head temperatures ? about four hundred degrees Fahrenheit ? without headmetal damage . However , they must run rich air-fuel mixtures to avoid detonation and melted-piston problems . This showed me that the metal itself could withstand higher temperatures but that more work needed to be done to control hot spots and detonation . I concluded that there really would be no reason for knocking if there were no critical hot spots . So I realized I had to limit the amount of vapor in the head , " Evans recalls . His quest to control vapor formation in the cylinder-head coolant jacket eventually led to the use of higherboiling-point coolants , of which propylene glycol has so far shown to be the best . At the same time , a lot of development effort was required to identify and solve , with the condenser , the water-contamination problem that comes along with using straight propylene glycol coolant . Expert opinions I asked several experts familiar with Evans 's new cooling system what they thought of it . One of them is Doi .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years developing cooling systems for Chevrolet ( where he worked on the high-performance Z28 Camaro ) , and more recently for the Chevrolet-PontiacCanada division . " When I was assigned to look at the system , I did n't think it was a good idea . But I 've seen it work , " he says . Nawrocki feels that raising bulk coolant temperature from 200 degrees F to about 240 degrees is acceptable . He observes that today 's cars already tolerate this temperature under severe operating conditions , and that propylene glycol controls hot spots by boiling locally when these areas reach 370 degrees . " The biggest problem with Evans 's system is that you have to take everything you know about cooling and throw it out the window . This may make its acceptance a long way off , " he reflects . PS Consulting Editor Smokey Yunick , who has done extensive work with high-temperature adiabatic engines PS , April ' 83 , thinks Evans is on the right track . " Eventually , auto makers are going t1 use propylene glycol coolant with reverse flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yunick says . " That 's how they 're going to control detonation . " Sifting through the oft-steamy annals of engine-cooling technology as I researched this article , one nagging question took shape in my mind : This invention is not really very complicated . Why has n't anyone done this before ? " Conventional wisdom says when the coolant temperature gets to around two hundred forty degrees , the engine starts to knock . Therefore it must be too hot . There 's a very strong mind-set on this question in the auto industry , " Evans says . " We have shown that engines can run hotter , without knock , by keeping peak cylinder-head temperatures under control . " What lies ahead Evans and his cooling system are getting a hearing in Detroit ; GM has been evaluating the performance of several converted test cars at its engineering facilities . Says Don Runkle , Chevrolet chief engineer : " Raising the operating temperature of the coolant ? as this system does ? has an appeal if you look at the thermodynamics . It works better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid and the atmosphere . " But , Runkle adds , he 's not yet convinced Evans 's system can control knock and emissions . " As soon as it works , we will put it on a car . " @#
