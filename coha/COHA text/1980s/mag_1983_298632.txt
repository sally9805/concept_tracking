COVER STORIES <P> Jesse Jackson spearheads a new black drive for political power <P> Run , Jesse , run ! Run , Jesse , run.The chants roll toward him , rumbling like a pent-up storm , rising to the rafters and the stained-glass portrait of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . With the practiced rhythms of preacher and pitchman , he launches his sermon on power . " There 's a freedom train acoming , " he intones . " But you got to be registered to ride . " Amen ! " Get on board ! Get on board ! " There is fire in his eyes , a pin in his starched collar , a finger in the air . " We can move from the slave ship to the championship ! From the guttermost to the uppermost ! From the outhouse to the courthouse ! From the statehouse to the White House ! " The well-dressed congregation of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles erupts with the same chant that has resounded in the Delta country of Mississippi , in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-styled country preacher seems less and less likely to resist . Run , Jesse , run ! Run , Jesse , run ! <P> Jesse Louis Jackson , 41 , the illegitimate son of a South Carolina high school student has for 15 years sought to don the mantle of his mentor Martin Luther King Jr . By turns he can be fascinating and frightening , inspiring and irritating , charismatic and controversial . And so too is the crusade he has been considering . On one level it would be the ultimate embodiment of the American political ideal , an affirmation that every child of the nation , yes even a black one , can some day seek the presidency . Yet on another level , it would be as far removed from conventional politics as Jackson is removed from conventional politicians . <P> The rally in Los Angeles a week ago marked Jackson 's latest tentative step toward becoming a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination . His " exploratory committee , " led by Mayor Richard Hatcher of Gary , Ind. , officially became the Jesse Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll and sound out black leaders to see if there is sufficient support for such a race . But most of the leaders who are on the committee seem already to have made up their minds . Hatcher reminds the audience in the adobe-colored church that Americans like to tell their children that if they work hard enough they can grow up to be President . " I have one proposition to leave you with , " he says . " Either we ought to stop lying to our children or we ought to start believing it and doing the things necessary to make it come true . " Bishop H.H. Brookins takes the podium to ridicule the large number of black officeholders who are wary , even downright disapproving , of a Jackson candidacy . " We did not have to ask black elected officials what they thought we should do , because after all we elected them ! " he preaches . " If not now , when ? If not Jesse , who ? " <P> For the past few months , Jackson has been crisscrossing the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . He will cry : " We need 10,000 blacks running for office from Virginia around to Texas-county clerks , supervisors , sheriffs , judges , legislators , Governors-Just run ! Run ! Run !
