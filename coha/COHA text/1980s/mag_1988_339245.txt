In normal times that would not be surprising : since the country 's last democratic government was ousted in a 1962 coup , Burma has been virtually closed to visiting foreign correspondents .

" This is the first genuinely popular revolt I have ever witnessed , " he says . " The people here have faced armed force with moral force and given the world a lesson in courage .
