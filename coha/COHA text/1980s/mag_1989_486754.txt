What 's immediately striking in Robert Hass 's work is the sheer abundance of pleasures . Who else among our poets would bring together the delights of landscape , climate and food in a salad " with chunks of cooked chicken in a creamy basil mayonnaise a shade lighter than the Coast Range in August " ( " Vintage " ) or include a recipe for onion soup ? complete with shredded Samsoe and advice on how to eat it with friends ? as a " Song to Survive the Summer " ? In his incisive collection of essays , Twentieth Century Pleasures , Hass set our engagement with poetry squarely in the context of other forms of satisfaction ? in domestic life , in nature , in the senses . The title of his new book of poetry , Human Wishes , reveals his basic concerns : He is a student of desire , of what we want and how likely we are to get it . If one pleasure of poetry is the evocation of beautiful things , Hass 's work definitely satisfies . From his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series of Younger Poets Award in 1973 , through Praise in 1979 and now Human Wishes , he has shown a mastery of sensory description , combining the light touch of a calligrapher with the specificity of a botanist . Place ? particularly northern California , where he grew up and now lives ? has always been central in Hass 's poetry , and few writers capture the special qualities of this environment as well . " January " gives a fine sense of that gorgeous oddity , a Bay Area winter : Back at my desk : no birds , no rain , but light  --  the white of Shasta daisies , and two red geraniums against the fence , and the dark brown of wet wood , glistening a little as it dries . Hass 's continuing engagement with Japanese poetry is evident here . Casual in tone , the lines seem almost transparDon Bogen is the author of After the Splendid Display ( Wesleyan University Press ) .

" no birds , no rain " ? and the sudden appearance of those specific , polysyllabic Shasta daisies ; the step-by-step expansion of the color scheme ? " white , " " red , " then " dark brown " ; the subtle echoes of sound in " red " and " wet , " " daisies " and " dries " ; and the hint of blank verse for closure in the last line show a rigorous and self-effacing craftsmanship . The lines have been written so well they hardly seem " written " at all . With his California subjects and his skill at evocation , Hass could easily have settled for the reproduction of a predictable and popular verse " product . " Indeed , a few years after Field Guide came out , a small fad for poems with references to food , accounts of hikes and other surface elements of his work flourished in the literary magazines . But Hass is after something more than sensuous word painting . The mind behind the description is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often provides . The poems in Human Wishes are energetic and full of surprises . They turn on themselves suddenly , breaking into self-consciousness or rejecting their initial visions , as when the idyllic reverie of " Late Spring " is revealed to be a fabrication that keeps the poet awake at night , or the list of pretty images at the start of " Spring Drawing " and again in " Spring Drawing 2 " implies but then fails to generate a sentence . H ass 's awareness of the limits of lan- guage helps fuel his restless exploration of different poetic strategies . Each of his books makes use of a range of approaches and forms , from rhymed iambic pentameter to haiku , from brief lyrics to sequences of fragments to long discursive meditations . In Human Wishes he consolidates the strengths of his earlier work while pushing on into fresh territory . The first section of the book , for example , develops a new kind of line : lengthy , proselike in its rhythms and set off in a stanza by itself . These lines function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical like the one about chicken salad , othersgnarled with abstraction like these from the first poem in the book , " Spring Drawing " : as if spint attended to plainness only , the more complicated forms exhausting it , tossed-off grapestems becoming crystal chandeliers , as if radiance were the meaning of meaning , and Justice responsible to daydream not only for the stnct beauty of denial , but as a felt need to reinvent the inner form of wishing . Hass has never shied away from the language of theoretical discourse . In fact , he finds a rarefied music in the polysyllabic abstractions , long clauses and parallel constructions of his argument . This is not a music everyone will enjoy . It can be daunting to encounter a passage like the one above on the first page of a book of poetry . But if the demands on a reader are high , they signal Hass 's commitment to his enterprise : an art that can both evoke and analyze the complexity of human desires . The second section of Human Wishes consists of prose poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Praise but not developed consistently until now . Rimbaud is the father of this type of poem , and much American work in the genre still reads like a bad translation from the French . Hass has avoided the portentousness and easy surrealism that can afflict paragraphs trying too hard to be poetic . Instead , he looks to narrative models ? the short story , the anecdote  --  as well as to allegory and the personal essay as guideposts . A few of the shorter prose poems ? " Duck Blind , " " In the Bahamas " ? can seem a little thin , but the longer pieces give him room to juxtapose scenes and events , building up a constellation of meaning . " The Harbor at Seattle , " for example , looks at friendship and personal tragedy within different contexts of history , art and work . Each paragraph in this beautifully structured poem works like a controlled reaction as the poet puts two elements together , notes the effects , then moves on to the next step . In the title poem of Human Wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page-long paragraph uses rapid shifts of focus , from the Upanishads to a Cambridge pub , to expose a web of varied individual desires  --  for beauty , for understanding , for wealth , for a good time with friendsin all its intricacy and imperfection . The unspoken element in all " human wishes " is , of course , vanity . Hass may not be as explicit as Juvenal on this point  --  he finds beauty in some of these wishes , flawed as they are  --  but he 's well aware of the devastating power of time and human failings . In the extended meditations that make up the last two sections of Human Wishes , he traces pleasures and their loss ? in love , in family life , in the living world ? with intelligence and a deft control of tone . Despite the wealth of personal detail in these poems , there is little overt self-dramatization . The poet is not set up as the tragic hero of his own life . His presence in the work is rather that of a man thinking : remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the prose poems , the strength of these meditations lies in Hass 's ability to handle several themes at the same time and his exploration of the range of possibilities the form presents . In one of the most intriguing , " Berkeley Eclogue , " he takes on the hoary literary convention of the pastoral dialogue . The decorous speech of stylized shepherds becomes an internal argument , with a harsh second voice ? a kind of nagging muse ? prodding the poet toward more clarity and depth with italicized comments such as " You can skip this part " and " Do you believe in that ? " Other meditations are symphonic in structure . " Santa Barbara Road " introduces , repeats and varies several different motifs ? the poet building a bench , children and their parents , classical Chinese thought , June weather , various walks ? in an extended reflection on the abundance and impermanence of family life . Hass 's sense of the interrelatedness of all human endeavor gives his book a breadth of perspective and a distinct focus . Even the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own memories at the end of " Thin Air " is connected to the frustrated warehouse worker who packed the tea leaves . This is not liberal sympathy but a recognition of how things work , of the context of suffering and loss in which we live . It is a mark of Hass 's integrity as a poet that he rejects the usual consolations here . Art , nature , love ? these are certainly pleasures but not solutions . They are parts of what he calls in " On Squaw Peak " .. the abundance the world gives , the **27;3011;TOOLONG surpnse of it , waves breaking , the sudden fragrance of the mimulus at creekside sharpened by the summer dust . Things bloom up there . They are for their season alive in those bright vanishings of air we ran through .

The characters , between whom the distances are long and harsh as the salt flats of Freeman 's native Utah , gaze out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes right beside them . In The Chinchilla Farm , her first novel , Freeman follows with a character every bit as wistful . Verna Flake , the engaging narrator , sings snatches of Patsy Cline songs to herself : She 's been done wrong but just ca n't seem to forget the bum . Verna 's got more grit than your average country-music heroine , though ; when her husband walks out she demands that he leave the truck and trailer so she can move out of Utah and start a new life . Although Verna takes to the road , her husband is still with her , every memory leading back to him . She often pictures him out in a hayfield , where " it seems to me that maybe he 's stopped work in order to look over the land he grew up on . But then he turns slightly and I see what he 's really doing . He 's relieving himself on the silver weeds .
