Surrounded by enemies , Israel takes its security seriously . Sometimes too seriously , as three official rebukes last week indicated . A two-member panel appointed by the Cabinet found the entire government responsible for the activities of Jonathan Jay Pollard , the American intelligence analyst sentenced this year by a U.S. court to life imprisonment as an Israeli spy . But the panel declined to single out any individual for culpability . A second investigation , conducted by a parliamentary intelligence subcommittee headed by former Foreign Minister Abba Eban , then pinned blame squarely on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin . Peres , who received particular criticism for mishandling the case as Prime Minister in 1985 when Pollard was arrested , stated , " I have nothing to apologize for . " U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering quickly made clear that Washington expects those involved in the spy scandal to be punished . <P> In a third setback for the government , the Supreme Court issued a ruling highly critical of Shin Bet , the domestic security service that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deaths of two Palestinian bus hijackers . The court ordered former Lieutenant Azat Napso , 32 , released immediately from prison , where he had spent 7 1/2 years on espionage and treason charges that were brought by Shin Bet but later found to be unsubstantiated . The conviction was overturned because the agency employed illegal interrogation methods and lied about them to the military courts that originally tried Napso . Attorney General Yosef Harish has launched an investigation into these acts . The probe may result in criminal charges being leveled against eleven former and current Shin Bet agents . In the wake of the week 's three adverse judgments , the Cabinet deliberated whether to begin its own probe , and Shamir pledged to increase supervision over all national security agencies .
