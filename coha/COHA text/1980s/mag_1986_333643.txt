" The Pacific is where the future of the world lies . " <P>  --  Ronald Reagan , October 1984 <P> " The Soviet Union is also an Asian and Pacific country . " <P>  --  Mikhail Gorbachev , July 1986 <P> Three U.S. naval ships last week pulled into the northern Chinese port of Qingdao as a 21-gun salute fired and a 27-piece brass band played Happy Days Are Here Again . The vessels were in China for a six-day stopover , the first such visit by American military ships to the People 's Republic since the Communist takeover in 1949 . The port call had been delayed by more than a year , following Peking 's unexpected statement that no nuclear-armed vessels would be permitted to dock . But the Chinese apparently had second thoughts after reports began to circulate last summer that North Korea had granted Soviet vessels calling rights at the port of Nampo , just 340 miles across the Yellow Sea . As Peking and Washington basked in last week 's goodwill , the U.S. maintained its policy of refusing to say whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no questions about the nuclear capacities of the visiting vessels . <P> The port call was a symbolic victory for Washington in the diplomatic war of nerves now emerging in the Pacific between the superpowers . The contest began in earnest 15 months ago , when Moscow secured fishing rights to the tuna-rich waters of Kiribati , a tiny 33-island former British colony in the South Pacific . Since then , much has happened to heighten Washington 's jitters . Last June , Vanuatu , formerly the British-French territory of New Hebrides , opened diplomatic relations with Moscow , following the lead of Fiji and three other Pacific island states . Vanuatu is currently negotiating a pact with the Soviets that would include , in addition to fishing licenses , port and landing rights . <P> If Moscow 's Pacific overtures were confined to the island states , the Klaxons might not be sounding so furiously in Washington . But the Soviet diplomatic offensive has a wider reach . Last June the Kremlin created a new bureau within the Foreign Ministry , the so-called Pacific Ocean Department , and began dispatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 28 , in a 90-minute address in Vladivostok , the Soviet Union 's main Pacific port , General Secretary Gorbachev boldly signaled far larger designs . Reminding his audience that the " greater part of our territory lies east of the Urals , in Asia , " Gorbachev mapped out an ambitious Soviet policy that includes extensive diplomatic and economic ties throughout the region , concentrating on China and Japan . <P> The speech received close attention in Washington . Since World War II the U.S. has been the Pacific 's paramount power , and since 1980 the Pacific Rim has superseded Western Europe as America 's most important overseas trading partner . The Vladivostok speech showed that the Soviets intend to claim a share of Asia 's economic success . Some analysts also heard an implied threat to U.S. military supremacy in the region . Says Rick Fisher of the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank in Washington : " The Soviet goal in Asia is power . "                   @ @
