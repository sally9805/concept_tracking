Ad agency Ammirati &; Puris will enter into discussions " probably next week " to try to buy itself back from Omnicom Group , according to Martin Puris , Ammirati ' s co-chairman and chief executive officer . In an interview , Mr. Puris said his agency ' s management hopes to complete a buy-back that will leave Ammirati independent , with no partners . He added , " We really have to do it soon , because clients are demanding to have some sort of resolution . " Ammirati , a midsized shop with about $210 million in billings , is known for its lush creative work , richly photographed ads and often upscale client list . Clients include BMW , for which it created " The Ultimate Driving Machine " campaign ; Club Med , " the antidote for civilization ; " and Schweppes , " Great British bubbly . " A buy-out or sale of Ammirati has been expected since Ammirati ' s London-based parent , Boase Massimi Pollitt , agreed last month to be acquired by New York-based Omnicom . Mr. Puris said buy-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Ammirati ' s six-month financial report , which probably will be finished in the next few business days . Omnicom ' s acquisition plan calls for merging Boase Massimi with Omnicom ' s DDB Needham Worldwide unit  --  a combination that creates some enormous client conflict problems for Ammirati . The major conflict is posed by DDB Needham ' s Volkswagen/Audi account , which clashes with BMW at Ammirati , by far Ammirati ' s largest account . Other potential conflicts include Ammirati ' s Schweppes account and Omnicom ' s Pepsi business . If Ammirati succeeds in buying itself back , it will be one of the very few midsized ad agencies to keep hold of its independence . Virtually all of its mid-sized competitors have been gobbled up by large agencies , leaving the ad business the province of the very large and the very small . Ammirati and Omnicom are already gearing up to haggle over price . Neither side would comment on a potential price , but Boase Massimi paid about $32 million for Ammirati in 1987 , plus later payments that were to be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ammirati ' s management , if successful , will ultimately pay in the mid-$30 million range to buy the agency back . But Ammirati ' s success isn ' t assured . Omnicom wouldn ' t comment , but an industry executive familiar with the company ' s plans said it had received " several inquiries from interested buyers , " both in the U.S. and abroad , at a price the executive said is " about $40 million . " Among foreign companies , BDDP Group , a French agency that made an unsuccessful bid for Boase Massimi , is known to be interested in Ammirati . The executive said the two most acquisitive British firms , WPP Group and Saatchi &; Saatchi , haven ' t made any overtures ; both firms ' agencies handle competing car accounts . " It ' s a question of price , " the executive said . " Omnicom would like to reach an agreement where the Ammirati management is fully motivated and is happy with the arrangement , and that would be most easily achievable in a case where the agency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t there , Omnicom will have to find some other way , and maybe Ammirati will be part-owners with another agency . " Mr. Puris , however , said his management plans to buy itself back alone and independently , with " no affiliation " with any other group . He said financing shouldn ' t be a problem " as long as we can arrive at a sane multiple of current earnings . " Boase Massimi also owns minority interests in two U.S. agencies , San Francisco-based Goodby , Berlin &; Silverstein , and New York-based Angotti , Thomas , Hedge . Angotti President Barrie Hedge said his agency is currently " in discussions to decide whether to stay in or out . " And Omnicom ' s chief executive officer , Bruce Crawford , was in San Francisco yesterday to discuss the same issue with Goodby Berlin management . Goodby Berlin has a 10-month option allowing it to buy back its interest , according to Geoffrey Panek , chief financial officer . Mr. Crawford , he added , " is out here kicking the tires . He bought us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought . We ' re going to talk about their thoughts for the future and ours . We aren ' t rushing into anything. "  --  - Ad Notes . . . .
