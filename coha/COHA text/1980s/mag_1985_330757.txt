It will take weeks , perhaps months , to assess the financial toll of last week 's earthquakes . But most analysts of Mexican affairs would agree that the disaster could not have come at a worse time for the country 's troubled economy . As Peter Bell , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington , puts it , " Mexico has been going through something like the trials of Job . " <P> For more than two years , Mexicans have endured the imposition of one austerity package after another . They have watched government food subsidies shrink , unemployment rise , the value of the peso sink ( it slid to an all-time low last week of 372 to the U.S. dollar ) . Yet now , on top of such belt tightening , Mexico City and four coastal states need major reconstruction programs that will consume already tight reserves of capital . " It is a tremendous psychological blow , " says M. Delal Baer , an expert on Mexico at Georgetown University 's Center for Strategic and International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conspiring against Mexico . " <P> In the weeks ahead , Mexico may ask whether international bankers and Saudi oilmen are conspiring as well . A little more than a month ago , Mexico 's Finance Ministry admitted that inflation was running at 59% instead of the 35% prescribed by the International Monetary Fund , and the budget deficit was about 8% of total economic output for 1985 , instead of 5.3% . Since Mexico has not met the fund 's terms , it would normally not be allowed to draw on a $900 million line of credit that remains from a three-year $3.4 billion IMF loan . " We could never have complied with that deficit requirement , even before this tragedy , " Mexican Economist Clemente Ruiz Duran said the day after the first earthquake . " Now it 's even less realistic . " The IMF may agree . Late last week the U.S. State Department suggested that any suspension of IMF loans would " undoubtedly be held in abeyance " until Mexico had a chance to assess the economic consequences of the disaster . <P> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks second only to Brazil in the developing world as a debtor , is saddled with a $96 billion foreign debt , of which $77.7 billion was lent by a consortium of 300 international banks . Last month most of those banks agreed to extend through the end of the century Mexico 's repayments on $48.7 billion of the total amount due . About 30 banks , however , have yet to sign the accord , and there are concerns among bankers that the impact of the great quake may lead them to withhold their signatures even longer . " Unless all banks sign , " says one U.S. financier , " the whole package could come unstrung . " Moreover , Mexican officials estimated last month that they would need about $3 billion in new foreign loans in 1986 to keep economic growth at its current rate of about 3% annually . Banks that were wary then are certain to be even more hesitant in the wake of the tremors.
