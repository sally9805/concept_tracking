Under pressure , the Saudis push up the cost of crude <P> Even in the normally supercharged atmosphere of petro politics , last week 's meeting in Vienna of foreign , finance and oil ministers from the 13-member OPEC cartel was highly unusual . The Austrian capital is OPEC 's administrative headquarters , but no meeting of oil ministers had been held there since December 1975 , when pro-Palestinian terrorists kidnaped some of the delegates and held them hostage . Saudi Arabia 's Oil Minister , Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani , the principal target of the 1975 raid , was taking no chances on a repeat performance . First he sent his private plane to Vienna 's Schwechat Airport , and then let rumors circulate that he would arrive on Monday . In fact , he showed up in another plane on Sunday night . During the meeting , he was constantly surrounded by his own British-trained security officers as well as by Austrian antiterrorist policemen carrying Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns . <P> The conference was held in the majestic 705-year-old imperial Hofburg Palace , but the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowed by the bitter border dispute between Iran and Iraq , both OPEC members . And at one point the Iranian Oil Minister , Ali Akbar Moinfar , accused the Saudis of catering to " Western imperialists . " Said one Iranian delegate after two days of bickering : " This thing is going to blow sky-high . " <P> In those surroundings of tight security and contention , the oil cartel last week was seeking to reach agreement on a long-range pricing and production strategy . Several key OPEC countries , including Saudi Arabia , want to replace the current erratic increases in the cost of crude oil with a system of regular quarterly price hikes that would be tied to the level of inflation in industrialized nations . The Saudis are also anxious to return to a unified OPEC oil price . Since last July , rates have ranged from $28 to $37 per bbl . Prior to the meeting , the Saudis hinted that they would be willing to cut their production from 9.5 million bbl. per day to 8.5 million , if agreement could be reached on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world glut of oil that has been pushing down the price of OPEC crude for the past four months . <P> After three days of charges , threats and bluffs , the oil ministers hammered out a shaky compromise . The Saudis agreed to raise their price from $28 per bbl. to $30 , while the other OPEC members said that they would freeze theirs at existing levels , which average about $32 . The Saudis , however , also announced that they will continue to produce 9.5 million bbl. per day , thus maintaining the market pressure for lower prices . The proposed quarterly increases of oil prices will be discussed further at a 20th anniversary summit meeting of OPEC countries in Baghdad in November . <P> Last week 's increase in the price of Saudi oil is expected to raise the cost of gasoline and heating oil in the U.S. by less than a penny per gallon . Western observers , who had feared that a drop in Saudi production would lead to a new escalation of oil prices , sighed with some relief after the meeting . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their economies hang on the decisions of the fractious oil cartel .
