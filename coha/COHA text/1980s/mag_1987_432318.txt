 | In today 's hi-tech medical world , nursing is more important than ever . But how do nurses cope with the pressure ? Here three women from Johns Hopkins Hospital tell their dramatic stories Anyone who has spent time in a hospital knows how crucial nurses are to a patient 's recovery . Yet hospital staffs with " heart " ? those who make personal care as much a priority as technological cure ? are all too rare in the 1980s . One notable exception is Johns Hopkins , the prestigious teaching hospital in Baltimore , Md. , where the patient 's comfort , well-being , and dignity are always a primary concern . Nowhere is this attitude more evident than in the sensitive , life-and-death environment of the hospital 's critical-care units . Here , meet three nurses who work long , hard hours in these high-pressure arenas . Highly skilled and dedicated , they all bring to their work a special quality that goes beyond professional expertise : a deep personal caring . Still in her blue scrubs after a particularly grueling day , Maureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is the cardiac operating room where she is right at home among the pumps , monitors , pacemakers , and other elaborate equipment used during heart-bypass surgery . " It takes nine of us working in close quarters to handle this machinery , " says Maureen , " two surgeons , two anesthesiologists , two bypass specialists , two nurses , and one physician 's assistant . We 're working elbow to elbow , under pressure , so we ca n't afford to have anyone blow his cool . " Maureen 's job is part-time ? three days a week ? but it 's more demanding than most full-time careers . Although she spends four days at home with son Patrick , four , and daughter , Alison , 14 months , she is on emergency call an additional day a week and one weekend per month . She remembers a recent Saturday with her family that was interrupted by a call ? an 83-year-old heart-attack victim was in immediate need of a bypass operation As she drove to the hospital , Maureen admits she wondered : What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The patient was a retired businessman , " says Maureen , " but here at Hopkins , everyone gets the same treatment . " A key part of her job is to give patients support and reassurance before they go into surgery . " I walked beside the patient 's stretcher as he was wheeled into the OR , trying to be cheerful ? even though I knew that at his age this was a critical operation . " Maureen remembers . " As he went into the OR he had that ' I know I 'm dying ' look on his face . His eyes focused directly on me as if to say , I need your help . ' That  | look never fails to give you goose bumps when you see it ? and in this unit you see it often . " As scrub nurse , I handled all the instruments needed by the surgeons during the procedure . The patient 's chest was opened up and his heart put on the bypass machine . The really dramatic moment occurred when the pump was shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over . If his 83-yearold heart did n't pump well enough , nothing we did would have helped him ? but luckily , it responded . Within hours the man was recovering . " A few days later I saw the old gentleman . He was alert and cheerful , and the twinkle in his eye showed me that age is how old you feel and act . I was so glad I 'd come in on that Saturday to help him . ' Let me not judge , ' I said to myself . Maybe this man has 10 more good years . ' " Maureen remembers that case as fairly routine , but others are hair-raisingly close . " That same week a 24-year-old woman arrived by ambulance all the way from New Jersey , " she recalls . " She had an aneurysm ? the Marfam Syndrome ? with the aorta bulging like a balloon and in imminent danger of rupturing . Her blood pressure was dropping dramatically and emergency surgery was essential . Then , just as we positioned her on the operating table , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to move fast to repair the aorta . We all thought we were going to lose her ? or that if she did survive she 'd be a vegetable because of the loss of oxygen to the brain . But surgeons never give up ! " By the next morning the woman was not only awake , she was talking normally . I 'm not a religious person , but I do believe in guardian angels , and I believe that that girl 's time was n't up yet . There is simply no medical explanation for why she survived in the shape she did . " Of course , " Maureen adds , " for every miracle like that one , there is a routine case that suddenly goes awry , and for no apparent reason the patient gets an infection or has a stroke . " She stirs her coffee for a moment , then suddenly brightens . " Perhaps the most exciting part of my work is being a member of the organ-transplant team . It 's an unbelievable advance in medicine to think that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get hearts for our transplant surgery . " One recent night Maureen got an emergency call to fly to Cleveland , Ohio , where the parents of a brain-dead 10-year-old boy had offered to donate the child 's heart to a girl with a rapidly deteriorating heart back at Hopkins . " I dashed to the hospital where I met with the rest of the team : two surgeons , two operating-room nurses , and the transplant coordinator , who had located the heart . After changing into my scrubs , I made up the heart preservation solution and filled the cooler that the team carries the heart in with ice . By 11:30 P.M. we were on our way to the jet that would fly us to Cleveland . " From then on it was split-second timing , " recalls Maureen , " because the heart has to be implanted in the patient within four hours of the time it 's removed from the donor . Our flying time to Cleveland was one hour and two minutes . By the time we got to the hospital there , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical team worked quickly but meticulously to remove the heart . As we operated we were very conscious of the clock ticking away the seconds of that little girl 's life at Hopkins . " Then we put the precious heart into the cooler and we rushed back to the airport , sirens screaming . Hopkins knew the exact time of arrival in Baltimore , and as the ambulance tore through the city our little girl had already been opened up to receive her new lease on life . We ran with our cooler and delivered it safely to the cardiac OR . " Later the team learned that the implant had been a success and the girl had a good chance for a normal life . Happy for the child , Maureen nevertheless could n't help but think of the donor . " I had to be objective about the death of that poor little boy in order to do my job , " she says , " but later I could n't help putting myself and my own son in the same situation . I feel deeply for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this wonderful thing ? giving us their son 's heart so that another child might be saved . " Maureen slowly finishes her third cup of coffee , then walks back to her locker to change into her " civvies " ? street clothes ? for the drive home . Tomorrow she is planning a " normal " day ? a much-anticipated outing to the zoo with her children . Seated in her cubbyhole office , Carol talks about her commitment to her job treating desperately ill children and adolescents in the Children 's Center . For five years before that she worked in the hospital 's pediatric oncology unit . ( Oncology is the study of tumors , usually associated with cancer . ) Currently , as pediatric hospice coordinator , she does most of her nursing in children 's homes . " I like to nurse the very sick because I know I make a difference ? the parents tell me , the children tell me . When the parents realize I care about their kids above and beyond just being with them for eight hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks over at a framed picture of a young girl that 's sitting on her desk . " That 's Sherry , " she says . She died of cancer just before her eighteenth birthday . Sherry and I had a very close relationship for the year she was in the hospital . Her parents were divorced and she lived with her father . I felt like her mother in some ways . " One day she said to me , When I turn 18 , can I leave home and come live with you ? ' That was a heartbreaker because I knew she would never make it to 18 . I gulped a couple of times and answered , Sure , Sherry , I have an extra room and you can help me take care of my dog . ' " The day she died , a minister and I sat together at her bedside . Sherry was in and out of consciousness , talking aloud to God , trying to have Him square it with her family about leaving them and living with me . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapsed into a coma just after her father finally arrived . Frankly it was a relief for me because I knew how much she had suffered . Still , I did n't sleep well that night , and then in the early hours of the morning the hospital called to tell me it was all over . " I went to Sherry 's funeral , and as I sat in the church I thought about the special chemistry between us . I remembered that on her last day I 'd found her sitting at the nurses ' station because she knew how close death was and she did n't want to be alone . " I try to go to the funerals of children I 've been close to . It means a lot to the parents . " Carol pauses , then recalls a patient whose story had a happy ending . " Chris , aged seven , had aplastic anemia ? which means something was wrong with his bone marrow and no new blood cells were being made . " Chris and his family lived in North Carolina but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bonemarrow transplant . After undergoing chemotherapy to wipe out his diseased bone marrow , he received a healthy transplant from his sister . " He was recovering well until around the fourth week , when he developed a life-threatening infection . His cramps from diarrhea were so terrible that he would scream loud enough for the whole floor to hear . He was in such agony that he was on a continuous morphine drip . He could n't even digest his food , though he badly wanted to eat . Occasionally we 'd scrounge around  | and find his favorite fruit Popsicle ? root beer ? and give it to him . The rest of his nourishment came from a feeding tube down his nose , and an I.V . " Many times we thought we would lose him , but he was amazingly brave . He would cry ? but he held still for whatever procedure was necessary . " Chris stayed at Hopkins for close to seven months , but he went home cured ? we hope . Kids are wonderfully resilient . But his mother said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Can you imagine spending all that time in a hospital room in Baltimore while your husband and two daughters have to stay in North Carolina ? The husband would occasionally come up on weekends , and on one trip , the couple 's anniversary , the nurses decided to make it a special event ? we bought wine , candles , lasagna , and threw a little party . The couple were terribly surprised , and Chris thought it was great . " The parents managed to survive those troubled times , Carol reports . and Chris himself is a walking miracle . Carol remembers another case that was even more difficult . " William , aged 16. was a problem adolescent who 'd been fooling around with chemicals that blew up in his face and hands , " she says . " He had first- and seconddegree burns . I had to give him tub baths to scrub off the dead skin ? essential for controlling infection ? but terribly painful . I 'd tell him , ' William , we have to get the old scab off so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would scream out , ' How can you do this to me ! Leave me alone ! ' One day he threatened to drown himself , and slipped under the water . Another nurse hurried in and we grabbed Will under the arms and pulled him up . I was pretty shook up after that . " William should have healed well , but he had dark skin , which forms keloid tissue resulting in bad scarring . His condition got worse and worse . When he returned to the hospital for plastic surgery , he had no use of his hands , and his face looked so monstrous that kids in the elevator began to scream when they saw him . " Carol shakes her head as she tells the surprising outcome of the case . The plastic surgery on his face and hands did n't improve his appearance but did enable him to see better and use his hands . Afterward he finally received intensive psychiatric help and was sent to a school for the physically handicapped . " Although he did n't do well at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became valedictorian of his class . After that he went on to college and is now hoping to become a minister . " Carol looks at her watch . " I 'll have to get home soon to take my dog for a run . It 's necessary for him and good for me , too ? it clears my mind of the stresses of the day . " CAROL LONG Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , Carol helps critically ill newborns survive a very rocky entry into this world . The babies are born with a variety of problems : prematurity , congenital diseases , and a host of other disorders . An attractive bundle of energy in blue scrubs and running shoes , Carol begins her typically hectic 12-hour day at 7 A.M. " When I take over from the night shift , I review the babies ' charts and medication , and check to see if they are getting the right amount of oxygen , " she says . " By 7:20 I 've changed them , changed their feeding tubes , and begun their feedings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone . Allaying their fears is almost as important as looking after their children . " Carol talks about her choice of career . " I chose a service-oriented profession because I have to feel that what I do matters more than just bringing home a paycheck . In nursing , each day is different and there is immediate satisfaction in what I do . " As she walks through the unit , Carol explains the  | workings of some of the hi-tech machinery there . " In NICU you have to like problem-solving and be intrigued by the equipment , " she says . " You can do only so much with your own hands , and you have to be able to fine-tune the monitors . " There are many dramatic moments in the NICU . but one recent case actually made history . " In March 1982 conjoined ( Siamese ) twin girls , joined from thorax to umbilicus , were brought in to he surgically separated , " says Carol . " Emily and Francesca were so closely joined that they scratched each other continuously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three after birth ) of this kind ever attempted in the United States . The only organ the twins had shared was the liver , which the surgeons divided . After the surgery , the girls were completely separated . Francesca went home in July . but Emily had some damage to her neurological system and had to stay until November . " How did the babies ' family react to the shock of having Siamese twins ? " In this case , the mother was very strong , " says Carol , " but I have seen families ruined by less severely damaged babies . " She smiles . " But this case ended so nicely . Emily now goes to therapy daily , and Francesca is very sweet with her sister . I became friendly with the parents and even went to the twins ' birthday party . " Another case Carol wo n't forget is an infant who had gastroschisis . " Erica had been born three weeks early , and her intestines were outside her body ? we had to protect them by putting them in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate on her for about 10 days because they had to wait until the pressure within the abdomen decreased , which would allow an easier insertion of the intestines into the abdomen . Unfortunately Erica did n't have enough skin on her abdomen for a normal skin closure , so after the operation , she had to have five or six skin grafts . " Erica was in NICU for five months . She could n't breathe on her own and had to be put on a ventilator . And she got the life-threatening infections that we see in babies who are malnourished . It was so sad . Everything we did for her was so painful that we sometimes had to restrain her . I wondered whether we had broken her spirit . But she was a fighter . The day she finally looked at me and smiled , it made my whole week ! " When Erica was well enough to go to the children 's floor , I made a point of checking in on her regularly . Her mother lives three hours away in a mobile home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erica to her mother every week to let her know what was going on . " After eight months here , Erica went on to a rehabilitation center . Now , she is a delightful child ? one of our miracles . " How does Carol keep track of what becomes of all her little patients ? " Once a year we have a NICU graduate party , " she says . All our graduates ' and their parents , doctors , and nurses are invited , and we end up with several hundred people . It 's supposed to be for the kids , but it 's also for the staff so that we can see that what we do works . There is n't one of us who does n't look forward to that party . We need it to keep going , because we do have babies who do n't make it . " Carol finds it inspiring to see many of these children , who 'd been so sick , running around , happy , and healthy . " Unbelievable , when you think of the horrendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite their rough entry into the world . " Carol admits that burnout is a problem among some critical-care nurses . " We especially see burnout with nurses who work with the same baby and family for , say , nine months and then the outcome is bad , " she says . What keeps her centered ? " If you do n't have outside interests and make time for fun , " she says . " the job becomes your life and you do n't last for more than two or three years . Most of the time my job is finished when I leave to go home . "
