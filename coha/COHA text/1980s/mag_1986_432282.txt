 | Come with us now on a tour of Michele Lee 's bathroom . First of all you 'll notice the separate areas for her tub , her wardrobe and her makeup . And , of course , the redwood dry sauna . Maybe , in truth , " bath suite " is a better term , or perhaps " bath wing . " As you see , she 's got a stereo , a TV , a VCR , an exercise bike and enough stuff to run a hair salon . Why did she shell out almost $100,000 on all this ? Well , says the star of the prime-time soap " Knots Landing , " " I spend most of my time at home in my bathroom . It becomes my escape . " And did she really tear out the original master bathroom , another bedroom and its bath to make room for all this ? " Yes , " she says , " I wanted it to be as luxurious as I could get it and as functional as I could get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shower and the bay window behind the tub : is n't she worried that people wandering through the Los Angeles Country Club outside will look in ? Michele says no : " I make sure it steams up pretty good . " Party-size whirlpool : Welcome to Bathstyles of the Rich and Famous ? where there 's much more to going to the bathroom than going to the bathroom . Step into the brave new loo . As you can see , it comes in exciting new designer colors : taxicab yellow , Dresden blue and honeydew whisper . And is n't it spacious ? enough room for a party-size whirlpool and a cute little bidet in there with the standard equipment . Notice the new technological wrinkles on those old bathroom fixtures , like the faucet that gives a digital readout of the water temperature and the stereophonic tub that you can fill up with a command from your car phone . Of course , you 'll find all of this in the most lavish homes , but , increasingly , the unwashed are cleaning up their act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ed Pell of Kitchen &; Bath Business , Americans could invest $13 billion on bathrooms this year . " It 's certainly the glamour room , " says Gary Bradbury , publisher of the trade journal Kitchen &; Bath Design News . " It 's no longer the room down the hall . " Celebrity interviewer Robin Leach agrees . The host of " Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous , " who has a red Jacuzzi in his Connecticut home , jokes , " The bathroom has come out of the water closet . " When it comes to splashy lifestyles , entertainers always lead the way . Consider rock star Rod Stewart , whose guest bathroom has black-mirror tiles over every surface , including the toilet , and about 2,500 little white lights for a laserlike effect . Or former Beatle George Harrison , who has a toilet-seat lid that plays " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds . " For pure outlandishness , of course , no one surpasses Liberace , who has 25 bathrooms in his five homes . As the pianist leans back and soaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can gaze up from the sunken oval tub at a ceiling painted in imitation of the one that graces the Sistine Chapel . In the center , however , surrounded by rosy cherubs , is the face of @# @#  | Liberace ? three feet across and beaming . He also keeps an upright Baldwin piano in one bathroom " in case I want to tinkle . " But there is more to the hot new bathroom than showing off . With the widespread installation of whirlpools ? with their relaxing water agitation ? accompanied by stereo systems , the room often functions as a private getaway . The facilities have become so attractive that people now spend more time in their bathrooms and , says Roy Jacuzzi , who invented the first bathtub whirlpool in 1968 , " They 're entertaining more at home in the bathroom . " Other people now think of the bathroom as a kind of health spa . By knocking down a few walls and adding exercise equipment , they have transformed the room into a home gym . And whirlpools can provide hydrotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for your financial health . " It 's a selling point for the home , " says Elaine Petrowski of Kitchen &; Bath Design News . " You 're going to get back a large part of your investment . " Pillow-massage function : In the opulent bathroom , more than ever the tub has moved to center stage . " Large whirlpool baths with magnificent fixtures have really become the focal point , " says Gerald Paul of the design firm Paul Associates . The Kohler Co. sells 11 models of whirlpools ? costing from $650 to $6,000 ? made of cast iron , plastic , cultured marble or solid teak . Most exciting , however , are the new built-in tub toys . Take the Sensorium , the top-of-the-line whirlpool that American-Standard describes as " a total environment which turns the bath into a bathing experience . " For $25,500 you can get Sensorium with Ambiance , a microprocessor that will close the drain , choose your water temperature , fill the bath , dim the lights and turn on your bathroom stereo or TV ? all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the telephone . Then there 's the Bath Womb by Water Jet , which comes with a built-in stereo , reading stand and the special pillow-massage function . A cylindrical pillow attached to the domed end of the Bath Womb has its own jet , which sprays water and massages the neck . Continental touch : In the case of the humble faucet , modern technology has made the simple even easier . Earlier this year American-Standard introduced Ceramix Electronix ? " a faucet that takes its own temperature . " The faucet 's solarpowered digital readout ensures that " you no longer have to put your foot in and get scalded , " says American-Standard 's marketing manager Scott Atcheson . To jazz up the even humbler toilet , Kohler commissioned well-known ceramicists to create avant-garde patterns and textures for their Artists Editions models . In the world of sinks , Manhattan designer Sherle Wagner has combined ornate design with extraordinary materials , such as onyx , lapis lazuli and gold leaf , to produce the most baroque basins this side of the 18th century . The bidet has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it is a little-understood fixture . It does provide a Continental touch , however , and in today 's giant-size bathroom it fills the empty space next to the toilet over in the corner . All of this remodeling has flushed out a new school of interior decorators who concentrate almost exclusively on bathrooms . " I felt there was a need for someone specialized in state-of-the-art bathroom equipment , " says New Jersey interior designer Doris Bachmann , who switched to bathrooms three years ago and now creates about 50 ultrachic bathrooms a year . And , as the boom continues , even tony designers like Sherle Wagner ? who sells gold-leafcovered toilet-seat lids for $500 ? report that the bulk of their business comes from the middle and upper-middle classes , not the superrich . Clearly , for people in the bathroom business , these are heady days .
