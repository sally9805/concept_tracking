To counter criticism , a volley of civil rights initiatives <P> The public courtship began last month , when Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds toured the black communities in the rural Mississippi Delta to check into voting discrimination . With Jesse Jackson as his guide , the patrician Reynolds dined on catfish sandwiches and grits , listened to horror stories and , holding Jackson 's hand , sang We Shall Overcome . Then he returned to Washington and dispatched federal registrars to five Mississippi counties to register voters . It was a symbolic journey in a presidential campaign season : Reynolds , head of the Justice Department 's civil rights division , has been a key target of black leaders who have complained for the past two years that the Reagan Administration has been delinquent in enforcing civil rights laws . <P> The trip was just a start . Suddenly last week there was action everywhere as the Administration moved to counter increasing criticism from blacks and Hispanics . <P> Monday . The Justice Department launched the Administration 's first school-desegregation suit , charging that Alabama has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and universities .

" The Justice Department will also soon file suits against two school districts . <P> Tuesday . Major new amendments to the Fair Housing Act of 1968 , touted by Reagan as " an important step for civil rights , " were unveiled .

The legislation aims to increase the number of cases settled through conciliation and the number filed by the Government against brokers , landlords and rental agents . It would also set stiff new fines , up to $50,000 for first-time offenders . Reagan 's bill will compete in Congress with an existing fair-housing bill supported by most civil rights groups . <P> Wednesday . The Justice Department petitioned federal courts to intervene in two suits charging that redistricting plans in two Mississippi counties are racially discriminatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams counties on Aug. 2 . The department is also considering court action in eleven other counties . <P> Thursday . The President signed an Executive Order calling upon each federal agency with substantial procurement and grant-making authority to develop annual plans to assist minority businesses . <P> Friday . The Washington Post published a letter from Attorney General William French Smith , angry about an editorial in the paper that suggested the Administration 's " spurt of activity " was prompted by a calculated worry about the 1984 campaign . Protested Smith , citing Justice Department efforts to fight racial discrimination : " Since January 1981 , we have been vigorously enforcing civil rights laws . "
