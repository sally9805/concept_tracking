Strict laws against drunk driving may be causing an unwanted side effect . A new study by Purdue University researchers shows that after Ohio instituted a tough drunk-driving law making it more likely for offenders to be jailed and have their licenses suspended , the number of alcohol-related accidents fell by 20% . But at the same time , the number of hit-and-run incidents caused by intoxicated drivers rose by 8% . " The higher the penalty for drunk driving , " says Purdue Economist John Umbeck , a coauthor of the report , " the more there is to gain by leaving the scene . " <P> The study , which analyzed 500,000 accidents in Ohio from January 1982 to June 1983 , suggested that motorists facing severe punishment for drunk driving might be strongly inclined to cut out , especially if the penalty for fleeing the accident is scarcely harsher than that for causing it . One possible remedy : stiffen the laws against hit-and-run driving .                    @
