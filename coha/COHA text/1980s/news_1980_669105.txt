And it willbe the culmination of a hectic research effort aimed at improving truck technology . As with the auto industry , the effort began in earnest following the oil embargo days of 1973-74 , as truck manufacturers fought for more fuel economy and to maintain sales through two recessions. // Considering that most heavy-duty trucks are getting 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 miles to a gallon of diesel fuel , reaching six miles a gallon would mean a fuel saving of more than 70 percent. // A report on a recent test of an engine built by the Cummins Engine Company stated that the 72 , 000-pound truck " turned in an impressive 5. 25 miles per gallon average fuel economy " on a trip from Florida to California. // To reach this lofty level , US truck manufacturers are scrambling to modify engines , cut weight , make tires roll more efficiently , and even streamline the bodies of their trailers. // At the same time , they are being forced to comply with tougher air pollution and noise standards . But these standards comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50 , 000 to $80 , 000 on a vehicle provide all the pressure truck builders need to make the 18-wheelers more fuel efficient. // " Trucks are tools , " said Sheridan Brinley , spokesman for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association . " People buy them to perform a job , and looks are secondary . " Many trucks today travel 100 , 000 miles a year . Mr. Brinley explained . A 25 percent fuel savings on such a vehicle can mean savings of over $5 , 000 in dollar-a-gallon diesel fuel costs. // Also , truck experts point out , while six miles per gallon migh not seem like much , it is far more fuel efficient than a car , considering the weight involved . An automobile with an mpg of 24 may be six times as fuel efficient as the best truck . But it might only weigh 4 , 000 pounds , including pasengers . A truck and its cargo , meanwhile , often weights 80 , 000 pounds , or 20 times as much. // While truck and engine manufacturers work on the engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking some of the easier steps to save fuel . Many trucks have been carrying wind deflectors on top of their cabs for several years. // " There can cut wind drag up to 35 percent at 55 miles per hour , " Mr. Brinley said . " And they can mean a fuel savings of 2-to-6 percent said . " Any they can mean a fuel savings of 2-to-6 percent , depending on the type. " // And while steel-belted radial tires are becoming increasingly popular on automobiles , their reduced resistance to rolling almost makes them a necessity on trucks. // A truck that is ligher is also less resistant to roling . So manufacturers are taking weight off faster than a new member of Weight Watchers. // " Anything we can take out of the truck enables the operator to haul more payload and stay within legal weight limits , " said Walter May , senior vice-president for production and engineering for Mack Trucks Inc . If payload is not a problem , he added , less weight means the engine doesn ' t have to work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. May explained , Mack and other companies are trying to find as many places as possible to use something lighter than steel . " We ' re using aluminum and fiber glass in as many noncritical areas as possible , " he said . Fiber glass is being tried on many parts of the cab body , including the hood , fenders , doors , instrument panels , and battery boxes . " We ' re considering making the whole cab out of fiber glass , " he added. // Noting that the General Motors Chevrolet Division has announced fiber glass springs for its 1981 corvettes , James Cote , an engineer with the company ' s GMC Truck Division , expects the material will one day be used in truck springs. // But it is in the engines that manufacturers have the most room for innovation , and where the greatest fuel saving lie . Here , terms like turbocharging , turbocompounding , torsional isolation , and even ceramics are being bandied about by an energy-conscious industry. // Perhaps the most promising innovation is turbocompounding , a technique that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while taking much of what was formerly " waste " heat generated by the engine and using it to produce even more power . " The exhaust from the turbocharger is ducted to a low-pressure power turbine which is coupled to the engine crankshaft. // One of the effects of such measures is to reduce the amount of horsepower needed to move a truck. // " It takes less horsepower to drive a truck today than its used to , " said Carl Ahlers , assistant vice-president for research and engineering at Cummins Engine . " We think all the things going on in the marketplace are going to work to drive horsepower down. " // The never engines , explained Jerry Holmes , spokesman for the Detroit Diesel Allison division of General Motors , are designed to operate at a higher torque , which means they can reach their maximum power at a lower RPM revolutions per munite level . " This means you can pull heavier loads at slower engine speeds and your engine isn ' t doing as much work , " Mr. Holmes said. // " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means they don ' t need as many gears , " said Dario Sabatini , president of Dario ' s Diesel Service in Worcester , Mass . " Without so many gears the driver doesn ' t have to shift as often . " As a result , trucks with 10. 13 , or even 15 gears are expected to be replaced by those with eight or nine speeds. // One of the more interesting concepts in engine technology is still in the experimental stage  --  ceramic parts . So far , Cummins Engine is the only firm looking into this idea seriously , but it has its origins in an idea that is thousands of years old : a brick oven retains heat longer than a steel one. // Noting that 30 percent of an engine ' s heat is sent out the exhaust pipe and 35 percent goes to the cooling system , Mr. Ahlers points out that this " leaves only 35 percent that comes out as shaft work . . . so over the two-thirds of the heat is wasted . " By saving some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to produce as much original heat. // The primary drawback to full development of ceramic parts , or even a totally ceramic egine , Mr. Ahlers says , is stress. // " We have ceramics that can stand up to the heat , " he says . " But not up to the stresses of an engine . They just break up from the force of all the work they have to do. " // The truck industry has given itself some incentives to save fuel through the voluntary truck and bus fuel conservation program . Set up in 1975 , the program involves the Departments of Transportation and Energy , the Environmental Protection Agency , and the truck-building industry . It is an effort to coordinate resources and technology to promote fuel-saving advancements and driving techniques . The program has been saving about 100 , 000 gallons of fuel a day , Mr. Brinley of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association said. // //
