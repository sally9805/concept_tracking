You won ' t see any ads in the travel section for this vacation : three weeks on East 86th Street , Manhattan , featuring daily excursions to nearby parks , restaurants , and museums ; unlimited sofa-lounging and reading in bed ; Mets and Yankee games nightly on TV. // // It may sound odd , but our high-rise apartment proved the perfect vacation spot . We threw away the conventional definition of a vacation - a getaway - and left it to others to abandon hearth and home . Our territory would be the byways of our neighborhood. // We did no research for this vacation ; we followed no guidebooks . There were no planes to catch , suitcases to pack , or itineraries to plan . Instead , we threw away the alarm clock , put on the answering machine , and allowed ourselves to follow a different rhythm . There is no more glorious feeling , we quickly discovered , than to putter inside , while outside the world dashes by . And because our own pace slowed to a stroll , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed calm. // Ambling down an avenue or loitering near the East River , we were able to enjoy , as if for the first time , the flavors to be savored along each street : the monumental calm of Fifth Avenue , with its mansions and museums ; the elegance and dash of Madison ; the stately march of red and yellow tulips all along Park ; the bustle of Lexington ; the dusty clatter of construction between Third and York ; then the serene pace of East End Avenue and the river beyond. // We would pause before the quaint reserve of the red brick Queen Anne row houses tucked into the mews of Henderson Place ; wonder at the peculiar mixture of high-rises and brownstones in neighborhoods that seemed to be in a state of permanent transition ; shake our heads at the transformation of yet another home-style , family-run restaurant into a glitzy pastarria , all aluminum and glass. // Often , we would walk as far east as we could go , crossing East End Avenue , passing through the quiet , tree-lined entryway to Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to John Finley Walk , the promenade that overlooks the riverfront . It was easy to forget that thousands of cars were rushing unseen below us on the FDR Drive , carrying with them all of the hurried cares we had left behind. // Every evening , we would gaze at the darkening sky , and as the glimmering face of the water also began to darken , we would exclaim , ' ' What a marvelous city this is ! ' ' in exactly the tone we had used in Florence and Rome. // Sometimes we would fix our attention on the elegant length of a man-made wonder , the Triborough Bridge . Both my husband and I had just read the life story of its builder , Robert Moses , in Robert A. Caro ' s monumental biography , ' ' The Power Broker . ' ' We were so fascinated by Caro ' s monster-hero that one night we sought out the apartment house where Moses had lived on Gracie Square . Our prey proved elusive , however . We asked one doorman after another for remembrances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this neighborhood , at least , the famous are guaranteed their privacy , even after they are gone. // Each evening as we sat by the river , we would watch the passing show : There was the pale , lanky apprentice mime who would act out , in slow motion , his impression of the fledgling softball pitcher he had spotted the evening before . There were the picnickers , lounging on the grass as if to pose for a painting by a modern-day Seurat. // We , too , became characters in the show as we listened to the wheezing of runners , smiled at the proudly goo-goo-eyed new moms and dads , turned discreetly away from the caressing of the lovers , or nodded sympathetically at the slightly older moms and dads plopped nearby , with kids , softball gear , and gleaming new bicycles in tow. // One night fireworks erupted across the way in Queens - who knew where or why ? When boats passed by , we waved to the passengers and they waved back . The park and the river provided our live entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat. // Though we roamed no farther from home than a handful of blocks east , west , north , or south , we had no difficulty embarking on culinary tours of many cultures : Thai , Indian , Italian , Chinese , German , Hungarian , even down-home American . Because proximity can breed neglect , when the vacation began , we had not yet sampled the elegantly informal Thai addition to our neighborhood ; but the calm , sea-green , bistrolike setting beckoned , and by vacation ' s end we had become regulars , captivated by the fiery , aromatic flavors of ground chilies and peanuts and curry and ginger and garlic. // Every vacation thrives on the chance encounter , the accidental discovery . This one was no different . I happened to notice a small announcement in the newspaper that the Amateur Astronomers Association of New York was offering a special evening for anyone interested in gazing at the stars . And sure enough , on the appointed evening , we discovered right there , only a few steps from our usual spot by the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of oddly excited children , parents , and curious people like us. // I squinted into the metal eyepiece , already warm from the brows of other would-be observers and cried , ' ' What ' s that ? ' ' ' ' Arcturus , the sixth brightest star in the universe , ' ' calmly replied a kindly amateur astronomer . ' ' And that ? ' ' ' ' Oh , that ' s Mars . ' ' ' ' Really ? ' ' I asked in a tone of childlike awe . ' ' Oh , certainly . Yes - and look at this - ' ' he crouched to adjust the cylinder of the telescope . ' ' That is a double star , ' ' he explained . And then , holding back a smile , he changed the focus of the telescope once more and beckoned with a wave. // Could it be ? In the lens before me shone the hazy rings of - Saturn ! The halo circled round and round its distant orb while all the while I stood , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked from the heavens to the water , from the river ' s dappled blackness to the starry sky once more . Suddenly , all New York seemed awash with brightness and light . I had traveled around the universe , and I was home once more . Only then did I remember : I had never left. // //
