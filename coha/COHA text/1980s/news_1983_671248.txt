But the evidence , especially on health matters , is often described as " inconclusive , " forcing scientists to base their points of view almost as much on intuition as science. // Instead of answers , there is controversy embodying so many shades of gray that only ambiguity is left . When historians and philosophers of science listen to the cacophony , some conclude that science may be incapable of solving all these problems any time soon. // Many questions seem to defy the scientific method , an approach at its best when it examines straightforward relationships : If variable A is manipulated , what does it do to variable B ? Such procedures can , of course , be very difficult in their own ways , but in experimental terms they are clean , elegant. // " In general the simple problems have all been solved , " said David Hull , a philosopher at the University of Wisconsin who is president-elect of the Philosophy of Science Association . " The physicists came across some simple problems quite early . But in the social sciences and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // With the aid of Newton ' s laws of gravitational attraction , for instance , ground controllers can predict the path of a planetary probe with incredible accuracy . They do this by calculating - one at a time - gravitational tugs from each of the passing planets until the probe speeds beyond the edge of the solar system . It is a routine bit of mathematics . A much more difficult task is to calculate how two or three tugs work at once , since it adds variables to the problem. // The unknowns can grow until riddles are impossibly knotty . Because of the turbulent and fickle whorls of the earth ' s atmosphere , for instance , scientists for centuries have struggled in vain to predict the weather with precision. // This spectrum of explanatory power - from simple problems to those impossibly complex - has resulted in nicknames for fields of inquiry . " Hard " sciences such as astronomy , physics and chemistry are said to yield precise answers , whereas " soft " ones such as sociology and economics admit a greater degree of uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of scientific life sometimes lead to mild jealousy . All too often , according to Keith Steward Thomson , a biologist who is dean of the graduate school at Yale University , biologists and social scientists suffer what he calls " physics envy , " or a yearning for greater precision. // Despite the spectrum of complexity , the aim throughout the sciences is pragmatic - to tease unambiguous truths from the chaos of nature . Messy questions are thus often left to bedevil future scientists. // " The spectacle of a scientist locked in combat with the forces of ignorance is not an inspiring one if , in the outcome , the scientist is routed , " writes Sir Peter Medawar , a Nobel Prize winner in medicine . " That is why so many of the most important biological problems have not yet appeared on the agenda of practical research . " <> <> Early Victories Were Simple // This pragmatism is evident from the very start of the scientific revolution . All along , of course , pressing questions have been posed in wide-ranging areas of endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a mathematical point of view , were extremely simple. // In the 17th century the father of the revolution , Isaac Newton , watched an apple fall and wondered if the same force reached to the moon . He subsequently showed how gravity acts between any two heavenly bodies. // In the 18th century scientists successfully tackled more complex problems , involving many interactions instead of just those between two or three bodies . More triumphs came , especially in chemistry , when John Dalton discovered the laws of chemical combination. // A cutting edge in the 19th century was biology , a science that successfully investigated phenomena still more complex . Pasteur developed the germ theory of disease ; Darwin hit upon his theory of evolution , and Mendel discovered the laws of inheritance . <> <> Man Is the Hardest Subject // In our own century the force of the attack has expanded to bear upon the most complicated subject of all - the culture and mentality of man . Yet results are sometimes mixed . Eleven distinguished psychologists were recently asked to describe what each considered " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half . " Unfortunately , no two could agree on what stood out. // So too , practitioners of economics , sociology and anthropology often argue over what constitutes outstanding work . " Just contrast the quarrels over Margaret Mead with the situation of an early astronomer who could say , ' Just wait until next year and we ' ll see who ' s right , ' " Donald Campbell , a past president of the American Psychological Association , said . " A lunar eclipse is hard to argue with . It ' s more difficult to achieve consensus in the social sciences. " // Although the roots of science are pragmatic , in the 20th century there has been an explosion of urgent and complex questions that can not wait for better methods of attack . One is the geological fate of California . Yet even with the aid of computer technology , according to Dr. Allan Lindh , a California geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey , predicting earthquakes is " like using results at a race track to play the stock market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet the farm on it. " // Perhaps most difficult of all are the delicate questions of human health and how it might be harmed by dioxin , the pill , food additives or low-level radiation . The challenge is not only to define " health " in the first place but also to look for effects throughout a lifetime , possibly decades after exposure . William D. Ruckelshaus , the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency , recently said that cleaning up toxic dumps - a multibillion-dollar task - was easy compared to measuring the health risks . <> <> Intrinsic Limits May Exist // Unfortunately , the passage of time or the application of new technology such as bigger computers might not always aid the development of fledging sciences . There may be intrinsic limits . " Will the social sciences evolve to the model of accurate prediction like in physics or astronomy ? " asked Christoper Jencks , a professor of sociology at Northwestern University . " I doubt it ' s going to happen . There are too many variables. " // One escape from complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move down the hierarchy of matter to a place where interactions are more fundamental . Such an escape is known as reduction . For centuries biologists failed in their attempts to explain how life is transmitted , for example . But when the attack finally came on a chemical level , with the discovery 30 years ago of the molecular blueprint known as DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid , it yielded an explosion of answers. // In a similar way , psychology often slides down the ladder in search of hard and fast results . Freud and his followers said depression was a result of anger turned inward - a view that spawned decades of debate . In contrast , the search is now on for genes that contribute to depression. // A controversial reduction that has recently been proposed is known as sociobiology , which interprets human behavior in terms of evolutionary biology rather than social interaction . Siblings care for each other , in this view , because such concern helps insure the survival of a similar set of genes , not because of some culturally encouraged form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from complexity on the ground that important things can get ignored . In biology , according to Dr. Thomson , " some people got tired of studying how a cathedral works by looking at only the bricks . " A more synthetic approach , he says , is now casting light on such riddles as " the song of a warbler , the mating of newts or even the self-regulating processes of organ regeneration . " <> <> Physics Model May Not Apply // Other scientists say the urge to reduce can be myopic because it tries to force all sciences into the predictive pattern of physics . " Complex historial sciences can not fulfill the predictive model , but that does not make them any less scientific , " said Stephen Jay Gould , a paleontologist at Harvard University . " How could an evolutionary theorist hope to predict the course of future events when evolutionary direction depends so critically upon environmental changes - and when environmental change itself is so inordinately complex , partly random , and in any case not the subject matter of evolutionary theory ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from complexity . Newton , the man who set the standard for all who followed , believed nature was ultimately opaque to human understanding . He discovered laws that described the action of gravity , but he brushed aside the knotty question of why bodies attract each other in the first place . It was just too complex . So too , science throughout history has been profoundly pragmatic . It is always on the prowl for questions it can answer . As Arthur Koestler put it : " If politics is the art of the possible , research is surely the art of the soluble. " //
