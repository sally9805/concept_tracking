Time " delves the parallels in beauty 's brow , " wrote Shakespeare . Today he could wryly add , " So plastic surgeons to your very wish will bow . " Over the years , the cosmetic wizards have conjured many escapes from the ravages of age , from chemical peels to skin abrasion to surgical lifts . Now they are wielding a new magic wand : syringes filled with collagen . Injections of the whitish gel smooth away time-worn creases as well as acne and surgical scars . And at a relatively affordable price : treatments run $300 to $1,500 , about a third of the price of a typical face-lift . <P> Since 1981 , when the Food and Drug Administration gave the nod , more than 300,000 people have indulged themselves with collagen shots . Enthusiasts range from society matrons to aging baby-boomer executives to fitness freaks who are intent on looking their best . " Most people who have the treatments are in their late 30s to 50s and are still very active , " says Dr. Henry Roenigk , chairman of dermatology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept aging , but today they just do n't want to look old . The fact is , however , collagen does n't last forever . " <P> Collagen , which is used in cosmetic creams , is a natural protein found in connective tissue , including the skin and bone . The injectable variety , developed by the Collagen Corp . of Palo Alto , Calif. , is derived from the hides of cows . In a typical treatment , the collagen is inserted just under the skin in a series of ten to 15 shots . Used primarily to combat forehead furrows and the lines that extend from the nose to the lips , collagen fills in the space behind and around wrinkles and sags , much like the way air fills a balloon and makes its skin grow taut . The procedure , which stings slightly and can leave the face red for about a day , takes 15 min. to half an hour and can be completed during a lunch hour . " The nice thing about collagen is that the individual does n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic surgeon in Newport Beach , Calif . " When you have a face-lift , you have to go into hiding . " <P> The technique appeals especially to those who are afraid of cosmetic surgery or who are too young for a full face-lift . " I was starting to get lines , and they were not part of how I felt I should look , " said Marilyn Tschida , 44 , owner of a picture-framing store in West Palm Beach , Fla. , who had frown lines filled out last month . Mary Nielsen , an Oakland sales representative who says she is in her late 30s , decided to ease her laugh lines when " people started calling me ' Ma'am ' instead of ' Miss . ' " Michael Epstein , 32 , who runs eight miles a day and plays tennis twice a week , paid $800 for initial treatments in July . " I always had the feeling that I 'd be willing to do anything to improve my appearance , " says Epstein , who owns a singles club in Encino , Calif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't mind spending money doing it . " <P> Yet there are drawbacks . The benefits are temporary : the collagen breaks down and is absorbed by the skin in anywhere from three months to two years . Though patients are tested for allergic reaction beforehand , about one out of every 50 who pass the exam develops a delayed reaction to the shots , usually tiny bumps that disappear in six months . Some doctors also fear that repeated injections might compromise the body 's immune defense system and cause later illness .
