In real life , Shadoe Stevens is a dapper and thoughtful man who left a job as a disk jockey to go into the more lucrative field of advertising . But to millions of TV viewers in California , Texas and Arizona , he is Fred Rated , the wild-and-crazy huckster who has appeared in some 800 commercials for the Federated Group , a Los Angeles-based electronics chain . In Stevens ' wacky TV career , he has impersonated The Honeymooners ' Ralph Kramden and Miami Vice 's Sonny Crockett , played a man who gets attacked by rabid frogs and even starred as a Santa Claus who turns into a werewolf . His public appearances at Federated stores attract hundreds of autograph seekers . Most important , since his TV debut in 1982 , Federated 's sales have surged 80% , and the 16-year-old company has grown from 15 outlets to 60 . Says Marketing Vice President Gary Tobey : " He 's made us seem like a more fun place to shop . " <P> The success of Fred Rated and other weirdos like him has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with commercials that are goofy , whimsical and sometimes downright obnoxious . One of the pioneers in the field is Crazy Eddie , the New York-area consumer-electronics chain with the pitchman who raves about " insane " prices and " Christmas sales " in August . Instead of copying the slick style of the ad factories on Madison Avenue , local advertisers churn out low-budget affairs that they often write and produce themselves . Nothing is too ridiculous if it catches a viewer 's attention : announcers attack water beds with chain saws or dress up like gorillas and yell , " You 'll go bananas ! " In some cases , these homemade off- the-wall routines have caused a company 's business to increase 100% or more virtually overnight . Says Burton Manning , chairman of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency : " Silliness sells when you 're trying to get an ad to cut through the clutter . " To keep viewers from wandering into the kitchen during the station break , many businesses are relying on skits that might have been staged by a bunch of sixth-graders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss. , features nine car salesmen in matching sweatshirts , khaki pants and tennis shoes who stage an arrhythmic song-and-dance routine in the middle of an empty football stadium . While three of the performers pound out a funky beat on keyboard , drums and guitar , the other six do an out-of-step side-to-side shuffle . In between refrains , the various salesmen sing rap-style verses in which they boast about their prowess on the showroom floor . <P> Often the boss himself will grab the limelight and ham it up . Barry Ross , 43 , owner of Houston 's Superior Waterbeds , was watching a disk jockey tape a spot for his firm seven years ago when he got frustrated with the hireling 's laid-back style . Recalls Ross : " I wanted an irritant to wake somebody up during the early morning . " He grabbed the microphone and began wildly shouting out lines . " When the engineer played it back , " Ross says , " it sounded so good that I told the deejay to go home . " In one zany Fourth of July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a " sales explosion !
