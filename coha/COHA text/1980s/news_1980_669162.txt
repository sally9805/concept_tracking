The flare cought our jeep climbing on a narrow dirt road that threaded up the mountains outside Baneh , where a few days before , the rebels had stormed an Army garrison and pinned the soldiers into a corner with mortars and machine-gun fire. // But the garrison troops were far from helpless . Even though we were riding with no headlights , they knew we were there . Red tracers hummed angrily above the roof of the jeep . Their falling mortar shells had cratered the road. // That was when they were firing in the dark . Now the sky exploded stark white. // " Jump out quick ! " yelled the driver . It wasn ' t easy . Seven of us were crammed inside the jeep , four newsmen and three rebels , one badly injured . He was the first rebel to penetrate the Army garrison during the big assault , and when his Soviet-type Kalashnikov weapon jammed , the soldiers had blasted him with a grenade. // Somehow , we all scrambled into a nearby ravine. // The jeep was an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortars , but we were lucky . Instead of attacking us , the two Phantoms rocketed the village four times. // Traveling 100 miles that night , we reached the small town of Bukan and deposited the wounded Kurd there at a school converted into a hospital . Since clashes broke out between rebellious Kurdish separatists and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ' s regime a month ago , Bukan has been flooded with 40 , 000 refugees from Baneh , Saqqez , and several other mountain hamlets where fighting still continues. // No reliable casualty figures exist , but some observers say more Iranians , both Kurds and government forces , have died in the latest fighting than at any time during the revolution against the former Shah 17 months ago. // Since the Pahlavi dynasty ' s overthrow , Iranian Kurds along with many other ethnic minorities  --  Arabs , Turkomans , and Baluchis  --  have pressed the new regime for greater rights , but with little success. // Last summer , when the government first refused Kurdish demands for autonomy , the combined forces of all six Kurdish factions began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Ayatollah Khomeini ' s command , the Army struck back with heavy artillery and finally , when the fighting subsided , with mass executions. // A flimsy cease-fire negotiated last autumn collapsed in late April when the Army tried to March reinforcements into the towns of Saqqez and Sanandaj. // President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , in an attempt to justify the heavy bombardments in the Kurdish region , accused the Kurds of being " counterrevolutionaries " plotting with the United States , Iraqi President Saddam Hussein , and the Shah ' s former top-ranking military officers . For good measure , the Tehran newspapers also branded the Kurdish autonomists as " godless Marxists and Zionists. " // To verify these charges , this reporter spent five days in the Kurdish region of northwestern Iran , monitoring several routes into Iraq , plus interviewing countless refugees from the battle zones and rebel officers from each of the loosely knit factions fighting the government. // Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that neither the United States Central Intelligence Agency , Iraq , nor any other foreign power arms and finances the Kurds . However , scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains to help the Kurds. // In Baneh , for example , a commander of the Marxist-Leninist fedayeen ( guerrilla ) organization admitted that he was an Iranian turk from nearby eastern Azerbaijan province. // The guerrilla officer , who declined to identify himself , received military training the Lebanon at the camps of extremist Palestinians to fight against the Shah ' s regime . After the revolution , however , the fedayeen guerrillas went underground to escape the purges of Communists and other opponents to clerical rule. // His organization intends to use sabotage and terrorist tactics in the Kurdish region , Baluchistan , and the oil-rich region of Khuzestan , all places with troublesome minorities , to sweep out the turbaned mullahs ( Muslim teachers ) . // But in the Kurdish region , the fedayeen are the exception , not the rule . The other guerrilla groups  --  the Kurdish Democratic Party , the Komeleh , the Kurdish Mujahideen , and the supporters of Sheikh Ezzedine Hosseini and his brother Sheikh Jalal  --  claim to be pressing only for local autonomy. // Sheikh Ezzedine Hosseini , the religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that contrary to the government ' s charges , the political parties have no intention of forming a penniless , breakaway country together with the millions of Kurds in Iraq , Syria , Turkey , and the Soviet Union. // " We want to remain in Iran ; there ' s no question about that , " said the Sunni Muslim clergyman , whose high turban and stiff , long beard make him look like a figure on a Babylonian bas-relief . " Either President Bani-Sadr agrees to our autonomy demands or we fight . And if that ' s the case , the Kurds will fight until there is not one scrap of bread left. " // The Tehran government in the Kurdish political parties disagree , first of all , on the geographical boundaries of the Kurdish region . The Kurds say it includes the western portion of Azerbaijan , the provinces of Kordestan , Khermanshahr , and the northern tip of Ilam . But Mr. Bani-Sadr has only agreed to a limited autonony for small-sized Kordestan province. // The Kurds also want local councils to run provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting last summer , and the withdrawal of the revolutionary guard . The latter are fanatical and well-paid Islamic militants recruited from the Tehran slums. // " The Iranian Army can stay , but the revolutionary guards must go , " said the Sheikh . " They ' ve committed worse atrocities than anything seen in Vietnam . " A Kurd who had studied engineering in San Jose , Calif. , claimed the revolutionary guards killed his younger brother during a house-to-house search in Sanandaj. // The engineering student said so many Kurds were killed in the month-long government siege of Sanandaj that bodies were often hastily buried in the courtyards of private houses. // Sheikh Ezzedine Hosseini ' s relations with Ayatollah Khomeini are less than cordial . The Iranian revolutionary leader , who belongs to the rival Shiite Muslim sect , has issued a death warrant on the Sunni sheikh . Yet the failure of Tehran officials to gauge the support for the Kurdish sheikh may prove to be a mistake comparable to the former Shah ' s dismissal of the religious opposition to his throne. // In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the region , spray-on portraits of Ayatollah Khomeini , placed on walls by zealous revolutionary guards , have been scratched out . At Saqqez , a village nearly 25 percent destroyed by heavy artillery shelling , a reporter stopped outside a bombed-out mosque. // A man in a badly tied turban and the traditional baggy trousers climbed out of the rubble and thrust a heap of ashes into the newsman ' s hands . " What ' s this ? " he asked the interpreter. // " Pages from the Koran , " replied his interpreter . They tried to walk away . The old man grasped the reporter by the arm , hard . " Tell them , " he said , shaking with rage , " this is the Islam of Imam Khomeini. " // Although not all Kurds understand autonomy , the latest military offensive has left a smoldering resentment of Ayatollah Khomeini ' s regime in the region . Yet political experts argue that if President Bani-Sadr allowed an autonomous Kurdish state it might incite similar revolts among Iran ' s Baluchis , Arabs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremist clergymen on the ruling Revolutionary Council in Tehran are pushing President Bani-Sadr in to a no-win confrontation with the Kurds in order to topple his flimsy government. // The Kurds could drag out a guerrilla war for many months but , according to some military officials , never win . During the Shah ' s regime , Kurdish guerrillas received training and support from Moscow ' s satellite South Yemen and from the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , both of which now are courting Iran ' s revolutionary government. // Even Iran ' s quarrelsome neighbor , Iraq , hesitates to arm the Iranian Kurds  --  for an autonomous Kurdish state across the border might rekindle a similar rebellion among Iraq ' s own warlike Kurds , who total one-third of the country ' s population. // Nor would clandestine aid arrive from Western governments , as Tehran officials charge . One political observer explained , " The US , Britain , and the others only have one preoccupation , and that ' s to free the hostages. " // Faced with choosing between the fundamentalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sorbonne-educated President . In diplomatic circles , Mr. Bani-Sadr is viewed as sufficiently Westernized to back a negotiated settlement to the hostage crisis. // " So in the meantime , " added the political observer , " the US and Europe are willing to overlook Bani-Sadr ' s actions in Kurdistan. " // Without outside aid against one of the still most formidable armies in the Middle East , the Kurdish rebellion will be crushed . But both the Kurds and President Bani-Sadr realize that the government itself can win only an all-out civil war. // Yet such an unpopular move might speed Mr. Bani-Sadr ' s own downfall. // //
