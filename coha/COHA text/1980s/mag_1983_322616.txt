J.F.K. 's Legacy <P> To the Editors : <P> The greatness of John F. Kennedy does not lie in his accomplishments but in his ability to inspire ordinary men to believe that they could make the world better . Kennedy 's death was a tragedy because it denied Americans the chance to find out if we really were capable of improving life on this earth . <P> Ann J. Gould Cranston , R.I. <P> If Kennedy is mostly a myth , he is a myth our country needed and will continue to need . <P> <P> Sally Hill Montgomery , Ala . <P> <P> On Nov. 22 , 1963 , I was twelve and my fiance was two . For me , Kennedy 's death was a shattering experience that she can not completely share . When I told her that John Jr . had saluted his father 's casket , the gesture meant nothing to her . Yet that little boy 's salute still stirs me . For the rest of my life , Kennedy 's photograph will hang in my home . But I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> <P> Jack de Golia Yellowstone National Park , Wyo . <P> <P> Perhaps the best assessment of President Kennedy is embodied in the signs carried by civil rights activists in 1962-63 reading MORE COURAGE , LESS PROFILE . Those placards referred to Kennedy 's book Profiles in Courage . The sooner we accept the low estate of Kennedy 's accomplishments , vision , courage and moral character , the faster we will stop deceiving ourselves . <P> <P> William W. Hassler Annandale , Va . <P> <P> Why , after 20 years , do we continue to hope for a different end to the story ? <P> <P> Robert W. Easter San Diego <P> In your reference to the Presidential Performance Study , I notice that you omitted Dwight Eisenhower from the list of " above-average " Presidents . As director of that survey of historians , I know that Eisenhower came out eleventh while Kennedy ranked 13th . <P> <P> Robert K. Murray Pennsylvania State University University Park , Pa . <P> <P> The urge to reassess the Kennedy myth is understandable . But for those of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up " in the huts and villages of half the globe , " often with a picture of J.F.K. on the mud wall , the legend is stirring and meaningful . Kennedy can not be measured by his national accomplishments alone . He belongs to a larger world . <P> <P> Sabastian Devasia Bocholt , West Germany <P> Grenada Debate <P> In your discussion of what constitutes aggression among nations Nov. 14 , you fail to distinguish between indirect aggression and revolution . Practically all revolutions have some sort of foreign support . I can hear George III screaming about a coup d ' tat in the American colonies where insurgents were acting as surrogates for the French . <P> <P> Saul Sands Hofstra University Hempstead , N. Y. <P> <P> I was stunned when I heard we invaded a sovereign state without provocation . I am more stunned as I see my friends , who , caught up in the headiness of a military victory , have become apologists for our invasion . When the thrill of combat subsides , I hope this adventure will become the last instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Custer and his slaughter of the Indians . In the future , I urge that we have respect for all life , Cuban as well as Grenadian as well as American . <P> <P> Bob Schmidt Houston
