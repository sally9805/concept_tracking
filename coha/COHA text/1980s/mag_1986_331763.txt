A transvestite famous for offering sexual services to prison inmates . A woman who has risked madness , and at least temporarily succumbed to it , by volunteering to abstain from TV for a month . A clairvoyant , a mafioso , a crusader on a hunger strike until people stop hunting birds , a troupe of midgets who make up the world 's smallest Spanish-dance ensemble . <P> In short , it is business as usual around the television show We Are Proud to Present , which provides a few minutes of celebrity to the unusual or notorious . On the face of it , Pippo ( Marcello Mastroianni ) and Amelia ( Giulietta Masina ) , would seem to fit right in . Back in the ' 40s they were a minor but prosperous dance team , imitating the high romantic style of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in provincial Italian nightclubs and variety houses . Pippo and Amelia are long retired , but their one-shot TV comeback will be a treat for old fans and an astonishment to the younger set , especially if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lesser public humiliation . <P> Actually , they are misfits in modern show biz , maybe in the modern world . Their routine may not have been much , just a modest impression of a unique and immortal creation . But in Pippo and Amelia 's day , performers prospered because they were willing to do the hard work of polishing an artful act , not because they had the momentary nerve to commit an outrageous one . Besides , after they have endured the indifference of the youthful production staff and the chaos of rehearsal and performance ( there is a power failure just as they begin their act , and a leg cramp causes Pippo to fall in the middle of it ) , we see that , modest though their talents are , Pippo and Amelia had , and still have , a gift . It is the capacity to provide something universal and necessary , the romantic gesture . That grace may or may not be a vanishing one , but at least " Ginger &; Fred " are called to their work by something higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fellini , who like his stars is in his 60s , is copping a generational plea : " Our kitsch is better than your kitsch . " Maybe he means for us to see the faltering but brave Amelia and Pippo as surrogates for himself , still worthy of sober interest , maybe even moral admiration , although the headlines now go to younger directorial stars . Certainly he insists on pumping out more of the " Felliniesque , " his trademark blend of the grotesque and the surreal , than we need to get his point that TV is vulgar and coarsening . More moving is his presentation of two carefully imagined archetypes of aging . Masina 's Amelia is a woman grown more emotionally compact with the years , defending herself against their onslaught with a sort of neat , perky reserve . Mastroianni 's Pippo represents the opposite extreme , vulnerable dishevelment . She wins sympathy by asking no favors ; he gains it by begging for it . These are lovely performances , observant , original and infinitely appealing . When we , and Fellini , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelm what he really has to say ; instead , it makes a useful contrast to simpler truths , and makes us grateful for them , as we are in Ginger &; Fred .
