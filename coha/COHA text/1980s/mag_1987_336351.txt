As bereaved relatives huddled in shock and grief at Detroit Metropolitan Airport last month after the Northwest Airlines crash that killed 156 people , the Rev. John Irish , a Roman Catholic priest , was on hand to console them . And , apparently , to con them . Last week Detroit authorities said that Irish , who was dressed in a black suit and clerical collar , was actually a veteran ambulance chaser posing as a priest to steer business to a Florida lawyer named Ronald Brimmell . Says Wayne County Sheriff Robert Ficano : " He would try to win the confidence of victims ' families , and then say , ' I have this friend who is an attorney . . . ' " <P> Ficano said the good father has been observed at disaster sites in at least seven other states . Although Irish has not been charged with a crime and Brimmell denies using anyone to solicit business , Detroit authorities are investigating whether the " priest " committed fraud .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
