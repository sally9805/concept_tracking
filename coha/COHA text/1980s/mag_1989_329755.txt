In the 1980s the minimum wage has really lived up to its name . Since it was last raised to $3.35 an hour in 1981 , inflation has eroded its purchasing power by 27% . Meanwhile , the Reagan era became famous for skyrocketing maximum wages as greed became fashionable throughout the land . Frustrated by Congress 's repeated failures to improve the national standard for the lowest- paid employees , eleven states set higher minimums of their own . Even fast- food chains often find themselves bidding $6 an hour and up for workers who scoff at the minimum wage as " chump change . " <P> Last week the White House joined with congressional Democrats to give a raise to those at the bottom of the scale . Starting next April , the lowest- paid workers will receive $3.80 an hour , to be followed by a raise to $4.25 a year later . That represents a concession by the President , who wanted the increase phased in over three years . But congressional Democrats also gave ground by agreeing to an idea they had fiercely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for teenage workers . The training wage , which can be paid to a worker only during his first six months on the job , will be $3.23 , rising to $3.61 in 1991 . <P> Congressional Democrats and their labor allies had repeatedly been thwarted in their attempts to legislate a higher minimum . Just last June , Bush vetoed an increase to $4.55 an hour . He was responding to arguments from business that a higher minimum would force 200,000 workers to lose their jobs . The logjam broke two weeks ago , however , when AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland suggested a compromise plan to the White House . <P> &; House Republicans suggested that Bush take Kirkland 's proposals seriously . Fighting the hike had become embarrassing for Republican lawmakers since they had energetically backed a cut in the capital gains tax that would mainly benefit wealthy investors . They warned that another veto might be overridden . " We do n't need to be known as the party that squeezed the last penny out of the minimum wage , " said Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House by a vote of 382 to 37 . Quick approval is expected in the Senate , and the President could sign the bill by Thanksgiving . <P> But what will the higher minimum wage really mean to the working poor ? Though economists are skeptical about business 's claims that the increase will lead to large numbers of lost jobs , they also question whether it will do much to improve the lot of low-wage workers . Only about 4 million of the nation 's 60 million hourly workers make the minimum wage or less , about 40% of them teenagers . The $6,968 earned annually by a full-time minimum-wage employee is $2,467 less than the federal poverty line for a family of three . Even when the new raise goes fully into effect , such employees will earn only $8,840 a year . But only a handful of minimum-wage earners are the sole supports of their families . Moreover , many live in households that receive such Government assistance as food stamps , rent subsidies and Medicaid.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
