" Well , I 'm here on the fire claim , " I said , wondering if she mistakenlyassumed that " arson " and " fire " were interchangeable terms . " Oh . Mr. Wood is n't in yet , but he should be here momentarily , " she said . The braces infused her speech with a sibilance that amused her when she heard herself . " Can I get you some coffee while you wait ? " I shook my head . There was one chair available and I took a seat , amusing myself by leafing through a brochure on the molybdenum work rack designed specifically for metallizing alumina at 1450  --  C in a bell-style hydrogen furnace . These people had about as many laughs as I do at home , where a prime source of entertainment is a textbook on practical aspects of ballistics , firearms , and forensic techniques . Through a doorway to my left , I could see some of the office staff , casually dressed and busy , but glum . I did n't pick up any sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't generate the kind of good-natured bantering I 'm accustomed to with California Fidelity . Two desks were unoccupied , bare of equipmentor accouterments . Some attempt had been made to decorate for Christmas . There was an artificial tree across the room from me , tall and skeletal , hung with multicolored ornaments . There did n't seem to be any lights strung on the tree , which gave it a lifeless air and only pointed up the uniformity of the detachable limbs stuck into pre-bored holes in the aluminum shaft . The effect was dispiriting . From the information I 'd been given , Wood/Warren grossed close to fifteen million bucks a year , and I wondered why they would n't pop for a live pine . Heather gave me a self-conscious smile and began to eat . Behind her was a bulletin board decorated with garlands of tinsel and covered with snapshots of the family and staff . H  --  A  --  P  --  P  --  Y H  --  O  --  L  --  ID  --  A  --  Y  --  Swas spelled out in jaunty store-bought silver letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , indicating the collage . By then , she had a mouth full of breakfast croissant , but she managedassent , holding a hand in front of her mouth to spare me the sight of her masticated food . " Help yourself . " Most of the photographs were of company employees , some of whom I 'd seen on the premises . Heather was featured in one , her fair hair much shorter , her face still framed in baby fat . The braces on her teeth probably represented the last vestige of her teens . Wood/Warrenp11must have hired her right out of high school . In one photograph , four guys in company coveralls stood in a relaxed group on the front doorstep . Some of the shots were stiffly posed , but for the most part they seemed to capture an aura of goodwill I was n't picking up on currently . The founder of the company , Linden " Woody " Wood , had died two years before , and I wondered if some of the joy had gone out of the place with his demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait that looked like it was taken at the family home . Mrs. Wood was seated in a French Provincial chair . Linden stood with his hand resting on his wife 's shoulder . The five grown children were ranged around their parents . Lance I 'd never met before , but I knew Ash because I 'd gone to high school with her . Olive , older by a year , had attended Santa Teresa High briefly , but had been sent off to a boarding school in her senior year . There was probably a minor scandal attached to that , but I was n't sure what it was . The oldest of the five was Ebony , who by now must be nearly forty . I remembered hearing that she 'd married some rich playboy and was living in France . The youngestwas a son named Bass , not quite thirty , reckless , irresponsible , a failed actor and no-talent musician , living in New York City , the last I 'd heard . I had met him briefly eight years before through my exhusband , Daniel , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . I was n't sure what the story was on Lance . Seated across his desk from him sixty-six minutes later , I began to pick up a few hints . Lance had breezed in at 9:30 . The receptionist indicated who I was . He introduced himself and we shook hands . He said he had a quick phone call to make and then he 'd be right with me . I said " Fine " and that was the last I saw of him until 10:16 . By then , he 'd shed his suit coat and loosened his tie along with the top button of his dress shirt . He was sitting with his feet up on the desk , his face oily-looking under the fluorescent lights . He must have been in his late thirties , but he was n't aging well . Some combination of temper and discontent had etched lines near his mouth and spoiled the clear brown of his eyes , leaving an impression of a man beleaguered by the Fates . His hair was light brown , thinning on top , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business about the phone call was bullshit . He struck me as the sort of man who pumped up his ownp12sense of importance by making people wait . His smile was self-satisfied , and the energy he radiated was charged with tension . " Sorry for the delay , " he said . " What can I do for you ? " He was tipped back in his swivel chair , his thighs splayed . " I understand you filed a claim for a recent fire loss . " " That 's right , and I hope you 're not going to give me any static over that . Believe me , I 'm not asking for anything I 'm not entitled to . " I made a noncommittal murmur of some sort , hoping to conceal the fact that I 'd gone on " fraud alert . " Every insurance piker I 'd ever met said just that , right down to the pious little toss of the head . I took out my tape recorder , flicked it on , and set it on the desk . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " That 's fine . " I directed my next few remarks to the recorder , establishing my name , the fact that I worked for California Fidelity , the date and time of the interview , and the fact that I was speaking to Lance Wood in his capacity as president and CEO of Wood/Warren , the address of the company , and the nature of the loss . " Mr. Wood , you do understand that this is being taped , " I said for the benefit of the record . " Yes . " " And do I have your permission to make this recording of the conversation we 're about to have ? " " Yes , yes , " he said , making that little rolling hand gesture that means " Let 's get on with it . " I glanced down at the file . " Can you tell me the circumstances of the fire that occurred at the Wood/Warren warehouse at 606 Fairweatheron December nineteenth of this year ? " He shifted impatiently . " Actually , I was out of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The telephone intercom buzzed and he snatched up the receiver , barking at it like a dog . " Yes ? " There was a pause . " Well , goddamn it , put her through . " He gave me a quick look . " No , wait a minute , I 'll take it out there . " He put the phone down , excused himself brusquely , and left the room . I clicked off the recorder , mentally assessing the brief impression I 'd had of him as he passed . He was getting heavy in the waist and his gabardine pants rode up unbecomingly , his shirt sticking to the center of his back . He smelled harshly of sweat  --  not that clean animal scent thatp13comes from a hard workout , but the pungent , faintly repellant odor of stress . His complexion was sallow and he looked vaguely unhealthy . I waited for fifteen minutes and then tiptoed to the door . The receptionarea was deserted . No sign of Lance Wood . No sign of Heather . I moved over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of someone passing into the rear of the building who looked very much like Ebony , but I could n't be sure . A woman looked up at me . The name plate on her desk indicated that she was Ava Daugherty , the office manager . She was in her late forties , with a small , dusky face and a nose that looked as if it had been surgically tampered with . Her hair was short and black , with the glossy patina of hair spray . She was unhappy about something , possibly the fact that she 'd just cracked one of her bright-red acrylic fingernails . " I 'm supposed to be meeting with Lance Wood , but he 's disappeared . Do you know where he went ? " " He left the plant . " She was licking the cracked nail experimentally , as if the chemistry of her saliva might serve as adhesive . " He left ? " " That 's what I said . " " Did he say how soon he 'd be back ? " " Mr. Wood does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you 'd like to leave your name , I 'm sure he 'll get back to you . " A voice cut in . " Something wrong ? " We both looked up to find a dark-haired man standing in the doorwaybehind me . Ava Daugherty 's manner became somewhat less antagonistic . " This is the company vice-president , " she said to me . And to him , " She 's supposed to be in a meeting with Lance , but he left the plant . " " Terry Kohler , " he said to me , holding out his hand . " I 'm Lance Wood 's brother-in-law . " " Kinsey Millhone , from California Fidelity , " I said , shaking hands with him . " Nice to meet you . " His grip was hard and hot . He was wiry , with a dark moustache and large , dark eyes that were full of intelligence . He must have been in his early forties . I wondered which sister he was married to . " What 's the problem ? Something I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was doing there and the fact that Lance Wood had abandoned me without a word of explanation.  | " Why do n't I show you the warehouse ? " he said . " At least you can go ahead and inspect the fire scene , which I 'm assuming is one of your responsibilities . " " I 'd appreciate that . Is anybody else out here authorized to give me the information I need ? " Terry Kohler and Ava Daugherty exchanged a look I could n't decipher . " You better wait for Lance , " he said . " Hold on and I 'll see if I can find out where he went . " He moved toward the outer office . Ava and I avoided small talk . She opened her top right-hand drawer and took out a tube of Krazy Glue , ignoring me pointedly as she snipped off the tip and squeezed one clear drop on the cracked fingernail . She frowned . A long dark hair was caught in the glue and I watched her struggle to extract it . Idly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a languid discussion about the problem before them . " Now maybe the calculation is off , but I do n't think so , " one was saying . " We 'll find out , " someone interjected . All three men laughed . " The question came up . . . oh , this has occurred to me many times . . . What would it take to convert this to a pulse power supply for the main hot cell ? " " Depends on what your pulsing frequency is . " " About ten hertz . " " Whoa . " " Anything that would allow you to modulate a signal away that was being influenced by the juice going through the susceptors . You know , power on for nine-tenths of a second , off for a tenth . Take measurements ... " " Um  --  hum . On for a half a second , off for a tenth of a second . You ca n't really do it easily , can you ? " " The PID controller could send the output that fast . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the VRT setup itself , whether that would follow it . . . " I tuned them out again . They could have been plotting the end of the world for all I knew . It was another ten minutes before Terry Kohler reappeared . He was shaking his head in apparent exasperation.  | " I do n't know what 's going on around here , " he said . " Lance had to go out on some emergency and Heather 's still away from her desk . " He held up a key ring . " I 'll take you over to the warehouse . Tell Heather I 've got these if she shows up . " " I should get my camera , " I said . " It 's with my handbag . " He tagged along patiently while I moved back to Lance Wood 's office , where I retrieved the camera , tucked my wallet in my tote , and left my handbag where it was . Together we retraced a path through the reception room and the offices beyond . Nobody actually looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , like those portraits where the eyes seem to move . The assembly work was done in a large , well-ventilated area in the back half of the building with walls of corrugated metal and a floor of concrete . We paused only once while Terry introduced me to a man named John Salkowitz . " John 's a chemical engineer and consulting associate , " Terry said . " He 's been with us since sixty-six . You have any questions about high temperature processing , he 's the man you want to ask . " Offhand , I could n't think of one  --  except maybe about that pulse power supply for the main hot cell . That was a poser . Terry was moving toward the rear door , and I trotted after him . To the right , there was a double-wide rolling steel door that could be raised to accommodate incoming shipments or to load finished units ready for delivery . We went out into the alleyway , cutting through to the street beyond . " Which of the Wood sisters are you married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school with Ash . " " Olive , " he said with a smile . " What 's your name again ? " I told him and we chatted idly for the remainder of the short walk , dropping into silence only when the charred skeleton of the warehouse loomed into view.  |p16It  took me three hours to examine the fire scene . Terry went through the motions of unlocking the front door , though the gesture seemed ludicrous given the wreckage the fire had left . Most of the outer shell of the building remained upright , but the second story had collapsed into the first , leaving a nearly impenetrable mass of blackened rubble . The glass in the first-floor windows had been blown out by the heat . Metal pipes were exposed , many twisted by the weight of the walls tumbling inward . Whatever recognizable objects remained were reduced to their abstract shapes , robbed of color and detail . When it became apparent that I was going to be there for a while , Terry excused himself and went back to the plant . Wood/Warren was closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said if I was finishedsoon enough , I was welcome to stop by and have some punch and Christmas cookies . I had already taken out my measuring tape , notebook , sketch pad and pencils , mentally laying out the order in which I intended to proceed . I thanked him , scarcely aware of his departure . I circled the perimeter of the building , noting the areas of severest burning , checking the window frames on the first floor for signs of forced entry . I was n't sure how quickly the salvage crew would be coming in , and since there was no apparent evidence of arson , I did n't feel California Fidelity could insist on a delay . Monday morning , I would do a background check on Lance Wood 's financial situation just to make sure there was n't any hidden profit motive for the fire itself .. . a mere formality in this case , since the fire chief had already ruled out arson in his report . Since this was probably the only chance we 'd have to survey the premises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four exposures each . As nearly as I could tell , the probable point of origin of the fire was somewhere in the north wall , which seemed consistent with the theory of an electrical malfunction . I 'd have to check the wiring diagramp17from the original blueprints , but I suspected the fire chief had done just that in coming up with his analysis . The surface of charred wood bore the typical pattern of crevices known as " alligatoring , " the deepestcharring and the smallest check in the pattern localized in this rear portion of the building . Since hot gases rise and fire normally sweeps upward , it 's usually possible to track the course of the flames , which will tend to rise until an obstacle is encountered , then project horizontally , seeking other vertical outlets . Much of the interior had been reduced to ashes . The load-bearing walls remained , as black and brittle as cinder . Gingerly , I picked my way through the char-broiled junk , making a detailed map of the ruins , noting the degree of burning , general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered had been painted with the black and ashen pallor of extreme heat . The stench was familiar : scorched wood , soot , the sodden odor of drenched insulation , the lingering chemical aroma of ordinary materials reduced to their elements . There was some other odor as well , which I noted , but could n't identify . It was probably connected to materials stored there . When I 'd called Lance Wood the day before , I 'd requested a copy of the inventory sheets . I 'd review those to see if I could pinpoint the source of the smell . I was n't crazy about having to inspect the fire scene before I 'd had a chance to interview him , but I did n't seem to have much choice , now that he 'd disappeared . Maybe he 'd be back for the office Christmas party and I could pin him down then about an appointment first thing Monday morning . At 2:00 P.M. , I packed my sketch pad away and brushed off my jeans . My tennis shoes were nearly white with ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , I was reasonably content with the job I 'd done . Wood/Warren was going to have to get several contractors ' estimates , and those would be submitted to CF along with my recommendationregarding payment of the claim . Using the standard rule , I was guessing five hundred thousand dollars replacement cost , with additional payment for the inventory loss . The Christmas party was indeed in progress . The festivities were centered in the inner offices where a punch bowl had been set up on a drafting table . Desks had been cleared and were covered with platters of cold cuts , cheeses , and crackers , along with slices of fruitcake and homemade cookies . The company employees numbered about sixty , sop18the noise level was substantial , the general atmosphere getting looser and livelier as the champagne punch went down . Some sort of Reggae version of Christmas carols was being blasted through the intercom system . There was still no sign of Lance Wood , but I spotted Heather on the far side of the room , her cheeks rosy with wassail . Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . When he reached me , he leaned down close to my ear . " We better get your handbag before this gets out of control , " he said . I nodded vigorously and inched my way behind him through the reception area to Lance 's office . The door was standing open and his desk was being used as a bar . Liquor bottles , ice , and plastic glasses were arranged across the surface , with several people helping themselves to both the booze and the comfort of the boss 's furniture . My handbag had been tucked into a narrow slot between a file cabinet and a bookcase jammed with technical manuals . I put away my camera and sketch pad , hefting the bag onto my right shoulder . Terry offered to fetch me some punch , and after a moment of hesitation , I agreed . Hey , why not ? My first impulse was to leave as soon as I could gracefully extricate myself . I do n't generally do well in group situations , and in this instanceI did n't know a soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nowhere else to go . This might be the extent of my holiday celebration , and I thought I might as well enjoy it . I accepted some punch , helped myself to cheese and crackers , ate some cookies with pink and green sugar on top , smiled pleasantly , and generally made myself amenable to anyone within range . By 3:00 , when the party was really getting under way , I excused myself and headed out the door . I had just reached the curb when I heard someone call my name . I turned . Heather was moving down the walk behind me , holding out an envelope embossed with the Wood/Warren logo . " I 'm glad I caught you , " she said . " I think Mr. Wood wanted you to have this before you left . He was called away unexpectedly . This was in my out box . " " Thanks . " I opened the flap and peered at the contents : inventory sheets . " Oh great , " I said , amazed that he 'd remembered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Monday and set up a time to talk to him . "  | " Sorry about today , " she said . " Merry Christmas ! " She waved and then moved back to the party . The door was now propped open , cigarettesmoke and noise spilling out in equal parts . Ava Daugherty was watching us , her gaze fixed with curiosity on the envelope Heather 'd given me , which I was just tucking into my handbag . I returned to my car and drove back into town . When I stopped by the office , I passed the darkened glass doors of California Fidelity . Like many other businesses , CF had shut down early for Christmas Eve . I unlocked my door , tossed the file on my desk , and checked for messages . I put a call through to the fire chief for a quick verification of the information I had , but he , too , was gone . I left my number and was told he probably would n't return the call until Monday . By 4:00 , I was back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where I stayed for the entire weekend . Christmas Day I spent alone , but not unhappily . The day after that was Sunday . I tidied my apartment , shopped for groceries , made pots of hot tea , and read . Monday , December 27 , I was back in harness again , sitting at my desk in a poinky mood , trying to wrestle the fire-scene inspection into a coherent narrative . The phone rang . I was hoping it was Mrs. Brunswick at the bank , calling back to tell me the five-thousand-dollar snafu had been cleared up . " Millhone Investigations , " I said . " Oh hi , Kinsey . This is Darcy , next door . I just wondered when I could pop over and pick up that file . " " Darcy , it 's only ten-fifteen ! I 'm working on it , okay ? " Please note : I did not use the " F " word , as I know she takes offense . " Well , you do n't have to take that tone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be ready yet , but he says he wants to review the file first anyway . " " Review the file before what ? " " I do n't know , Kinsey . How am I supposed to know ? I called because there 's a note in the action file on my desk . " " Oh , your action ' file . You should have said so before . Come pick the damn thing up . " Ill temper and intuition are not a good mix . Whatever inconsistency was nagging at me , I could hardly get a fix on it with Darcy breathingp20down my neck . My first act that morning had been to fill out a form for the Insurance Crime Prevention Unit , asking for a computer check on Lance Wood . Maybe at some point in the past I 'd come across a previous fire claim and that 's what was bugging me . The computer check would n't come back for ten days , but at least I 'd have covered my bases . I adjusted the tabs on my machine , typed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date , and time of loss . When Darcy arrived to pick up the file , I spoke without looking up . " I dropped the film off at Speedee-Foto on my way in . They 'll have prints for me by noon . I have n't had a chance to talk to Lance Wood or the fire chief yet . " " I 'll tell Mac , " she said , her tone cool . Oh well , I thought . She 's never been a pal of mine anyway . As there was no slot or box where unspecified hunches could be typed in , I kept my report completely neutral . When I finished , I rolled it out of the machine , signed it , dated it , and set it aside . I had an hour before I could pick up the photographs , so I cleaned up the sketch of the watehouse layout and attached that to the report with a paper clip . The phone rang . This time it was Andy . " Could you step into Mac 's office for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best not to sass the CF claims manager . " Sure , but I wo n't have the pictures for another hour yet . " " We understand that . Just bring what you 've got . " I hung up , gathered up the report and the sketch , locked the office behind me and went next door . What 's this " we " shit ? I thought . The minute I stepped into Mac 's office , I knew something was wrong . I 've know Maclin Voorhies since I started working for CaliforniaFidelity nearly ten years ago . He 's in his sixties now , with a lean , dour face . He has sparse gray hair that stands out around his head like dandelion fuzz , big ears with drooping lobes , a bulbous nose , and small black eyes under unruly white brows . His body seems misshapen : long legs , short waist , narrow shoulders , arms too long for the average sleeve length . He 's smart , capable , stingy with praise , humorless , and devoutly Catholic , which translates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown . I 've never seen him smoke a cigar , but he 's usually chewing on a stub , the resultant tobacco stains tarnishinghis teeth to the color of old toilet bowls.  |p21I  took my cue not so much from his expression , which was no darker than usual , but from Andy 's , standing just to his left . Andy and I do n't get along that well under the best of circumstances . At forty-two , he 's an ass-kisser , always trying to maneuver situations so that he can look good . He has a moon-shaped face and his collar looks too tight and everything else about him annoys me , too . Some people just affect me that way . At that moment he seemed both restless and smug , studiously avoiding eye contact . Mac was leafing through the file . He glanced over at Andy with impatience . " Do n't you have some work to do ? " " What ? Oh sure . I thought you wanted me in this meeting . " " I 'll take care of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Andy murmured something that made it sound like leaving was his big idea . Mac shook his head and sighed slightly as the door closed . I watched him roll the cigar stub from one corner of his mouth to the other . He looked up with surprise , as if he 'd just realized I was standing there . " You want to fill me in on this ? " I told him what had transpired to date , sidestepping the fact that the file had sat on Darcy 's desk for three days before it came to me . I was n't necessarily protecting her . In business , it 's smarter not to badmouththe help . I told him I had two rolls of film coming in , that there were n't any estimates yet , but the claim looked routine as far as I could see . I debated mention of my uneasiness , but discarded the idea even as I was speaking . I had n't identified what was bothering me and I felt it was wiser to stick to the facts . The frown on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what alarmed me was the silence that fell when I was done . Mac is a man who fires questions . Mac gives pop quizzes . He seldom sits and stares as he was doing in this case . " You want to tell me what this is about ? " I asked . " Did you see the note attached to the front of this file ? " " What note ? There was n't any note , " I said . He held out a California Fidelity memo form , maybe three inches by five , covered with Jewel 's curlicue script . " Kinsey . . . this one looks like a stinker . Sorry 1 do n't have time to fill you in , but the fire chief 's report spells it out . He said to call if he can give you any help . J. " " This was n't attached to the file when it came to me. "  | " What about the fire department report ? Was n't that in there ? " " Of course it was . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression was aggrieved . He handed me the file , open to the fire-department report . I looked down at the familiar STFD form . The incidental information was just as I remembered . The narrative accountI 'd never seen before . The fire chief , John Dudley , had summed up his investigation with a no-nonsense statement of suspected arson . The newspaper clipping now attached to the file ended with a line to the same effect . I could feel my face heat , the icy itch of fear beginning to assert itself . I said , " This is n't the report I saw . " My voice had dropped into a range I scarcely recognized . He held his hand out and I returned the file . " I got a phone call this morning , " he said . " Somebody says you 're on the take . " I stared . " What ? " " You got anything to say ? " " That 's absurd . Who called ? " " Let 's not worry about that for the moment . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal act and I want to know who it is . " He said nothing , but his face shut down in that stubborn way of his . " All right , skip that , " I said , yielding the point . I thought it wasbetter to get the story out before I worried about the characters . " What did this unidentified caller say ? " He leaned back in his chair , studying the cold coin of ash on the end of his cigar . " Somebody saw you accept an envelope from Lance Wood 's secretary , " he said . " Bullshit . When ? " " Last Friday . " I had a quick flash of Heather calling to me as I left the plant . " Those were inventory sheets . I asked Lance Wood to have them ready for me and he left ' em in his out box . " " What inventory sheets ? " " Right there in the file . " He shook his head , leafing through . From where I stood , I could see there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side . Therep23was nothing resembling the inventory sheets I 'd punched and inserted . He looked up at me . " What about the interview with Wood ? " " I have n't done that yet . An emergency came up and he disappeared . I 'm supposed to set up an appointment with him for today . " " What time ? " " Well , I do n't know . I have n't called him yet . I was trying to get the report typed up first . " I could n't seem to avoid the defensiveness in my tone . " This the envelope ? " Mac was holding the familiar envelope with the Wood/Warren logo , only now there was a message jotted on the front . " Hope this will suffice for now . Balance to follow as agreed . " " Goddamn it , Mac . You ca n't be serious ! If I were taking a payoff , why would I leave that in the file ? " No answer . I tried again . " You really think Lance Wood paid me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we better look into it . For your sake as well as ours ... " " If I took money , where 'd it go ? " " I do n't know , Kinsey . You tell me . If it was cash , it would n't be that hard to conceal . " " I 'd have to be a fool ! I 'd have to be an idiot and so would he . If he 's going to bribe me , do you think he 'd be stupid enough to put the cash in an envelope and write a note to that effect ! Mac , this whole thing has frame-up written all over it ! " " Why would anyone do that ? " At this point , his manner was n't accusatory . He seemed genuinely puzzled at the very idea . " Who would go to such lengths ? " " How do I know ? Maybe I just got caught in the loop . Maybe Lance Wood is the target . You know I 'd never do such a thing . I 'll bring you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check under my mattress , for God 's sake . . . . " I broke off in confusion . I saw his mouth move , but I did n't hear the rest of what he said . I could feel the trap close and something suddenly made sense . In the morning mail , I 'd gotten notice about five thousand dollars credited to my account . I think I knew now what that was about.  |p24I  packed up my personal belongings and my current files . California Fidelity had suspended our relationship until the Wood/Warren mattercould be " straightened out , " whatever that meant . I had until noon to clear the premises . I called the telephone company and asked to have calls forwarded to my home until further notice . I unplugged the answering machine and placed it on top of the last cardboard box , which I toted down the back steps to my car . I had been asked to turn in my office keys before I left , but I ignored the request . I had no intention of giving up access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Mac would press the point and I did n't think anyone would bother to have the locks changed . Screw ' em . I know how to pick most locks , anyway . In the meantime , I was already analyzing the sequence of events . The Wood/Warren folder had been sitting on my desk the entire weekendso the fire department reports could have been switched at any point . I 'd worked from notes that morning without reference to the file itself , so I had no way of knowing if the inventory sheets were in the file or not . I might not have registered the loss had I looked . My office door and the French doors opening out onto the balcony showed no signs of forced entry , but my handbag , along with my keys , had sat in Lance Wood 's office for three hours on Friday . Anybody could have gotten into that bag and had duplicate keys made . My checkbook was there , too , and it did n't take a wizard to figure out how somebody could have lifted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an envelope with five grand and put the whole of it in the night-deposit slot at my bank . Obviously my instant-teller card could n't be used because my code number was n't written down anyplace . I drove out to Wood/Warren , my brain clicking away , fired by adrenaline . The moment I 'd understood what was going on , the anger had passed and a chill of curiosity had settled in . I 'd felt my emotions disconnect and my mind had cleared like a radio suddenly tuned top25the right frequency . Someone had gone to a lot of trouble to discredit me . Insurance fraud is serious damn shit , punishable by two , three , or four years in the state prison . That was n't going to happen to me , folks . Heather stared at me , startled , as I moved through the Wood/Warrenreception area , scarcely slowing my pace . " Is he in ? " She looked down at the appointment book with confusion . " Do you have an appointment this morning ? " " Now I do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in . Lance was meeting with one of his engineers , John Salkowitz , the chemical engineer I had been introduced to on my earlier visit . The two men were bending over a set of specs for an item that looked like a giant diaper pin . " We need to talk , " I said . Lance took one look at my face and then flicked a signal to Salkowitz , indicating that they 'd continue some other time . I waited until the door closed and then leaned on Lance 's desk . " Somebody 's trying to shove one up our collective rear end , " I said . I detailed the situation to him , citing chapter and verse in a way that left no room for argument . He got the point . Some of the color left his face . He sank into his swivel chair . " Jesus , " he said . " I do n't believe it . " I could see him computing possibilities the same way I had . I drew up a chair and sat down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here so fast Friday afternoon ? " I asked . " It has to be connected , does n't it ? " " How so ? " " Because if I 'd questioned you as I intended to , you probably would have mentioned arson , and then I 'd have known the fire-department report was counterfeit . " " My housekeeper called . I 'm in the middle of a nasty divorce and Gretchen showed up at the house with two burly guys and a moving van . By the time I got home , she 'd cleared out the living room and was working on the den . " " Does she have the wherewithal to set up a deal like this ? " " Why would she do that ? It 's in her best interest to keep me alive and well and earning money hand over fist . Right now , she 's collecting over six grand a month in temporary support . Insurance fraud is thep26last thing she 'd want to stick me with . Besides , she 's been in Tulsa since March of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " The woman is a twit . If you knew her , you would n't suspect her of anything except licking a pencil point every time she has to write her name . " " Well , somebody sure wanted to blacken your name , " I said . " What makes you think it 's me they 're after ? Why could n't it be you ? " " Because no one could be sure I 'd be called in on this . These fire claims are assigned almost randomly , according to who 's free . If it 's me they want , they 'd have to go about it differently . They 're not going to burn down your warehouse on the off-chance that I 'll be called to investigate . " " I suppose not , " he said . " What about you ? What 's going on in your life , aside from the divorce ? " He picked up a pencil and began to loop it through his fingers , end over end , like a tiny baton . He watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a sister who moved back here from Paris three months ago . Rumor has it she wants control of the plant . " " Is this Ebony ? " He seemed surprised . " You know her ? " " Not well , but I know who she is . " " She disapproves of the way I run things . " " Enough to do this ? " He stared at me for a moment and then reached for the phone . " I better call my attorney . " " You and me both , " I said . I left and headed back into town . As far as I knew , the D.A . ' s office had n't been notified , and no charges had been filed . A valid arrest warrant has to be based on a complaint supported by facts showing , first of all , that a crime has been committed , and second , that the informer or his information is reliable . At this point , all Mac had was an anonymous telephone call and some circumstantial evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusation was correct , then CF had to be protected . My guess was that he 'd gop27back through my workload , case by case , to see if there was any whisper of misconduct on my part . He might also hire a private detectiveto look into the affairs of Wood/Warren , Lance Wood , and possiblyme  --  a novel idea . I wondered how my life would hold up if it were subjected to professional scrutiny . The five grand would certainly come to light . I was n't sure what to do about that . The deposit was damning in itself , but if I tried to move the money , it would look even worse . I remember the rest of the day in fragments . I talked to Lonnie Kingman , a criminal attorney I 'd done some work for in the past . He 's in his early forties , with a face like a boxer ; beetle-browed , broken nose . His hair is shaggy and his suits usually look too tight across the shoulder blades . He 's about five foot four and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same gym I do and I see him in there doing squats with three hundred pounds of plates wobbling on either end of the bar like water buckets . He graduated summa cum laude from Stanford Law School and he wears silk shirts with his monogram on the cuff . Attorneys are the people who can say things in the mildest of tones that make you want to shriek and rend your clothes . Like doctors , they seem to feel obliged to acquaint you with the full extent of the horror you could face , given the current path your life is on . When I told him what was happening , he tossed out two possible additions to the allegation of insurance fraud : that I 'd be named with Lance Wood as co-conspirator , and charged as an aider and abettor to arson after the fact . And that was just what he came up with off the top of his head . I could feel myself pale . " I do n't want to hear this shit , " I said . He shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were D.A. , " he said offhandedly . " I could probably add a few counts once I had all the facts . " " Facts , my ass . I never saw Lance Wood before in my life . " " Sure , but can you prove it ? " " Of course not ! How would I do that ? " Lonnie sighed like he was going to hate to see me in a shapeless prison dress . " Goddamn it , Lonnie , how come the law always helps the otherp28guy ? I swear to God , every time I turn around , the bad guys win and the little guys bite the Big Wienie . What am I supposed to do ? " He smiled . " It 's not as bad as all that , " he said . " My advice is to keep away from Lance Wood . " " How ? I ca n't just sit back and see what happens next . I want to know who set me up . " " I never said you could n't look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'd be careful if I were you . Insurance fraud is bad enough . You do n't want to take the rap for something worse . " I was afraid to ask him what he meant . I went home and unloaded the boxes full of office files . I took a few minutes to reword the message on my answering machine at home . I put a call through to Jonah Robb in Missing Persons at the Santa Teresa Police Department . As a lady in distress , I do n't ordinarily call on men . I 've been schooled in the notion that a woman , these days , saves herself , which I was willing to do if I could just figure out where to start . I 'd met Jonah six months before while I was working on a case . Our paths had crossed more than once , most recently in my bed . He 's thirty-nine , blunt , nurturing , funny , confused , a tormented man with blue eyes , black hair , and a wife named Camilla who stalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repress . I had ignored the chemistry between us for as long as I could , too wise ( said I ) to get pulled into a dalliance with a married gent . And then one rainy night I 'd run into him on my way home from a depressing interview with a hostile subject . Jonah and I started drinking margaritas in a bar near the beach . We danced to old Johnny Mathis tunes , talked , danced again , and ordered more drinks . Somewhere around " The Twelfth of Never , " I lost track of my resolve and took him home with me . Shit , I never could resist the lyrics on that one . We were currently at that stage in a new relationship where both parties are tentative , reluctant to presume , quick to feel injured , eager to know and be known as long as the true frailties of character are concealed . The risking felt good , and as a consequence the chemistry felt good , too . I smiled a lot when I thought of him and sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious pain . I 've been married twice , done in more times than I care to admit . I 'm not as trusting as I used to be and with good reason . Meanwhile , Jonahp29was in a constant state of upheaval according to the fluctuations in Camilla 's moods . Her most recent claim was that she wanted an " open " marriage , his guess being that the sexual liberties were intendedmore for her than for him . " Missing Persons . Sergeant Schiffman . " For an instant my mind went absolutely blank . " Rudy ? This is Kinsey . Where 's Jonah ? " " Oh , hi , Kinsey . He 's out of town . Took his family skiing for the holidays . It came up kind of sudden , but I thought he said he 'd let you know . He never called ? " " I guess not , " I said . " Do you know when he 's expected back ? " " Just a minute . Let me check . " He put me on hold and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Herald Angels Sing . " Christmas was over . Had n't anybody heard ? Rudy clicked back in . " Looks like January third . You want to leave a message ? " " Tell him I hung myself , " I said and rang off . I have to confess that in the privacy of my own home , I burst into tears and wept with frustration for six minutes flat . Then I went to work . The only line of attack I could think of was through Ash Wood . I had n't spoken to her since high school , nearly fourteen years . I tried the directory . Her mother , Helen Wood , was listed and so was Lance , but there was no sign of Ash , which probably meant that she 'd moved away or married . I tried the main house . A woman answered . I identifiedmyself and told her I was trying to locate Ash . Often I tell lies in a situation like this , but the truth seemed expedient . " Kinsey , is that really you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . All the Wood girls have voices that sound the same ; husky and low , underlaid with an accent nearly Southern in its tone . The inflection was distinct , not a drawl , but an indolence . Their mother was from Alabama , if my memory had n't failed me . " I ca n't believe my luck , " I said . " How are you ? " " Well , darlin ' , we are in a world of hurt , " she replied , " which is why I 'm so glad to hear from you . Lance mentioned that he 'd seen you at the plant last Friday . What 's happening ? " " That 's what I called to ask you . " " Oh lord . I 'd love to bring you up-to-date . Are you free for lunch by any chance ? "  | " For you . . . anything , " I said . She suggested the Edgewater Hotel at 12:30 , which suited me . I 'd have to change clothes first . My standard outfit consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tank top or a turtleneck , dependingon the season . Sometimes I wear a windbreaker or a denim vest , and I 've always got a large leather shoulder bag , which sometimes ( but not often ) contains my little .32 . I was relatively certain Ashley would n't appear in public like this . I hauled out my all-purpose dress , panty hose , and low heels . One day soon , I got ta get myself something else to wear.  |p31The  Edgewater Hotel sits on twenty-three acres of ocean-front property , with lawns sweeping down to the sea . An access road cuts through , not ten feet from the surf , with a sea wall constructed of local sandstone . The architecture of the main building is Spanish , with massivewhite stucco walls , arched doorways , and deeply recessed windows . Horizontal lines of red tile define the roof . A glass-walled dining patio juts out in front , white umbrella tables sheltering the patrons from sunlight and buffeting sea winds . The grounds are landscaped with juniper and palm , hibiscus , bottle brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annuals in hot pink , purple , and gold . The day was chill , the sky icy white and overcast . The drab olivegreensurf was churned up by the outer fringes of a storm system that had passed us to the north . The valet parking attendant was far too discreet to remark , even with a look , the battered state of my ancient car . I moved into the hotel lobby and down a wide corridor furnished with a series of overstuffedcouches , interspersed with rubber plants . The ceiling overhead was wood-beamed , the walls tiled halfway up , sounds muffled by a runner of thick carpet patterned with flowers the size of dinner plates . Ash had reserved a table in the main dining room . She was already seated , her face turned expectantly toward me as I approached . She looked much as she had in high school ; pale-red hair , blue eyes set in a wide , friendly face mottled with freckles . Her teeth were very white and straight and her smile was engaging . I had forgotten how casually she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a military cut , and over it a bulky white sheepskin vest . I thought , with regret , of myjeans and turtleneck . She was still maybe twenty pounds overweight , and she moved with all the enthusiasm of an ungainly pup , leaping up to hug me when I arrived at the table . There had always been a guileless quality about her . Despite the fact she came from money , she had never been snob/bish or affected . Where Olive had seemed reserved , and Ebony intimidating , Ash seemed utterly unself-conscious , one of those girls everybodyliked . In our sophomore year , we had ended up sitting in adjoining home-room seats and we 'd often chatted companionably beforeclasses began . Neither of us was a cheerleader , an honor student , or a candidate for prom queen . The friendship that sprang up between us , though genuine , was short-lived . I met her family . She met my aunt . I went to her house and thereafter neatly bypassed her coming to mine . While the Woods were always gracious to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social heap and I at the bottom . Eventually the disparity made me so uncomfortable that I let the contact lapse . If Ash was injured by the rejection , she did a good job of covering it . I felt guilty about her anyway and was relieved the next year when she sat somewhere else . " Kinsey , you look great . I 'm so glad you called . I ordered us a bottle of Chardonnay . I hope that 's okay . " " Fine , " I said , smiling . " You look just the same . " " Big rump , you mean , " she said with a laugh . " You 're just as thin as you always were , only I half expected you to show up in jeans . I do n't believe I ever saw you in a dress . " " I thought I 'd act like I had some class , " I said . " How are you ? When I did n't find you listed in the phone book , I thought you 'd probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been gone for ten years and just got back . What about you ? I ca n't believe you 're a private detective . I always figured you 'd end up in jail . You were such a rebel back then . " I laughed . I was a misfit in high school and hung out with guys known as " low-wallers , " because they loitered along a low wall at the far end of the school grounds . " You remember Donan , the boy with the gold tooth who sat right in front of you in homeroom ? He 's an ObGynin town . Got his teeth fixed and went to med school . " Ash groaned , laughing . " God , that 's one way to get your hand up a girl 's skirt . What about the little swarthy one who sat next to you ? He was funny . I liked him . " " He 's still around . Bald now and overweight . He runs a liquor store up on the Bluffs . Who was that girlfriend of yours who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's living with a fellow in Santa Fe who designs furni/ture . I saw her about a year ago when I was passing through . God , she 's still a klepto . Are you married ? " " Was . " I held up two fingers to indicate the number of husbands who had come and gone . " Children ? " she asked . " Oh God , no . Not me . You have any ? " " Sometimes I wish I did . " Ash was watching me with shining eyes and somehow I knew anything I said would be fine with her . " When did we see each other last ? It 's been years , has n't it ? " I asked . She nodded . " Bass 's twenty-first birthday party at the country club . You were with the most beautiful boy I ever saw in my life . " " Daniel , " I said . " He was husband number two . " " What about number one ? What was he like ? " " I better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , presenting the label for her inspection before he opened it . She waved aside the ritual of the sniffingof the cork and let him go ahead and pour for both of us . I noticed that the waiter was smiling to himself , probably charmed as most people are by Ash 's breezy manner and her impatience with formality . He was tall and slim , maybe twenty-six years old , and he told us about the specials as if we might want to take notes . " The sea bass is being served today with a green chili beurre blanc , gently poached first with fresh tomatoes , cilantro , lemon , and white wine , garnished with jalapeflos and accompanied by a pine-nut rice pilau . We 're also offeringa fillet of coho salmon . . . " Ash made little mewing sounds , interrupting now and then for clarification of some culinary subtlety . I let her order for us . She knew all the waiters by name and ended up in a long chat with ours about what we should eat . She settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of field greens lightly dressed , and said we 'd think about dessert if we were good girls and cleaned our plates . While we ate , I told her about my connection to Wood/Warren and the irregularities that had come to light . " Oh , Kinsey . I feel awful . I hope Lance is n't responsible for the trouble you 're in . " " Believe me , I do , too . What 's the story on him ? Is he the type to burn down the family warehouse ? "  |p34Ash  did n't leap to his defense as I 'd expected her to . " If he did , I do n't think he 'd snitch on himself , " she said . " Good point . Who 'd go after him like that ? " " I do n't know . That whole situation got very screwed up once Daddy died . He was crazy about the boys , but Bass was a dilettante and Lance raised hell half the time . " " I seem to remember that . Your father must have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know how straight he was . Daddy had real strong ideas about parenting , but most of them were wrong . He had no idea how to implement them anyway . He wanted to control and mold and dominate but he could n't even do that very well . Kids just do n't behavelike company employees . Daddy thought he 'd have more control at home , but the truth was , he had less . Both Lance and Bass were determined to thwart him . Bass never has straightened out . " " He 's still in New York ? " " Oh , he comes home now and then  --  he was here for a week at Thanksgiving  --  but for the most part , he 's gone . New York , Boston , London . He spent a year in Italy and swears he 's going back . Much as I love him , he 's a waste of time . I do n't think he 's ever going to get his act together . Of course , Lance was that way for years . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance had a few scrapes with the law . It drove Daddy up the wall . " The clams arrived . Each of us was presented with a plate piled high with small , perfect shells , swaddled in cloth to keep the broth piping hot . She speared a tender button of clam flesh and placed it on her tongue , her eyes closing in a near-swoon as she swallowed . I watched her butter a crescent of French bread and dip it in the bowl , sopping up clam liquor . As she bit into it , she made a little sound low in her throat like something out of an X-rated video . " Your lunch okay ? " I asked drily . " Fine , " she said . " Good . " She realized belatedly that I was teasing her and she smiled , her cheeks tinted becomingly with pink . " Someoneasked me once which I 'd rather have  --  sex or a warm chocolatechipcookie . I still ca n't decide . " " Go for the cookies . You can bake ' em yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine . " Anyway , about the last six or seven years , Lance took hold , more or less , and startedp35showing an interest in the business . Daddy was thrilled . Wood/Warren was Daddy 's life . He loved us , but he could n't manage us the way he did the business . By the time Bass came along , the last in line , Daddy'dpretty much given up any hopes for a successor . " " What about Ebony ? " " Oh , she 's been passionate about the company since she was a kid , but she did n't believe Daddy 'd ever let her have a hand in it . He was old-fashioned . A man leaves his business to his oldest son . Period . He knew Ebony was smart , but he did n't think she was tough enough , and he did n't think she 'd stay with it . Women get married and have babies and spend money . That was his attitude . Women join the countryclub and play tennis and golf . They do n't go head-to-head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to Cal Poly and started working on an engineering degree , but Daddy made it clear it would n't help her cause , so she went to Europe and got married instead . " " Thus fulfilling his prophesy , " I said . " That 's right . Of course , at that point , Daddy did a turnaround and swore he 'd have left her the company if she 'd stuck it out . She hated him for that , and I did n't blame her a bit . He was a real shit some-times . " " She 's back now , is n't she ? " " Right . She got home in August , minus Julian , which is no big loss . He was a dud if I ever saw one . A real bore . I do n't know how she put up with him . " " Lance says she wants to take over . " " I 've heard that , too , though it 's not anything she talks to me about . I get along with Ebony , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olive ? Is she interested ? " " Peripherally , I guess . She married one of the chemical engineers who worked for Daddy . He 's vice-president now , but they met when she was still in college and he 'd just hired on . " " Is that Terry Kohler ? " She nodded . " You met him ? " " When I was out there . What 's he like ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Smart . Moody . Intense . Pleasant enough , but sort of humorless . Good at what he does . Crazy about her , I must say . He worships the ground she walks on . Slavish ' is the word . "  | " Lucky girl . Is he ambitious ? " " He used to be . He wanted to go out on his own at one point and form his own company , but I guess it did n't work out . He kind of lost heart after that , and I do n't know . . . being married to the boss 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he get along with Lance ? " " They clash now and then . Terry 's easily offended . You know the type . He gets his nose bent out of shape at the least little thing . " " What about John Salkowitz ? " " He 's a sweetie . He 's what Daddy wanted Lance to be . " " You said Lance had a couple of scrapes with the law . What was that about ? " " He stole some things from the plant . " " Really . When was this ? " " In high school . He came up with a scheme to make some money , but it did n't work out . It was part of an economics class and I guess his grade depended on how well he did . When he realized his little enterprise was failing , he stole some equipment  --  nothing big  --  but he tried to sell it to a fence . The guy got uneasy and called the cops . " " Not too smart . " " That 's what pissed Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges ? " " Are you kidding ? Of course . He said that was the only way Lance would ever learn . " " And did he ? " " Well , he got in trouble again , if that 's what you mean . Lots of times . Daddy finally threw his hands up and sent him off to boarding school . " The subject veered off . We finished lunch , chatting about other things . At two , Ash glanced at her watch . " Oh lord . I 've got to go . I promised Mother I 'd take her shopping this afternoon . Come along if you like . I know she 'd love to see you . " She signaled for the check . " I better take care of some other business first , but I do want to talk to her . " " Give us a call and come up to the house . " " Are you living there now ? " " Temporarily . I just bought a place of my own and I 'm having some work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . "  |p37When  the check arrived , I reached for my handbag , but she waved me off . " I 'll take care of it . I 'll claim it as a business lunch and charge it off to the company . It 's the least I can do with the bind you 're in . " " Thanks , " I said . I got Ebony 's personal telephone number from her and we walked out together . I was relieved that the valet service brought her car first . I watched her pull away in a little red AlfaRomeo . My car appeared . I tipped the fellow more than I should have and got in with care , humping myself onto the seat to avoid snagging my panty hose behind the knee . The valet slammed the door and I turned the key . Honest to God , it started right up and I felt a surge of pride . The damn thing is paid for and only costs me ten bucks a week in gas . I drove home and let myself in the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The winter grass seemed ragged and the dead heads on the zinnias and marigolds had multiplied . Henry 's house stood silent , his back door looking blank . Usually the scent of yeast or cinnamon lies on the air like a heady perfume . Henry 's a retired commercial baker who ca n't quite give up his passionfor kneading dough and proofing bread . If he is n't in the kitchen , I can usually find him on the patio , weeding the flower beds or stretched out on a chaise inventing crossword puzzles filled with convolutedpuns . I let myself into my apartment and changed back into jeans , my whole body sighing with relief . I hauled the mower out of the toolshed and had a run at the yard , and then I got down on my hands and knees and clipped all the dead blossoms from the beds . This was very boring . I put the lawn mower away . I went inside and typed up my notes . As long as I was investigating in my own behalf , I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Rosie 's was closed , I ate dinner at home , preparing a cheeseand-picklesandwich , which entertained me no end . I 'd finished the Len Deighton and I did n't have anything else in the house to read , so I switched on my little portable television set . Sometimes I wonder if my personal resources are n't wearing a little thin.  |p38Tuesday  morning , I went into the gym at 6:00 A.M. As I no longer had an office to go to , I could well have waited until later in the morning , but I like the place at that hour . It 's quiet and half empty so there 's no competition for equipment . The free weights are neatly reracked . The mirrors are clean and the air does n't smell like yesterday 's sweat socks . Weight-lifting apparatus are a curious phenomenon  --  machines invented to replicate the backbreaking manual labor the Industrial Revolution relieved us of . Lifting weights is like a meditation : intermittentperiods of concentrated activity , with intervals of rest . It 's a good time for thinking , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ; thirty-five , then thirty , then twenty-five . I adjusted the bench on one of the Nautilus machines and started doing seated military presses , three sets , ten reps each , using two plates . The guys lift anywhere from ten to twenty plates , but I work just as hard , and I 'm not really preparing for the regional body-building championship . I was thinking back over the details of the frame-up . . . a clever piece of work , dependent on a number of events coming together just as they had . The phone call to Mac must have come from Ava Daugherty , but who put her up to it ? Surely , she did n't cook up that trouble by herself . Someone had access to the Wood/Warren file , and while it was possible that the office keys had been lifted from my bag , who at Wood/Warren knew enough to make a mockup of a fire-department report ? That must have been done by someone who knew the procedureat CF. Insurance investigations usually follow a format . An outsidersimply could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the necessary sequence . Darcy could have managed it . Andy might have , or even Mac . But why ? I worked through biceps and triceps . Since I jog six days a week , my prime interest in the gym is the three A 's  --  arms , abs and ass  --  a routine that takes forty-five minutes three times a week . I was finished by seven-fifteen . I went home to shower and then I started out again ,  |p39dressed  in jeans , turtleneck , and boots . Darcy was due at work at nine , but I 'd spotted her three days out of five having breakfast first , coffee and a Danish in the coffee shop across the street . She used the time to chitchat , read the newspaper , and do her nails . There was no sign of her when I got there at eight . I bought a paper and settled into the back booth where she usually sits . Claudine came by and I ordered breakfast . At eight-twelve , Darcy came through the door in a lightweight wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stride , and slid into an empty booth halfway down . I picked up my coffee cup and joined her , loving the sour look that crossed her face when she realized what I was up to . " Mind if I join you ? " I asked . " Well , actually , I 'd prefer to have the time to myself , " she said , avoiding my gaze . Claudine arrived with a steaming plate of bacon and scrambled eggs which she set down in front of me . Claudine is in her fifties , with a booming voice and calves knotted with varicose veins . " Morning , Darcy . What 'll you have today ? We 're out of cheese Danish , but I laid back a cherry in case you 're interested . " " That 's fine . And a small orange juice . " Claudine made a note and tucked her order pad in her apron pocket . " Just a second and I 'll bring you a coffee cup . " She was gone again before Darcy could protest . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an empty seat . The place was filling up rapidly and it looked like she was trapped . While I ate , I studied her in a manner that I hoped was disconcerting . She eased out of her coat , making a big deal out of standing up so she could fold it just so . She 's one of those women a glamour magazineshould " make-over " as a challenge to their in-house experts . She has baby-fine hair that defies styling , a high , bulging forehead , paleblueeyes . Her skin is milky white and translucent , with a tracery of veins showing through like faded laundry marks . I 'd heard Darcy 's boyfriend was a mail carrier , dealing drugs on the side , and I wondered if he delivered junk mail and junk on the same run . I could tell I was ruining her day , which improved my appetite . " I 'm assuming you heard about the trouble I 'm in . " " It 'd be hard not to , " she said.  |p40I  opened a plastic locket of grape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Got any ideas about who set me up ? " Claudine returned with a cup and saucer and the coffeepot . Darcy judiciously elected to refrain from comment until her cup was filled and mine had been topped off . When Claudine departed , Darcy 's expressionturned prim and her coloring altered like a mood ring , shiftingdown a grade from woeful to glum . Actually , the change was not unappealing . She 's big on pastel shades , imagining , I suppose , that washed-out colors are somehow more flattering to her than bold ones . She wore a pale-yellow sweater about the hue of certain urine samples I 've seen where the prognosis is n't keen . The pink in her cheeks gave her back an air of health . She leaned forward . " I did n't do anything to you , " she said . " Great . Then maybe you can help . " " Mac told us specifically not to talk to you . " " How come ? " " Well , obviously , he does n't want you to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such as ? " " I 'm not going to discuss it with you . " " Why do n't I tell you my theory , " I said sociably . I half expected her to stick her fingers in her ears and start singing aloud to drown me out , but I noticed that she was not completely uninterested and I took heart from that . " I suspect maybe Andy 's at the bottom of this . I do n't know what he 's getting out of it , but it 's probably some form of financialgain . Maybe somebody 's throwing business his way , or giving him a kickback . Of course , it crossed my mind that it might be you , but I do n't really think so at this point . I think if you 'd done it you 'd be friendly , to convince me of your goodwill , if nothing else . " Darcy opened a paper sugar packet and measured out half a teaspoon , which she stirred into her coffee . I went right on , talking aloud as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " CF hires other outside investigators so I 'm imagining that any one of us could have been implicated . It was just my dumb luck that I was up at bat . Not that Andy would n't take a certain satisfaction from the fact . He 's never been fond of me and he always hated it that Mac let me have office space . Andy wanted to knock the wall out and take that corner for himself . At any rate , I have to assume Lance Wood is thep41real focus of the frame , though I do n't know why yet . What I 'll probablydo is try working both sides of the street here and just see where all the paths intersect . Should be fun . I 've never worked for me before and I 'm looking forward to it . Cuts down on the paperwork . " I checked her reaction . Those pale eyes were focused on mine and I could see that her mental gears were engaged . " Come on , Darcy . Help me out , " I coaxed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't even like me . " " You do n't like me either . What 's that got to do with it ? We both hate Andy . That 's the point . The guy 's a shit-heel . " " Actually he is , " she said . " You do n't think Mac had anything to do with it , do you ? " " Well , no . " " So who else could it be ? " She cleared her throat . " Andy has been hanging around my desk a lot . " Her voice was so low , I had to lean forward . " Go on . " " It started the day Jewel left on vacation and Mac told him to farm out her work . Andy was the one who suggested you for the Wood/ Warren fire claim . " " He probably thought it 'd be easier to pressure me . " Claudine brought Darcy 's OJ and the cherry Danish . Darcy broke the Danish into small pieces , buttering each with care before she popped it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was just warming up on the subject of Andy Motycka , who was apparently no fonder of her than he was of me . " What irritates me , " she said , " is that I got in trouble with Mac because Andy said the file sat on my desk for three days before it got to you . That 's an outright lie . Andy took it home with him . I saw him put it in his briefcase Tuesday when the fire-department report came in . " " Did you tell Mac that ? " " Well , no . Why bother ? It sounds like I 'm trying to defend myself by pushing all the blame off on him . " " You 're right . I found myself in the same position , " I said . " Look , if Andy falsified the fire-department report , he probably did the dirty work at home , do n't you think ? " " Probably . "  | " So maybe we can turn up some proof if we look . I 'll nose around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He moved , you know . He 's not at the house . He and Janice are in the process of splitting up . " " He 's getting divorced ? " " Oh , sure . It 's been going on for months . She 's hosing him , too . " " Really . Well , that 's interesting . Where 's he living ? " " One of those condos out near Sand Castle . " I 'd seen the complex : one hundred and sixty units across from a public golf course called Sand Castle , out beyond Colgate in the little community of Elton . " What about his office ? Is there any way you could check that out ? " Darcy smiled for the first time . " Sure . I 'll do that . It would serve him right . " I got her home number and said I 'd call later . I paid both checks and took off , figuring it would n't be a good idea to get caught in Darcy 's company . While I was downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a discreet chat with a friend of mine who works as a key-punch operator . I 'd done some work for her years before , checking into the background of a certain seedy gent who had hoped to relieve her of a burdensome savings account . She 'd had the bucks in hand to pay me , but I sensed that both of us would benefit from a little bartering  --  " professional courtesies , " as they 're known . Now I check out any new fellow in her life , and in return , she pirates occasional confirmation copies of computer runs . One drawback is that I have to wait until a periodic updating of the master file is scheduled , which usually happens once a week . I asked her to give me anything she had on Lance Wood and she promised me something in a day . On an impulse , I asked her to check out Andy Motycka while . she was at it . Financial information on Wood/Warren I 'd have to get from the local equivalent of Dun &; Bradstreet . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , for whom Lance Wood had no doubt filled out countless forms in applying for coverage . I was hoping I could enlist Darcy 's aid again on that one . It was amazing to me how much more appealing she seemed now that she was on my team . I trotted back to pick up my car . As I pulled out of the parking lot behind the building , Andy wasp43just pulling in , pausing while the machine stamped and spat a ticket through the slot . He pretended he did n't see me . I drove back to my apartment . I 'd never paid much attention to the looming importance of the office in my life . I conduct maybe 40 percent of all business in my swivel chair , telephone in the crook of my neck , files close at hand . Sixty percent of the time I 'm probably on the road , but I do n't like feeling cut off from my reference points . It puts me at a subtle disadvantage . It was only five after ten and the day loomed ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable Smith-Corona and started typing up my notes . That done , I caught up with some filing , prepared some bills for a couple of outstanding accounts , and then tidied up my desk . I hate sitting around . Especially when I could be out getting into trouble . I gave Darcy a call at CF and got Andy 's new address and telephone number . She assured me he was sitting in his office even as we spoke . I dialed his apartment and was reassured to hear the phone ring and ring and ring . I changed into a pair of blue-gray slacks with a pale stripe along the seam and a matching pale-blue shirt with Southern California Services stitched around a patch on the sleeve . I added hard black shoes left over from my days on traffic detail with the Santa Teresa Police Department , tacked on a self-important key ring with a long chain , and grabbed up a clipboard , my key picks , and a set of master keys . I checked myself out in the mirror . I looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  of what , I was n't sure . I looked like I could read meters and make importantnotes . I looked like I could verify downed lines and order up repair crews on the mobile phone in my county-owned maintenance vehicle . I hopped in my car and headed out to Andy 's condominium for a little B &; E.p44The Copse at Hurstbourne is one of those fancy-sounding titles for a brand-new tract of condominiums on the outskirts of town . " Copse " as in " a thicket of small trees . " " Hurst " as in " hillock , knoll , or mound . " And " bourne " as in " brook or stream . " All of these geologicaland botanical wonders did seem to conjoin within the twenty parcelsof the development , but it was hard to understand why it could n't have just been called Shady Acres , which is what it was . Apparently people are n't willing to pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a home that does n't sound like it 's part of an Anglo-Saxon land grant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mexicans . Try marketing Rancho Feinstein if you want to lose money in a hurry . Or Paco Sanchez Park . Middle-class Americans aspire to tone , which is equated , absurdly , with the British gentry . I had alreadypassed Essex Hill , Stratford Heights , and Hampton Ridge . The Copse at Hurstbourne was surrounded by a high wall of fieldstone , with an electronic gate meant to keep the riffraff out . The residentswere listed on a mounted panel beside a telephone handset with push-buttons , and an intercom . Each occupant was assigned a personalentry code that one had to have in order to gain admittance . I know because I tried several sequences at random and got nowhere . I pulled over and waited until another car approached . The driver punched in his code . When the gate rolled back , I tucked my car in behind his and sailed through . No alarms went off . I was n't set upon by dogs . Security measures , like the property 's pedigree , were largely in the mind of the marketing team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , gray frame with white trim in a Cape Cod style , all angles , mullioned windows , and wooden balconies . Sycamore and eucalyptus trees still graced the terrain . Winding roads led in two directions , but it was clear that both came together in the same rear parking lot rimmedp45with carports . I found a visitor 's space and pulled in , checking the building directory which sported a plot map of units . Andy Motycka 's was number 144 , located , happily , at the far reaches of the property . I took my clipboard and a flashlight and tried to look as officious as I could . I passed the recreational facility , the spa , the laundry rooms , the gym , and the sales office . There were no signs of children . Judging from the number of empty carports , my guess was that many of the residents were off at work somewhere else . Wonderful . A band of thugs could probably sweep through and clean the place out in half a day . I moved around some Cape Cod-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the second floor of building number 18 . The landing of the apartment next door to Andy 's was attractively furnished with shoulder-high ficus and assorted potted plants . Andy 's porchlet was bare . Not even a doormat . The drapes were open , and there were no interior lights on . No sound of a television set , stereo , or toilets flushing . I rang the bell . I waited a decent interval , easing back slightly so I could check for tenants on either side . No signs of activity . It looked like I had the building to myself . The front-door lock was a Weiss . I sorted through my key picks and tried one or two without luck . Picking a lock is time-consuming shit and I did n't feel I could stand out there indefinitely . Someone might pass and wonder why I was jiggling that length of thin metal in the keyhole and cursing mildly to myself . On an impulse I raised my hand and felt along the top of the doorjamb . Andy 'd left me his key . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not supposed to be . I can empathizewith cat burglars , housebreakers , and second-story men , experiencing , as I 've heard some do , adrenaline raised to a nearly sexual pitch . My heart was thudding and I felt extraordinarily alert . I did a quick walking survey , eyeballing the two bedrooms , walk-in closets and both bathrooms , just to determine that no one was tossing the apartment but me . In the master bedroom , I opened the sliding glass door and the screen . I went out on the balcony that connected the two bedrooms and devised an escape route in case Andy came home unexpectedly . Against the side wall , around the corner to the right , was an ornamental trellis with a newly planted bougainvillea atp46its base . In a pinch , I could scamper down like an orangutan and disappear . I eased back into the apartment and began my search . Andy 's bedroomfloor was densely matted with dirty clothes , through which a narrow path had been cleared . I picked my way past socks , dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints . In lieu of a chest of drawers , he kept his clean clothes in four dark-blue plastic stacking crates . His new-found bachelorhood must be taking him back to his college days . None of the bins contained anything of interest . I spent fifteen minutes sliding my hand into all the coat pockets on his hangingrod , but all I came up with were some woofies , a handkerchief full of old boogers , and a ticket for a batch of cleaning he had n't yet retrieved . The second bedroom was smaller . Andy 's bicycle was propped against one wall , the back tire flat . He had a rowing machine , eight cardboard moving boxes , unlabeled and still taped shut . I wondered how long he 'd been separated . I 'd met Andy 's wife , Janice , at a couple of California Fidelity office parties and had n't thought much of her until I saw what she 'd left him with . The lady had really done a thorough shakedown . Andy had always complained about her extravagance , making sure we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a measure of his success , of course , that she could charge with impunity . What was clear now was that she played for keeps . Andy 'd been granted a card table , four aluminum lawn chairs with webbed seats , a mattress , and some flatwear with what must have been his mother 's monogram . It looked like Janice had been sticking it in the dishwasher for years because the finish was dull and the silver plate was worn off the handles . The kitchen cabinets held paper plates and insulated cups , along with a sorry assortment of canned goods . This guy ate worse than I did . Since the condos were brand-new , the appliances were up-to-date and immaculate : self-cleaning oven , big refrigerator ( empty except for two six-packs of no-brand beer ) , with an ice-maker clattering away , dishwasher , microwave , disposal , trash compactor . The freezer was stacked with cartons of Lean Cuisine . He favored Spaghetti and Chicken Cacciatore . A bottle of aquavit lay on its side and he had a bag of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break off a tooth . The dining area was actually a simple extension of the small livingp47room , the kitchen separated by a pass-through with bi-fold shutters painted white . There was very little in the way of furnishings . The card table seemed to double as dining-room table and home office . The telephone sat there , plugged into the answering machine , which showed no messages . The surface was littered with typing supplies , but there was no typewriter in sight . His bottle of white-out was gettingas sluggish as old nail polish . The wastebasket was empty . I went back into the kitchen and slid open the compactor , which was loosely packed , but full . Gingerly , I rooted through , spotting crumpled sheets of paper about three layers down . I removed the liner and inserted a fresh one . I doubted Andy would remember whether he 'd emptied his trash or not . He 'd probably spent most of his married life being waited on hand and foot , and my guess was he took householdchores for granted , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pee off the rim of the toilet bowl whenever he missed . I glanced at my watch . I 'd been in the place thirty-five minutes and I did n't want to press my luck . I closed and locked the sliding glass door again , made a final pass to see if I 'd overlooked anything , and then let myself out the front , taking his trash bag with me . By noon , I was home again , sitting on Henry 's back patio with Andy 's garbage spread around me like a beggar 's picnic . Actually , the debris was fairly benign and did n't make me feel I needed a tetanus booster just to sort through . He was heavy into pickles , olives , anchovies , jalapeno peppers , and other foodstuffs in which no germs could live . There were no coffee grounds or orange peels . No evidence whateverthat he ate anything fresh . Lots of beer cans . There were six plastic Lean Cuisine pouches , layers of junk mail , six dunning notices rimmed in red or pink , a notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flyer from a carwash , and a letter from Janice that must have left him incensed , as he had crumpled it into a tiny ball and bitten down on it . I could see the perfect impression of his teeth in the wadded paper . She was bugging him about a temporary support check that was late again , said she , underlined twice and bracketed with exclamation points . At the bottom of the bag was the back end of a pad of checks , deposit slips still attached , with the name of Andy 's bank and his checking-account number neatly printed thereon . I saved that for fu/ture reference . I had set aside the crumpled papers that were shoved into the bag halfway down . I smoothed them out now  --  six versions of a letter to someone he referred to variously as " angel , " " beloved , " " light of my life , " " my darling , " and " dearest one . " He seemed to remember her anatomy in loving detail without much attention to her intellect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , apparently , impaired his typing skills  --  lots of strikeovers in the lines where he reviewed their " time together , " which I gathered was on or about Christmas Eve . In recalling the experience , he seemed to strugglewith a paucity of adjectives , but the verbs were clear enough . " Well , Andy , you old devil , " I murmured to myself . He said he longed to have her suckle the something-something from his xxxxxxxx . . . all crossed out . My guess was that it was related to flower parts and that his botanical knowledge had failed him . Either that or the very idea had caused emotional dyslexia . Also , he could n't quite decide what tone to take . He vacillated somewhere between groveling and reverential . He said several things about her breasts that made me wonder if she might benefit from surgical reduction . It was embarrassing reading , but I tried not to shrink from my responsibilities . Having finished , I made a neat packet of all the papers . I 'd make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any might be of use . I shoved the trash back in the bag and tossed it in Henry 's garbagecan . I let myself into my apartment and checked my answering machine . There was one message . " Hi , Kinsey . This is Ash . Listen , I talked to my mother yesterday about this business with Lance and she 'd like to meet with you , if that 's okay . Give me a call when you get in and we 'll set something up . Maybe this afternoon sometime if that works for you . Thanks . Talk to you soon . Bye . " I tried the number at the house , but the line was busy . I changed into my jeans and made myself some lunch . By the time I got through to Ash , her mother was resting and could n't be disturbed , but I was invited to tea at four . I decided to drive up the pass to the gun club and practice target shooting with the little .32 I keep locked in my top desk drawer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a box of fifty cartridges into a small canvas duffel and tucked it in the trunk of my car . I stopped forp49gas and then headed north on 101 to the junction of 154 , following the steep road that zigzags up the mountainside . The day was chilly . We 'd had several days of unexpected rain and the vegetation was a dark green , blending in the distance to an intense navy blue . The clouds overhead were a cottony white with ragged underpinnings , like the torn lining on the underside of an old box spring . As the road ascended , fog began to mass and dissipate , traffic slowing to accommodate the fluctuating visibility . I downshifted twice and pulled the heater on . At the summit , I turned left onto a secondary road barely two lanes wide , which angled upward , twisting half a mile into back country . Massive boulders lined the road , mantled in dark-green moss where the overhanging trees blocked out the sun . The trunks of the live oaks were frosted with fungus the color of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laurel and the frail scent of woodsmoke drifting from the cabins tucked in along the ridge . Where the roadside dropped away , the canyons were blank with fog . The wide gate to the gun club was open and I drove the last several hundred yards , pulling into the gravel parking lot , deserted except for a lone station wagon . Aside from the man in charge , I was the only person there . I paid to the storage room and extracted an oblong of cardboard mounted on a piece of lathing , with a target stapled to it . " Visibil'ty might be tough now in this fog , " he warned . " I 'll chance it , " I said . He eyed me with misgivings , but finally handed over the target , a staple gun , and two additional targets . I had n't been up to the practice range for months , and it was nice to have the whole place to myself . The wind had picked up and mist was being blown across concrete bunkers like something in a horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty-five yards . I inserted soft plastic earplugs and then put on hearing protectors over that . All outside noises were damped down to a mild hush , my breathing audible in my own head as though I were swimming . I loaded eight cartridges into the clip of my .32 and began to fire . Each round sounded like a balloon popping somewhere close by , followed by the characteristic whiff of gunpowder I so love.  |p50I  moved up to the target and checked to see where I was hitting . High and left . I circled the first eight holes with a Magic Marker , went back to the bench rest and loaded the gun again . A sign just behind me read : " Guns as we use them here are a source of pleasure and entertainment , but one moment of carelessness or foolishness can bring it all to an end forever . " Amen , I thought . The hard-packed dirt just in front of me was as littered with shells as a battlefield . I saved my brass , collecting the casings after each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cradled the live rounds . By 3:15 I was cold , and most of my ammunition was gone . I ca n't claim that my little semi-automatic is wildly accurate at twenty-five yards , but at least I was feeling connected to the process again.  |p51At  3:55 , I was turning into the circular drive to the Wood family home , located on seven acres of land that sat on the bluffs overlooking the Pacific . They 'd moved since I 'd last visited , fortunes on the rise . This house was enormous , done in a French Baroque style  --  a twostorycentral structure flanked by two prominent tower wings . The stucco exterior was as smooth and white as frosting on a wedding cake , roofline and windows edged with plaster garlands , rosettes , and shell motifs that might have been piped out of a pastry tube . A brick walk led from the driveway around to the seaward-facing front of the house and up two steps to a wide uncovered brick porch . A series of arched French doors spanned the facade , curving outward around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . A heavy black woman in a white uniform admitted me . I followed her , like a stray pup , across a foyer tiled in black and white marble squares . " Mrs. Wood asked if you 'd wait in the morning room , " the maid said , without pausing for a reply . She departed on thick crepe soles that made no sound on the polished parquet floors . Oh , sure , I thought , that 's where I usually hang out at my place ... the morning room , where else ? The walls were apricot , the ceiling a high dome of white . Large Boston ferns were arranged on stands between high curving windows that streamed with light . The furniture was French Provincial ; round table , six chairs with cane backs . The circle of Persian carpeting was a pale blend of peach and green . I stood at one of the windows , looking out at the rolling sweep of the grounds ( which is what rich people call their yards ) . The C-shape of the room cupped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the mountains in its hook so that the windows formed a cyclorama . Sky and sea , pines , a pie wedge of city , clouds spilling down the distant mountainside . . . all of it was perfectlyframed , wheeling gulls picked out in white against the dark hills to the north.  |p52What  I love about the rich is the silence they live in  --  the sheer magnitude of space . Money buys light and high ceilings , six windows where one might actually do . There was no dust , no streaks in the glass , no scuff marks on the slender bowed legs of the matching French Provincial chairs . I heard a whisper of sound , and the maid returned with a rolling serving cart , loaded with a silver tea service , a plate of assorted tea sandwiches , and pastries the cook had probably whipped up that day . " Mrs. Wood will be right with you , " she said to me . " Thanks , " I said . " Uh , is there a lavatory close by ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ma'am . Turn left into the foyer . Then it 's the first door on the left . " I tiptoed to the loo and locked myself in , staring at my reflection in the mirror with despair . Of course , I was dressed wrong . I never could guess right when it came to clothes . I 'd gone to the Edgewater Hotel in my all-purpose dress , eating lunch with Ashley , who 'd worn an outfit suitable for bagging game . Now I had down-dressed to the point where I looked like a bum . I do n't know what I 'd been thinking of . I knew the Woods had money . I 'd just forgotten how much . The trouble with me is I have no class . I was raised in a two-bedroom stucco bungalow , maybe eight hundred and fifty square feet of space , if you counted the little screened-in utility porch . The yard was a tatty fringe of crab grass surrounded by the kind of white picket fence you bought in sections and stuck in the ground where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was a pink plastic flamingo standing on one foot , which I 'd thought was pretty classy shit until I was twelve . I blocked the bathroom out of my visual field , but not before I got a glimpse of marble , pale-blue porcelain , and gold-plated hardware . A shallow dish held six robin's-egg-sized ovals of soap that had never been touched before by human hands . I peed and then just ran my hands under the water and shook them off , not wanting to soil anything . The terry hand towels looked as though they 'd just had the price tags removed from the rims . There were four guest towels laid out beside the basin like big decorative paper napkins , but I was way too smart to fall for that trick . Where would I put a used one afterward  --  inthe trash ? These people did n't make trash . I finished dryingp53my hands on the backside of my jeans and returned to the morning room feeling damp around the rear . I did n't dare sit down . Presently , Ash appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked slowly , with a halting gait , as if she 'd been forced to ambulate with a pair of swim fins for shoes . I was startled to realize she must be in her early seventies , which meant that she 'd had her children rather late . Seventy is n't that old out here . People in Californiaseem to age at a different rate than the rest of the country . Maybe it 's the passion for diet and exercise , maybe the popularity of cosmetic surgery . Or maybe we 're afflicted with such a horror of aging that we 've halted the process psychically . Mrs. Wood apparently had n't developed the knack . The years had knocked her flat , leaving her knees weak and her hands atremble , a phenomenon that seemed to cause her bitter amusement . She appeared to watch her own progress as if she were having an out-of-body experience . " Hello , Kinsey . It 's been a long time , " she said . She lifted her face to mine at that point , her gaze dark and snappish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being concentrated now in her eyes . She had high cheekbones and a strong chin . The skin hung from her face like tissue-thin kid leather , lined and seamed , yellowing with the years like a pair of cotillion gloves . Like Ashley , she was big : wide through the shoulders , thick through the waist . Like Ash , too , she might have been a redhead in her youth . Now her hair was a soft puff of white , gathered on top and secured by a series of tortoise-shell combs . Her clothes were beautifully made  --  a softly draped kimono of navy silk over a dark red silk wraparound dress . Ashley helped her into a chair , pulling the tea cart within range so her mother could supervise the pouring of tea . Ash glanced over at me . " Would you prefer sherry ? The tea is Earl Grey . " " Tea 's fine . " Ash poured three cups of tea while Helen selected a little plate of cookies and finger sandwiches for each of us . White bread spread with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with curried chicken salad . Rye layered with herbed cream cheese and lox . There was something about the ritual attention to detail that made me realizeneither of them cared what I was wearing or whether my social status was equivalent to theirs.  |p54Ashley  flashed me a smile when she handed me my tea . " Mother and I live for this , " she said , dimples appearing . " Oh , yes , " Helen said , with a smile . " Food is my last great vice and I intend to sin incessantly as long as my palate holds out . " We munched and sipped tea and laughed and chatted about old times . Helen told me that both she and Woody had sprung from the commonplace . His father had owned a hardware store in town for years . Her father was a stonemason . Each had inherited a modest sum which they 'd pooled to form Wood/Warren some time in the forties . The money they 'd amassed was all fun and games as far as they were concerned . Woody was dead serious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like a happy accident . Helen said he 'd carried nearly two million dollars ' worth of life insurance on himself , considering it a hot joke as it was the only investment he knew of with a guaranteed payoff . At five o'clock , Ash excused herself , leaving the two of us alone . Helen 's manner became brisk . " Now tell me about this business with Lance . " I brought her up-to-date . Ash had apparently filled her in , but Helen wanted to hear it all again from me . " I want you to work for me , " she said promptly when I finished . " I ca n't do that , Helen . For starters , my attorney does n't want meanywhere near Lance , and I certainly ca n't accept employment fromthe Wood family . It already looks like I 'm being paid off . " " I want to know who 's behind this , " she said . " So do I. But suppose it turns out to be one of you . I do n't mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then we 'd have to put a stop to it . I do n't like underhanded dealings , especially when people outside the company are affected . Will you keep me informed ? " " If it 's practical , of course . I 'm willing to share anything I find . For once , I do n't have a client to protect . " " Tell me how I can help . " " Fill me in on the details of Woody 's will , if that 's not too personal . How was his estate divided ? Who controls the company ? " A flash of irritation crossed her face . " That was the only thing we argued about . He was determined to leave the business to Lance , which I did n't disagree with in principle . Of all the children , Lancep55seemed to be the best qualified to carry on once his father was gone . But I felt Woody should have given him the clout to go with it . Woody would n't do it . He absolutely refused to give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the stock , that 's what . I said , Why give him the position if you wo n't give him the power to go along with it ? Let the boy run it his way , for God 's sake , you old goat ! ' But Woody would n't hear of it . Would n't even consider the possibility . I was livid , but that old fool would n't budge . Lord , he could be stubborn when he made his mind up . " " What was he so worried about ? " " He was afraid Lance would run the business into the ground . Lance 's judgment is sometimes faulty . I 'd be the first to admit it . He does n't seem to have a feel for the market like Woody did . He does n't have the relationships with suppliers or customers , not to mention employees . Lance is impetuous and he has very grandiose schemes that never quite pan out . He 's better now , but those last few years before Woody died , Lance would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea he 'd got hold of . While Woody was alive , he could rein him in , but he was petrified that Lance would make a disastrous mistake . " " Why leave him the company in the first place ? Why not put someonehe trusted at the helm ? " " I suggested that myself , but he would n't hear of it . It had to be one of the boys , and Lance was the logical choice . Bass was . . . well , you know Bass . He had no desire to follow in Woody 's footsteps unless they led straight to the bank . " " What about Ebony ? Ash mentioned she was interested . " " I suppose she was , but by the time Woody made out this last will ofhis , she was off in Europe and showed no signs of coming back . " " How was the stock divided ? " " Lance has forty-eight percent . I have nine , our attorney has three percent and Ebony , Olive , Ash , and Bass each have ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's set up so Lance ca n't act alone . To make up a majority , he has to persuade at least one of us that what he 's proposing makes good business sense . For the most part he 's free to do as he sees fit , but we can always rally and outvote him in a pinch . "  | " That must drive him crazy . " " Oh , he hates it , but I must say I begin to see Woody 's point . Lance is young yet and he 's not that experienced . Let him get a few years under his belt and then we 'll see how things stand . " " Then the situation could change ? " " Well , yes , depending on what happens to my shares when I die . Woody left that entirely up to me . All I have to do is leave three shares to Lance . That would make him a majority stockholder . No one could touch him . " " Sounds like the stuff of which soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man if it comes to that . Next to eating , it 's what I enjoy best . " She glanced at the watch that was pinned to her dress , then reached over to the wall and pressed a button that apparentlysignaled the maid somewhere in the house . " Time for my swim . Would you care to join me ? We have extra suits and I 'd enjoy the company . I can still do a mile , but it bores me to death . " " Maybe another time . I tend to be a land animal , given my choice . " I got up and shook her hand . " Tea was lovely . Thanks for the invita-tion . " " Come again , any time . Meanwhile , I 'll see that Ebony and Olive give you any information you need . " " I appreciate that . I 'll see myself out . " As I moved toward the foyer , the maid was returning with a portablewheelchair . Behind her the front door opened , and Ebony came in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must have been twenty-five then , which seemed very mature and sophisticated to me . She still had the power to intimidate . She was tall , rail-thin , high cheekbones , dark-red lipstick . Her hair was jet-black and pulled back dramatically , worn with a bow at her neck . She 'd gone to Europe originally as a fashion model and she still walked like she was whipping down a runway . She 'd been at Cal Poly for two years , had quit , had tried photography , dance , design school , and free-lance journalism before she turned to modeling . She 'd been married maybe six years to a man whose name had recently been linked with Princess Caroline of Monaco . As far as I knew , Ebony had no children and , at forty , seemed an unlikely prospectfor motherhood . She paused when she caught sight of me , and for a moment I wasn'tp57sure if she remembered who I was . She flicked me a chill smile and continued toward the stairs . " Hello , Kinsey . Come upstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was wearing a wide-shouldered black suit , nipped in at the waist , a stark white shirt , knee-high glossy black boots with heels sharp enough to pierce a cheap floor covering . She smelled of a high-powered perfume , dark and intense , faintly unpleasant at close range . A trail of it wafted back at me like diesel fuel . This was going to give me a headache , I could tell . I was already annoyed by her attitude , which was peremptory at best . The second floor was carpeted in pale beige , a wool pile so dense I felt as if we were slogging through dry sand . The hallway was wide enough to accommodate a settee and a massive antique armoire . It surprised me somehow that she was living at home . Maybe , like Ash , she was here temporarily until she found a permanent residence somewhere else . She opened a bedroom door and stepped back , waiting for me to pass in front of her . She should have been a school principal , I thought . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dominance . As soon as I 'd entered the room , she closed the door and leaned against it , still holding onto the knob at the small of her back . Her complexion was fine , loose powder lending a matte finish to her face , like the pale cast of hoarfrost.  |p58There  was an alcove to the left , done up as a little sitting room with a coffee table and two easy chairs . " Sit down , " she said . " Why do n't you just tell me what you want and let 's get on with it ? " She shrugged and crossed the room . She leaned down and plucked a cigarette from the crystal box on the coffee table . She sat down in one of the upholstered chairs . She lit her cigarette . She blew the smoke out . Every gesture was separate and deliberate , designed to call maximumattention to herself . I moved to the door and opened it . " Thanks for the trip upstairs . It 's been swell , " I said , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please . " I paused , looking back at her . " I 'm sorry . I apologize . I know I 'm rude . " " I do n't care if you 're rude , Ebony . Just pick up the pace a bit . " Her smile was wintry . " Please sit , if you would . " I sat down . " Would you like a martini ? " She set her burning cigarette in the ashtray and opened a small refrigerator unit built into the coffee table . She extracted chilled glasses , a jar of pitted green olives , and a bottle of gin . There was no vermouth in sight . Her nails were so long they had to be fake , but they allowed her to extract the olives without getting her fingers wet . She inserted an acrylic tip and pierced the olives one by one , lifting them out . I watched her pour gin with a glint in her eye that suggested a thirst springing straight from her core . She handed me a drink . " What happened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because I 'm curious . The company 's affected by whatever affects him . I want to know what 's going on . " She picked up her cigarette again and took a deep drag . I could tell the nicotine and alcohol were soothing some inner anxiety.  | " He knows as much as I do . Why do n't you ask him ? " " I thought you might tell me , as long as you 're here . " " I 'm not sure that 's such a good idea . He seems to think you 're part of it . " Her smile returned , but it held no mirth . " In this family , I 'm not part of anything . I wish I were . " I felt another surge of impatience . I said , " Jesus , let 's quit fencing . I hate conversations like this . Here 's the deal . Someone set me up and I do n't like it . I have no idea why and I do n't much give a shit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the moment I 'm self-employed , so the only client I have to answer to is me . If you want information , hire a private detective . My services are spoken for . " Her expression hardened like plaster of Paris , dead white . I suspectedif I reached out to touch her , her skin would have had the same catalytic heat . " I hoped you 'd be reasonable . " " What for ? I do n't know what 's going on , and what I 've seen so far , I do n't like . For all I know , you 're at the bottom of this or you know who is . " " You do n't mince words , do you ? " " Why should I mince words ? I do n't work for you . " " I made a simple inquiry . I can see you 've decided to take offense . " She stubbed out her cigarette at the halfway mark . She was right . I was hot and I was n't sure why . I took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for mine . I tried again . " You 're right . I 'm out of line . I did n't think I was pissed off , but clearly I am . Somehow I 've gotten caught up in family politics and that does n't sit well with me . " " What makes you so sure it 's family politics ? Suppose it 's someone outside the company ? " " Like who ? " " We have competitors like anybody else . " She took a sip of her martini and I could see her savor the icy liquid as it flooded through her mouth . Her face was narrow , her features fine . Her skin was flawlessand unlined , giving her the bland expression of a Madame Alexanderdoll . Either she 'd already had plastic surgery or she 'd somehow learned not to have the kind of feelings that leave telltale marks . It was hard to imagine that she and Ash were sisters . Ash was earthy and open with a sunny disposition , generous , good-natured , easygoing , re/laxed . Ebony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aloof , controlled , arrogant . It was possible , I thought , that the differences between them were related , in part , to their relative positions in the family constellation . Ebony was the oldest daughter , Ash the youngest . Woody and Helen had probably expected perfection of their first child . By the time they got down to Ash , and beyond her to Bass , they must have given up expecting anything . Ebony touched the olive in her drink , turning it . She eased the fingernail into the hole and plucked it out , laying the green globe on her tongue . Her lips closed around her finger and she made a faint sucking noise . The gesture had obscene overtones and I wondered suddenly if she was coming on to me . She said , " I do n't suppose you 'll tell me what Mother wanted . " I could feel my temper climb again . " Do n't you people talk to each other ? She invited me for tea . We had a few laughs about old times . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all to you . If you want to know what we talked about , ask her . When I find out what 's going on , I 'll be delighted to dump the whole thing in your lap . In the meantime , I do n't think it 's smart to run around telling everything I know . " Ebony was amused . I could see the corners of her mouth turning up . I stopped what I was saying . " Have you got some kind of problem with that ? " She laughed . " I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to condescend , but you were always like this . All that energy . So fiery and defensive . " I stared at her , stumped for a response . " You 're a professional , " she went on pleasantly . " I understand that . I 'm not asking you to divulge any confidences . This is my family and I 'm concerned about what goes on . That 's my only point . If I can be of any help , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on me , I 'd like to hear about it . Is that so unreasonable ? " " Of course not . Sorry , " I said . I circled back through our conversation , returning to something she 'd said earlier . " You mentioned that the trouble might originate from someone outside the company . Were you talking in general or specific terms ? " She shrugged languidly . " General , really , though I do know of someone who hates us bitterly . " She paused , as though trying to de-tp61cide how to frame her explanation . " There was an engineer who worked for us for many years . A fellow named Hugh Case . Two years ago , a couple of months before my father died , as a matter of fact , he  --  um , killed himself . " " Was there a connection ? " She seemed faintly startled . " With Daddy 's death ? Oh , no . I 'm sure not , but from what I 'm told , Hugh 's wife was convinced Lance was responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to ask someone else for the details . I was in Europe at the time , so I do n't know much except that Hugh shut himself up in his garage and ran his car until he died of carbon monoxide poisoning . " She paused to light another cigarette and then sat for a moment , using the spent match to rake the ash into a neat pile in the ashtray . " His wife felt Lance drove him to it ? " " Not quite . She thought Lance murdered him . " " Oh , come on ! " " Well , he was the one who stood to benefit . There was a rumor floating around at the time that Hugh Case intended to leave Wood/ Warren and start a company of his own in competition with us . He was in charge of research and development , and apparently he was on the track of a revolutionary new process . The desertion could have caused us serious harm . There are only fifteen or so companies nationwidein our line of work so the defection would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous . A man does n't get murdered because he wants to change jobs ! " Ebony arched an eyebrow delicately . " Unless it represents a cripplingfinancial loss to the company he leaves . " " Ebony , I do n't believe this . You 'd sit there and say such a thing about your own brother ? " " Kinsey , I 'm reporting what I heard . I never said I believed it , just that she did . " " The police must have investigated . What did they find ? " " I have no idea . You 'd have to ask them . " " Believe me , I will . It may not connect , but it 's worth checking out . What about Mrs. Case ? Where is she at this point ? " " I heard she left town , but that might not be true . She was a bartender , of all things , in that cocktail lounge at the airport . Maybe theyp62know where she went . Her name is Lyda Case . If she 's remarried or gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you 'd track her down . " " Anybody else you can think of who might want to get to Lance ? " " Not really . " " What about you ? I heard you were interested in the company . Is n't that why you came back ? " " In part . Lance has done some very foolish things since he took over . I decided it was time to come home and do what I could to protect my interests . " " Meaning what ? " " Meaning just what it sounds like . He 's a menace . I 'd like to get him out of there . " " So if he 's charged with fraud , it wo n't break your heart . " " Not if he 's guilty . It would serve him right . I 'm after his job . I make no bones about it , but I certainly would n't need to go about it in an underhanded way , if that 's what you 're getting at , " she said , almost playfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her attitude irritated me . I 'd expected her to be defensive . Instead , she was amused . Part of what offended me in Ebony was the hint of superiority that underscoredeverything she did . Ash had told me Ebony was always considered " fast . " In high school , she 'd been daring , a dazzler and wild , one of those girls who 'd try anything once . At an age when everyone else was busy trying to conform , Ebony had done whatever suited her . " Smoked , sassed adults , and screwed around , " was the way Ash put it . At seventeen she 'd learned not to give a shit , and now she seemed indelibly imprinted with an air of disdain . Her power lay in the fact that she had no desire to please and she did n't care what your opinion of her was . Being with her was exhausting and I was suddenly too tired to press her about the little smile that played across her mouth . It was 6:15 . High tea was n't doing much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famished . Martinis give me a headache anywayand I knew I smelled of secondhand cigarette smoke . I excused myself and headed home , stopping by McDonald 's to chow down a quarter-pounder with cheese , large fries , and a Coke . This was no time to torment my cells with good nutrition , I thought . Ip63finished up with one of those fried pies full of hot glue that burns the fuck out of your mouth . Pure heaven . When I got back to my place , I experienced the same disconcerting melancholy I 'd felt off and on since Henry got on the plane for Michigan . It 's not my style to be lonely or to lament , even for a moment , my independent state . I like being single . I like being by myself . I find solitude healing and I have a dozen ways to feel amused . The problem was I could n't think of one . I wo n't admit to depression , but I was in bed by 8:00 P.M. . . . not cool for a hard-assed private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p64By  1:00 the next afternoon , I had tracked Lyda Case by telephone to a cocktail lounge at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport , where she was simultaneouslytending bar and hanging up in my ear with a force that made me think I 'd have to have my hearing rechecked . Last May I 'd been compelled to shoot someone from the depths of a garbage bin and my ears have been hissing ever since . Lyda did n't help this .. . especially as she said a quite rude word to me before she smacked the phone down . I was deeply annoyed . It had taken me a bit of doing to locate her and she 'd already hung up on me once that day . I 'd started at 10:00 A.M. with a call to the Culinary Alliance and Bartenders Local 498 , which refused to tell me anything . I 've noticed lately that organizations are getting surly about this sort of thing . It used to be you could ring them right up , tell a plausible tale , and get the information you wanted within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addresses , or telephone numbers . You ca n't get service records , bank balances , or verification of employment . Half the time , you ca n't even get confirmation of the facts you already have . Do n't even bother with the public schools , the Welfare Department , or the local jail . They wo n't tell you nothin ' . " That 's privileged , " they say . " Sorry , but that 's an invasion of our client 's privacy . " I hate that officious tone they take , all those clerks and receptionists . They love not telling you what you want to know .. And they 're smart . They do n't fall for the same old song and dance that worked a couple of years ago . It 's too aggravating for words . I reverted to routine . When all else fails , try the county clerk 's office , the public library , or the DMV . They 'll help . Sometimes there 's a small fee involved , but who cares ? I whipped over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I found Hugh and Lyda Case listed . I made a note of the address and then switched to the crisscrossp65and found out who their neighbors had been two years back . I called one after another , generally bullshitting my way down the block . Finally , someone allowed as how Hugh had died and they thought his widow moved to Dallas . It worried me briefly that Lyda Case might be unlisted , but I dialed Information in Dallas and picked up a home phone number right away . Hot damn , this was fun . I tried the number and someone answeredon the third ring . " Hello . " " May I speak to Lyda Case ? " " This is she . " " Really ? " I asked , amazed at my own cleverness . " Who is this ? " Her voice was flat . I had n't expected to get through to her and I had n't yet made up a suitable fib , so I was forced to tell the truth . Big mistake . " My name is Kinsey Millhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . . . . " Bang . I lost some hearing in the mid-range . I called back , but she refused to answer the phone . At this point , I needed to know where she was employed and I could n't afford to call every bar in the Dallas/Fort Worth area , if indeed that 's the sort of work she still did . I tried Information again and picked up the telephone number of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union Local 353 in Dallas . I had my index finger poised to dial when I realized I would need a ruse . I sat and thought for a moment . It would help to have Lyda Case 's Social Security number , which might lend a little air of credibility to my bogus pursuit . Never try to get one of these from the Social SecurityOffice . They 're right up there with banks in their devotion to thwarting you at every turn . I was going to have to get the information through access to public records of some sort . I grabbed my handbag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the courthouse . The Registrar of Voters is located in the basement , down a flight of wide , red tile steps with a handrail made out of antique rope as big around as a boa constrictor . I followed the signs down a short corridor to the right , pushing into the office through a glass door . Two clerks were working behind the counter , but no one paid any attention to me . There was a computerp66terminal on the counter and I typed in Lyda Case 's name . I closed my eyes briefly , offering up a small prayer to whichever of the gods is in charge of bureaucracies . If Lyda had registered to vote any time in the last six years , the revised form would n't show her Social Security number . That question had been deleted in 1976 . The name flashed up , line after line of green print streaking out . Lyda Case had first registered to vote October 14 , 1974 . The number of the original affidavit was listed on the bottom line . I made a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had approached when she saw I needed help . She disappeared into a back corridor where the old files are kept . She returned a few minutes later with the affidavit in hand . Lyda Case 's Social Security number was neatly filled in . As a bonus , I also picked up her date of birth . I started laughing at the sight of it . The clerk smiled and I knew from the look we exchanged that she felt as I did about some things . I love information . Sometimes I feel like an archeologist , digging for facts , uncovering data with my wits and a pen . I made notes , humming to myself . Now I could go to work . I went home again and picked up the phone , redialing the BartendersLocal in Santa Teresa . " Local Four Ninety-eight , " the woman said . " Oh , hi , " said I. " Who am I speaking to , please ? " " I 'm the administrative assistant , " she said primly . " Perhaps you 'll identify yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Vicky with the Chamber of Commerce . I 'm addressing invitations for the annual Board of Supervisors dinner and I need your name , if you 'd be so kind . " There was a dainty silence . " Rowena Feldstaff , " she said , spelling it out for me carefully . " Thank you . " I dialed Texas again . The phone on the other end rang four times while two women in teeny , tiny voices laughed about conditions in the Inky Void . Someone picked up . " Bartenders Local Three Five Three . This is Mary Jane . Can I he'p you ? " She had a soft voice and a mild Texas accent . She sounded like she was about twenty . " You sure can , Mary Jane , " I said . " This is Rowena Feldstaff inp67Santa Teresa , California . I 'm the administrative assistant for BartendersLocal Four Ninety-eight and I 'm trying to do a status check on Lyda Case . That 's C  --  A  --  S  --  E . . . " Then I rattled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though from records of my own . " Can I have a number so I can call you back ? " said the evercautiousMary Jane . " Sure , " I said and gave her my home phone . Within minutes , my phone rang again . I answered as Bartenders Local #498 , and Mary Jane very kindly gave me Lyda Case 's current place of employment , along with the address and phone number . She was working at one of the cocktail lounges at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport . I called the bar and one of the waitresses told me Lyda would be there at 3:00 Dallas time , which was 1:00 where I was . At 1:00 , I called back and lost another couple of decibels ' worth of hearing . Whoo , that lady was quick . I 'd have to walk around with a horn sticking out of my ear at this rate . If I 'd been working off an expense account , I 'd have hied myself out to the Santa Teresa airport and jumped on a plane for Dallas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My own , I think about first , as I 'm very cheap . I hopped in my car and drove over to the police station . Jonah Robb , my usual source of illicit information , was out of town . SergeantSchiffman , sitting in for him , was not all that swift and did n't really like to bend the rules , so I bypassed him and went straight to Emerald , the black clerk in Records and Identification . Technically she 's not supposed to give out the kind of information I needed , but she 's usually willing to help if no one 's around to catch her . I leaned on the counter in the reception area , waiting while she finished typing a department memo . She took her time getting to me , probably sensing that I was up to no good . She 's in her forties , with a medium complexion about the color of a cigar . Her hair is cut very short and it curls tensely around her head , a glistening , wet-looking black with gray frizz at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all solidly packed into her waist , her belly , and her rump . " Uh  --  uhn , " she said to me as she approached . Her voice is higherp68than one would imagine for a woman her size , and it has a nasal cast to it , with just the faintest suggestion of a lisp . " What do you want ? I 'm almost afraid to ask . " She was wearing a regulation uniform , a navy-blue skirt and a white short-sleeved blouse that looked very stark and clean against the tobaccobrown of her arms . The patch on her sleeve said Santa Teresa Police Department , but she 's actually a civilian clerk . " Hello , Emerald . How are you ? " " Busy . You better cut right down to what you want , " she said . " I need you to look something up for me . " " Again ? I 'm gon na get myself fired one of these days because of you . What is it ? " Her tone was offset by a sly smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , two years back , " I said . " The guy 's name was Hugh Case . " She stared at me . Uh  --  oh , I thought . " You know who I 'm talking about ? " " Sure , I know . I 'm surprised you do n't . " " What 's the deal ? I assume it was n't routine . " She laughed at that . " Oh , honey , no way . No waay . Uh  --  un . LieutenantDolan still gets mad when he hears the name . " " How come ? " " How come ? Because the evidence disappeared , that 's how come . I know two people at St. Terry 's got fired over that . " Santa Teresa Hospital , St. Terry 's , is where the hospital morgue is located . " What evidence came up missing ? " I asked . " Blood , urine , tissue samples , the works . His were n't the only specimensdisappeared . The courier picked ' em up that day and took ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw of the whole busi-ness . " " Jesus . What about the body ? Why could n't they just redo the work ? " Emerald shook her head . " Mr. Case 'd been cremated by the time they found out the specimens were missing . Mrs. Case had the **25;15936;TOOLONG ... scattered at sea . " " Oh , shit , you 're kidding . " " No ma'am . Autopsy 'd been done and Dr. Yee already released thep69body to the mortuary . Mrs. Case did n't want any kind of funeral so she gave the order to have him cremated . He was gone . People had a fit . Dr. Yee turned St. Terry 's upside down . Nothing ever did show . Lieutenant Dolan was beside himself . Now I hear they got this whole new policy . Security 's real tight . " " But what was the assumption ? Was it an actual theft ? " " Do n't ask me . Like I said , lot of other stuff disappeared at the same time so the hospital could n't say what went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have thrown all that stuff out by accident and then did n't want to admit it . " " Why was Dolan involved ? I thought it was a suicide . " " You know nobody will make a determination on the manner and cause of death until the reports come back . " " Well , yeah , " I said . " I just wondered if the lieutenant had any initial doubts . " " Lieutenant always has doubts . He 'll have some more he catches you sniffin ' around . Now I got work to do . And do n't you tell nobody I told you this stuff . " I drove over to the Pathology Department at St. Terry 's , where I had a quick chat with one of the lab techs I 'd dealt with before . She confirmed what Emerald had told me , adding a few details about the mechanics of the episode . From what she said , a courier from the coroner 's office did a daily run in a blood-transport vehicle , making a sweep of labs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , labeled and placed in insulated cold packs , like picnic supplies . The " hamper " itself was stored in the lab refrigerator until the driver showed up . The lab tech would fetch the hamper . The courier would sign for the evidence and away he 'd go . The Hugh Case " material , " as she so fastidiously referred to it , was never seen again once it left the hospital lab . Whether it disappeared en route or after it was delivered to the coroner 's lab , no one ever knew . The clerk at St. Terry 's swore she gave it to the driver and she had a signed receipt to show for it . She assumed the hamper reached its destination as it had every day for years . The courier remembered putting it in the vehicle and assumed it was among the items delivered at the end of his run . It was only after some days had passed and Dr. Yee began to press for lab results on the toxicological tests that the disappearance came top70light . By then , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainshad been reduced to ashes and flung to the far winds . I used one of the pay phones in the hospital lobby to call my travel agent and inquire about the next flight to Dallas . There was one seat left on the 3:00 shuttle from Santa Teresa to Los Angeles , arriving at LAX at 3:35 . With a two-hour layover , I could pick up a United flight that would get me into Dallas that night at 10:35 , CST . If Lyda clocked into the bar at 3:00 and worked an eight-hour shift , she should be getting off at 11:00 . A delay at any point in the journey would get me there too late to connect with her . I could n't get a flight back to Santa Teresa until morning anyway , because the airport here shuts down at 11 P.M. I was going to end up spending a night in Dallas in any event . The air fare itself was nearly two hundred bucks , and the notion of paying for a hotel room on top of that made me nearly giddy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways in one of those molded-plastic airport chairs , but I did n't relish the idea . Also , I was n't quite sure how I could contrive to eat on the ten bucks in cash I had on me . I probably could n't even afford to retrieve my VW from the long-term parking lot when I got home again . My travel agent , Lupe , was breathing patiently into my ear while I did these lightning-quick calculations . " I do n't want to bug you , Millhone , but you got about six minutes to make up your mind about this . " I glanced at my watch . It was 2:17 . I said , " Oh hell , let 's go for it . " " Done , " she said . She booked the seats . I charged the tickets to my United credit card which I had just gotten paid off . Curses , I thought , but it had to be done . Lupe said the tickets would be waiting for me at the ticket counter . I hung up , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My handsome travel wardrobe that day consisted of my boots , my ratty jeans , and a cotton turtleneck , navy blue with the sleeves only slightly stretched out of shape . I had an old windbreaker in the back seat of my car . Happily , I had n't used it recently to clean off my windshield . I also keep a small overnight case in the back seat , with a toothbrush and clean underwear . I boarded the plane with twelve minutes to spare and tucked my overnight case under the seat in front of me . The aircraft was small and all fifteen seats were occupied . A hanging curtain separated thep71passengers from the cockpit . Since I was only two seats back , I could see the whole instrument panel , which did n't look any more complicated than the dashboard of a new Peugeot . When the flight attendant saw me rubbernecking , she pulled the curtain across the opening , as if the pilot and copilot were doing something up there we were better off not knowing about . The engines sounded like lawn mowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth when I would wake late to hear my aunt out cutting the grass . Over the din , the intercom system was worthless . I could n't hear a word the pilot said , but I suspected he was reciting that alarming explanation of what to do in the " unlikely " event of a water landing . Most planes crash and burn on land . This was just something new to worry about . I did n't think my seat cushion was going to double as a flotation device of any kind . It was barely adequate to keep my rear end protected from the steel-reinforced framework of the seat itself . While the pilot droned on , I looked at the plastic card with its colorful cartoon depicting the aircraft . Someone had placed two X 's on the diagram . One said , " You are here . " A second X out on the wing tip said , " Toilet is here . " The flight only took thirty-five minutes so the flight attendant , who wore what looked like a Girl Scout uniform , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she whipped down the aisle , passinga little basket of Chiclets chewing gum in tiny boxes . I spent the flight time trying to get my ears to unpop , looking , I 'm sure , like I was suffering from some kind of mechanical jaw disease . My United flight left right on time . I sat in the no-smoking section being serenaded by a duet of crying babies . Lunch consisted of a fist of chicken breast on a pile of rice , covered with what looked like rubber cement . Dessert was a square of cake with a frosting that smelled like Coppertone . I ate every bite and tucked the cellophane-wrapped crackers in my purse . Who knew when I 'd get to eat again . Once we landed in Dallas , I grabbed up my belongings and eased my way toward the front of the plane as we waited for the jetway to thump against the door . The stewardess released us like a pack of noisy school kids and I dogtrotted toward the gate . By the time I actually hit the terminal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for was in another satellite , typically about as far away as youp72could get . I started running , grateful , as usual , that I keep myself fit . I reached the bar at 11:02 . Lyda Case had left . I 'd missed her by five minutes and she was n't scheduled to work again until the weekend . I wo n't repeat what I said.  |p73I  had Lyda paged . I had passed a Traveler 's Aid station , an L-shaped desk , where the airline-terminal equivalent of a candy-striper was posted . This woman was in her fifties , with an amazingly homely face : gaunt and chinless , with one eye askew . She was wearing a Salvation Army uniform , complete with brass buttons and epaulets . I was n't sure what the deal was . Maybe distraught mothers of lost toddlers and foreign-speaking persons in need of Kaopectate were meant to gamer spiritual comfort along with the practical kind . She was just shutting down her station for the night , and at first she did n't seem to appreciatemy request for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew in from California to speak with a woman who 's on her way out of the terminal . I 've got to catch her before she hits the parking lot , and I have no idea which exit she 's using . Is there any way to have her paged ? " The woman fixed me with the one eye while the other moved to the one-page directory she kept taped to her desk top . Without a word , she picked up the phone and dialed . " What 's the name ? " she asked . " Lyda Case . " She repeated the name and within moments , I heard Lyda Case being paged to the Traveler 's Aid station , terminal 2 . I was profuse in my thanks , though she did n't seem to require much in the way of appreciation . She finished packing up and , with a brief word , departed . I had no idea if Lyda Case would show . She might have been out of the building by the time her name was called . Or she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reason . On an impulse , I rounded the desk and sat down in the chair . A man passed with a rolling suitcase that trailed after him reluctantly , like a dog on its way to the vet . I glanced at my watch . Twelve minutes had passed . I checked the top desk drawer , which was unlocked . Pencils , pads of paper , tins of aspirin , cellophane-wrapped tissue , a **29;15963;TOOLONG . I read the list of useful phrases inside the back cover . " Buenas tardes , " I murmured to myself . " Buenas noches . " Good nachos . I was starving to death . " Somebody paging me ? I heard my name on the public-address system and it said to come here . " The accent was Texan . Lyda Case was standing with her weight on one hip . Petite . No makeup . All freckles and frizzy hair . She was dressed in dark slacks and a matchingvest  --  one of those all-purpose bartender uniforms that you can probably order wholesale from the factory . Her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond-crusted watch , and in her right hand she held a lighted cigarette , which she dropped and crushed underfoot . " What 's the matter , baby ? Did I come to the wrong place ? " Midthirties . Lively face . Straight little nose and a sharp , defiant chin . Her smile revealed crooked eyeteeth and gaps where her first molars should have been . Her parents had never gone into debt for her orthodontiawork . I got up and held my hand out . " Hello , Mrs. Case . How are you ? " She allowed her hand to rest in mine briefly . Her eyes were the haunting , surreal blue of contact lenses . Distrust flickered across the surface . " I do n't believe I know you . " " I called from California . You hung up on me twice . " The smile drained away . " I thought I made it clear I was n't interested . I hope you did n't fly all this way on my account . " " Actually , I did . You 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm hoping you 'll spare me a few minutes . Is there some place we can go to talk ? " " This is called talkin ' where I come from , " she snapped . " I meant , privately . " " What about ? " " I 'm curious about your husband 's death . " She stared at me . " You some kind of reporter ? " " Private detective . " " Oh , that 's right . You mentioned that on the phone . Who all are you working for ? " " Myself at the moment . An insurance company before that . I was investigating a warehouse fire at Wood/Warren when Hugh 's namep75came up . I thought you might fill me in on the circumstances of his death . " I could see her wrestling with herself , tempted by the subject . It was probably one of those repetitious nighttime tales we tell ourselves when sleep eludes us . Somehow I imagined there were grievances she recited endlessly as the hours dragged by from 2:00 to 3:00 . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's usually in a chatty mood . " What 's Hugh got to do with it ? " " Maybe nothing . I do n't know . I thought it was odd his lab work disappeared . " " Why worry about it ? No one else did . " " It 's about time then , do n't you think ? " She gave me a long look , sizing me up . Her expression changed from sullenness to simple impatience . " There 's a bar down here . I got somebody waiting so I 'll have to call home first . Thirty minutes . That 's all you get . I worked my butt off today and I want to rest my dogs . " She moved off and I followed , trotting to keep up . We sat in captain 's chairs at a table near the window . The night sky was thick with low clouds . I was startled to realize it was raining outside . The plate glass was streaked with drops blown sideways by a buffeting wind . The tarmac was as glossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the apron , pebbled with raindrops . Three DC-10s were lined up at consecutive gates . The area swarmed with tow tractors , catering vehicles , boom trucks , and men in yellow slickers . A baggage trailer sped by , pulling a string of carts piled high with suitcases . As I watched , a canvas duffel tumbled onto the wet pavement , but no one seemed to notice . Somebody was going to spend an irritating hour filling out " Missing Baggage " claim forms tonight . While Lyda went off to make her phone call , I ordered a spritzer for me and a Bloody Mary for her , at her request . She was gone a long time . The waitress brought the drinks , along with some Eagle Snack pretzels in a can . " Lyda wanted somethin ' to snack on , so I brought you these , " she said . " Can we run a tab ? " " Sure thing . I 'm Elsie . Give a holler if you need anything else . " Ground traffic was clearing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane nearest us . On the runway beyond , an L-1011 lum/bered by with a stripe of lighted windows along its length . The bar was beginning to empty , but the smoke still sat on the air like a visible smudge on a photograph . I heard high heels clopping toward the table , and Lyda was back . She 'd peeled off her vest , and her white blouse was now unbuttoned to a point just between her breasts . Her chest was as freckled as a bird 's egg and it made her look almost tanned . " Sorry it took me so long , " she said . " I got this roommate in the middle of a nervous breakdown , or so she thinks . " She used her celery stalk to stir the pale cloud of vodka into the peppered tomato juicedown below . Then she popped the top off the can of pretzels . " Here , turn your hand up and lemme give you some , " she said . I held my hand out and she filled my palm with tiny pretzels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt . Her hostility had vanished . I 'd seen that before  --  people whose mistrust takes the form of aggressiveness at first , their resistance like a wall in which a sudden gate appears . She 'd decided to talk to me and I suppose she saw no point in being rude . Besides , I was buying . With ten bucks in my pocket , I could n't afford more than thirty minutes ' worth of drinks anyway . She had taken out a compact and she checked her makeup , frowningat herself . " God . I am such a mess . " She plunked her bag up on the table and rooted through until she found a cosmetics pouch . She unzipped it and took out various items , and then proceeded to transformherself before my very eyes . She dotted her face with liquid foundation and smoothed it on , erasing freckles , lines , discolorations . She took out an eyeliner and inked in her upper and lower lids , then brushed her lashes with mascara . Her eyes seemed to leap into prominence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contour of her mouth with dark red and then filled her lips in with a lighter shade . Less than two minutes passed , but by the time she glanced at me again , the rough edges were gone and she had all the glamour of a magazine ad . " What do you think ? " " I 'm impressed . " " Oh , honey , I could make you over in a minute . You ought to do a little more with yourself . That hair of yours looks like a dog 's back-end. "  |p77I  laughed . " We better get down to business if thirty minutes is all I get . " She waved dismissively . " Do n't worry about that . I changed my mind . Betsy 's workin ' on an overdose and I do n't feel like going home yet . " " Your roommate took an overdose ? " " She does that all the time , but she never can get it right . I think she got a little booklet from the Hemlock society and takes half what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have to deal with it . I truly hate paramedics trooping through my place after midnight . They 're all twenty-six years old and so clean-cut it makes you sick . Lot of times she 'll date one afterwards . She swears it 's the only way to meet nurturing men . " I watched while she drained half her Bloody Mary . " Tell me about Hugh , " I said . She took out a pack of chewing gum and offered me a piece . When I shook my head , she unwrapped a stick and doubled it into her mouth , biting down . Then she lit a cigarette . I tried to imagine the combination . . . mint and smoke . It was an unpleasant notion even vicariously . She wadded up the gum wrapper and dropped it in the ashtray . " I was just a kid when we met . Nineteen . Tending bar . I went out to California on the Greyhound bus the day I turned eighteen , and went to bartending school in Los Angeles . Cost me six hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to mix drinks but I probably could have done that out of one of them little books . Anyway , I got this job at LAX and I 've been working airport bars ever since . Do n't ask me why . I just got stuck somehow . Hugh came in one night and we got talkin ' and next thing I knew , we fell in love and got married . He was thirty-nine years old to my nineteen , and I was with him sixteen years . I knew that man . He did n't kill himself . He would n't do that to me . " " What makes you so sure ? " " What makes you sure the sun 's coming up in the east ever ' day ? It just does , that 's all , and you learn to count on that the way I learned to count on him . " " You think somebody killed him ? " " ' Course I do . Lance Wood did it , as sure as I 'm sittin ' here , butp78he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will his family . Have you talked to them ? " " Some , " I said . " I heard about Hugh 's death for the first time yesterday . " " I always figured they paid off the cops to keep it hush . They got tons of money and they know ever'one in town . It was a cover-up . " " Lyda , these are honorable people you 're talking about . They 'd never tolerate murder and they would n't protect Lance if they thought he had anything to do with it . " " Boy , you 're dumber than I am , if you believe that . I 'm tellin ' you it was murder . Why 'd you fly all this way if you did n't think so your-self ? " " I do n't know what to think . That 's why I 'm asking you . " " Well , it was n't suicide . He was n't depressed . He was n't the suicidal type . Why would he do such a thing ? That 's just dumb . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . " I watched her carefully . " I heard he was planning to leave the company and start a business of his own . " " He talked about that . He talked about a lot of things . He worked for Woody fifteen years . Hugh was loyal as they come , but everybody knew the old man meant to leave the company to Lance . Hugh could n't stand the idea . He said Lance was a boob and he did n't want to be around to watch him mess up . " " Did the two of them have words ? " " I do n't know for sure . I know he gave notice and Woody talked him out of it . He 'd just bid on a big government contract and he needed Hugh . I guess Hugh said he 'd stay until word came through whether Woody got the bid or not . Two days later , I got home from work , opened the garage door , and there he was . It looked like he fell asleep in the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that . " " There 's no way it could have been an accident ? " She leaned forward earnestly . " I said it once and I 'll say it again . Hugh would n't kill himself . He did n't have a reason and he was n't depressed . " " How do you know he was n't holding something back ? " " I guess I do n't , if you put it like that . " " The notion of murder does n't make any sense . Lance was n't evenp79in charge at that point , and he would n't kill an employee just because the guy wants to move on . That 's ludicrous . " Lyda shrugged , undismayed by my skepticism . " Maybe Lance worriedHugh would take the business with him when he went . " " Well , aside from the fact he was n't gone yet , it still seems ex-treme . " She bristled slightly . " You asked for my opinion . I 'm tellin ' you what I think . " " I can see you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to talk me into it . If Hugh was murdered , it could have been someone else , could n't it ? " " Of course it could . I believe it was Lance , but I ca n't swear to it . Ido n't have any proof , anyhow . Sometimes I think it 's not worth foolin ' with . It 's over and done , so what difference does it make ? " I shifted the subject . " Why 'd you have him cremated so fast ? " She stared at me . " Are you thinking I had a hand in it ? " " I 'm just asking the questions . What do I know ? " " He asked to be cremated . It was n't even my idea . He 'd been dead for two days . The coroner released the body and the funeral director suggested we go ahead with it , so I took his advice . You can talk to him yourself if you do n't believe me , " she said . " Hugh was drugged . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His lab work was stolen so nobody 'd see the test results . " " Maybe he was drunk , " I suggested . " He might have pulled into the garage and fallen asleep . " She shook her head . " He did n't drink . He 'd given that up . " " Did he have a problem with alcohol ? " " Once upon a time , he did , " she said . " We met in a bar . Two in the afternoon , in the middle of the week . He was n't even travelin ' . He just liked to come watch the planes , he said . I should have suspected right then , but you know what it 's like when you fall in love . You see what you want to see . It took me years to figure out how far gone he was . Finally I said I 'd leave him if he did n't straighten up . He went into this program . . . not AA , but something similar . He got sobered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a chance he 'd gone back to drinking ? It would n't be unheardof . " " Not with him on Antabuse . He'da been sick as a pup. "  | " You 're sure he took the stuff ? " " I gave it to him myself . It was like a little game we played . Every morning with his orange juice . He held his hand out and I gave him his pill and watched him swallow it right down . He wanted me to see he did n't cheat . He swore , the day he quit drinking , he 'd never go back to it . " " How many people knew about the Antabuse ? " " I do n't know . He never made a big deal of it . If people around him were drinking , he just said No thanks . ' " " Tell me what was happening the week he died . " " Nothing . It seemed like an ordinary week to me . He talked to Woody . Two days later , he was dead . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U-Haul , and hit the road for home . This is where I 've been ever since . " " And there was nothing among his things to suggest what was going on ? No letter ? A note ? " She shook her head . " I went through his desk the day he died , and I did n't see a thing . "  |p81The  flight home was uneventful . I 'd spent an hour and a half with Lyda , and the rest of the night in the airport terminal with its red carpeting , high glass ceiling , real trees , and an actual bird that flew back and forth , chirping incessantly . It was sort of like camping out , only I was sitting upright and I did n't have any weenies to roast . I made notes of my conversation with Lyda , which I 'd transcribe for the files when I got home . I was inclined to believe Hugh Case had been murdered , though I had no idea how , why , or by whom . I also tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though I could n't imagine what the connection might be . Lyda had promised to get in touch if she remembered anything of note . All in all , it was not an unproductive trip . It had generated more questions than it answered , but that was fine with me . As long as there are threads to unravel , I 'm in business . The frustration starts when all the leads dry up and the roads turn out to be dead ends . With Hugh Case , I felt like I 'd just found one of the corner pieces of a jigsaw puzzle . I had no idea what the final picture would look like , but at least I had a place to start . I boarded the plane at 4:30 A.M. and arrived at LAX at 5:45 . I had to wait for a 7:00 A.M. shuttle to Santa Teresa , and by the time I dragged my sorry ass home , I was dead on my feet . I let myself into the apartment an hour later , checked for messages ( none ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds of my quilt , fully dressed . At approximately 9:02 , there was a knock at my door . I staggered up out of sleep and shuffled to the door , dragging my quilt behind me like a bridal train . My mouth tasted foul and my hair was standing straight up , as spiky as a punker 's , only not as clean . I peered through the fish-eye , too clever to be caught unawares by an early-morning thug . Standing on my doorstep was my second ex-husband , Daniel Wade . " Shit , " I murmured . Briefly , I leaned my head against the door andp82then peeked again . All I could see in truncated form was his face in profile , blond hair curling around his head like an aura . Daniel Wade is quite possibly the most beautiful man I 've ever seen  --  a bad sign . Beautiful men are usually either gay or impossibly narcissistic . ( Sorry for the generalization , folks , but it 's the truth . ) I like a good face or an interesting face or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . . . the straight , well-proportioned nose , high cheekbones , strong jawline , sturdy chin . His hair was sun-bleached , his eyes a remarkable shade of blue , offset by dark lashes . His teeth were straight and very white , his smile slightly crooked . Get the picture , troops ? I opened the door . " Yes ? " " Hi . " " Hello . " I gave him a rude stare , hoping he 'd disappear . He 's tall and slim and he can eat anything without gaining weight . He stood there in faded jeans and a dark-red sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up . His skin had a golden sheen , tanned and windburned , so his cheeks glowed darkly . Just another boring California golden boy . The hair on his arms was bleached nearly white . His hands were tucked in his pockets , which was just as well . He 's a jazz pianist with long bony fingers . I fell in love with his hands first and then worked my way up . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . just in case his other virtues fail to excite . Reedy and low . He sings like an angel , plays six instruments . " What brought you back ? " " I do n't know . Homesick , I guess . A friend of mine was heading this way so I tagged a ride . Did I wake you up ? " " No , I often walk around looking like this . " A slight smile here , perfectly timed . His manner seemed hesitant , which was unusual for him . He was searching the sight of me , looking ( perhaps ) for some evidence of the girl I used to be . " I like the haircut , " he said . " Gee , this is fun . I like yours , too . " " I guess I caught you at a bad time . I 'm sorry about that . " " Uh , Daniel , could we skip to the punch line here ? I 'm operating on an hour 's sleep and I feel like shit . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind my response was tender instead of downright rude . " I wanted you top83know I 'm clean , " he said . " I have been for a year . No drugs . No drinking . It has n't been easy , but I really have straightened up . " " Super . I 'm thrilled . It 's about bloody time . " " Could you knock off the sarcasm ? " " That 's my natural way of speaking ever since you left . It 's real popular with men . " He rocked slightly on his heels , looking off across the yard . " I guess people do n't get a second chance with you . " I did n't bother to respond to that . He tried a new tack . " Look . I have a therapist named Elise . She was the one who suggested I clean up the unfinished business in my life . She thought maybe you might benefit , too . " " Oh , hey . That 's swell . Give me her address and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in ? " " Jesus Christ , Daniel , of course not ! Do n't you get it yet ? I have n't seen you for eight years and it turns out that 's not long enough . " " How can you be so hostile after all this time ? I do n't feel bad about you . " Why would you feel bad ? I did n't do anything to you ! " A look of injury crossed his face and his bewilderment seemed genuine . There 's a certain class of people who will do you in and then remain completely mystified by the depth of your pain . He shifted his weight . This apparently was n't going as he thought it would . He reached up to pick at a wood splinter in the door frame above my head . " I did n't think you 'd be bitter . That 's not like you , Kinsey . We had some good years . " " Year . Singular . Eleven months and six days , to be exact . You might move your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved his hand . I slammed the door and went back to bed . After a few minutes , I heard the gate squeak . I thrashed about for a while , but it was clear I would n't get back to sleep . I got up and brushed my teeth , showered , shampooed my hair , shaved my legs . I used to have fantasies about his showing up . I used to invent long monologues in which I poured out my sorrow and my rage . Now I was wishing he 'd come back again so I could do a better job of it . Being rejected is burdensome that way . You 're left withp84emotional baggage you unload on everyone else . It 's not just the fact of betrayal , but the person you become . . . usually not very nice . Jonah had survived my tartness . He seemed to understand it had nothing to do with him . He was so blunt himself that a little rudeness did n't bother him . For my part , I really thought I 'd made my peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I called Olive Kohler and made an appointment to see her later in the day . Then I sat down at my desk and typed up my notes . At noon , I decided to get some errands done . Daniel was sitting in a car parked just behind mine . He was slouched down in the passenger seat , his booted feet propped up on the dashboard , a cowboy hat tilted over his face . The car was a ten-year-old Pinto , dark blue , dented , rusted , and stripped of its hubcaps . The sheepskin car-seat covers looked like badly matted dog . A decal on the bumper indicated that the car was from Rent-A-Ruin . Daniel must have heard the gate squeak as I came out . He turned his head , pushing his hat back lazily . He sometimes affects that awshucksattitude . " Feeling better ( Miss Kitty ) ? " I unlocked my car and got in , started the engine and pulled away . I avoided the apartment for the rest of the day . I ca n't remember now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resented the fact that I was not only out an office but banned from my own residence . At 5:00 , with the aid of a street map , I found the Kohlers ' house on an obscure leafy lane in Montebello . The property was hidden by a ten-foot hedge , the driveway barred by an electronically controlled wrought-iron gate . I parked out on the street and let myself in through a wooden gate embedded in the shrubbery . The house was a two-story , English Tudor style , with a steeply pitched shingled roof , half-timberedgables , and a handsome pattern of vertical beams across the front . The lot was large , shaded with sycamores and eucalyptus trees as smooth and gray as bare concrete . Dark-green ivy seemed to grow everywhere . A gardener was visible , trimming the shrubs into animal shapes , a graduate of the Walt Disney school of landscape maintenance . The newspaper was resting on the doormat . I picked it up and then I rang the bell . I expected a maid , but Olive opened the door herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd mostly seen those inp85Joan Crawford movies , and they looked like they 'd be a trick to wear . I had brief visions of plopping around my apartment in backless bedroomslippers . Cigarette holder . Marcelled hair . I could have my eyebrowsplucked back to tiny slits . " Hello , Kinsey . Come in . Terry 's on his way . I forgot we were due at a cocktail party at six . " She stepped away from the door and I followed her in . " We can do this another time if you like , " I said . I handed her the paper . " Thanks . No , no . This is fine . It 's not for an hour anyway and the people do n't live far . I 've got to finish dressing , but we can talk in here . " She glanced at the paper briefly and then tossed it on the hall table next to a pile of mail . She clattered her way along the dark stone-tile hallway toward the master suite at the rear of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunt-cut and thick . I wondered sometimes if Ash was the only sister whose hair remained its natural shade . Olive 's eyes were bright blue , her lashes black , her skin tone gold . She was thirty-three or so , not as brittle as Ebony , but with none of Ash 's warmth . She was talking back over her shoulder to me . " I have n't seen you for ten years . What have you been up to ? " " Setting up my own agency , " I said . " Married ? Kids ? " " No , on both counts . You have kids ? " She laughed . " God forbid . " The bedroom we entered was spacious . Beamed ceiling , big stone fireplace , French doors opening onto a walled-in patio where a small deck had been added on . I could see a round two-person hot tub , surrounded by ferns . A white Persian cat was curled up on a chaise , its face tucked into the circling plume of its tail . The bedroom floor was polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably came from yaks . The entire wall behind the bed was mirrored and I flashed on an image of Terry Kohler 's sexual performances . What did Olive stare at , I wondered , while he watched himself ? I glanced at the ceiling , checking to see if there was a cartoon tacked up there , like the one in my gynecologist 's examining room : " Smile . It gives your face something to do ! " This does not amuse . I eased into an easy chair and watched while Olive moved into ap86walk-in closet the size of a two-car garage . Quickly she began to sort through a rack of evening clothes , rejecting sequined outfits , floorlengthorganza gowns , beaded jackets with long , matching skirts . I could see an assortment of shoes stacked in clear plastic boxes on the shelf overhead , and at one end of the rack , several fur coats of various lengths and types . She selected a knee-length cocktail dress with spaghettistraps and returned to the bedroom where she scrutinized her reflection . The dress was avocado green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? " she said , eyes still pinned to her own image in the glass . " Makes you look green . " She stared at herself , squinting critically . " You 're right . Here . You take this . I never liked it anyway . " She tossed the dress on the bed . " I do n't wear clothes like that , " I said uncomfortably . " Take it . We 'll have a New Year 's Eve party and you can wear it then . " She pulled out a black taffeta dress cut straight across the front . She stepped into it , then zipped it up the back in a motion that snapped everything into place . She was so slender I did n't see how the globelike breasts could possibly be hers . She looked like she 'd had softballs surgically implanted on her chest . Hug a woman like that and she was bound to leave dents . She sat down on the dressing-table bench and pulled on black panty hose , then slipped her feet into four-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flawless skin , the pale-blond hair brushing against her bare shoulders . She sorted through her jewelry box and selected clip-on diamond earrings shaped like delicate silver branches hung with sparkling fruit . She returned to the closet and emerged in a soft , white fur coat the same length as the dress . When she pulled the coat around her , she looked like a flasher decked out in white fox . She half-smiled when she caught my look . " I know what you 're thinking , sweetie , but they were already dead when I got to the furrier 's . Whether or not I bought the coat had no affect on their fates . " " If women did n't wear them , they would n't be killed in the first place , " I said . " Oh , bullshit . Do n't kid yourself . In the wild , these animals get torn to shreds every day . Why not preserve the beauty , like a piece of art ?  |p87The  world 's a vicious place . I do n't pretend otherwise . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly . She pointed a finger . " You came to talk , so talk . " She slipped the coat off and tossed it on the bed , then sat down on the bench and crossed her legs . She eased off one high heel and let her shoe flap against the bottom of her foot . I said , " How much do you know about the situation at Wood/ Warren ? " She gestured impatiently . " Business is a bore . I use that section of the paper to line the cat box . " " You have no interest in the family split ? " " What split ? You mean with Lance ? I have nothing invested one way or the other . He and Ebony disagree . She wants me to vote with her . The way she explains it , it 's to my advantage . Lance will have a fit , of course , but who gives a shit ? He 's had his chance . " " You 're siding with her ? " " Who knows ? Probably . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new blood . He 's got his head in the toilet half the time . " " Meaning what ? " " Let me give you the lowdown on my brother , honey-bun . He 's a salesman at heart . He can charm your socks off when it suits him . He 's enthusiastic about anything that interests him , which is n't much . He has no head for figures . Absolutely none . He hates sitting in an office and he ca n't stand routine . He 's good at generating business and lousy at follow-through . End transmission . " " You 've seen this firsthand or is this Ebony 's claim ? " " I hear about what happens at the plant every day . Terry 's a workaholicand most of what he talks about is business . " " How do he and Lance get along ? " " They knock heads all the time . Terry 's obsessive . It drives him crazy when people fuck up . Excuse the scientific term . Lance has poor judgment . Everyone knows that . Meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about the rest of the family ? Ca n't they vote him out ? " " Nope . The rest of us combined only own forty-nine percent of the stock . Ebony wants to put the squeeze on him , but she ca n't actually force him out . She can bring him to heel , which I suspect is what she wants . " " I take it Bass is n't involved since he lives in New York . "  | " He shows up for board meetings occasionally . He enjoys playing mogul , but he 's harmless enough . He and Lance are usually thick . " " Who will Ashley side with ? " " She could go either way . Obviously , Ebony 's hoping she can persuadeus all to mutiny . " " How does your mother feel ? This could n't sit well with her . " " She hates it . She wants Lance in charge . Not because he 's good , but because it 's less hassle . " " Do you think he 's honest ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you and he get along ? " " I ca n't stand him . He 's a very tense person and he 's s0000 paranoid . I hate to be round him . He gets on my nerves . He 's my brother and I love him , do n't get me wrong . I just do n't like him much . " She wrinkled her nose . " He always smells like garlic and sweat and that nasty Brut cologne . I do n't know why men wear it . Such a turnoff . " " Have you heard any gossip about the warehouse blaze ? " " Just what Terry 's told me . You know Lance borrowed money against the company two years ago and now he 's losing his shirt . He 'd love half a million bucks . " " Oh really . That 's the first I heard of it . " She shrugged carelessly . " He went into the printing business , which is foolish in itself . I 've heard printing and restaurants are the quickest way to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or is that the point ? " " Why do n't you tell me ? " She rested her elbow on her knee and propped her chin up on her fist . " If you 're looking for answers , I 've just run out . I do n't care about Lance . I do n't care about Wood/Warren , to tell you the truth . Sometimesthe politics amuse me in a soap-opera kind of way , like Dynasty , but it 's still boring stuff . " " What do you care about ? " " Tennis . Travel . Clothes . Golf . What else is there ? " " Sounds like a fun life . " " Actually , it is . I entertain . I do charity work when I have the time . There are people who think I 'm a spoiled , lazy bitch , but I have what I want . That 's more than most can say . It 's the have-nots who wreak havoc . I 'm a real pussycat. "  | " You 're fortunate . " " Like they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pay a price , believe me . " I could see what an exhausting proposition that must be . We heard someone at the entrance , then footsteps along the hall . By the time Terry Kohler reached the bedroom door , he was already in the process of removing his coat and tie . " Hello , Kinsey . Olive mentioned you 'd be stopping by . Let me grab a quick shower and then we can talk . " He looked at Olive . " Could you fetch us a drink ? " he said , his tone peremptory . She did n't exactly perk up and pant , but that 's the impression she gave . Maybe her job was harder than I thought . I would n't do that for anyone.  |p90I  waited in the living room while Olive stepped into the kitchen . The place was handsome ; beveled windowpanes , pecan paneling , a fieldstonefireplace , traditional furniture in damask and mahogany . Everythingwas rose and dusty pink . The room smelled faintly spicy , like carnations . I could n't imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conventional good taste , there was no indication that they listened to music or read books . No evidence of shared interests . There was a current copy of Architectural Digest on the coffee table , but it looked like a prop . I 've never known rich people to read Popular Mechanics , Family Circle , or Road &; Track . Come to think of it , I have no idea what they do at night . Olive returned in ten minutes with a tray of hors d'oeuvres and a silver cooler with a wine bottle nestled in ice . Her entire manner had changed since Terry walked in the door . She still had an air of elegance , but her manner was tinged now with servitude . She fussed with small linen cocktail napkins , arranging them in a pattern near the serving plate she 'd placed at one end of the coffee table . She 'd preparedripe figs stuffed with mascarpone cheese , triangles of phyllo , and chilled new potato halves topped with sour cream and caviar . If I called this my dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed briskly to a sideboard and set out liquor bottles so we 'd have a choice of drinks . The room was beginning to darken and she turned on two table lamps . The panels of her taffeta skirt made a silky scritching sound every time she moved . Her legs were well-muscledand the spike heels threw her calves into high relief . I glanced over to see Terry standing in the doorway , freshly showeredand dressed , his gaze lingering on the picture she presented . He caught my eye , smiling with the barest suggestion of proprietorship . He did n't look like an easy man to please . " Gorgeous house , " I said . Olive looked over with a rare smile . " Thanks , " she said.  | " Have a seat , " he said . " I do n't want to hold you up . " Terry waved dismissively , as if the pending conversation took precedence . The gesture had the same ingratiating effect as someone who tells his secretary to hold all the calls . It 's probably bullshit . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it gives the visitor a feeling of importance . " He 'd never pass up a chance to talk business , " Olive said . She handed him a martini and then glanced at me . " What would you like ? " " The white wine , if I may . " While I looked on , she opened the bottle , pouring a glass for me and then one for herself . She handed me mine and then eased out of her shoes and took a seat on the couch , tucking her feet up under her . She seemed softer , less egotistical . The role of helpmeet suited her , which surprised me , somehow . She was a woman who had no apparent purposebeyond indulging herself and pampering " her man . " The notion seemed outdated in a world of career women and supermoms . Terry perched on the arm of the couch , staring at me with guarded interest . He took charge of the conversation , a move he must have been accustomed to . His dark eyes gave his narrow face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made only an occasional digital reference to the fact of his moustache . I 've seen men who stroke their facial hair incessantly , as if it were the last remnant of a baby bunting , comforting and soft . " Lance says someone tried to frame you , " he said . He ate a new-potato half and passed the plate to me . " Looks that way , " I said . I helped myself to a fig . Heaven on the tongue . " What do you need from us ? " " For starters , I 'm hoping you can fill me in on Ava Daugherty . " " Ava ? Sure . What 's she got to do with it ? " " She was there the day I did the fire-scene inspection . She also saw Heather give me the envelope full of inventory sheets , which have since disappeared . " His gaze shifted and I watched him compose his reply before he spoke . " As far as I know , Ava 's straight as an arrow . Hardworking , honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How does she get along with him ? "  | " I 've never heard them exchange a cross word . He 's the one who hired her , as a matter of fact , when it was clear we needed an office manager . " " How long ago was that ? " " God , it must be two , three years now , " he said . He looked down at Olive , sitting close by . " What 's your impression ? Am I reporting accu-rately ? " Olive shrugged . " Well , I would n't say she 's crazy about him . She thinks he plays too much when he ought to be getting work done , but I do n't think she 'd devise any scheme to do him in . " Olive passed the hors d'oeuvre tray to me . I thought it only gracious to sample somethingelse so I selected a potato half and popped it in my mouth . " Who might ? " I asked , licking sour cream from my thumb . This shit was great . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have a go at the rest . Both seemed to come up blank . " Come on . He must have enemies . Somebody 's gone to a lot of trouble over this , " I said . Terry said , " At the moment , I could n't name one , but we can give it some thought . Maybe something will occur to us . " " What can you tell me about the Wood/Warren engineer who killed himself ? " " Hugh Case , " Olive said . Terry seemed surprised . " What brought that up ? I just got a call from Lyda Case this afternoon . " " Really ? " I said . " What did she have to say ? " " It was n't what she said so much as her attitude . She was completelyfreaked out , screaming at the top of her lungs . Said his death was my fault . " Olive looked at him in disbelief . " Yours ? What bullshit ! Why would she say that ? " " I have no idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrill . " " That 's curious , " I said . " Is she here in town ? " Terry shook his head . " She did n't say . The call was long distance from the sound of it . Where 's she live ? " " Dallas , I believe . "  | " I got the impression she intended to fly out . Do you want to talk to her if she shows up ? " " Yes , I 'd like that , " I said , careful to omit any reference to the fact that I 'd met with her the night before . She had n't seemed paranoid to me at all and she 'd never mentioned Terry 's name . Olive stirred on the couch , shifting positions . " Just in time for New Year 's . Everyone 'll be here . " She glanced at Terry . " Did I tell you Bass gets in tonight ? " A look of annoyance flashed across his face . " I thought he was broke . I hope you did n't pay his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends him money , but you would n't catch me doing it , " she remarked . And then to me , " Bass and I had a falling-out at Thanksgiving and we have n't spoken since . He 's got a big mouth in matters that are none of his business . I think he 's loathsome , and he 's just about that fond of me . " Terry glanced at his watch and I took that as my cue . " I should let you go if you 've got a party , " I said . " I do n't feel we 've been any help , " Olive said . " Do n't worry about it . I 've got other sources . Just let me know if you come up with anything you think might pertain . " I left my card on the coffee table . Terry walked me to the door while Olive excused herself to fetch her coat . He watched her disappear into the bedroom . " I did n't want to mention this in front of her , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me this afternoon . " " How so ? " " I do n't want to make Olive nervous , but the woman threatened me . I do n't think it has anything to do with Lance or I 'd have said so up front . This is different . I do n't know what it 's about , but she really sounded cracked . " " What kind of threat ? " I asked . " Out of nowhere , she asked me how old I 'd be on my next birthday . I did n't know what she was getting at , but when I told her I 'd be forty-six , she said , Do n't count on it . ' And then she laughed like a fiend . Jesus , the sound made my blood run cold . I ca n't believe she was serious , but my God ! What a thing to say . " " And you have no idea why she suddenly got in touch ? " " I have n't talked to her for years . Since Hugh died , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about the manner of his death . " " I 've heard that too and I do n't know what to think . " " How well did you know him ? " " I would n't say we were close , but I worked with him , oh , probably five years or so . He never struck me as the sort who 'd commit suicide . Of course , you never know what someone under pressure will do . " " Pressure ? " " Lyda 'd threatened to leave him . Hugh was a sweet guy , but he was terribly dependent on her and I think it just knocked the props out from under him . " " Why was she leaving ? What was that about ? " " I was n't privy to the details . Lance might know . " Olive reappeared , white fur coat across her shoulders , the green dress over her arm . Terry and I abandoned the topic of Lyda Case . He made no comment when she gave me the dress . Maybe Olive always gave away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , confiningourselves to small talk . It was fully dark by then and the night was chilly . I turned on the heater in my car and drove to a pay phone in Montebello Village , putting a call in to Darcy at home . I wanted to stop off and see her before I went back to my place . But she told me Andy 'd worked late , so she had n't had a chance to search his office . She was going in early the next morning , and said she 'd call if she came up with anything . I hung up , realizing then how exhausted I felt . In addition to the jet lag , I was operating on a bad night 's sleep , and the fragmentary nap I 'd picked up this morning was n't helping anything . I headed home . As I turned the corner onto my street , I spotted Daniel 's rental car , still sitting at the curb in front of my apartment . I parked and got out . Even in the dark , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dash as they had been before . I was just opening the gate when he rolled down his window . " Can I talk to you ? " I felt something snappish rise up in me , but I forced it back down again . I do n't like being bitchy , and I hated admitting to myself that he still had the power to distress . " All right , " I said . I approached the car and halted about six feet away . " What is it ? " He unfolded himself and emerged from the car , leaning his elbowsp95on the open car door . The pale glow from the street light gilded his cheekbones , touching off strands of silver in the cloud of blond hair . " I 'm in a bit of a bind , " he said . His face was dappled with shadows that masked the remembered clear blue of his eyes . After eight years , it was amazingly painful just to be in his company . I thought the safest course was to repeat information back to him without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . There was a brief silence wherein I assumed I was meant to quiz him on the nature of his problem . I clamped my teeth together , waiting patiently . He smiled ruefully . " Do n't worry . I 'm not going to ask you for money and I 'm not trying to get in your pants . " " This comes as a big relief , Daniel . What do you want ? " The bitchy tone was already back , but I swear I could n't help myself . There 's nothing more infuriating than a man who 's manipulated your emotionsonce and now thinks he can do it again . I could still remember the charge that ran between us early in our relationship , sexual electricityinfusing the very air we breathed . It had taken years for me to realize that I had generated most of it myself out of my own neediness . Maybe that 's what was making me so churlish in retrospect . I was still chafing at myself for what a fool I 'd been . " I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What gear ? " He shrugged . " I got a two-thousand-dollar acoustic guitar I ca n't leave because the trunk lock is busted on the rental car I picked up . It 'll get ripped off if it 's in the back seat . " " You brought a guitar like that all the way from Florida ? " " I thought maybe I 'd pick up a gig out here . I could use the bucks . " " What happened to your friend ? I thought you got a ride withsomeone . Why not take it to his place ? Or is it a woman ? I guess Inever asked you that . " " Well , no , it 's a guy , " he said . " The problem is , he does n't actually live here in town . He was just passing through on his way to San Francisco and he wo n't be back till late on Sunday . That 's why I had to rent a car of my own . " " Where are you staying ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that . The town 's booked solid because of the holidays . Meantime , I ca n't even pull into a gas station to take a leak without hauling everything in with me . It 's just for a couple of days . "  |p96I  stared at him . " You always do things like this , you know that ? You 're always in a bind , shifting your weight from foot to foot , hoping someone 'll bail you out of the hole you 're in . Try the Rescue Mission . Pick up a woman . That should n't be so tough . Or sell the damn thing . Why is it up to me ? " " It 's not up to you , " he said mildly . " It 's a simple favor . What 's the big deal ? " I ran out of steam . We 'd had this same exchange a hundred times and he 'd never heard me before . I might as well save my breath . I might as well give him what he wanted and get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prolong our contact . " Never mind , " I said . " No big deal . You can park the damn thing in a corner until Sunday and then I want it out of here . " " Sure . No problem . Thanks . " " I 'm warning you , Daniel . If you 've got a stash anywhere within six blocks of here , I 'll call the cops . " " I 'm clean . I told you that . You can look for yourself . " " Skip it , " I said . I knew him well enough to know he would n't bluff on that , because he knew me well enough to know I 'd have him thrown in the slammer if I caught him.  |p97I  took a couple of Tylenols and slept like a stone  --  deep , dreamless sleep that soothed my frazzled nerves and restored my good spirits . I was up at six , ready to jog as usual . There was no sign of Daniel parked at my curb . I did a perfunctory stretch against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run felt great . The sky was a pearl gray streaked with pink . To my right , a dark-gray surf boomed against the hard-packed sand , leavingsnowy froth in its wake . The wharf was mirrored in the glistening pools that remained when the waves receded . The sea seemed to shush the birds that shrieked overhead . This was the last day of the year and I ran with a sense of optimism the new year always brings . I 'd find a way to sort it all out : Lance , Mac 's suspicions about me , even Daniel 's sudden appearance on my doorstep . I was alive and healthy , physicallyfit . Rosie 's would open again on Monday . Henry would be home in another six days . I had the sassy green dress Olive had given me , and maybe a New Year 's invitation if she came through as hoped . I did my three miles and slowed to a walk , cooling off as I headed home . I showered and dressed in jeans as usual , savoring the morning at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone calls . I ate my cereal and read the L.A. Times over two cups of coffee . Daniel 's guitar sat in the corner in mute testimony to his renewed presence in my life , but I ignored it for the most part. t Darcy called at 7:35 from California Fidelity . She 's done a thorough search . Andy 's office was clean . " Shit , " I said . " What about a typewriter ? I was hoping we could get a match on the phony fire department report , but I did n't find one at his apartment . " " Maybe he keeps it in the trunk of his car . " " Oh , I like that . I 'll see if I can find a way to check that out . In the meantime , keep an eye peeled . Maybe something will surface . Andy'sp98gotta be tied into this business somehow . It would help a lot to know who he knows at Wood/Warren . Did you go through his Rolodex ? " " That wo n't help . He knows all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to have the number handy . I 'll check it out , though . Maybe something else will come to light . " She clicked off . At 8:00 , I put a call through to Lyda Case in Texas . Her roommate said she was out of town , maybe in California , but she was n't sure . I left my number and asked her to have Lyda get in touch with me if she called home . I called my pal at the credit bureau , but she was out until Monday . I had the feeling the rest of the day was going to come down about the same way . It was New Year 's Eve day . As with Christmas Eve , businesseswere closing early , people taking off at noon . Olive called me at 10:00 to say that she was indeed putting together an impromptu cocktailparty . " It 's mostly family and a few close friends . Half the people I called already had plans . Are you free ? We 'd love to have you , if you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " I said . " I 'd love to come . " I hated to sound so eager , but in truth I was . I did n't want to spend this New Year 's Eve alone . I was worried Daniel might start looking too good . " Can I bring anything ? " " Actually I could use some help , " she said . " I gave the housekeeper the weekend off , so I 'm throwing the whole thing together by myself . I can always use an extra set of hands . " " Well , I 'm not a cook , but I can sure chop and stir . What time ? " " Four-thirty ? I 'll be back from the supermarket by then . Ash said she 'd come about five to help , too . Everybody else will be coming about seven . We 'll keep going till the food and alcohol give out . " " Great , " I said . " And the green dress will be okay ? " " It better be . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I put a call through to Lance . I did n't like initiating the contact with him , but I had to hear his version of the situation with Hugh Case . As soon as he was on the line , I told him what I 'd heard . The silence was weighty . " Lance ? " " I 'm here , " he said . He sighed heavily . " Jesus , I do n't know how to deal with this shit . What the hell is going on ? I heard rumors back then she thought I had something to do with his death . It 's not true.  |p99It  's completely untrue , but I do n't have a way of proving it . Why would I do that ? What could I possibly gain by killing him ? " " Was n't he leaving the company ? " " Absolutely not . He talked about quitting . He said he wanted to start a company of his own . He even gave notice , but hell , I called him in and we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice-president . I gave him a big raise and he was happy as a clam . " " When was this ? " " I do n't know . A couple of days before he died . " " Did n't that strike you as peculiar ? " " Sure it did . She swore he did n't kill himself and I agreed . He was n't the depressive type and he 'd just made a hell of a deal for himself . Somehow she got it in her head that I killed the man . I would n't harm a soul . You got ta believe me . Somebody 's working very hard to get me put away . " " Speaking of which , have you heard anything from California Fi-delity ? " His tone changed . " Yeah , yesterday . They 're turning everything over to the cops . " I could feel my stomach clench . " Really ? Do they have enough to make a case ? " " I do n't know . I hope not . Look , I need to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's important . Is there any way we can meet ? " I told him I 'd be at Olive 's later and we agreed to talk then . I was n't anxious to be seen in his company , but he seemed insistent , and at that point , I did n't see how things could get worse . I was n't guilty of conspiracy and I was tired of acting like I was . Worry was sitting on my chest like a weight , leaden and oppressive . I had to do something to get my mind off things . I went out and bought a pair of high heels , anxiety translating into excitement as the day progressed . Being isolated that week had made me aware that I do have a few social impulses  --  buried deep , perhaps , under layers of caution , but part of me nevertheless . This was like dress-up time with the big kids , and I was looking forward to it . I 'd begun to feel very charitable about Olive , whose life-style only yesterdayhad seemed superficial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of my business how she made her peace with the world . She 'd fashioned a life out of tennis and shopping , but she managed top100do occasional charity work , which was more than I could claim . She was right about one thing : the harm in the world is done by those who feel disenfranchised and abused . Contented people ( as a rule ) do n't kite checks , rob banks , or kill their fellow citizens . I thought about going to the gym , but decided to bag that idea . I had n't done a workout since Tuesday , but I just did n't give a damn . I puttered and napped through the middle of the day . At 3:00 I took a long bubble bath . . . well , I used dishwashing liquid , but it did foam right up . I washed my hair and combed it for a change . I did some stuff to my face that passed for makeup in my book , and then wiggled into underwear and panty hose . The dress was grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way Olive 's had the night before . I 'd never had a role model for this female stuff . After my parents ' death when I was five , I 'd been raised by a maiden aunt , no expert herself at things feminine . I 'd spent the days of my childhood with cap guns and books , learning self-sufficiency , which loomed large with her . By the time I reached junior high I was a complete misfit , and by high school I 'd thrown in my lot with some bad-ass boys who cussed and smoked dope , two things I mastered at an early age . In spite of the fact that I 'm a social oaf , my aunt instilled a solid set of values , which prevailed in the end . By the time I graduated , I 'd straightened up my act and now I 'm a model citizen , give or take a civil code or two . At heart , I 've always been a prissy little moralist . Private investigation is just my way of acting out . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening to the door chime echo through the house . It did n't look as if anyone was there . There was mail jammed in the box , the newspaper and a brown paper-wrapped parcel on the mat . I peered into one of the long glass panels on either side of the front door . The foyer was dark and no lights were showing at the rear of the house . Olive probably was n't home from the supermarket yet . The cat appeared from around the side of the house with her long white coat and flat face . Somehow she seemed like a girl to me , but what do I know ? I said some cat-type things . She appeared unimpressed . I heard a car horn toot . The electronic gate was rolled back from the driveway and a white Mercedes 380 SL pulled in . Olive waved and I moved toward the parking pad . She got out of the car and moved around to the rear , looking very classy in her white fur coat.  | " Sorry I 'm late . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She opened the trunk and picked up one grocery bag , then struggled to lift a second . " Here , let me help with that . " " Oh , thanks . Terry should be right behind me with the liquor . " I took the bag , snagging up another one while I was at it . There were two more in the trunk and another two bags visible in the front seat . " God , how many people did you invite ? " " Just forty or so . It should be fun . Let 's get these in and we 'll have Terry bring the rest . We 've got a ton of work to do . " She moved toward the front door while I brought up the rear . There was a crunch of tires on gravel and Terry pulled into the drive in a silver-gray Mercedes sedan . Must be nice , I thought . The gate rolled shut . I waited while Olive emptied the mailbox and shoved the stack of envelopes in the top of her grocery bag . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then grabbed the parcel . " You need help ? I can take something else . " " I got it . " She laid the parcel across the bag , securing it with her chin while she fumbled for her house key . The cat was sauntering toward the driveway , plumed tail aloft . I heard the clink of liquor bottles as Terry set his bags down on the concrete . He began to coil up a garden hose the yardman had left on the walk . " Break your neck on this thing , " he said . Olive got the door open and gave it a push . The telephone started to ring . I glanced back as she tossed the parcel toward the hall table . What happened next was too swift to absorb . There was a flash of light , a great sunburst that filled my visual field like a sun , followed by a huge cloud of white smoke . Shrapnel shot from a central point , spraying outward with a deadly velocity . A fireball seemed to curl across the threshold like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the grass . Every blade of green in its path turned black . At the same time , I was lifted by a shattering low-frequency boom that hurtled me capriciously across the yard . I found myself sitting upright against a tree trunk like a rag doll , shoes gone , toes pointing straight up . I saw Olive fly past me as if she 'd been yanked , tumbling in a high comic arc that carried her to the hedge and dropped her in a heap . Myp102vision shimmered and cleared , a light show of the retina , accompanied by the breathless thumping of my heart . My brain , mute with wonder , failed to compute anything but the smell of black powder , pungent and harsh . The explosion had deafened me , but I felt neither fear nor surprise . Emotions are dependent on comprehension , and while I registered the event , nothing made any sense . Had I died in that moment , I would not have felt the slightest shred of regret , and I understood how liberatingsudden death must be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of the house was gone and a crater appeared where the hall table had been . The foyer was open to the air , surrounded by coronas of charred wood and plaster , burning merrily . Large flakes of pale blue and pale brown floated down like snow . Grocery items litteredthe entire yard , smelling of pickles , cocktail onions , and Scotch . I had taken in both sight and sound , but the apparatus of evaluation had n't caught up with me yet . I had no idea what had happened . I could n't remember what had transpired only moments before , or how this might relate to past events . Here we were in this new configuration , but how had it come to pass ? From the change in light , I guessed that my eyebrows and lashes must be gone and I was conscious of singed hair and flash burns . I put a hand up , amazed to find my limbs still functioning . I was bleeding from the nose , bleeding from both ears , where the pain was now excruciating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth working , but no words were coming out . Something had struck him a glancing blow and blood poured down his face . He appeared to be in pain , but the movie was silent , sound reel flapping ineffectually . I turned to see where Olive was . For one confused moment , I thought I saw a pile of tornfoxes , their bloodied pelts confirming what she 'd said the day before . It is true , I thought , these animals in the wild get ripped to shreds every day . The harsh splattering of red against the soft white fur seemed obscene and out of place . And then , of course , I understood what I was looking at . The blast had opened her body , exposing tangles of bloody flesh , yellowfat , and jagged bone along her backside . I closed my eyes . By then , the smell of black powder was overlaid with the scent of wood/smoke and cooked flesh . Carefully I pondered the current state of affairs . Olive had to be dead , but Terry seemed okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and help me up . No hurry , I thought . I 'm comfy for now . The tree trunk provided back support , which helped , as I was tired . Idly , I wondered where my shoes had gone . I sensed movement , and when I opened my eyes again , confused faces were peering into mine . I could n't think what to say . I 'd already forgottenwhat was going on , except that I was cold . Time must have passed . Men in yellow slickers pointed hoses at the house , swords of water cutting through the flames . Worried people crouched in front of me and worked their mouths some more . It was funny . They did n't seem to realize they were n't saying anything . So solemn , so animated , and so intent . Lips and teeth moving to such purpose with no visible effect . And then I was on my back , looking up into tree branches that wobbled through my visual field as I was borne away . I closed my eyes again , wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sick . In spite of the fire , I was shivering.  |p104Gradually  my hearing returned , pale voices in the distance coming nearer until I understood that it was someone bending over me . Daniel , as radiant as an archangel , appeared above me . The sight of him was baffling , and I felt an incredible urge to put a hand to my forehead , like a movie heroine recovering from a swoon , murmuring , Where am I ? I was probably dead . Surely , hell is having your former spouse that close again . . . flirting with a nurse . Ah , I thought , a clue . I was in a hospital bed . She was standing to his right , in polyester white , a vestal virgin with a bedpan , her gaze fixed on his perfect features in profile . I 'd forgotten how cunning he was at that sort of thing . While he feigned grave concern for me , he was actually casting backward with his little sexual net , enveloping her in a fine web of pheromones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I think she 's conscious . " " I 'll get the doctor , " the nurse said . She disappeared . Daniel stroked my hair . " What is it , babe ? Are you in pain ? " I licked my lips . " Asshole , " I said , but it came out all garbled and I was n't sure he got the drift . I vowed , in that moment , to get well enough to throw him out . I closed my eyes . I remembered the flash , the deafening bang , Olive flying past me like a mannequin . She had looked unreal , arms crooked , legs askew , as lumpen as a sandbag flung through the air , landing with a sodden thump . Olive must be dead . There was n't any way to mend the parts of her turned inside out by the blast . I remember Terry with the blood gushing down his face . Was he dead , too ? I looked at Daniel , wondering how bad it was . Daniel sensed my question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay . You 're in the hospital and Terry 's here , too , " he said . And after a hesitation , " Olive did n't make it . " I closed my eyes again , hoping he 'd go away.  |p105I  concentrated on my various body parts , hoping that all of them could be accounted for . Many treasured portions of my anatomy hurt . I thought at first I was in some sort of bed restraint , but it turned out to be an immobilizing combination of bruises , whiplash , IV fluids , painkillers , and pressure dressings on the areas where I had suffered burns . Given the fact that I 'd been standing ten feet away from Olive , my injuries turned out to be miraculously **25;15994;TOOLONG and abrasions , mild concussion , superficial burns on my extremities . I 'd been hospitalized primarily for shock . I was still confused about what had happened , but it did n't take a 160 IQ to figure out that something had gone boom in a big way . A gas explosion . More likely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low explosives . I know now , because I looked it up , that low explosives have velocities of 3,300 feet per second , which is much faster than the average person tends to move . That short trip from Olive 's front porch to the tree base was as close to free flight as I was ever going to get . The doctor came in . She was a plain woman with a good face and sense enough to ask Daniel to leave the room while she examined me . I liked her because she did n't lapse into a slack jawed stupor at the sight of him . I watched her , feeling as trusting as a child while she checked my vital signs . She must have been in her late thirties , with haphazard hair , no makeup , gray eyes that poured out compassion and intelligence . She held my hand , lacing her cool fingers through mine . " How are you feeling ? " Tears welled up . I saw my mother 's face superimposed on hers , and I was four again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was like to experience the warmth radiated by those who tend the sick . I was saturated by a tenderness I had n't felt since my mother died . I do n't take well to helplessness . I 've worked hard in my life to deny neediness , and there I was , unable to sustain any pretense of toughness or competence . In some ways it came as a great relief to lie there in a puddle and give myself up to her nurturing . By the time she 'd finished checking me , I was somewhat more alert , anxious to get my bearings . I quizzed her in a foggy way , trying to get a fix on my current state . She told me I was in a private room at St. Terry 's , having been admitted , through Emergency , the night before . I remembered , inp106fragments , some of it : the high keening of sirens as the ambulance swayed around corners , the harsh white light above me in the emergencyroom , the murmurs of the medical personnel assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was finally tucked into bed : clean , patched up , pumped full of medications , and feeling no pain . It was now mid-morning of New Year 's Day . I was still groggy , and I discovered belatedly that I was dropping off to sleep without even being aware of it . The next time I woke , the IV had been removed and the doctor had been replaced by a nurse 's aide who helped me onto the bedpan , cleaned me up again , changed my gown , and put fresh sheets on the bed , cranking me into a sitting position so I could see the world . It was nearly noon . I was famished by then and wolfed down a dish of cherry Jell-O the aide rustled up from somewhere . That held me until the meal carts arrived on the floor . Daniel had gone down to the hospital cafeteria for lunch , and by the time he got back , I 'd requested a " No Visitors " sign hung on the door . The restrictions must not have applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , he was sitting in the chair , leafing through a magazine . He 's in his fifties , a big , shambling man , with scuffed shoes and a lightweight beige suit . He looked exhausted from the horizontal lines across his forehead to his sagging jawline , which was ill-shaved . His thinning hair was rumpled . He had bags under his eyes and his color was bad . I had to guess that he 'd been out late the night before , maybe looking forward to a day of football games on TV instead of interviewing me . He looked up from his magazine and saw that I was awake . I 've known Dolan for maybe five years , and while we respect each other , we 're never at ease . He 's in charge of the homicide detail of the Santa Teresa Police Department , and we sometimes cross swords . He 's not fond of private investigators and I 'm not fond of having to defend my occupational status . If I could find a way to avoid homicide cases , believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " More or less . " He set the magazine aside and got up , shoving his hands in his coat pockets while he stood by my bed . All my usual sassiness had been , quite literally , blown away . Lieutenant Dolan did n't seem to knowp107how to handle me in my subdued state . " You feel well enough to talk about last night ? " " I think so . " " You remember what happened ? " " Some . There was an explosion and Olive was killed . " Dolan 's mouth pulled down . " Died instantly . Her husband survived , but he 's blanking on things . Doctor says it 'll come back to him in a day or two . You got off light for someone standing right in the path . " " Bomb ? " " Package bomb . Black powder , we think . I have the bomb techs on it now , cataloguing evidence . What about the parcel ? You see any-thing ? " " There was a package on the doorstep when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Four-thirty . Little bit before . The Kohlers were having a New Year 's Eve party and she asked me to help . " I filled him in briefly on the circumstances of the party . I could feel myself reviving , my thoughts gradually becoming more coherent . " Tell me what you remember about the parcel . " " There is n't much . I only glanced at it once . Brown paper . No string . Block lettering , done with a Magic Marker from the look of it . I saw it upside down . " " The address facing the door , " he said . He took out a little spiralboundnotebook and a pen . " Right . " " Who 's it sent to ? " " Terry , I think . Not Mr. and Mrs. ' because the line of print was n't that long . Even upside down , I 'd have noticed the O ' in Olive 's name . " He was jotting notes . " Return address ? " " Uhn  --  un . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPS number , but I did n't see one . " " You 're doing pretty good , " he said . " The regular mailman says he only delivered hand mail yesterday , no packages at all . UPS had no record of a delivery to that address . They did n't even have a truck in the area . You did n't see anyone leave the premises ? " I tried to think back , but I was drawing a blank . " Ca n't help youp108there . I do n't remember anyone on foot . A car might have passed , but I ca n't picture it . " I closed my eyes , visualizing the porch . There were salmon begonias in big tubs along the front . " Oh , yeah . The newspaper was on the doormat . I do n't know how far up the walk the paperboy comes , but he might have seen the parcel when he was doing his route . " He made another note . " We 'll try that . What about dimensions ? " I could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bigger than a book . Nine by twelve inches by three . Was there anything left of it ? " " More than you 'd think . We believe there was gift wrap under the brown mailing paper . Blue . " " Oh sure , " I said , startled . " I remember seeing flakes of brown and blue . I thought it was snow , but it must have been paper particles . " I remembered what Terry had said to me . " Oh . Something else , " I said . " Terry was threatened . He talked about it when I was there the night before . He had a phone call at the plant from a woman named Lyda Case . She asked him when his birthday was and when he told her , she said he should n't count on it . " I filled him in on the rest , unburdening the sequence of events from the first . For once , I loved offloading the information on him . This was big time . . . the heavy hitters . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it came down to bombs , I was out of my league . LieutenantDolan was scratching notes at a quick clip , his expression that mask of studied neutrality all cops tend to wear  --  taking in everything , giving nothing back . He talked as if he was already on the witness stand . " So there 's a chance she 's in Santa Teresa . Is that what you 're saying ? " " I do n't know . He seemed to think she was coming out , but he was pretty vague on that point . He 's here , too ? " I asked . " This floor . Other end of the hall . " " You care if I talk to him ? " " No , not a bit . Might help jog his memory . " After Lieutenant Dolan left , I eased into a sitting position on the edge of the bed , feet dangling over the side . My head was pounding at the sudden exertion . I sat and waited for the light show inside my head to fade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see . My legs looked frail under the lightweight cotton of the hospital gown , which tied at the back and let in lots of air . The pattern ofp109bruises across my front looked like someone had taken a powder puff and dusted me with purple talc . My hands were bandaged and I could see an aura of angry red flesh along my inner arms where the burns tapered off . I held onto the handrail and slid off the bed , supporting myself on the bed table . My legs were trembling . I could almost bet they did n't want me getting up this way . I did n't think it was such a hot idea myself , the more I thought of it . Nausea and clamminess were chiming in with the pounding in my head and a fuzzy darkness was gathering along the periphery of my vision . I was n't going to win an award for this so I sat back down . There was a tap at the door and the nurse came in . " Your husband 's out here . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you before he goes . " " He 's not my husband , " I said automatically . She put her hands in the pockets of her uniform  --  a tunic over white pants , no cap . I only knew she was a nurse because her plastic name tag had an R.N. after her name , which was Sharie Wright . I studied her covertly , knowing how much Daniel liked women with names like that . Debbie and Tammie and Cindie . Candie loomed large in there , too . I guess Kinsey qualified , now that I thought of it . Kinsie . Infidelityreduces and diminishes , leaving nothing where you once had a sense of self-worth . " He 's been worried sick , " she said . " I know it 's none of my business , but he was here all night . I thought you should be aware . " She saw that I was struggling to get settled in the bed and she gave me a hand . I guessed that she was twenty-six . I was twenty-three when I married him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . The divorce was no-fault , served up in record time . " Is there a way I can get a wheelchair ? There 's someone down the hall I 'd like to see . The man who was admitted at the same time I was . " " Mr. Kohler . He 's in three oh six at the end of the hall . " " How 's he doing ? " " Fine . He 's going home this afternoon . " " The policeman who was here a little while ago wants me to talk to him . " " What about your husband ? He said it would only take two min-utes. "  | " He 's not my husband , " I said , parrotlike , " but sure . Send him in . After he goes , could you find me a wheelchair ? If I try to walk , I 'll fall on my puss and have to sue this outfit . " She did n't think I was amusing and she did n't like the reference to lawsuits . She went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should live so long.  |p111He  looked tired , an improvement , I thought . Daniel stood by my hospital bed , showing every minute of his forty-two years . " I know this wo n't sit well with you , " he said , " but the doctor says she wo n't let you go home unless you have someone to look after you . " A feeling very like panic crept up in my chest . " I 'll be fine in a day . I do n't need anyone looking after me . I hate that idea . " " Well , I knew you would . I 'm telling you what she said . " " She did n't mention it to me . " " She never had a chance . You were half zonked . She said she 'd talk to you about it next time she made her rounds . " " They ca n't keep me here . That 's disgusting . I 'll go nuts . " " I already told her that . I just wanted you to know I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here and settled at home . I would n't actually have to stay on the premises . That place of yours looks too small for more than one person anyway . But I could at least check on you twice a day , make sure you have everything you need . " " Let me think about it , " I said grudgingly . But I could already see the bind I was in . With Henry gone , Rosie on vacation , and Jonah out of town , I 'd be on my own . Truly , I was n't feeling that good . I just could n't make my body do what I wanted it to . The elderly , the feeble , and the infirm must experience the same exasperation and bewilderment . For once , my determination had nothing whatever to do with my proficiency . It was exhausting to sit up , and I knew perfectly well I could n't manage much at home . Staying here was out of the question . Hospitals are dangerous . People make mistakes . Wrong blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was checking out of this place " toot sweet . " Daniel ran his hand across the top of my head . " Do what you want . I 'll be back later . " He was gone again before I could protest . I buzzed the nurses ' station on the intercom.  |p112A  hollow voice came on . " Yes ? " " Can Mr. Kohler in three-oh-six have visitors ? " " As far as I know he can . " The nurse sounded like she was talking into an old tin can , coughs and rustling in the background . " Can I get a wheelchair ? I 'd like to go down and see him . " It was twenty minutes before anybody managed to find me one . In the meantime , I became aware that I was struggling with a depression generated by Olive 's death . It was n't as if we had had a relationship , but she 'd been around on the borders of my life for years . I 'd first seen her in high school when I met Ashley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that she was more rumor than fact . . . the sister who was always off somewhere else : boarding school , Switzerland , skiing in Utah with friends . I do n't think we 'd exchanged more than superficial chat until two days before , and then I 'd found my opinion of her undergoing a shift . Now , death had smashed her like a bug , the blow as abrupt as a fly being swatted on a windowsill . The effect was jarring and the emotional impact had n't worn off . I found myself turning images in my mind , trying to absorb the finality . I had n't been consulted in the matter and I had n't agreed . Death is insulting , and I resented its sudden appearance , like an unannounced visit from a boorish relative . I suspected the knot in my chest would be there for a long time ; not grief per se , but a hard fist of regret . I wheeled myself down the corridor to room 306 . The door was closed and Bass was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I approached . Bass had the smooth good looks of someone in an eighteenth-centuryoil painting . His face was oval , boyish , his brow unlined , his eyes a barren brown . His mouth was sensual , his manner superior . Put him in a satin vest , a waistcoat , breeches , and leggings , and he might have been Blue Boy , grown slightly decadent . His hair was fine and dark , receding at the temples , worn slightly long and rather wispy where it gathered in a point on his forehead . He should have had an Afghan at his side , some creature with silky ears and a long , aristocratic snout . " Hello , Bass . I 'm Kinsey Millhone . Do you remember me ? " " Of course , " he said . He bent down then and gave my cheek a social buss , more noise than contact . His expression was bleak . There was a dead time in the air , one of those uncomfortable stretched moments when you struggle to find something to say . His sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was puzzled by the awkwardnessof our encounter . " Where 's Terry ? " He glanced at the door . " He 's having his dressing changed . They should be done shortly . " He 's going home as soon as the doctor signs the release . How are you ? We heard you were down the hall . " " I 'm all right . I 'm sorry about Olive , " I said , and I truly was . " God , this is all so screwed up . I do n't know what 's going on . " " How 's your mother doing ? Is she holding up all right ? " " She 'll be okay . She 's a tough old bird . She 's taking it pretty hard , but she 's got a spine of steel . Ash is destroyed . She 's been leveled . She and Olive were always just like this , " he said , holding up crossed fingers . " What about you ? You look like you took a beating . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been out of bed and I feel like shit . " " You 're lucky to be alive from what I hear . " " Luck is right . I thought about picking the package up myself , but Olive 's car pulled in and I went to help her with the groceries instead . Are you staying at your mother 's ? " He nodded . " I got in Thursday night and then Olive called yesterdayand said she was putting the party together . Seems like years ago . I was having a swim before I got dressed when Ebony showed up at the side of the pool . I could n't figure out what was wrong with her . You know Eb . Always in control , never a hair out of place . Well , she looked like a wild woman . I pulled myself up on the side of the pool and she said a bomb had gone off at Olive 's house and she was dead . I thought she was making the whole thing up . I laughed . It was so farfetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit out of me and that 's when I realized she was serious . What happened ? Terry ca n't remember and the police wo n't tell us much . " I told him what I could , omitting the gruesome details of Olive 's injuries . Even talking about it made me shake . I clamped my teeth shut , trying to relax . " Sorry , " I said . " It 's my fault . I should n't have brought it up , " he said . " I did n't mean to put you through it all again . " I shook my head . " That 's fine . I 'm okay . Nobody 's told me much either . Honestly , I think it helps . The blanks are frustrating . " I wasp114looking for a narrative thread to hang fragments on . I 'd lost the night . Everything from 4:30 on had been deleted from my memory bank . He hesitated for a moment and then filled me in on events from his end . Ash had left . She was on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . As soon as he heard about the explosion , he pulled some clothes on and he and Ebony jumped in the car . They arrived to find Terry being loaded into the ambulance . I was being bundled onto a stretcher , semiconscious . Olive was still lying near the shrubs , covered by a blanket . Bass 's recital of events was flat , like a news report . He was calm , his tone impersonal . He made no eye contact . I stared down the hall where a doctor with a somber expression was talking to an older couple sitting on a bench . The news must have been bad because the woman clutched and unclutched the purse in her lap . I remembered then that I had seen Bass . . . one of the faces scrutinizingmine , bobbing above me like a balloon on a string . By then , shock had set in and I was shivering uncontrollably , in spite of the blankets they 'd wrapped me in . I did n't remember Ebony . Maybe they had kept her out by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carnage . The bomb had made tatters of Olive 's flesh . Hunks of her body had been blown against the hedges , like clots of snow . I put a hand against my face , feeling flushed with tears . Bass patted me awkwardly , murmuring nonsense , upset that he 'd upset me , probablywondering how to get out of it . The emotion passed and I collected myself , taking a deep breath . " What about Terry 's injuries ? " " Not bad . A cut on his forehead . Couple of cracked ribs where the blast knocked him into the garage . They wanted him in for observation , but he seems okay . " There was activity behind us and the door to Terry 's room opened . A nurse came out bearing a stainless steel bowl full of soiled bandages . She seemed enveloped in aromas of denatured alcohol , tincture of iodine , and the distinctive smell of adhesive tape . " You can go in now . Doctor said he can leave any time . We 'll get a wheelchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bass went in first . I wheeled myself in behind . A nurse 's aide was straightening the bed table where the nurse had been working . Terry was sitting on the edge of the bed , buttoning up his shirt . I caught sight of his taped ribs through the loose flaps of his shirt and I lookedp115away . His torso was stark white and hairless , his chest narrow and without musculature . Illness and injury seem so personal . I did n't want to know the details of his frailty . He looked battered , with a dark track sketched along his forehead where the stitches had been put in . One wrist was bandaged , from cuts perhaps , or bums . His face was pale , his moustache stark , his dark hair disheveled . He seemed shrunken , as if Olive 's death had diminishedhim . Ebony appeared in the doorway , taking in the scene with a cursory glance . She hesitated , waiting for the aide to finish . The room seemed unbearably crowded . I needed fresh air . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wheeled myself out . Ebony followed me as far as the visitor 's lounge , a small alcove with a green tweed couch , two matching chairs , an artificial palm and an ashtray . She took a seat , searching through her handbag for her cigarettes . She lit one , sucking in smoke as if it was oxygen . She looked totally composed , but it was clear that the hospital atmosphere unsettledher . She picked a piece of lint from the lap of her skirt . " I do n't understand any of this , " she said harshly . " Who 'd want to kill Olive ? She never did anything . " " Olive was n't the target . It was Terry . The package with the bomb in it was addressed to him . " Ebony 's gaze shot up to mine and hung there . A pale wash of pink appeared in the dead white of her face . The hand with the cigarette gave a lurch , almost of its own accord , and cigarette ash tumbled into her lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ridiculous , " she snapped . " The police said there was nothing left of the package once the bomb went off . " She stubbed the cigarette out . " Well , there was , " I said . " Besides which , I saw it . Terry 's name was printed on the front , not hers . " " I do n't believe it . " A wisp of smoke drifted up from the crushed cigarette stub . She snatched it up again , working the live ember out with her fingertips . She was shredding the remains of the cigarette . The strands of raw tobacco seemed obscene . " I 'm just telling you what I saw . Olive could have been the target , but the package was addressed to him . " " Bullshit ! That bastard ! Do n't tell me Olive died because she pickedp116it up instead of him ! " Her eyes suffused with tears and she struggled for control . She got up , pacing with agitation . I turned the wheelchair slightly , tracking her course . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She sat down abruptly , pressing the butts of both palms against her eyes . " No one . I 'm sorry . I had no idea . I thought someone meant to kill her , which was horrible enough . But to die by mistake . My God ! At least she did n't suffer . They swear she died instantly . " She sobbed once . She formed a tent of her hands , breathing hard into her palms . " Do you know who killed her ? " " Of course not ! Absolutely not ! What kind of monster do you think I am ? My own sister . . . " Her tone of outrage fell away and she wept earnestly . I wanted to believe her , but I could n't be sure . I was tired , too close to events to sort out the false from the true . She lifted her face , which was washed with tears . " Olive said she was n't going to vote with you , " I said , trying the possibility on her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shrieked at me . " How dare you ! Get away from me ! " Bass appeared in the archway , his gaze turning to mine quizzically . I jammed backward on the push rim , pivoting in the wheelchair . I pushed myself down the corridor , passing a room where someone was calling for help in a low , hopeless tone . A clear plastic tube trailed from under the sheet to a gallon jug of urine under the bed . It looked like lemonade . Olive usually brought the mail in . I 'd seen her toss it on the hall table carelessly the day before . She might have been the intended victim even if the package was addressed to him . I really could n't remember what she 'd told me about who she was siding with in the power play between Ebony and Lance . Maybe he did it as a means of persuading the others to fall in line . Darcy was waiting in my room when I got back . " Andy 's gone , " she said.  |p117I  eased myself back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andy had come whipping into the office at about 10:00 the day before . Mac had insisted on keeping office hours until five , despite the fact that it was New Year 's Eve day . Andy had a lunch meeting scheduled as well as a 2:00 appointment with one of the company vice-presidents . Darcy said Andy was in panic mode . She tried to give him his phone messages , but he cut her dead , hurried into his office , and began to load his personal items into his briefcase , along with his Rolodex . Next thing she knew , he was gone . " It was too weird for words , " she said . " He 's never done anything like that before . And why the Rolodex ? I 'd already been through it and I did n't find a thing , but what made him think of that ? " " Maybe he 's psychic . " " He 'd have to be . Anyway , we did n't see him again for the rest of the day , so after work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " " You went all the way out to Elton ? " " Well , yeah . I just did n't like his attitude . He really had his undies in a bundle and I wanted to know what it was about . I did n't see his car parked anywhere near his apartment , so I went up and peeked in his front window . The place was a pigsty and all the furniture was gone . Maybe a card table in the living room , but that was it . " " That 's all he 's got , " I said . " It looks like Janice took him for a bundle and she 's clamoring for more . " " She can clamor all she wants , Kinsey , the man is gone . His nextdoorneighbor saw me peering in the window and he came out and asked me what I was up to . I told him the truth . I said I worked with Andy and we were worried because he left the office in a snit without telling us what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down the steps yesterday morning with two big suitcases banging against his legs . This was maybe nine-thirty , something like that . He must have come straight to the office , packed up his stuff , andp118taken off . I called his place every couple of hours last night and again this morning . All I get is his machine . " I thought about it briefly . " Did the newspapers carry an account of Olive 's death ? " " Not till this morning and he was gone by then . " I could feel a surge of energy , part restlessness , part dread . I pushed the covers back and swung my legs over the side of the bed . " I 've got ta get out of here . " " Are you supposed to be up ? " " Sure . No problem . Check the closet and see if Daniel brought me any clothes . " The green cocktail dress was gone , probably dissected by a pair of surgical scissors in the emergency room the night before , along with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " she said . She held up my handbag . " Great . We 're in business . As long as I 've got my keys , I can getsome clothes when I get home . I assume you 've got a car here . " " Can you leave without a doctor 's permission ? " " I got it . She told Daniel I could go as long as he looked in on me , which he said he would . " Darcy studied me uncertainly , probably guessing what I said was part fib . " God , do n't worry about it , Darcy . It 's not against the law to check out of a hospital . It 's not a prison sentence . I 'm a volunteer , " I said . " What about your bill ? " " Would you quit being such a stickler ? My insurance pays for this so I do n't owe them anything . They 've got my address . They 'll find me if they need to . " Darcy was clearly unconvinced , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down the corridor toward the elevators . One of the nurse 's aides stared at us as we went by , but I gave her a little wave and she apparently decided she did n't need to concern herself . When we got downstairs , Darcy lent me her coat and left me in the glass foyer while she went to fetch the car . There I sat in my borrowed coat and little paper slippers , handbag in my lap . If my doctor walked by , I was n't sure what I 'd do . People passing through the foyer gave me cursory glances , but nobody said a word . Being sick is bullshit . I had work to do.  |p119By  3:15 I was letting myself into my apartment , which already seemed to have the musty smell of neglect . I 'd been gone one day , but it felt like weeks . Darcy came in behind me , her expression tinged with guilt when she saw that I was still shaky on my feet . I perched on the couch , momentarily clammy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . I was easing into my blue jeans . " Let 's go into the office and see if Andy left anything behind , " I said . I pulled on a sweatshirt and went into the bathroom , where I brushed my teeth . My reflection in the bathroom mirror showed a face marked by astonishment where my eyebrows used to be . My cheeks looked sunburned . I could see a few scrapes and bruises , but it was no big deal . I kind of liked having frizz across the front where my hair once was . I opened the medicine cabinetand took out my trusty nail scissors . I clipped the tape off my right arm and unwound the gauze , inspecting what was underneath . Looked okay to me . Burns do better in the open air , anyway . I took a painkiller just in case , and then waved dismissively at the sight of myself . I was fine . I snagged the file folder I 'd made after raiding Andy 's trash . I put on some sweatsocks and tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Santa Teresa usually gets chilly once the sun goes down and I was n't sure how long I 'd be gone . Outside , it felt more like August than January . The sky was clear , the sun high overhead . There was no breeze at all , and the sidewalks were functioning like solar panels , absorbing the sunlight , throwing off heat . There was no sign of Daniel , for which I was grateful . He would no doubt have disapproved of my hospital defection . I spotted my little VW parked two doors down and I was glad somebody 'd had the foresight to drive it back to my place . I was n't up to driving yet , but it was nice to know the car was there . Darcy drove us over to the office . There was scarcely any traffic . The whole downtown area seemed deserted , as if in the wake of nuclearattack . The parking lot was empty , except for a series of beer bottles clustered near the kiosk , the dregs of a New Year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know what bothers me ? " I asked Darcy as we climbed . She unlocked the door to the building , glancing back at me . " What 's that ? "  | " Well , suppose we assume Andy 's guilty of conspiracy in this . It does look that way even though we do n't have proof at this point , right ? " " I 'd say so . " " I ca n't figure out why he agreed to it . We 're talking major insurancefraud . He gets caught , it 's his livelihood . So what 's in it for him ? " " It has to be a payoff , " Darcy said . " If Janice hosed him , he 's probably desperate for cash . " " Maybe , " I said . " It means somebody knew him well enough to think he 'd tumble to a bribe . Andy 's always been a jerk , but I never really thought of him as dishonest . " We 'd reached the glass doors of California Fidelity . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and let us in . She flipped the overhead lights on and tossed her handbag on a chair . " I do n't really know . I 'm wondering if something else was going on , I guess . He 's in a perfect position to fiddle with the claim forms , but it 's still a big risk . And why the panic ? What went wrong ? " " He probably did n't count on Olive getting killed . That 's got ta fit in somewhere , " she said . We went into Andy 's office . Darcy watched with interest as I went through a systematic search . It looked like his business files were still intact , but all of his personal effects had been removed ; the photograph of his kids that had sat on his desk , his leather-bound appointmentcalendar , address book , Rolodex , even the framed APSCRAP and MDRT awards he 'd gotten some years before . He 'd left a studio portrait of Janice , a five-by-seven color head shot , showing bouffant blond hair , a heart-shaped face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiteful look about her , even grinning at the camera . Andy had blackenedone front tooth and penned in some handsome hairs growing out of her nose . By widening her nostrils slightly , he 'd created a piggy effect . The ever-mature Andy Motycka expressing his opinion of his ex-wife . I sat in his swivel chair and surveyed the place , wondering how I was going to get a line on him . Where would he go and why take off like that ? Had he made the bomb ? Darcy was quiet , not wanting to interrupt my thought processes , such as they were . " You have a number for Janice ? " I asked  | " Yeah , at my desk . You want me to call and see if she knows where he is ? " " Let 's do that . Make up an excuse if you can , and do n't give anythingaway . If she does n't know he 's skipped out , let 's do n't tip it at this point . " " Right , " Darcy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the file I 'd brought and pulled out all the papers . It was clear that Andy was in serious financial straits . Between Janice 's harangue over the late support check , and the pink- and red-rimmed dunning notices , it was safe to assume that the pressure was on . I reread the various versions of his love letter to his inamorata . That must have been quite a Christmas eve they 'd had . Maybe he 'd run away with her . Andy 's calendar pad still sat at the uppermost edge of his blotter , two date sheets side by side , connected by arched clips that allowed the pages to lie flat . He 'd taken his leather month-by-month appointmentbook , but he 'd left this behind . Apparently he made a habit of noting appointments on both places so his secretary could keep track of his whereabouts . I leafed back through the week , day by day . On Friday , December 24 , he 'd circled 9:00 P.M. and penciled in the initial L. Was this his beloved ? I worked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cropped up at irregular intervals , with no pattern that I could discern . I went out to the reception area , taking the calendar pad and the file folder with me . Darcy was on the phone , in the midst of a chat with Janice , from what I gathered . " Uh  --  hun . Well , I would n't know anything about that . I do n't know him all that well . Uh  --  hun . What 's your attorney telling you ? I guess that 's true , but I do n't know what good it would do you . Look , I 'm going to have to run , Janice . I 've got somebody standing here waiting to use the phone . Uh  --  hun , I 'd appreciate that and I 'll let you know what we hear on this end . I 'm sure he just went off for the weekend and forgot to mention it . Thanks much . You too . Bye-bye . Right . " Darcy replaced the receiver and let out a deep breath . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called when I did because I got an earful . She 's p.o. ' d . He was supposed to come by last night and pick the kids up and he never showed . She was all set to go out and had top122cancel her plans . No call , no apologies , nothing . She 's convinced he 's skipped town and she 's all set to call the cops . " " Would n't do any good unless he 's been missing seventy-two hours , " I said . " He 's probably shacked up somewhere with this bimbo he 's so crazy about . " I showed Darcy the letters I 'd picked out of his trash . It was wonderful watching her expression shift from amusement to distaste . " Oh God , would you let him suckle your hmphm-hmph ? " " Only if I doused it with arsenic first . " Darcy 's brow wrinkled . " Her bazookas must be huge . He could n't think what to compare ' em to . " I looked over her shoulder . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem romantic . " Darcy shoved the papers back in the file . " That was titillating stuff . Oh , bad joke . Now what ? " " I do n't know . He took his address book with him , but I do have this . " I flipped through the calendar pad and showed her the penciled initials scattered through the months . I could see Darcy 's mental wheels start to turn . " Wonder if she ever called him here , " she said . " She must have , do n't you think ? " She opened her top right-hand desk drawer and took out the log for incoming telephone calls . It was a carbonless system with a permanent record in yellow overlaid by white perforated originals . If a call came in for someone out of the office , she made a note of the date and time , the caller , and the return number , checking off one of the responses to the right , " Please call , " " Will call back , " or " Message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the relevant recipient . Darcy turned back to December 1 . It did n't take us long to find her . By comparing the log of Andy 's calls with the calendar pad , we came up with one repeat caller who left a number , but no name , always a day or two prior to Andy 's assignations . . . if indeed that 's what they were . " Do you keep crisscross around here ? " I asked . " I do n't think so . We used to have one , but I have n't seen it for months . " " I 've got last year 's in my office . Let 's see who 's listed at this number . We better hope it 's not a business . "  |p123I  pulled my keys out of my handbag as Darcy followed me . " You were supposed to turn those keys in , " she said in mild reproof . " Oh really ? I did n't know that . " I unlocked my office door and moved to the file cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , at least the year before , belonged to last name , Wilding , first name Lorraine . " You think it 's her ? " Darcy asked . " I know a good way to find out , " I said . The address listed was only two blocks from my apartment , down near the beach . " Are you sure you 're okay ? I do n't think you should be running around like this . " " Do n't sweat it . I 'm fine , " I said . The truth was , I was n't feeling all that terrific , but I did n't want to lay my little head down until a few questions had been answered first . I was running on adrenaline  --  not a bad source of energy . When it ran out , of course , you were up shit creek , but for the time being it seemed better to be on the move.  |p124I  had Darcy drop me off . In an interview situation I prefer to work alone , especially when I 'm not quite sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage one on one ; there 's more room to ad-lib and more room to negotiate . The apartment building was Spanish style , probably dating from the thirties . The red-tile roof had aged to the color of rust and the stucco had mellowed from stark white to cream . There were clumps of beaky-looking bird of paradise plants in front . A towering , sixty-foot pine tree enveloped the yard in shade . Bougainvillea was massed at the roofline , a tumble of magenta blossoms that spread out along the guttersand trailed like Spanish moss . Wood shutters , painted dark brown , flanked the windows . The loggia was chilly and smelled of damp earth . I knocked at apartment D. There was no sign of Andy 's car on the street , but there was still a possibility that he was here . I had no idea what I 'd say if he appeared at the door . It was nearly six and I could smell someone 's supper in the making , something with onions and celery and butter . The door opened and I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring out at me . " Janice ? " I said , with disbelief . " I 'm Lorraine , " she said . " You must be looking for my sister . " Once she spoke , the resemblance began to fade . She had to be in her mid-forties , her good looks just beginning to dehydrate . She had Janice 's blond hair and the same pointed chin , but her eyes were bigger and her mouth was more generous . So was her body . She was my height , probably ten pounds heavier , and I could see where she carried the excess . Her eyes were brown and she 'd lined them with black , adding false lashes as dense as paintbrushes . She wore snug white twill shorts and a halter top . Her legs had been shapely once , but the muscles had taken on that stringy look that connotes no exer/cise . Her tan looked like the comprehensive sort you acquire at a tanning salon  --  the electric beach . Andy must have been in heaven . I 've known men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over again , but the similarities are usually not so obvious . She looked hauntingly like Janice . The difference was that Lorraine was voluptuous where the former Mrs. Motycka tended toward the small , the dry , and the mean . Judging from Andy 's letter , Lorraine was freer with her affections than Janice ever was . She did things to him that made his syntax turn to hiccups . I wondered if his affair with Lorraine came before or after his divorce . Either way , the liaison was dangerous . If Janice found out about it , she would extract a pretty price . It crossed my mind briefly that someonemight have used this as leverage to secure his cooperation . " I 'm looking for Andy , " I said . " Who ? " " Andy Motycka , your brother-in-law . I 'm from the insurance companywhere he works . " " Why look at me ? He and Janice are divorced . " " He gave me this address in case I ever needed to get in touch . " " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looked at me with suspicion . " How well do you know Janice ? " I shrugged . " I do n't really . I used to see her at company parties before they split . When you first opened the door , I thought it was her , you look so much alike . " She took that in and digested it . " What do you want Andy for ? " " He disappeared yesterday and no one seems to know where he went . Did he say anything to you ? " " Not really . " " Mind if I come in ? Maybe we can figure what 's happening . " " All right , " she said reluctantly . " I suppose that 's okay . He never told me he gave anyone this address . " She stepped back and I followed her into the apartment . A small tiled entry dropped down two steps into a large living room . The apartment looked as if it had been furnished from a rental company . Everything was new , handsome , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the glass-and-brass coffee table , but that was the only indication that Christmas had come and gone.  |p126Lorraine  flicked the television off and motioned me to a chair . The upholstery had the tough , rubbery feel of Scotchgarding . Neither tears , blood , or spilled booze could penetrate such a finish . She sat down , giving the crotch of her shorts a pull so the inseam would n't bury itself in her private parts . " How 'd you say you know Andy ? Do you work for him ? " " Not really for him , but the same company . When did you see him last ? " " Three days ago . I talked to him on the phone Thursday night . He was taking his kids on New Year 's Eve so I was n't going to see him till late tomorrow anyway , but he always calls , regardless of what 's going on . When I did n't hear by this morning , I drove out to his place , but there 's no sign of him . Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck as close to the truth as I could , filling her in on the fact that he 'd departed Friday morning without giving any indication where he meant to go . " We need one of the files . Do you know anything about the claim he was working on ? There was a fire out at Wood/Warren about a week ago and I think he was doing some of the paperwork . " There was a startled silence and the barriers shot up again . " Excuse me ? " " Did he mention that to you ? " " What 'd you say your name was ? " " Darcy . I 'm the receptionist . I think I 've talked to you a couple of times on the phone . " Her manner became formal , circumspect . " I see . Well , Darcy , he does n't talk to me about his work . I know he loves the company and he 's fine at what he does . " " Oh , absolutely , " said I. " And he 's very well liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off without a word . We thought maybe some kind of family matter came up . He did n't say anything about going out of town for a few days ? " She shook her head . Judging from her attitude , I was almost certain she knew about the scam . I was equally certain she 'd never give a hint of confirmation . She said , " I wish I could help you , but he never said a word to me . In fact , I 'd appreciate a call myself when the man turns up . I do n't like to have to sit here and fret . " " I do n't blame you , " I said . " You can reach me at this number ifp127you need to , and I 'll check back with you if I hear anything . " I jotted down Darcy 's name and my telephone number . " I hope nothing 's wrong . " This seemed like the first sincere commentshe 'd made . " I 'm sure not , " I said . Personally , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd taken off . She 'd had a few minutes now to focus on my browless , burned face . " Uh , I hope this does n't seem rude , but were you in some kind of accident ? " " A gas heater blew up in my face , " I said . She made some sympatheticnoises and I hoped the lie would n't come back to haunt me . " Well , I 'm sorry I had to bother you on a holiday . I 'll let you know if we hear from him . " I got up and she rose as well , crossing with me to the front door . I walked home through streets beginning to darken , though it was not quite five . The winter sun had sunk and the air temperature was dropping with it . I was exhausted , secretly wishing I could check back into the hospital for the night . Something about the clean white sheets seemed inviting . I was hungry , too , and for once would have welcomedsomething more nutritious than peanut butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Daniel 's car was parked at the curb out in front of my apartment . I peered in , half expecting to find him asleep on the back seat . I went in through the gate and around the side of the building to Henry 's backyard . Daniel was sitting on the cinder-block wall that separated Henry 's lot from our neighbor to the right . Daniel , his elbows on his knees , was blowing a low , mournful tune on an alto harmonica . With the cowboy boots , the jeans , and a blue-denim jacket , he might have been out on the range . " ' Bout time you got home , " he remarked . He tucked the harmonicain his pocket and got up . " I had work to do . " " You 're always working . You should take better care of yourself . " I unlocked my front door and went in , flipping on the light . I slung my handbag on a chair and sank down on the couch . Daniel moved into my kitchenette and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What for ? I 'm never home . "  | " Lord . " He took out a stub of butter , some eggs , and a packet of cheese so old it looked like dark plastic around the edge . While I watched , he searched my kitchen cabinets , assembling miscellaneous foodstuffs . I slouched down on my spine , leaning my head against the back of the couch with my feet propped up on the ottoman . I was fresh out of snappy talk and I could n't conjure up a shred of anger . This was a man I 'd loved once , and though the feelings were gone , a certain familiarity remained . " How come this place smells like feet ? " he said idly . He was already chopping onions , his fingers nimble . He played piano the same way , with a careless expertise . " It 's my air fern . Somebody gave it to me as a pet . " He picked up the tag end of a pound of bacon , sniffing suspiciously at the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lasts longer that way , " I said . He shrugged and extracted the three remaining pieces of bacon , which he dropped into the skillet with a clinking sound . " God , one thing about giving up dope , food never has tasted right , " he said . " Smoke dope , you 're always eating the best meal you ever had . Helps when you 're broke or on the road . " " You really gave up the hard stuff ? " " ' Fraid so , " he said . " Gave up cigarettes , gave up coffee . I do drink a beer now and then , though I notice you do n't have any . I used to go to AA meetings five times a week , but that talk of a higher power got to me in the end . There is n't any power higher than heroin , you can take my word for it . " I could feel myself drifting off . He was humming to himself , a melodydimly remembered , that blended with the scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper being cooked by someone else ? He shook me gently and I woke to find an omelet on a warmed plate being placed in my lap . I roused myself , suddenly famished again . Daniel sat cross-legged on the floor , forking up eggs while he talked . " Who lives in the house ? " " My landlord , Henry Pitts . He 's off in Michigan . " " You got something goin ' with him ? " I paused between bites . " The man is eighty-two . " " He have a piano ? "  | " Actually , I think he does . An upright , probably out of tune . His wife used to play . " " I 'd like to try it , if there 's a way to get in . You think he 'd care ? " " Not at all . I 've got a key . You mean tonight ? " " Tomorrow . I got ta be somewhere in a bit . " The way the light fell on his face , I could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't aging well . He looked haggard , a gauntness beginning to emerge . " I ca n't believe you 're a private detective , " he said . " Seems weird to me . " " It 's not that different from being a cop , " I said . " I 'm not part of the bureaucracy , that 's all . Do n't wear a uniform or punch a time clock . I get paid more , but not as regularly . " " A bit more dangerous , is n't it ? I do n't remember anyone ever tried to blow you up back then . " " Well , they sure tried everything else . Traffic detail , every time you pull someone over , you wonder if the car 's stolen , if the driver 's got a gun . Domestic violence is worse . People drinking , doing drugs . Half the time they 'd just as soon waste you as one another . Knock on the door , you never know what kind of shit you 're dealing with . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It did n't start out like that . You know the family , by the way , " I said . " I do ? " " The Woods . Remember Bass Wood ? " He hesitated . " Vaguely . " " His sister Olive is the one who died . " Daniel set his plate down . " The Kohler woman is his sister ? I had no idea . What the hell is going on ? " I sketched it out for him , telling him what I knew . If I have a client , I wo n't talk about a case , but I could n't see the harm here . Just me . It felt good , giving me a chance to theorize to some extent . Daniel was a good audience , asking just the right questions . It felt like old times , the good times , when we talked on for hours about whatever suited us . Finally a silence fell . I was cold and feeling tense . I reached for the quilt and covered my feet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have understood . " He kept his tone light . " It was n't you , babe . It was n't anything personal . "  | " Was there someone else ? " He shifted uneasily , tapping with the fork on the edge of his dinner plate . He set the utensil aside . He stretched his legs out in front of him and leaned back on his elbows . " I wish I knew what to tell you , Kinsey . It was n't that I did n't want you . I wanted something else more , that 's all . " " What ? " He scanned my face . " Anything . Everything . Whatever came down the pike . " " You do n't have a conscience , do you ? " He broke off eye contact . " No . That 's why we were such a mismatch . I do n't have any conscience and you have too much . " " No , not so . If I had a conscience , I would n't tell so many lies . " " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one thing we had in common , " he said . His gaze came up to mine . I was chilled by the look in his eyes , clear and empty . I could remember wanting him . I could remember looking at his face , wondering if there could ever be a man more beautiful . For some reason I never expect the people I know to have any talent or ability . I 'd been introduced to Daniel and dismissedhim until the moment I heard him play . Then I did a long double-take , astonished , and I was hooked . There just was n't any place to go from there . Daniel was married to his music , to freedom , to drugs , and briefly , to me . I was about that far down on the list . I stirred restlessly . A palpable sexual vapor seemed to rise from his skin , drifting across to me like the scent of woodsmoke half a mile away . It 's a strange phenomenon , but true , that in sleeping with men , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept with before . Operant conditioning . The man had trained me well . Even after eight years , he could still do what he did best . . . seduce . I cleared my throat , struggling to break the spell . " What 's the story on your therapist ? " " No story . She 's a shrink . She thinks she can fix me . " " And this is part of it ? Making peace with me ? " " We all have delusions . That 's one of hers . " " Is she in love with you ? " " I doubt it . " " Must be early in the game , " I said . The dimple appeared and a smile flashed across his face , but it wasp131mirthless , evasive , and I wondered if I had n't touched on some pain of his . Now , he was the restless one , glancing at his watch . " I got to get , " he said abruptly . He gathered both plates and the silverware , toting dishes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old habit of his , so he did n't have much to do . By seven , he was gone . I heard the thunder and rattle of his car as he started it and pulled away . The apartment seemed dark . Extraordinarily quiet . I locked up . I took a bath , keeping the water away from my burns . I closed myself into the folds of my quilt and turned out the light . Being with him had brought back the pain in fossil form , evidence of ancient emotional life , embedded now in rock . I studied the sensations as I would some extinct subspecies , for the curiosity , if nothing more . Being married to a doper is as close to loneliness as you can get . Add to that his chronic infidelity and you 've got a lot of sleepless nights on your hands . There are certain men who rove , men who prowl the night , who simply do n't show up for hours on end . Lying in bed , you tell yourself you 're worried that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in jail . You tell yourself you 're worried he 's been rolled , mugged , or maimed , that he 's overdosed . What really worries you is he might be with someone else . The hours creep by . From time to time , you hear a car approaching , but it 's never his . By 4:00 A.M. , it 's a tossup which is uppermost in your mind  --  wishing he would come home or wishing he were dead . Daniel Wade was the one who taught me how to value solitude . What I endure now does n't hold a candle to what I endured with him.  |p132The  memorial service for Olive was held at 2:00 P.M. on Sunday at the Unitarian Church , a spartan ceremony in a setting stripped of excess . Attendance was limited to family and a few close friends . There were lots of flowers , but no casket in evidence . The floors were red tile , glossy and cold . The pews were carved and polished wood , without cushions . The lofty ceiling of the church lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoid of ornamentation and there were no religious icons at all . Even the stained-glass windows were a plain cream with the barest suggestion of green vines curling around the edges . The Unitarians apparently do n't hold with zealousness , piety , confession , penance , or atonement . Jesus and God were never mentioned , nor did the word " amen " cross anybody 's lips . Instead of scriptures , there were readings from Bertrand Russell and Kahlil Gibran . A man with a flute played several mournful classical tunes and ended with a number that sounded suspiciously like " Send In the Clowns . " There was no eulogy , but the minister chatted about Olive in the most conversational of tones , inviting those congregated to stand up and share recollections of her . No one had the nerve . I sat near the back in my all-purpose dress , not wanting to intrude . I noticed that several people nudged one another and turned to look at me , as if I 'd achieved celebrity status by being blown up with her . Ebony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as did her mother . Terry sat alone in the front row , leaning forward , head in his hands . The whole group did n't occupy more than about the first five rows . Afterward we assembled in the small garden courtyard outside where we were served champagne and finger sandwiches . The occasion was polite and circumspect . The afternoon was hot . The sun was bright . The garden itself was gaudy with annuals , gold , orange , purple , and red marching along the white stucco wall that enclosed the churchyard . The stone-and-tile fountain plashed softly , a breeze occasionallyblowing spray out onto the surrounding paving stones.  |p133I  moved among the mourners , saying little , picking up fragments of conversation . Some were discussing the stock market , some their recenttravels , one the divorce of a mutual acquaintance who 'd been married twenty-six years . Of those who thought to talk about Olive Wood Kohler , the themes seemed to be equally divided between conventionalsentiment and cattiness. " ... he 'll never recover from the loss , you know . She was everything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for that coat .. " . .. shocked . . . could n't believe it when Ruth called me . .. " " ... poor thing . He worshipped the ground she walked on , though I never could quite see it myself ... " " . . . tragedy . . . so young . .. " ... well , I always wondered about that , as narrow as she was through the chest . Who did the work ? " I found Ash sitting on a poured concrete bench near the chapel door . She looked drawn and pale , her pale-red hair glinting with strands of premature gray . The dress she wore was a dark wool , loosely cut , the short sleeves making her upper arms seem as shapeless as bread dough . In another few years she 'd have that matronly look that women sometimes get , rushing into middle age just to get it over with . I sat down beside her . She held out her hand and we sat there together like grade-school kids on a field trip . " Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a peculiar outing . Sometimes I still feel like I need a note from my mother . I scanned the crowd . " What happened to Ebony ? I do n't see her . " " She left just after the service . God , she 's so cold . She sat there like a stone , never cried a tear . " " Bass says she was a mess when she first heard the news . Now she 's got herself under control , which is probably much closer to the way she lives . Were she and Olive close ? " " I always thought so . Now I 'm not so sure . " " Come on , Ashley . People deal with grief differently . You never really know what goes on , " I said . " I went to a funeral once where a woman laughed so hard she wet her pants . Her only son had died in a car accident . Later , she was hospitalized for depression , but if you 'd seen her then , you never would have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gaze drift across the courtyard . " Terry got another phone call from that woman . " " Lyda Case ? " " I guess that 's the one . Whoever threatened him . " " Did he call the police ? " " I doubt it . It came up a little while ago , before we left the house to come here . He probably has n't had a chance . " I spotted Terry talking to the minister . As if on cue , he turned and looked at me . I touched Ash 's arm . " I 'll be right back , " I said . Terry murmured something and broke away , moving toward me . Looking at him was like looking in my mirror . . . the same bruises , same haunted look about the eyes . We were as bonded as lovers after the trauma we 'd been through . No one could know what it was like in that moment when the bomb went off . " How are you ? " he said , his voice low . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and steered me toward the entrance to the social hall . " She 's here in town . She wants to meet with me . " " Bullshit . No way , " I whispered hoarsely . Terry looked at me uneasily . " I know it sounds crazy , but she says she has some information that could be of help . " " I 'm sure she does . It 's probably in a box and goes boom when you pick it up . " " I asked her about that . She swears she did n't have anything to do with Olive 's death . " " And you believed her ? " " I guess I did in a way . " " Hey , you were the one who told me about the threat . She scared the life out of you and here she is again . If you wo n't call Lieutenant Dolan , I will . " I thought he would argue , but he sighed once . " All right . I know it 's the only thing that makes any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where 's she staying ? " " She did n't say . She wants to meet at the bird refuge at six . Would you be willing to come ? She asked for you by name . " " Why me ? " " I do n't know . She said you flew to Texas to talk to her . I ca n't believe you did n't mention that when the subject came up . "  | " Sorry . I guess I should have . That was early in the week . I was trying to get a line on Hugh Case , to see how his death fits in . " " And ? " " I 'm not sure yet . I 'd be very surprised if it did n't connect . I just ca n't figure out how . " Terry gave me a skeptical look . " It 's never been proven he was murdered , has it ? " " Well , that 's true , " I said . " It just seems highly unlikely that the lab work would disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the same person with a different motive this time . " " What makes you say that ? Carbon-monoxide poisoning is about as far away from bombs as you can get . Would n't the guy use the same method if it worked so well the first time ? " I shrugged . " I do n't know . If it were me , I 'd do whatever was expedient . The point is , this is not something we should fool around with on our own . " I saw Terry 's gaze focus on something behind me . I turned to see Bass . He looked old . Everybody had aged in the wake of Olive 's death , but on Bass the lines of weariness were the least flattering  --  something puffy about the eyes , something pouty about the mouth . He had one of those boyish faces that did n't lend itself to deep emotion . On him , sorrow looked like a form of petulance . " I 'm taking Mother home , " he said . " I 'll be right there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to me . " Do you want to call Lieutenant Dolan or should I ? " " I 'll do it , " I said . " If there 's any problem , I 'll let you know . Otherwise , I 'll meet you down at the bird refuge at six . " I was home by 3:35 , but it took me almost an hour to track down the lieutenant , who was certainly interested in having a chat with Lyda Case . He said he 'd be there at 5:00 in an unmarked car , on the off-chance that she was feeling truly skittish about contact with the police . I changed into jeans and a sweatshirt and pulled on my tennis shoes . I was tired , and the residual pain from my injuries was like a slow leak from a tire , depleting . Over the course of the day , I could feel myself go flat . In some ways I shared Terry 's sentiments . It was hard to believe Lyda was responsible for the package bomb , let alone her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the veiled threat to Terry , she did n't seem like the homicidal type , forp136whatever that 's worth . I 've been surprised by killers again and again , and I try not to generalize , but there it was . Maybe she was just what she claimed to be . . . someone with information that might be of help . By the time I reached the meeting place , the sun was almost down . The bird refuge is a landscaped preserve near the beach , established to protect geese , swans , and other fowl . The forty-three-acre property abuts the zoo and consists of an irregular-shaped freshwater lagoon , surrounded by a wide lane of clipped grass through which a bike trail runs . There 's a small parking lot at one end where parents bring little children with their plastic bags of old popcorn and stale bread . Male pigeons puff and posture in jerky pursuit of their inattentive female counterparts who manage to strut along just one step away from conception . I pulled into the lot and parked . I got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oddly choreographed dance of their own . Geese honked along the shore in search of crumbs while the ducks paddled through the still waters , sending out ripples around them . The sky was a deepening gray , the ruffled silver surface of the lagoon reflecting the rising wind . I was glad when Lieutenant Dolan 's car pulled in beside mine . We chatted idly until Terry appeared , and then the three of us waited . Lyda Case never showed . At 8:15 , we finally gave it up . Terry took Dolan 's number and said he 'd be in touch if he heard from her . It was a bit of a letdown , as all three of us had hoped for a break in the case . Terry seemed grateful for the activity and I had to guess that it was going to be hard for him to spend his first night alone . He 'd been in the hospital Friday night and with his mother-in-law on Saturday while the bomb squad finished their crime-scene investigation and a work crew came in to board up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of melancholy had returned in full force . Funerals and the New Year are a bad mix . The painkillers I 'd been taking dulled my mental processes and left me feeling somewhat disconnectedfrom reality . I needed companionship . I wanted lights and noise and a good dinner somewhere with a decent glass of wine and talk of anything except death . I fancied myself an independent soul , but I could see how easily my attachments could form . I drove home hoping Daniel would appear again . With him , youp137never knew . The day he walked out of the marriage eight years before , he had n't even left a note . He did n't like to deal with anger or recrimination . He said it bummed him out to be around people who were sad , depressed , or upset . His strategy was to let other people cope with unpleasantness . I 'd seen him do it with his family , with old friends , with gigs that no longer interested him . One day he was n't there , and you might not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even remember why you 'd been so pissed off . Sometimes , as in my case , there 'd be some residual rage , which Daniel usually found puzzling . Strong emotion is hard to sustain in the face of bafflement . You run out of things to say . Most of the time , in the old days , he was stoned anyway , so confronting him was about as productive as trying to discipline a cat for spraying on the drapes . He did n't " get it . " Fury did n't make any sense to him . He could n't see the connection between his behavior and the wrath that was generated as a consequence . What the man did really well was play . He was a free spirit , whimsical , inventive , tireless , sweet . Jazz piano , sex , travel , parties , he was wonderful at those . . . until he got bored , of course , or until reality surfaced , and then he was gone . I had never been taught how to play , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure it was anything I really needed to know . I found a parking spot six doors away . Daniel 's car was parked in front of my place . He was leaning against the fender . There was a paper bag with twine handles near his feet , a baguette of French bread sticking out of it like a baseball bat . " I thought you might be gone by today , " I said . " I talked to my friend . It looks like I 'll be here a couple days more . " " You find a place to stay ? " " I hope so . There 's a little motel here in the neighborhood that will have a room free later . Some folks are checking out . " " That 's nice . You can reclaim your stuff . " " I 'll do that as soon as I know for sure . " " What 's that ? " I said , pointing at the baguette . He looked down at the sack , his gaze following mine . " Picnic , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano some , too . " " How long have you been here ? " " Since six , " he said . " You feel all right ? You look beat . " " I am . Come on in . I hope you have wine . I could use some . "  |p138He  pushed away from the car , toting the bag as he followed me through the gate . We ended up at Henry 's , sitting on the floor in his living room . Daniel had bought twenty-five votive candles and he arrangedthose around the room until I felt like I was sitting in the middle of a birthday cake . We had wine , pate , cheeses , French bread , cold salads , fresh raspberries , and sugar cookies the size of Frisbees . I stretched out afterward in a food-induced reverie while Daniel played the piano . Daniel did n't play music so much as he discovered it , callingup melodies , pursuing them across the keys , embroidering , embellishing . His background was in classical piano , so he warmed up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over into improvisation without effort . Daniel stopped abruptly . I opened my eyes and looked at him . His expression was pained . He touched at the keyboard carelessly , a sour chord . " It 's gone . I do n't have it anymore . I gave up drugs and the music went with ' em . " I sat up . " What are you talking about ? " " Just what I said . It was the choice I had to make , but it 's all bullshit . I can live without drugs , babe , but not without music . I 'm not made that way . " " It sounded fine . It was beautiful . " " What do you know , Kinsey ? You do n't know anything . That was all technique . Mechanics . I got no soul . The only time music works is when I 'm burning with smack , flying . This is nothing . Half-life . The other is better . . . when I 'm on fire like that and give it all away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothin ' . " I could feel my body grow still . " What are you saying ? " Dumb question . I knew . His eyes glowed and he pinched his thumb and index finger together near his lips , sucking in air . It was the gesture he always used when he was about to roll a joint . He looked down at the crook of his elbow and made a fist lovingly . " Do n't do that , " I said . " Why not ? " " It 'll kill you . " He shrugged . " Why ca n't I live the way I want ? I 'm the devil . I 'm bad . You should know that by now . There is n't anything I would n't dop139just for the hell of it . . . just to stay awake . Fuck . I 'd like to fly again , you know ? I 'd like to feel good . I 'll tell you something about being straight . . . it 's a goddamn drag . I do n't know how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep from hangin ' yourself . " I crumpled up paper napkins and stuffed them in the sack , gathered paper plates , plastic ware , the empty wine bottle , cardboard containers . He sat on the piano bench , his hands held loosely in his lap . I doubted he 'd live to see forty-three . " Is that why you came back ? " I asked . " To lay this line of shit on me . What do you want , permission ? Approval ? " " Yeah , I 'd like that . " I started blowing out candles , darkness gathering like smoke around the edges of the room . You ca n't argue with people who fall in love with death . " Get out of my life , Daniel . Would you just do that ? "  |p140I  got up Monday morning at 6:00 and did a slow , agonizing five-mile jog . I was in bad shape and I had no business being out there at all , but I could n't help myself . This had to be the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shaping up all that great as far as I could see . It was now January 3 , and I wanted my life back the way it was . With luck , Rosie would reopen later in the day , and maybe Jonah would return from Idaho . Henry was flying home on Friday . I recited my blessings to myself as I ran , ignoring the fact that my body hurt , that I had no office at the moment , and a cloud of suspicion was still hanging over my head . The sky was clear , a torpid breeze picking up . The day seemed unseasonably warm even at that hour , and I wondered if we were experiencing Santa Ana conditions , winds gusting in from the desert , hot drafts like the blast from an oven . It was the wrong time of year for it , but the air had that dry , dusty feel to it . The sweat on my face evaporated almost at once and my T-shirt was clinging to my back like a hot , soggy rag . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd blown some of the tension away . Kinsey Millhone , perpetual optimist . I jogged all the way to Henry 's gate and took a few minutes walking back and forth , catching my breath , cooling down . Daniel 's car was gone . In its place was a vehicle I had n't seen before  --  a compact , judging from the shape , anonymous under a pale-blue cotton car cover . Off-street parking in the area is restricted and garages are rare . If I ever got a new car , I 'd have to invest in a cover myself . I leaned against the fence , stretching my hamstrings dutifully before I went in to shower . Lance Wood called me at 8:00 . The background noise was that hollow combination of traffic and enclosure that suggests a phone booth . " Where are you ? " I asked , as soon as he 'd identified himself.  | " On a street corner in Colgate . I think my phone at work is tapped , " he said . " Have you had it checked ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go about it and I feel like a fool asking the phone company to come out . " " I 'll bet , " I said . " That 's like asking the fox to secure the henhouse . What makes you think you 've got a tap ? " " Odd stuff . I 'll have a conversation and the next thing I know , something I 've said is all over the place . I 'm not talking about office gossip . It 's something more insidious than that , like comments I 've made to out-of-state customers that people here would have no way of knowing . " " Could it be a simple case of someone listening in ? A lot of employeeshave access to the phones out there . " " Not my private line . It is n't like anything we do is top secret , but we all say things we 'd rather not have spread around . Someone 's making me look very bad . Is there some way you can check it out ? " " I can try , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tried unscrewing the mouthpiece ? " " Sure , but I do n't know what the inside of a receiver 's supposed to look like . I 'm not picking up any odd noises or clicks , I will say that . " " You would n't if the tap is set up properly . It 'd be virtually undetectable . Of course , it might not be that at all , " I said . " Maybe the office itself is bugged . " " In which case , what ? Is that something you can spot ? " " Sometimes , with luck . It 's also possible to buy an electronic device that will scan for bugs . I 'll see if I can locate one before I come out . Give me a couple of hours and I 'll meet you at the plant . I 've got some other things I probably ought to take care of first . " " Right . Thanks . " I took the next hour to type up my notes , clipping the newspaper article about the explosion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone number in Texas on the off chance that her roommate had heard from her . It would help if I knew how to find her here in Santa Teresa . At 9:10 , my phone rang . It was Darcy calling from California Fidelityand talking as if she had a hand cupped over the mouthpiece . " Big trouble , " she said.  |p142I  could feel my heart sink . " Now what ? " " If I change the subject abruptly , you 'll know Mac walked in , " she murmured . " I overheard a conversation between him and Jewel . He says someone tipped the cops about the warehouse inventory . It looks like Lance Wood moved all the merchandise to another location before his warehouse burned down . The inventory he claimed reimbursement for was all worthless junk . " " That 's bullshit , " I said . " I saw some of it myself . I must have gone through five or six boxes when I inspected the place . " " Well , I guess he had a few real boxes seeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged , Kinsey . Arson and fraud , and you 're being named as co-conspirator . Mac turned everything over to the D.A . this morning . I thought you 'd like to know in case you need to talk to an attorney . " " What 's the timetable ? Do you know ? " " Mr. Motycka is n't in today , but I can leave a message on his desk , " she said . " Is that Mac ? " " He did n't say exactly , but we 're expecting him some time today . Uh  --  hun . Yes , I 'll do that . All right , thanks , " she said and hung up . I put a call through to Lonnie King and alerted him . He said he 'd check with the D.A . ' s office and find out if a warrant was being issued . His advice was to surrender voluntarily , thus avoiding the ignominy and uncertainty of a public arrest . " Jesus , I ca n't believe this is happening , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it until I tell you to , " he said . I grabbed my handbag and car keys and headed out the door . I had disconnected my emotions again . There was no point in letting anxiety get in my way . I hopped in my car and drove over to an electricalsupplyplace on Granita . My knowledge of electronic surveillance was bound to be out-of-date , limited to information picked up in a crash course at the Police Academy nearly ten years before . The advances in miniaturization since then had probably revolutionized the field , but I suspected the basics were always going to be the same . Microphone , transmitter , recorder of some type , probably voice-activated these days . The planting can be done by a technician disguised as any commonlyseen service person : telephone lineman , meter reader , cable/television installer . Electronic surveillance is expensive , illegal unless authorized by the court , and looks a lot easier on television than it is in real life . Bug detection is another matter altogether . It was always possible , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubted it . The small all-band receiver I bought was about the size of a portableradio . While not truly all-band , it was sufficient to cover most bugging frequencies  --  30  --  50 MHz and 88  --  108 MHz . If the bug in his office was wired , I was going to have to find the wire myself , but if the bug was wireless , the receiver would start emitting a high-pitched squeal when it was within range . I drove out to Colgate with my windows rolled down , parched air whipping through the interior of the VW like a convection oven . The weather forecaster on the car radio seemed as baffled as I was . It felt like August , asphalt shimmering in the heat . January in Santa Teresa is usually our best month . Everything is green , flowers in full bloom , the temperatures in the low seventies , mild and pleasant . The timeand-tempsign on the bank building was showing 89 degrees and it was n't yet noon . I parked in front of Wood/Warren and went in . Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleeves rolled up . " Do we need to watch what we say once we go in there ? " he asked , indicating the office door . " I do n't think so . Let 's let ' em know we 're hot on the trail . Maybe it 'll shake ' em up . " Before we started work , I did a quick check of both interior and exterior office walls on the off-chance that someone had installed a spike mike , a small probe that can be inserted between the studs , or hidden in a hollow door , the door panel itself serving as a diaphragm to transmit sound . Lance 's office was located in the right-front corner of the building . The construction on those two sides was block and fieldstone , which did n't lend itself to easy installation . Somebody would have had to drill through solid rock . Inside , one office wall was contiguous with the reception area , where the pickup unit would have been difficult to conceal . The fourth wall was clean . Company employees watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary phases of the search . If anyone **26;16021;TOOLONG Zoya this time , knowing full well that there was no hope of it . By then , Pershing and his staff were well ensconced in their headquarters on the rue Constantine , across from the Invalides , and he was living on the Left Bank , near the rue de Varennes , in a beautiful hotel particulier loaned to him by a fellow American , Ogden Mills , who was serving elsewhere in the infantry . " I want Feodor to go with you tonight , " her grandmother said darkly as she left for the Opera . " Do n't be silly , Grandmama , I 'll be fine . They ca n't be any different from Russian generals . I 'm sure they 're quite well behaved . They 're not going to storm the stage and carry us off with them . " Nijinsky was dancing with them that night and Zoya could hardly wait . Just being on the same stage with him was almost more than she could bear . " I 'll be fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Either Feodor , or Prince Vladimir . Take your choice . " She knew easily which one it would be , althoughshe secretly regretted it , but she had n't pressed Zoya about the Prince again . In a way , she knew Zoya was right , Vladimirwas a great deal too old for her . " All right . " Zoya laughed . " I 'll take Feodor . But he 'll be miserablewaiting backstage . " " Not if he 's waiting for you , my love . " The old servant served them with a devotion that bordered on the fanatical , and Evgenia knew that Zoya would be safe if he was standing by her . And Zoya only agreed to it to put her grandmother 's mind at rest . " At least tell him he must n't get in the way . " " He would n't think of it . " Together they took a taxi to the Opera , and within moments Zoya was swallowed up by preparations for the performance for Pershing and his men . She knew there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera Comique , the ComedieFrancaise , and in other theaters around town . Paris was opening its arms to them . And when the curtain went up that night , she danced as she never had before . Just knowing that Nijinsky was there spurred her on , and Diaghilev spoke to her himself at the end of the first act . She felt as though she could fly after hearing his kind words , and she put even more of herself into it , and was stunned to realize that the performance had flown by as the final curtain fell . Shep101wanted the evening never to end . She took her bows with the rest of the troupe , and retreated with the others to their common dressing room . The primas had their own of course , but it would be years before she could look forward to that , but she did n't really care . All she wanted was to dance , and she was . She had danced well , and she was filled with pride as she slowly untied her shoes . Her toes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to matter now . It was a small price to pay for so much joy . She had even forgotten the General and his staff . All she could think of that night was the ballet as she danced and danced and danced .. . and she looked up in surprise as one of the teachers entered the room . " You are all invited to a reception at the General 's home , " she announced . " Two military trucks will take you there . " She looked at them with pride . They had done well , each and every one of them . " Champagne for all ! " she added with a smile as everyone began to talk and laugh . Paris seemed to be coming alive again with the Americans at hand . There were parties and performanceseverywhere , and Zoya suddenly thought of Feodor waiting for her outside . She wanted desperately to go with them , to be like everyone else , in spite of her grandmother 's fears . She slipped quietly outside and went to look for Feodor , and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had told her grandmother he would . He felt ridiculous there , surrounded by women in leotards and tulle , and men striding past him less than half dressed . The obvious immorality of it horrified him . " Yes , mademoiselle ? " " I must go to a reception with the rest of the troupe , " she explained , " and I ca n't bring you , Feodor . Go home to Grandmama , and I 'll come home as soon as I can . " " No . " He shook his head solemnly . " I promised Evgenia Peterovna , I told her I would bring you home . " " But you ca n't come with us . I promise you I 'll be safe . " " She 'll be very angry with me . " " No , she wo n't . I 'll explain it to her myself when I come home . " " I will wait for you . " He looked at her stolidly and she wanted to scream . She did n't want a chaperone . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was n't a baby anymore after all . She was a grown woman , of eighteen . And perhaps , if she was very , very lucky , Nijinsky might speak to her . . . or Mr. Diaghilev again.  |p102She  was far more interested in them than in any of Pershing 's men . But first she had to convince Feodor to go home , and finally , after what seemed like endless arguments , he agreed to go , although he was certain the Countess would be furious at him . " I promise you , I 'll explain everything to her . " " Very well , mademoiselle . " He touched his brow , bowed , and left via the stage door , as Zoya gave a sigh of relief . " What was that all about ? " one of the other dancers asked as she walked past her . " Just a friend of the family . " She smiled . No one knew her circumstances here , and no one cared . All they cared about was the ballet , not maudlin tales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the old servant standing by like a Cossack Guard embarrassed her . She was relieved when he left , and she could return to the dressing room to change for the reception at General Pershing 's house . Everyone was in high spirits , and someone had already begun pouring them champagne . They piled into the military trucks happily , and crossed the Pont Alexandre III as they sang old Russian songs , and had to be remindedmore than once to behave themselves as they reached General Pershing 's house . But he seemed like a kindly man as he welcomed them , standing tall and slender in his full dress uniform , circulating in the elegant marble hall . And for an instant , Zoya felt her heart catch as she looked around . It reminded her of the palaces of St. Petersburg , although smaller of course . But the marblefloors and the columns and the sweeping staircases were all too familiar to her , and all too sharp a memory of the world she had only recently left behind . They were escorted into a large ballroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of it beautifully authenticLouis XV . And Zoya suddenly felt very young again , as the dancers cavorted and laughed , and a military band that had appearedbegan playing a slow waltz , as others drank champagne . She felt an overwhelming urge to cry as she listened to the music , and feeling breathless , she walked out into the garden beyond . She stood silently , staring at a statue by Rodin , wishing that she had n't come , when a voice directly behind where she stood spoke softly in the warm night . " May I get you something , mademoiselle ? " The voice was distinctlyAmerican , yet he spoke perfect French . She turned to see ap103tall , attractive man with gray hair and brilliant blue eyes looking at her , and the first thing she noticed about him was that he looked kind . He seemed to sense that something was wrong , and his eyes gently probed hers as she shook her head , the tears still glistening on her cheeks . " Are you all right ? " She nodded silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was wearing a simple white dress Alix had given her the year before . It was one of the few nice ones she had managed to bring from St. Petersburg , and she looked lovely as she stood looking up at him . " I 'm sorry . . . I . . . " How could she begin to tell him all that she felt ? She wished only that he would leave her to her memories , but he made no move to go as he watched her eyes . " It 's so beautiful here . " It was all she could say , but it brought the squalid apartment near the Palais Royal to mind , and remindedher again of how much their lives had changed , in sharp contrast to the elegant garden where she stood now . " Are you with the Ballet Russe ? " " I am . " She smiled , hoping he would forget her tears , as she listened to the distant strains of another waltz . She said the words with pride , thinking again how lucky she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed in embarrassment and came a little closer to her as she noticed again how tall and handsome he was . " I 'm afraid I 'm not a great devotee of the ballet , it was a command performance for some of us tonight . " " Aha ! " She laughed . " And did you suffer terribly ? " " Yes . " His eyes laughed back into hers . " Until just now . Would you like a glass of champagne ? " " In a minute perhaps . It 's so lovely out here . " The garden was so peaceful , as everyone danced and laughed and cavorted inside . " Do you live here too ? " He smiled and shook his head . " They have us billeted in a house on the rue du Bac . It 's not quite as palatial as this , but it 's very nice , and it 's quite nearby . " He was watching her as she moved . She was quiet and elegant , and there was more than just the grace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an aura of almost regal dignity as she moved her head , and a look of immeasurable sadness that belied her smile . " Are you on the General 's staff ? " " I am . " He was one of his aides-de-camp , but he spared her thep104details . " Have you been with the Ballet Russe for long ? " It could n't have been very long , he suspected that she was a very young girl , although she had a great deal of poise as they switched from French to English finally . She spoke it very well , after her studies at the Smolny Institute . " I 've been with them for a month . " She smiled at him . " Much to my grandmother 's chagrin . " She laughed and looked suddenly even younger . " Your parents must be very proud of you . " But he instantly regretted the remark as he saw the sadness in her eyes . " My parents were killed in St. Petersburg . . . in March . . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live with my grandmother . " " I 'm sorry . . . about your parents , I mean . . . " The flash of blue eyes nearly made her cry again . It was the first time she had said the words to anyone . Her fellow dancers knew little about her , but for some reason she felt she could say anything to him . He reminded her in an odd way of Konstantin , the same elegance , the graceful way he moved , the dark hair shot with gray , and the brilliant eyes . " You came here with your grandmother ? " He did n't know why , but he was fascinated by her . She was so young and so beautiful , with those big sad green eyes . " Yes , we came two months ago . . . from . . . after . . . " But she could n't go on , and he came and gently tucked her hand into his arm . " Let 's go for a walk , shall we , mademoiselle ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then perhaps a glass of champagne . " They wandered to the Rodin statue and back , talking about Paris , the war , subjects that were less painful to her , and then with a smile she looked up at him . " And where are you from ? " " New York . " She had never thought too much about the United States . It all seemed terribly far away . " What 's it like ? " He laughed as he looked down at her . " Big , busy . Not as pretty as this , I 'm afraid . But I like it there . " He wanted to ask her about St. Petersburg , but sensed that this was n't the time or the place . " Do you dance every day ? " " Almost . " And then she laughed up at him . " Until tonight 's performance , I was enjoying a week off . "  | " And what do you do then . . . in your spare time ? " " I go for walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... sleep . . . play with my dog . " " It sounds like a pleasant life . What kind of dog do you have ? " They were silly questions , but he wanted to keep her close to him , and he was n't sure why . She was clearly half his age , but so beautiful , it tore at his heart . " A cocker spaniel . " She smiled . " She was a gift from a very dear friend . " " A gentleman ? " He looked intrigued and she laughed . " No , no ! A girl ! My cousin , in fact . " " Did you bring the dog from Russia with you ? " He was fascinated by her as she bent her head , the cascade of fiery red hair hiding her eyes . " Yes , I did . I 'm afraid she made the journey rather better than I did . I arrived in Paris with measles . " She looked up at him again and grinned , looking once again like a child . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing about her seemed that to him , and then he suddenly realized he did n't even know her name . " Not at all . Do you suppose we ought to introduce ourselves ? " " Zoya Ossupov . " She curtsied prettily , and looked up at him . " Clayton Andrews . Captain Clayton Andrews , I suppose Ishould have said . " " My brother was a captain too . . . with the Preobrajensky Guard . I do n't suppose you 've ever heard of them . " She looked up at him expectantly , and once again he saw her eyes grow sad . Her moods seemed to change with lightning speed , and as he looked at her for the first time he understood why people said the eyes were the windows of the soul . Hers seemed to lead one into a magic world of diamonds and emeralds and unshed tears , and he wanted to make her happy again , to make her dance and laugh and smile . " I do n't know very much about Russia , I 'm afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled again . " I do n't know anything about New York . " He walked her back inside the main ballroom then and brought her a glass of champagne as the others danced the waltz . " Would you like to dance ? " She seemed to hesitate , and then nodded . He set her glass down on a table nearby , and led her onto the floor in a slow and dignifiedp106waltz , and once again she felt as though she were dancing in her father 's arms . If she closed her eyes , she would be back in St. Petersburg . . . but his voice broke into her thoughts . " Do you always dance with your eyes closed , mademoiselle ? " He was teasing her and she smiled up at him . It felt good to be in his arms , good to be dancing with a tall , powerful man . . . on a magical night . . . in a beautiful house .. . " It 's just so lovely here . . . is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed his time in the garden with her . It was easier talking to her there than with the music and the crowd . And at the end of the dance , General Pershing signaled him so he left her , and when he came back to look for her , she was gone . He looked everywhere , and walked out to the garden again , but she was nowhere in sight , and when he inquired , he was told that the first truckload of the Ballet Busse had left the party . He walked back to his own quarters thoughtfully , as he meandered down the rue du Bac , remembering her name , thinking of her big green eyes , and he found himself wondering who she really was . There was something deeply intriguing about her.  |p107The  next time I send Feodorsomewhere with you , Zoya Konstantinovna , you will please have the goodness not to send him home . " The old Countess was furious as they shared breakfast the next day . Feodor had come sheepishly back to her , and explained that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere , and he was n't included . Her grandmother had been waiting for her when she got back , almost too angry to speak to her , and by morning , her fury was still white-hot , as she glared at Zoya . " I 'm sorry , Grandmama . I could n't take Feodor with me . It was a beautiful reception at General Pershing 's quarters . " She rememberedinstantly the gardens and the Captain she had met , but she said nothing to her grandmother about any of it . " Ah ! So it 's come to that , has it ? Entertaining the troops ? And what is next ? This is precisely why proper young ladies do n't run away to join the ballet . It is not suitable , absolutely not . And I wo n't tolerate this . I want you to leave the ballet at once ! " " Grandmama .. please .. you know I ca n't ! "  | " You can if I tell you to ! " " Grandmama . . . please do n't . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had had such a nice time the night before . . . and the handsome Captain had been such a nice man , or at least he seemed like it . But still , she said nothing about him to her grandmother . It did n't seem appropriate , and she knew their paths would not cross again . " I 'm sorry . I wo n't do it again . " Not that she 'd have the opportunity anyway . General Pershing was hardly likely to give parties for the Ballet Busse after every performance . She stood up as her grandmother glared at her . " Where are you going now ? " " I have a rehearsal today . " " I 'm so tired of this ! " She stood up and paced around the room as best she could , but she was still very spry . " Ballet , ballet , ballet ! Enough ! " " Yes , Grandmama . " She was going to sell a necklace again , an emerald one this time . Maybe Zoya would give up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . She was not a dancer . She was a child . " What time will you be home tonight ? " " I should be back at four o'clock . Rehearsal starts at nine , and I do n't have a performance tonight . " " I want you to think about leaving them . " But Zoya enjoyed it too much , they both knew that , and the money did help , much as the Countess hated to think about it . She had bought her grandmothera pretty dress and a warm shawl the week before . And her wages helped pay for their food as well , although there were no little extra treats , except those Vladimir still brought in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Zoya . " We 'll go for a walk this afternoon when I come home . " " What makes you think I 'd be willing to go for a walk with you ? " her grandmother growled , and Zoya laughed . " Because you love me so much . And I love you too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , like a schoolgirl late for class . The old woman sighed and cleared away the breakfast plates . It was so difficult having her here . Things were so different , and the hardest part was that much as the old woman hated to admit it to herself , Zoya was no longer a child , and it was n't easy to control her . Zoya 's rehearsal was at the Opera again that day , in preparationp109for another performance the following night , and she danced and rehearsed and practiced at the barre for hours and when she finished shortly before four o'clock , she was tired after the late night at General Pershing 's house . It was a sunny afternoon in the last week of June , and she walked out into the sunlight with a contented sigh . " You sound tired , Miss Ossupov . " She wheeled in surprise at the sound of her name , and saw Clayton Andrews standing next to one of General Pershing 's staff cars . " Hello . . . you startled me . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting here for two hours . " He laughed and she looked at him with wide eyes . " Have you been waiting for me all this time ? " " I have . I never got a chance to say good-bye to you last night . " " I think you were busy when I left . " " I know . You must have gone back on the first truck . " She nodded in answer , surprised that he had taken the trouble to find out . She had n't thought she would see him again , but she was happy seeing him now . He was as handsome as she had thought him the night before , as tall and lean and graceful as he had seemed when they danced the waltz . " I was hoping you 'd have lunch with me . But it 's a little late now . " " I have to go back to my grandmother anyway . " She smiled up at him , dallying like a schoolgirl just released from class . " She 's dreadfully cross at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark . " Did you go home very late ? I did n't notice the time when you left . " Then she was as young as he 'd thought . She had the looks of a very young girl , the innocence ... and yet , there was such wisdom in her eyes . But Zoya laughed at the memory of sending Feodor away from the opera house . " My grandmother sent someone to chaperone me , and I sent him home . I suspect he was quite glad of it , though , and so was I. " She blushed slightly then and he laughed . " In that case , mademoiselle , may I offer you my escort now ? I could drive you home . " She hesitated , but he was so obviously a gentleman , there could be no harm in it , and who would know ? She could leave him a block or two before the Palais Royal . " Thank you very much . " He opened the door for her and she slid into the car . She told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove her home . She had him stop a block away and he looked around . " Is this where you live ? " " Not quite . " She smiled and blushed again . " I thought I 'd spare my grandmother the agony of getting angry at me again so soon after last night . " He laughed at her , his handsome face looking very young despitethe silver hair . " Are n't you a naughty child ! And if I ask you to join me for dinner tonight , mademoiselle ? What then ? " She knit her brows as she thought of it , and then looked at him . " I 'm not sure . Grandmama knows there is no performance tonight . " It would be the first time she had ever been dishonest with her and she herself was n't sure why she felt she had to be now . But she knew how Evgenia felt about soldiers . " Wo n't she let you go out with anyone ? " He seemed both amused and surprised . " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , dear . . . am I allowed to ask how old you are in that case ? " Perhaps she was even younger than he thought , but he hoped not . " Eighteen . " She said it almost defiantly , and once again he laughed . " Does that seem very old to you ? " " Old enough . " He did n't dare ask for what . " Not long ago , she was encouraging me toward a friend of the family . " And when she said it , she blushed . It seemed stupid to tell him about Vladimir , but he did n't seem to mind . " And how old is he ? Twenty-one ? " " Oh , no ! " Zoya was laughing now . " Much , much older than that . He 's at least sixty years old ! " This time , Clayton Andrews looked both amused and startled . " Is he ? And what does your grandmother think of that ? " " It 's too complicated to explain , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old man . " He looked at her seriously for a moment as they sat in the car . " So am I. I 'm forty-five years old . " He wanted to be honest with her , right from the start . " And you 're not married ? " She seemed surprised , and then realized that perhaps he was . " I 'm divorced . " He had been married to one of the Vanderbilts ,  |p111but  it had ended ten years before . In New York , he was thought to be an enviable catch , but in the ten years since his divorce , and among the flocks of women he 'd taken out , none of them had snagged his heart . " Are you shocked ? " " No . " She thought about it and then looked him in the eye , convinced more than ever that he was a decent man . " Why did you get divorced ? " " We fell out of love , I suppose . . . we were very different from the start . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see her very often anymore . She lives in Washington now . " " Where 's that ? " It all sounded far away and mysterious to her . " It 's near New York but not near enough . Rather like Paris and Bordeaux . Or Paris and London perhaps . " She nodded . That much made sense . But he glanced at his watch . He had spent hours waiting for her and now he had to get back . " What about dinner tonight ? " " I do n't think I can . " She looked sadly up at him , and he smiled . " Tomorrow then ? " " I have to dance tomorrow night . " " What about afterward ? " He was persistent in any case , but having found her again , he was not going to let her slip past him . " I 'll try . " " Good enough . Till tomorrow night then . " He sprang from the car and helped her out . She thanked him politely for the ride , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rue Constantine with a song in his heart as he thought of Zoya.  |p112For  the first time in her life , she lied to her grandmother . It was the following day when she left for the Opera again . She felt guilty about it , but by the time she left the house , she had forgiven herself for what seemed like a harmless lie . She was sparing her worry about something that was n't worth worrying about , she told herself . After all , what harm was there in one dinner with a nice man ? She had told her that Diaghilev was giving a supper for them , and it was an obligation for the entire ballet troupe . " Do n't wait up for me ! " she had called over her shoulder so Evgenia could not see her eyes . " Are you sure you must go ? " " Absolutely , Grandmama ! " And then she had hurried out the door for rehearsal . And after the performance , Clayton was waiting for her , with another of General Pershing 's cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slid behind the wheel as he watched her eyes . They spoke volumes , far more than her words , and they were the color of emeraldsfull of fire . " How was it tonight ? "  | " It was all right . But Nijinsky did n't dance tonight . He 's remarkable , do n't you think ? " And then with a giggle , she remembered that he did n't like the ballet . " Never mind , I forgot you do n't like ballet . " " Perhaps I can be taught . " They drove straight to Maxim 's , and Zoya 's eyes grew wide as they walked in the door . The rich velvet decor and crowds of elegant people and men in dress uniforms dining there made her catch her breath as she looked up at him . It all seemed so grown-up , and a little startling , and she thought instantly of how to describe her surroundings in her next letter to Marie . But Clayton Andrews was going to be difficult to explain , even to her closest friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining with him , except that he 'd been so kind to her , and he seemed so happy and at ease . She found herself wanting to talk to him , just this once . . . or perhaps one more time after that . There was no harm in it . He was respectable , and there was a certain excitement to it . She tried not to act like an excited child as they sat down at the table . " Hungry ? " He eyed her happily as he ordered champagne for them , but she just wanted to look around . " Have you ever been here before ? " She shook her head , thinking of the apartment where they lived , and the hotel where they had stayed before that . They had n't been to any restaurants at all since they 'd arrived . She and her grandmother cooked simple meals at home , and Feodor sat down to dinner with them every evening . " No . " She did n't explain . It would have been difficult to explain it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I used to come here before the war . " " Do you travel a great deal ? Usually , I mean . " " Enough . Had you ever been to Paris before . . . I mean before you came here three months ago ? " He had remembered that and she was touched . " No . But my parents used to come here a lot . My mother was actually German , but she 'd lived in St. Petersburg most of her life . " He found himself suddenly wanting to ask her what the revolution had been like , but sensed wisely how painful it had been for her , and refrained . And then , just to make conversation with her , he casually asked a question which made her laugh . " Zoya , did you ever see the Tsar ? " And at the look of amuse/ment on her face , he began to laugh too . " Is there something funny about that ? " " Perhaps . " She felt so comfortable with him , she decided to open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But her face grew serious then , remembering her last morning at Tsarskoe Selo . Clayton patted her hand , and poured her champagne . " Never mind . . . we can talk about something else . " But as she looked at him , her eyes reached into his . " It 's all right . . . I just . . . " She fought back tears as she looked at him . " I just miss them so much . Sometimes I wonder if we 'll ever see them again . They 're still under house arrest now , at Tsarskoe Selo . " " Do you hear from them ? " He looked surprised . " I get letters sometimes from the Grand Duchess Marie . she 's my very dearest friend . She was very ill when we left . " Andthen she smiled sadly at the memory . " I caught the measles from her . They all had them before we left . " It all seemed remarkable to him as he listened to her . The Tsar of Russia was a figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young girl . " And you grew up with all of them ? " She nodded and he smiled . He had been right after all . There was a great deal more to her than one would have thought at first sight . She was n't just a pretty little ballerina . She was a girl from a fine family , a girl with a remarkable past . She began to tell him about it then , about the house where she 'd grown up , about Nicolai. . . and the night he 'd been shot , and staying at Tsarskoe Selo before they left Russia . " I have such wonderful photographs of them . I 'll show you sometime . We went to Livadia together in August every year . They 're going this year again , or so Marie said when she last wrote . We always celebrated Alexis 's birthday there , or on the yacht . " Clayton Andrews watched her with fascinated eyes as they talked . She spoke of a magical world , at a rare time in history , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and tennis , and dogs . And now she was dancing with the Ballet Russe . No wonder her grandmother sent a chaperone with her . She even explained Feodor to him . And by the end of the evening , he felt as though he knew them all , and his heart ached for the life she had lost in Russia . " What will you do now ? "  | " I do n't know . " She was honest with him . " When there is no more jewelry left to sell , I suppose I 'll just go on dancing and we 'll live on that . Grandmama is too old to work , and Feodor does n't speak enough French to get a job , and he 's also quite old . " And when they died ? He did n't even dare think of it . She was so open and innocent and fresh , and yet she had seen so much . " Your father sounds like a nice man , Zoya . " " He was . " " It 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never going back . " " Grandmama thinks things might change after the war . Uncle Nicky said as much before we left . " Uncle Nicky . . . the Tsar Nicholas . . . it still amazed him as he listened to her talk . " At least , for now , I can dance . I used to want to run away to the Maryinsky School when I was a little girl "  --  she laughed at the memory now  --  " this is n't so bad . I 'd rather dance than teach English , or sew , or make hats . " He laughed at the look on her face as she listed the alternatives . " I 'd have to admit , I ca n't quite imagine you making hats . " " I 'd rather starve . But we wo n't . The Ballet Busse has been very good to me . " She told him about her first audition , and he silently marveled at her courage and ingenuity . Even having dinner with him was rather brave . And he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though she was barely more than a child . But he also saw her differently now than he had the other evening . She was n't just a pretty face , or a member of the corps de ballet . She was a girl from a family even more illustrious than his own , and even though she had nothing left , she had breeding and dignity , and he had no desire to violate that . " I wish you could meet Grandmama , " she said as though reading his thoughts . " Perhaps I shall sometime . " " She 'd be shocked that we have n't been properly introduced . I 'm not sure I could explain that to her . " " Could we say I 'm a friend of Diaghilev 's ? " he asked hopefully , and she laughed . " That would be even worse ! She hates all of it ! She 'd far rather I marry Prince Markovsky with his taxi than work at the ballet . " But as he watched her , he understood why . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprotected , unknown , an easy prey for anyone , even himself.  |p116He  paid for their midnight supper then and she looked sad as he took her home . " I 'd like to see you again sometime , Zoya . " It seemed such a trite thing to say to her , but he was suddenly uncomfortable about making their outings clandestine . She was so young , and he did n't want to hurt her in any way . " What if I come to tea sometime with your grandmother ? " Zoya looked terrified at the thought . " What will I say to her ? " " I 'll think of something . What about Sunday afternoon ? " " We usually go for a walk in the Bois de Boulogne . " " Perhaps we could take a drive . Say four o'clock ? " Zoya nodded , wondering what she would say to her grandmother , but his suggestion was simpler than all her schemes . " You might just tell her that I 'm General Pershing 's aide , and we met at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth than a lie . " He sounded just like Konstantin again , as he had several times that night , and she smiled happily up at him . " My father would have said something like that . " And as they pulled up in front of her address , she glanced at him , looking handsome and dignified in his uniform . He was a wonderful-lookingman . " I had a lovely time tonight . " " So did I , Zoya . . . so did I. " He gently touched the long red hair , and wanted to pull her close to him , but he did n't dare . He walked her to her door and saw her safely inside , as she waved for a last time , and darted up the stairs to the apartment.  |p117Clayton  's introduction to her grandmotherwent far more easily than either of them had dared to hope . Zoya explained breezily that she had met him at General Pershing 's soiree for the Ballet Russe , and she had invited him to tea . Evgenia was hesitant at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose circumstances were as restrained as theirs , but not someone they scarcely knew . But Zoya bought half a dozen little cakes for them , a much sought after loaf of bread , and her grandmother brewed a pot of steaming tea . They had no other niceties to offer him , no silver tray , no lace napkins or cloth , no samovar , but Evgenia was far more concerned about why he wanted to visit them than she was about the elegance of what they could offer him . But as Feodor opened the door to him promptly at four o'clock , Clayton Andrews himself dispelled almost all her fears . He brought them both flowers , and a lovely apple tart , and he was every inch a gentleman as he greeted them both , Zoya quite formally , and her grandmother with respectable warmth . He seemed almost not to notice Zoya at all that day as he chattedp118comfortably about his travels , his small knowledge of Russian history , and his own youth in New York . And like Zoya , Evgenia found herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wit , his charm . And when at last she sent Zoya out of the room to make another pot of tea , she sat quietly watching him , knowing full well why he had come to visit her . He was too old to dally with the child , and yet she could not bring herself to disapproveof him . He was a fine and worthy man . " What do you want with her ? " The old woman asked in a soft voice , unexpectedly , while Zoya was still out of the room , and he met the old woman 's eyes with honesty and kindness . " I 'm not sure . I 've never even talked to a girl her age before , but she 's quite remarkable in many ways . Perhaps I can be a friend to her . . . to both of you ? ... " " Do n't play with her , Captain Andrews . She has her whole life ahead of her , and it could be changed unpleasantly by what you do now . She seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But neither of them thought it was . The old woman knew even better than he that once he brought her close to him , Zoya 's life would never be quite the same again . " She is still very , very young . " He nodded quietly , thinking of the wisdom of her words . More than once in the past week he had told himself that he was foolish to pursue a girl so young . And when he left Paris afterward , then what ? It would n't be fair to take advantage of her and then move on . " In another world , another life , this would n't even have been possible . " " I 'm well aware of that , Countess . But on the other hand "  --  he made a quiet case for himself  --  " times have changed , have n't they ? " " Indeed they have . " And with that , Zoya came back to them , and poured each of them a cup of tea . She showed him her photographsthen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , the Tsarevich sitting next to her on the yacht , and others with Olga and Marie , Tatiana , Anastasia , Aunt Alix , and the Tsar himself . It was almost like a lesson in modern history , and more than once Zoya looked up at him with a happy smile , remembering , explaining it all to him as he listened to her , and he knew the answer then to Evgenia 's questions . He felt far morep119than friendship for this girl . Even though she was barely more than a child , there was something remarkable in her soul , somethingthat reached out and touched him to the core , something he had never felt before , for anyone . And yet , how could he possibly offer her anything ? He was forty-five years old , divorced , and he had come to France to fight a war . There was nothing he could offer her just then , if he ever could . She deserved a younger man , someone to grow up with and laugh with , and share all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around her and promise that nothing would ever hurt her again . He took them for a drive when she put her photographs away , and when they stopped to walk in the park , he watched her playing with Sava on the grass , as the puppy leapt and barked , while Zoya ran laughing and almost collided with him . Without thinking , he put his arms around her and held her close to him , and she looked up at him , laughing like the child he 'd seen in the photographs . Evgenia watched them both , and feared what was to come . When he brought them home again , Evgenia thanked him and looked at him quietly as Zoya went to give Sava to Feodor . " Think carefully , Captain . What for you may be only an interlude could change my granddaughter 's life . Be wise , I beg of you . . . and above all . . . be kind . " " What did you say to him just then , Grandmama ? " Zoya asked when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tart , and invited him to visit us again , " Evgenia said calmly as she put their cups away . " That 's all ? He looked so serious , as though you 'd said something important to him . And he did n't smile when he said good-bye . " " Perhaps he 's thinking about all this , little one . " And then , carefully , " He 's really far too old for you . " " It does n't matter to me . He 's such a nice man . " " Yes , he is . " Evgenia nodded quietly , hoping silently that he would be nice enough not to call again . Zoya was too much at risk with him , and if she fell in love with him , what then ? It could prove to be disastrous.  |p120Evgenia  's prayers that Clayton Andrewswould not return were not destined to be answered . After trying to stay away from her for a week , he found himself constantlythinking of her , obsessed with her eyes . . . her hair .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her play with Sava . . . even the photographs she had shown him of the family of the Tsar seemed to haunt him . She had made them real to him , and now instead of a tragic figure of history the Tsar had become a man , with a wife , a family , and three dogs , and Clayton found himself mourning the enormity of his losses as he sat imprisoned in his home in Tsarskoe Selo . And as he thought of her all week , Zoya also found herself constantly thinking of Clayton . He reappeared at Zoya 's home this time , and not the ballet , and with her grandmother 's permission , took her to see The Merry Widow . She returned to excitedly tell her grandmother all of it , barely stopping for breath , as Clayton laughed and poured champagne . He had brought them a bottle of Cristal which he pouredp121into crystal glasses . Without wanting to offend them , he found himself constantly wanting to make things easier for them , and bring them the little niceties he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he insisted had been " given " to him , a set of glasses , a lace tablecloth , and even a pretty little bed for Sava . Evgenia knew by then that Clayton was badly smitten , as was Zoya . They went for long walks in the park , had lunch at little cafes , as Clayton explained the passing uniforms to her , the Zouaves , the English and Americans in khaki , the " poilus " in their pale blue coats , and even the Chasseurs d'Afrique . They talked of everything from ballet to babies . Zoya still insisted that one day she wanted six children , the thought of which made him laugh . " Why six ? " " I do n't know . " She shrugged with a happy smile . " I prefer even numbers . " She shared her last letter from Marie , it spoke of Tatianafalling ill again , though not seriously this time , and Nagorny being so faithful and kind to Alexis . He never left his side now . ... And Papa is so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happy and cheerful ... " It was difficult to imagine and it tore at Clayton 's heart as he listened . But they spoke of far more than the Tsar 's family when they met , they spoke of all their passions and interests and dreams . It was a magical and lovely summer for Zoya . Whenever Zoya was n't dancing , Clayton seemed to be there , amusing her , taking her out , and bringing them both small gifts and thoughtful little treasures . And then in September , all the innocent pleasures ended all too quickly . General Pershing announced to his aides that he was moving General Headquarters to Chaumont , on the Marne , and in a matter of days Clayton was to leave Paris . At the same time , Diaghilev was making plans to take the Ballet Busse to Portugal and Spain , and Zoya was faced with a painful decision . She could n't leave her grandmother alone , and she had to abandonthe troupe , which almost killed her . " You can dance with one of the other ballets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Clayton encouraged , but it was to her . No other company was the Ballet Busse , and it broke her heart to leave them . The worst news of all came two weeks after Alexis 's birthday . Zoya received a letter from Marie , sent to her , as always , by Dr. Botkin . On August 14 , the entire Romanov family had beenp122removed from house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo to Tobolsk in Siberia . The letter had been written the day before they left , and Zoya had no idea how they were , only that they had gone . The thought was almost more than she could bear . She had imagined that at any moment they would go to Livadia and be safe there . But now everything had changed , and a sense of terror clutched her heart as she read the letter . She showed it to Clayton before he left , and he tried vainly to reassure her . " You 'll hear from her again soon . I 'm sure of it , Zoya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she not , he asked himself . She had lost everything only months before , she had seen all too clearly the terrors of the revolution , and the truth was that her friends and relatives were still in danger . It frightened him too to think of it now , but there was nothing anyone could do to help them . The American government had recognized the Provisional Government long since , and everyone was afraid to offer the Tsar and his family asylum . There was no wresting him from the revolutionariesnow . All one could do was pray and believe that one day they 'd be free . It was the only hope he could offer to Zoya . And worst of all , he himself was leaving . " It 's not very far . I 'll come up to Paris whenever I can . I promise . " She looked up at him with tragic eyes . . . her friend .. . the Ballet Russe . . . and now he had to leave her . He had been courting her for almost three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement . Much to Evgenia 's relief , she rightly suspected that he had not done anything she would considerfoolish . He simply enjoyed her company , and saw her whenever he could , for walks , an evening at the theater , dinner at Maxim 's , or at some little bistro . And she seemed to flourish with his affectionate interest and protection . It was almost like having a family again , and now she was losing him as well , and at the same time she had to find a job with a lesser troupe . Much as she hated the thought , Evgenia knew that they were becoming dependent on Zoya 's income . By September 10 , she had found another job , but with a ballet company she abhorred , they had no precision , no style , and none of the brutal discipline of the Ballet Russe that Zoya was used to , and the pay was much less as well . But at least she , Feodor , and her grandmother were still eating . The war news was not good and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter from Marie . Theyp123were living in the Governor 's house in Tobolsk , and Gibbes , their tutor , was continuing their lessons . " . . . Papa reads us history almost every day , and he built us a platform on the greenhouse so we can take a little sun , but it will be too cold for that soon . They say the winters here seem endless .... " Olga had had her twentysecondbirthday , and Pierre Gilliard was there too . " ... He and Papa saw wood , almost every day , but at least while they 're busy , we can escape some of our lessons . Mama looks very tired , but Baby worries her so much . He was feeling so ill after the trip , but I 'm happy to tell you that now he is much better . The four of us sleep in one room here , and the house is very small , but at the same time cozy . Perhaps a bit like your apartment with Aunt Evgenia . Give her my love , dearest , dearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your dancing sounds fascinating , when I told Mama she was shocked , and then she laughed and said how very like you to go all the way to Paris to run off to the ballet ! We all send you our love , and I most especially . . . " And this time , she signed her letter as she had n't in a very long time , " OTMA . " It was a code they had devised as children for letters sent from all of them , signifying Olga , Tatiana , Marie , Anastasia . And it made Zoya 's heart long for them all . With Clayton gone , she was even more lonely . There was nothing to do but work and come home to Grandmama after each performance . She realized then the extent to which Clayton had spoiled her . When he was around , there were always outings , presents , surprises , plans . And now , suddenly , there was nothing . She wrote to him even more often than she wrote to Marie in Tobolsk , but his answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work to do in Chaumont for General Pershing . October was even worse , Feodor caught the Spanish flu , and Zoya and her grandmother took turns nursing him for weeks , but finally , unable to eat or drink , or even see anymore , he succumbed , as both women sat crying silently at his bedside . He had been so loyal and kind to them , but like an animal taken too far from his home , he was unable to survive in a different world . He smiled gently at them before he died , and said softly , " . . . Now I can go back to Russia .... " They buried him in a little cemetery outside Neuilly , Vladimir had driven them there , and Zoya cried all the way home , feeling as though she had lost her only remaining friend . Everything seemedp124suddenly so grim , even the weather . Without Feodor there was never enough firewood and both Evgenia and Zoya could n't bring themselves to use his room . It was as though the pain of their losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris in almost two months , and when Zoya came home from work late one night , she got a dreadful shock as she opened the door and saw a man standing in their living room in his shirt sleeves . And for a moment , Zoya 's heart stopped because she thought he was a doctor . " Is something wrong ? " He looked at her in equal amazement , as he stared at her withwide eyes , momentarily silenced by her unexpected beauty . " I'msorry , mademoiselle . . . I . . . your grandmother ... " " Is she all right ? " " Yes , of course . I believe she is in her room . " " And who are you ? " Zoya could n't understand what he was doing there in his shirt sleeves , and she almost reeled from his next words . " Did n't she tell you ? . . . I live here . I moved in this morning . " He was a pale , thin , youngish man in his early thirties , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marked limp as he went back to Feodor 's room and closed the door , as Zoya flew into hers in a fury . " What have you done ? I ca n't believe it ! " Zoya stared at her angrily as she sat in the bedroom 's only chair , and then Zoya noticed that Evgenia had moved a few more things into their room for their private comfort . " Who is that man ? " She offered no preamble , she could n't believe what her grandmother had done , as Evgenia looked up quietly from her knitting . " I 've taken in a boarder . We had no choice . The jeweler offered me absolutely nothing for my pearls , and there 's very little left toH sell . Sooner or later we would have had to do it . " Her face was filled with quiet resignation . " Could n't you have at least asked , or even warned me ? I 'm not a child , and I live here too . That man is a total stranger ! What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of your jewels ? What if he gets drunk . . . or brings in awful women ? " " Then we 'll ask him to leave , but calm yourself , Zoya , he seems perfectly nice , and very shy . He was wounded at Verdun last year , and he 's a teacher . "  | " I do n't care what he is . This apartment is too small to take in a stranger , and we get enough money from my dancing . Why this ? " She felt as though she 'd lost her home to him , and she just wanted to sit down and cry at the indignity of it . For her , it was the final blow . But to Evgenia , it had seemed the only way out . And she had n't told Zoya because she had suspected how she 'd react . And Zoya 's outrage only confirmed it . " I ca n't believe you would do this ! " " We had no choice , little one . Perhaps later we can do something different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even make a cup of tea now in my nightgown . " Her eyes were filled with tears of rage and sorrow . " Think of your cousins and what their life must be like in Tobolsk . Ca n't you be as brave as they are ? " The words made Zoya feel instantly guilty , as she slowly deflated and sank into the chair her grandmother had vacated to go and stand by the window . " I 'm sorry , Grandmama . . . I just . . . I was so shocked ... " She smiled then , looking almost mischievous but not quite . " I think I frightened him to death . He ran into his room and bolted the door after I shouted at him . " " He 's a perfectly nice young man . You should apologize to him in the morning . " But Zoya did n't answer her as she contemplated the extremes they had come to . Everything seemed so constantly dreary . Even Clayton seemed to have let her down . He had promised to come to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no hope of it for the moment . She wrote to him the next day , but she was too embarrassed to mention their boarder . His name was Antoine Vallet , and he looked terrified when he saw her in the morning . He apologized profusely , knocked over a lamp , almost broke a vase , and stumbled as he made every effort to get out of her way in the kitchen . She noticed he had sad eyes , and she almost felt sorry for him , but not quite . he had invaded the last bastion they had , and she was n't anxious to share it . " Good morning , mademoiselle . Would you like some coffee ? " he offered , and the aroma was pleasant in the kitchen , but she shook her head and growled at him . " I drink tea , thank you very much . " " I 'm sorry . " He stared at her in terrified admiration , and left the kitchen as quickly as he could . And shortly after that , he left top126teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , he was back again , sitting in the living room , at the desk , correcting papers . Zoya slammed into her room and paced nervouslyas she glanced at her grandmother . " I suppose this means I ca n't ever use the desk again . " She wanted to write a letter to Clayton . " I 'm sure he wo n't be there all night , Zoya . " But even her grandmother seemed to be confined to their room . There was nowhere she could go to be alone , no way she could collect her own thoughts , or get away from any of them . It seemed unbearablesuddenly , and she was sorry she had n't gone to Portugal with the Ballet Russe , but as she wheeled around and saw tears in Evgenia 's eyes , she felt a knife of guilt pierce her heart as she dropped to her knees and put her arms around her . " I 'm so sorry . . . I do n't know what 's wrong with me . I 'm just tired and nervous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It was Clayton . And just as had been foreseen , he had left to fight the war , and Zoya had to go back to a life without him . It was just as well that nothing more had happened , and that he was an honorable man , or it would have been even more difficult for her . She did n't ask Zoya if she 'd heard from him . She almost hoped that he would n't write her . Zoya went to the kitchen and cooked dinner for her grandmotherand herself , and as the young teacher kept looking up , in the direction of the good smells , Zoya relented , and invited him to join them for dinner . " What do you teach ? " she asked politely without really caring . She saw that his hands shook very badly , he seemed constantly frightened and very nervous , and it seemed to her that his war wounds had left him far more than a limp . He seemed perpetually shaken . " I teach history , mademoiselle . And I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she conceded , but barely . She was n't proud of the troupe she danced with now , not like when she was with the Ballet Russe , however briefly . " I 'm very fond of the ballet . Perhaps I could come to see you sometime . "  |p127She  knew he expected her to say that she would like that , but she could n't bring herself to do it . She would n't . " I like the room very much , " he announced to no one in particular , and Evgenia smiled graciously . " We are very happy to have you . " " The dinner is very good . " " Thank you , " Zoya said , without raising her eyes . He spoke in a series of irrelevant non sequiturs and Zoya disliked him more than ever . He limped around the kitchen trying to help her clean up , and afterward he lit a fire in the living room , annoying her again by wasting the little firewood they had , but as long as he had lit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing in the small apartment . " I visited Saint Petersburg once . " He spoke softly from the desk , hardly daring to look up at her , she was so beautiful and so full of fire . " It was very lovely . " She nodded and turned her back to him , staring into the fire with tears in her eyes as he watched her slim back with silent longing . He had been married before the war , but his wife had left with his best friend , and their only child had died of pneumonia . He had his own sorrows too , but Zoya did not ask to hear them . To her he was a man who had lived through great danger and barely survived it . And rather than strengthening him , it had broken his spirit . She turned slowly to look at him then , wondering again why her grandmother had taken him in . She could n't bear to think that their situation was that desperate , but she knew it was , or Evgenia would n't have done it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just a statement , but he rose quickly and put another log on the fire . " I 'll get some more firewood tomorrow , mademoiselle . That willhelp . Would you like another glass of tea ? I could make it for you . " " No , thank you . " She wondered how old he was , he looked to bei somewhere in his mid-thirties . In fact , he was thirty one , but his life had been far from easy . And then , shyly , " Is it your room I have taken ? " It would have explained her obvious displeasure at his presence , but she only shook her head , and then sighed . " One of our servants came with us from Russia . He died in October . " He nodded quietly as he listened . " I 'm sorry . It 's been a hard time for all of us . How long have you been in Paris ? "  | " Since last April . We left right after the revolution . " He nodded again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're brave , good people . " He wanted to say " and you too , " but he did n't dare . Her eyes were so big and bright and fierce , and as she tossed her head , her hair flew around her like sacred fire . " Is there anything you 'd like me to do , since I 'm here ? I 'd be happy to help in any way I can . I can do errands for your grandmother , if you like . I enjoy cooking as well . Perhaps we can take turns cooking dinner . " She nodded in silent resignation . Perhaps he was n't so bad . But he was there . And she did n't want him . He gathered his papers up then and went back to his room , closing the door behind him , as Zoya stood alone , staring into the fire , and thinking of Clayton.  |p129As  the winter wore on , people seemed hungrier and poorer as the weather got worse , and with more and more emigres turning up in Paris , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last pair of earrings on December first , and she was horrified at how little they gave her . All they had were Zoya 's wages now , and they were barely enough to feed them and pay for the apartment . Prince Markovskyhad his own troubles too . His car kept breaking down , and he seemed thinner and hungrier each time they saw him . He still spoke valiantly of better times , and reported on all the new arrivals . In the face of such poverty , and the bitter cold and lack of food , Evgenia was even more grateful for the presence of their boarder . His own meager salary barely allowed him to pay the cost of the room , but nonetheless he always managed to bring home something extra , half a loaf of bread , or a log for the fire , or even a few books for Evgenia to read . He even managed to find some for her in Russian , some poor emigres must have even sold their books forp130a meager loaf of stale bread . But he always seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , he brought some small offering home to Zoya . Once he had even heard her say how much she loved chocolates , and somewhere , by some miracle , he had managed to buy a tiny bar of chocolate . As the weeks wore on , she was kinder to him , grateful for his gifts , but more grateful for the kindness he showed the Countess . She was beginning to suffer from rheumatism in her knees and just getting up and down the stairs was suddenly agony for her . Zoya came home one afternoon from a rehearsal at the ballet , and found him carrying her grandmother up the stairs , which , with his wounded leg , was a painful task for him , but he never complained . He was always anxious to do more , and Evgenia had grown very fond of him . She was also not unaware of the enormous crush he had on Zoya . She mentioned it more than once to the girl , but Zoya insisted that she had n't noticed . " I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little one . " But Zoya was more concerned by the terrible cough that racked her grandmother as she said it . She had had a cold for weeks , and Zoya feared the Spanish flu that had killed Feodor , or the dreaded tuberculosis that seemed to be devouring Paris . Even her own health was not as strong as it had once been . With so little food , and such hard work , she had gotten desperately thin , and her girlish face seemed suddenly much older . " How 's your grandmother tonight ? " he asked quietly one night as they were cooking together in the kitchen . It was a nightly ritual between them now . They no longer took turns on her nights off , but instead they cooked together , and when she had to work , he cooked for Evgenia himself , more often than not supplying the food himself , buying it on the way home with the pennies he earned from his teaching . Like everyone else in Paris these days , his small funds seemed to be dwindling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Zoya with worried eyes , as she sliced two ancient-looking carrots to divide among the three of them . She was sick to death of stew , but it seemed to be what they ate almost every night , it was the easiest way to conceal the inferiorquality of the meat and the near absence of vegetables . " I 'm worried about her cough , Antoine . " Zoya glanced at him from across the kitchen . " I think it 's worse , do n't you ? " He nodded unhappily and added two small cubes of meat to the pot wherep131Zoya was boiling the carrots in a watery broth . There was n't even any bread tonight . It was fortunate that none of them were very hungry . " I think tomorrow I 'll take her to the doctor . " But even that was more than they could afford , and there was nothing left to sell , only her father 's last cigarette case , and three silver souvenir boxes that had been her brother 's , but Evgenia had promised her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a doctor on the rue Godot-de-Mauroy , if you want his name . He 's cheap . " He did abortions for the prostitutes , but he was better than most in that milieu . Antoine had gone to him for his leg several times , and had found him skilled and sympathetic . It pained him terribly now in the bitter cold and damp of winter . Zoya had noticed that his limp seemed to be getting worse , but he looked happier than he had when he 'd first come to live with them . It seemed to do him good to have decent people to come home to , and her grandmother to worry about . It never occurred to her that his feelings for her kept him alive , and that at night he lay in bed and dreamed of her in the next room , sleeping huddled with Evgenia . " How was school today ? " she asked as she waited for the pot to boil . Her eyes were kinder now when she looked at him . He even dared to tease her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded her of her brother . He was not a handsome man , but he was bright , and well read , and he had a good sense of humor . It helped during the air raids and the cold nights . It was what got them by in place of food and warmth and life 's little pleasures . " It was all right . I 'm looking forward to the holidays , though . It will give me a chance to catch up on my reading . Do you want to go to the theater sometime ? I know someone who might let us in at the Opera Comique , if you want to try it . " The mention of it reminded her of Clayton and the gentler days of summer . She had n't heard from him in a while , and assumed he was busy with General Pershing , who was designing the entire French campaign , and Zoya knew it was very secret . God only knew when she would see him again , if ever . But she was used to that now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once loved . It was difficult to imagine loving anyone without losing them . She forced her mind away from Clayton and back to Antoine and his offer to go to the theater . " I 'd love to go to a museum sometime . " He was actually goodp132company , and very cultured , though not in the polished sense of her lost Russian friends . But in a quiet way all his own , which was equally pleasant . " As soon as school is out , we 'll go . How 's the stew ? " he inquired , and she laughed . " As rotten as ever . " " I wish we could get some decent spices . " " I wish we could get some real vegetables and fruit . If I see another old carrot , I think I may scream . When I think of the food we used to eat in St. Petersburg , I could cry . I never even thought of it then . You know , I even had a dream about food last night . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't tell her that , he only nodded and helped her to set the table . " How 's your leg , by the way ? " She knew he did n't like to talk about it , but more than once she had wrapped a hot water bottle for him and he 'd taken it to bed and said it had helped him . " The cold does n't help much . Just be glad you 're young . Your grandmother and I are n't as lucky . " He smiled at her and watched her ladle out the thin stew into three chipped ugly bowls . It would have made her cry if she had let herself think of the beautiful china they 'd dined on every night at the Fontanka Palace . There was so much they had taken for granted that they would never see again . It was horrifying to think of it now , as Antoine went to knock on her bedroom door to bring Evgenia to dinner . But he looked worried when he returned alone and eyed Zoya over the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think I should get the doctor for her tonight ? " Zoya hesitated for a long moment , weighing the decision . A night call to the house would be even more expensive than a visit to his office . " Let 's see how she is after dinner . She may just be tired . I 'll bring her some tea in a little while . Is she in bed ? " He shook his head with a look of concern . " She 's dozing in the chair , with her knitting . " She had been working on the same tiny square of wool for months , promising that one day it would becomea sweater for Zoya . The two of them sat down to dinner then , and by silent agreementdid not touch the third bowl , no matter how hungry they were . There was still a chance that Evgenia might decide she wanted her dinner . " How was rehearsal ? " He was always interested in what she did ,  |p133and  although he was n't handsome , there was a boyish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he parted carefully in the middle , and nice hands , which she had noticed long since . They no longer shook , and though he was constantly in pain from his leg , he no longer seemed as nervous . " It was all right . I wish the Ballet Busse would come back . I miss dancing with them . These people do n't know what they 're doing . " 3ut at least it was money for food . A job was too precious to lose in the winter of 1917 in Paris . " I ran into some people in a cafe today who were talking about the coup d'etat in Russia last month . It was an endless discussion about Trotsky and Lenin and the Bolsheviks with two pacifists who got so mad , they threatened to punch the other two . " He grinned impishly . " It was pacifism at its best . I actually enjoyed the discussion . " There was a great deal of hostile feeling against the Bolsheviksat the time , and Antoine shared the pacifist view like so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have on the Romanovs , " Zoya voiced quietly . " I have n't had a letter from Siberia in a long time . " It worried her , but perhaps Dr. Botkin had n't been able to get her letters to Mashka . One had to consider that , and be patient in waiting for an answer . Everything seemed to require patience these days . Everyone was waiting for better times . She only hoped that they all lived to see them . There was even talk of the possibility of Paris being attacked , which seemed hard to believe with English and American troops swarming all over France . But after what she 'd seen in Russia only nine months before , she knew that anything was possible . She stood up then , and took the remaining bowl of stew to her grandmother 's room , but she came back with it a few minutes later , and spoke softly to Antoine in the kitchen . " She 's asleep . Maybe we should just let her sleep . I put a blanket over her to keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given them the previous summer . " Do n't forget to give me that doctor 's name tomorrow before you go to school . " I le nodded and then looked at her questioningly . " Do you want me to go with you ? " But she only shook her head , she still had a strong streak of independence . She had n't come this far , almost on her own , in order to depend on anyone now , even someone as unassuming as their boarder.  |p134She  finished the dishes and sat down in the living room , as close to the fire as she could , and warmed her hands as he quietly watched her . The fire shot gold lights into her hair , and her green eyes seemed to dance . And unable to resist the lure of her , he found himself standing nearby , partially to keep warm , and partiallyjust to be near her . " You 've got such pretty hair .... " He said it without thinking , and then blushed as she looked up at him in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the insulting exchanges with Nicolai they had so loved . " I 'm sorry . . . I did n't mean to be rude ... I was thinking of my brother . " She stared into the fire pensively , as Antoine watched her . " What was he like ? " His voice was gentle , and he thought his heart would break in half , he was so hungry to reach out and touch her . " He was wonderful . . . thoughtful and funny and daring and brave , and very , very handsome . He had dark hair like my father , and green eyes . " And then suddenly she laughed , remembering . " He had a great fondness for dancers . " Most of the imperial family had and Nicholas among them . " But he 'd be so angry at me now . " She looked up at Antoine with a sad smile . " He 'd be furious at my dancing now . . . " Her thoughts drifted off again as Antoine watched her . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we must to survive . There are n't many choices . You must have been very close . " " We were . " And then , out of nowhere , " My mother went mad when they killed him . " Her eyes filled with tears as she thought of him bleeding to death in the front hall , and her grandmother tying her petticoats over his wounds to no avail to try and save him . It was almost more than she could bear thinking about it , as Sava came quietly to her chair and licked her hand , and forced her mind back to the present . They sat quietly for a long time . He had pulled up the room 's only other chair , and they sat by the fire , lost in their own thoughts , until Antoine dared to be a little braver . " What do you want to do with your life ? Have you ever thought about it ? " She looked surprised at the question . " Dance , I suppose . " " And after that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rare opportunity to find her alone without Evgenia.  | " I used to want to marry and have children . " " And now ? Do n't you think about that anymore ? " " Not very often . Most dancers never get married . They dance until they drop , or teach , whichever comes first . " Most of the great dancers she knew had never married , and she was n't sure she cared . There was no one she knew that she could imagine marrying . Clayton was only a friend , Prince Markovsky was too old , and the men in her troupe were beyond hope , and she certainly could n't imagine herself married to Antoine . And there was no one else . Besides , she had to take care of Evgenia . " You 'd make a wonderful wife . " He said it so seriously that she laughed . " My brother would have said you were crazy . I 'm a terrible cook , I hate to sew . I ca n't do watercolors or knit . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters now . . . " She smiled at the thought as he watched her . " There 's more to marriage than cooking and sewing . " " Well , I certainly do n't know if I 'm good at that ! " She blushed and laughed and he blushed too . He was easily shocked and she had shocked him . " Zoya ! " " Sorry . " But she looked more amused than contrite as she stroked little Sava . Even Sava had grown thin from the meager remains from their table . " Perhaps one day someone will make you want to give up dancing . " He had misunderstood , it was n't that her passion for the ballet was so great . It was only that she had no choice . She had to work to support herself and Evgenia , and it was all she knew how to do . At least it was something . " I 'd better get Grandmama into bed , or her knees will be killing her tomorrow . " She stood up and stretched and Sava followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was changinginto her nightgown . " Do you want your stew , Grandmama ? " It was still waiting for her in the kitchen , but she shook her head with a tired smile . " No , darling . I 'm too tired to eat . Why do n't you save it for tomorrow ? " With all of Paris starving , it would have been a crime to waste it . " What have you been doing in the other room ? " " Talking to Antoine. "  | " He 's a good man . " She said it looking pointedly at Zoya , who seemed not to notice . " He gave me the name of a doctor on the rue Godot-de-Mauroy . I want to take you there tomorrow before rehearsal . " " I do n't need a doctor . " She was braiding her hair and a moment later she climbed painfully into bed . The room was cold , and the pain in her knees was brutal . " I do n't like the sound of your cough . " " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least I 'm still alive . " " Do n't talk like that . " She had only been saying things like that since Feodor died . His death had depressed her deeply , that and the fact that she knew they were almost at the end of their money . Zoya put her own nightgown on , and turned off the light , and she held her grandmother close to keep her warm as they huddled through the December night together.  |p137The  doctor Zoya took her grandmotherto said that it was only a cough and not tuberculosis . It was worth paying the price for the good news , but Zoya had had to give him almost the last of their money . Even his small fee was too much for their empty pockets . But she said nothing to Evgenia as Prince Markovsky drove them back to their apartment . He cast several meaningful glances at Zoya , which she ignored , and she left him chatting with her grandmother at the apartment when she went to rehearsal . And when she came back that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor had given her some cough medicine , and it seemed to be helping . Antoine was already in the kitchen , cooking dinner . He had brought home a chicken that night , which was a rare treat . It meant they would not only have dinner out of it , but soup for the next day . And as she set the table for the three of them , she found herself wondering if Mashka now had the same considerations . Perhaps a chicken looked luxurious to her now too . If they had been together they could have laughed about it . But now there was no one to laugh with.  | " Hello , Antoine . " She smiled at him and thanked him for the name of the doctor . " You should n't have wasted the money , " Evgenia reproached from a chair near the fire . Vladimir had brought them firewood . It was suddenly a day of unexpected riches . " Grandmama , do n't be foolish . " The three of them enjoyed the chicken , which he served swimming in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fire . And when her grandmother went to bed , Antoine stayed to talk to her again . They seemed to be doing a lot of that , but at least he was someone to talk to . He was talking about his Christmases as a child , and his eyes shone as they talked . He loved being near her . " Our Christmas is later than yours . It 's on January sixth . " " The Feast of Kings . " " There are beautiful processions all over Russia . Or there were . I suppose we 'll be going to the Russian church here . " In a way , she was looking forward to it , and in another way she knew it would be depressing . All those lost souls , standing together in the candlelight , remembering a lost world . She was n't sure she could bear it , but she knew that her grandmother would insist that they go . There would certainly be no gifts this year . There was n't a spare penny with which to buy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had bought her a warm scarf and a pair of warm gloves , and a tiny , tiny bottle of the perfume she had casually mentioned to him once . It was the perfume that touched her heart and brought tears to her eyes . It was " Lilas , " which Mashka had so loved and had given her months before . She took the top off the flacon , and the sweet smell brought back the touch and feel and smell of all that she loved , and her beloved Mashka . There were tears rolling slowly down her cheeks as she looked at him , and without thinking , with childlike grace , she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him . It was a sisterly kiss , but his whole body trembled to feel her near him . And Evgenia looked on with tears in her own eyes . He was not what she would have wished for Zoya once upon a time , but he was a decent , hardworking man , and she knew he would take good care of Zoya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had given him her blessing . She was feeling weaker day by day , and she was terrified that if she died therep139would be no one to take care of Zoya . She had to marry him now , for her grandmother 's peace of mind . But Zoya had no idea what they had planned , as she thanked him warmly for the perfume . He had given her grandmother an embroidered shawl and a book of Russian poems . And Zoya was embarrassed that all they had bought him was a clean notebook and a book about Russia . She had found it at a bookseller 's on the Quai d'Orsay , at an ugly little stand , but it was in French , and she thought he might like it . But not nearly as much as she liked the perfume . Her grandmother quietly slipped away with her gifts , and softly closed her bedroom door , silently wishing him success , and prayingthat Zoya would be wise and accept him . " You must have spent every penny you had , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal poker and Sava wagged her tail as she watched her . " That was foolish , but kind , Antoine . Thank you so much . I will use the perfume for special occasions . " She had already decided to wear it two weeks later on Russian Christmas . She did n't want to waste it before that . He sat down in the chair across from hers and took a breath , trying to muster up his courage . He was thirteen years older than she , but he had never been so frightened in his life . Even Verdun had been less terrifying than facing Zoya . " I wanted to talk to you about a special occasion , Zoya . Now that you mention it . " He could feel his palms grow damp as she watched him strangely . " What does that mean ? " " It means . . . " He could feel his heart pound . " It means . . . I love you . " She could hardly hear the words , but she stared at him in amazement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've loved you since the day I arrived here . Somehow , I thought that you suspected . " " Why would I ever suspect that ? " She looked both startled and angry . He had spoiled everything . How could they be friends now if he was going to be so stupid . " You do n't even know me ! " " We 've lived together for two months . That 's long enough . It would n't even have to be any different than this . We could stay here , except that you would sleep in my room . " " How lovely . " She stood up and paced the room . " A mere change of rooms , and we go on just as we are . How can you evenp140suggest it ? We 're all starving , none of us has a sou , and you want to get married . Why ? Why ? I do n't love you , I do n't even know you , nor you me Antoine , we are strangers ! " " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best marriagesstart that way . " " I do n't believe that . I want to be in love with the man I marry , madly , passionately , totally . I want it to be wonderful and roman-tic . " He looked so sad as she shouted at him , but she was shouting more at the fates that had put them there , than at the man who had bought her her favorite perfume . " Your grandmother thinks we could be very happy . " But it was the worst thing he could have said , as she strode around the room again in barely controllable fury . " Marry my grandmother then ! I do n't want to get married ! Not now ! Everything around us is sick and cold and dying . Everyone is starving and poor and miserable . What a way to start a life ! " " What you 're really saying is that you do n't love me . " He sat down quietly , willing to accept even that . And suddenly his own quiet actions subdued her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own warm ones . " No , I do n't . But I like you . I thought you were my friend . I really never thought there was anything else behind it . Not seriouslyanyway . You never said . . . " Her eyes filled with tears . " I was afraid to . Will you think about it , Zoya ? " But she shook her head sadly . " Antoine , I could n't do it . It would n't be fair to either of us . We both deserve more than this . " She glanced around them , and then back into his eyes . " And if we loved each other , even this would n't matter . But it does . I just do n't love you . " " You could try . " He looked so young , despite his injuries and his losses . " No , I could n't . I 'm so sorry . . . " She left the room then , and quietly closed the door to her own room , leaving the perfume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him then , and turned off the lights and went back to his bedroom . Perhaps she would change her mind . Perhaps her grandmother could convince her . She had thought it such a sensible plan . But he knew it was born not of love , but desperation . " Zoya ? " Her grandmother was watching her from their bed , asp141she undressed , facing the garden . Evgenia could n't see her face , but she suspected instinctively that she was crying . And as Zoya turned around in her nightgown , her green eyes were blazing . " Why did you do it , Grandmama ? Why did you encourage him to do that ? It was cruel to both of us . " She thought of the pain in Antoine 's eyes and she felt terrible . But not terrible enough to marry him out of pity . She had to think of herself too . And she knew she did n't love him . " It 's not cruel . It 's sensible . You must marry someone , and he 'll take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable , and he loves you . " " I do n't love him . " " You 're a child . You do n't know what you want . " She suspected also that Zoya was still dreaming of Clayton , a man more than twice her age , from whom she had n't heard since November . " I want to love the man I marry , Grandmama . Is that so much to ask ? " Tears rolled down her cheeks , as she sank into the room 's only chair and clutched Sava . " Normally , no , it 's not . But in these circumstances , it is . You have to be sensible . I 'm old , I 'm sick . What are you going to do when I die ? Stay here alone and go on dancing ? You 'll become old and hard and bitter . Stop this nonsense now . Accept him , and make yourself learn to love him . " " Grandmama ! How can you say that ! " " Because I 've lived a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give in , and when to make compromises with my heart . Do n't you think I would like to see you married to a handsome prince , back in St. Petersburg , in a house like Fontanka ? But there are no princes anymore , they 're all driving taxis . Fontanka is gone , Russia is gone . This is all there is , Zoya , perhaps forever . You must make adjustments . I wo n't leave you alone . I want to know you 'll be well cared for . " " Do n't you care that I do n't love him ? " Evgenia shook her head sadly . " It does n't matter , Zoya . Not now . Marry him . I do n't think you 'll regret it . " But he 's ugly , she wanted to scream . . . he 's crippled and lame . . . but in her heart of hearts , she knew that none of those things would matter to her if she loved him . Life with Antoine would always be sad , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought ofp142having children with him made her want to cry even harder . She did n't want his babies , did n't want him . She just could n't . " I ca n't . " She felt as though she were choking . " You can . And you must . For me , Zoya . . . do it for me , before I die . Let me know that you are safe with a man who will protect you . " " Protect me from what ? From starvation ? We 're all starving here together . He ca n't change any of that . And I do n't care . I would rather starve here alone than be married to a man I do n't love . " " Do n't make up your mind , little one . Think about it . Give it a little time . Please . . . for me . . . " Her eyes begged and Zoya 's streamed with tears as though her heart were broken . But the next morning , there were no tears . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to know , without any doubt in your mind , that Iwo n't marry you , Antoine . I want to forget this ever happened . " " I ca n't do that . I ca n't live here with you like this , knowing howbadly I want you . " " You did before . " She was suddenly terrified they 'd lose their boarder . " That was different . You did n't know then , now you do . " " I 'll pretend you never said it . " She looked frightened and childlikeagain , and he smiled sadly at her . " That does n't work . Are you sure , Zoya ? Ca n't you think about it for a while ? " " No . And I do n't want to give you false hopes . I ca n't marry you . I wo n't . Ever . " " Is there someone else ? " He knew she had an American friend , but he had never thought it was serious between them . " No , not like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up my dreams now , I 'll have nothing . They 're all I have left . " " Perhaps things will be better after the war . Perhaps we could even get our own apartment . " His dreams were so small , and hers were still so much larger , as she shook her head , and this time he believed her . " Antoine , I ca n't . You must believe me . " " Then I 'll have to move out . " " Do n't . . . please . . . I swear I 'll stay out of your way . Grandmama will be heartbroken if you go . "  | " And you , Zoya ? " She stood watching him in silence . " Will you miss me ? " " I thought you were my friend , Antoine , " she said sadly . " I am . I will always be . But I can not stay here . " He had some pride left , but as he packed his things that afternoon , Zoya panicked . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . Without his contribution to the rent , and the food , they 'd be even more desperate . " I ca n't help that " was his only answer . Evgenia even talked to him , assuring him that she would talk some sense into Zoya , but he knew better . He had seen Zoya 's eyes and heard her words . And she was right . She could n't marry a man she did n't love . She was n't that kind of woman . " It 's better that I go . I will look for another room tomorrow . " " She 's a foolish girl . " And Evgenia told her as much again that night . She was wasting her only chance at marriage . " I do n't care if I never get married , " Zoya answered with fresh tears . And in the morning when she got up , Antoine had left her a letter and taken his things and gone . There were three crisp bills on the table and the letter wished her a happy life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her for Christmas . Evgenia sobbed when she saw it , and Zoya quietly put the three crisp bills in her pocket.  |p144The  next two weeks were bleak in the apartment near the Palais Royal . The ballet was closed for three weeks , and despite their putting out the word through Vladimir , no new boarder appeared . Filled with grief over what Zoya had done , Evgenia seemed to have aged almost overnight , and althoughher cough was better , she seemed to be failing . She reproachedZoya almost daily about Antoine , and their financial situation became so desperate that shortly after the New Year , Evgenia struggled down the stairs and had Vladimir drive her to the jeweler in the rue Cambon . It was hardly worth the trip , but she felt she had no choice . She carefully unwrapped the package she had brought and revealed Konstantin 's gold cigarette case , and three of Nicolai 's silver souvenirboxes . They were covered with enamel replicas of his militaryinsignia , engraved with amusing slogans and his friends ' names , one of them bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enamel elephants . They represented all the things he held dear or that meant something to him , and had each been gifts fromp145friends . She had promised herself and Zoya long before that she would never sell them . The jeweler recognized them instantly as pieces by Faberge , but he had already seen more than a dozen more like them . " I ca n't offer you very much , " he apologized , and the sum he wrote down brought tears to her eyes , but they had to eat . And she had so hoped they could keep them . " I 'm sorry , madame . " She inclined her head in silent dignity , bereft of words , and accepted the small sum he offered . It would keep them for less than a week , if they did n't buy anything too extravagant . Prince Vladimir noticed that the old woman looked pale when she emerged , but as always , he asked no vulgar questions . He simply drove her home , after stopping to buy a loaf of bread and a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , looking subdued , but extremely pretty . " Where were you ? " she asked as she settled her grandmother into a chair , and Vladimir went downstairs to bring up some more firewood . " Vladimir took me out for a drive . " But Zoya suspected more than that . " Is that all ? " She started to say yes but tears filled her eyes , and she began to cry , feeling tired and old , and as though life had finally betrayed her . She could n't even allow herself to die . She still had Zoya to think of . " Grandmama , what have you done ? " Zoya was suddenly frightened , but the old woman blew her nose on the lace handkerchief she still carried . " Nothing , my darling . Vladimir had very kindly offered to drive us to St. Alexander Nevsky tonight . " It was Christmas Eve for them , and Zoya knew every Russian in Paris would be there , but she was n't sure it was wise for her grandmother to go to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . She was n't in the mood for it anyway , but her grandmother looked stern as she straightened her back , and smiled at Vladimir as he returned with the firewood . " Are you sure you feel up to it , Grandmama ? " " Of course . " And what did it matter now ? " I have never missed midnight mass on Christmas in my life . " But they both knew it would be a hard year for them . With so many lost , the servicep146could only remind them of the previous year , when they had celebrated Christmas with their loved ones all around them . And Zoya had been thinking all day of Mashka and the others , spending Christmas in Tobolsk . " I 'll be back at eleven o'clock , " Vladimir promised as he left . Zoya was planning to wear her best dress , and her grandmother had washed and ironed her only decent lace collar to wear on the black dress Zoya had bought her . It was a lonely Christmas Eve in the quiet apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reproach . Evgenia had offered it to Zoya a few days before , but she found that she could n't bring herself to move in . After Feodor , and Antoine , she did n't want the room , and preferred to continue sleeping with her grandmother until they found a new boarder . She cooked the chicken for her that night , roasting it carefully in their tiny oven . It was a luxury not to make soup of it , but it was the only gift they shared , and both of them concentrated desperately on trying not to remember years past in their days of grandeur . They had always stayed at home on Christmas Eve , then gone to church with the family at midnight , and then to Tsarskoe Selo the next day to celebrate there with Nicholas and the others . Now instead , they commented on the chicken , talked about the war , mentioned Vladimir , anything to avoid their own thoughts . When Zoya heard a soft knock on the door , she rose to see who it was , brushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken . " Yes ? " Zoya wondered if it would be the answer to their prayers , and a new boarder was about to appear , directed to them by Vladimir or one of his friends . But it was an odd time to come , and Zoya looked stunned when she heard a familiar voice . . . it could n't be . . . but it was . She pulled the door open , and stood staring at him , as she took him in in his full uniform , his epaulets and his cap shining with his brass insignia , his face serious , but his blue eyes filled with warmth . " Merry Christmas , Zoya . " It was Clayton , standing there . She had n't seen him in four months , but he knew the importance of the date for them , and he had moved heaven and earth to leave Chaumont in time to share it with them . He had a four-day leave , and he wanted to spend it with Zoya . " May I come in ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , as she stared at him in mute amazement  | " I . . . my God . . . is it really you ? " " I believe so . " He smiled , and gently bent to kiss her cheek . Their flirtation of the summer before had gone no further than that , but he longed to take her in his arms now . He had almost forgotten how beautiful she was , as she stood lithe and graceful before him . She followed him inside , gazing happily at his broad shoulders and straight back , and her heart flooded with joy , as he greeted her grandmother , and she noticed that he was carrying a bag , from which he took out incredible treasures for them . There were freshly baked cookies from headquarters , a bar of chocolate , three big fat sausages , a head of fresh lettuce , some apples , and a bottle of wine from General Pershing 's own cellars . They were riches beyond words , beyond anything they 'd seen in months . But Zoya was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expression of adoration . " Merry Christmas , Countess , " he said quietly . " I 've missed you both . " But not half as much as Zoya had missed him . She realized it even more now as he stood before them . " Thank you , Captain . How is the war ? " Evgenia asked quietly , watching her granddaughter , and what she saw warmed her heart , and brightened her all at once . This was the man Zoya had wanted , whether she knew it or not . It was plainly apparent . He was handsome and proud , as he stood virile and tall in their tiny living room , dwarfing everything around him . " Unfortunately , it 's not over yet , but we 're working on it . We should have things in control in a few months , though . " The remains of their dinner sat on the table , looking paltry now , as Zoya glanced hungrily at the chocolates . She laughed as she offered her grandmother one , and then gobbled two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so happy to see her . " I 'll have to remember how much you like those , " he teased , gently taking her hand in his own . " Mmm ? . . . wonderful ! . . . thank you very much . . . " Evgenia laughed , watching her , she seemed so young and happy again as the Captain looked over her head and met the old woman'seyes . She had aged in the past four months , and they both looked thinner to him now , thinner and tired and more worn , but Zoya looked so beautiful to him . He longed to take her in his arms and just hold her.  | " Please sit down , Captain , " Evgenia invited , looking elegant and proud , despite her age and her pains and her constant sacrificesfor Zoya . " Thank you . Are you ladies going to church tonight ? " He knew it was a ritual for them . Zoya had told him all about the candle-lit processions on Christmas Eve , and he wanted to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that night with them , as Zoya nodded emphatically , questioning her grandmother with her eyes . " Would you care to join us , sir ? " Evgenia invited . " I 'd like that very much . " He opened the wine for them , and Zoya got out the glasses he 'd given them the summer before , and silently watched him pour . It was like a dream seeing him standing there in his uniform , like a vision , and she remembered suddenly what she had said to Antoine . She could n't marry a man she did n't love . And she knew she loved this man . She could have married him , no matter how old he was , or where he had been , or what happened to them . . . but they were foolish thoughts . She had n't even heard from him in two months . She had no idea how he felt about her , if he cared about her at all . All she knew was that he was generous and kind , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing more than that . But as Evgenia watched them both , she knew more than that , even more than Clayton knew himself as he stood there . Vladimir arrived shortly after eleven o'clock . He had promised to drive them to church , and he looked startled when he saw Clayton . The Countess introduced the two men , and Vladimirll ! searched his face , wondering who he was and what he was doing there , but the light in Zoya 's eyes told its own tale . It was as though she had survived the past months only to live . for this moment . Clayton followed her to the kitchen briefly as Evgenia poured the Prince some wine , and gently he touched her arm and pulled her slowly toward him . His lips softly touched her silky hair , and his eyes closed as he held her . " I 've missed you terribly , little one . . . . I wanted to write to you , but I could n't . Everything is top secret now . It 's a miracle they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with all of Pershing 's plans for the American Expeditionary Force . He pulled away from her then , and looked down at her with his warm blue eyes . " Did you miss me at all ? "  |p149She  could n't speak , and tears filled her eyes in answer . Everythinghad been so difficult for them , their poverty , the lack of food , the cold winter , the war . It was all a nightmare , and now suddenly here he was , with his cakes , and his wine , and his strong arms held fast around her . " I missed you very much . " She spoke in a hoarse whisper and averted her eyes . She was afraid to even look at him , he would see too much there . But she felt so safe with him , as though she had waited for him for a lifetime . She heard a polite cough then in the kitchen doorway and they both turned . It was Prince Vladimir , watching them with quiet envy . " We should go to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Russian , and for a moment his eyes met Clayton 's . " Will you be coming with us , sir ? The ladies are going to a midnight service . " " I 'd like to very much . " He looked down at Zoya . " Do you think your grandmother would mind ? " " Of course not . " Zoya spoke for them both , especially for herself , as she found herself wondering where he was staying . She thought of offering him Antoine 's room , but suspected correctly that her grandmother would n't think it proper . Not that it matteredanymore . What did propriety mean when you had no food , no money , no warmth , and the world you had lived in was gone ? Who was there to even care about what was proper ? It all seemed so foolish to her now , as Clayton gently took her hand and led her out of the kitchen . Sava followed them closely as they went , lookingup at them , hoping for a scrap of food . She quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her grandmother went to get her hat and coat , and she took her own worn coat from a peg near the door , as the two men waited , chatting politely about the war , the weather , and the prospects for peace in the coming months . Vladimir seemed to be looking him over critically , but in spite of himself he could n't dislike him . The American was too old for Zoya , of course , and Evgenia would be foolish if she let anything happen between them . When the war was over , he would go back to New York and forget the pretty girl he had toyed with in Paris . But Vladimir could n't blame him for wanting her , of course . He still longed for her himself , although he had been courting one of his daughter 's friends for over a month now . She was a hearty Russian girl from a good family , who had come to Paris the previous spring , like the rest of them , and wasp150eking out a small living by taking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church . Clayton helped the old Countess downstairs , as Zoya watched , and Vladimir led the way to his waiting taxi . And they drove slowly through the quiet streets , as Clayton looked around him and especiallyat Zoya . She looked as though she needed some fun , and some good meals . She needed a new coat , too , her old one looked almost threadbare as the wind whistled past them in front of St. Alexander Nevsky . It was a beautiful old church , and there were crowds of people already inside when they got there . They could hear the organ music from the front steps as they went in , and all around them was the soft hubbub of voices . The incense smelled sweet , and it was warm inside , and suddenly tears filled Zoya 's eyes as she looked around her at the familiar faces , and heard the sounds of everyone speaking Russian . It was almost like going home again , their faces alive and warm as they each held a tall candle . Vladimir handed one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a little boy . He looked up at her with a shy smile and wished her a Merry Christmas . And all she could think of now were other Christmases , other days . . . Mashka and Olga and Tatiana and Anastasia . . . Aunt Alix and Uncle Nicky . . . and tiny Alexis . .. they went to Easter services together each year , much like these . . . and as she fought back the memories , Clayton gently took her hand and held it , as though he could look into her mind and feel what she saw there . He put an arm around her as they sang the first hymn , and he was overwhelmed by the beauty of their powerful voices lifted in Russian . Tears rolled slowly down the men 's cheeks , and many of the women cried , as they remembered the life they had shared in a place they would always remember . It was almost more than Zoya could bear , the smells and the sounds and the feelings were so agonizingly familiar . With her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother and father . It was almost like being a child again as she stood close to Clayton , and tried to pretend they were still in Russia . And after the service , countless people they knew approached them . The men bowed and kissed Evgenia 's hand , the ones who had been servants knelt briefly at her feet , and people cried openly and embraced , as Clayton watched them . Zoya introducedp151him to as many as she knew . There were so many faces that looked familiar to her , although she did n't know them all . But they seemed to know her and Evgenia . Grand Duke Cyril was there , and some other cousins of the Romanovs too , all wearing old clothes , worn-out shoes , and faces that scarcely concealed their troubles . It was painful just being there , and yet it was heartwarmingtoo , like a brief trip into a past they all wanted to retrieve and would spend a lifetime reliving . Evgenia looked exhausted as she stood beside Vladimir . She stood tall and proud and greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible moment when Grand Duke Cyril came to her and sobbed like a child . Neither of them could speak , and Evgenia touched him in silent blessing . Zoya gently took her arm then , and with a look at Vladimir , led her quietly outside to his taxi . It had been a hard night for all of them , but it meant a great deal to them just to be there . And she settled back against the seat with a tired sigh and eyes that spoke volumes . " It was a beautiful service . " Clayton spoke quietly , moved beyondwords . One could sense their love , their pride , their faith , and their sorrow . And it was almost as though , in silent unison , they had been praying for their Tsar , and his wife and children . Clayton wondered if Zoya had heard from Marie again , but he did n't want to ask her in front of Evgenia . It was all much too painful . " Thank you for letting me come . " Clayton escorted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vladimir poured the last of the wine . Seeing Evgenia 's sad eyes and worn face , Clayton was sorry he had n't brought them brandy . He stoked the fire again , and absentmindedlypatted Sava , as Zoya quietly munched another cookie . " You should go to bed , Grandmama . " " I will in a minute . " She wanted to sit there for a moment and remember , and then she looked tenderly at all of them . " Merry Christmas , children . God 's blessings on us all . " She took a sip of wine then and slowly stood up . " I will leave you now . I 'm very tired . " Clayton saw that she could hardly walk as Zoya helped her to their room , and returned a few minutes later . Vladimir left shortly after that , with a last look of envy at Clayton . But he smiled at him . He was a lucky man to have Zoya look at him the way she did . She was so young and so alive and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were sad , still touched by the midnight service . " Merry Christmas to you , Prince Vladimir . " He kissed her cheeks and hurried back down the stairs to his taxi . His daughter and her friend were waiting for him at home . And as the door closed , Zoya turned quietly to Clayton . It was all so bittersweet , the old and the new , the happy and the sad . The memories and the real . . . Konstantin , Nicolai . . . Vladimir . . . Feodor .. . Antoine . . . and now Clayton . . . . As she looked at him , she remembered them all , and her hair shone like gold in the light from the fire . He walked quietly to her and took her hands in his own , and without a word he took her in his arms and kissed her . " Merry Christmas . " He said it in Russian , as he had heard again and again at St. Alexander Nevsky . She repeated it back to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gently stroked her hair , and listened to the fire crackle as Sava slept beside them . " I love you . . . Zoya . . . " He had n't wanted to say it to her yet , he had wanted to be sure , and yet he was . He had known it since September when he left her . " I love you too . " She whispered the words that were so easy to say to him . " Oh , Clayton . . . I love you . . . " But then what , there was the war , and eventually he would have to leave Paris and go back to New York . She would n't let herself think of it now . She just could n't . He pulled her gently onto the couch , and they sat holding hands , like two happy children . " I 've worried about you so much . I wish I could have stayed here for all these months . " And now they only had four days , a tiny island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any moment . " I knew you 'd come back . " She smiled . " At least I hoped so . " And she was more than ever grateful that she had n't allowed her grandmother to force her to marry Antoine . If she had listened , she might have been married to him , or even Vladimir , by the time Clayton returned to see her . " I tried to fight this , you know . " He sighed and stretched his long legs out on the ugly purple rug . It had grown even more threadbare in the past months . Everything in the apartment looked dingy and old and shabby , except the beautiful girl at his side , with the green eyes and red hair , the sharply etched face likep153a perfect cameo , the face he had dreamed of for months , in spite of all the reasons he gave himself to forget her . " I 'm too old for you , Zoya . You need someone young , to discover life with you , and make you happy . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a boy who had as little as she did ? The truth was that she needed someone to take care of her , and he wanted to be the one to do it . " You make me happy , Clayton . Happier than I 've ever been . . . " she smiled honestly , " in a long , long time anyway . " She turned to him with serious eyes , " I do n't want anyone younger . It does n't matter how old or young you are . It only matters what we feel . I would n't care if you were rich or poor , or a hundred years old , or ten . If you love someone , none of those things should matter . " " But sometimes they do , little one . " He was older and wiser than she was . " This is a strange time , you have lost everything , and you 're trapped here , in a war , in a strange land . We 're both strangershere . . . but later , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask yourself what am I doing with him ? " He smiled at her , afraid it might happen just as he predicted . " War does funny things . " He had seen it happen to others . " For me , this war is forever . I ca n't go home again . Oh . . . some of them think we will go back one day . . . but now there has been another revolution . Everything will always be different . And we 're here now . This is our life now , this is real . . . " She looked at him seriously , suddenly no longer a child no matter how young she was in actual years . " All I know is how much I love you . " " You make me feel so young , little Zoya . " He held her close again , as she felt his warmth and his strength , all the good things she had felt long before when her father held her . " You make me so very happy . " This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his arms and had to fight his own passion for her . He had dreamed of her for far too long , ached for her , needed her , and now he could barely fight his own feelings and desire . He stood up and went to look out the window into the garden , and then slowly he turned to her , wondering which path their lives would take now . He had come back to Paris to see her , and yet suddenly he was afraid of what might happen . Only Zoya seemed sure and calm , certain that she was doing the right thing being there with him . Her eyes were peaceful as she looked at him . " Ip154do n't want to do anything you 'll regret , little one . " And then , " Are you dancing this week ? " She shook her head and he smiled . " Good , then we 'll have time before I have to go back to Chaumont . I suppose I should leave you now . " It was three o'clock in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door and Sava followed . " Where are you staying ? " " The General very kindly let me use Ogden Mills 's house this time . " It was where they had met , the beautiful hotel particulier on the rue de Varennes , on the Left Bank , where they had walked in the garden the night of the reception for the Ballet Busse . " May I come to get you tomorrow morning ? " She nodded happily . " I 'd like that . " " I 'll come at ten . " He kissed her again in the doorway , uncertain of where they were going , but aware to his very core that there was no turning back now . " Good night , Captain , " she teased , her eyes dancing as they never had before . " Good night , my love , " she called softly as he hurried down the stairs on feet that wanted to dance . He could n't help smiling to himself , thinking that never in his life had he been this happy.  |p155You  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her grandmother spoke quietly over breakfast . Zoya had sliced some of the apples for her , and made a precious piece of toast from the bread that Clayton had brought them . " Not very . " She averted her eyes as she sipped at her tea , and then stealthily gobbled a chocolate . " You 're still a child , little one . " Her grandmother said it almost sadly as she watched her . She knew what was coming and she was afraid for her . He was a good man , but it was not a desirable situation . Vladimir had said as much to her the night before and she could n't disagree with him , but she also knew that she could n't stop Zoya . Perhaps the Captain would be wiser than the child , but having come all the way from Chaumont to see her , she thought it unlikely . And it was obvious to everyone who saw him , that he was desperately in love with Zoya . " I 'm eighteen , Grandmama . " " And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It means that I 'm not as silly as you think . "  | " You 're silly enough to fall in love with a man old enough to be your father . A man who is in a foreign land , with an army at war , a man who will go home someday and leave you here . You must think of that before you do anything foolish . " " I 'm not going to do anything foolish . " " See that you do n't . " But she was already in love with him , and that was enough to cause her pain when he left . And he would leave , when the war was over , if not sooner . " He wo n't marry you . You must know that . " " I do n't want to marry him anyway . " But that was a lie , and they both knew it . When Clayton arrived at the apartment shortly after breakfast , he saw the guarded look in the old woman 's eyes . He brought her flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bread . " I shall grow fat while you visit us , Captain . " She smiled graciouslyat him . He was a charming man . But she was still very much afraid for Zoya . " There 's no danger of that , madame . Would you like to take a walk in the Tuileries with us ? " " I would . " She smiled , almost feeling young again herself . He seemed to bring sunlight and happiness with him everywhere , with his thoughtful gifts and gentle ways , so much like her own son , with his warm eyes and quick laughter . " But I 'm afraid that my knees wo n't agree . I seem to have a touch of rheumatism this winter . " The " touch " she referred to would have crippled a lesser woman . Only Zoya suspected how much pain she was in . " Will you allow me to take Zoya for a walk then ? " He was proper and well bred , and she liked him immensely . " You 're very kind to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be any stopping Zoya . " They both laughed while Zoya went to get her things with a happy blush that outshone her worn clothes , and tired dresses . For the first time in months , she longed for something pretty to wear again . She had had so many lovely dresses in St. Petersburg , all of them burned and gone now , but not yet forgotten . Zoya kissed her grandmother good-bye , and the old woman watched them go , feeling happy for them , as Clayton took Zoya 's hand . One could n't feel anything less for them . They seemed to light up the room with their excitement . Zoya was chatting happilyas they left , and she could hear them as they hurried down thep157stairs . He had one of the staff cars outside , that had been commandeeredfor the army . " Well , where would you like to go ? " He smiled at her from behind the wheel . " I 'm entirely at your service . " And she was free too . There were no rehearsals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Clayton . " Let 's go to the Faubourg St. Honore . I want to look in all the shops . I never have time to do things like that , and besides there is n't much point anyway . " She told him , as they drove , how much she and Mashka had loved clothes , and how beautiful Aunt Alix 's dresses had been . " My mother was always beautifully dressed too . But she was never a very happy person . " It was an odd thing to admit to him , but it seemed so natural to tell him everything , she wanted to share her every thought , every wish , every dream , every memory , so he would know her better . " Mama was very nervous . Grandmama says Papa spoiled her . " Zoya suddenly giggled , feeling young again . " You should be spoiled too . Maybe you will one day , just like your mother . " She laughed openly at him as they parked the car and got out to walk . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed back at her , and tucked her hand into his arm as they strolled along , and the hours seemed to fly past them like moments . They had lunch at the Cafe de Flore , and he thought she seemed happier than she had been the previous summer . She was still in shock then , but now at least some of the pain had dimmed . It had been nine months since she 'd come to Paris . It was still hard to believe that only a year before she had been in St. Petersburg and life was still normal . " Have you heard from Marie lately ? " " Yes , finally . She seems to like it in Tobolsk , but she 's such a good sport , she would . She said the house she lives in is tiny , she and her sisters all share one room , and Uncle Nicky reads history to them all the time . She says that even in Siberia , they 're still having lessons . They think they might be able to come out of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , they just want to keep them there for the time being . But it seems so cruel of them , and so stupid . " And Zoya was still furious at the English for not granting them asylum the previous March . If they had , they could all have been together by then , in London or Paris.  | " I 'm sure Grandmama would have gone to London , if they were there . " " Then I would n't have met you , would I ? And that would have been terrible . Maybe it 's just as well you had to come to Paris , while you wait for them to leave Russia . " He did n't want to alarm her , but he had never felt as confident as some that the Tsar and his family would ultimately be safe in Russia . But it was only a feeling he had , and he did n't want to say anything to worry her as they finished lunch and walked down the Boulevard St. Germain in the winter sunshine . Lunch at the Cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she had nothing but free time on her hands , with no performances and no rehearsals . They wandered aimlessly for a while , and eventually wound up at the rue de Varennes , as they both realized they were near the house where he was staying . " Do you want to come to the house for a while ? " She still had happy memories of it from the night they 'd met , and she nodded happily as they walked along . He told her about New York , his boyhood , and his years at Princeton . He said he lived in a house , on Fifth Avenue , and she thought it sounded very pretty . " Why did you never have children when you were married ? Did n't you want them ? " She had the innocence of youth , the fearlessness about treading on delicate ground that one suppressedwhen one was older . It never occurred to her that perhaps he could n't have them . " I would have liked to have children , but my wife did n't want them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was far more interested in her horses . She has a beautiful farm in Virginia now , and she has a hunt there . Did you ride much when you were in Russia ? " " Yes , " she smiled , " in the summer at Livadia , and sometimes at Tsarskoe Selo . My brother taught me to ride when I was four . He was dreadfully mean about it , and whenever I fell off he said I was stupid . " But Clayton could tell just from the way she spoke how much she had loved him . They had reached the Mills house by then , and Clayton used his key to let them in . There was no one else staying there at the time . Ail of the General 's staff were in Chaumont . " Would you like a cup of tea ? " he asked , as their footsteps echoed in the marble halls.  | " I 'd like that . " It was cold outside , and she had forgotten her gloves at the apartment . And suddenly , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had left in Russia . They had worn heavy shawls over their heads while they were escaping . Her grandmother had wisely thought that elaborate fur hats would catch too much attention . She followed him into the kitchen , and a moment later the kettle was steaming . He poured out two cups of tea and they sat and talked , as the sun set quietly over the garden . She felt as though she could have sat and talked to him for hours , but suddenlytheir voices grew quiet , and she sensed Clayton watching her strangely . " I should take you home . Your grandmother will be worried . " It was after four o'clock and they 'd been gone all day , but Zoya had wisely warned her grandmother that she might not be home for dinner . With only four days of his leave to share , they wanted to spend every moment possible together . " I told her we might not come back till later . " And then she had a thought . " Do you want me to make dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to go out , they could sit and talk for several more hours as they had done all day . " Is there any food here ? " " I do n't know , " he smiled . She looked so young and beautiful as she sat there . " I should take you somewhere . Maybe Maxim 's . Would n't you like that ? " " It does n't matter , " she said honestly . She just wanted to be with him . " Oh , Zoya . . . " He came around the kitchen table to hold her close to him . He wanted to get her out of the house before somethinghappened that she 'd regret . The pull of her was so great , it was almost painful . " I do n't think we should stay here , " he said quietly , far wiser than she was . " Would the General be angry that I 'm here ? " Her innocence touched his heart , as he looked down at her and laughed softly . " No , my love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure I can control myself for much longer . You 're far too beautiful for me to be trusted with you alone . You do n't know how lucky you are that I have n't just leapt across the table and grabbed you . " She laughed at the picture he painted and leaned her head happily against him . " Is that what you 've been planning to do , Captain ? "  | " No . But I 'd like to . " They were both perfectly relaxed as he stroked her long red hair . " I 'd like to do a lot of things with you ... go to the south of France after the war . . . and Italy .. . have you ever been there ? " She shook her head and closed her eyes . It was all so dreamlike just being with him . " I think we should go , " he repeated softly , and the room seemed very still . " I 'll go change . I wo n't be a minute . " But he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant rooms on the main floor , and then suddenly , feeling mischievous , she decided to wander up the marble staircase and see if she could find him . There were several more sitting rooms on the second floor , a handsome library filled with books in both French and English , several closed doors , and then in the distance she heard him . He was singing to himself as he changed , and she smiled , unable to keep away from him , even for a few minutes . " Hello ? . . . " she called out , but he did n't hear her , there was water running in the bathroom , and when he went back to the bedroom she was standing there , like a fawn standing very still in the forest . He was wearing his trousers and his chest was bare . He had decided to shave again quickly before taking her out to dinner . He had a towel in his hands and his face was still damp , as he looked at her in sudden amazement . " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of himself , but not of lovely Zoya . " I was lonely downstairs without you . " She walked slowly towardhim , feeling a magnetic force she had never felt before . It was as though without any will of her own , she was irreversibly pulled to him . He dropped the towel at his feet and pulled her close to him , kissing her face and her eyes and her lips , tasting the sweetness of her skin until it made him dizzy . " Go downstairs , Zoya . " His voice was hoarse and he wanted to pull her away but he could n't make himself do it . " Please .... " She looked up at him so sadly , almost hurt , but not afraid . " I do n't want to . .. " " Zoya , please . . . " But he only kissed her again and again , as he felt her heart next to his chest beating wildly . " Clayton , I love you .... " " I love you too . " And finally , painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have come up here , silly girl . " He tried top161make light of it as he pulled away , and turned to get a shirt out of the closet , but when he turned , she was still standing there , and the shirt dropped from his hands as he came toward her . " I ca n't stand this for much longer , little one . " She was driving him mad with her youth and her sensual beauty . " Zoya , I would never forgive myself if . . . " If what ? " The girl was gone , and she stood before him , fully a woman . " If you loved me ? What difference does it make , Clayton ? There is no future anymore . . . there is only now . There is no tomorrow . " It was the hardest lesson she had learned in the past year . And she knew how much she loved him . " I love you . " She was so small and proud and strong , it tore at his heart seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fear him , she only loved him . " You do n't know what you 're doing . " He had his arms around her again and was cradling her like a child . " I do n't want to hurt you . " " You could n't . . . I love you too much . . . you will never hurt me . " And then he could no longer find the words to convince her to go away . He wanted her too much , had ached for her for too long . His mouth overcame hers , and without thinking he let his hands peel away her clothes and he gently carried her to the bed and held her and stroked her and kissed her as she kissed him and wept softly . His own clothes seemed to come away from him , and they slipped into the enormous bed with the canopy hanging over them like a blessing . It was dark in the room as they made love , but in the light from the bathroom beyond he could see her face as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loving her as he had never loved any woman before her . It seemed hours before they lay silent side by side , and she sighed happily as she nestled close to him like a tiny animal seekingits mother . His eyes were serious then and he was thinking of what they had done , praying that she would n't get pregnant . He rolled over on his side and rested on one elbow as he looked at her . " I do n't know if I should be furious with myself , or just let myself be as happy as I feel right now . Zoya . . . darling , are you sorry ? " He was terrified of that , but she smiled a womanly smile , and reached her arms out to him , as he felt desire for her flood him again . They lay in bed and talked and made love until almostp162midnight , when he glanced at the clock on the bed table with sudden horror . " Oh my God , Zoya ! Your grandmother will kill me ! " She laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out with him . " Get dressed . . . and I did n't even feed you ! " " I did n't notice . " She was giggling like a schoolgirl and suddenly he turned and put his arms around her again . " I love you , you crazy girl . Do you know that ? Old as I am , I happen to adore you . " " Good . Because I love you too , and you 're not old , you 're mine ! " She pulled his silver hair gently and brought his face close to hers . " Remember that , no matter what happens to either of us , remember how much I love you ! " It was a lesson she had learned early in life , that one never knew what grief could come on the morrow . The thought of it touched him deeply and he held her tightly . " Nothing is going to happen , little one , you 're safe now . " He ran a bath for her in the enormous tub , and the sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , she could tell herself that she was back in the Fontanka Palace , but as she dressed in her ugly gray wool dress again and slipped on her worn black shoes , she knew she was n't . She wore black wool stockings to keep her legs warm , and when she saw herself in the mirror , she looked like an orphan . " My God , I look awful , Clayton . How can you love me like this ? " " You 're beautiful , silly one . Every inch of you , every bright red hair . . . everything about you , " he whispered into her hair , and it was like breathing summer flowers . " I adore you . " They could hardly force themselves to leave , but he knew he had to take her home to the apartment at the Palais Royal . There was no way at all she could stay out with him all night , and as he followed her up the stairs to the fourth floor , he kissed her one last time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door with her key , as they saw Evgenia asleep in a chair , waiting for them . Their eyes met for a last time , as Zoya bent to kiss her cheek gently . " Grandmama ? . . . I 'm sorry I 'm late , you should n't have waited up . .. . The old woman stirred and smiled up at them both , even in her half sleep she could see how happy they both were . It was like a breath of spring in the ugly room , and she found that she could n't be angry.  | " I wanted to be sure you were all right . Did you have a nice time ? " She looked at them both , searching Clayton 's eyes , but all she saw there was kindness and his love for Zoya . " We had a lovely time , " Zoya answered without guilt . She belonged to him now , and nothing could change that . " Did you have dinner ? " " I had some of yesterday 's chicken , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to him as she struggled to stand up , " it was lovely , Captain . " He was embarrassed not to have brought her more , but he had been in a hurry that morning . And he realized again suddenly that he had never fed Zoya that night , and wondered if she was as hungry as he was . They had been distracted for long , happy hours but now he was starving . And as though she read his mind , she glanced at him with an illconcealedsmile and handed him the chocolates . He swallowed one guiltily and put one in her mouth as she smiled and then went to help her grandmother into their bedroom . She came back for a moment afterward and they kissed again . He hated to leave her and go home , but he knew he had to . " I love you , " she whispered happily before he left . " Only half as much as I love you , " he whispered back . " How can you say that ? " " Because I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly closed the door behind him , as Zoya stood there , young again and happy and free , as she quietly turned off the lights in the apartment.  |p164Clayton  returned the next morning looking impeccably groomed , and carrying an enormous basket of food for them . This time he had taken the time to go shopping . " Good morning ladies ! " He seemed in exceptionally good humor , Evgenia noticed with a worried glance , but she knew that there was nothing she could do to stop them . He had brought meat and fruit , and two different kinds of cheese , cookies , and more chocolates for Zoya . He kissed her lightly on the cheek and squeezed her hand , and insisted that the Countess come out for a drive with them . They drove happily through the Bois de Boulogne , talking and laughing , and even Evgenia felt young again just being with them . Clayton took her out to lunch with them , to the Closerie des Lilas this time , and then they took her home . She was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , and Clayton half carried her , as she smiled gratefully at him . She had had a wonderful time , and for a little while , their poverty and the war and their sorrows were forgotten.  |p165They  sat drinking tea in the living room for a long time , and then Zoya went out with Clayton again . They went back to the Mills house on the rue de Varennes , and they made passionate love for hours . But this time , he insisted on taking her out to dinner . He took her to Maxim 's and then regretfully home , and Evgenia was asleep in bed when they got there . The two lovers tiptoed soundlesslyaround the living room , eating chocolates and whispering , as they kissed in the firelight , and shared their dreams with each other . She wished she could stay with him all night , but there was no way imaginable that she could do that , and when he left , feeling like a boy again , he promised to return in the morning . The next day he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by eleven o'clock , Zoya was getting worried . They had no phone , so she could n't call , but at eleven-thirty he appeared , struggling with an enormous bundle wrapped in brown paper . He set it heavily on the kitchen table with a look of mysterious delight and told Zoya it was for her grandmother . The old Countess came to join them then , and he stood back as he watched her pull the paper off to reveal an extraordinarily beautiful silver samovar , engraved with the crest of the Russian family that had brought it to Paris and been forced to sell it . He could n't even imagine how they 'd gotten it there , but when he 'd seen it that morning in a shop on the Left Bank , he had known instantly that he had to buy it for Evgenia . She caught her breath as she stood back , staring at it , in wonder , and for a moment she felt a sharp pain of sadness , knowing how dear her own treasures had been and how much it hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieving over the cigarette cases she had been forced to sell just before Christmas . But now she could only stare at the samovar and at the kind benefactor who had brought it to them . " Captain . . . you are far too good to us . . . " Tears filled her eyes , and she gently kissed him , the faded satin of her cheek touching his male flesh , reminding her of her own son , and her husband . " You are so very kind . " " I only wish I could do more . " He had brought Zoya a white silk dress , and her eyes opened wide with amazed delight as she peeled away the wrappings . It was designed by a little dressmaker he had found on the Left Bank , a woman named Gabrielle Chanel.  |p166She  had a small shop , and she seemed amazingly gifted . She had showed the dress to him herself and she seemed lively and amusing , which was unusual these days for the war-worn people of Paris . " Do you like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and emerged looking absolutely splendid . The dress looked pure and simple , and the creamy white set off the fire of her hair wonderfully . She only wished she had pretty shoes to wear with it , and the pearl necklace Papa had given her that had burned with Fontanka . " I love it , Clayton ! " She wore it to lunch with him that day , and it lay on his bedroom floor later that afternoon . The next day was his last , he was leaving at four o'clock that afternoon , and she could n't bear the thought of it as they made love for the last time , and she clung to him like a drowning child , as he kissed her . When he took her back to the apartment , even Evgenia looked sad to see him go . The farewells in their lives had already been far too painful . " Be careful , Captain . . . we will pray for you each day , " as they did now for so many others . She thanked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to linger , not wanting to go , unable to leave Zoya for a moment , let alone for months . He had no idea when he would be able to get back to Paris . Evgenia left them discreetly alone , as tears filled Zoya 's eyes and she looked at him in the tiny living room , the silver samovar dwarfing everything in sight , but she saw only him as she flew into his arms with a sob , and he held her to him . " I love you so much , little one . . . please , please be careful . " He knew how potentially dangerous it was for her in Paris . There was still a possibility that Paris could be attacked , and he prayed for her safety as he held her . " I 'll come back the minute I can . " " Swear to me you 'll be careful . Swear ! " she commanded through her tears , she could n't bear the thought of losing anyone else she loved , and not someone as dear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't regret what we 've done . " He still worried about that and he was still desperately afraid she might have gotten pregnant the first time they made love . He 'd been careful after that , but not careful enough the first time . She 'd taken him too much by surprise and his own desire for her had been too overwhelming.  | " I will never regret anything . I love you too much . " She followed him down the stairs to his car , and stood waving until he was out of sight , the tears rolling down her cheeks as she watched him disappear , perhaps forever.  |p168Contrary  to what he promised her , she did not hear from him again . Their strategies and maneuvers were too top secret now , and they were virtually cut off from everyone as they sat by the Marne , trying to protect Paris . In March , the last great German offensive began , as they sat waiting to pounce just outside the city . There was shelling in the streets , and Evgenia was afraid to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shells at the Madeleine . And everywhere , people were hungry and cold and frightened . Diaghilev gave Zoya an opportunity to escape . On March 3 , he left for another tour in Spain with the ballet , but Zoya insisted she could n't leave Evgenia alone in Paris . Instead she stayed in Paris , but most of their performances were curtailed . It was almost too dangerous to move through the streets now . And only by a miracle did she manage to survive the destruction of the church of St.-Gervais-St. - Protais near the Hotel de Ville on Good Friday . She had decided to go there instead of St. Alexander Nevsky , and she left only moments before shells hit the roof and it collapsed , killing seventy-five souls and wounding nearly a hundred.  |p169Trains  for Lyon and the south were filled with people panicking , fleeing Paris . But when Zoya suggested to her grandmother that they leave , the old woman became enraged . " And just how many times do you think I will do this ? No ! No , Zoya ! Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have run all the way from Russia , and I will not run anymore ! " It was the first time Zoya had seen her cry in helpless rage . It was almost exactly a year since they had left everything behind them and fled Russia . And this time there was no Feodor , there was nothing left to sell , there was nowhere to go . It was totally hopeless . The French government itself was preparing to flee , if necessary . They had made plans to move to Bordeaux , but Foch himself had vowed to defend Paris till the end , in the streets , and on the rooftops . All of Zoya 's performances and rehearsals were canceled in May . And by then , the Allies were losing on the Marne . With Pershing there , all Zoya could think of was Clayton . She was terrifiedhe would be killed , and she had had no news of him since he left Paris . The only news she had was a letter from Marie that Dr. Botkin had managed to send to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Ekaterinburg in the Urals from Tobolsk the month before . And she could tell from what Marie said that things had gotten much harder . They were no longer allowed to lock their doors , and the soldiers even followed them to the bathroom . Zoya shuddered to herself as she read the words , aching for her childhood friend , and especially Tatiana , who was so prim and shy . The thought of them in such grim circumstances was almost beyond bearing . " ... There is nothing but for us to endure it here . Mama makes us sing hymns whenever the soldiers chant their awful songs just downstairs . They are very harsh with us now . Papa says we must do nothing to make them angry . They allow us out for a little while in the afternoon , and the rest of the time we read , or do needlework . . . " Zoya 's eyes spilled tears onto her cheeks at the next words , " . . . and you know how I hate sewing , darling Zoya . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall show it all to you when we are finally together again . It seems hard to imagine that we are both nineteen now . I used to think nineteen was so old , but now it seems too young to die . Only to you , can I say things like that , beloved cousin and friend . I pray that you are happy and safe inp170Paris . I must go for our exercise now . We all send you our love , and please give ours to Aunt Evgenia . " She had signed it not with OTMA this time , their familiar code , but simply " your loving Mashka . " Zoya sat in her room for a long time and cried , reading the words over and over again , touching the letter to her cheek , as though touching her paper would bring her friend 's touch back to her again . She suddenly feared terribly for them . Everything seemed to be getting worse everywhere , but at least the ballet in which she danced went back to work in June . She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never found another boarder . People were leaving Paris , not coming to it anymore . Even some of the Russian emigres had gone south , but Evgenia still refused to leave . She had gone as far as she was going to . By mid-July , the city was warm , but still hungry . Zoya was horrifiedto hear from Vladimir that he and Yelena had been catching pigeons in the park , to eat them . He pronounced them surprisinglytasty and offered to bring them one , but Zoya declined , feeling ill at the thought . And two days afterward , as she began to despair that the war would ever end , Clayton reappeared like a vision in a dream . Zoya almost fainted when she first saw him . It was on the eve of Bastille Day and together they watched the parades from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde , the uniforms looked incredibly beautiful in the bright sun , the Chasseurs Alpins in their berets and black tunics , the British Life Guards , the Italian Bersaglieri in rooster-tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but all she really saw that day was Clayton . When they returned to the house on the rue de Varennes , as deeply in love as ever , there was a fierce pounding on the door at midnight . The M.P . ' s were rounding everyone up , all leaves were canceled , the German offensive had begun in earnest . German troops were only fifty miles away and the Allies had to stop them . " But you ca n't go now . . . " Zoya cried . Tears filled her eyes in spite of her attempts to be brave . " You just got here ! " He had only arrived that morning , and after six months without him , she could n't bear to see him go so soon . But there was no choice . He had half an hour to report to the headquarters of the military police on the rue St. Anne . He barely had time to take her home , before they escorted him back to General Pershing . But to Zoya , itp171seemed cruel beyond words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front to risk his life again . And like a small child abandoned , she sat in her living room and cried late that night , as her grandmother brought her a cup of tea to console her . But the tears she shed for Clayton were nothing to the tears she shed a few days later . On the twentieth of July , Vladimir appeared at the apartment with a solemn face , and a copy of Izvestia , the Russian newspaper . Zoya sensed instantly when she opened the door that something terrible had happened , and she felt almost ill as she escorted him inside and assisted her grandmother from the bedroom . He began to cry as he held the newspaper out to her . He looked like a heartbroken child , his white hair almost the same color as his face , and repeating the same words again and again . " . . . They have killed him . . . oh my God . . . they 've killed him . . . " He had come directly to them , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romanov cousins . " What do you mean ? " Evgenia looked at him with horror , and rose halfway in her chair , as he showed her the notice in the paper . On the sixteenth of July , the Tsar Nicholas had been executed , it said . He had been shot . And it said that his family had been moved to safety . Moved to where ? Zoya wanted to scream . . . where is my beloved Mashka ? . . . where are they ? . . . almost as though she knew , Sava began to keen softly , as the three Russians sat and cried for the man who had been their father , their Tsar . . . and was the two women 's much loved cousin . There were the sounds of sorrow in the room for a long time , and at last Vladimir stood and walked to the window , his head bowed , his heart heavy almost beyond bearing . All over the world the Russians who had loved him would be crying , even the peasantsin whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible , terrible day , " he said softly . " God rest his soul , " he whispered , and turned to the women . Evgenia looked a hundred years old , and Zoya was deathly pale , the only color in her face the fierce green eyes , red-rimmed with tears , which still fell silently down her cheeks . All she could think of was that last morning in Tsarskoe Selo when he had kissed her good-bye and told her to be good . . . " I love you , Uncle Nicky , " her own wordsp172echoed in her head . . . and then he had told her he loved her too . And now he was dead . Gone forever . And the others ? . . she read the words in Izvestia again . . . " The family has been moved to safety . "  |p173July  seemed to drag by like a nightmare . The fact that Nicholas had been killed seemed to weigh on them like an unbearable burden . Their gloom never seemed to lift anymore . All over Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waged on around them . Zoya was invited to a wedding celebration for one of the ballerinasshe knew . Her name was Olga Khokhlova and she had married Pablo Picasso a few weeks before at St. Alexander Nevsky , but Zoya had no desire to go anywhere now . She wore the few black dresses she had , and was in deepest mourning for her cousin . In August , Diaghilev cabled her once again , this time with an offer to join his troupe for a tour in London , but she still could n't leave her grandmother , and she did n't want to see anyone . She could barely make herself go to work , which she did each day , just so they could put food on their table . And in September , the Allies pressed ahead once more , and within a few weeks , the Germans were attempting to negotiate peace with them . But there was still no news of Clayton . Zoyap174barely dared to think of him now . If something happened to him too , she knew she could n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too much to think about , impossible to understand . Uncle Nicky was dead . The words rang again and again in her head . She had written three letters to Marie since she heard the news , but as yet there had been no answer . She was no longer clear about where Dr. Botkin was , and if the family had been moved , as the newspaperhad said , it was impossible to say how long it would take for the letters to reach her . But finally , after an endless October of silence from those she loved , November came , and with it peace at last . They sat in their living room when they heard the news , listening to the shouting in the streets , the screams , the jubilation , the church bells , the cannons . It had finally come to an end . The whole world had shuddered from the blow of it , but now , at last , it was finished . The great war was over . She quietly poured her grandmother a cup of tea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street from the window . There were Allied troops everywhere , Americans , English , Italians , French , but she did n't even know if Clayton was still alive , and she hardly dared to hope . She turned to look at Evgenia , so old now , so frail , the cough that had plagued her the previous winter had returned , and her knees were so bad she could no longer leave the apartment . " Things will be better now , little Zoya , " she said softly , but she was racked by coughs as she said it . She knew what was on the girl 's mind . She had n't heard from Clayton since he left Paris at midnight on Bastille Day . " He 'll come home to you , little one . Trust a little bit . You must have faith . " She smiled at her gently , but there was no joy in Zoya 's eyes anymore . She had lost too much . And she was worried about too many . " How can you still say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe anyone will come home again ? " " The world goes on . People are born , and die , and others are born after them . It is only our own sadness that is so painful . Nicholas knows no pain now . He is at peace . " " And the others ? " She had now written five letters to Marie , and all of them were still unanswered . " We can only pray for their safety . " Zoya nodded . She had heardp175it all before . She was angry now at the fates that had taken so much from them . It was almost impossible to get through the streets during those first days after the armistice , and she only went out to bring back food for them . Once again , their supplies had dwindled to almost nothing . There were no performances of the ballet , and they had to get by on the tiny sum she had saved . It suddenly all seemed so exhausting . " May I help you carry that , mademoiselle ? " She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned with angry words on the tip of her tongue , ready to kill for the food she had , or to defend herself against an amorous soldier . Not everyone in Paris wanted to be kissed by an excited boy in uniform , she thought to herself as she swung around , her hands in fists , and gasped as she dropped the prized baguette and he pulled her to him . " Oh . . . oh . . . " Tears sprang to her eyes instantly as she melted into his arms with relief . He was alive . . . oh , God .. . he was alive . . . it was as though they were the only two people left ... the only survivors of a lost world , as she clung passionatelyto Clayton . " Now that 's better ! " He looked down at her from his great height , his field uniform stained and wrinkled , his face rough from the beard stubble he had n't been able to shave in days . He had just arrived in Paris and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evgenia , and she had told him Zoya was out buying some food and he had rushed back down the stairs to meet her in the street . " Are you all right ? " She was laughing and crying all at once and he kissed her again and again , as relieved as she was that they had both survived . It seemed miraculous now , in the face of everything , and he did n't tell her how close he had come more than once to being killed on the Marne . It did n't matter now . He was alive , and she was safe , and he silently thanked whatever guardian angels they had as they made their way through the crowds back to the apartment . He was billeted in a small hotel on the Left Bank this time , along with dozens of other officers . Pershing was back in the Mills house himself , and it was difficult for them to be alone anywhere , but they stole what private moments they could , and one night theyp176even dared to make love quietly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . She was so tired now , and she slept so much of the time . Zoya had been worried about her for months , but even those fears seemed to dim in the light of being reunited with Clayton . They talked about Nicholas late one night , and he admitted to her that he had always feared it might come to that . And she shared her fears with him about the others . " The Russian newspaper said they had been moved to safety ... but where ? I 've written to Mashka five times , and I still have no answer . " " Botkin may not be able to get the letters out anymore . It may not mean anything , little one . You just have to have faith , " he said quietly , hiding his own fears from her . " You sound like Grandmama , " she whispered to him in the dark room as they lay pressed close together . " Sometimes I feel as old . " He had noticed how frail the old woman had become since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensed that Zoya knew it too . She was almost eighty-four years old now , and the past two years had been hard for all of them . It was remarkable that she had survived at all . But they both forgot their concerns for her as their bodies meshed again as one , and they made love until he tiptoed stealthily down the stairs before morning . They spent as much time as possible together in the next few weeks , but on December 10 , almost exactly a month after the end of the war , he came to her with a heavy heart . They were sending him back to the States at the end of the week , but more important than that , he had made a painful decision about her . She heard him say he was leaving as though in a dream . It seemed impossible to believe . He could n't be . The moment she had never faced , the day she had thought would never come , was finally upon them . " When ? " she asked , her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " His eyes never left hers , there was still more to say . And he still wondered if he 'd have the courage to say it . " They do n't give us much time for good-byes , do they ? " Zoya said sadly . They were in her tiny , bleak living room , and it was a gray day , as Evgenia slept peacefully in their room , as she did mostp177of the time now . Zoya was back at work again , but her grandmotherdid n't seem to notice . " Will you be coming back to Paris again ? " Zoya asked him as though he were a stranger , feeling separate from him now , preparingherself for what was to come . There had already been too many good-byes in her life , and she was n't sure she would survive this one . " I do n't know . " " There 's something you 're not telling me . " Maybe he was marriedand had ten children in New York . Anything was possible now . Life had already betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she was even angry at him now . " Zoya . . . I know it wo n't make sense to you , but I 've been thinking a great deal . . . about us . " She waited , blinded by pain . It was amazing that just when one thought there could n't be any more pain , there was . It seemed to be endless . " I want to set you free , to lead your own life here . I thought about taking you to New York with me . . . I wanted to very badly . But I do n't think the Countess could make the trip , and . . . Zoya , " he seemed to choke on the words , he had been thinking about it for days , " Zoya , I 'm too old for you . I 've told you that before . It 's not fair . When you 're thirty , I 'll be almost sixty . " " What difference does that make ? " She had never shared his fears about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hurt at his going making her resentful toward him , especially now . " What you 're saying is that you do n't love me . " " I 'm saying that I love you too much to burden you with an old man . I 'm forty-six years old and you 're nineteen . That 's not fair to you . You deserve someone young and alive , and after everything settles down here , you 'll find someone else to love . You 've never had a chance . You were a child when you left Russia two years ago , you 'd been protected there , and you came here , during the war , with barely more than the clothes on your back . One day , life will be normal again , and you 'll meet someone more your age . Zoya , " he sounded suddenly firm and almost like Konstantin , " it would be wrong to take you to New York . It would be selfish on my part . I 'm thinking of you now , not myself . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tears sprang to her eyes . " It was all a game for you , was n't it ? " She was being cruel but she wanted to be . She wanted to hurt him as much as he wasp178hurting her . " That 's all it was . A wartime romance . A little ballerinato play with while you were in Paris . " He wanted to slap her but he restrained himself . " Listen to me . It was never like that . Do n't be a fool , Zoya . I 'm more than twice your age . You deserve better than that . " " Ahh . . . I see , " the green eyes flashed , " like the happy life I have here . I 've waited out half of this war for you , barely breathing for fear you 'd be killed , and now you get on a ship and go back to New York . It 's easy for you , is n't it ? " " No , it 's not . " He turned so she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better this way . Maybe it was better if she was angry at him . She would n't pine for him when he was gone , as he would for her . " I love you very much . " He turned to face her quietly , as she strode purposefully to the door and yanked it open . " Get out . " He looked stunned . " Why wait two more days ? Why not just end it now ? " " I 'd like to say good-bye to your grandmother . " " She 's asleep , and I doubt if she 'd want to say good-bye to you . She never liked you anyway . " She just wanted him to leave , so she could cry her heart out in peace . " Zoya , please . . . " He wanted to take her in his arms again , but he knew it was n't fair . It was better to let her feel she had ended it , to leave her with some pride . Better if he was the one with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs , the sound of the door slamming behind him ringing in his ears . Hated himself for getting involved with her . He had always known she would get hurt , he just had n't realized that it would hurt him as much . But he was certain he was doing the right thing . There was no turning back . He was too old for her , and even if it hurt her now , she was better off free of him , to find a man her own age , and make a new life for herself . He had a heavy heart for the next two days , and the day before he left , he got a bank draft for five thousand dollars . He enclosed it in a letter to her grandmother , begging her to keep it , and to let him know if there was anything he could do for them later on . He assured her that he would always be their friend , and that he would love her granddaughterfor the rest of his life . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . And because I also suspect that it is what you want as well . She is younger than I. She will fall in love again . I am certain of it . Andp179now , I bid you both adieu with a saddened , but loving heart . " Hehad signed it and had it delivered the morning he left by a corpo- ral on General Pershing 's staff . He left on the morning that President and Mrs. Wilson arrived . There was a parade on the Champs-Elysees for them as he steamed slowly out of Le Havre thinking of Zoya.  |p180For  weeks after Clayton left Zoya , she sat in Antoine 's old room and cried , and thought she would die of a broken heart . Nothing seemed to matter to her anymore . She did n't care if she starved . She made soup for her grandmother , and was surprised they even had enough money left to buy that . Evgenia had sent Prince Markovsky to the bank for her once , shortly after Clayton left , and afterward she had pressed some bills into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Use it to buy whatever you need . " But there was nothing she needed or wanted anymore . He was gone . It felt like the end of her life . But the money her grandmother had apparently saved and gave to her to buy food allowed her to stay home from work . She told them she was ill , and did n't even care if they fired her . The Ballet Busse was back , and if she 'd wanted to , she could have danced with them . But she did n't even want to do that , now . She did n't want anything now , no food , no friends , no job , and certainly no man . He was a fool to have told her she needed a younger man . She did n't need anyone . Except a doctor '  |p181for  Evgenia . She developed a terrible flu on Christmas night . She had insisted she wanted to go to church anyway . But she was too weak even to sit up , and Zoya insisted that she lie back quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor back with him at once , but it was hours before they came back to see her . The doctor was a kindly old man , who had learned Russian as a child , and he spoke to Evgenia in her own tongue . Her flawless French seemed to have faded from her mind . " She is very ill , mademoiselle , " he whispered to Zoya in the living room . " She may not live the night . " " But that 's ridiculous . She was fine this afternoon . " As fine as she ever was now . He had to be wrong . Had to be . Zoya knew she would not survive another loss . She just could n't face it . " I 'll do everything I can . You must call me at once if she gets any worse . Monsieur can come to find me at my home . " He was recentlyback from the front himself , and he was practicing medicineout of his home . He glanced at Prince Vladimir , who nodded unhappily , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with you . " She nodded . She knew she had nothing to fear from him . He had been living with a woman for almost a year , and his daughter had been so furious , she had moved out and was living in a convent on the Left Bank . " Thank you , Vladimir . " She went to make her grandmother a cup of tea , and when she slipped back into her room she found her almost delirious . Her face was white-hot , and her whole body seemed to have shrunken in a matter of hours . Zoya realized suddenly how much weight she had lost recently . It was n't as apparent when she was dressed , but now she looked desperately frail , and when she opened her eyes , she had to struggle to see who Zoya was . " It 's me , Grandmama . . . shh . . . do n't talk . " She tried to help her sip the tea , but Evgenia only pushed it away , muttered to herself , and then slept again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . Zoya had been sitting in the chair , watching her , and she hurried to her side to hear the words . Her grandmother had been waving her hand , and Zoya approached quietly , gave her a sip of water for her parched lips , and gave her some of the medicine the doctor had left , but she could see that she was much worse.  | .. You must .. . " Grandmama ... do n't talk . . . you 'll tire yourself . " The old woman shook her head . She knew better than that . It did n't matter now . " . . . You must thank the American for me ... tell him I am very grateful to him . . . I was going to pay him back ... . " For what ? " Zoya looked confused . Why was she grateful to Clayton ? For leaving them ? For abandoning her and going back to New York ? But Evgenia was waving weakly toward the tiny desk in the corner of the room . " ... Look . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer , and found it there . She pulled it out , put it on the desk , untied it , and gasped . There was a fortune there . Almost five thousand dollars when she counted it out . " My God . . . Grandmama , when did he give this to you ? " She was stunned and she did n't understand . Why would he do something like that ? " He sent it when he left . . . I was going to send it back .. . but I was afraid . . . if you needed it . . . I knew he meant well . We will return it to him when we can .... " But she was fumbling behind her bed as she spoke , looking for something she thought was concealed there , and Zoya saw that she was becoming agitatedand was afraid it would do her more harm . " Grandmama , lie down . . . please . . . " She was still stunned by the veritable fortune Clayton had sent . It was a grand gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't need his charity . It was too easy to buy them off . . . but at what price , and then suddenly she frowned at the old wool scarf her grandmother held in her trembling hands , as she seemed to pull it from behind her pillow . It was the scarf she had worn the day they left St. Petersburg , she remembered it well , and now her grandmother held it out to her , a small smile on her pale lips . " Nicholas ... " she could scarcely speak , as tears filled her eyes , .. you must keep it safe , Zoya . . . take good care of it .. . when there 's nothing left , sell it . . . but only when you are desperate . . . not before . . . there is nothing else left . " " Papa 's cigarette case , and Nicolai 's ... ? " she asked , but the old woman shook her head . .. I sold them a year ago . . . we had no choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her heart . There was nothing left ofp183them now , no trinket , no souvenir , only memories , and whatever it was that her grandmother now held in her hands . Zoya took it from her carefully and unwrapped the scarf on the bed , and as she did , she gasped . . . she remembered it . . . it was the Easter egg Nicky had given Alix when Zoya was seven years old . . . it was incredible , made by Faberge , it was a veritable work of art . The Easter egg itself was of a pale mauve enamel , with diamond ribbons circling the enamel gracefully , and a tiny spring opened it revealing a miniature gold swan on a lake of aquamarine , and crying softly , she touched the lever she remembered beneath the wing . The swan spread its tiny golden wings , and walked slowly across her palm . " Keep it safe , precious one . . . " her grandmotherwhispered , and closed her eyes as Zoya wrapped it in the scarf again , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " Evgenia opened her eyes again , with a peaceful smile . " Stay with me . . . please do n't go . . . " She sensed that the old woman was more comfortable , she seemed to breathe more easily . " Be a good girl , little one . . . I have always been so proud of you . . . " She smiled again as Zoya began to sob . " No , Grandmama . . . " The words were a farewell , and she would n't let her die . " Do n't leave me alone , Grandmama .. . please . . . " But the old woman only smiled and closed her eyes for a last time . She had given her final gift to the child she had so loved , she had brought her safely to a new life , had watched over her , but now it was over . " Grandmama . . . " Zoya whispered in the silent room , but Evgenia 's eyes were closed . She was resting peacefully . Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone home.  |p184They  buried her in the Russian cemeteryoutside Paris , and Zoya stood silently beside Prince Vladimir , and a handful of people who had known Evgenia . She had n't been close to any of them . Her years in Paris had been spent mostly with Zoya , and she had no patience with the complaints and depressing memories of the other emigres . She was occupied with the present and not obsessed with the past . She died on the sixth of January , 1919 , in the tiny apartment , the same day Theodore Roosevelt died in his sleep , and Zoya sat staringout the window , stroking Sava . It was impossible to absorb the events of the past few days , more incredible still to think of a life without her grandmother . She was still amazed by the imperial egg her grandmother had concealed for almost two years , and the money Clayton had given her when he left . It would be enough for her to live on for the next year , if she lived carefully , and for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never wanted to see the ballet again , never wanted to do anything again . She just wanted to sit there with herp185dog and die quietly . And then she thought guiltily of how angry her grandmother would be at her for those thoughts . Her grandmother had been committed not to death , but to life . She lived quietly for a week without seeing anyone , and she looked thinner and very pale , when Vladimir knocked on her door . He looked quiet and strained , and he was obviously worried about her , and she was startled when she saw that there was someone standing just behind him in the dark hall when she opened the door . Perhaps he 'd brought the doctor to check on her , but she did n't want to see anyone , and the doctor least of all . She was wearing black wool stockings and a black dress , her red hair pulled severely back in sharp contrast to her ivory face . " Yes ? " Vladimir hesitated as he spoke . He had almost been afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great for her , but he knew that they had to come . " Hello , Vladimir . " Withoutsaying a word , he stepped aside , and she gasped as she saw Pierre Gilliard behind him . His eyes filled with tears as he looked at her , it seemed a thousand years since they 'd last met on the day she left Tsarskoe Selo . He took a step toward her and she fell into his arms . And then she looked up at him , begging him , barely able to speak through her sobs . " Have they come at last ? " Gilliard was the tutor the imperial daughters had studied with all their lives , and Zoya knew he had gone to Siberia with them , but unable to speak , he only shook his head in answer . " No . . . " he answered finally . " No . . . they have not ... " She waited for more news from him , and feeling her body turn to stone , she walked inside to the ugly living room , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately pale . Vladimir left them alone then . He closed the door softly as he went , and with head bowed , walked slowly down the stairs to his taxi . " Are they all right ? " Her heart pounded as she waited for Pierre Gilliard to speak , and as they faced each other in chairs , he reached out and took her hands in his own . Hers were like tiny icebergs , as Gilliard began speaking . " I have only just now come from Siberia . . . I had to be certain before I came . . . We left them in Ekaterinburg in June . They told us we had to leave . " It was as though he wanted to apologize , but all she wanted to hear was that Mashka and the others were allp186right . She sat in stunned silence , amazed just to see him there , as she clung to him with her icy hands trembling . " You were n't there then when . . . when Nicholas . . . " She could not bring herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miserably shook his head . " Gibbes and I had to leave . . . but we went back again , in August . They let us into the house , but there was no one there , mademoiselle . " He could n't bring himself to tell her what they 'd found , the bullet holes , and the pale traces of washed blood . " They told us they had moved them somewhere else , but Gibbes and I feared the worst . " She waited for the rest with a pounding heart , sure that there would be a happy end to it . After all this time , there had to be . Life surely could n't be so cruel as to let the Bolsheviks kill the people she loved so much . . . one frail little boy , and four girls who had been her cousins and friends and their mother who loved them . It was bad enough that their father had died . It could n't possibly get any worse than that . She watched his face as he went on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still exhausted from the trip , and he had arrived in Paris only the night before , determined to see her . " We arrived back in Ekaterinburg on Alexis 's birthday , but they were gone by then , " he sighed . " We 've been there ever since . I was certain , even when I saw the bullet holes in the house , that they were still alive . " She felt her heart stop and stared at him . " Bullet holes . Did they shoot Nicky there in front of the children ? " " They killed Nagorny three days before . . . he tried to stop a soldier from stealing Alexis 's medals . The Tsarevich must have been heartbroken , he 'd been with him all his life . " Faithful Nagorny , who had refused to abandon them . Was there no end to it ? " In the middle of July the Bolsheviks told them that their relativeswere going to try and rescue them and they had to be moved before their whereabouts could be discovered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her where they were . But who was it who tried to save them ? " The bloody revolution had been raging since June , it was almost impossible to go anywhere . But they got them up at midnight and told them to dress . " His voice caught and Zoya clutched his hands so tightly , they ached , as his eyes reached into hers , two people left on a deserted island , thep187others gone . . . but where ? She waited for the rest without saying a word . Soon , soon he would tell her that they were on their way to Paris . " They went downstairs , the Empress , Nicholas , and the children . . . Anastasia still had Jimmy with her , " Alexis 's little spaniel , Pierre Gilliard began to cry again at the thought of it , .. and Joy .. . " Sava whined as though she knew her mother 's name and he went on , " . . . The Tsarevich could no longer walk by then , he had been very ill ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement to wait for transportation ... Nicholashad them bring chairs for Alexandra , and Alexis , and he was . . . " He could barely go on , " . . . he was holding him , Zoya , across his lap , when they came in ... he was holding him when they opened fire . " She felt her heart turn to stone , it must have been the moment when they killed Nicholas , but Gilliard sobbed as he went on . " They shot them all , Zoya Konstantinovna .. . they opened fire on all of them , only Alexis lived a little longer than the rest of them , they beat his head in with rifle butts as he clutched his father ... and then they murdered little Jimmy . Anastasia had fainted and when she screamed , they killed her with bayonets , and then , " he went on as Zoya cried silently , unable to believe what he told her . " They put them all into a mine , and covered them with acid . . . they are gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . . . even poor , sweet Baby . " Zoya took him in her arms then and held him there as he cried . Even now , months later , he himself was unable to believe it . " We found Joy , one of the solders had taken her in , she was almost starved when they found her near the mine . . . crying for the children she loved . And oh , Zoya , no one will ever know how dear they were , or how much we loved them . " " ... Oh , God . . . oh , God ... my poor little Mashka .. . murdered with rifles and bayonets . . . how frightened she must have been ... . " Nicholas stood to stop them . . . but there was no stopping them . If only they had let us stay . . . but it would have made no difference . " He did n't tell her the White Russians had come to liberate Ekaterinburg eight days later . Only eight days . It might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with empty eyes . Nothing mattered now . Nothing would ever matter again .. . not to her ... or to-them ... she buried her face in her hands and cried as he held her.  | " I had to tell you myself . . . I 'm so sorry . . . so very sorry . . . " Such small words for the loss of such extraordinary people . How little they had understood on that last day at Tsarskoe Selo , and she knew then that she should have stayed with them , the Bolsheviks could have killed her too . . . should have .. . killed her with bayonets and bullets , as they had killed Mashka , and all of them . .. and Baby . . . . He left her then , promising to return the next day after he had slept . He could n't bear to look at her as he left , the broken eyes , the empty face . And when she was alone again , she clutched Sava to her , and rocked her back and forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oh , Grandmama . . . they 're gone . . . they 've killed them all .. .. " And in the end only one whisper left in the silent room as she said her name for the last time .... She would never be able to bear saying it again .. . she whispered softly ... " my Mashka ... "  |p189Zoya  felt as though she were in shockfor several days after she heard the news from Pierre Gilliard . Added to the pain of her grandmother 's death was the agony of the knowledge of the execution . Dr. Botkin had died with the rest of them , Pierre told her the next day when he returned , which explained why none of her letters had gotten through , but there was no one to answer them anyway . And she knew that Grand Duke Michael had been shot too , a week before the execution of Nicholas and Alexandra and the children . Four more grand dukes had been murdered after that . The list was seemingly endless . It was as though they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . And the details were brutal beyond description . In the face of what she now knew , it was understandable that the Versailles Peace Conference meant little to her . For her , the war , and even its end , no longer held any meaning . She had lost her parents , her brother , her grandmother , her cousins , her friends , and her homeland , and even the man she loved had aban/doned her . As she sat in the tiny apartment day after day , staring out the window , her life seemed like a wasteland . Pierre Gilliard came back to visit her several times before he left . He was going home to Switzerland for a rest , before returning to Siberia to help continue the investigation . But even that did n't seem important to her anymore . Nothing did . For Zoya , it was all over . By the end of January , Paris was in high spirits again , and Americansoldiers seemed to fill the streets . There were parties and special performances and parades , all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Versailles and celebrate the end of the Great Adventure , and usher in the new era of peace that was dawning . But for Zoya , there were no celebrations . Vladimir came to visit her several times , after Pierre Gilliard left for Bern to join his wife , but Zoya barely talked as Vladimir sat watching her , afraid now for her sanity as well as her safety . The news had slowly spread to all of the emigres , and there were endless tears , and silent mourning . The Romanovs would be sorely missed , and to those who had known them , never forgotten . " Let me take you for a drive , little one . It would do you good to go somewhere . " " I have everything I need here , Vladimir . " She looked at him sadly , and quietly stroked little Sava . He brought her food , as he had done when they first arrived . In desperation , he even brought her vodka . Perhaps , if nothing else , she could at least drown her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched , like most of the food he brought her . She seemed to be wasting away , it was almost as though she was willing herself to die , anxious to join the others . Several of the women he knew dropped in on her as well , but more often than not , she did n't answer when they knocked . She just quietly sat there , waiting for them to go away , and sitting alone in the dark apartment . By late January , he was frightened , and had even spoken to a doctor . There seemed to be nothing for them to do , except wait for the tides to turn . But he was afraid she would do something drastic before that . ' He was still thinking about her late one afternoon , as he drove his taxi to the Crillon , hoping for one of the important Americans to hail him . And then , as if it were an answer to a prayer , he lookedp191across the street and saw him . He honked frantically , and waved , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Vladimir leapt out of his car , he prayed that it had n't been an illusion . He dashed across the street and into the hotel , barely catching him as he stepped into an elevator . Clayton Andrews turned with a look of amazement as Vladimir called him . He stepped slowly off the elevator then , afraid that something terrible might have happened . " Thank God it 's you . " Vladimir sighed with relief , hoping that he would still be willing to see the girl . He was n't sure what had happened between the two , but he knew that there had been some kind of estrangement before Clayton had left Paris . " Has something happened to her ? " It was all Clayton could think of as he saw the look on Vladimir 's face . He had arrived the day before , and had had to force himself not to go and see her . But he knew there was no point in torturing himself or Zoya . They were better off like this . He wanted her to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her to find it , no matter how much he missed her . He had barely reached New York , when they asked him to return to Paris to assist with the many meetings associated with the treaty at Versailles before leaving the army forever . And he had come back with considerable trepidation . He did n't know if he was strong enough to go back to Paris and not see her . " Is it Zoya ? " he asked the tall Prince , frightened by the look in his eyes . It spoke volumes . " Can we go somewhere to talk ? " Vladimir looked around the crowded lobby and back into Clayton 's eyes . He had a great deal to tell him . Clayton looked at his watch . He had two hours before he had to be anywhere . He nodded and followed Vladimir outside to the conveniently waiting taxi . " Just tell me , man , is she all right ? Has anything happened to her ? " The Prince looked sorrowful as he started the car , his frayed cuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped moustache was still impeccably neat , the snow white hair . Everythingabout him bespoke nobility and distinction . There were so many like him in Paris now . Counts and princes and dukes and just men of good families , driving taxis and sweeping streets and waiting on tables . " Nothing has happened to her , Captain , " he said , and Claytonp192heaved a sigh of relief . " At least not directly . " They drove to the Deux-Magots , took a table in the back , and Clayton ordered two cups of coffee . " Her grandmother died three weeks ago . " " I was afraid of that . " She had seemed so ill and so frail when he left Paris more than a month before . " But worse than that , Pierre Gilliard came from Siberia to see her . The news was terrible . She has n't left the apartment since he told her . I 'm afraid she 'll lose her mind , just sitting there , grieving for them . It 's too much for her . " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ordered something stronger . He could have used a stiff vodka . Just thinking about her broke his heart . Too much had happened to all of them , and now especially to Zoya . " Was Gilliard there when they killed the Tsar ? " He had a heavy heart himself , just thinking about it , although he had never known the man . But Zoya had brought him to life , with her tales of Livadia and the yacht and Tsarskoe Selo , and now he felt almost as though he knew him . " Apparently the soldiers of the Soviet sent him and the English tutor away shortly before , but they came back two months later , and they 've been speaking to soldiers and guards and local peasantsin Ekaterinburg for months , helping with the White Army investigations . They know most of it and he wants to go back and talk to them some more . But it does n't matter anymore . " His eyes were old and sad as he looked at Clayton Andrews . " They 're all dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time as the Tsar .. even the children . " He was not ashamed of the tears that rolled down his cheeks . He cried every time he thought of it . He had lost so many good friends . They all had . But Clayton Andrews looked shocked , horrified , and he knew what it would do to Zoya . " Marie as well ? " It was a last hope . . . for Zoya 's sake . . . but Vladimir only shook his head . " All of them . Gone . " He told Andrews details that Gilliard had n't even dared to tell Zoya , of acid and mutilation and burning . What she knew was bad enough . They had wanted to wipe them off the face of the earth , without a trace . But you can not wipe out beauty and dignity and grace , kindness and compassion , and people who were so profoundly good and loving . In effect , they had not succeeded in destroying what they represented . Their bodies were gone but their spirit would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news ? " " I 'm not sure she will survive it . She grows thinner day by day . She wo n't eat , she wo n't talk , she wo n't smile . It breaks my heart just to see her . Will you go to her ? " He was ready to beg him . She must live on . Her grandmother had been old at least , but Zoya was young and alive , at nineteen her life was just beginning . He could not bear to see it end now . She had to live on , to carry with her the beauty they had all seen , into a new life , not bury it with her , as she was doing . Clayton Andrews sighed , pensively stirring his coffee . What Vladimirhad told him was shocking beyond belief , and more than that , it tore at his heart . . . even the boy . . . it was what Pierre Gilliard had said himself when he first heard the news , " The children ! . . . not the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of Zoya again . " I 'm not sure she 'll see me . " " You must try . For her sake . " He did n't dare ask the man if he still loved her . He had always thought he was too old for her anyway , and he had said as much to Evgenia . But he was the only hope left , and he had seen the light in Clayton 's eyes the year he 'd gone to Christmas services with them . At least then , he had loved the girl deeply . " She does n't answer the door most of the time . Sometimes I just leave some food outside for her , and eventually she takes it in , though I 'm not sure that she eats it . " But he did it for her grandmother . He would have wanted someone to do as much for Yelena . And now he was begging Clayton Andrews to go and see her . He would have done anything to help her . He was almost sorry Gilliard had come , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping forever . " I 'll do my best . " He glanced at his watch . He had to get back to the hotel for one of the endless meetings . He stood up and paid for the coffee , and thanked Vladimir on the way back to the hotel , wondering if she would let him in . In her eyes , he had deserted her , and he knew that she had not understood his reasons . He thought she hated him now , and perhaps that was for the best , for her sake . But he could n't let her just sit there and die . The picture Vladimir painted was a nightmare . He sat impatiently through his meetings that night and at ten o'clock , he went outside and hailed a taxi , and gave the driver her address . It was a relief to discover that for once the driver wasFrench , and not one of the noble Russians.  |p194The  building looked painfully familiar when he arrived , and for a moment he hesitated , before walking slowly up the stairs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to say . Maybe all he could do was just be there . The walk to the fourth-floor apartment seemed interminable , and the halls were even colder and darker and more fetid than he remembered . He had left her six weeks before , but in that short time , so much had changed , so much had happened . He stood outside her door for a long time , listening , wondering if she was asleep , and then he jumped as he heard footsteps . He knocked softly once , and the footsteps stopped . They stopped for a long time , and when she was satisfied he 'd gone away , he heard them again , and this time he heard Sava bark . It made his heart beat faster just thinking of her so near , but he could n't think of himself now , he had to think of her . He had come here to help her , not to help himself , and he had to force himself to think of that as he knocked again , and spoke through the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegramme ! " It was an awful trick , but he knew that otherwise she would n't open the door . The footsteps approached , and the door opened a crack , but from where he stood , she could n't see him . And then with a single step and gentle push , he opened it wider and pushed her aside , speakinggently . " You should be more careful , mademoiselle . " She gasped , and her face was deathly pale . He was shocked at how thin she was . The Prince was right . She looked terrible as she faced him with wide , frightened eyes . " What are you doing here ? " " I dropped by from New York to see how you are . " He tried to sound flip , but the way she looked told its own tale . She was beyond laughter , beyond love , beyond caring . " Why did you come here ? " She stood looking angry and very small , and it almost broke his heart . He wanted to take her in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid he might break her . " I wanted to see you . I 'm here for the peace treaty negotiations at Versailles . " They were still standing in the doorway , and he looked at her questioningly as Sava came to lick his hand . She had n't forgotten , even if Zoya no longer cared to remember . " May I come in for a few minutes ? " " Why ? " Her eyes were big and sad , but more beautiful than ever.  |p195And  he could n't lie to her anymore . " Because I still love you , Zoya , that 's why . " It was n't what he-had planned to say , but he could n't stop himself from saying the words to her . " That 's not important anymore . " " It is to me . " " It was n't six weeks ago , when you left . " " It was very important to me then too . I thought I was doing the right thing for you . I thought you had a right to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her everything materially , but he could n't give her youth or the years he had wasted before he met her . And that had seemed important at the time , now he was n't so sure , in the face of everything Vladimir had told him . " I left you here because I love you , not because I did n't . " But he knew , as he had then , that she had n't understood it . " I did n't mean to abandon you . I had no idea that so much would happen after I left . " " What do you mean ? " She looked up at him sadly , and sensed that he knew , but she was not sure how much . " I saw Vladimir this afternoon . " " And what did he tell you ? " She stood stiffly away from him , watching his eyes , as his heart went out to her . She had suffered so much . It was n't fair . It should have happened to someone else . Not to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Vladimir . He felt sorry for all of them . But more than that , he loved her . " He told me everything , little one . " He took one step closer to her and pulled her gently into his arms , and much to his surprise , she did n't fight him . " He told me about your grandmother , " he hesitated , but only for a moment , " . . . and your cousins . . . and poor little Mashka . . . " She gulped on a sob , and turned her face away as he held her , and then as though suddenly the dam had broken , she began to sob in his arms , and he gently kicked the door closed and carried her like a very small child into the apartment and sat down on the couch , still holding her while she cried . She cried for a very long time , shaking horribly , as she told him everything she 'd heard from Gilliard , racked by sobs , as she 'd been then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then at last , the room was silent again , and there was only the sound of an occasionalsniff . She turned broken green eyes up to his , and he kissed her gently as he had longed to do since he left her . " I wish I 'd been here when he came . " " So do I , " she admitted , crying softly again . " Everything 's beenp196so terrible since you left . . . it 's all been so awful ... and Mashka . . . oh , God , poor Mashka . . . at least Pierre said that the bullets killed her quickly . But the others ... " " Do n't think about it anymore . You must put it behind you . " " How can I ? " She was still sitting on his lap , and it reminded her of talks long ago with her father . " You have to , Zoya . Think of your grandmother , think how brave she was . She took you out of Russia in a troika , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for you to give up hope , to abandon everything , to sit in this apartment and starve to death . She brought you here for a better life , to save your life . Now you must never , never waste it . It would be an affront to her , to her memory , and to all that she tried to do for you . You must honor her and do everything you can to have a good life . " " I suppose you 're right , but it 's so hard now , " and then she remembered and looked up at him shyly . " She told me about the money before she died . I was going to send it back to you , but I 've been using it . " She blushed and looked more like herself again . " I should hope so . " He looked pleased , at least , he had donesomething for her . " Vladimir says you have n't danced in months . " " Not since Grandmama got sick , and after she died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bring myself to go back . " " That 's just as well . " He looked over her shoulder and noticed the samovar with a nostalgic smile . " What do you mean by that ? You know , Diaghilev asked me to go on tour again with them . And I could now , if I wanted to . " She sniffed again , but he smiled at her this time . " No , you could n't . " " Why not ? " " Because you 're going to New York . " " I am ? " She looked stunned . " Why ? " She looked more than ever like a child as he smiled at her . " To marry me , that 's why . You 've got exactly two weeks to sort out your things , and then we leave . How does that sound ? " She looked up at him with wide eyes . " Are you serious ? " " Yes , I am , if you 'll have me . " He realized with a start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . He was going to marry her before they left Paris . And then she would be Mrs. Clayton Andrews , for the rest of her life . " If you 're foolish enough to saddlep197yourself with an old man , then that 's your problem , Miss Ossupov . I 'm not going to warn you anymore . " " Good . " She clung to him like a lost child , crying again , but this time they were tears of joy and not sorrow . " In fact , " he said , setting her gently on her feet as he stood up , " take some things with you now . I 'm going to get you a room at the hotel . I 'm going to keep an eye on you before we leave . I do n't want to have to be pounding on that door , shouting telegramme ' for the next two weeks . " She laughed at him then and dried her eyes . " That was very rude of you ! " " Not as rude as you , pretending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . We can come back here in a few days and get what you want to take with you . " " I do n't have very much . " She looked around the room , there was almost nothing she wanted to take with her , except perhaps the samovar and some of her grandmother 's things . She wanted to leave the past behind and start a new life with him . And then suddenly in terror she glanced up at him . " Are you really serious ? " What if he changed his mind ? What if he left her again , or abandonedher in New York ? He saw the fear in her eyes and his heart went out to her . " Of course I am , little one . I should have taken you with me when I left . " But they both knew she could n't have left her grandmother , and she had n't been well enough to travel then . " I 'll help you pack . " She packed a pathetically small bag , and then remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the only friend she had left , except Clayton , of course . " Can I take Sava to the hotel ? " " Obviously . " He picked up the little dog , who tried frantically to lick his chin , and then he picked up Zoya 's srfiall bag , as she quietly turned out the lights . It was time to go home . She closed the door without looking back , and followed Clayton down the stairs , to a new life.  |p198It  took less than a day to pack up her things . She packed the samovar , and her books , her grandmother 's needlework , and her shawls , her own clothes , and their lace tablecloth , but there was very little else . She gave away the rest to Vladimir , a few friends , and the priest at St. Alexander Nevsky . They said good-bye to Vladimir , and she promised to write . And then in a matter of days , she was standing next to Clayton at the ministry , and became his wife . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with tears rolling slowly down her cheeks . She had lost everything , and now even her own name was gone . But she clung to him for dear life , as they went back to the hotel . It was as though she were terrified that he might change his mind again . They spent two more days in Paris , and then took the train to Switzerland . They had decided to spend their honeymoon there , and she admitted to Clayton that she wanted to see Pierre Gilliard again before she left . It took two days to reach Bern , with the train stopping endlessly everywhere , but as she woke up on the last day , her heart skippedp199a beat . The snowcapped mountains greeted her , and for a moment , it looked as though she were back in Russia . Gilliard met them at the train , and they went home to have lunch with his wife , who had been the Romanov children 's nurse . She embraced Zoya as she cried and Clayton listened as they reminisced over lunch . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness , such happy memories . " When will you go back ? " Clayton asked quietly as Zoya went to look at photographs with Gilliard 's wife . " As soon as we feel strong again . Life in Siberia was very hard on my wife . I do n't want to take her back with me . Gibbes and I have agreed to meet , and see if there is any more we can find out . " Does it matter now ? " Clayton was honest with him . It all seemed to be over now , and there was no point clinging to the painful past . He had told Zoya as much , but Gilliard seemed to be obsessed with it . It was even more real to him , but it was understandable , he had been with the Tsar 's children for twenty years , and they were his entire life . " It matters to me . I wo n't rest until I know everything , until I find any of them who survived . " It was a new thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe there is . But I must be certain of it , or I shall never rest . " " You loved them very much . " " We all did . They were an extraordinary family , even some of the guards in Siberia softened when they got to know them . They had to keep changing them in order to keep things rough . It frustrated the Bolsheviks no end . Nicholas was kind to everyone , even to those who had destroyed his empire . I do n't think he ever forgave himself for abdicating to them . He was always reading history , and he told me that one day , the world would say of him that he had failed . . . that he had given up . . . I think it broke his heart . " It was an insight into the man the others would never know . A glimpse back to a special time that would never come again , for any of them . The grandeur of what they had all known dwarfed even what he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be happy there . She would never be cold or hungry again . At least he had that to give . He had already thought of buying a house for her . His own brick mansion on lower Fifth Avenue suddenly seemed much too small.  |p200They  spent three days in Bern , and then he took her to Geneva and Lausanne . They got back to Paris in late February , and they took the Paris to New York . She sailed from Le Havre on a beautiful day , her four smokestacks standing tall . She was a beautiful ship , the pride of the French Line , and she had sat idle for three years , since she was launched halfway through the war . Zoya was like an excited child for most of the trip . She had gained back a little weight and her eyes had come alive again . They had dinner at the captain 's table several times , and they danced late into the night . She almost felt guilty for having so much fun . She had left so many people behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her think of it now . He only wanted her to look ahead , to the new life they would share . He talked of the house they would build , the people she would meet , the children they would have . She had her whole life ahead of her . She was not even twenty years old , and life had only just begun for her . And the night before they reached New York , she gave him the wedding gift she had been saving for him . It was still wrapped in her grandmother 's scarf . And he gasped when he saw the egg , and how intricately exquisite it was . She set the tiny gold swan on the table when he had opened it , and showed him how it worked . " It 's the most beautiful thing I 've ever seen . . , no , the second most beautiful , " he said , smiling at her . She looked at him with disappointed eyes , she had so wanted him to love it as much as she did . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relic she had of her past . " What was the first ? " " You , my love . You are the most beautiful and the best . " " Silly man . " She laughed at him , and he made love to her all that night . They were both still awake when the Statue of Liberty came into sight , as they docked in New York the next morning.  |p203Zoya  stood on the deck and watched with awe as the Paris docked at the French Line pier on the Hudson . They boasted of having the longest gangplank in the world , and she was wearing a black Chanel suit that Clayton had bought her before they left Paris . Chanel had moved to the rue Cambon by then , and her designs seemed far more exciting than Poiret 's , although she was n't as famous . Zoya wore a matching cloche , with her hair pulled into a tight knot , and she had felt very chic when she had bought it , but now as she looked around , she felt suddenly dowdy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she had n't seen as many jewels since she 'd left Russia . All she had was the narrow gold wedding band Clayton had slipped on her finger when they were married . There was no evidence of champagne anywhere , unlike their departure from Le Havre . The French ships had to respect a new prohibition on alcohol , and all evidence of liquor had to disappear once they were inside the three-mile limit . They could only serve alcohol in international waters , unlike American ships , whichp204served none at all . It was making the French and British ships very popular . The skyline of New York looked like nothing she had ever seen . Gone the churches , domes , and spires and ancient elegance of Russia , or the graceful splendor of Paris . This was modern and alive and exciting and she felt very young as he led her to his Hispano-Suiza , and his chauffeur ushered their trunks through customs . " Well , little one , what do you think ? " He was watching her with happy eyes as they drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had once shared with his wife . It was elegant and small and had been decorated by Elsie de Wolfe . The two women had been good friends , and she had decorated the homes of the Astors and the Vanderbilts in New York , as well as those of many of their friends in Boston . " Clayton , this is wonderful ! " It was a lifetime from the snowcoveredroads she had traveled by troika , going to Tsarskoe Selo . There were horses and cars in the streets , women in brightly colored coats trimmed in fur , and men hurrying along beside them . Everyone looked happy and excited , and Zoya 's eyes danced as she stepped from the car and looked up at the brick mansion . It was smaller than Fontanka Palace certainly , but by American standards it was still very large , and as she stood in the marble hall , two gray-uniformed maids in proper aprons and caps took her coat , and she smiled at them shyly . " This is Mrs. Andrews , " Clayton announced quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wandered in with two more maids , fresh from the kitchen . The butler was British and looked very serious , and the house bore all the earmarksthat Mrs. de Wolfe was so fond of , French antiques mixed with " moderne , " as she liked to call it . He had already told Zoya that she could change anything she wanted , he wanted her to feel at home , but she loved what she saw , and there were wide French windows looking out on a snow-covered garden . She clapped her hands like a child as he laughed , and walked her upstairs to their bedroom . There were pink satin bedspreads and curtains and a lovely chandelier , and there was a dressing room with pink satin walls just for her , with closets that reminded her of her mother 's . And she laughed at the sight of her few dresses hanging there when the maid unpacked for her that afternoon.  | " I 'm afraid the servants will be very disappointed , " she laughed as she stood naked in her dressing room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sumptuous marble bathtub . . . gone the horrors of the tiny bathtub in the room at the end of the hall in the apartment near the Palais Royal . She would never again have to share her bathroom with her neighbors . It was all like a dream as she looked around her and at the man who had saved her from the agonies of her life in Paris . She had had no idea how wealthy he was , or how important in New York society . In his uniform , and with his unassuming ways , there had been no reason to suspect it . " Why did n't you tell me about all this ? " " It would n't have made any difference anyway . " He knew that was not why she loved him , and that was refreshing too . It was a relief not to be hounded by aging debutantes , or the daughters of his late mother 's friends , recently widowed or divorced , on the prowl for a prosperous wellborn husband . And he fitted the bill perfectly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , and he had saved her . " I was always so embarrassed talking to you about life in St. Petersburg . . . I was afraid you would think it all so excessive . " " I did , " he laughed , " but also excessively charming . . . like my pretty bride . " He watched her slip into her new satin underwear , and then decided just as quickly to remove it . " Clayton ! " But she did n't object as he carried her back to bed . They were late for dinner every night , and Zoya was embarrassed by the butler 's obvious disapproval . The servants were not warm to her , and she was aware of a certain amount of whispering whenever she walked through the house . They served her , but reluctantly , and whenever possible they mentioned his previous wife . The ex-Mrs . Andrews had apparentlybeen the epitome of perfection . The maid even managed to leave a copy of Vogue in her dressing room , open to the pages where Cecil Beaton raved about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her friends in Virginia . " She was lovely , was n't she ? " Zoya asked quietly one night , as they sat by the fire , in their bedroom . But here , the fireplace only enhanced the decor , it was not a necessity for their very survival . She thought sadly more than once of Vladimir in his freezing apartment , and their other friends , literally starving in Paris . She felt guilty for all that Clayton gave her.  | " Who was lovely ? " He looked at her without understanding . " Your wife . " Her name was Margaret . " She was very well dressed when she wanted to be . But so are you , little Zoya . We have n't even begun to go shopping yet . " " You spoil me too much . " She smiled shyly at him , blushing in the way that touched his heart , as he reached out and pulled her to him . " You deserve far more than I can ever give you . " He wanted to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had suffered in Paris after they left Russia . The imperial Easter egg was proudly displayed on the mantel in their bedroom , along with photographs of his parents in handsome silver frames , and three tiny exquisite gold sculptures that had been his mother 's . " Are you happy , little one ? " She beamed up at him in answer in the quiet room . " How could I not be ? " He introduced her to his friends , and took her everywhere with him , but they were both aware of the quiet resentment of the other women . She was pretty , she was young , and she looked exquisite in the expensive gowns he bought her . " Why do they dislike me so much ? " She felt the pain of it more than once , as the women stopped speaking when she arrived , and quietly shunned her . " They do n't dislike you , they 're just jealous . " He was right , but by late May , he was furious at the rumors they had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheap little dancer in Paris . . . there was vague mention of the Folies-Bergere , a drunken lout at his club had even asked him if she did the cancan , and Clayton was hard pressed not to strike him . One woman at a party asked another as they watched Zoya dance if it was true that she had been a paid whore in Paris . " She must have been . Just look at how she dances ! " She had mastered the steps of the new fox-trot to perfection , under Clayton 's careful direction . And he stood handsome and proud as he whirled her around the floor , so obviously in love with his beautiful young wife that it made everyone hate her . She was twenty years old with a waist he could encircle with both hands , graceful legs , and the face of an angel . And when the waltz struck up , she felt tears sting her eyes , as they moved slowly around thep207floor , looking up at him with the memory of the night they 'd met , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , she was in St. Petersburg again . . . dancing with Konstantin , or handsome young Nicolai in the uniform of the Preobrajensky Guard . . . or even Nicholas at the Winter Palace . She remembered the coming-out ball she was to have , and never had , and now none of it seemed quite so painful . He had made it all up to her , and now she was even able to look at her photographs of Mashka , with a sad smile , but without tears . She would carry her friends and her loved ones with her in her heart forever . " I love you so much , little one . . . " he whispered as they danced at the Astors ' ball in June , and then suddenly she stopped and stared , as though she had seen a ghost . Her feet were rooted to the floor , and her face went pale , as Clayton whispered to her , " Is something wrong ? " " It ca n't be . . . " She looked ill as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , stunningly handsome man had just entered the room with a pretty woman in a shimmering blue gown . " Do you know them ? " But she could not speak . It was Prince Obolensky , or someone who looked exactly like him , and the woman on his arm appeared to be the Grand Duchess Olga , the young Grand Duchesses ' aunt who had brought them into town every Sunday for lunch with their grandmother , before stopping for tea at the Fontanka Palace with Zoya . " Zoya ! ... " He was afraid she might faint , as the woman stared and gave a gasp of surprise as she hurried toward them . Zoya gave a little cry like a child , and flew into her arms . " Darling . . . is it you ? . . . oh , my little Zoya . . . " Lovely Olga folded her into her arms as they both cried tears of joy , filled with the tender memories of the loved ones they had lost , as Clayton and Prince Obolensky watched them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtsied low , and turned to introduce her handsome husband . " Olga Alexandrovna , may I present my husband , Clayton Andrews . " He bowed and kissed the Grand Duchess 's hand , and afterward Zoya explained that Olga was the Tsar 's youngest sister . " Where have you been since . . . " She had difficulty saying the words as their eyes met . She had n't seen her since they both left Tsarskoe Selo.  | " I was in Paris with Grandmama . . . she died after Christ-mas . " The Grand Duchess embraced the girl again , as everyone in the ballroom watched , and within hours it was everywhere . Clayton Andrews 's new wife was a Russian countess . The tales of the FoliesBergerefaded on the wind , and Prince Obolensky told tales of glorious and exotic balls held at the Fontanka Palace . " Her mother was the loveliest woman I 've ever seen . Cold , of course , as Germans are , and rather high-strung , but incredibly pretty . And her father was a charming man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So many good men gone . " He said it with regret over a glass of champagne , but with less emotion than the women . Zoya never left Olga 's side for the rest of the night . She was living in London , but had come to New York to visit friends . She was staying with Prince Obolensky and his wife , the former Alice Astor . Word spread around New York like fire , about Zoya 's origins , her noble family , her relationship to the Tsar , and within moments she was the darling of society . Cecil Beaton chronicled her every move , and they were invited everywhere . The people who had shunned her suddenly loved her . Elsie de Wolfe wanted to redo the house , and then instead proposed a remarkable suggestion . She and her friends had bought a group of old farms on the East River , and were remodeling the old houses on a street called Sutton Place . It was not fashionable yet , but she knew that when it was finished it would be . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Clayton ? " She was decorating one of them for William May Wright , the stockbroker , and his wife , Cobina . But Zoya thought they were fine where they were in his comfortable brick mansion . Zoya gave her first dinner party for Grand Duchess Olga , before she returned to London again , and her fate was sealed after that . She was destined to become the darling of New York , much to her husband 's delight . He indulged her every whim , and secretly commissionedElsie de Wolfe to remodel one of the houses on Sutton Place for them . It was an elegant gem , and when Zoya saw it , her eyes grew wide in amazement . It was not as excessive as the Wright 's new home , where they had been the night before , and met Fred Astaire and Tallulah Bankhead . The most shocking thing of all had been the mink-lined bathroom , but there was none ofp209that excess in the Andrews home . It was quietly elegant , with marble floors , lovely views , large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain would please the young Russian countess . People had begun to address her as such , but she always insisted that she was now Mrs. Andrews . The thought of using the title seemed ridiculous to her , although Americans seemed to love it . There were scores of other emigres in New York by then , fresh from Paris and London , and some having come directly from Russia , with harrowing tales of their escape as civil war raged on , between Red and White forces trying to take control of the anguishednation . But the White Russians in New York more often than not amused her . There were , of course , the true nobles , many of whom she knew , but dozens of others now boasted titles they had never had in Russia . There were princes and princesses and countesses everywhere . She was even stunned to be introduced to an imperial princess one night , whom she recognized instantly as the woman who had made her mother 's hats , but she said nothing to embarrass her when they were presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to expose her to the ever mourningRussians . She herself entertained many of the nobles who had once been her parents ' friends . But the past was gone , and no amount of talk and pretense , or painful memory , would ever revive it . She wanted to look ahead , to become an integral part of the life she was leading . And only on Christmas did she allow herself the luxury of remembering with fresh tears , as she stood beside Clayton , chanting the familiar Russian hymns and holding the candle which burned so brightly in memory of those she had loved and lost . Christmas was a difficult time , but she had been in New York for nine months by then , and she had exciting news for Clayton . She waited until they came home from church , and as they lay in their huge canopied bed on Sutton Place , she waited until after they 'd made love , and then she told him . " You 're what ? " He looked stunned , and was instantly terrified that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me ? " His eyes glowed and there were tears of joy in her eyes . " I only found out two days ago . " She giggled , feeling as though she were the keeper of the world 's most important secret . One could n't see it yet , but she knew , and ever since the doctor hadp210told her the news , she felt as though she knew life 's true meaning . She had wanted Clayton 's child more than anything , and she kissed him happily as he gazed at her in adoration . She was not yet twenty-one , and they were going to have a baby . " When is it due ? " " Not for a long time , Clayton . Not until August . " He offered to move to another room , so as not to disturb her sleep , and she only laughed at his concern . " Do n't you dare ! If you move to another room , I 'll come with you ! " " That might be fun . " He looked amused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from . And Zoya had her prepare a nursery in the spring . It was all done in pale blue , with sweet murals , and exquisite lace curtains . It was a new touch for Mrs. de Wolfe , who was amused by Cobina Wright Junior'sminiature Rolls , but was pleased by Zoya 's more restrained views of what was suitable for children . Zoya always showed the dignity and good taste to which she 'd been born , and added her own touches to the house on Sutton Place . It had an aura of quiet peace and exquisite beauty that everyone talked about . They had sold the brick mansion on Fifth Avenue long since , and for the most part , hired new servants . And on the day Alexis Romanov , dear sweet Baby , would have become seventeen , their first child was born , a son . The delivery went easily and well , and he was a lusty eight-pound boy who sent up his first cry like a flare , as his father paced nervously outside their bedroom . Zoya was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Clayton finally saw her . The baby had his mother 's red hair , and a round face , as he lay wrapped in lace , and tears of joy ran slowly down Clayton 's cheeks as he saw him . " Oh , he 's so beautiful . . . he looks just like you ... " " Only the hair , " she whispered sleepily . The doctor had given her something to make her drowsy , and she looked dreamily up at her husband , " He has your nose . " It looked like a tiny rosebud in the angelic face as Clayton laughed , and stroked the silky red hair , and then Zoya looked up at him , her eyes pleading in silent question . " May we call him Nicholas ? " " If you like . " He liked the name , and he knew how much itmeant to her . It was both the Tsar 's name , and her dead brother 's . " Nicholas Konstantin . . . " she whispered , looking down at himp211happily , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then tiptoed from the room , grateful for all life 's gifts . After all these years , he had a son . . . a son ! Nicholas Konstantin Andrews . It had a nice ring to it , he laughed to himself , as he hurried downstairs to pour himself a glass of champagne . " To Nicholas ! " he toasted as he stood alone in the room , and then with a smile , " . . . to Zoya ! "  |p212The  next few years flew on angels ' wings , filled with people and excitement and parties . Zoya bobbed her hair , which horrified him , she discovered cigarettes , and then decided they looked foolish . Cecil Beaton wrote about her constantly , and about their famous parties at the house they built for the summers on Long Island . They saw Nijinsky 's last performance in London , and Zoya grieved when she heard that he had gone mad and been committed to an institution in Vienna . But the ballet was no longer a part of her life , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They attended polo matches , receptions , balls , and gave a number of their own , and the only time she slowed down at all was in 1924 , when she again found out she was pregnant . The Prince of Wales had just been to Long Island to visit them , after attending the polo match there . She felt quite ill this time , and Clayton hoped that meant she was having a girl . At fifty-two , he yearned to have a daughter . She was born in the spring of 1925 , the same year that Josephine Baker became the rage in Paris.  |p213And  Clayton 's heart leapt with joy when he first saw the baby . She had the same fiery red hair as her mother and brother Nicholas , and she made her presence known to her admirers at once . She cried the moment her commands were n't obeyed , and she was the apple of his eye from the moment she was born . Alexandra Marie Andrews was christened in the christening gown that had been in Clayton 's family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War of 1812 , and she looked like one of the imperial duchesses when she wore it . Her hair was the color of her mother 's , but her eyes were Clayton 's , and her personality was her own . By the time she was two , she was in command of even her brother . Nicky , as he was called , had the gentleness of his father , and the lively humor that Zoya 's own brother had had . He was a child everyone admired and loved , most especially his mother . But Sasha , by the time she was four , had her father wrapped around the proverbial little finger . And even ancient Sava ran in terror when she was angry . The dog was twelve , and was still with them , ever at Zoya 's heels when she was in the house , or with little Nicky , whom she had adopted . " Sasha ! " Her mother exclaimed in despair , as she came home to find her wearing her best pearls , or an entire bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Clayton always brought her . " You must n't do things like that ! " Even the nurse had a difficult time controlling her . She was a young French girl they had brought back with them from Paris , but no amount of rebukes or gentle reproaches ever impressed the tiny countess . " She ca n't help it , Mama , " Nicholas apologized for her from the door . He was eight years old by then , and as handsome as his father . " She 's a girl . Girls like to wear pretty things . " His eyes met Zoya 's and she smiled . He was so kind , so forgiving , so much like Clayton . She loved them all , but it was Alexandra , Sasha , as she was called , who tried her patience . At night , they were going to the Cotton Club , to dance the night away in Harlem . And only months before they had gone to Conde Nast 's incredible Park Avenue apartment for a fabulous party . Cole Porter was there , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a house for Zoya in Palm Beach , but with her fair skin she had no love for the sun , and was content only to visit there briefly each year , when they went to stay with the Whitneys.  |p214Zoya  was buying her clothes from Lelong that year , and was very fond of his charming wife , Princess Natalie , who was the daughter of Grand Duke Paul , and a Russian like Zoya . And TallulahBankhead had scolded Zoya more than once , telling her that she did n't use enough lip rouge . Fancy-dress balls were the rage , and Clayton particularly enjoyedthem . He was fifty-seven years old , and he was madly in love with his wife , although he teased her mercilessly that year , telling her that she was finally old enough to be married to him , now that she had turned thirty . Hoover had been elected president , defeating Governor AI Smith of New York . Calvin Coolidge had decided not to run again . And the governor of New York was Franklin Roosevelt , an interestingman , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Zoya enjoyed her company , and the conversations they shared , and she was always pleased when the Roosevelts invited them to dinner . They saw the play Caprice with them , and although Clayton was bored , Zoya and Eleanor loved it . They saw Street Scene after that , which won the Pulitzer . But Clayton confessedhe had a much better time at the movies . He was crazy about Colleen Moore and Clara Bow . And Zoya was equally fond of Greta Garbo . " You just like those foreign types , " he teased , but she did n't seem foreign to anyone anymore . Zoya had become totally integratedin the life of New York after ten years . She adored the theater and the ballet and the opera , and had taken little Nicky to see Rosenkavalier with them in January , but he was shocked to see a woman playing a man 's role . " But that 's a girl ! " he had whispered loudly as the people in the next box smiled . Zoya held his small hand gently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had to do with the quality of their voices . " That 's disgusting , " he announced and sank into his seat as Clayton smiled , not sure he did n't agree with him . Nicholas was far more interested in Lindbergh 's flights . And Clayton and Zoya went to Lindbergh 's wedding to Ambassador Morrow 's daughter Anne , in June , shortly before they moved to Long Island for the summer . The children were happy there , and Zoya herself loved to take long walks along the beach , talking to Clayton or their friends , orp215just being alone sometimes , thinking of the summers of her youth , at Livadia , on the Crimea . She still thought about them sometimes , it would have been impossible not to . The figures of the past still lived on in her heart , but the memories were dimmer now , and sometimes she had to grope for their faces . There were framed photographs of Marie , and the other girls , in Faberge frames on the mantel in their bedroom . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loved best , and little Nicholas knew their names and faces too . He loved to hear about what they had been like , what they had said and done , the mischief they 'd gotten into as children , and it intrigued him that he and the Tsarevich shared the same birthday . He liked to hear about the " sad parts , " too , as he called them ... the parts about Grandfather , who must have been very good , and funny Nicolai after whom he was named . She told him about their arguments and their jokes and their disappointments , and she assured him that she and Nicolai had fought almost as much as he and Sasha . At four , he thought she was becoming a terrible nuisance . And there were others in the house who shared his view . She was spoiled by her father , beyond what even Zoya liked , but there was no scolding the child in his presence . " She 's a baby , darling . Do n't upset her . " " Clayton , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't discipline her now . " " Discipline is for boys , " he told his wife , but he never had the heart to reprimand Nicholas either . He was kindhearted to all of them , and played with them endlessly on the beach that summer . King George was healthy again in England by then and it always unnerved Zoya when she saw photographs of him . He looked so much like his first cousin , the Tsar , that it was always a shock to see his face gazing out from a picture . His own little granddaughter , Elizabeth , was only a year younger than Sasha . The thing that impressed little Nicholas most that summer was a performance of Yehudi Menuhin 's in New York . The child was a prodigy on the violin , and only three years older than Nicholas , who was fascinated by the way he played . He talked about it for weeks , which pleased Zoya . Clayton was reading All Quiet on the Western Front on the beach , and he was amusing himself that summer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down since March , and peo/ple were making absolute fortunes . Clayton had bought Zoya two diamond necklaces in the past two months , with just a fraction of his profits . But she was distracted by the sad news that Diaghilev had died in Venice in August . It seemed to close another chapter of history for her , and she talked about him to Clayton as they walked on the beach after she had heard the news . " If it had n't been for him letting me dance , we would have truly starved . There was nothing else I knew how to do , " she looked up at Clayton sadly , as he took her hand , remembering how hard her life had been then , the awful apartment near the Palais Royal , their almost nonexistent meals during the war , it had been a hard time , but it was long in the distant past , and she looked up at him with a smile . " And then there was you , my love . ... " She never forgot how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not someone I could have loved as I love you . " She spoke gently . He bent to kiss her , and they stood for a long time in the last fiery sunset of the summer . They were moving back to New York the next day . Nicholas had to go to school , and Sasha was going to begin kindergarten . Zoya thought it would do her good to be with other children , although Clayton was n't as sure . But he always deferred to Zoya on matters of that nature . They had dinner with the Roosevelts again almost as soon as they got back . They had also just returned from their summer home in Campobello . And a week later , the Andrews gave a party to celebrate the onset of a new social season . Prince Obolensky came of course , as he always did , and a glittering cast of hundreds . The month seemed to fly by with parties , theater , balls , and it was October before they knew it . Clayton was worried that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller to have lunch with him , but he had gone to Chicago for a few days , so he 'd have to wait to see him . And two weeks later , Clayton was too upset to have lunch with anyone . His stocks were plummeting and he did n't want to upset Zoya by telling her , but he had put all their assets into the stock market months before . He had done so well , he was sure that he could triple his family fortune . By Thursday the twenty-fourth , everyone was dumping shares , and everyone Clayton knew seemed to be in a panic . But none more than he , as he went to the stock market himself . He came home in terror that afternoon , and things were worse the next day.  |p217And  Monday was a day of fresh disaster . Over sixteen million shares were dumped , and by nightfall , Clayton knew he was ruined . The stock market closed at one o'clock , in a vain effort to stop the frantic selling of shares , but for Clayton it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of the week , but he had already lost everything they had . All they had left were their homes , and everything in them . The rest was gone . Clayton walked all the way home , and he felt a weight on his chest like a stone . He could barely face Zoya as he walked into their bedroom . " Darling ? . . . what is it ? . . . " His face was gray , as she turned to face him . She had been brushing her hair which she had grown long again because he hated the fashionable bobs so much , but he barely seemed to notice her as he walked into the room and stared into the fireplace with bleak eyes , and then slowly he turned to face her . " What 's wrong ? " Her brush clattered on the floor and she ran to his side . " Clayton . . . Clayton , what is it ? " His eyes reached into hers , and she was suddenly reminded of her father when Nicolai had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . everything . . . I was a fool . ... " He attempted to explain everything to her as she listened with wide eyes , and she put her arms around him and held him as he cried . " My God .. . how could I have been so stupid . . . what will we do now ? " Her heart almost stopped , it was like the revolution again . But she had survived it before , and this time they had each other . " We 'll sell everything . . . we 'll work . . . we 'll survive , Clayton . It does n't matter . " But he wrenched himself from her arms and paced the room , frantic at the full realization that they were ruined , and his world had come crashing down around him . " Are you crazy ? I 'm fifty-seven years old . . . what do you think I can do ? Drive a taxi like Prince Vladimir ? And you 'll go back to the ballet ? Do n't be a fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The children will starve . .. . " He was crying as she took his hands in her own , and his were icy . " They will not starve . I can work , so can you . If we sell what we have , we can live on it for years . " The diamond necklaces alone would keep them fed and housed for a long time , but he shook his head miserably , he understood the situation far better than she . He had already seen a man he knew leap from his office window . And she knew nothing of the enormous debts he had allowed top218accrue , knowing he had the money to pay them whenever he wanted . " And who will you sell it all to ? All the others who 've lost their shirts ? It 's all worthless , Zoya .... " " No , it 's not , " she said quietly . " We have each other and the children . When I left Russia , we left on a troika with nothing , with rags , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sew into the linings of our clothes , and we survived . " They both thought at the same time of the misery of her Paris apartment , but they had lived through it , and now she had him and the children . " Think of what the others lost . . . think of Nicky and Aunt Alix ... do n't cry , Clayton . . . if they could be brave in the face of that , there is nothing we ca n't face . . . is there , my love ... . But he only cried in her arms unable to face it . That night they went down to dinner , and he barely spoke . She was trying to think , to make plans , to decide what to sell and who to sell it to . They had two houses , all the antiques Elsie de Wolfe , now Lady Mendl , had helped them find , her jewelry , paintings , objects . . . it was endless . It was like planning an escape , as she made suggestions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy step , and as she talked to him from her dressing room while she undressed , she could n't elicit an answer from him . She was desperately worried about him . It had been a terrible blow , but after surviving everything else that had happened in her life , she refused to be beaten now . She would help him fight , help him survive , she would scrub floors if she had to . She did n't care , and then as she listened , she wondered if he 'd left the next room . He had n't answered her in several minutes . " Clayton ? " She walked into the room in one of the lace nightgownshe 'd bought her the year before in Paris . She gave a gasp as she saw him , slumped on the floor , as though he had fallen , and she ran to his side , and gently rolled him onto his back . But he stared at her with unseeing eyes . " Clayton ! Clayton ! ... " She began to sob as she shouted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull him across the floor , as though anything she did might revive him . But he did n't move , he did n't see , and he could no longer hear her . Clayton Andrews had died of a heart attack , the shock of the crash too much , the prospect of losing everything more than he could bear , and as she sank to her knees and cried as she held his head onp219her lap , she looked down at him in disbelief . The man that she had loved was dead . He had left her . Desolate , and alone , and poor again , the dream that had become her life was suddenly a nightmare.  | " Mama , why did Papa die ? " Sasha looked up at Zoya with her huge blue eyes , as they rode back from the cemetery in the Hispano-Suiza . Everyone in New York had come , but Zoya had scarcely seen them . She felt as though she were in a daze as she stared down at the child , her heavy black veil concealing her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in mute anguish beside her . Nicholas had stood beside her at the funeral , a tiny man holding her arm , his own eyes filled with tears as the choir sang the agonizinglysweet " Ave Maria . " But there were others like him who had died in the past week , most by their own hand , but a few , like him , felled by the blow they could n't endure . It was n't fear , it was grief , but whatever it was , she had lost him . " I do n't know , sweetheart . . . I do n't know why . . . he had a terrible shock , and . . . he went to be in heaven with God . " She choked on the words , as Nicholas watched her . " Will he be with Uncle Nicky and Aunt Alix ? " Nicholas asked quietly , and she looked at him . She had kept them alive for him ,  |p221but  to what end ? What did it matter now ? Everyone she had ever loved was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them close to her as she left the car , and hurried into the house ahead of the chauffeur . She had invited no one to the house , she did n't want to see anyone , did n't want to have to explain , to tell them anything . It was going to be bad enough to have to tell the children . She had decided to wait a few days , she had already told most of the servants that they were free to go . She was keeping only one maid and the nurse , she could cook for them herself . And the chauffeur was going to leave as soon as she sold the cars . He had promised to do everything he could to help her . He knew several people who had liked Clayton 's Alfa Romeo and the Mercedes she used , and the Hispano-Suiza had been coveted by all . She only wondered if there was anyone left to buy them . Old Sava came to her and licked her hand as though she knew , as Zoya sat next to the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died only days before . It seemed incredible that he was gone . . . that Clayton was no more . . . and now there was so much for her to do . She had called their lawyers the day after he died , and they had promised to explain everything to her . When they did , it was grim . It was as bad as Clayton had feared , and perhaps worse . His debts were absolutely enormous and there was no money left at all . The lawyers advised her to try to sell the house on Long Island at any price , with everything in it . She took their advice , and they put it on the market for her . She did n't even go back to get her things . She knew she could n't have faced it . Everyone was doing much the same thing , the ones who were n't committing suicide , or abandoning their homes in the middle of the night , to avoid bills and mortgage payments . And it was Saturday before she could bring herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals with them , but she had been moving like a machine , moving from room to room , and speaking only when she had to . But she could hardly think . There was so much to do , so much to pack , so much to sell , and nowhere to go once they sold it . She knew she had to get a job but she could n't even think of that yet . She could n't think at all as she looked at them with anguished eyes . She knew Sasha was still too young to understand , but she had to tell Nicholas and she could hardly face the pain in his eyes as she tried . In the end all she could do was hold him close to her as they both cried for the husband andp222father they had loved . But she knew she had to be strong , as strong as her grandmother had been for her , their circumstances had been even worse . She even thought of going back to Paris with them , life might have been cheaper there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serge Obolensky had told her that there were now four thousand Russians driving taxis in Paris . And it would all be too foreign to them . They had to stay in New York , Zoya decided . " Nicholas . . . my love . . . we 're going to have to move . " The words seemed wooden and strange as he looked up at her with confused eyes . " Because Papa died ? " " Yes . . . no . . . well , actually , because . . . " Because now we 're poor . . . because we ca n't afford to live here anymore ... because . . . " because these are going to be difficult times for us . We ca n't stay here anymore . " He looked at her seriously , trying to be brave , as Sasha played with the dog , and the nurse quietly left the room in tears . She knew she would have to leave them now too , and it broke her heart to leave the children she had cared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day before . There was no hiding from it now . " Mama , are we going to be poor ? " " Yes , " she was always honest with him , " in the way I think you mean . We 're not going to have a big house or lots of cars . But we 're going to have the important things .. . except Papa . . . " She felt a lump rise in her throat , " . . . but we have each other , sweetheart . And we always will . Do you remember what I told you about Uncle Nicholas and Aunt Alix and the children when they took them to Siberia ? They were very brave and they made kind of a game of it . They always knew that the important thing was to be together , and to love each other , and to be strong ... and that 's what we have to do now , " the tears were running down her cheeks as she spoke , but Nicholas was looking at her solemnly , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He looked intrigued for the first time and she smiled . " No , darling , we 're not . We 're going to stay here in New York . " " Where will we live ? " Like all children , he was interested in the simpler realities . " In an apartment . I 'll have to find a place for us to live . "  | " Will it be nice ? " She thought instantly of Mashka 's letters from Tobolsk and Ekaterinburg , " We 'll make it nice , I promise you . " And then with sad eyes , he looked at her again , " Can we take the dog ? " Her eyes filled with tears again as she looked at Sava playing with Sasha on the floor , and then back at him . " Of course we can . She came all the way from St. Petersburg with me . " She choked on the words but she looked into his eyes reassuringly , " we 're not going to leave her now . " " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . as many as we can fit into the apartment . I promise . " He smiled , a little mollified , " Good . " And then his eyes grew sad again , thinking of his father and the fact that he would never see him again . " Will we go soon ? " " I think so , Nicholas . " He nodded , and with a last hug for her , he took Sasha and the dog and they left the room , as Zoya sat on the floor , watching them go , praying that she would be as strong as Evgenia had been for her , and as she thought of her , Nicholas tiptoed slowly back into the room and looked down at her where she sat . " I love you , Mama . " She closed her arms around him and tried not to cry , " I love you too , Nicholas . . . I love you so very , very much ... . He bent closer to her then and pressed something into her hand without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold coin , and she knew how proud of it he was . Clayton had given it to him only a few months before , and he had showed it to everyone for weeks . " You can sell it if you like . Then maybe we wo n't be quite so poor . " " No . . . no , my love . . . it 's yours . . . Papa gave it to you . " He stood very tall then , fighting back his own tears . " Papa would want me to take care of you . " Zoya only shook her head , unable to speak , as she pressed the coin back into his hand , and holding him close to her , walked him back to his room.  |p224The  Wrights had lost their money too . Cobina and her daughter had formed a supper club singing act , wearing frontier garb and funny hats . She and Bill were getting a divorce and the house on Sutton Place had been sold for almost nothing . Other women were selling their fur coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quick cash . Everywhere , Zoya saw the same kind of panic there had been in St. Petersburg twelve years before , but without the physical threat of the revolution . Their own house on Long Island sold for barely more than the price of the cars kept there , and Clayton 's attorneys told her to grab it . " Cholly Knickerbocker " reported fresh outrages almost daily . The column was actually written by a man named Maury Paul , and the fates he described now were beyond belief , society ladies becoming waitresses and shopgirls . Some remained unaffectedby the crash , but as Zoya looked around Sutton Place now , it seemed almost deserted . Her own servants were all gone , save the nurse who had looked after the children . Sasha still didn'tp225seem to understand why Clayton was gone , but Nicholas had grown thoughtful and quiet , and asked Zoya constant questions about where they would live , and when they would sell the house . It would have driven Zoya mad , except that she was so sorry for him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes were bottomless green pools of pain and worry . And he stood looking like a sad little man , as he watched her pack her more practical dresses in her bedroom . There seemed to be no point taking her elaborate evening gowns , all the Poirets and Chanels and Lanvins , and Schiaparellis . She wrapped those in bundles and gave them to the nurse to sell in the lobby of the Plaza . The indignity of it would have been crushing , but she was too worried to care . They needed every penny they could get to live on . And in the end , she sold the house with the furniture Elsie de Wolfe had bought for them , the paintings , the Persian rugs , even the china and crystal . It barely managed to cover Clayton 's debts , and gave them enough to live on for only a few months . " Wo n't we keep anything , Mama ? " Nicholas looked around so sadly . " Only what we 'll need in the new apartment . " She pounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and finally she found two small rooms on West Seventeenth Street . It was a tiny walk-up apartment , with two windows looking into the back of another building . It was small and dark and there was an almost overwhelming smell of garbage . For three days , she moved things in herself , with the help of the nurse and an old black man she hired for a dollar . They brought in two beds , and a desk , the settee from her boudoir , one small rug , and some lamps . And she hung the Nattier painting Elsie de Wolfe had recently brought them back from Paris . She dreaded bringing the children there , but in late November , the house on Sutton Place sold , and two days later , they tearfully kissed the nurse good-bye , and standing in the marble hall , Zoya watched her kiss Sasha as they all cried . " Will we ever come back here , Mama ? " Nicholas looked at her , trying to be brave , his chin trembling , his eyes full , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would gladly have tried to spare him the pain of it , but she took his small hand in her own , and pulled her warm coat tightly around her , as she answered.  | " No , darling , we wo n't . " She had packed almost all their toys , and a box of books for herself , not that she could concentrate on anything now . Someone had given her Hemingway 's A Farewell to Arms , but it had sat on her night table , unread . She could barely think , let alone read , and she was going to be busy , looking for a job . The money she 'd gotten from selling the house would only keep them going for a few months , if they were lucky . Nothing was worth anything now , everyone was selling houses and furs and antiques and treasures . None of it was worth more than someone else was able to pay , and the market was glutted with once expensiveobjects that were now worthless . It seemed remarkable that there were others who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report their weddings and parties and dances . There were still people dancing at the EmbassyClub every night , or at the Central Park Casino , to the music of Eddy Duchin . But Zoya felt as though she would never dance again , as she and the children walked down their front steps for a last time with their suitcases , and Sasha 's best doll tucked under her arm . And as though it had happened only the day before , she could think of nothing but the burning of the Fontanka Palace ... her mother 's nightgown in flames as she leapt from the window . . . and Evgenia hurrying her out the back door of the pavilion to Feodor and the waiting troika . " Mama ? . . . " Sasha had been talking to her as they got into the taxi , and Nicholas waved at the nurse who stood crying on the sidewalk . She was going to stay with friends , and had already had an offer of a job from the Van Alens in Newport . " Mama .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve insistently as Zoya gave the driver their new address , her eyes dull , her face wooden . She felt as though she were leaving Clayton again . . . the house they had shared . . . the life that had always been so easy . Ten years gone like the blink of an eye , an eye filled with tears now , as she longed for him again . She sat back against the seat and closed her eyes in pain , trying to concentrate on her children . " I 'm sorry , Sasha . . . what did you say ? " Her voice was a whisper as they left Sutton Place for the last time . Gone the beauty and the easy life that had ended so abruptly on that fateful day in October . " I said who is going to take care of us now ? " She was n't so much pained by the loss of her nurse , as she was curious about whop227would take care of her . It was all very strange and confusing , even for Nicholas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetheart . " " You are ? " Sasha looked amazed , and Nicholas looked at his mother with the gentle smile that always reminded her of Clayton . It was almost painful to see it now . Everything was a constant reminder of all they had lost , just as it had been in the days when they had first left Russia . " I 'll help you , Mama , " Nicholas said proudly , holding his mother'shand and trying not to cry . " I 'll take care of you and Sasha . " He knew it was what his father would have wanted of him , and he would n't let him down now . He was the man of the family suddenly . In one short month , his whole safe , happy world had been turned upside down , but he was determined to rise to the occasion , as was Zoya . She refused to be beaten once again . She would fight for them . . . she would work . . . and one day . . . one day . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't let her life end in defeat , like so many others . " Will you cook for us , Mama ? " Sasha asked as she took her doll from her mother and smoothed the hair . Her name was Annabelle , and she looked well loved . Her other dolls were waiting in the new apartment . Zoya had done everything she could to make the place look cozy and familiar , but there was nothing familiar to them about the ugly surroundings as the taxi stopped on West Seventeenth Street . Zoya shuddered as she looked around again , struck more than ever by how dismal it was , and Nicholas 's face registered shock as he followed his mother up the stairs , and tried not to feel sick from the awful smells . " Eghh . . . this smells ugly , " Sasha said as she walked up the stairs behind Zoya . The driver carried their bags for them , and Zoya paid him from their meager funds . She vowed to herself not to take any more taxis . They would travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more taxis , no more cars . She had sold the Hispano-Suiza to the Astors . Zoya showed them into the apartment 's single bedroom , and their two beds were there , dwarfing everything else . Their toys were arranged neatly beside them , and the paintings from Sasha 's nursery had been carefully hung over her bed . Next to Nicholas 's she had put a picture of Clayton , looking handsome in his uniform during the war . She had brought a suitcase filled with photographsp228of her own , of Clayton , and the children , and others that were yellowing and frayed , of Nicky and Alix , and the children at Livadia and Tsarskoe Selo . She had also brought the treasured imperial egg , it was carefully rolled into a pair of Clayton 's socks . She had brought a box of his cuff links and studs as well , but her own jewelry was going to be sold at auction . For those who still had money , there were fantastic opportunities everywhere , diamond necklaces and tiaras and incredible emerald rings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One family 's desperation would suddenly become another 's good fortune . " Where will you sleep , Mama ? " Nicholas looked worried again as he walked around the apartment , and realized there was only one bedroom . He had never seen quarters so small , even their servants on Sutton Place had had nicer rooms than these . The whole place looked so tiny and so ugly . " I 'm going to sleep here on the settee , my love . It 's very comfortable . " She smiled at him , and bent to kiss his cheek as she saw tears come to his eyes . It was n't fair , having to do this to the children , and she fought back a wave of the anger she had recently begun to feel for Clayton . Others had been wiser than he , less daring , and less foolish than he had been in risking all they had . And if only he had lived , they might have survived it differently .. . the two of them . . . they could at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now she was alone as she had never been before . It all rested on her shoulders now , as she realized it must have rested on Evgenia 's . And how brave she had been , how strong , it served as an example to Zoya now , as she looked at her son with a gentle smile , as he offered her his bed in the room he was to share with his sister . " You can have my bed , Mama . I will sleep here . " " No , darling . . . I 'll be fine . " And then with a brave smile , " We all will . Now , you must watch Sasha for me while I cook dinner . " She hung up their coats and her own , glad that she had brought warm clothes for them . The apartment was cold and there was n't even a fireplace as there had been in the apartment in Paris . " Why do n't you take Sava for a walk ? " The old dog was sitting quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home again , as they all were . Nicholas put her on the leash , and told Sasha to be good while he went downstairs and their mother cooked them the chicken shep229had brought from the house on Sutton Place . But she knew only too well that the provisions they had brought would n't last long , nor would their money . Christmas was a day like any other , except for the doll she bought Sasha and the pocket watch she 'd saved from Clayton 's things to give Nicholas . They huddled together as they bravely tried not to cry , and think of the enormity of their losses . The apartment was freezing cold , the cupboards were bare , and Zoya 's jewelry had gone at auction for pennies . She was determined to keep the imperial egg , but other than that , there was almost nothingleft , and she knew she had to find a job soon , but the question of where haunted her day and night . She thought of working in a shop , but she did n't want to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school , and she could n't leave her alone when Nicholas went to the public school nearby with the neighborhood children , most of whom were dressed in rags , and some of whom lived in shanties along the Hudson River . Shantytowns were springing up everywhere , filled with people who had once been stockbrokers and businessmen and lawyers . They cooked their meals in cauldrons on open fires , and they prowled the neighborhoodat night , looking for food , and discarded items they could use . It broke Zoya 's heart to see the children there , with their big hungry eyes and thin faces , their cheeks red from the cold , as they huddled near the fire to keep warm outside their shanties . It made the apartment seem like a haven in comparison , and she reminded the children of how much they had to be grateful for , almost daily . But even she had a hard time remembering that sometimes , as she watched their money dwindle , and began looking for a job in earnest . It would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were asleep , or at least safely at home . She knew she could trust Nicholas to take care of Sasha once he was home from school . He was responsible , and always kind to his little sister , sharing his games with her , helping her fix her toys , and talking endlessly about their father . The subject was still too painful for her , as she watched them and went back to the living room to cry silently , as she stroked ancient Sava . The little dog was almost blind now , and Nicholas had to carry her down the stairs , when he took her out into the bitter cold to walk her . It was January when Zoya walked from West Seventeenth Street all the way to Sixth Avenue at Forty-ninth Street , with a wildp230scheme . She knew it was crazy , but it was all she could think of . She had applied at several restaurants , but the proprietors had seen too many other women like her . What do you know about being a waitress ? they asked , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too refined to work the long hours for tiny wages . She had insisted that she could do it , but they had turned her away , and there was nothing else she knew how to do , except dance , but not in the ballet , as she had in Paris . More than once , in desperation , she had even considered prostitution , others had turned to that too , but she knew she could n't do it . The memory of Clayton was too strong and pure , he was the only man she had ever loved , and she could n't bear the thought of another man touching her , even to feed her children . Dancing was the only thing she knew , but she knew just as clearly that at thirty , she could not return to the ballet , after more than eleven years without dancing . She was still supple and lithe , but she was too old , and she felt a thousand years old , as she walked into the theater she had heard of . She had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't tall enough . So there was nothing left but to try the burlesque halls . It was five blocks south of the Ziegfeld Theater . Not surprisingly , when she walked through the stage door , the theater was filled with half-dressed women , whom she tried not to stare at while she looked for someoneshe could talk to . " Yeah ? " the woman in charge said , amused , " you a dancer ? " " I was . " " With who ? " She swallowed hard , knowing she looked too prim in her simple black Chanel dress . She should have worn something brighter and more racy , but she had sold all her evening clothes long since , and all she had were the somber , warm dresses she had salvaged from her closets at Sutton Place , the ones she knew she might have use for in the freezing cold apartment . " I danced with the Ballet Russe in Paris . I trained in Russia before that . " " A ballerina , eh ? " The thought seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her red hair pulled tightly back , her face without makeup . " Listen , lady , this ai n't a retirement home for old ballerinas . This is Fitzhugh 's Dance Hall ! " She said it with fierce pride , and Zoya felt a sudden surge of fury.  | " I 'm twenty-five , " she lied , " and I used to be very good . " " Yeah ? At what ? You ai n't done nothing like this before , I 'll bet . " That much was true , but she was willing to do anything to save her children . She remembered suddenly her audition for the Ballet Russe thirteen years before in Paris . " Let me try . . . just once . . . I can learn . . . please ... " Her eyes filled with tears in spite of herself , as a small round man with a cigar walked past , glancing at her only briefly and then shouting at two men carrying scenery between them . " Stupid jerks ! You 're gon na break that thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigar at the woman talking to Zoya . " Goddamn girls got the measles . . . can you beat that ? I 've got myself a bunch of old hoofers on my hands and they get sick like a bunch of goddamn kids . . . three of them out last week . . . seven more now . . . shit , what am I supposed to tell people paying good money to see the show ? That they can watch a bunch of broads with spots waving their asses at them . I 'd even do that if they 'd come to goddamn work . " He waved the cigar at Zoya and then beyond her , as though she did n't exist , and to him , she did n't . Without waiting for him to address her directly , she spoke up for herself , " I 'd like to audition for a job as a . The woman had thought she was French , in her expensivelycut black dress and her elegant airs . That was one thing they did n't need at Fitzhugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to look at her appraisingly but he did n't seem impressed . " Yes . " She decided to spare him the explanation . " A ballerina , " the other woman spoke up with obvious disdain . " You had the measles ? " he asked her . That was far more important to him with ten dancers out sick , and God only knew how many exposed and due to come down with it in the ensuing weeks . " Yes , I have , " she murmured as she prayed that she could still dance . Maybe she 'd forgotten everything . Maybe .. . He shrugged , and stuck the dead cigar back into his face . " Let her show you her stuff , Maggie . If she can stand up and do anything , she can stay till the others come back . " He left them then and the woman named Maggie looked annoyed . The last thing they needed was some fancy-assed , pale-faced broad who thoughtp232she was too good for a burlesque show . But he had a point , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , " she said reluctantly , and then shouted backstage . " Jimmy ! Get your ass out here and play ! " A black man with a broad smile appeared and looked at Zoya . " Hi , baby , what you want me to play ? " he asked her as he sat down at the piano . And she almost laughed in nervous terror . What could she say to him ? Chopin ? Debussy ? Stravinsky ? " What do you usually play for an audition ? " she asked him , and he smiled into her eyes . It was easy to see that she was high-class white folks fallen on bad times , and he felt sorry for her , with her big green eyes and wistful smile . She looked like a kid as she stood there , and he wondered if she 'd ever danced before . He had heard of others like her who 'd gone to work in nightclubs , doing acts they made up themselves , like Cobina Wright and Cobina Junior . " Where you from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Jimmy decided that he liked her . She smiled openly at him , still praying that she would n't make a fool of herself , but even the risk of that was worth it . " From Russia , a long time ago . I came here after the war . " And then he lowered his voice and glanced nervously over his shoulder . " You ever danced before , baby ? Tell me the truth , while Maggie ai n't listenin ' . You can tell Jimmy . I cai n't help you if I do n't know if you can dance . " " I was in the ballet when I was young . I have n't danced in eleven years , " she whispered back , grateful for his assistance . " My , my , my . . . " He shook his head in distress . " The Fitzhugh ai n't no ballet . . . " That was surely the understatement of the year , as two half-naked chorus girls wandered past them . " Look , " he said to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real slow , you just roll your eyes and smile , hop around a little bit , shake yo ' bum and show yo ' legs , and you gon na be just fine . You got a costume with you ? " But he knew from the look in her eyes , that she did n't . " I 'm sorry , I . . . " " Never mind . " And with that Maggie turned her attention to them again . " You gon na sit on your fat black ass all day , Jimmy , or are we going to do an audition ? Personally , I do n't give a damn , but Charlie wants me to see her do her stuff . " She looked malevolentlyp233at Zoya , as she prayed that she would n't fail dismally . But she followed his suggestions as he played and Charlie , the director , wandered past again , muttering as he watched her . He wanted her to hurry up so he could audition two new comedians and a stripper . " Shit . Just what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said it like the ultimate insult , " . . . Shake your ass . . . there , that 's it . . . let 's see those legs . . . more . . . " She hiked up her skirt as she blushed and continued to dance as Jimmy rooted for her . She had beautiful legs , and the grace that had come from thirteen years of dancing had never left her . " What are you for chrissake ? " The short fat man bellowed at her as she blushed , " A virgin ? People do n't come here to pray . They come here to watch broads dance . You think you can do that without looking like you just been raped ? " " I 'll try , sir . . . I 'll do my best .... " " Good . Then be back here tonight at eight o'clock . " Maggie stalked off in obvious disgust as he left , and Jimmy gave a cheer , and jumped up to give Zoya a hug . " Hey , Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you enough , " she shook his hand and her eyes thanked him warmly . " I have two children , I . . . we . . . " She was suddenly fighting back tears , as the old black man watched her , " I need the job very badly . . . " The tears spilled onto her cheeks as she wiped them away with embarrassed relief , unable to speak for a moment . " Do n't you worry . You gon na do just fine . See you tonight . " He smiled and went back to the card game he 'd been losing when Maggie called him . Zoya walked all the way home to the apartment , and thought about what she 'd done . Unlike her audition with the Ballet Busse years before , there was no feeling of victory and achievement . Just relief that she had a job and an overwhelming sense of embarrassment and degradation , but it was the only thing she could do , and it was at night , she would n't have to leave Sasha with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed like the perfect job , except that it was so awful . She explained to Nicholas that night that she had to go out . She did n't say why or where she was going . She did n't want to have to explain to him that she 'd taken a job as a chorus girl . The echo ofp234Charlie 's words still rang in her ear . . . " shake your ass . . . let 's see those legs .. . what are you ? A virgin ? . . . " To their way of thinking , she was . At almost thirty-one years of age , in spite of the hardships in her life , she had always been protected from people like him , and the people she was going to dance for . " Where are you going , Mama ? " " Out for a little while . " She had already put Sasha to bed . " Do n't stay up too late , " she admonished and kissed him , hugging him for a moment as though she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed in half an hour . " " When will you be back ? " He eyed her suspiciously from his bedroom door . " Later . " " Is something wrong , Mama ? " He was a perceptive child , and he was learning early about the cruel turns of fate that could change the course of a lifetime in a single moment . " No , nothing 's wrong , sweetheart . " She smiled at him then . " I promise . " At least they would have a little money . But she was in no way prepared for what it would be like , the crude jokes , the vulgar girls , the sleazy costumes , and the comedianswho pinched her behind as she hurried past them . But when the music began , and the curtain went up , she did her best for the jeering , laughing , excited crowd , and no one complained when she was out of step more than once . Unlike the Ballet Busse of long ago , here no one knew the difference . All they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bunch of pretty girls with most of their clothes off . There were sequins and beads , little satin shorts , and matching hats , and countless feather boas and huge headdresses . It was a cheap imitation of what the Ziegfeld girls wore , and more than once she silently bemoaned her fate at having been too short to be hired by the kindly Florenz Ziegfeld . Zoya gave her costumesback to the girl who had lent them to her , and she walked slowly home , with her stage makeup still on . She was even more shocked when a man scurrying past , offered her a nickel for " the best she could do for him , " in a nearby doorway . She ran the rest of the way home , with tears streaming down her face , thinking of the awful life that lay ahead of her at Fitzhugh 's Dance Hall . Nicholas was sound asleep when she got back and she kissed him gently , her lipstick smearing his cheek as she cried , thinking how sweet he looked as he slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was gone . . . that he had left her to this . . . if only he had known . . . if only . . . but it was too late for that . She tiptoed back into the living room where she slept , took her makeup off and changed into her nightgown . Gone the silks and satins and laces . She had to wear heavy flannel gowns against the bitter cold of the barely heated apartment . And in the morning , she made Nicholas breakfast before he left for school . There was a glass of milk , a slice of bread , and a single orange she had bought the day before , but he never complained . He only smiled at her and patted her hand , and hurried off to school , after kissing Sasha . And that night she went back to the theater again , as she did for the next weeks until the dancers returned from their measles . But when they did , Charlie gruffly told her they 'd keep her on , she had good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jimmy bought her a beer to celebrate , purloined from his favorite speakeasy nearby . She thanked him and took a sip not to hurt his feelings . She did n't tell him that it was her thirty-first birthday . He was always kind to her , the only friend she had there . The others had sensed instantly that she was " different . " They never shared their jokes with her , in fact they barely talked to her , as they told tales of their boyfriends , and the men who followed them backstage . More than one of them ran off with men who offered them a little money . It was what Charlie liked about her . She was n't much fun to have around , but at least she was steady . They gave her a raise after the first year . She could n't believe herself that she had stayed that long , but there was no way out , nowhere else to go , and no one who would pay her . She told Nicholas that she danced with a small ballet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything happened . But she thanked God he never called her . And sensing that she was ashamed of what she did , he never asked to go to a performance . And for that , and all his little tendernesses toward her , she was always grateful . One night Sasha had woken up with a cough , and a fever , and Nicholas was waiting up for her , but he had n't wanted to call her at the theater and worry her . In every way , he was a help to her and an enormouscomfort . " Will we ever see our old friends again ? " he asked her quietly one afternoon , as she cut his hair , and Sasha played with Sava . " I do n't know , sweetheart . " She 'd had a letter from their **27;16049;TOOLONG the men . My mother seized hold of me , and swore she would die first on the roadside , and my father could not gainsay her . We were one hour in the Swinford workhouse , and t was a great shame in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cottage in Haslingden , but never to a stranger . " He snapped his fingers at a passing waiter . " A pot of tea , if you please , and a round or two of sandwiches would go well , this time of night . Some ham and some chicken ; mix them up . " " Yes , " the waiter said , " straight away , Mr. Davitt , sir . " Suddenly Davitt began to laugh , and setting down his glass , he slapped the flat of his hand on the table . " But only in Gaelic . We would only speak of our disgrace in Gaelic  --  our own tongue , but fit only for misfortunes , dirt , shame . By God , I hold it no shame . The shame is upon a land that will put women and children upon the roads , homeless . It was as well for us , perhaps . There are six hundred buried in a mass grave in the fields beyond Swinford workhouse , and naught but a plaque to mark the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something close to it , in your own county . It is one thing to see it , and another to have no food , to see children of your own and they starving . It was the sight that my father and mother saw , before they saw Liverpool . Mind you , to write down what has been seen so that all may feel it . It is a rare gift . " He put his hand on Bob 's forearm , for it was Bob he was speaking of , whose accounts in Christmas in the Boggeraghs , in that winter of ' seventy-nine , had been given wide circulation by the League . Bob shrugged . " Hughie here was with me , and indeed the fine literary touches , as you might call them , were stuck in by Hughie . " I did not gainsay him . Bob had a forceful , driving style when he set pen to paper , and a lawyer 's gift for marshalling arguments and facts . But you would not be inclined to call him a belle-lettrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretches driven week by week farther towards starvation which made the articles a sombre wonder , and all that was of Bob 's composition , as was the battering indictment of BartholomewColthurst , the landlord of those barren hillsides . The descriptions were mine , stuck in at Bob 's request  --  the bleak , wintry horizons , the mud cabins within which families huddled gaunt and ragged , the bailiffs and emergency men with their battering rams . What I had brought back with me from the dreadful day that we had spent in the Boggeraghs was a pedlar 's bundle of colours , odours , noises , the sense of a misery and despair deeper than words . But if men were roused to anger by the articles , it was surely by Bob 's hard proof that the system by which land was held could on occasion be a form of persecut ion and nmtslaughtcr.  | " I remember those fine literary touches , " Davitt said . " Perhaps you have missed your calling , Mr. MacMahon . " " I have not , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature to be a schoolmaster . " " With time out for a rising and a term in prison . " " A few hours of the one , " I said , " and a few months of the other . That glutted my appetite for heroism . " " I can believe that , " Davitt said . What must they have been like , those seven years served out of a sentence of fifteen ? Unimaginable . A mechanical existence  --  slops , iron bars , shuffling gait of the exercise yard . " Two years ago , " Davitt said , " in ' seventy-nine , when the League commenced , we were hard-pressed for intelligent men , resourceful men , to act as agents . Recruits like Bob here were rare enough in those days . T is far different now . The League is on the move ; we are an organization more feared by the English than ever O'Connell 's Association was . And , what is more to the point , feared by the landlords , as O'Connell never was , a landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brave words . " " Mr. Parnell is himself a landlord , " I said , trusting that my tone was a mild one , " with fine farms and rolling pasturelands above in Wicklow . " " He is , " Davitt said , unperturbed , " but he has not swerved a jot in his fight for the tenants and the small farmers . There is one difference between Parnell and O'Connell , and I could name others . " It was a fair answer . We are a curious people , as has been remarked often . The very cornerstone of the movement which Parnell and Davitt had hammered together , the two of them , fox-hunting gentleman and Fenian gaolbird , was that of war to the hilt against the landed proprietors , and yet was not Charles Parnell himself Parnell of Avondale , the master of broad acres , in the newspaper phrase , carved out by a Cromwellian 's sword ? And this delighted us , if truth be told . A race of snobs , every last one of us , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fawning before their new English masters , to the leader writers of our patriotic press . Davitt was one of us , but Parnell was apart , remote , cool . " My point , Mr. MacMahon , " Davitt said , " is that the Land League has no shortage of helpers in these latter days , but I have a preference for men I can be certain of , men like Bob here , and men of whom Bob is certain . " " I take your point , Mr. Davitt , and I am honoured by it , " I said . " But I have had my full share of public life , my few hours and my six months . I wish you well and I wish your cause well . When a hand is needed inp302Kilpeder to carry a torch for a League procession , or to help with the scaffolding at a meeting , you can depend upon me . But there you are . " " Yes , " Davitt said , and smiled with courtesy , shrugging his good shoulder . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in those early triumphant years of the League , although later Bob would again find a use for me . But that night was in the great , rousing years of the early eighties , which none of us in the seventies  --  in the years when the children came to Mary and myself , in the years of Bob and Agnes establishing themselves , and of Vincent 's colourful , disreputable adventures  --  none of us anticipated . But there now is one of those tricks which history plays , not upon ordinary people but upon historians . I have noticed it in Patrick Prentiss . In the history books , whether of the national or of the loyal persuasion , the seventies are spoken of as the quiet years , the silent years , the years of preparation , or some such rubbish ; for historians are hostile as though upon instinct towards quietude , silence , seasons , the stars . For them , the League , the boycottings , Parnell 's coming into command , the land acts , the final explosion into bitterness and division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of history . And yet , looking backward , I see the slow seed time of the seventies . We all see , perhaps , what we want to see . Bob , I think , was a man unburdened by history , quick and brisk , ready to decide and to act . Ned , too , believed that he had flung history aside , but he had not ; it dogged his steps , a mongrel , sharp-toothed and slavering . It is fellows like myself , perhaps , quiet men who have made no covenants with history , who live most fully within it , and it is the quiet times , the silent decades , that we savour : the growth of children , the entanglements year by year of our outspreading memories , unpruned . Thus , were I to look back upon the decade , the great event leaping before the screen of recollection would not be brought to me by newspaper or pamphlet , would not point , save ironically , towards the future . It would be the return to Ardmor Castle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sylvia Challoner . They had been awaited for days , and word was sent ahead that they were taking the coach road north from Cork , having landed the night before in Queenstown . Their tenants had built bonfires along the ridges , high above the road as it leads into Kilpeder , and when the coach was sighted , at a distance , the fires were lighted . It was not quite night then , but the pale far edge of the evening , and the flames burned pale against the sky . From my parlour window , looking beyond Saint Jarlath 's , I could see two of thep303fires , rising high and narrow as a sharp breeze took them . Curious that a few of the Ardmor tenants had been Fenians , on the run in those hills , and now their brothers were tending fires of welcome for a landlord 's bride . I stood by the window for what must have been a long time , walking once into the kitchen to tell Mary what I was about , but she declined to join me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lights lit in the town , and the hillside fires fierce , red , leaping . Presently I heard shouts , and walked outside my door and down the path . The Ardmors were arriving , of course , by the west road , and would not be passing my door . Half the town , at least , had hurried down to the gates , and stragglers were now afoot to join them . I myself walked a bit of the way , that I might have the gates in view . There were fellows standing outside the doors of Conefry 's , pints of porter in hand , and shawled women , in their twos and threes , laughing and chattering , walked past the shops . At the far end of the square , at the gates , where the crowd had gathered , were lighted tar barrels , casting upon the scene lights at once lurid and festive . A sense of position held me tethered : not for schoolmaster , any more than for auctioneer or solicitor , to swell a progress , although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now , at that moment , marked by a shout from the people at the gates , and a moment later , I could see the carriage itself , an open carriage despite the chill of the evening , and the two tall-hatted coachmen . The two seated figures were indistinct , tarry flames creating a flickering illusion of greys , roses , shadows . Through the gates the coach trundled , and into darkness , although , far off , where the rise of the park moved towards the castle , above river , above plantations , terraces , light fell from tall , distant windows . There was nothing left to be seen by the watchers at the gate , but they seemed reluctant to leave , lingering by tar-barrel warmth , their voices , jovial , floating back towards me . It was a fairy-tale hour . From Perrault , perhaps , rather than Grimm , and not text but tall-volumed engraving : past peasants , past castle gates , through enchanted woods , dark , mysterious , a young nobleman bears homewards his lovely bride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lord and Lady Ardmor themselves , nor to the sensible townspeople of Kilpeder , welcoming a bit of frolic , torches and tar barrels , beacon fires on the hills , and no harm done if a shout for the landlord were thrown into the bargain . It would be different in a half-dozen years , when the Land War was upon us , and fellows standing this night at the gate , bawling their lungs out , would indignantly and honestly deny that ever they had cheered so showy an instrument of oppression as the I ' : arl of Ardnur . Their fathers , perhaps ,  |p304or  their grandfathers more likely , obedient serfs . But not them . Such are the ways and uses of memory . Although it would be more difficult for them to expunge from recollection 's slate the great festivities of a few weeks later , with the barns thrown open for dancing , and barrels beyond number of porter and stout , and all the grounds of the Castle free for the people of Kilpeder to wander about in , the deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the terraces and the ornamental gardens themselves , which had been the pride of the old countess , much remembered and loved . The shadows of a late spring afternoon darkened slowly , the heavy-branched elms of the river path stretching across darkening water , and the air filled with voices . In the barns long tables groaned beneath hams and chickens , cakes thick-coated with icings , slices of barmbrack slathered with butter . At night , after the dancing had commenced , the Earl and his countess came out upon the library terrace , where , their being seen , a great shout went up , and the dancing was suspended , dancers and musicians rushing out , standing upon the lawns , black by now save where made bright by splashes of light . The Earl splendid in evening dress , and his lady seeming , as more than once in those years she did , as queens are imagined to look in  --  as I have said before  --  fairy tales . One of the fiddlers began then to play , an air which I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so skilful the musician 's art , that all other sounds ceased , save for kitchen clatter . The notes floated up towards husband and bride , floated towards tree-branched river , smooth-grassed deer park where , invisible , slept Kilpeder 's famous herd . Presently , there being nothing more to see , the townspeople turned away from the demesne gates , falcon-guarded , and made their ways home . As I did myself . For a while I sat reading ; it was , as I remember distinctly , the spring and summer that I made my way through all of Don Quixote , all seven volumes of it in the set which I had found , a great bargain , in Cork City , in the translation by Motteux , the pages uncut , the paper of excellent quality although yellowed a bit at the edges , and an engraving prefacing each volume , the mad skinny knight , dagger-bearded , and his shrewd , clownish servant , in some new , ludicrous misadventure.  |p305I  was visiting with the Emersons , in Limerick , when the note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Italy , and would be expecting me at Kilpeder . They had been away far too long , for my tastes , but we had several times missed each other narrowly , in Paris once , and in London , and I had been staying in Venice but a week before their arrival there . Tom wrote to me from Venice , a long , inconsequential , charming letter . They had taken the Casa Donati , which I knew well  --  its exterior at least : a gaunt , battered , attractive house on the Canal , just at the bend below the Rialto . He sent me sketches he had made , standing on their balcony : the palazzi across the Canal , gondolas , a distant glimpse of the Salute and the Custom House . The usual stuff of Venetian pilgrimage , no doubt , but all done in that new manner of his  --  swift impressions , puzzling at first , pen darts and blobs of ink , but then becoming clear , precise , but never , deliberately perhaps , vivid . I have saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with Venice and with each other , Tom wrote . There was a sketch also of Sylvia , this one in watercolours , not ink . She is standing on the balcony , in a salmon-coloured gown , cut low , but with a mantle of white lace flung over her shoulders , and she bends forward , both hands resting upon the marble railing , looking across the water , down the length of the Canal . It is late afternoon , so one would judge , slanting sunlight colouring water , stone , stucco . The technique which Tom used is by now a commonplace , but it was novel then  --  bold blocks of colour poised against each other . Even this sketch , an hour 's work , perhaps , as he sat beside her on the balcony , has the energy of an argument . I do not speak from memory , for this sketch is not God knows where , but framed , hanging in my bedroom . Her face is half in shadow , half in the heavy , Venetian light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to West Cork , the Emersons perhaps not all that unhappy to see me off , for I had been with them almost a fortnight , working with Jack on the small yacht which he kept at Kilrush , sailing her past Scattery Island , past Carrigaholt and Killbaha , and beyond the Shannon into the Atlantic . I felt light , unburdened , weightless ; Jack is a skilful sailor , and there was little for me to do save haul on a line when he shouted to me . Passing out of Ireland and onto the open sea in that way is a curious experience . Looking back , towards Loop Head and Kerry Head , the country 's intense green comes almost as a shock . Returning , if evening has come  --  an evening of mist and tenuous , frayed fog  --  the light at Loop Head seems a blurred luminescence , soft and welcoming . I was careful not to expound upon this to Jack , a hardheaded excise man who regards art and poetry as rubbish . One of the Ardmor Castle traps was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leathery , taciturn groom named Leahy , his boots and top hat dusty and his dress negligent . He had brought with him sandwiches and a bottle of Sancerre , packed in a hamper . A note , tied to its wicker handle , said , " Welcome home to Kilpeder . Love , Sylvia . " And at the Castle itself , it was Sylvia rather than Tom who was the first to greet me . We had swung through the gates , and were riding down the long avenue , sun-dappled , when she came riding straight at us , across the meadows and through the trees , sitting a heavy chestnut mare , in a riding habit of dark green , a forest 's colour . When she reached us , she swung the mare round , and Leahy halted the trap . " Welcome home to Kilpeder , " she said , as she had written on the note . I had seen her last in Westmeath , at the wedding , when she had looked as all brides look , white-gowned , radiant for the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had , in courtesy towards us all , subdued herself to the role she played . But now she was herself , and this was my first clear sight of her . She held herself as though vain of her figure , and she had reason to be , a woman far more slender than fashion then preferred , but erect , thin-waisted , sitting her mount with easy confidence . She was bareheaded , and her hair was undone , falling loose upon the shoulders of the green jacket , and disordered after her ride across the fields . I made to climb down from the trap , but she put her hand on my arm . " Later , " she said . " Let us ride up to the Castle . We will surprise Tom . And so we rode along together , pleasurably . " Over there , " she said , pointing across the meadows with her crop . " That is where Tom and I intend to make a kind of Japanese-y garden , with a stream and a little bridge and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , puzzled . In a few years ' time , half of London would be mad for things Japanese , but not yet . " Oh , yes , " Sylvia said . " And it will be mine , Tom says . When next you visit Kilpeder , I shall give you both tea in my teahouse , but you must ask my permission to come in , because it will be entirely mine , and not part of Ardmor at all . " " There is an engraving hanging in the estate office , " I said . " It says that the town of Kilpeder , all of it , belongs to the Earl of Ardmor . " " And so it may , for all I care , but not the teahouse and the Japanese garden . They will belong to me . " " You could affix a plaque , " I said . " Property of the Countess of Ardmor . ' " " No , " she said . " It will say , This is Sylvia 's . ' " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the avenue took its sudden turn towards the curved carriageway , and brought Ardmor Castle into view . Late spring , moving toward summer : it is the loveliest of Ardmor 's seasons , so many think . So Isabel , Tom 's mother , thought , and she it was who created the formal gardens , artfully arranging their blooms to move through all of summer 's months , week by week . It was past the first tier of gardens , the lowest tier , that we were riding now , and I was taken by distant colours  --  pink , vermillion , rose , yellow . " The gardens are always lovely , " I said . " Always even lovelier than one remembers them . " " Yes , " she said , a hit abruptly . " Look , there 's Tom . At the portico . His hack is to us ; he does n't know we are here . " She touched her cropp308to her mare 's flank , and bolted ahead , leaving Leahy and myself to jog along behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hand on his forearm . With his free arm , he embraced me , and then held me off by its length , pretending to study me . " You seem unchanged , " he said . " Does he not , Sylvia ? " " You are the one who should have changed , " I said to him . The long hall seemed bare , and Tom caught my puzzlement . " I have taken down all those paintings that have hung there for donkey 's years , " he said , " all those Forresters dead and gone , in scarlet uniforms . And all those views of Flemish meadows painted with gravy . I am having the hall repainted , and then hung with paintings I have found in Paris , and one or two of my own , perhaps . Does that seem awful of me ? I 'll hang our ancestors somewhere else , of course . I wo n't banish them to a lumber room . " You can for all of me , " I said . " You were painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bride ? " " He was most attentive , " Sylvia said . " He painted me , and not the Bridge of Sighs or Saint Mark 's . " She turned towards him . " Tom , you should speak to Griffin about the groom who met Lionel . Leahy , is n't it ? His collar was a mess , and his boots caked with mud . " Tom smiled at me . " This is n't London , my dear . It is n't even Dublin . Lee was n't offended , were you ? " But before I could answer , she said , " No , but your next visitor might be . If you dressed him in a tweed jacket and a billycock hat , it might not matter , but if you want him in livery , you should make certain that he wears it properly . " It was a sensible enough objection , and yet it jarred a bit against an earlier image , a girl riding towards me across meadows . " You have spent too long in London , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never forgot Ireland , " she said , and smiled . " Nor that I am Irish . I was not let forget it . " Her Ireland , Westmeath , was almost ours , although not quite . Her father , old Hubert , retired colonel , had opened up the house for the wedding , an older house than Ardmor , but much smaller . Queen Anne , warm red brick , two small drawing rooms almost bare of furniture . There must have been bad management in the Challoner family , several generationsof it , to have ended up with a mortgaged estate in the richest farming county in Ireland , the soil heavy , and the grasses thick . Mortgaged , or else rented up to the walls of the demesne . But I Iuhcrt had hadp309to have his army : all the Challoners had been soldiers . He was not your stock , Punch colonel , but rather a frail , delicate man , thin-boned  --  an elegant man , in truth  --  and his wife was as attractive , a poised woman with pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost black , like Sylvia 's . But they had lived so long in London , or abroad , that they seemed almost strangers in their own reopened house . One morning , a few days before the wedding , I had come upon Challoner in the dining room , standing by the window looking out over the fields , towards where , just at the horizon 's edge , the sun glinted upon lake water . " Good country here , " he said to me . " Good land , is n't it , Forrester ? " As though reminding himself , both pride and regret in his tones . His hair was silver , soft , brushed with care . But once , no doubt , it had been dark . Sylvia 's hair must have come from him . " Tea ? " Tom said to me . " Or a whiskey ? " " Why do n't we have both ? " Sylvia said . " And in the library . " And so we did . The tea took a time to arrive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as heavy a measure for herself as for us , pouring with a man 's confidence from the heavy Waterford decanter , and then seating herself on the broad arm of Tom 's chair , so that we faced each other . " To Lionel , " she said , " to Tom 's great friend Lionel , " and she held up her glass . " No , no , " I said , " the toast should be mine . To the two of you . And my blessings . " " His blessings , " she said , and sipped . Tom put his arm about her waist , and looked up at her , at her profile . She was looking straight at me , and smiling . Light from the evening sun spilled through the tall windows , across the lovely , faded carpet , white , pink , pale blue , and touched the shelves of tall books unread for decades , perhaps never read . Turf in the deep fireplace was ready for lighting , great blocks from the bog , dark and fibrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's house , than my rooms in London . I remembered Isabel in this room . She was a startling woman . Whenever someone describes Sylvia , he should begin with that word , for it is surely in his mind . Now , here in this room , the green riding habit gave her a dramatic presence . She sat poised on the chair arm , a slender woman but not at all a small one  --  tall , rather , and heavy-boned . She sat with back arched , Tom 's arm encircling her , and one leg stretched forward , almost indecorously , the riding boot a glossy black . She held the whiskey glass in her two hands . " A Japanese garden , " she said . " I have been telling Lionel . It will he the first Japanese garden in West Cork . "  | " You may depend upon that , " I said . " And I shall serve tea there in the Japanese manner , " she said . " We shall kneel upon straw mats , and I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is a very formal ceremony , I have been told , " I said . " And wrapped in Eastern mystery . " " All form , " Tom said . " No mystery . " " Mr. Whistler would not agree , " she said . " I can not make out Tom 's notion of art at all , " she said to me , " can you ? I was certain , when first he showed me his paintings , that he would be a great admirer of Mr. Whistler , but not at all . " " I like them well enough , " Tom said , " but it is not what I have in mind for myself . He is coming from another direction . " " From the East , " she said , " from Japan . And not Paris . " Tom smiled and shook his head . " All that is nonsense , and he knows it . It is a game he plays . He is an elaborate man and plays elaborate games . He learned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was still unpersuaded by Tom 's new existence as artist . He was playing a game himself , like Whistler . But Whistler was also the genuine article . I had encountered him a dozen times at least , in one drawing room or another , one salon or another , a ridiculous dandy , spruce and corseted , with an affected way of standing and walking , and a sackful of epigrams contrived in advance . But he was the genuine article  --  a true artist , as I would never be a true writer . Nor Tom a true painter  --  as at first I foolishly supposed . And why need he be , an earl , with broad acres , and this extraordinarywoman as his bride ? " Have you met Mr. Whistler ? " she said . " Mr. Whistler and I are great friends . " " You are fortunate in your friends , " I said . " He is a remarkable man . Very witty . " Tom gave me a sarcastic look . He was familiar with my evasions . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month with one friend , a fortnight with another , you developed strategies , codes , private ironies . " Yes , " she said . " Did you know , we will give a grand ball . That wonderful ballroom will be used again for the first time in  --  how long , Tom , how many years ? It looks so sad , Lionel , that great , bare box of a room , and sheets over the mirrors . We will have a grand ball , for all of our neighbours here , and people from Meath and Kilkenny and Wicklow and Dublin , and perhaps from London as well . They will stay for clays and days and there will be paper lanterns in the gardens . " " A long , long time , " Toni said to me , and I knew at once what hep311meant . A long , long time since we had sat together on the stairs , schoolboys , and heard the music , the babble of voices . " But first , " Tom said , " and straightaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual thing for the tenants and the Kilpeder people . A pity , Sylvia , that your teahouse is n't ready for them . Farmers like nothing better than a good cup of tea . " " Do n't mock them , " she said . " Or me . I think it is all wonderful , like a fairy tale . Lord and Lady Ardmor . The Earl and Countess of Ardmor . At your coming-of-age , was there a celebration ? " " I was away then , " Tom said . " At Cambridge . Kilpeder was troubled then . They were troubled times . " " Troubled ? " she said . Mrs. Ledwich came in then with the tea , as I had remembered it from my childhood , in the service which had been a wedding gift to Tom 's grandparents , and with plates of sandwiches , wider and thicker than they would have been in England . " Where are you from this time , Mister Lionel ? " she said . " Greece , is it , or the North Pole ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limerick . With Jack Emerson . " Limerick , " she said . " God help us . I was once in Rathkeale . " " Nearer at hand than Wicklow , " Sylvia said . " But we were in Wicklowlast month , Lionel . At the Cardews . Do you know them , Lionel ? He was at Cambridge with Tom . " I shook my head . " A decent , empty-headed fellow , with a fine pack of hounds , " Tom said . " There was another Cambridge chap staying with him . Charles Parnell , another great rider to hounds . He is thinking about Parliament , no less . In Isaac Butt 's party . " " Yes , " I said . " Butt has a decent lot with him there , " and thought no more of it . To my best recollection , that is how I first heard Parnell 's name , that casually , a huntsman staying with a Wicklow chap named Cardew . In a few years ' time , no one in Ireland would hear it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a familiar one , and spoken nearly always with affection , whatever one 's political allegiance . It was in Parliament , in fact , that I had seen him last , when I had called in to hear a hmnourous friend deliver a dull speech . I met Butt in the lobby : we knew each other slightly . One 's affection for him began with his appearance , a plump man , below the middle height , a shock of disordered white hair , clothes carelessly worn , and a ready smile which did not play only aboutp312his lips , but lit up his eyes . He had a mischievous wit , without malice . He had had a few glasses too many that night . He often did  --  that was his failing , as everyone said , that and women . Between the two , they kept him teetering always on the edge of calamity . He joked about it . " The bailiffs , " he would say , " the bailiffs and myself have become the best of friends . Old familiars . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And why not , they spend more time in it . " " He is very handsome , your Mr. Parnell , " Sylvia said . " Not my Parnell , " Tom said . " We have met a few times . We were together at Cambridge . Not my crowd , though . Hunted together a few times . Typical Wicklow squire , I would have thought him . Not Butt 's sort at all . " " What is Butt 's sort ? " Sylvia asked . " Who is Butt ? " " A barrister , " I said , " and a very able one . Or at least he was . And until a few years ago , a leader of the Orange gang , High Church , High Tory . And then he turned round completely , began working for amnesty for the Fenian prisoners , began something he calls Home Rule , to give us a tinpot legislature of our own , here in Dublin . He has formed his own little party , twenty members or so . Every so often one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech on behalf of Ireland . Harmless stuff , and some of his fellows are most amusing . " " But that is splendid of him , " Sylvia said , as she poured . " Why do you mock them ? " " You keep yourself well informed , Lee , " Tom said . " You are quite right , Sylvia , " I said . " It was wrong of me . Someone , God knows , should speak for this poor ramshackle country , and Butt has eloquence ; he is no demagogue , no beggarman like O'Connell . " " And now handsome Mr. Parnell , the huntsman , aspires to be with him , " Sylvia said . " But not a very impressive addition to the ranks , despite his appearance , " Tom said . " I should have thought him a Tory , a huntin ' , shootin ' Tory squire . " " Butt was a Tory once , " I said . " And a fellow in his party told me once that Kilpeder played its part in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard nothing of that . " " Butt took on the defence of some of the Fenians , in ' sixty-five and again in ' sixty-seven , at the Rising . Simple matter of the law ; he had no sympathy for them . And there was n't very much that he could do for them , although he did his best . Rebels in arms , not much material there for a defence . He defended some of the leaders , and a few of the rank  |p313and  file . He appeared for Edward Nolan , the man who led the attack on Kilpeder . " Sylvia said , puzzled , " The attack on this Kilpeder ? Here ? " " Oh yes , " Tom said . " This Kilpeder . The attack and my coming-ofage . I was in Cambridge for both of them . I have been left out of history . But Lee was here ; Lee saw the Fenian rising . " " Here in the Castle , that is , " I told her . " There was little enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , towards the very end , there was a glimpse of the soldiers moving along the crest of the Macroom road , at the end of the town . " " How thrilling , " Sylvia said . " Were you all terrified , all of you here at the Castle ? " I took her question seriously , and tried to answer it . I remembered Isabel and myself on the terrace , beyond the windows of the room which now held us , Tom and Tom 's bride and myself . Eight years before , no great chasm of time ; and yet it also seemed locked away in an unrecoverablepast . There had been snow on the terrace , and the day had had a winter 's clarity . " No , " I told her , " not terrified at all . It all seemed to be at a great distance from us , from the Castle . It had been expected , you know  --  not that it would be here at Kilpeder , but that there would be a rising that spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet we all knew , somewhere within us we all knew , that it would collapse . Even the Fenians knew that , I think . " " They knew it , " Sylvia said , " and yet they attacked . They went into rebellion . " " The wretched little affair here was one of their set-pieces , " I said . " Men were killed . Fenians , a constable . Blood spilled . But a pattern for what happened across the country . " " But these were local people ? " Sylvia said . " Your tenants ? Thepeople who lit bonfires for us and cheered us at the gates ? " " And will be coming round for the celebration , " Tom said . " Not the very people , perhaps , but their brothers and aunts and fathers . " " Chute would know more about that than either of us , " I said . " Youshould talk with him if it interests you . " " I will , " Sylvia said , with a show of exaggerated decisiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our very doorstep , and the two of you know next to nothing about it . " And the talk drifted off then to other matters , Venice perhaps , or friends we had in common . Or perhaps Tom and I told her the bits and  |p314|pieces  that we knew  --  Isabel and myself on the terrace , gunfire . Told her perhaps that the local schoolmaster had been one of the rebels , and the assistant iii the town 's big shop . But perhaps we did not . Sylvia was at the time less interested than she pretended . She was teasing us . No doubt shethought herself Irish , as we all did ; but most of her life had been lived in London , with holidays at home . Being Irish was a plume for her hat , and what more Irish than faint , harmless echoes of a failed rebellion ? I stayed with them almost six weeks on that visit . Spring became summer , the elms along my favorite walk , beside the river , heavy with thick leaf , crowding out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom worked and while I should have been at work , my manuscript lying , half finished , on the library table . It was another of my books of travel , the one on Spain , and had been promised to my publisher for that autumn . But talking with Sylvia was like visiting another country . The demesne wall lies just on the far side of the river , and we heard noises from the town  --  shouts , the creak of cart wheels , Saint Jarlath 's booming bell . It was in those weeks that I discovered Sylvia , as one discovers a country . Or thought I did . Once we were sitting on a backed bench , about halfway down the avenue of trees , the morning air light and cool . " Tom and I were not properly introduced , you know , " she said . " We met at Galantiere 's studio . The artist , you know . Every Wednesday and every Thursday , he would have people in for tea , but it was more often punch . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course Tom was in Paris , much of his time . " " And the army before that , " I said . " But then I would have been much too young , " she said . " I can not imagine Tom as a soldier . He would have been handsome  --  was he hand-some ? " " Handsome enough , I expect . Like Parnell . " " I like handsome men , " she said , in her mock-decisive way . " It is a common prejudice , " I said . " I have suffered under it . " " You , Lionel ! " she said . " You are something better than handsome . You are . . . " She hesitated for a word . " Interesting ' is the usual evasion , " I said . " It is not an evasion , " she said . " It is precisely right . You interest people , and it begins with how you look . " It would have seemed , in any other young wife , flirtatiousness , butnot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their gaze , unsettlingbut not flirtatious . She was an unsettling woman . I liked her . " Tom is fortunate , " she said , " to have so good a friend as you . Thereis no one to whom I feel as close as you two seem to be . " A magpie sprang from one of the trees across the river and flew over our heads , towards a copse . And once we picnicked , the two of is , taking a jaunting car outp315through the gates and up towards the Derrynasaggarts , a day now of full summer , with a haze upon the horizon , but the streams clear and sparkling , and the grasses a deep , fathomless green . We spread out our cloth in a meadow , beneath an oak , and from hampers Sylvia took out china , silver , glasses . Chablis was the colour of straw . Her summer frock was unbuttoned at the throat , and her flesh was clear , pale . She wore a hat of wide-brimmed straw , fastened beneath her chin with a ribbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took it off , and rested it beside her , on the grass . The frock spread out , a pattern of small flowers , pale green , pale pink . " Whose meadow is this ? " she asked . " Is this Tom 's ? Our meadow ? " " Good Lord , Sylvia , " I said . " How should I know ? Ask Chute . Perhaps not . We are not the only landlords , you know  --  far from it . I think Tom 's lands stretch northwards from the town , beyond Clonbrony Wood , in that direction . But there are scattered lands in all directions . This might be Tom 's . " " Ask Chute , " she said . " That is what Tom always tells me . It must be strange , not to know what you own . With us , it was the other way round . We knew exactly what we used to own , what we had sold off . " " And I , " I said , " have never had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Tom , of course . " " On days like these , " she said , " Father and I would walk the roads which spread out from the house . He carried a strange stick that he had brought back from one of those places  --  the Punjab I think  --  all twisted and warty , black as sin . We would pause at the rise of a hill , and he would hold the stick out before him , sweeping it in a great arc . And do you know , it was not the loss of the land or the rents that he lamented . It was losing so much of his stake here , so much of this country . " We are a curious people , we Anglo-Irish , English-in-Ireland , however you may want to call us . I could see Hubert Challoner from Sylvia 's words , for I had seen dozens like him  --  soldiers , dons , colonial judges , traders in half the ports of China and the Levant , faces and necks burned red or brown . Soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their home the regimental mess , their traditions the traditions of the regiment . Call them Irish in the wrong tone of voice and there would be hell to pay . But for each there is a remembered scene  --  a copse , a freshet , a tumbled fence , or the music of an early morning , birdsong in clear , pale silence . Over the years , the estate will be sold off bit by bit , a farm to pay for a string of Indian ponies , a farm to see a daughter presented at Court or ; a son live at Oxford in proper style . Years can go by without a returnp316to Ireland , or even a wish to . But in the end they come back , the rememberedscene unfaded , unfindable , and with a bit of cash , a bit of luck , they will find a hunting lodge , rechristen it " Simla " or " Khyber Pass . " The local news will not please them . A neighbour 's son has turned Catholic in order to marry one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffians , Whiteboys , desperadoes . But on russet mornings , the hunt will wed them again to the land , at a race meeting , shouts , pounding hooves , a knot of peasants standing by a stall , a sudden wind ; suddenly they will know that they are home again , that they have come home . We are not Irish , we Anglo-Irish , so the nationalist newspapers tell us . But Sylvia , as she sat facing me , her dark eyes looking a bit past me , towards the hills , seemed not to have come from the world of Hubert Challoner , or from my world , or Tom 's . " Tom and his art , " she said abruptly . " It is very strange , is it not ? We expect people to be what the world expects of them . A landlord should be a landlord , or a soldier , perhaps , or a member of Parliament . Not a painter . " " No , " I said . " Does that disturb you ? " " Disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . I think it is wonderful . I wish that I could paint or draw or sketch , but all I make are wretched daubs . I envy him . " " These painters he admires so , these Frenchmen of his , I have heard them called wretched daubers . " " Do n't you believe it , " she said with such fierce energy that I smiled at her . " They are changing the world , those Frenchmen of his . " " Art does not change the world , " I said . " Nothing changes the world . The world changes itself , and there is nothing we can do about it . " " Well then , " she said , " they are changing the way in which we see the world . Will you settle for that ? " " Gladly , " I said , " although I am not sure that you are right . I do n't myself see the world differently because of those chaps . I 'm damned if I do . " " Now there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know there is , " I told her . " I know him . Do n't tell me that Paul Galantiere is going to change the world , because I will not for one minute believe you . " He was a society painter , a portraitist , with a skilful but , so it seemed to me , a showy technique , theatrical , masses of blacks and whites offset with single , dramatic splashes of colour , the crimson velvet of a rose , a yellow sash , a decoration . And I may perhaps have been unfair to him , because he was in truth changing the way in which people iii that worldp317of his saw each other , saw themselves ; he gave them images of a new kind of elegance . " No , " she said , " I will not . tell you that . But Paul understands what those new people are doing , those people whom he has no wish to imitate . And he showed me how to look at pictures . I had not known that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at hills , horizons . " She gestured briefly . " I was a very ignorant girl . " Her manner confused me . It would do so to the end , confuse and charm me . What she said was direct and candid , always , and yet there was a reserve , a sense of things left unsaid . " Tom wants my portrait done , and I 'm determined that Paul Galantiereis the man to do it . When we are in London for the season . We have a house in London now , you know . In Chelsea . Would I be a good sort of subject for him , do you think ? " I smiled at her . " Not as you are now , not sitting in a field with a friend , and crusts of bread spread about us . But as he will have you pose , yes , a fine subject . " " But you , Lee Forrester . If you were a painter , you would paint me as I am now . " She had leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting her weight on an elbow . I could not , for that moment , imagine her anywhere else , nor looking any other way , and I envied Tom greatly . In the end , of course , Galantiere did " do " her , the portrait which hangs above the fireplace in the library , but which was once , when he exhibited it , the sensation of a season . Perhaps he did catch some truth about her . He was not all artifice and melodrama , as I may have suggested . And he was especially clever about women . Then too , of course , he knew her well  --  far more intimately than I ever would . In his painting , she offers you a challenge as she stands there in half light , half shadow , her face , though pale , lighted as it were from within . But on that day in the upland field , with no shadows save those thrown upon her from oak branches , on that day there was no challenge , but rather a repose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man whom she has just begun to trust . There were other days as well , of course , but they were all of a pattern , all like that late noontime in the field . Evenings had their pattern as well . That year , for some reason , we did not use the library after dinner , but rather went to the small drawing room which had been a favourite with Isabel , Tom 's mother , and held her piano . Tom would sit reading in his chair and I in mine , our lamps making pools of light . Sometimes Sylvia would real , but not often ; she was not a great reader . She mightp318leaf through a volume of prints , or leap up suddenly and go to Isabel 's piano . She loved Chopin , and played him with such feeling that I can still remember the sound of notes let loose in the room , moving towards the pools of light , towards windows beyond which drawn curtains and darknesshid the wildness of West Cork . Tom would rest his book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . The night bound us together  --  music , darkness , the sense of containment which the room held . I remember my own feelings as divided  --  my pleasure in our closeness together , and , distinct from that , my happiness for the two of them , and then , in its own complex abode , my sense of Sylvia , at once inviolable and sensual , lamplight full upon her throat and small , perfect bosom . Was there ever a time , then or later , when I was in love with her ? Perhaps , but we never spoke of it , not even later when we were to exchange the most intimate of confidences . Drawn curtains and the wildness of West Cork ! So smooth a formulation , and therefore so deceptive . All around , us a land and a people whom we did not know , save as servants , porters , coachmen , gillies , gamekeepers , gardeners . And these , a sardonic scholar might argue , were like those wild Indians of the American West whom the pioneers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those trained tribes , from photographs , a bowler hat with a feather in it , an ill-fitting frock coat , a manner  --  feigned or actual , who can say ?  --  of docility ; but the faces are savage , dark , the eyes hooded . So too , in my view , the servants and retainers of Ireland 's great landlord families . Not so very different , you will say , from circumstances in England or in France . And yet one feels the difference here , bogland and bare mountain enforce it . Once , Isabel and I stood upon a terrace , leaf-strewn , snow in the air , listening to rifle fire . Those fellows , those rebels , were , if you will , our trained Indians reverting to type  --  shopkeepers , stablehands , gardeners ' boys . English-speaking , almost to a man , their minds stuffed with the slogans of causes which had elsewhere grown stale , illwrittenpamphlets , a porridge of crude and fallacious history , legends of an ancient oppression . But they had , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mountainside . First and second cousins , most of them , of those Gaelic-speaking bog men who , significantly , had stood remote from those events , uncomprehending . Now , in this year of grace 1904 , there are few enough bookish people with whom one can talk of these or any other matters . The families of the small gentry , of course , would rather talk with Satan himself , or a Home Rule agitator , but these are in any event not bookish folk . Theyp319have their merits  --  honest enough , conscientious , sending off their sons to Trinity or the army or the bar ; but they live within their round of dusty pleasures , enraged , one may be certain , that Ardmor Castle , which should by rights be the glittering centre of their existence , as Lismore is elsewhere , or Trevane Castle in East Cork , is dark , empty , abandoned , save for the yearly visits of a poor relation and his mistress , a former lady 's maid . Tom , off there in Italy these ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club , like Beckford of Fonthill Abbey or Wilde of Reading Gaol . And , of course , they remember Sylvia , they remember that great ball which Tom and Sylvia gave to mark the fact of their wedding . That they will surely remember , as a token of the brilliance which could have been given to the town , to their lives . Curiously enough , I myself scarcely remember it . It had no mark of Sylvia upon it , nor of Tom either , but was bustling , noisy , crowded with people who did not suit each other well : the local people , and the other great families of Cork and Kerry and Waterford , and then the people whom Tom had brought over from London who had never been to Ireland in some cases , although most had spent a few weeks fishing in Connemara , and were disappointed by our less showy scenery . Sylvia liked it . I have one vivid recollection of her standing on the staircase , her hand upon the marble . A knot of people stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down towards them , eyes bright , lips slightly parted , an excited girl . I thought then that she was new herself into so large a life , child of mortgaged acres turned countess . I could make friends , no doubt , with the local rector , Charlie Cummings , despite his disapproval of my ways , but to what purpose ? He is , in his own timid way , a bit of a Liberal , keeping this well concealed , of course , for Liberals are universally regarded by our coreligionists as pawns of the Home Rulers . The pastor of Saint Jarlath 's , the Catholic church , is impossible , a shambling , hairy-nostrilled lout , and his curate a redcheekedenthusiast of hurling . Once , it is said , in the days before Catholic Emancipation , ironically , the priesthood attracted the sons of the old , decayed Catholic gentry , men of elegance , trained on the Continent , brimming with Fenelon and Bossuet . No longer . This leaves not the schoolmaster , a dough-faced little prig , but his predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savour , surprisingly well read , balanced in his judgements , and , most astonishing of all , one of the Fenian rebels of Clonhrony Wood . But why surprising , after all , for was not Bob Delaney himself a Fenian ? Delaney , who as much as anyone contrived , almost by acxcident , onr disaster ?  |p320We  exchange books occasionally , MacMahon and myself . He will walk stiffly , self-consciously , up the avenue , the books always carried with great care , for he addresses them with the superstitious awe of the selfeducated . Always , we meet here , in the library , with several , to me , most interesting exceptions . Prodigious is one of his greatest terms of praise . " Prodigious , " he will say , tapping with long finger my copy of Schliemann 's Mycenae , with its frontispiece of the Treasure of Atreus , close to the Lion 's Gate , as it is termed , and its grandiloquent dedication to " His Majesty Dom Pedro II , Emperor of Brazil , " with the " profound respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoverer and despoiler of Troy and latterly of Argos . " And with an introduction by Gladstone himself , " MacMahon will say . " Extraordinary . A man of diverse talents , the late Mr. Gladstone . " " Yes , " I will agree , extending towards him my box of Virginia cigarettes . " A great student of history , " MacMahon says , " and yet active in the world of practical events . " " All too active , perhaps , " I say , and by way of answer , be bends forward to accept my lighted match . Once , early one Saturday morning , I rode up to his small , pleasant house , and the two of us set off , afoot , into the hills . We spent the whole of that day walking and talking , pausing often , and once for an hour , for the lunch that he had packed , sandwiches made with thick slabs of bread , a cake . For that day and the next , and then only , MacMahon was able to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by accent , and , no doubt , much else besides from a past which we both remembered . " It is here , is it not , " I said to him , " along this road , that Ned Nolan tried to make his escape , ten years ago ? " He walked a bit before answering , then shook his head . " No , " he said , " not this road . " It was clear that he did not want the subject opened . But in my imagination , I placed Nolan on the road , ahead of us , a figure from the illustrated press , dark and menacing , long-striding , holding his murderous revolver . We were bound for the mountain village of Kildaragh , where MacMahonhad arranged that we should have beds in the tavern . Late that night , we found ourselves , the two of us , sitting side by side in the tavern 's crowded kitchen , close to the turf fire . Chairs of a sort had been provided for us , tokens of respect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sat perched on upturned porter barrels . There was a fiddle in thep321room . Now , for the first time , I heard the music which MacMahon had described to me , and it truly was , in its way , extraordinary . Like most Irishmen , however imperfect we may be , I knew a few Gaelic songs well enough to recognise : " The Coolin " and " The Blackbird " and a few others ; but I knew them in scrubbed versions , for drawing-room pianofortes . Here , in this foetid room , with its floor of close-packed earth , lit by turf glow , by a few scattered candles , drifts of tobacco smoke in the air , the music seemed , as it were , to arise from earth itself , from the mountains invisible beyond the two small windows , from the immense night . I stole a glance at MacMahon , who was keeping time to the music , his hand patting his knee . As much almost as myself , I thought , he is a stranger to these people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gaelic , his speech slower than theirs as he sought out the words . How must we seem to them , I thought , for although they seemed clumsy , awkward fellows , heavy and stolid , I knew this to be but a trick of culture , that within their own world they had their own alertness , their own ironies . Landlord , schoolmaster  --  visitors to be treated with courtesy . The music , as I say , seemed to arise from the earth itself . But I have heard such singing elsewhere  --  in the mountains of Macedonia , once in a Calabrian village . It did not hold for me the magic which drew MacMahontowards it . It was as though the music held a secret about himself , spoke with clarity feelings which he knew only as muddled , muddied . " It is all ending , you know , " he said abruptly the next morning , as we walked down towards his house  --  a damp morning , the thick grasses wet , and the heather clumps of damp , wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language itself . I helped to kill it , God forgive me . Myself and the other schoolmasters . " " History killed it , " I told him bluntly . " Railways and schoolmasters and newspapers and a long list of things . " At his house , he made me a cup of tea , and as we sat drinking it , we gradually reassumed the manner upon which we had settled , friendly and yet formal , a bit distant . Tall cases of books leaned over us , and through a clear , polished window , small-paned , I looked beyond fields towards the hills where we had spent the night . It was a bit later , as I was riding up the avenue  --  distant from me , just visible beyond a straggling plantation , the ruined Japanese garden  --  only then ( lid it occur to me how similar were our circumstances , MacMalion'sand mine . Ardmor Castle had outlived its time , so much was clear . Indeed , if one were to believe the editors and writers and the men whop322talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ardmor Castles had been sentenced by history . Buried , all of them , beneath a sea of mortgages , all but the largest ones , shattered by Parnell and the Land League , by agitators and terrorists . And now , most final sentence of all , the land bills which were making it tempting for us to sell out , pack up . But I have never been inclined to believe such people , with their theories produced upon demand , beside your eggcup every morning . I believe only what I can feel upon the fingertips , scent in the air , discover in the changing light . Even with the wings of the house shut off , it is too large for us , too large for Emily and myself and the few servants . I walk , some afternoons , after I have finished work , from room to room , the chairs and tables swathed in dusty muslin , dirt-streaked . In the empty ballroom , my heels clatter noisily , crack , crack on the wood like rifle shots.  |p323He  thought of himself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with broken wing . Once he left Manhattan entirely , and took work with an ex-Fenian named Tom Bonner , who had a brickyard up the Hudson River , beyond Peekskill . The work that Bonner found for him was neither demanding nor exacting , keeping him busy with tally sheets , checking up on loads of clay , straw , the wages of the workmen set down in a red-ruled ledger book . " I am fit for harder tasks than this , you know , " he told Bonner . " I am not a cripple . " " You are not fit because you lack the craft , " Bonner said . " Brickmakingis a craft ancient as Egypt . " Beyond the yard , beyond the kilns , crooked cobbled streets led to the village , fronting the river . A Catholic church of white-painted brick , raw and fresh , a churchyard with already a few gravestones iii it , men fromp324Derry , Cavan , Fermanagh . Workmen 's houses , built of the yard 's own brick , a small wooden porch tacked on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , would shout to the women who leaned upon the windowsills . The air , in spring , would be heavy with the smell of boiling cabbage , chops in a skillet . Nolan rented the back bedroom of a childless couple called Dennehy , and had his meals with them . There were two saloons . He favoured the Shamrock , which was closer to the river . In the Shamrock , Terry Brophy , a Cork City man , served beer in tall , handled schooners , shot glasses of bourbon , rye . Nolan drank little . He welcomed the company , listening to the voices , Ulster and Connaught accents flattened out by the tones of New York and Brooklyn . They had drifted here , most of them , from the city . Brooklyn was a second lost home for them , or for some a first ; some had been born in the States , and for these the Irish accent would be a faint whiff , picked up at home , in childhood . On Sundays , they would ride the cars down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , lining the long bar counter , their hands would be red with brick dust . They never forgot who he was , that was the one bad part of it . Or rather , who they thought he was , wanted him to be . In New York , he could lose himself for days or weeks , if he had the money for it , and then slip back to his haunts . For a time , he had sat on the platforms with other released Fenians , in crowded halls , floors stained with tobacco juice . Once , his name , with Rossa 's and Clandillon 's , had been on a painted banner stretched across the front of the hall , lit by gas flames . " Nolan of Clonbrony Wood . On battlefield and in prison cell . " Always , at the end , the crowd , large or small , would sing " God Save Ireland , " and the hat would be passed around , " for the cause , " or " for the lads still in England 's grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platforms , put his signature to pieces of paper , or to the poor likeness of himself that was hawked at the door for a nickel . Pictures of Rossa went for a quarter , and for fifty cents you could buy a large cardboard with the likenesses , framed in ovals , of the Manchester Martyrs  --  Allen , Larkin , and O'Brien . " High upon the gallows tree ... " But at Van Brunt 's Point , in spring weather , he could leave the Shamrock , and walk down the path which led from it to the river . It was a broad river , broad as the Shannon , with mountains in the distance on the far shore . In evening cool , ships moved north towards Albany or south towards the docks of Manhattan . Breezes , sweet-smelling or odoursome , would come off the water towards him . The river and the distant hills , his sense of mountains and ranges of mountains beyond those , forests and prairies , could fill him with a quiet happiness . But his years in the cellp325never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls pressing in upon him , the blackness , the sounds at night which were best left undeciphered . In the quarries , in winter , swinging mallet or pick , in silence , the light falling bleak and cold upon all of them , faces which now he remembered only from prison , the past wiped blank . But at night , lying upon straw and wool , he would fight off the past , remembering the clear pasturelandsof Munster , and before that , the farmlands of Tennessee and Virginia . Once , walking along the towpath which led to the brickyard 's dock , he heard steps behind him , and turned to meet Bonner . Together , they walked to the dock 's edge , where an empty barge lay moored , faintly moving in response to the strong current . Bonner picked up a triangular fragment of brick , and scaled it into the darkening water . " Ancient Egypt , " Nolan said , and Bonner took the point . " And other things , " he said . " You have a good pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could use a good straw boss . I 've bought up river frontage across there , at Stony Point . Set out another yard . New York City is mad for bricks ; there is no end to the building of that city . And the Irish have the word put in for them , at City Hall . " " You are on the road to fortune , Tom , " Nolan said . " More power to your arm . " " But it would be a six-day-a-week job , " Bonner said , " and late nights , a few of them in the season . " Nolan nodded , his absent gaze upon the spot of river where the scaled bit of brick had sunk . " You know what I am saying , " Bonner said . " You can not hold down a decent job here or anywhere else , so long as you stand ready for any errand the organization sends you off on . Philadelphia , Chicago . You know what I am saying , Ned . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's discretion . He had been a wild boy himself , years before , with a past like Nolan 's own , the emigrant ship and then the Yankee army and then the Rising . No longer . " Mind you , " Bonner said , treading on the heel of Nolan 's thought , " I am a member myself of the organization , dues paid up and a bit over from time to time . And not too many questions as to where the funds go or how they are spent . But this is a different day and age . You wo n't free Ireland by sending over the occasional lad to put a bullet in a grabber . Nor by travelling off to Chicago to put paid to an informer . " " Is that what I do ? " Nolan asked . " I have no wish to know what you do , " Bonner said . " I am not your judge . "  |p326He  was at Van Brunt 's Point , working for Bonner , the better part of six months , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days  --  not to work , but drawn by the river , by its promise of freedom . For a year and a bit , he lived in two unfurnished rooms near the New York docks , a five minutes ' walk from the flat in which his father and himself had lived , before the war . Walking those streets , which he could not quite remember , moments of that earlier time would recur to him : His father 's florid , confident face , roseate above flowered waistcoat . Or his father coming home late from meetings no different from those which Nolan himself now attended . No difference at all  --  perhaps the banners and the bunting were passed on from one decade to the next  --  emerald green , harps , tinsel swords . It was in that year that he had the girl from Cork who worked as a skivvy in Murray Hill . Thursday was her afternoon off , and they did not care how late she stayed out , if she was back at work by six . " It would be different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They are most particular . They have a position in the household , like . But they do n't care about slaveys , the Sturdevants do n't . " " Is that your great wish , " Nolan said , " to become a parlourmaid ? " " They have a clean , lovely life , " she said , " waxing and dusting . " But she was always cleanliness itself when she came to him , her body scrubbed so hard that the smell of yellow soap became part of his erotic expectations . Later in the year , she was elevated to parlourmaid , and then they would have the afternoon and evening until eight . She would walk from bedroom to small sitting room , wearing only a tight-waisted petticoatof white muslin , her bare breasts free , the brown nipples brownencircled . Once , after they had made love , she saw him watching her from the bed . " Do you think me shameless ? " she asked . " T is not that at all . " " I am filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take pleasure from the shame . Can you understand that ? " " You must have long and interesting conversations with your confessor , " Nolan said , and she did not reply . Her name was Margaret . Margaret Quill . On the day before Christmas Eve , she came to tell him that a young American boy named Edward Reilly , a grocer 's helper , had asked her to marry him . " What did you tell him ? " Nolan asked . The windows of all the grocery shops and butcher shops were decked with red paper and green paper , and front hooks above the butchers ' windows hung plump geese and turkeys . The corner confectioner hadp327outdone himself , with flakes to represent snow clinging to the roofs of a small village , houses and farms and neat-spired white Protestant church . Before the model village , sweets and chocolates filled red boxes . There was a pond of glass , and small figures skating upon it . " I told him that I would be honoured to be his wife , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She had removed her hat and heavy coat , snow-wet , and they sat side by side on the bed , their faces turned towards one another . " It could be your good fortune instead , " she said . " No , " he said , and reaching his two hands behind her inclined neck , began to unfasten her black gown . " They say that you were a class of a general with the Fenians , " she said , " and then you shot a landlord and were put away in prison . " " Something like that , " he said . Carefully , he undid the fastenings , which ran the length of her back , and then , picking up each hand , undid the fastenings at the wrist . Then he slipped the gown from her , and after it , the white embroidered camisole . She sat quietly . " Two rooms the size of these , " she said , " and the use of a kitchen . They could be made to look lovely . All clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he freed her breasts , she said , " Next week he will take me to have tea with his mother , a widow who lives on the West Side . " Her nipple , when his fingers touched it , was already erect . He put an arm around her shoulder and drew her down onto the bed . He may have caught a glimpse of her a few years later , at the great memorial service for John O'Mahony , in Irving Hall . But he could not he certain . Young women who looked a bit like her were scattered throughout the cavernous hall . He was standing behind the platform , in the wings , with a dozen others waiting to be led out as warriors in the movement which O'Mahony had founded , twenty years before . But he was almost certain , her lips parted and her eyes bright . She was wearing a coat with a bit of fur at the collar , with a small round hat to match . There was a pleasant-looking , ginger-headed young fellow beside her . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a few blocks away , in wretched rooms , dark and airless . They sat together by a dusty window , looking down a long street to the river , which was blocked from their view by a warehouse . A chill day , and no fire . Nolan had brought a bottle ; it stood on the table between them . O'Mahony 's coat was buttoned to the collar , and he had a rug wrapped about his legs . The face was still handsome , fine-honed , and the down-curving moustache , although grey-flecked , was still Clark.  | " It could be an Irish day , " he said , " a winter 's afternoon . " He had been with O'Brien and Stephens at Ballingeary , in ' fortyeight . Thirty years ago . But he remembered Irish afternoons . Above a table at the far side of the room hung the print which everyone knew , O'Mahony in his uniform as a colonel in the Federal army , hawk-nosed and militant . O'Mahony saw that Nolan was looking towards it . " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary . It was not a grand military career , in command of depots and garrisons . We were waiting out the war , then ours would begin . Ach , what need to tell you , Ned . You were with us . " Carefully , Nolan measured more whiskey into the two glasses . " In Tennessee , " he said , " under this commander or that one . But it was you I served . " O'Mahony lifted , in deprecation , a long , white hand . " We had begun even then quarrelling among ourselves while you were still off there in Tennessee . ' Sixty-five was to be the year . But on everything else we quarrelled . We are still quarrelling . They are . I am out of it . " He added water , a quick splash , to his glass . " I spoke at your father 's graveside , Ned . You know that . My remarks were widely printed , in the Irish papers of this country . Boston . Here . Chicago . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most generous . " " He gave his life to Ireland , I said . What does that sort of language mean ? I no longer know . " " You have given your own life , Colonel , " Nolan said . It was true enough , he thought , sitting beside the shrunken man in the chair , lap-robed and shivering . A strong-farmer 's son from the old Catholic gentry , the chiefs of the Comeraghs ; he had thrown it away to ride into Ballingeary with revolver and rifle . A scholar , in New York in the first confident years he had translated Keating 's old history out of the Gaelic ; learned men had praised it . It was his scholarship which had found for them their famous name , from the warrior brothers in the ancient sagas : the Fenian Brotherhood . Now he had this , these rooms , a bottle brought as a gift . He was banished from the Council , like Stephens . But power had been stripped from him so long ago that he had been forgiven . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hand made a wide gesture . " I have disposed of my library , " he said . " Clutter . Dead words , crumbling paper . I keep a few books in the bedroom , and read them over and over . O'Donovan 's great translation of the Annals . Rabelais . Swift . Torn Jones . I would like to give you a copy of my translation , but they have all been given away , long sn1CC.  | " I have your translation , " Nolan said . " It is a noble work . " " Noble , " O'Mahony said , with an underlining of irony . " Workmanlike , rather . You do not have the Gaelic yourself ? It is dying out . A people without a language . You had a hard few years of it there , in that English prison ? " " Hard enough , " Nolan said . For a time they sat in silence . Nolan measured out more whiskey . He was not certain why he had made the visit , but the old man seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commanding General , " O'Mahony said at last . " That was the title we gave me . I was the Commanding General , and Stephens was Chief Organiser of the Irish Republic ! " Suddenly he began to laugh , but it turned into a dry , wheezing cough . " First I was shoved aside , and then the fellows who threw me over were thrown over in their turn . Informers , braggards , drunkards , cuckolds  --  my God , what a crew they had there in Fenian House , as they called it . We let you down ; the whole pack of us let down the young lads on the hillside . " He sighed . " A long time ago . " " What matters is the organization , " Nolan said , " the organization and the oath . You gave those to us , yourself and Stephens . That is always remembered of you ; it always will be . " " I hate cities , " O'Mahony said , " and I have spent the half of my life in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , the mean shop fronts , and the cobbles glistening in the rain . You are yourself deep in the counsels of the organization , I have heard . " " Not deep , " Nolan said . " I do their bidding from time to time . " " You bear no great resemblance to your father . He was fair , and you are dark . We were gentlemen , or at least tried to be  --  Thomas Nolan , John Mitchel , Meagher of the Sword , Richard O'Gorman . But the fellows who are in it now  --  who the hell are they , can you answer me that ? Devoy seems all right , I grant you Devoy . " " With respect , " Nolan said , " it is not gentlemen who are required for revolutions . " For the first time that afternoon , O'Mahony smiled with what seemed genuine pleasure . " That may well be the case . Wolfe Tone was much of your opinion . There is a nice story told of O'Conor of Belnagare , back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the O'Conor Dons . But between Cromwell and the Penal Laws , he had been crushed down , little better than a peasant . One day he and his son were ploughing together , and the son spoke to him with insolence . Have a care , sir , ' said O'Conor , ' for you are but a ploughboy 's son , but I am the son of a gentleman . ' " f le nodded . " You may well he right . " Spattering rain fell upon the window.  | " I held things together as best I could , " he said , " but that was n't good enough . First Roberts split us in two , with his Senate ' wing and that mad raid into Canada . Then Stephens and McCafferty at each other 's throats , revolvers drawn . My God , boy , when a man 's moment in history is over , he should vanish . In a puff of smoke . Or drop down the trapdoor in the stage . " O'Mahony here in New York , shoved aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Nolan took his orders , not in O'Mahony'smeaning of the word . Rossa , a shop assistant from Skibbereen ; McCafferty , a bully who had learned his trade in the war , with Confederateirregulars . Beyond the dusty window , Nolan could see an empty street shrouded by thin rain . The shops had turned on their lamps against an early darkness  --  a coal merchant , a greengrocer , an ironmonger . At the far corner , a saloon , its lamps globed in green and red , welcoming beyond rain , the chill of early winter . " But I have yet a part to play , Captain Nolan , " O'Mahony said . " Once I am dead , they can put me to work . I will return to Ireland then , Captain , and no mistake about it . Thousands marching along behind the coffin , ebony-draped . A quarrel , perhaps , for possession of the corpse , Fenians and Parliament men battering each other , with Her Majesty 's constabulary to the keep the ring . And who at the graveside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pigott , perhaps , or one of the Sul-livans ? " Embarrassed , Nolan glanced away , and found himself looking again at the print of the uniformed colonel , poised and confident , a bit too theatrical . " Oh , yes , " O'Mahony said . " I know ; no man knows this better than myself . I helped to bundle up the gin-soaked bones of Terence Bellew MacManus , and ship them off to Dublin . All the way from San Francisco . He was a useless sort of fellow in life , poor Terence ; amiable but useless . But in death , by God , he put his shoulder to ' the wheel . " Nolan suddenly laughed , and turned away from the bright-coloured print , gaudy gilt insignia upon a tunic of midnight blue . " It is best to look at things slant , Ned , " O'Mahony said , " rather than head-on . It gives you a purchase upon life . " The lap robe had slipped to the floor . Ned knelt and tucked it about O'Mahony 's knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the print , were half closed , and the still-handsome head was sinking . " I will call in on you again if I may , " Nolan said . " By all means , Captain . By all means . Your father 's son is always welcome . A splendid man , your father . Thomas Justin Nolan . I Ic neverp331found himself in this country . He was very proud of you , you know . I met him once during the war , at the Astor Bar . He had in his pocket a letter you had sent him , from Tennessee I think it was , or Virginia . He read a bit of it to me . " When Nolan was at the door , he turned around to speak , but O'Mabonywas half asleep . In the street , he walked a block or two to a coal merchant 's , and arranged to have a few bags sent up to the colonel . Then he walked westwards , in the distance the rain-clouded river . O'Mahony 's funeral went off as though he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil : the service in Webster Hall , and the faithful gathered at the dock with black crepe armbands . In the hold of a steamship , coffin enclosed in sturdy planking , the first Head Centre of the Fenian Brotherhood returned at last to Ireland . Fenians and moderatenationalists vied for the honour of walking behind the coffin up Sackville Street to Glasnevin . It was raining that day in Dublin as well , the mean Irish drizzle of grey rain , but most walked with hats in hand , as token of respect . Newspapers were sent back to New York , with prints showing the crowd massed by the graveside in Glasnevin . Richard Pigott , standing beside the grave , read an oration sent from America by O'Donovan Rossa . " All differences set aside , " Rossa said , through Pigott 's lips , " we mourn today the death of the Chief , the Founder , gallant soldier , true Irishman . " " All differences set aside , " Charlie Duignan said to Nolan . " That 's a good one . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mick Coogan , the headquarters man . In the rear , by the door which led to the alley , at a small table , a beer before Nolan and a glass of whiskey before Duignan , his fingers curled around it . " I will hear nothing said against John O'Mahony , " Nolan said . He was facing the swinging double doors . " Not from me , " Duignan said . His family had come over from l imerick when he was three , and his speech was New York . Thoid he said for third , and erl for oil . Nolan was not fond of the accent , nor of Duignan . " We 've been destroyed by differences , " Duignan said , " from the time of the Senate wing and the first big split . By God , if these fellows now wo n't see the sense of that , they must be made to see it . " " Something like that , " Nolan said . " Rossa has always been someone to march in his own parade , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises of Jeremiah ) ' Donovan Rossa . " The swinging doors parted , but it was not Coogan . Two Yanks , onep332of them in coat and trousers of broad plaid , parted hair glistening with oil . " He was not marching in his own parade in Dartmoor Prison , " Nolan said . " In Dartmoor Prison he was a man in a cell , tormented . For all those years they were at him , but he would not be broken . " Duignan said nothing , and in the silence Nolan returned to Portland Prison . In blackness he lay on his pallet , that blackness unimaginable to others , the blackness not of night merely , but of a hostile , hating confinement , the sun closed off by stone and iron . Nolan remembered one night , early on , when he began suddenly to scream , the notes rising , a girlish , soprano scream . Up and down , to left of him and right , tin cups and slop buckets commenced to clatter , whether in sympathy or annoyance he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed , but when he heard others , he would mouth , silently . " He 's straight , " Duignan said , " Rossa is straight . But he 's fucking crazy , and he ca n't leave this stuff alone . " His forefinger tapped the rim of his glass . Coogan pushed through the door , and stood within the smoky room , his head turning from this side to that , until he saw them . He was a Leitrim man , powerfully built , short , with heavy , squat shoulders , massive head set upon short , thick neck . An abstainer , he took a glass of ginger beer at Duignan 's insistence . " The expenses you will have are in an envelope I will pass along to you . The railroad and lodgings out there and meals and the rest of it . It will see you through and a bit left over . There are so many Irishmen in Chicago that you can lose yourself amongst them . But stay clear of the organization . You are a couple of Paddies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that the organization has the goods on this fellow , " Duignan said . " No doubt about it . " " No , " Coogan said , " no doubt . " Then , after a pause , he said , " Eh , Ned ? " " Not in my mind , " Nolan said . " Perhaps there is in your own , " Coogan said to Duignan . " If there is , you should back off . I will send off no man on such a task if he has his doubts . " " No , no , " Duignan said quickly . They were days travelling on the cars between New York and Chicago . Duignan was excited at first , calling Nolan 's attention to every town , low range of distant hills , water tower . But the monotony of the journey reached him at last , and he subsided . He wandered up and claw  --  the aisles , having conversations with strangers , and , once or twice , taking part iii ap333game of cards . But Nolan cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brittle ice upon which sunlight fell pale and watery , houses and barns of timber , red-painted , bright against snow . Farm children , muffled and gloved against the cold , waved to them . The distances between towns was immense . Dr. Sheehan lived in a suburb of the city , the frame houses sturdy and substantial , many of them with turrets and widow 's walks , but the streets were unpaved and muddy . There were no gas lights . Nolan and Duignan waited in a byroad beyond Sheehan 's house , in their hired car , the horse tired and placid . About ten that night , Sheehan 's buggy came clown the road , and he climbed out and threw the horse 's reins over the hitching post . As he reached inside for his surgical bag , Nolan began walking towards him , with Duignan following . " Dr. Sheehan , " Nolan said . " Yes , " Sheehan said , startled . " Yes ? Who is that ? " Nolan saw him in faint moonlight . The tintype had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles and a dark , close-cropped heard . The bag looked heavy . Sheehan shifted it from his right hand to his left . " You know who we are , right enough , " Nolan said . " You have been expecting us . " Sheehan craned forward . " Do I know you , lads ? I can not see you clearly . " " Kevin Timothy Sheehan , " Nolan began , and Sheehan gave a long sigh , interrupting him . " Yes , " he said , " I know who you are . " " Sentence has been pronounced against you , " Nolan said . " You are entitled to hear it . " " I am entitled to more than that , " Sheehan said . " No , " Nolan said . " You were twice summoned to New York to answer the evidence . I wonder you did not do a flit . " " Once , " Sheehan said . " I was called once by the Council , not twice . I could not leave my practice . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house were lit , and Nolan could see a figure , Sheehan 's wife or else the maidservant moving behind the drawn shade . " It is all over , Doctor , " Nolan said . " Talking is of no use . " " Give him his time , Ned , for God 's sake , " Duignan said . " An Act of Contrition and a minute to compose himself . " " Ile has a fair amount to he contrite about , " Nolan said , " and time is short . "  | " Ned , " Sheehan said . " I have you now . Ned Nolan . I saw you once in Hibernian Hall . " " And wrote me up in a special despatch to Mr. Anderson in Dublin Castle ? " Nolan said . " Or did you save me for one of your trips across into Canada , one of your talks with Mr. Fleming ? " " Dear Jesus , " Sheehan said . For a moment , no one spoke . " I have my rosary , " Sheehan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rosary . To Our Lady . " He reached his hand into the pocket of his overcoat , and as he was drawing it out , Nolan raised his arm and shot him . He was hurled backward , and as he began to fall , Nolan shot him twice more , full in the chest . With a wary eye upon the house , Nolan knelt beside him , and Duignan joined them , not kneeling , but with his hands pressed down upon his bent knees . He stared at the smashed chest , the open , staring eyes , beard-framed gaping mouth , and then , turning his head swiftly to the side , vomited . Carefully , Nolan drew the hand out of Sheehan 's pocket . The fingers were still curled loosely about the revolver , and he drew out hand and revolver together . When Duignan , coughing , had placed a handkerchief across his mouth , Nolan said , " There is your rosary . " " Oh God , " Duignan said . " Oh God , oh God . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Duignan got himself drunk . Nolan sat beside him , first in one bar and then in another , taking one careful drink to Duignan 's four or five , and monitoring what he said . In the early hours of the morning , he saw him back to their lodging house and put him to bed . Two days later , they went back to New York . By the time they reached the terminal , Duignan was almost himself again , and beginning to swagger a bit , to hint at secret errands . Nolan sought out Coogan , and said , " Never again give me that sort of task . I have no stomach for it . " " But you did it , Ned , " Coogan said . " A neat , clean job , and it had to be done . " " Not by me , " Nolan said . " Not again . " It was not until the eighties that he broke that oath , but the killing of Dr. Sheehan was enough to set the seal upon his reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Ned Nolan spread in Fenian circles , that he was one of the hard men , one of the irreconcilables . " He carries a gun with him , " they would say , " and he has used it more than once . " " Small blame , " they would say , " after the things that were done to him in that prison . " In those days , the organization was a spectralp335being , moving behind the facades of mass meetings , parades , patriotic holidays on the shores of New Jersey and Long Island , more bunting , and immense portraits of Washington and Robert Emmet in twin ovals . It called itself now the Clan na Gael , and judges and congressmen were among its members , Tammany sachems , lawyers , assemblymen . But somewhere within the Clan was the unnamed Supreme Council . Devoy controlled it , perhaps , or O'Donovan Rossa . Or perhaps they took their orders from Dublin , or Belfast . It fed itself upon mystery , upon the legends of the ' sixty-seven rising , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nolan was part of that . At Clan na Gael picnics on sandy beaches , children shouting , speeches and then a game of ball , New York policemen and firemen with Irish names would nudge each other and nod towards him . But he went to such affairs because Devoy thought they were good for morale . Black-jacketed , a crow among fleshy , perspiring men in candy-striped shirts . His cousin Hugh MacMahon wrote regularly to him , and there would be once or twice a year a letter from Bob Delaney . They would have written more often , but Nolan did not always reply . When he did , his language was stiff , constrained , unlike MacMahon 's genial , calculated rambling , and Delaney 's crisp enthusiasms , sardonic accounts of his own successes , local follies . But he saved all the letters , and would once in a while reread them . The few weeks which he had spent with them in Kilpeder expanded into one of his centres of imaginative being . He recalledMacMahon 's parlour , Mary at the pianoforte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's yelping laugh as he unscrewed a flask . The distant Munster town he remembered in such odd , random moments , domestic and at ease . The crash of rifle fire , Clonbrony Wood , shattered the memory . Beyond the town , beyond Clonbrony , beyond the hillside cabin from which he had sent out the raiders , lay the hills which he had never visited , brown or green or purple in the constantly changing light . In imagination he walked them , along thin , forbidding paths , beside pure , icy rivulets , gorse , rocks scrubbed black and shiny as anthracite by rain and iiiist . Turning , in imagination , Kilpeder would lie spread before him , spired , populous , unreachable.  |p336In  memory , I can hear a Dublin hawker of ballads , his voice nasal and whining , as he offers to passersby his latest composition . He sings , " For the uncrowned king of Ireland lies in Kilmainharri Gaol . " I can remember nothing about the man himself , nor the time of day , nor what others heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only the voice itself , and it does not carry more to me than that one line . But it fixes for me a time in all of our lives . It was in October of 1881 that Parnell and the other leaders were arrested and imprisoned in Kilmainham , and they were there until the following May , after the " treaty , " as it was called , had been signed . And in the Christmas week of that year , I went up to Dublin to pay a visit upon Bob Delaney , who was in Dublin upon Land League business or his own or Tully 's business , off and on for the most of that winter . Once during that week , Bob 's affairs took him into hilniainhani itself , to consult with Parnell and Egan , and I went out with loin in thetram , a lovely brief journey , with the Phoenix Park just beyond . He would be several hours at least , and so I walked through the wintry park , its trees bare-branched , lining the long stately avenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled down in the public house across from the prison entrance . It is a fierce , forbidding building , its stones immense and sullen . There were no ballad hawkers outside Kilmainham , you may be certain , but the song is nevertheless entwined for me with my view of the prison itself , as I sat looking out towards it , nursing my pint of porter . A cold day , a damp , Dublin cold which the turf fire fought in vain , and I sat huddled within my overcoat . " By God , " Bob said when he joined me , " they have a grand life of it in there , Parnell and the others . A sitting room as big as this tavern , and Parnell 's bedroom , it could not be called a cell , leading off from it . They are being confined in great state . " He signalled the barman , holding his two hands to signify that he needed a tall one . He was in great good spirits . And there , in those words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parnell was in prison right enough , and his chief lieutenants with him , but there was no way in which the British could keep him there forever . The ballad , with its air of weepy lamentation , was an expected ritual , a dutiful grieving that yet another Irish leader had been flung into a dungeon . But this was no four-for-a-tanner leader , this was Charles Stewart Parnell , whom we had indeed come to regard , in a few short years , as our uncrowned king , negotiating , from within a gaol , with Gladstone himself , the parleyings of equals . It is painful now to look back on those years.  |p337After  the long , bleak decade which stretched outwards from our wretched rising , everything suddenly tumbled upwards from wherever it is that history keeps her energies concealed . Young Patrick Prentiss , perhaps , could find a pattern in it , but I find none . The fearful , black harvest of ' seventy-nine , when it seemed that another famine was upon us , Parnell 's seizure of political control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening at once , and all the parts of it feeding one another . Suddenly , or at least so it now seems , suddenly we were moved from lethargy , from a kind of casual and painless despair , into excitements , hopes , torchlit processions , cheering crowds . Later , in those final years of his , when Bob had ample time to talk and reflect , we would turn , the two of us , to the question of why , of how it had happened , and of how , because of it , the country was changed , forever it would seem . But Bob had no better answers than I had myself , although Bob was drawn close to the centre of events , and I was myself but one of the hurlers om the ditch . " The uncrowned king , " he said to me , in one of the late years . " A mysterious phrase . " " A good phrase for the hustings , " I said , " for ballads , newspapers . " I was affecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not share . For those of us who stood at the foot of platforms looking upwards , at meetings held in the long , light evenings , but with torches and pitch barrels flaring , looking upwards at the rows of county councillors crammed into ill-fitting suits , local dignitaries , Land League agents , the occasional bland , smiling priest  --  for us he was an uncrowned king or something of that sort , well-tailored clothes ruined by the careless manner in which he wore them , a knit shooting waistcoat , rough and well-used beneath dark , rich broadcloth . He was a handsome man , as even his enemies allowed , but his vanity did not run to physical appearances , and he never seemed conscious of his even features : the black , deep-set eyes ; high , arched nose ; the silky , auburn beard . We always remembered his voice . Not that what he said was memorable ; far from it . He had a gift for ordering an argument , and one for spare , unornamented energy of language . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the famous speech at Ennis , which in effect declared war upon the government . Bob was in Ennis that day , not yet a sitter upon platforms , but standing close to that one , and he came home to tell me that Parnell spoke out his words flatly and without gestures , his hands at his side curled tight , as though oratory was a trial for him . No , what we remembered of his voice was its manner and its accent , which was for us the accent of  |p338landlords  , fox hunters , indolent indifferent men on horseback , their voices carrying the unmistakable authority of overlordship . " And he looked like a king in command , " I said to Bob , light mockery , self-protecting , quoting a line from one of the ballads . " So he did , " Bob said in that late year , " so he did . " We were sitting in his solicitor 's office , which fronted on the market square  --  a large , square room which had once been in constant bustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gannon , and Jamesey shouting out a mock-insolent rejoinder , a pair of clients in the room perhaps , strong-farmers , fleshy and red-faced , and the wide mahogany desk strewn with papers , joined by some mysterious order known only to Jamesey , but the room dusty now , the desk bare save for brass inkstand and whiskey decanter , and the window dirt-streaked . " So he did , " Bob said . " Like a king in command . Do you know what they are all saying now , O'Brien and that little cur I Italy and the rest of them ? Each of them in turn comes forward to say that Parnell was simply Parnell ' to him , but Mr. Parnell ' to the others . God , the gobshite snob/bery of the Irish . To desert a man , and then stand firm upon a point of social precedence . " " And which was it for you ? " I said . " Parnell ' or Mr. Parnell ' ? " Bob smiled , and measured whiskey into our glasses , lovely Waterford tumblers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , none of us . Healy was close to him , by way of party business , but he never mingled with us after hours , so to speak . Old stagers with a bit of gentility clinging to them , they saw a bit of him : O'Gorman Mahon and a few of those . He was as much a mystery to us as he was to the rest of the country . He made use of that mystery . He would stroll into the House late at night , well after the dinner hour , and take his seat , with his tall hat pulled down over his eyes . They hated him , the Liberals as well as the Tories , make no mistake about that . They could laugh at the rest of us , call us counterboysand bog-trotters , but they could not laugh at him . " And though I had talked with him once , had shaken his hand ; though I had been to a dozen of his meetings ; though , at the end , at considerable personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty or forty others , in a windswept town square , with a mob hurling taunts at us , at him , he was for me in life what he is now in  - -  - emory  --  an outline , a shape , into which we had poured our hopes . A dreary decade , I have called the seventies , and so they were from the point of view of fellows like myself and Bob , who were what the cant phrase of the time called " advanced nationalists , " by which was meant I ' cnians who had been so tempered by experience that they were unlikely to shoot at you from behind a ditch . But for others , by which is meant t he great majority of ordinary people , rich and poor , it was a golden season of fine harvests . It is as though the Rising , like the famine earlier by two decades , was a wound healed over , a whitened patch of flesh without pain or feeling . Below us , in towns like Skibbereen and Schull , the famine graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame and scandal to survivors that we had ever , and well within memory , sunk so low . In Cork , at least  --  I can not speak for other counties  --  the famine had cut a clean swath , and the poorest of the poor were gone , the fellows of one or two acres , or no acres at all , but perched for a season on some scrawny hillside that could furnish forth a lazy bed of potatoes , gone to the famine graves or the workhouses or the emigrant ships . There were few now who did not have their twenty acres at least , and the number of substantial farmers had grown mightily . All that was to change , all that warm late summer of contentment . And the change began with the three wretched harvests which ended the seventies . The summer of ' seventy-seven was wet and cold , the skies lowp340and close , and there seemed a constant drizzle of rain . There was a break in the bad weather , just long enough to let the farmers save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they held for cattle and there was the best yield of butter that had been seen for years . But the following year was worse : there was no respite for the hay , all prices fell together , and most frightening of all , the blight returned to the potato , and the heavy rains and floods helped to spread it . It was like early winter , that summer of ' seventy-eight , the heavy air sweet with the smell of burning turf . When you walked into one of Kilpeder 's public houses , you would see there farmers standing together , talking little . The weather that summer cut short my Sunday rambles , but once , with a few hours of rare , bright sunlight , I set out towards the hills , and as I neared the Killeter crossroads , I came upon a long , wide field of potatoes which the blight had touched . I was separated from it by a high fence of stone , a dry wall . There was no one in sight , although smoke rose from the farmhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the doors and window frames painted a bright , fresh blue . In a far pasture , a herd rested beneath wide-spreading oak branches . Beyond that , far to my left , a stream tumbled down a rain-choked hill , with no sound coming to me from that distance . A scene for Constable , you will say , or Stubbs ; but the white substance , splashed across the potato plants , at random , sent a shiver through me . It was like the emblem of an ancient terror . It was then , in that second of the bad harvests , that the farmers began asking the landlords for abatements of the rents , and with such success as may be predicted ; and to make matters the worse for them , there was a great tightening of credit at the banks . And a tightening of credit as well with regard to those less formal transactions which farmers had been in the habit of using . But the firm of Tully and Son was an exception to this , with the old man standing ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an account , whether a large one ora small , and to make the prudent loan . It was no longer a matter of a handshake in the back room , or of an X scrawled upon a sheet of paper , but all was done in a proper and legal manner , and in Bob 's office , with legal documents crammed with Latin obscurities and the signatures of witnesses , and seals of red wax . Once , when Mary and I had gone for tea to the Delaneys , Bob left the two women to talk together of this thing and that , and drew me into the room which held his books . The tall window looked out across the road to Tully 's house , a proud , bullying building of three storeys , which you would be more likely to sec in Cork City or Limerick , set solidly upon its own grounds . From a leather box on the table , he drew out two cigars ,  |p341and  the two of us stood together by the window , the air fragrant with good tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more solid than many a small landlord in this barony . There is a thought for you . " But it was a thought which had often occurred to me , and I could think of nothing by way of a reply . " Lands , leases , notes , tenancies . When he reads , his lips move silently , and his eyes squeeze almost shut . And yet he is by now more banker than shopkeeper . By God , Hughie , is he not a wonderful being ? " " He has wonderful assistance , " I said , from truthfulness rather than courtesy . " Even there , Hughie , even there . He has the gift of foresight , as all great commanders have , Caesar and Bonaparte and Sheridan . A small farmer 's son comes to him as a shop assistant , and he sees in him the makings of a solicitor . " He turned away from the window and looked towards me , the cigar clamped between his teeth in a manner that Vincentwould have carried off with an air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looks at a Fenian back from six months of hard labour , and sees a son-in-law . He has the gift of divination , of prophecy . " He made me uneasy , as though , against his own nature , he had moved into a vein of coarse and unappealing cynicism . " I am in his debt , Hughie . What do I not owe to him  --  this house , i  --  y solicitor 's articles , my law books , the chance to move out from behind a counter . Not , mind you , that I am not now well able to pay my own way . My practice extends each year . I would have a comfortable income if I did not do another stroke of work for Tully and Son . But there is a heavy debt there all the same . He has no need to remind me of it . " " But he does find ways to remind you ? " I asked . " No , no , " he said at once . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a generous man , when he has a liking for you . But it is an oppressive feeling , for all that . Ach , what am I saying , can you tell Inc that ? " But I could not . I had my own private feelings about the Tullys , as I have earlier set forth , although I exempted Agnes and Vincent , who seemed not to be Tullys at all . And this seemed a conversation in poor taste , with Agnes sitting distant from us by but the thickness of a wall . But between Bob and myself there had rarely been secrets and reticences , perhaps now I should have pressed him as to the causes of his unease . Instead of which , we smoked down our cigars in a companionable nearsilence . " He is a godsend , certainly , " I said at last , " at the present moment.  |p342If  the talk in town is to be believed at all , there are twenty farmers at least who owe it to Dennis Tully that they have this day roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in extending credit to the small fellows as well . " Bob shot me a look that was almost one of anger . " As I have said , " he said dryly , " he is a generous man . " " All right , then , " I said . " He has his own reasons for what he does . A grand house like the one across the way is not conjured out of the empty air . The fellows who have borrowed from him will have a heavy sack of debt . But he will give them time , and the landlords would not , and the banks would not . If there is a Tully flourishing in Kilpeder , it is because he is needed . " " I know that , Hughie , " he said . " I know that . But is not this barony in a sorry state if two bad harvests can wedge the people between the landlords on the one hand and the gombeen men on the other . " It was an ugly term , and rarely had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets and public houses of Kilpeder was casual and universal . It was a term from the Tully past , from the huckster 's shop in the lane , a clod of muck flung against the tall house of bow windows and rose-red brick . " Two bad harvests , " I remember him saying , and that would place his words in 1878 , with terrible ' seventy-nine yet to come . In the first two years of the bad harvests , at least the prices held for store cattle and for butter . But in the year that followed , the harvest was wrecked again , first the hay and then the grains , and a winter followed that was the worst in memory , with the cattle suffering and many sheep dying . If the farmers , and the labourers who depended upon them , had been grim in the years before , they were now petrified with alarm , and small blame to them . The summers of those years were but a milder form of winter , the days even of July and August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skies low and masked by dirty grey cloud . In the summer of ' seventy-eight , the potato blight appeared again . Although it was but local and transient , it was like a messenger from the unspeakable past . Once , of a wet chilly August Sunday , I walked out for a few miles along the north road . The rain would come in spattering gusts , and I would take the shelter of a hedge . Then it would clear again , for a half hour or so , and the clouds in the western sky would shift , but there was no clear , bright sunlight . The smell of wet , heavy hay was sweet and cloying . Those few of us who had our lives and beings in the town  --  doctors and solicitors and schoolmasters and saddlcmakers  --  fancied ourselves men of the world , readers of newspapers , discoursers upon events But notp343one of us was far removed from the land , and in our boyhoods had learned to read skies and roots rather than journals . Indeed , even in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The publicans were discovering that the strong-farmers were no longer summoning up rounds of drink in the old lavish way , and the saddlers that they were making do with what they had , mending and improvising . There was less call now upon Donald Considine , the Catholic doctor , for the treatment of every ailment : now the country people were once more content to apply themselves to the " black bottle , " which had never lost favour with the old , that potent mixture sold not in the chemist 's , but across Tully 's counter , in a jet-black bottle , the ornate label bearing a wide-ranging list of afflictions . " You see now how it is , " I can imagine Bob saying to me . " The very heavens conspire with the Tullys . The potatoes rot at the stalk and up go the sales of Father John 's mixture . " That observation I imagine rather than remember , but in truth I recall from those years the ruinous economy and Bob 's ill humour as intertwined . He was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then in another , and once or twice against me . Never , so far as I could judge , against Agnes , although who can say how married people deal with each other behind closed bedroom doors ? Yet surely his manner towards her in public was not merely courteous but affectionate , and such matters are not easily feigned before close friends . Agnes doted upon him , so Mary more than once informed me , and I had no need of the assurance , for when he handed a book or a cup , her small white hand would linger upon his a moment or two , and her wide pale eyes would seek out his . The nuns in the Cork City convent had given Agnes a dutiful love of fine music , and the skill to play and to sing it with a winning sweetness . Once or twice she had played for us , coolly and accurately , sitting erect in one of those dark gowns which she wore by preference . When it came to the piano , my Mary was ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tunes which I brought down with me from the Derrynasaggarts , and what she lacked in authority , she made up for by energy and wit . But Agnes , plainly , was fulfilling a social obligation and drawing scant delight from it , so that after a bit , we ceased to pester her upon the subject . And yet when Mary played , or Vincent , she would attend with a sweetness that won our hearts , Mary 's and my own , and her eyes rested with pleasure upon each of us , but settled at last , always , upon Bob . And if the instrument upon which Mary was playing , or Vincent , was not ours , but rather the awesome instrument which had been brought to the Delaneys from Dublin , by sea to Cork City , and then , by carefulp344stages , to Macroom and then Kilpeder , its sleek , sumptuous wood the visual texture of satin , but warm and living to the touch , then Agnes 's pleasure would move beyond this circle of friends , to encompass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , woods glowing in lamplight . " Jack of all trades , " Vincent would say , as he rose up after playing " The Rakes of Mallow " or " The Kilruddery Hunt , " or occasionally , without warning , catching us , Schumann or Schubert , playing very well indeed for one without formal training , with both feeling and intelligence , but with an eye cocked towards us , as though to say , " What think you of this , lads ? " But he was with us less often than we wished , for it was on the Friday night or the Saturday that we would gather , ourselves and a half dozen others , Donald Considine and his wife , Brian Roche , the town 's other Catholic solicitor , and Larry Saurin , the lesser of the two Protestant solicitors , a decent , dim fellow , with a fund of faded pleasantries . And on the weekends , Vincent was most often otherwise engaged , visiting , in accordance with the season , at fishing lodges or shooting boxes through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far afield to Connemara or Donegal . At times he would be away for weeks upon end , to Dublin or London or the Continent , whence he would return with funds of anecdotes , hints , winks for the men , and for the ladies , for Agnes and Mary , accounts of fashions and boulevards , churches tucked way in odd corners of the countryside outside Paris , or a descriptionof Versailles , myriad-roomed , a Babel of vanity touched by the vengeance of man , not God . " I was once , " he said  --  to Bob and myself , that is  --  in the snug of the Kilpeder Arms , " I was once upon a small tour of Versailles , and the very next week I was in London , walking along the Thames , with the Tower behind me , facing Parliament and the Abbey . A bracing experience . It teaches one who rules the world in this century , a walk along the Thames does . Lads , how did we ever bring ourselves to think that we could face up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " We were younger , " I said . " Fellows in our twenties . " " Even lads in their twenties should have better sense , " Vincent said . " But sure the cause was a good one . I have no regrets ; none of us has . Out and make way for the bold Fenian men , ' as the song has it . You know that song , do you not ? " he said to the ginger-headed young barman . " Well , here are three of us , the bold Fenian men . " The barman looked up from the glass he had been polishing , and smiled at us . " Can you answer me ? " Vincent said in challenge , almost with an under edge of anger , to Bob.  | " As Hughie says , " Bob said , in a tone which gave a full stop to our words , " we were younger . " Bob walked me home that night , for I had taken a pint or two more than was convenient , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snug , the warmth of masculine friendship . It was a winter night , crisp and cold , and the heavens starry . " He is forever in Paris , that fellow , " I said , " if he is n't in London . T is well for him . Operas and theatres and museums all spread out before him . " " Opera , bedad , " Bob said with a delighted yelp of a laugh . " T is the women of Paris that he has spread out before him , one by one for the most part , on soft mattresses and creamy sheets . Sure , who among us would not haste away with such a goal beckoning ? " " Do you think that ? " I said , disbelieving and with an obscure fear . Vincent to be sure was great for talking about women  --  " a certain pair of dark eyes in Paris , " that sort of thing  --  but always with a music-hall twist to it , a joke , an affectation of manliness . But there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the words themselves . We had paused , just at the point where that side of the square becomes the Macroom road , and a bit before the turning into Chapel Street . " Of course I think it , " Bob said impatiently . " Why should I not think it ? Vincent is unmarried and he has the usual equipment , and enough money to carry him to the brothels of Timbuktu , never mind Paris , should he fancy something a bit out of the ordinary . But Paris suffices , or so he tells me . " " He tells you , " I said , foolishly repeating him . " He was having sport with you most likely . " " Having sport indeed , " Bob said , " but not with me , I thank you . " To this day , I can remember the feelings which suddenly took hold of me there , as though Bob and Vincent had moved swiftly a far distance away from me , and there was naught between us but empty space . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob , like one of my own pupils . " It would not be exact , " Bob said , " to speak of him as a whoremaster . I lc has too many other pursuits  --  hunting and shooting and squiring ladies . But our Vincent is a lively lad , and what the ladies will not proffer to hint freely , he does not scruple to buy . Like many another . " " Yes , " I said bleakly , and it was only then that Bob recognised my unease . 1 le scarcely could study my features , in the moonless night , but he caught my tone . " Good God , I Iughic , " he said , " I have shocked you . That was surely not my intention I thought you knew , but how could you ? " " Vincent and I have never talked of such a matter , " I said , " although  |p346I  thought that we kept nothing back from one another . " " Then once at least , " Bob said , " that took an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , when he came back from London with a dose , and he was up to Dublin once a week to have it attended to . He did n't dare go to see Considine , and he was trembling lest old Tully learn of the matter . " He laughed . " There was no other matter that he would talk of with me , morning or night . " " Ah , " I said , " and did things come right in the end ? " It was , I trusted , a manly , offhand question . " So it would seem , " Bob said . " At any rate , he stopped talking about it , thanks be to God . The symptoms are most unappealing , at least to fastidious chaps like ourselves . " He slapped me on the back , and the awkward moment passed . We resumed our walk , for the short distance that was in it , but found little to say , a companionable silence . Rural Ireland , whatever may be said on its behalf by sanctimonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature  --  couples courting behind the hedges , and on occasion carrying courtship too far . We had our share , that is , of marriages arranged by circumstances , and on occasion a terrible fate awaited a frightened girl who struggled to give birth alone , in darkened barn or in shed smelling of rotten hay and rusty iron . We had worse indeed than that , things unmentionable but of which all of us knew . And as for the gentry , the legends which clung about them were sulphurous  --  of riotous parties , and of squireens with their tally women  --  and few were the baronies of Munster which did not have a story left over from earlier times , from the bad , ended century , of some landlord who did not scruple to exercise the droit du seigneur . The story is told about a desolate manor house halfway between here and Macroom , derelict and windowless , the chimney fallen , where girls would be taken , bound and lamenting . No , I had my full knowledge of such human nature as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet , absurdly , I had not imagined it within the circle of my days . For a married man , I must have seemed , to Bob and Vincent , absurdly innocent . At my gate , we paused , and although I asked Bob in for a parting glass , we both knew that it was late , and he declined . " Hughie , " he said , " I have been talking out of turn . You will not think the less of Vincent . " " No , no , " I said . " It is not that at all . Not that at all . " Nor was it . What troubled me was outside reason , and had no name . It was as though Bob and Vincent shared a world of experience , sensation , textures almost ,  |p347from  which I was excluded . I wanted no part of it , and yet I felt shut out , a breach in our friendship . " I wonder , " I said with malice , " that you could not contrive reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever . " He answered my malice with a bluntness that had its own edge . " I am a married man , Hughie . And in the days before my marriage , I could scarcely have afforded a trip to France . I contented myself quite comfortablywith the whores of Cork City . " And with that he turned upon his heel , and walked off to his handsome and well-appointed house . It was as though we had been caught in a mysterious quarrel , the terms of which were known to neither of us . When next we met , we made no reference to it , but were our old intimate selves , and yet such passages always leave marks upon a friendship , like scratches on a varnished surface . That night , late or not , I poured myself a good measure of whiskey before climbing up to bed , and sat quietly drinking it , in darkness . The third of the years which rounded off the decade was the worst . The September fair of that year was crowded , as always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little of the laughter and jesting of other years , the human warmth , the sportive malice and delight in sharp trading . Some of the fellows who stood that day in the market square had been travelling about that month , from fair to fair , from Millstreet to Macroom and from Macroom to Kilpeder , looking for what other years had schooled them to think a decent price . But the bottom had fallen out of the market , and there was now an unreasoning anger of one man against another , farmer against farmer , farmer against dealer . When a bargain was struck that September day , the old custom was but seldom observed , the two fellows spitting each one into the palm of his hand , and then the two clasped hands . This day it was more often a curt nod upon each side , and the dealer making a scribble upon his folded square of paper . That year , the dealers drank in the Kilpeder Arms and the strongfarmersin Conefry 's , with little traffic between the two . Along the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up their stalls , with ribbons and thimbles for sale , religious pictures in heavy ochres and magentas , save for the Virgin in her white and pale blue , bags of boiled sweets for the children , chapbooks with the " prophecies " of Columkille and Pastorini , small wrappings of sachets to bring home to wives and sisters . The women whose stalls they were would have places allotted to them by tradition , and for the September fair , some of them had come from Killarney and from as far away as Kanturk and Dunmanway . They had a great way with them  --  great strapping women , the most of them ,  |p348with  black shawls and red petticoats , and leather lungs with which to bawl out their wares . But that year , they shouted in vain , and their customers were few  --  a strong-farmer swaggering out of Conefry 's with a bladderful of porter , or a foolish labourer . They gathered together towards evening , therefore , in their twos and threes , arms crossed , to discuss the bad season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady pelting , and they flung cloths over their barrows and trundled them away . The public houses and the hotel had still their trade , but the square now was empty , with the rain beating down upon it , a cheerless spectacle . It was the same that autumn across the breadth of Munster . Across the Shannon , in Connaught , it was worse yet , as we were shortly to learn . " Next year " was a phrase much used that year  --  next year things would come right again , the summer clear-skied and bountiful and the distant markets eager once more for Munster cattle . And next year , i 88o , was indeed to be different , although in ways that few of us expected . I have seen it set down in print that just then , in the very months and weeks of which I have been speaking , Ireland moved out from her long , shadowednight and into the daylight glare and noise of history . A foolish notion indeed , for the eighties did to be sure bring us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the island had not been altered in one way or another , in fortune or in mind ; but it had shadow as well as light , mysteries , and unexpected turnings . At the time , of course , we had no notion of what was beginning . For us , if I were to name now a beginning , it would be in early October , a few weeks after that wretched , comfortless fair , when Bob was summoned to the police barracks , where a fellow named Mick Docherty was awaiting his removal to the gaol in Macroom , upon a charge of attempted murder . In the event , he travelled himself to Macroom the next day , riding there in advance of Docherty and his guards , and returningat about nine that night . He went first to the barracks , and then to the Kilpeder Arms , where he had a cup of tea laced with whiskey , and then to my house , where I poured him a second whiskey , while Mary went off to the kitchen to boil an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither Mary nor I thought it curious that it was to us rather than to his own house that he came . Indeed , we had been expecting him , without quite knowing why . By now , all of Kilpeder knew of Docherty 's arrest , and knew also that he had fired the two barrels of a shotgun at another Mick , Mick Tobin , at close range , one of the charges smashing Tobin 's shoulder into a mess of blood and meat and splintered hone . Conefry 's had been full of talk of it when I looked in earlier that night ,  |p349and  with each telling the explosion resounded more loudly , and the gouts of bloody flesh leaped higher . " Conefry 's patrons are an imaginative lot , no question of it , " Bob said , when I described the scene to him . " In truth , there were no witnesses at all . Docherty walked across a wet field to Tobin , and when he thought that he was close enough , he shouted and then cut loose with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay there bellowing like a calf until one of his sons found him . " " How is he ? " I asked . " Which one ? Tobin ? He will recover , Considine tells me , but the shoulder will not . He is badly maimed . " " Dear Jesus , " I said . " Exactly , " Bob said dryly . " And how is Docherty ? I left him sitting in his cell , with his hands on his knees , staring straight ahead . He is in a bad way , but he drifts in and out of his senses , and I got a good account of what happened . " " And in the cell he will remain , " I said , " until the assizes ? " " And in one cell or another for long years afterwards , " Bob said . " When the sergeant went out to his farm to arrest him , he made a clean breast of the matter , and he made a statement in the barracks and signed it . " He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What possessed him ? " I said . " Had they been quarrelling ? " " They had indeed , " he said , and then , just as I was refilling our glasses , Mary called to us , and we carried them down with us to the kitchen . " Yes , " he said , carefully tapping the egg with his spoon , as though the shell held mysteries captive within it . " They had been quarrelling . Docherty is to be evicted from his farm , and Tobin intends to take up the lease . Now that I reflect upon the matter , it may have become moot . The law has removed Docherty away from Kilpeder entirely , and from what the police and Considine tell me , Tobin has been ruined for the ploughing . His sons are too young . " He smiled at me , and I could not resist a grin myself . " I am ashamed of you , the two of you , " Mary said . " T is no subject for jests . A man shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell . You have been in cells yourselves , the two of you . Did you relish the experience ? " " We did not , Mary , " Bob said . " Not at all . " " I do not think I know them at all , " Mary said . " Neither of them . Has Docherty a family as well ? " " Oli , lie does , " I3ob said . " I le does indeed . A wife and seven chil/dren , and he still young , more or less . And he has a brother off in America . Chris Docherty . Christopher . Does that name sound familiar at all to you , Hughie ? " I shook my head . " There are two of Tobin 's lads in school to me , and two of Docherty 's . Lately there has been bad blood between them , and I never thought to ask the cause . " " I can tell it to you easily enough , " Bob said , as he cut in two one of Mary 's immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Ardmor 's tenants , as his father had been before him , holding on lease a farm of thirty acres southwards of the Killarney road . Where they had come from before that , no one knew . In the early years after the great famine , when all that region was depopulated , Pat Docherty appeared in Kilpeder , a young unmarried man , with enough cash on him to persuade old Everard Chute , who was then the estate agent , to make over a lease to him . The cabin on the holding was still standing , and into it he moved with all his possessions crammed into a bulging bag made from carpeting  --  a vest , some shirts , a missal , a rosary , and a leather bag of gold guineas . Within days of the shot that he fired in Tobin 's field , the history of Mick Docherty 's family had become Kilpeder legend , and even today , with all of them long gone , you can hear it rehearsed . The missal and the rosary and the leather bag I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairy tale , like the legend of the first Tully rising up out of the mist . But that old Pat Docherty was a stranger to Cork I can well believe . It is not a Cork name at all , nor even a Munster name . It was a family that kept to itself , and when it came time for him to marry , he left Kilpeder for a month , and came back with a girl from Adare , in Limerick , whom he had all along intended to marry , and who told neighbours that they had met some years before , when Pat was a gamekeeper on Lord Dunraven 's lands . But there was little else that they learned from her , as though Docherty had put a stopper on her tongue . " They were a curious people always , " I one night heard one of the neighbours , Dinny Loftus , say in Conefry 's . " Decent , helpful people always , and courteous . But they kept themselves to themselves , if you know what I mean . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man walking through a wasted countryside , picking and choosing from among the farms of those who had died or had been swept away , God rest them , and then walking with his bag of gold to the gates of the Castle . " " T is said that luck never follows a grabber , " one of the drinkers said to Loftus , " and now , in the heel of the hunt , there is Mick Docherty in Macroom Gaol for shooting a grabber. "  | " He was no grabber , " Loftus said fiercely . " By God , old Pat Dochertywas no grabber . My own father took up the fields which marched beside Docherty 's , and you nor no other man will call my father a grabber . The poor souls had all been swept away , I am telling you , and the fields had gone back to nature . They are buried in the famine graves at Tullynally , the men who had worked those fields . " " Ach , to be sure , to be sure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dinny . But Mick Tobin , now , " and the drinker swivelled his head , hat-crowned , to left and to right , lest any of Tobin 's chums be in earshot , " he was prepared to grab . " And so he was . A part of the story as Bob told it to me that night , the plate of crusts and hardening yolk thrust back , and the bottle brought down from above to the table , he had already known , and the rest of it Mick Docherty told him in Macroom , sitting almost motionless , looking ahead of him . In ' seventy-seven and again in ' seventy-eight , Docherty , like others , had sought an abatement of his rent , but Edward Chute had refused all of them . He was not acting alone ; the estate agents of West Cork and some of those in Kerry had been consulting on the matter , and had concluded that abatements were not warranted , not yet at any rate . And the same judgement was made for this , the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chute and Docherty , in the estate office : tin boxes of papers , deeds , letters , yellowed notations a half century old , a century , piled forehead-high , Chute 's desk a warren of crannies , slots , drawers with small knobs of grimed , unpolished brass , and on the walls  --  framed in walnut and scrolled , heavy oak  --  estate maps , builders ' elevations , and , of course , the print of the town of Kilpeder whose legend declared that the town , and doubtless all who dwelt within it , were the property of the Earls of Ardmor . I know that room well . There is but one tall window , facing eastwards , with a view , beyond demesne , beyond walls , beyond fields , of the distant Boggeraghs . As Docherty described the scene to Bob , Chute invited him to be seated , and so the two men sat facing each other , their knees almost touching . Chute was a fussy , precise man , the caricature , almost , of an agent , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull , a heavy , pear-shaped body . In those years , he wore a suit of orange-hued tweed , and the links of a gold watch chain stretched across the belly . Docherty I can not sec clearly , for we never met . He was a large man , Bob said , and youngish , in his middle thirties , with heavy head and flat face . It was now that Chute told him of the decision he had taken , that an order of ejectment was being prepared . It would not he the first eviction that year in Kilpeder  --  there had been four or five others  --  but it would be the firstp352from Ardmor lands . Patiently , Chute rehearsed the matter with Docherty , proving to him as one proves a theorem in Euclid that the estate had no choice in the matter . " Patiently ' is Docherty 's own word , " Bob said . " Docherty has no quarrel with Ardmor or with Chute . His rage is all against Tobin , who had already come to his agreement with Chute that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been removed from it . He is still in a rage , and vowed he was in grief that Tobin is not dead . I told him to put a sock in that ; things are bad enough for him as they are . But was not Chute the cute boor , if you will excuse my language , Mary , to do a deal with a grabber before making his move . " " Less cute , " I said , " for him to give out Tobin 's name to a man in a fury . " " Docherty badgered it out of him . He told Chute that there was no man in Kilpeder so mean or so foolish as to grab another man 's land . Leave such tricks to other baronies . Very well , so , ' Chute said at last , out of patience . T is Mick Tobin . ' And there we are . " " And off he went then , " I said , " to his own place for his gun . " " Not quite , " Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unarmed , directly he left the estate office , and he and Tobin had words , as you may well imagine . Tobin is not in such pain that he has not given a statement to the sergeant . When they broke off , Docherty walked away , towards the road , and then turned back and said , I will do you , Mick . I will blow you apart . ' " Bob picked up his glass . " T is then that he went off for the gun . " " It will go hard for him , " Mary said . " It will . Finding a barrister for him is an expense which he can ill afford , and which will serve little purpose . He will at least be snug and warm in prison . Better than walking the roads . " Bob drank off his whiskey without watering it , and slammed down the glass on the table . " T is a wretched , ugly system , " he said , " and Tobin and Docherty and Chute himself are but cogwheels that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ejectments , how can there not be ? One more harvest season of rain and cold will destroy this barony utterly . Who has the conscience to blame Mick Docherty because he was maddened beyond endurance and did what anyone might have done . But that is no defence in law . " He pushed back his chair suddenly and stood up . " I am but a rude , graceless guest , Mary , and I have a home of my own in which to he sullen . " " No , no , " she said , and put her two hands upon his arm . " Where the hell did Tobin find the money to take up the lease ? " Bob said . " There is the only mystery in the affair . That miserable farmp353of his own is half wasteland . Small wonder he plotted to claw his way free of it , the bloody grabber . " " T was a small enough ambition , " I said , " and look there at the price that he has paid for it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a poor way . " I know , Hughie , " Bob said . " I know . " He patted Mary 's hand with absent affection , and drew his own arm free . I walked him to the hall door , and as I was opening it , he said , with a dash of his usual manner , " You would make a poor lawyer , Hughie . " " I would indeed , " I said . " A lawyer , " Bob said , " or a magistrate , would ask how came a fellow like Mick Docherty into possession of a shotgun . And a handsome one at that , an over-and-under which would do credit to Vincent or to Major ' I'ownshend , with a stock of lovely walnut soft as velvet . And do you know the answer , Hughie ? By God , t is a lovely one . " He stood framed against the open door , light falling obliquely upon him from the open parlour . I shook my head . " T is a Fenian gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . He was one of the five or six fellows who contrived to slip away , do you remember , at the very end . He made it across the mountains , and in good time crossed over to the States . When things had quietened , his chum in Kerry got the gun back to the Dochertys . The old man never used it ; he kept it hidden in the thatch . But Mick took it down a few years ago , and oiled and cleaned it . God knows whose it was first off . Major Townshend , perhaps , in very fact . We sent the lads out to Deep Dene , do you recall ? " " I can recall no Chris Docherty , " I said . " No more can I , " Bob said , " and I have been racking my brain . Chris Docherty , I say , in the hope that a face will pop up , or a tone of voice . But the matter is beyond doubt . I met Ginger Hassett in the road today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris clearly and exactly , and even knows what became of him . He became a policeman in a New Jersey town called Passaic . " " A policeman , " I said . " Fine training for that we gave him . " " I know , " Bob said . " T is like when I was summoned yesterday to the barracks , and I thought how we had helped to bestow a new barracks upon hilpcdcr by burning down the old one . " For a moment , in mottled light , we smiled at one another , sober men in their thirties , recalling an extravagant youth . It was from this door that I had set forth for the Rising , that March morning . " Not that Mick has or had any part in the organization , " Bob said.  | " Fools , he called us , as he sat in his gaol cell in Macroom . I measured the judgement by its source . It seems that Chris was the older son . If he had not taken the oath , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a bit of gratitude . " " He has worries of his own , " I said . " Safe home , Bob . " But that night , as I lay waiting for sleep , the room black , and no sound save Mary 's quiet breathing , and faintly , the stirring of mountain wind , distant , a rising and falling sigh , I thought of Docherty 's shotgun . Almost , for all my dislike of weapons , I could see it , touch it . For a decade , it had rested in Docherty 's thatch , at last to be hauled down , oiled , polished , and used for what  --  against birds , farmyard vermin ? And now by a man driven to desperation . Eviction would indeed have set him out upon the road . He might perhaps have somehow scraped together the pounds needed for passage to America , but perhaps not ; perhaps there was only the workhouse . In my mind , in the sleepless night , I could see him , a man I had never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking towards Tobin 's , the gun awkwardly cradled . My sorrow , a distant sorrow without pressure , a sentiment , went out to them both , to both Micks , Docherty and Tobin . The sound of the wind slowly eased both of them from my thoughts . A gentle wind in the streets of Kilpeder , but carried down from hills where it beat fiercely from the ocean , tearing at furze.  | " I not only remember Bob Delaney well , " Myles O'Clery said , " I remember the first time that ever I saw him , at Morrison 's Hotel , in Dublin . A fellow bursting with energy  --  they were all there in that first year  --  Parnell , Davitt , Bob , William O'Brien , J. J. O'Kelly . I was with them , of course ; mark me down in your book as a Parnellite , ' whatever you decide that means . I was with him at the start , and I stayed with him to the close , which damned few did , as you know . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than your father by six years or so . I remember when your father was called to the bar  --  a handsome man , your father . But so , by God , was Parnell . He could have made his living on the boards , playing cavalry majors , Hungarian barons , elegant French lovers , that sort of thing . Now that I think of it , I would call Charles Parnell and your father the two best-looking Irishmen of their clay . They could never have said that of inc . ' I'ini Healy , God curse his mean little heart , used say that Ip356put him in mind of one of the walruses in the zoological gardens . Close enough , I daresay . " O'Clery was an aging walrus now , his days at the bar and on the hustings far behind him , enjoying his long summers at the rambling fishing lodge in Connemara , surrounded by barrister sons , solicitor sons , the one son professor of classics at the Royal University , daughters-in-law , grandsons and granddaughters . In Connemara , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brogues , long woollen stockings , but impeccablewhite shirts , neat ties of black silk . He had met Prentiss 's train in Clifden , the capital of Connemara , on a day of improbable sunlight , the distant Twelve Bens glittering , the air bright , the sky a delicate blue , cloudless . " You 'll not mind , I trust , " he said , " that I am putting you up at the Highlands Monarch ; it is a very decent hotel , of the old sort , if you know what I mean . Johnny Lavelle manages it , a decent fellow . Two weeks ago , I could have put you up at the lodge , but now every nook and cranny of it is filled with the generations of O'Clerys . If I could find a bed for you , the noise would drive you mad . You have brought no rod with you , I see . No matter ; we have them by the score . My God , what weather you have brought with you , would you look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought the lodge in ' eighty-one , on the strength of my fees from the Sherlock case . Sherlock versus Sherlock . The Irish equivalent of Bleak House . It went on for years . Your father found a few guineas wedged between its ribs . " Prentiss was at home with the old man . He remembered , from childhood , driving over to the lodge with his parents , from their own summer place on Lough Corrib , near Oughterard . A younger O'Clery , the swellings beneath the tweed more restrained , would be waiting for them on the steps . The voice was the same , a voice anything but ponderous , a grasshopper 's voice , thin and sprightly , leaping from one point to the next , delighted with itself and with the world . Once , home from school for the long vacation , as their carriage rolled along the miles from Oughterardto Clifden , beside them the lovely , reed-fringed lake , Prentiss had said , " He is full of fun , Mr. O'Clery is . " His father , reins held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him slantwise and smiled , a bit grimly . " Fun , do you say ? Indeed , indeed : We are old friends , Mr. O'Clery and myself . But have a care with him . Ilc is as cute as a . . . " His father paused , as though baffled for a simile . " We marched forward together , Myles and myself . Ile was just gone front Clongowes by the time I got there , but we picked up a friendship , first in London and then here , iii the law courts "  |p357Curious  , Prentiss had thought , his father and Mr. O'Clery schoolboysonce at Clongowes , as he was now himself , walking the same cold , whitewashed corridors . " Saw eye to eye in politics , as well . Or at least , I thought we did . But the Split found us on opposite sides . Without damage to our friendship , thanks be to God . More than most can say . That break will never heal . I t will ruin the country . Ruined it already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lip , and laying the whip , absently , against the flank of the lead mare ; but in Connemara his spirits were rarely depressed for long . " Myles O'Clery , " he said with jovial vehemence , and he peered ahead through light , silvery , sun-flecked rain , towards Clifden . Now , on the second lap of that journey , from Clifden to Ballyconeely , Myles O'Clery spun out a companionable web of words , no need for a response . " But we shall have time to talk , " he said , " all the time in the world . I have laid down orders to the O'Clerys . And you 'll be taking your meals with us , of course . I should from the start have picked you for a scholar , Patrick , but your father was always so certain that you were destined for the law . " " I may yet , " Prentiss said . " There is time . " " All the time in the world , " O'Clery agreed . It was as though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It has been a splendid summer , " O'Clery said . " More like Tuscany than Connaught . If the weather holds , there will be a splendid harvest . The farmers here can use it , poor devils . At the best of times , Connemara is better for holiday visitors than for the poor locals . But this year is grand , t hanks be to God . " Beyond the lake , the hills were blue ; sunlight struck from flat , rainpolishedrock . Bogland ran beyond the far shore . " Not like ' seventy-nine , " Prentiss said . " ' Seventy-nine , " O'Clery said , puzzled , and then his brow cleared . " Ah , " he said , " the scholar at work . No , no indeed . I did not see Connemarathat summer , but the stories were pitiful . I was in Mayo that autumn , and that was bad enough . Donegal was in dreadful shape . God spare the poor Donegals , ' they still say in Tyrone and Fermanagh . It was famine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munster were hard-hit . People like ourselves , Patrick , we have no notion of what a season or two of ruined harvests mean to these people . The O'Clerys have never lacked for a roast on the Sunday table , nor the Prentisses either . "  | " Davit t brought you to Mayo ? " Prentiss said . " You were there from the beginning ( if things ? " " Not quite , " O'Clery said . " Not quite from the beginning . I travelleddown to Mayo with Parnell . By rail to Castlebar , and there was a crowd there waiting for us , with banners that had been run up in haste , green every last one of them , a colour that Parnell had a superstitious dread of . And a band , of course , playing The West 's Awake . ' As we climbed down , he asked me did the tune they were playing have a name to it . He was unable to carry a tune , and he had no poetry at all in his being . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What happened is proof enough of that . " Eyes suddenly narrowed , O'Clery looked at him with canted head hunched towards shoulder . " You take your politics from your father , I see . T is only natural . " " No , " Prentiss said , " not on that subject , at any rate . " A boy , he stood once more with his mother at the window of the Imperial Hotel . Crowds were shouting beyond , in Sackville Street . His mother was crying , quietly , eyes hidden by a square of lace . " Not on that subject , " O'Clery said , laughing . " As though for men of your father 's age and my own , there were any other . It has marked us all for life . Did we stand with Parnell or did we not . There were good men on both sides of the divide . I can see that now . Mind , he was a strange man , as strange a man as ever I have known . Did your father ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would have been . We were all of us Parnellites then , your father as much as myself . Indeed , two times or three , it was to your father that he turned for advice on matters of law . " Far off , towards the Twelve Bens , it had begun to rain , the air a mist ; but the sun was bright upon their road , the wonderful sunlight of the far west , remembered from childhood . It glittered upon strands of coral sand , waters of aquamarine , darkening , band by band , as the eye moved out , beyond the empty bay , to the Atlantic . " Yes , " O'Clery said . " In the spring of ' eighty-three . In Parliament , there were Tories branding us with the Phoenix Park murders . They as good as claimed that Parnell had furnished the Invincibles with their surgical knives . And in the midst of it all , do n't we discover , almost by chance , that he had petitioned the Landed Estates Court for the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shooting lodge , everything . He was done for , mortgaged to the hilt and nowhere to turn . And so a fund was set up , committees formed , money coming in from the four corners of Ireland , and from England and America as well . By the end of the year , there was nearly forty thousand pounds collected . The great Parnell National Tribute . "  |p359O'Clery  began to laugh , a deep rumble welling upwards from a massive belly . It exploded as a high-pitched " hee-hee , " and he drew an enormous handkerchief from his pocket , shook it loose , and held it to his face . " Hee-hee , " he said again , and stopped the jaunting car , drawing away the handkerchief to look out across the water , a delicate blue . His eyes were dry . " The Parnell National Tribute , " he said again . " A great banquet was organized for the presentation . We were all there . I remember your father was there . The lord mayor began to speak  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first words out of his mouth than Parnell says , ' I believe you have got a cheque for me . ' Your man is a bit taken aback , but he nods and commences again . Is it made payableto order and crossed ? ' says Parnell . Yes , ' the poor mayor said , ' it is . ' ' You may hand it up to me , then , ' says Parnell . And so the man did . The cheque had been fitted into a large square , with shamrocks and round towers and perhaps a wolfhound or two painted upon it , the lakes of Killarney and so forth . All business came to a halt as Parnell carefully drew the cheque free from its surround . It gave him a bit of trouble , and he rose to his feet , but at last he had it , and he folded it twice or thrice , and tucked it away into a waistcoat pocket . Then he glanced up and saw the mayor standing there , open-mouthed , and he said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sit down . Enjoy your coffee and your cigar . ' Your father and Sexton and myself chanced later to leave the banqueting hall together , and Sexton was raging . ' A labourer , ' he said , ' would acknowledge the loan of a penknife more gratefully . ' And so he would . " O'Clery touched the horse with a light flick of his wrist , and left Prentiss to speculate as to why he had told the story . It was one of those episodes which had passed into legend , as though containing some truth about Parnell more absolute than language . " I met him once , " he said , " at my father 's dinner table . I was brought down to meet him , then I was sent back to bed . " O'Clery nodded . " And never forgot the moment , I daresay . T is like that gravestone of his in Glasnevin . A vulgar necropolis , gimcrack angels and shabby memorials ; then , suddenly , you round a corner , and there , upon clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the single word Parnell . " He turned towards Prentiss and smiled . " In death itself there was a kind of grace to him . A mysterious grace . " But not by the account given once of him as he was in that final year by Prentiss 's father . " The granite boulder was your notion , was it not , Mr. O'Clery ? "  | " Ach , " O'Clery said , " myself among many others . A large committee , the usual sort of thing , do you not know . But we did it properly , somehow or other . An appropriate memorial . " There was a finicking fondness for the appropriate detail which Prentiss , in earlier years , had not observed in his father 's friend . It comportedoddly yet attractively with his girth . " Do you know what I like best about Connemara ? " O'Clery asked . " Aside from the fishing , of course ? The scenery , you might well reply , renowned throughout Europe , and drawing here Anglican vicars from Surrey , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps would suffice for them ? T is the eerie and lovely silence , others will tell you , as silent as the Highlands of Scotland , but without their menace , their dark and sinister glens . True enough , but what draws me here , summer after summer ... " They had come now to the boreen which led off from the Ballyconeelyroad to O'Clery 's fishing lodge . Seven o'clock in the evening of a Connaught summer . The air had a still , intense poise , and the visible world was luminous . On either side of the road , hedges , tangled and leaf-heavy , shielded reed-fringed lakes , wet fields. ... summer after summer , " O'Clery said , " is that there is no damned history , no history at all . History is the curse of this country , Patrick , and t is sorry I am that I must be the one to tell you . Who would settle here when there was anywhere else upon the globe to settle ? The O'Flahertys settled here when they were beaten out of Galway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were beaten out by Cromwell . And there is the beginning and the end of the history of Connemara . Gone now , the lot of them . There is a ruined O'Flaherty Castle beyond Ballyconeely on the Roundstone road , and there is Dick Martin 's house at Ballynahinch . But the Martins are gone . In September , when we take the train back to Dublin , I shudder  --  history closing in upon me , like these hedges to our either side here . " The " lodge , " as the O'Clerys insisted upon calling it , as Prentiss himself had called it from boyhood , had been built sometime in the 182os by a Loughrea grazier , a Protestant , named Ticknell , who had been told of the beauties of Connemara by his friend , Captain John Darcy , the founder of Clifden . Old Dick Martin was dead by then , but his son was in possession , master of Ballynahinch , and there was a thin scattering of smaller landowners huddled near Oughterard . But there were few roads and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii Connemaraa house for the pleasures of summer , a lodge , vaguely Regency inp361design , white-fronted , with two frivolous mock-turrets . He went bankrupt in the early r 85os , and the lodge , sporting then the name Walton 's Rest , passed to a Birmingham factory owner , who rebaptised it Erin 's Repose . By the eighties , when his young grandson sold it to Myles O'Clery , ivy had begun to work its way beneath chipped plaster , and the black flagstoneswhich led down from the rere of the house to the lake path were cracked . By then , Connemara had been written up in all the guidebooks as " The Irish Highlands , " and it might have seemed dotted with such lodges were its vistas not so immense , its silences so absolute . Germans and Frenchmen came there for the season . The extension of the railway from Galway through Oughterard into Clifden made travel far easier . Families in groups and sporty bachelors in small parties would debouch at Clifden , where sidecars would be ready for them . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun cases of dark polished wood , fishing rods wrapped in canvas , the children carrying nets and wearing hats of wide-brimmed straw . They would pile into the sidecars , or if the party was a large one , on either side of an outside car , and Connemara would begin for them with the driver , in his old-fashioned swallow-tailed coat , breeches legs tucked into long woollen stockings , his speech thick and alien but comforting as hot porridge on a chill morning . The fishing hotel in which O'Clery had booked a room for Prentiss was two miles away from Erin 's Repose , a comfortable , rambling inn , with windows upon the same lake . At night , from his room , Prentiss could see lights , and in early morning hear the shouts of gillies . He took his breakfastsin the hotel , listening to the voices at other tables , loud confidences of the English , the gentler , conspiratorial complacencies of the Irish . Then he would walk over to Erin 's Repose for more tea . If the weather was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for gillies . Hours before , they would have slipped away , past rushes , in early pearlcolouredlight , a mist upon the water . Erin 's Repose boasted a dining room , with two tall windows looking out upon Mannin Bay , beyond hedgerows thick with heavy greens , with the reds and whites of late , fading blossoms . It was there that they took their tea . The O'Clerys kept no servants in Connemara . When the teapot was empty , O'Clery carried it to the small , crowded scullery , walking with heavy grace . " I think , " O'Clery said , " that I first saw Bob Delaney the day after Parnell and some few others of us had come back from the I , unerick meeting , which would put it at the very end of August or else the beginning of September . "  |p362They  were terrible weeks of low skies and rains , and by now there was the certainty of a wet , ruined harvest . I can remember , as though it were but a week ago , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the heavy rain commencing again at Limerick Junction , streaming down the glass , and upon the fields of tall , uncut hay and corn . The compartment was heavy with cigar smoke , and we had little to say to one another , the six of us , although we were tense with excitement . In those first weeks of the League , we could scarcely believe what we were saying or doing . All of us save , of course , Parnell . He was sitting nearest the window , in his suit of salt-and-pepper tweed , smoking one of his long , thin cigars from Fox 's of Grafton Street , with a pad of paper balanced on his knees , writing , pausing a minute , and then returning to the task . There may have been others in the compartmentwho imagined that he was composing a deathless oration , but I had reason to know that he was at work on one of those unpublishable scientific , as he called them , papers of vague geological import , efforts to prove that veins of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers were his only gesture towards a prudent management of his Avondale estate . But it could be argued that in Limerick he had made , or rather had repeated , a deathless oration . Certainly it echoes with us to this day . " Keep a firm grip on your homesteads , " he said there to the small farmers , the words coming very close to an actionable incitement to sedition . He had been saying as much , in one form or another , across Connaught and now into Munster . It had begun in June , with the meeting at Westport , in Mayo . Archbishop MacHale had warned his flock against attending a meeting " convened in a mysterious and disorderly manner " and " organised by a few designing men . " An astonishing man ! Eighty-nine years of age , a half century as archbishop of Tuam , but his hand had lost nothing of its cunning , a prelate cut along lines of the High Renaissance bias . The meeting had been called for Sunday , the eighth , and his lordship contrivedthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Freeman 's , so that every parish priest in Mayo and Galway could digest it with his lamb and cabbage . Parnell had come over from Westminster on the mailboat , and Davitt hurried over to Morrison 's to meet hint . It was an awkward moment for Parnell , a Protestant ; and invited speakers ,  |p363Catholics  the most of them , had all morning been backing away . " Will I attend ? " Parnell said to him . " Yes , certainly . Why not ? I gave you my promise . " At the door out into Dawson Street , Davitt almost collided into me . " By God , that is superb , " he said . " That man is afraid of no one or nothing . " There were ten thousand at least , at the Westport meeting . Five hundred of them were young fellows on horseback , " cavalry " they called themselves , who escorted Parnell from the hotel to the assembly grounds outside the town . For most of those fellows , riding along before the carriage or behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press as a quixotic sort of parliamentary moss trooper , remote Protestant gentry , benign supporter of Home Rule , a cause which meant little enough to the farmers of Mayo in that June of 1879 . It was a splendid day , one of the few fine days of that wretched spring . For two or three months , certainly since the Irishtown meeting in April , Davitt and his Mayo chums had been staging these Sunday - ueetings , and for better than half of them , the rain had begun to fall before early Mass , and by afternoon the field in Claremorris or Ballinrobe or wherever was soft and squelchy underfoot , and the green bunting sodden , cheerless . But this day was what soon the papers would be calling " Parnell weather , " Clew Bay sparkling beyond pastures green as limes , its score of islands standing out clear and distinct . Croagh Patrick loomed above us , a shaggy brown giant . Davitt and Parnell met that morning for breakfast at the hotel , and Parnell had me posted between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they met in the first year or two , at breakfast in a provincial hotel , or in a tea shop near Westminster , or in the smoking room of Morrison 's i --  Dublin . And it is thus that I remember them most clearly , as upon that late morning , Davitt calling in after Mass , and in the close distance the jovial shouts of the " cavalry " mustering with perhaps a Sunday pint taken but no more . We sat at a table close by tall windows which looked out upon the town 's handsome mall , designed by Wyatt in the old days , when landlords cared about the look of a town , as with the Parsons and the deVescis in the midlands , the Ardmors below in Kilpeder . God forgive us , we pulled down the power of the landlords , and a bit of the good went down with them , a bit of old decency . What have we left now but our own scruff ? And if the campaign against the landlords had anywhere a beginning , it was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shouts drifting towards us , and Charles Parnell and Michael Davitt facing each other across the teapots . A kind of buffer , so Parnell thought n-e . In those days , as again atp364the end , he had need of me . I was in those days one of the youngest of the Irish members , and a bit more svelte , a bit more sleek than the present finds me . A Home Rule member , to be sure ; but what did that mean ? Family is everything here , or all but everything , and my credentials were solidly Old Catholic Whig . My father 's credentials stood me in good stead : old Maurice O'Clery , Clongowes Wood College , a pal of George Henry Moore of Moore Hall , barrister , member for Meath , on circuit with Isaac Butt , a bagful of Latin tags , references to Ronsard and Rabelais  --  wideEuropean culture , as it was called . A Catholic but a gentleman , as it were . It was a pleasant life at Westminster in the seventies , especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is to be called a party . We had our principles , firmly adhered to : amnesty for the Fenian prisonersin English prisons , and a reasonable reform of the iniquitous system of land tenure , and of course , as our ultimate object , the restoration to Ireland of a measure of self-government . At the same time , to be sure , we made clear , or sought to make clear , our loyalty to the Queen and to the Empire . Indeed yes . We were a rare flock , and the House took great delight in us . Disraeli , for example , had a great fondness for Butt , and the two would have a glass of hock on occasion . I remember coming suddenly upon the two of them one night in the library of the House , heads bent and almost touching , bathed in green-globed lamplight . A brace of contradictories , I thought . There is the arch-Tory , rhapsodist of the QueenEmpress , and he is no Churchill , no Bolingbroke , but a converted Hebrew , the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his race as he sits facing me in profile  --  hooded eyes , beaked nose , the wispy beard of a high priest . A dandy once in his youth  --  waistcoats of puce and mauve , high rolled lapels of watered silks  --  but cool now in his dress : severe greys , more clerical than dove , and one hint of colour at the throat , flash of discreetly covered ruby at the wrist . And , head almost touching , shock of grey unkempt hair bristling into points , full , fleshy face , the leader , so England thought him , of rebelly Irish Papists , but in fact Protestant , an Orangeman in his youth , arch-Tory by birth . The Fenians converted him , so he often said , in those months of ' sixty-seven when he was defending them . Not to their cause , for Butt to the last day of his life was a Queen-and-Crown man , but converted rather by their sincerity , their certainty that nothing could help us save the pike and the rifle and the ambush . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted Gladstone , persuaded him that something across the Irish Sea was dreadfully in need of redress . They were allies in a way , Butt and  |p365Gladstone  , working for moderate reforms , whereas Butt and Disraeli , on the floor of the I louse , were at daggers drawn . But , in truth , the two ofthem had more in common with each other , the same playfulness and wit , the Tory Jew and the Orange Fenian . A bit too fond of the ladies and the bottle , a bit too careless with his purse . Poor old Butt . More than once , the hat had to be passed round to keep him from debtor 's prison , for all that he was leader of a parliamentaryparty and a queen 's counsel with a thriving practice . I have seen him sitting so muddled by brandy that he scarce knew where he was , twisting and retwisting his spikes of hair , his mouth open . But never in the House , mind you , and never at the bar . He was a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , in his way . That was our weakness as a party , so it seemed in a few years ' time , after Parnell had turned everything around . We were a party of Irish gentlemen , and the English made fools of us . At the end , we broke him . Not England , we did it . It had to be done , and Parnell stood aside and let us do it . When the end came  --  the end for Parnell , that is  --  I stood with him , and I remember that once he said , " The English need not destroy us ; we kill each other . " And I thought , You showed us the way . We sent poor Butt to his grave , broken , rejected . It had to be done . I remember Parnell 's first evening in the House , Butt leading him forward by the hand , pleased as Punch , the new member for Meath , and exactly the sort that Butt liked to see representing the country  --  master of his Wicklow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent name for a century or more . And there , I thought , rests the full total of his qualifications . And for all his handsome appearance , tall lean figure  --  he could have had any woman he wanted , why in God 's name did he make the choice he did ? He was nervous and hesitant for all of that session , scarcely saying a word . Well , thought I , he will go down in history as " Single Speech Parnell . " Once , your father and I came home on the mailboat together , and found ourselves joined by Old Major O'Gorman . Now , there was the old party in its finest flower . The old major , twice as fat as I am now , I give you my word ; but suits of the finest black woollens admirably cut , and a heard like Saint Nick , white as an angel 's wing , and above the flowing hoar moustaches , a nose of somewhat the proportions and precisely the colour of a pomegranate . Purcell O'Gorman that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called himself , the member for Clare . We took a stroll on deck , the three of us , your father and myself flanking the " bould " major . He walked with a swagger for all his heft , the belly flung forward like a fortification , and a stick almost as tall as a shepherd 's crook , ebony , with a ball of carved ivory . " The man , " he said , " is a disgrace . A disgrace and a my , story . " It was as calm that night as the crossing from 1 lolyhead ever is , butp366there was a thick fog , and the deck was slippery . " Night after night , that man stands on his hind legs in the House and disrupts its proper business . Butt has talked to him , but it is no use . Himself and that popinjay O'Donnell and Biggar , the vulgar little bacon wholesaler from the North . My god , what a trinity ! " That , of course , was how at first most of us responded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One night , I recall , after he had been talking for hours , for hours after long hours , he moved an adjournment of the debate on the grounds that he was not being heard with the proper attention . " You are right there , Parnell , " Biggar called out in that uncouth Belfast voice of his , a bulky-shouldered little hunchback . " I had begun to drift off myself . You have a most melodious voice . Best to adjourn , and then do the entire thing again . " And this , mind you , was the debate on the army estimates . Back and forth we paced , the three of us , the major and your father and myself , with the lights from the saloon splashing pale yellow into the fog . The major , almost , in the darkness , one could sense the quivers sweeping across his mountainous flesh . " The forms of the House , lads , the forms of the House ! " Parnell , do you see , and the small band he was gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parliaments , cradle of constitutional government , all the rest of it . One could expect little better from the others  --  Biggar and O'Connor Power . What were they but Fenians , sworn members of the Revolutionary Brotherhood ? But Parnell ! Look and manner of a gentleman , Cambridge accent . Butt sought at one point to disavow him , rose up one evening to declare that he could not control the conduct of the member for Meath , disapproved of it entirely , apologised to the House on behalf of the nation of Ireland . And Parnell , in the coolest manner possible , although not insolent , replied that it was to the nation of Ireland , and to that nation only , that he was answerable . " Damned puppy ! " the major growled into the fog , stabbing the planking with the ferrule of his stick . Your father and I made noises of assent . The major was a bit of a joke in the House , with his girth and his puns and his stories of dusty campaigns against Afghans ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit flattered . And yet a few hours later , in our cabin , your father said to me , " He is right , you know . " " Who , the major ? " " No , " your father said , as slowly as possible , as though with reluctance , " I mean Parnell . " His words came so pat upon my own thoughts that I was startled , and I began to tell him so , but he paid scant attention to me at first . " The English care not a damn for us ; they never have . If you want an Englishmanto listen to you , you have to seize him by the throat . That is what Parnell is doing , Parnell and Biggar and O'Donnell , t hat crew of his . "  |p367Good  heavens , Patrick , here you are , rooting about in some obscure town in West Cork , hoping to dig up history like a truffle , and all the time it was at home with you . Historic scene : young Prentiss and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fog covers Irish Sea . For me , and I told your father this as soon as he gave me space , it was a night in late May of 1876 . Some few of the Irish members were speaking for amnesty for the lads still in prison because of the rescue at Manchester , and also for a fellow who had long been suffering under harsh conditions in Dartmoor Prison , a one-armed labouring man named Davitt . Butt was strong for amnesty , mind you , but with the ill fortune that dogged him at the end , he had left the chamber , when Hicks-Beach , who was speaking for Government , made a sneer about members of the House who defended murder . " No , " Parnell said , in a sharp , clear voice . " No ! " " I regret to hear , " Hicks-Beach said suavely , " that there is an honourable member of this House who will apologise for murder . " This would have been for poor Butt a splendid opportunity for a half-hour disquisition upon evil conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true Irishman , and so on . But what Parnell said was so brief and so startling that I have remembered every word of it . I once refreshed my memory by consulting Hansard . " The right honourable gentleman , " Parnell said , " looked at me so directly when he said that he regretted that any member of this House should apologise for murder , that I wish to say as publicly and directly as I can that I do not believe , and never shall believe , that any murder was committed at Manchester . " I can see him as clearly as if it were yesterday . like many members , he had an engagement later that night , and he was iii formal dress , black worn carelessly , and the burden of his words was almost mocked by his tone , matter-of-fact and almost casual . But he had placed a powerful piece upon the board , for if no murder had been done at Manchester , then Allen and Larkin and O'Brien had been unjustly tried upon a capital charge , and unjustly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before him , and put on his tall , glossy hat . I was sitting aslant of him , so that I could see but a wedge of his face , yet I thought he was smiling towards Hicks-Beach , who had the look of a man just poignarded . It was as though a band of Fenians equipped with torches and scaling hooks had smashed into the House . We did have a few suspected Fenians , Biggar and Power , and they too were looking towards him , as though seeing him afresh . And that , in my own judgement , is why he said it . Where that Wicklow fox bunter drew his political shrewdness from is as much of ap368mystery as everything else about him . He was not speaking to Hicks-Beach at all , but was sending back a message to Ireland . " Trust me , " he was saying to the hillside men , to the thousands who ten years before had mustered by the shining rivers with pikes and stolen rifles . " I am no gentleman like Butt , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lackey . " Small wonder the rumour spread that he had himself taken the Fenian oath . But of course he had not . In the years to come he had dealings with the Fenians , no hesitations about meeting with them in this quiet place or that ; but it was a marriage of convenience . They used him , and he used them . And if there was loyalty at all , it came into play only at the end , when he was a hunted man , his back against the wall . Then they came down from the hills , as it were , to stand beside him . The Fenians had by then become addicted to lost causes ; but not Parnell . He played to win . Holyhead to Kingstown . In morning light , pearly-grey , soft through a thinning fog , the mountains rise up to you , Dublin mountains and the mountains of Wicklow , and the city buried somewhere safe from view , between water and gorse-purple hill . How much of our lives are spent upon that voyage , Holyhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland to England , and then back again ? Your father and I saw the sky lighten . We had gone back on deck , and spent an hour or so walking forward and aft , unencumbered by the major . Your father was not in the House , of course ; he was taking his dinners at the Temple , but was almost as involved in politics as I was myself . And we resolved , the two of us , that I should throw in my hand with Parnell , even shook hands upon it , a pair of pompous young patriots . Mind you , I could afford the gamble . I held a safe seat , as my own father had held it before me ; the O'Clerys have always been an unbudgeable family . And as we talked , Ireland rose up before us , to the west , the western isle , a faint line upon a broadening sky , brown beneath the pink of coral , beneath salmon . Impossible , now , in the holiday stretches of 1904 Connemara , for Prentissto see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrister and member of Parliament in mailboat , dawn upon the Irish Sea , lean against oak rail , peering through fog , through darkness , for a first sight of the hill of Howth , the Sugarloaf mountain . Now , looking at O'Clery with family affection , scholarly caution , he could see only Majorp369O'Gorman carried forward into modern times . Impossible to see through flesh with spectroscopic eyes to the young man who had gone back to the next parliamentary session , the session of 1877 , a sworn member of Parnell'screw , sworn to wreck Butt 's policy of moderation . And yet it was all there in Hansard : Biggar talking to the point of exhaustion , and then O'Clery taking over from him , the business of the House suspended for days at a time . He even earned himself a Vanity Fair cartoon by Spy which had hung in the library of Prentiss 's home  --  " Obstruction O'Clery , " Spy called him , a sleek young man , gently swelling paunch beneath trim waistcoat , bald patch the size of a golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letterpress , " who is one of Mr. Parnell 's brave hand of Hibernian speechifiers , prepared to liberate their beloved island by putting the House of Commons to sleep . " Yes , said O'Clery , this was in the smoking room of Morrison 's , at the corner of Dawson and Nassau streets . Parnell rarely stayed anywhere else , and so for a decade at least , its smoking room was an informal local parliament house , which did not entirely please the manager , because now the county families shunned it , limiting their patronage to Russell 's and the Shelbourne and the Royal Hibernian . Bob Delaney had written to Davitt , and Davitt had sent back a note to him . Not that Davitt was stopping at the hotel , not then nor for years afterwards . He was living on short rations in those days , a bit of cash that he had been advanced by the organization and whatever he was able to get by lecturing here and there on his prison experiences . When Bob came in , I was sitting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large round table in the corner . At the door , a waiter pointed out our table to him and he came straight to it . Not that he would have had trouble finding Davitt , who sat as he always did , at an angle to the table , so that the empty sleeve was in shadow . There were port glasses before the rest of us , I rejoice to say , and a bottle , almost cmpty , of that very decent crusted port that Morrison 's used to carry . You did n't find it there anymore . I do n't know why . But Davitt had his tall glass of ginger beer , a fierce temperance man . If prison does that , God shield us front it . Delaney introduced himself , and Davitt invited him to join us . He wearing a dark suit of which lie seemed rather vain  --  proud , no doubt ,  |p370that  it was ready-made , and not stitched for him by one of those itinerant tailors who are the plagues of Munster . He was a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features , and despite his nervousness , a ready smile . We signalled to the waiter for another glass . There was for a few minutes an exchange of trivia  --  the nature of the bad harvest in the southwest , and so on . " There is a bad harvest in the west as well , so we are told , " Delaney said . He had a quick , appraising eye , and it moved from one of us to the next , and round the room , taking in the draped windows and the tables , a party of commercial travellers at the far end . But it came back , always , to Davitt . " A ruined harvest , " Davitt said . " I saw one like it before , many years ago , when I was a lad . There can be no mistaking it . " For that moment , it was as though the boyhood in an English factorytown , the years in prison , had been washed away . A small child , one ofa ruined family , stood upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are not a farmer yourself , Mr. Delaney ? " Sexton said . " I am not , " Delaney said . " I am a solicitor . But my clients arefarmers , the most of them . And my brothers . I am of farming stock . " " Who is not , " I said , " in this country ? " When the waiter brought the glass , Sexton motioned him to pour it for Delaney , who accepted it with thanks , but left it sitting before him , untasted . " Not always a solicitor , I believe , " Davitt said . " Not always , " Delaney said . " I began my days as a shop assistant in Kilpeder . " " And not always a shop assistant , " Davitt said . " Mr. Delaney has been a gaolbird , like myself . " " For a few months only , " Delaney said . " Twelve years ago . Not like yourself , Mr. Davitt . " Davitt nodded , and studied Delaney with those dark , sunken eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he sported a long moustache , which dropped to either side of his mouth . What must seven years in prison be like ? Unimaginable . And yet he could speak of it easily enough : some incident might provoke a memory , and he would give it in a flat , uninflected voice . It was in that room , in the smoking saloon of Morrison 's , that Davitt and Parnell met for the first time . " I would not face it , " Parnell said , speaking to him of prison . " It would drive inc mad . I would kill a warder and get hanged rather than endure such agony . Solitude and silence are too horrible to think of . " Curious , that remark . I have often reflected upon it . We think of Pannell as a luau of silences ,  |p371of  solitude , and Davitt , the Davitt of those years , as always surrounded by others , talking and arguing . Of course , I thought , the words Kilpeder and Delaney clicking at last into place . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Full sixty men from Kilpeder town to the hills above did go . " Delaney and another man , their leader . Twelve years before , I thought . Country lads , shop assistants , a handful of Yankee officers . Snow had filled the mountain passes , cut off their retreat . Nolan , I thought  --  that was it : Ned Nolan . " With brave Nolan to lead on the van . " Now Delaney was a market-town solicitor , up iu Dublin for the day . Why ? " As I wrote to you , Mr. Davitt , " he said , " I would be grateful for an hour of your time . " " You are more than welcome to it , " Davitt said , and uncurled his hand upon the tabletop . " Perhaps , " Delaney said , " at some more convenient time . If that is all the same to you . " " As well now as later , " Davitt said . " These gentlemen and myself have been taking our bit of ease after a tiring few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , his legs spread a bit apart , and his hands pressed down upon his knees . After what seemed a full minute or two , Davitt smiled and said , " Very well , then , Mr. Delaney , " and standing up , he led Delaney away from us to a small table set between screened windows . " Gentlemen , " I said to Egan and Sexton , " we have been snubbed . " But Sexton was an old stager . " No , " he said . " But we are not members of the organization . " He drawled out the word , with mocking inflexion . In those days , or so I have seen it claimed , Davitt was not only still in the organization , but had been named to its Supreme Council . " The Firm , " it called itself at that time . Davitt was a member of " the Firm . " And Bob Delaney was still , in those days , a paid-up member of the brotherhood . It is ironical enough , in view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when Delaney made his approach to Davitt , it was as one Fenian to another . And yet the organization , as the world was shortly to discover , was suspicious of the league which Davitt was bent upon organising , and would soon enough drop him from the Council . By the time that Sexton and Egan and myself were ready to call it a night , Davitt and Delaney had pulled their chairs close together , and from time to time , one or the other of them would nod . Things happened easily iii those few years , and much was improvised . But it nevertheless tells one something about Bob Delaney , that he should have taken it uponp372himself to organise the Land League in West Cork , and that he should have gone straight to Michael Davitt for his support . Later on , in the late eighties , one would often hear it said that Bob Delaney was one of the coming men , that once Home Rule had been won and we had been given back our old Parliament House in College Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is not unlikely , although things worked out differently , for the country and for poor Delaney both . But as I stood in the doorway , waving a good-night to them , I saw , I must confess , a country solicitor , at once shy and brash , his manner stiff . And Davitt leaning towards him . Our old party , Butt 's band of " Hibernian gentleman , " was being challenged , by these fellows from outside and by Parnell from within . Prentiss had seen photographs of Delaney , mounted in a heavy album , mock-leather dyed red , or else in a box with others , lying loose together . One was a wedding portrait , Agnes sitting poised and thoughtful , small firm chin and level eyes , and Delaney standing beside her , his hand upon her shoulder , lightly , and his head inclined , looking towards her and not the camera . Another , his head and shoulders only , showed him as , by MacMahon 's reckoning , he had looked at exactly this time , and wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a tie elaborately knotted , unruly light hair plastered down . There was one group photograph of them all , beside the river : Delaneyand Agnes , the two MacMahons , and Vincent Tully . " There we are , " MacMahon had said , handing it over to Prentiss , " the lot of us . " They were making a picnic , in what must have been full summer , the trees heavy-leafed , and a wide white cloth spread upon ground which sloped down towards the river . MacMahon and Delaney , hatless , were stretched out full-length , heads resting on propped arms ; but Tully was standing , one hand resting against the trunk of an elm , his eyes shaded by the wide-brimmed hat which , MacMahon said , smiling , he had brought back with him from Italy . The two women sat together , stiffly , hands in lap . Mary MacMahon was smiling faintly , her eyes squinting against the sun . Dappled sunlight , leaf-fretted , fell upon the scene . " It is curious , " MacMahon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing it . There we all are , on an August Sunday in i 880 . So we will always he , until , someday , someone throws away this box ofp373pictures . A riverbank pastoral . And yet that was the summer when Vincent'sserious quarrels with his father about money began , his father indulgent as always , but vexed , with Vincent showing no disposition to settle down , and badgering the old man for funds for trips to Europe , or f or a shooting lodge in which to entertain his raffish county friends . And liob , see him there , stretched out at his ease ; but in those months the I , cague was claiming all his attention . We had to badger him to take the Sunday off . There was an edge to the afternoon . It was not tranquil , although it may seem so here , elm-shaded . There is another picture that goes with it : all of us sitting in a line , stiff and self-conscious , with my two lids sitting at my feet , young Tom leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a baby , his face invisible , hidden by an immense bonnet of lace . Where that picture is , I do not know . It was not a quiet summer , not for us , nor for the country . " " Not the summer of the great boycotting , " Prentiss said . " No , " MacMahon said . " That came later . In ' eighty-one . But the wheels were turning . The Land League swept all before it , like flames in an autumn wood . It all commenced so suddenly  --  here in Cork , at any kite  --  and few of us had a sense of direction , of where it would lead us , it how . And ' eighty was a dreadful year for people , you know . The distress was terrible , and yet the landlords did nothing ; there were few abatements . Across wide stretches of Munster  --  although not yet , thank God , our baronies  --  there were evictions , and land grabbing , and the rest of it . Neither did Government do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor . And always , for all of us , there was the terrible fear that the great hunger might be upon us again . But not upon schoolmasters and solicitors and the sons of merchants . We had our Sundays by the bank ( if the Sullane , the cloth spread , and meats and bowls of boiled eggs , and baked chickens spread out upon it . So the camera holds us , frozen in time , the paper yellowing . " " But he was a student of manners , our Bob Delaney , " Myles O'Clery said . " A half dozen years later , on the floor of the House of Commons , he was a credit to his nation , as the phrase has it . Not that the edges ever fell away from that West Cork accent , and his speech never changed , quick ; nod abrupt , challenging . He had a sly wit , you know ; a sardonic chap . But lie was at ease in the House , and he would not have been a disgrace in a Mayfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advantage of excellent instruction , although of that , the less said , the better . " Their road had taken them to Mannin Bay , distant from them by a stretch of coral sand . Early evening , and beyond the bay , on the darken/ing Atlantic , a trawler moved slowly towards Galway . Heavy clouds hung low upon waters , hills , the level fields which stretched to left and right of them . Despite sunlight , spattering rain fell upon them . O'Clery consulted a watch , flicking open its cover . " Six , " he said . " Kevin will be here with the trap in a half hour . " He held the watch towards Prentiss , detaching it from its chain of finely linked gold . " A handsome timepiece , is it not ? A trifle gaudy , perhaps , but the devil with that . " Prentiss felt its weight upon his palm ; his curved fingers moved along the intricate traceries of the opened cover . The Roman numerals stood clear and elegant against white . A raindrop fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prentiss dried it , and snapped shut the watch . The tracery , he saw now , surrounded the image of a stag , at bay on mountain crest . He handed back the watch . " Presented by our party , a few years back , " O'Clery said . " A quarter century of service in Westminster , sacrifices made for our nation . Damned few sacrifices , if you want the truth of the matter , but it sounded fine . He pointed across the road with his stick , towards a broad , flat rock . " Over there , " he said , " we can sit and take our ease as we wait for Kevin . A good lad , Kevin , and a good mind for the law  --  sharp and clear and entirely without imagination . " A grim paternal smile , part love , part derision . The Galway-bound trawler was a shape upon the darkening horizon . In companionable silence , O'Clery and Prentiss sat watching it , as they waited for Kevin O'Clery with the trap.  |p375Colours  and shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of autumn , and blues light as petals . The shapes seem imposed by the logic of necessity , lest the colours lose their purities , move against each other . But at a distance no greater than a few feet , colours and shapes resolve themselves , become river , path , an avenue of low-branched elms . " It is our river , your river , " I said to Tom , " the Sullane . Here in hilpcder . " Sunlight lay , great blurs of light , upon the water , an apple green moving towards thick-textured forest green , and grasses studded with flecks of white , wild flowers . " I like it , " Torn said , " I like this one . That is why I wanted you to sec it . " It was a fine room for painting , sunlight splashing in . Torn had carried the easel which held the painting to the tall windows which facedp376the terraced gardens , and beyond which I could glimpse the river itself , a stroke of silver in morning light . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : lovely the colours he had chosen , and the ways in which he had placed them against each other . But I secretly felt something to be lacking , not in this painting alone , nor merely in all that Tom had shown me of his work , but in the entire school to which he looked for guidance and direction . And thereby I confess myself an utter " Philistine , " a shameful confession for someone who prides himself upon being a bit of an artist in words , and who chooses words , his pigments , with a due regard for their weight , their colours , their legendary histories . Tom gave me his quick , crooked smile , as though he had heard not merely my word of conventional praise , but as well its unspoken qualification . The room was chill , and he was wearing a short tweed jacket , the sleeves pushed back as he stood over his cluttered worktable , cleaning brushes . The top of the deal table bore an accidental heraldry  --  splashes of cobalt , vermillion , obsidian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " Beyond there , " he said , " beyond the real river , as you would call it , one of our tenants has been shot . A man named Michael Tobin . A dispute about land . " " It is always a dispute about land , " I said . And so it is , whether here or in Sicily or in the high Pyrenees . " Yes , " Tom said , " but this time we are involved , in a way . Chute proposed to evict a peasant named Docherty from another of our farms , a better one , and give the lease to Tobin . " An ugly word : evict . In Ireland , its latinity had long ago been bleached out , and what leaped to the mind was the " crowbar brigade , " with their pickaxes and sledgehammers , three or four mounted constables to guard them , men and women standing on the roadside , the women barefooted , perhaps , children clinging to their skirts . At this point , I had never myself stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Evictionswere a part of the iconography of our imaginations , all of us . " The man who shot him is also called Michael , " Tom said . " Michael Docherty . He is in Cork City Gaol . " " Do you know him ? " I said . " Either of them ? " " I know none of them , " he said , placing the brush in its jar . " I know the servants , coachmen , the gamekeepers , bailiffs , the river walker . Not the tenants . When Sylvia and I came here , after the wedding , when the grounds were thrown open , porter and jugs of punch laid out on tables in the barns , they were all of them here , and Docherty and Tobin with the rest of them , no doubt . The best of friends . No , I do not know my  |p377tenants  . Did you know your father 's ? " " Oh , yes , " I said . " Yes indeed . But ours is a small estate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had gone with my mother , in the dog cart , to visit a sick tenant , an old woman named Harris . My mother brought her a hamper stuffed with cakes , jellies , preserves , a roast chicken . The old woman 's bed had been placed close to the fire , and she sat propped up . Thin white hair lay upon the pillow . Her eyes were rheumy . She frightened me . A woman of middle years , daughter or neighbor , sat beside the bed . When we entered , she leaped up and curtseyed , a full curtsey , bobbing low . I hung behind my mother , who said , " Now then , " briskly and cheerfully . She took the woman 's bedside chair . On a table by the bed lay a water glass , rosary beads , a photograph framed in wood . It showed a fierce-moustached private soldier , froggings and tall , stiff collar . While my mother talked to the old woman , questioned the younger one , I kept my eyes fixed on the soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have had a talk about it , " Tom said . " Not entirely an amicable talk , I 'm afraid . " He smoothed down his sleeves , and straightenedhis collar . " Chute is a decent fellow , as you know  --  honest , fair in his dealings with people . But he 's a bit of a landlord himself , most agents are , and apparently they have banded together , to resist any abatement of rent . That is what caused the trouble , is why Docherty shot Tobin . " We walked down , then , to join Sylvia in the morning room , but as we stood at the door , Tom turned back , to take a look at his studio . Perhaps his true life was in that room , a life of oils , pigments , brushes . Paintings by two of those Frenchmen of whom he was so enamoured hung on either side of the tall , undraped windows , colours and shapes , shapes and colours . When he left that room , he left himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicate wallpaper which had been there as long as I could remember , the choice of another bride , Isabel : pagodas and small , high-backed bridges , parasolled ladies , their faces riced , swift-sketched . Sylvia was not there , but one of the maids came in behind us , carrying a china coffee service . She rested it upon the long , low table . Tom seemed not to notice her . He had gone to the window , and was standing there , one hand upon its white frame . I thanked her , and she bobbed , a young , pleasant-faced girl . Beyond the window , I could see now , as I walked towards it , that Sylvia was coming towards us , through the gardens . She held a book in one hand , and with the other had caught up her skirt . Her dress was dark rose in colour , a morning dress , and she was wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat , tied loosely . A long riding coat lay upon her shoulders , unfastened . An autumn garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the gravelled paths . Morning mist had not quite clearedp378itself ; it clung to tall , bordering shrubbery . Sylvia was walking slowly  --  sauntering , rather  --  and now she stopped , bent down to a rosebush . She rested her book upon the path , and touched the bush with both hands . Autumn became her . All the seasons of the year became her , save winter . We waited for her , and when she was with us , she poured the coffee , then , leaving the saucer on the table , held her own cup in her two hands , and as she sipped from it , looked over at me . " Other visits you never rose so early , Lee , " she said . " You have learned bad habits somewhere . Not in Italy , surely ? " But before I could answer her , Tom said , " I have been talking to Lee . About Chute , and about Docherty and Tobin . " " Oh ? " she said . " You do not surprise me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the past week . " " Well , " Tom said , " it is a sorry business . Why should I not be concerned ? One of our people shot and another in prison , and it is because of us , in a way . Because Chute  --  in our interest , mind you  --  proposed an eviction , and because this wretched Tobin was willing to ... " " To grab the land , " I said . " To be a grabber . It might have done him little good . The people have a superstition , that a grabber 's land always fares poorly . I remember that on an estate close to ours , when I wasaboy ... " But I stopped for a moment , because by accident , Sylvia and I had caught each other 's eye , and I knew , as though by the occult , what we were both thinking . And she did as well , for she smiled . We were thinking , the two of us , that we were the children of small landlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficed him , as at present it did my brother . And Sylvia 's father , during his years in the army , had put his affairs in the hands of a town solicitor . I remembered the " grabber , " as they called him ; whether or not he was really one I can not say : a slack-shouldered , bearded man , constantly smiling , at least when he talked with us . Cook told me once that at Mass he and his family knelt by themselves , in the one pew , and that he was never in the public houses , save for a shebeen on the Mitchelstown road , which cared not who was served . And there , twice or three times a year , with his two older sons to tend to him , he would drink himself first into rage and then into stupor . " And he has had never the day 's luck , " Cook told my brother and me , " from the day he took up that farm . " But he was smiling whenever we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , he would whip off his hat , and hold it to his chest with his two hands , the smile pulling at the black , matted heard . " Yes ? " Tom said , impatiently . " When you were a boy ? " " I must be getting old , " I said . " Drifting into anecdote . But surely , Tom , Chute is not a harsh man , f le is fair ; you say so yourself . "  | " Docherty was badly in arrears , " Tom said . " Two years . And nothing for this quarter . We have had these three wretched , ruined harvests in a row , and they did for him . " " But not for Tobin , " I said . " Docherty did for Tobin , not the weather . " " It is a wretched system , " he said . " It is indeed . " " But not of your making , " Sylvia said . " Not of our making , any of us  --  or Chute or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , beyond terraces , garden , river , the town itself . " The system , " he said . " As though whatever we do , is done by us or to us , is to be referred back to the system  --  a failed harvest , evictions , gunshots and men wounded . Mortgages and bankruptcies , lads taking up the shilling to go off and fight the Zulus , a derelict estate , a bog reclaimed . It is all the system . " It was , as phrased in those outlandish terms , a caricature of these eighteenth-century machines contrived for the betterment of mankind , all wheels and shafts and sprockets , which at the far end spat out dandies , mechanicals , chimney sweeps . Derelict estates , he had said , and I rememberedone near my home : pier gates with festive sandstone monkeys couched upon them , paws to eyes , and thence down a short curve of drive to a roofless manor house , its windows shattered by the stones of urchins , a rain gutter hanging loose . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we have here on our hands this season ? Another hunger , the famine come back again if we are not careful . There are all the signs of it . I can remember my father talking of those last months , when it hung poised . The system . It has crippled Mayo already , and it will move south . Not the blight this time . Ind Government is again unwilling to do anything , nor the landlords . Private relief  --  Good God ! The Duchess of Marlborough is taking up a collection in London , holding musicales . Good God ! The system , you see , is not unduly disturbed by private charity . " I had never before heard him so vehement , nor so concerned upon a public issue . " A wretched system , Tom , no doubt of that . But we have no other . " " Have we not ? " he said . His back was still turned to us . " Have we not ? I have instructed Chute that there is to be a forty-percent abatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrears are to be excused for one year , and that there are to be no evictions for six months . Let us see what that does to the system . " Neither Sylvia nor I said a word , although I could sense Toni strainingfor a response . Presently , as though but to break the silence , I said ,  | " I am no authority upon the system , Tom , no professor of political economy . But I can tell you what it will do to Kilpeder . Save for two or three great personages like yourself , the Blakeleys of the Grange and the Pendletons , the landlords of these baronies are in a small way of business , and they are mortgaged to the hilt . Poor Mouser Lambert was not able to give a ball this year for his daughters . And those carpets of his a filigree of holes , like Dr. Johnson 's definition of a net . If he were to follow the course which you propose for yourself , you would some morning see the last of him , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart with what they had not sold off at auction . Is that what you want for a man whose father was friend to yours ? " " I propose the course for none but myself , " he said . " Ardmor can well afford the loss . We are solid . Chute admits that . " " Oh , Tom , " Sylvia said at last . " Can you not see beyond your nose ? Kilpeder can be nothing by itself . You are the great family here , and everyone looks here towards Ardmor for a lead . Every small landlord in three baronies will have it flung in his face by his peasants that they are entitled to the arrangements that the Earl of Ardmor , God love him , has come to with his tenants . " " But conditions are quite different here , " Tom said . " Surely they can see that . " I laughed  --  a bit rudely , I fear . " The tenants see what they want to see , and they are blind to the rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see only that you have gone soft , gone rotten , same as if you had married a Papist named Bridget McGinn , that you sold them out , because you could afford . to . " " You would be a standing reproach to them , Tom , " Sylvia said . " To your own kind , as they would phrase it . And surely you could not ask Chute to carry out such a policy , measures that would bankrupt him , were he to apply them to his own lands . " " And there is a bit more to it even than that , " I said . " A shotgun was fired to bring this about ; a man is wounded and another awaiting his trial . And in the aftermath of that shot , the great landlord of the barony , the big lord , abates his rent . There is a geometry which the peasants can construe without help from Euclid . " Tom looked from one of.us to the other , a kind of witty fury in his eyes . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of us to do , high or low , save bow down to it . Perhaps the system is but a totem . But our own eyes need not be blind , Lee . Ride out towards the Boggeraghs some misty morning like this one ; take a look at those wretched fields . "  | " I have seen them , " I said , and shrugged helplessly . " In this house or that one , " Tom said , " once in a great while , you will hear a word spoken , in passing , of the great hunger thirty years ago . Or one may ride past a famine grave some morning , coming home from the hunt . We have done it together , Lee , you and I. An ugly depression , and a single headstone set for a marker . But I will wager you that it is never spoken of in the cabins ; there are few legends that have sprung up about those days . Folk tales traffic in the terrors of the mind , nightmares , not the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , Tom , " I said , a bit put off by his easily purchased virtue . An hour before he was debating one depth of magenta against another , matching up leaf shadows . " You can not decide lightly a matter of this sort . It will have its effects upon the baronies , effects that you have not measured . " " Not lightly , " he said , " not lightly at all . I proposed a meeting of the men of property , and as coolly as you pleased , was informed that they are determined , all of them , to sit tight . Next year , perhaps , we may offer abatements . Next year , if there is another ruined harvest . But four in a row is unheard of , it would seem . One would suppose that they conducted their business out of Old Moore 's Almanac . " " They do , " I said . " Some of them . Tom , some of those fellows are mortgaged to the hilt . They are as ill off as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rents , they will go to the wall . " " But I would not , and yet Chute chose Ardmor Castle for the first of the evictions . I will not stand for it . " Sylvia had been watching us quietly , hands at rest in her lap . " Tom , " she said . " We do not know our neighbors well . Not yet . We are too often abroad , and for too long . " " You are not likely to know them , " I said , " if Tom pushes ahead with this . The landlords are a part of your bloody Euclid , Tom . " " What would you have , Lee ? " he said quietly . " I was here twelve years ago , " I said . " That March , the March of the Rising . You were away at Cambridge . A meeting of the county families was called , and I went along , your deputy , as it were . It was after t h e Arms Raid , and everyone had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the army seemed to know their business , but they would have none of that . They were persuaded that red anarchy waited upon the doorstep , and that I was prepared to temporise with it . " " Yes , " he said , expelling the word as an easy sigh . " Yes , I know . " " I am not certain that you do , " I said . " You have an estate which is immense by all standards save , perhaps , the Hungarian , and it has beenp382well managed for the family for three generations at least . You are not hanging on by your fingertips . After the great famine , twenty small landlordsat least were swept away from my father 's neighbourhood , and I daresay that the Encumbered Estates Act fell upon Kilpeder as well . These fellows  --  Chute and his chums  --  are n't villains from a melodrama . " " I ask you again , Lee . What would you have me do ? By next quarter , Chute will have a budget of names for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Send them to the workhouse or out onto the roads ? Tell me . " " You can not do that , " Sylvia cried suddenly . " Tom ! Lee ! My God , you can not do that ! " Her hand was at her throat . " No , " Tom said with a quiet anger . " I will not do that . My father did not evict , not in the worst of times , and no more will I. " No , I thought , Tom 's father did not . But what of his father 's father , who was my own grandfather as well , and our great-grandfather , and so backward in time to the first freebooting Forrester , with a commission from Elizabeth that amounted to a letter of marque , ratified in God 's good time by Petty . Compassion came late to this land , perhaps to all lands . " It was clever of Chute , was it not , " I said , " to see to it that the first eviction would be from the Ardmor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small landlords ? He has a sense of hierarchy , Eddy Chute does . " " So have I , " Tom said . We fell then , by common accord , the three of us , to talk of other matters ; what I can not recall . It is curious how clearly I can remember the china coffee service , and Sylvia 's hands moving above it , as clearly as I can that conversation , which was to have momentous consequences . It is not , I am persuaded , that memory is random , brutally indifferent , but rather that it has its own strict hierarchies , which are hidden from us . It was a week or so later , when I was in Dublin on business , that I encountered Johnny Lynam in the Kildare Street Club . Why I kept up my dues , I can not imagine , for I was so seldom in Dublin that I made almost no use of it . Because my father was fond of it , no doubt , and took me there for meals when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not in its appearance , God knows , but merely because we had been there together ; and perhaps it did in fact have a smell which brought him back to me : good tobacco , and properly tended leather , and , in the cheerless dining room , the smell of joints , beef , or mutton , the steam rising from potatoes , a rice pudding which he always pushed upon me . Nowadays , I daresay , if I shoved my head through the door , the first member to catch sight of me would belabour Inc with a jainhok brought back from the South African War.  |p383There  was a slight flavour of that future in my brief words with Johnny Lynam . I was in the library , as it is laughingly called , reading the Saturday Review and enjoying a cigar , when I heard the sound of someone flopping himself into the chair , close by , which , like my own , faced upon Nassau Street , with Trinity 's cricket pitch visible beyond the tall iron fence of the college . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heard you were back , " he said . " Staying with that cousin of yours . " Why Johnny Lynam should have ventured into a library of any sort I can not say , unless in search of a treatise on fly casting . Any more than I can explain his habit of telegraphic speech , chary of pronouns , and typical of his class . Perhaps it has been taken over by the squirearchy from the army , messages scrawled in haste and sent off by cleft stick . " Yes , " I said , in unnoticed mimicry , " been back a month almost . " " What 's he up to ? What 's Ardmor up to ? I 'm not the only one who 'd like to know that . " I guessed at once what was on his mind , but I looked at him blankly . " Does n't seem to realise that we may have a land war on our hands before too long . It has begun in Mayo . I would call what that fellow Davitt is about an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Fenian rebel loose upon the country , and what can you expect ? " " You are moving a bit too quickly for me , Lynam , " I said . " We were talking about my cousin Tom . Tom is n't a Fenian , in gaol or out . He is a peer of the realm , as the saying has it . " " May be wrong , Forrester , " he said . " You could set me straight . Be happy to make my apology . But what I have heard , in this club and down in Waterford , with my own people , is that Ardmor has chosen this as the proper time to go against the other landlords in his barony . Damned rotten timing . " " These are bad times , " I said , " bad for landlords and agents and banks and moneylenders , but infinitely worse for tenants . There will be hunger before the winter is out . I can not speak for Waterford , but I can speak for West Cork . I came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for North Cork as well ? Is your brother following Ardmor 's generous example ? " " No , " I said , " and perhaps I should not have spoken as I did . I am not a landlord , after all . In strict fact , I can only speak with authority for whatever chair I may happen to be sitting in . " Which was not entirely true , of course , for although I did manage to support myself by my pen , more or less , there were a few properties scattered about Doneraile and a few others close to Mitchelstown which made a considerable difference as I cast up my accounts each half year.  | " Mind you , " Lynam said , " these are bad times indeed . You are quite right . We all know what happened "  --  and he paused , in search of a word , his eyes straying towards the window , towards Trinity 's forbidding wall and railings , its bare-branched trees , the cricket pitch chill and deserted  --  " what happened then , back then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were unborn then , or boys away at school . Few stories were told to instruct us . There were the unmarked famine graves , mountainside hamlets of scattered , empty cabins , the thatch rotted and wind-scattered . Cryptograms . " Back then , " I said . " Not now , " he said . " We learn from the past . And a ruined economy would serve no one 's needs . Not ours , not theirs . " " Not even the moneylenders ' , " I said . He thought a moment , and then laughed . " No , " he said , " not even theirs . So take yourself back there to Kilpeder , and tell Ardmor to be a decent , sensible chap . He may fancy himself a  --  what is it , fiddler ? painter ?  --  but he has a position to consider . Time for all of us to hold the line , eh ? " " Yes , " I said , " I will tell him of our chat , " and buried myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , of course . If Tom 's plan to abate the rents had become already a story blown across Munster , then he had stirred up for himself a wasp 's nest of ill will . Johnny was still sitting there when I rose to leave , but his mind , a fragile barque , had drifted to other matters . " Spent three happy years over there , " he said , nodding across Nassau Street towards Trinity 's grey stones . " You took yourself away , off to Oxford , was n't it ? Glad I stayed here . Ca n't remember learning a damned thing , mind you , but it would have been the same at Oxford . " Burke , Swift , Goldsmith , Johnny Lynam  --  Trinity 's mighty host . As I was reaching the door , he called out to me , " At least you did n't go to Cambridge . Cambridge had the honour of suckling that beast Parnell . Been in Morrison 's recently ? Be worth a visit . Better than the Zoological Gardens . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket-of-leave men  --  and there in their midst , puffing on his cigar , the master of the Wicklow hunt , former high sheriff of his county . " Johnny shook his head , baffled . " Beyond me . " I was not stopping at the club , but rather at the Shelbourne , a two minutes ' walk up Kildare Street and onto the green . In Dublin darkness often brings with it a damp mist , breeder of nielancliolics , fragments of longing . The yellow light from our windows , the curtains not yet drawn , fell upon the club 's front , an endearing phantasy in what is called , in allp385seriousness , " the Venetian style , " with stonework showing monkeys playingbilliards . Eighteen sixty it was , the year the new club was built , that I first went there with my father , to test the pudding . Beyond the club , towards the Library , although the street was almost deserted a ballad hawker was trying his luck , a pile of broadsheets at his feet , and his choice new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looked as melancholy as the evening , a tall , weedy clap in an overcoat that fell to his brogues , and a shapeless hat . He was holding fiddle and bow in one hand . " Army ballads , sir ? " he called out to me . " Name your regiment . The ! Fusiliers ? " I smiled and shook my head , but dug into my pocket for a shilling . Encouraged , he said , " Songs of the hunt ? Name your hunt , sir  --  Kilruddery , the Blazers , the Black and Tans . Or your countryside , sir . I very county in Ireland , I know them all . If I do n't have them to sell , I have them to sing . " " Do you now ? " I said , holding a handful of change in my pocket . " Have you songs of West Cork ? " " Begod , sir , do I not ? The bold Thady Quill . ' Ye Maids of Duhollow . ' I have that one here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bit of singing thrown in . You must know ' Thady Quill , ' if you are a West Cork man . A most comical song . " " No , " I said . " Not that one . Nearer , say , to Macroom . " " Macroom itself I have , " he fairly shouted at me , as though stunned by the coincidence . " ' The Flower of Sweet Macroom , ' I have that oneprint for you , and I will toss in a rendition of ' By the Banks of the Sullane , I Chanced Once to Stray . ' Two shillings the lot . There you are now . " Near to Macroom , " I said . " Not the place itself . There are great songs of all that region that exist in the Gaelic , I have often heard . " He looked at me at last with a glance other than the professional . " I have heard that myself , sir . Not that I have Gaelic myself beyond poteen and asthore . And to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place than an excursion once to Cork City . " " A place called Kilpeder , " I said . Recognition flickered , pulled at the edges of his mouth , and then the eyes narrowed a bit . " Kilpeder , is it , sir ? Begod , sir , there is Kil-this and Kil-that from one end of the country to the other , and I have snatches of song for twenty , perhaps , of them . But a Kilpeder , and in West Cork , is it ? Now that is a new one on Inc . " " You disappoint me , " I said . " We take great pride in our ballad , and tell ourselves that it is known far and wide . "  |p386A  clever fellow , he risked a half smile , one that could be denied if need be . " Sure no one knows all the songs , " he said . " I 'll tell you what , " I said , and handed him a few coins . " There must be a florin or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the words of it come to you , bawl it out before it is too late . " He jingled the coins , and touched to his hat , in salutation , the fist that held his fiddle . I walked along , past the Library , and past the splendid mansion which the Duke of Leinster had built , in the eighteenth century , when it had seemed , for a few decades , that a history lay before us , and not merely behind , a lovely house , French in its proportions . I was strolling , and two young women hurried past me , respectable young women , so far as I could judge . Their skirts swept the damp pavement . I had not reached the turning before I heard him , the voice raised so that it would carry but not bawling out the song  --  a pleasant baritone voice , not too badly misused . The notes of the fiddle moved among the shabby words . The trees of the green were dark , bare-branched , huddled together and shielding from view the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hansom carriages between myself and the hotel , their drivers , top-hatted or bowler-hatted , gathered together for a chat . " When the snow fell fast in each mountain pass , from Cork to Aherlow , Full sixty men from Kilpeder town to the hills above did go . " It was an impressive effort . Sensibly , he did not extend it beyond those opening lines , and they lingered upon the air , calling to some fragment of memory . I turned around . A carriage pulled into Kildare Street , and at the same moment almost , the door of the club was flung open , spilling yellow light upon the mist . A party of noisy young fellows , six at least of them , came out from Molesworth , the most sedate of streets at most times , with its Bible societies and its Protestant mission societies . Sounds , the movement of people , bustling inconsequence , shattered the moment 's silence.  |p387by  Robert Delaney , SolicitorThe Square , Kilpeder , County CorkKilpeder , a market town in County Cork , will be known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the Derrynasaggart Mountains into far-famed Killarney . Perhaps they may remember a straggleof low dwellings and then a square with an obelisk that celebrates the coming of age of an English-descended aristocrat . But most likely , their thoughts will be fixed upon the beauties lying in wait for them : the lakes and soft mountains of Killarney , the pleasures of a boat drifting upon waters of deep blue , the splash of the boatman 's oar . They will not be looking towards their right , towards the more sullen mountains which are known as the Boggeraghs . Our world presents a smiling face to summer visitors . By mid-September , they have all departed , and winter is gathering for its slow ad/vance across the hills . Christmas comes to us , of course , in the dead of winter ; but in Ireland , as in all Christian countries , it has its special warmth . In every cabin , however humble , a candle will be placed in the window to guide the Christ Child upon his way to us . One can stand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch as first here , then there , a small light will leap into the mist . Presently , when it is dark night , twenty candles , thirty perhaps , will be fallen stars in the darkness . In most of those cabins , at midnight , as the eve of Christ 's birth moves to His day , the families , kneeling upon the earthen floor , will say the rosary together . The morning , God willing , will be crisp , with sunlight glittering upon frost . And on the day following , the feast of Saint Stephen , the young lads will set off with their cudgels to hunt for the wren , " the king of all birds , " as their curious chant has it . But in wide stretches of Munster and Connaught , the recent Yuletidebrought a small measure only of the season 's happiness . And with the rosaries were mingled prayers for succor . It is well known that Ireland has suffered a third ruined harvest , and it is rightly understood that great suffering for the agricultural poor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , how many there are , of those who no doubt are well disposed , sitting in Dublin or in Cork before cheerful blazes , who know , as hard and vivid fact , the nature and extent of that suffering . And it is to be wondered if they know how much this suffering , although brought by nature upon the people , is intensified by the harsh and savage system of landlordism . The writer therefore solicits his readers to come with him in spirit upon a journey which he made a few weeks before Christmas , to visit hamlets whose families are as sorely pressed as any in Christendom . Kilpeder lies , as had been said , upon the Macroom to Killarney road . But a half mile beyond the town , a second , and less known , road leads northwards , through the Boggeraghs , to Millstreet . For much of its windingand tortuous length , it moves through desert land , inhospitable to all save furze and mountain grasses , wild hare and mountain goat . High above , hawk and kestrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are farmed by a sturdy and tenacious people who speak the old language , Gaelic , and who cherish customs older by centuries than the Christmas candle and the hunting of the wren . Their dwelling places are as primitive as those of the herdsmen of wild Tartary , cabins made of stone and mud , and these are shared by cow and goat . The time which I spent among them , accompanied by a schoolmasterand local savant , who knows their language far better than I do myself , were days which oddly mingled a hitter discomfort and chill with thep389warmth that comes from an encounter with an instinctive hospitality . But what was borne mostly in upon me was a sense of a poverty such as I had never before witnessed , and which was now stretched to the extremity . Here , however , I must make a distinction , one to which I shall presently return . The district which we visited , Aghabullogue , stretches for some eight miles , between hills , and its ownership is divided , roughly , between two landlords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town of Kilpeder and of much else besides , and to the north are the holdings of Bartholomew Colthurst , Esquire , of Dunmurray House . As between the southern and the northern halves of this region , there is little to choose , the both of them bearing every sign of landlord neglect . There does exist , however , one distinction , and it a crucial one , a matter , I make bold to say , of life and death . For Lord Ardmor is giving to these , as to certain other of his tenants , a full abatement of rent for the present quarter . His motive for so doing is unknown to me , and I prefer to believe that he acts upon a simple principle of Christian charity , in accordance with Scriptural injunctions . He would in that case be acting in a manner contrary to that of his ancestors , both remote and immediate , for the Ardmors have never been known as " good " landlords , whatever may be meant by that toadying phrase . It is sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other landlords , and also , it is believed , of his agent . Mr. Colthurst , to the contrary , is at one with his class , sharing its selfish lack of concern . At this moment , he is no doubt looking forward to the comforts of the Christmas season , as these may be enjoyed behind the thick walls of Dunmurray House . Turf fires will be roaring in its fireplaces , and from its cellars will be brought up cheering bottles of sherry and crusted port . Mr. Colthurst does not employ an agent , and although he was not present at the eviction which I shall describe , it was doubtless while seated at one of these fires that he signed the order which brought into these mountains his bailiff and the bailiff 's shabby crew of ruffians , and the constables who guarded these against the anger of the people . But let me set forth our experience in a more orderly fashion . It was on a Friday evening , shortly after sunset , that my friend and I left Kilpeder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friend Mr. G , whose tavern lies some three hours ' ride from the town . By doing so , we were able to set forth into the Boggeraghs by early light . To the north , the ground rises steeply to meet the foothills , and , if to a half hour , we were able to pause and look behind us at the town spread out as in a panorama , its shops and churches dark silhouettes in the light of early evening , and , beyond its high walls , the great mass ofp390Ardmor Castle . At the crossroads hamlet , we were made welcome by Mr. G and his good wife , and after our meal , ten or a dozen of hisneighbors came in from their farms to join us . We could watch them coming to us , their lanterns like slow , wandering comets in the blackness . It proved to be a cold , clear morning , so that we could see not only the mountains which lay close at hand , but those stretching into the distance , dark and forbidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : wintry fields as brown as the slopes which lay beyond them , and pasturelands a pale green . A stream , the Navogue , flows between the two hamlets , but this we could not see until we were almost upon the scene . To our either side , the hedgerows were brown and lifeless . North Aghabullogue , our destination , is a cluster of hovels , a dozen of them , and one a bit larger than the others which calls itself shop and tavern . It was eleven in the morning when we arrived , and the people had been long about their tasks . And yet , in truth , there are few tasks to perform now , in midwinter ; but they keep themselves occupied , wall mending , repairing their work carts . So , at least , are most winters spent , perhaps even the present hazardous one . This morning , however , was a special one , and the men had come back from their fields . They stood , some of them , by the closed doors of their cabins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house stood there , nervous as a mountainhare . We had been seen from far off , and our progress studied . The men watched us as we dismounted , but without apprehension , for my friend the schoolmaster had been recognised . " Good morrow , " he called out in Gaelic , and touched his hand to his hat . The man closest to us nodded , grave and unsmiling . My friend , Mr. MacM , walked to the " tavern , " past its stinking heap of dung , rapped upon the door , and entered , with myself following close behind . We were in a dark , low room , with sacks and boxes upon the floor , against the walls . A turf fire was burning , smoky and acrid . Three men were standing beside it , cups of tea in their hands , and to one of these MacM addressed himself in English . " As you can see , Paddy , we arehere on the morning , as I told you we would be . " Paddy was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle age . " It will be a busy day for Aghabullogue , " he said , " more visitors than we have had in many years . " His speech was so thick that an untrained ear might have mistaken it for Gaelic . Of the two others , one , Michael O'Tuoma , was to say , as best I can recall , nothing whatever in the course of the day , and might well have been a mute ; but if so , he was not deaf , for when the conversation was in Gaelic , I noted , he followed intently ,  |p391his  small , deep-set eyes moving from one speaker to the next . But it was the third man , Joseph Haggerty , who was , so to speak , the melancholy occasion of our visit , for he it was upon whom sentence of eviction had been passed by Bartholomew Colthurst . He was a tall , hollow-chested fellow , dark-bearded and with bloodshot eyes . Like the others , he was dressed in the old fashion , with turfcolouredbritches and long wool stockings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you English at all , Joseph ? " I asked him in my halting Gaelic , but he shook his head . And thereafter , we spoke Gaelic only , my own weak efforts being fortified by MacM . Paddy brought mugs of tea to the two of us , strengthened by a copious addition of sugar . Poor Haggerty looked , expressionless , first at one of us , then at the other . " It is a day of sorrow , " MacM said to him , and although heheard the words , indeed nodded towards them , he said nothing , and his gaze was fixed somewhere beyond us . " There are seven of them , " Paddy said , " himself and the woman and the five children . Of the children , the oldest is a girl of nine . " " Merciful God , " I said . " What is to become of them ? Where are they to go ? " " There is room in this house for the two of them this night , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after that ... " He shrugged . " They were a small family . There was but Joe and an older brother . The brother died young , he was delicate . " This last , this reference to delicacy , is how , in English , the country people will often refer to that consumption which is a chief source among them of early mortality . " T is plain what he must do , poor fellow . " They have not even euphemisms for the workhouse , which to them represents , as in fact it is , a plunge downwards through untried air , bewildering and dreadful . It was for the Kilpeder workhouse , then , that Haggerty was destined  --  a broad , low building beyond the town , reeking of misery and misfortune . And worse : for terrible stories attach to it yet from the forties , from the time of the " great hunger . " " Where are they now , " I said to Haggerty in Gaelic , " the children and their mother ? " He answered me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are below , " he said , " at  --  at the cabin . I will go now to them . She thinks that we should take with us the things that we have  --  the stools and the beds and all . But where are we to take them ? " I caught the eye of my friend MacM before he turned awayfrom inc and walked towards the door , and knew that our thoughts werep392the same . It was as though a great ocean separated us from these men and from their world . And yet this would have been the world of our own people a half century ago , our grandparents ' world , a Gaelic world cut off from schools and newspapers and solicitors ' offices . The tavernkeeper , Paddy , stood between Haggerty and myself , an emissary . After Haggerty had left , Paddy took MacM and myself upon a tourof the hamlet . In summer it may perhaps have its cheerful aspects , but now , in midwinter , it lay caught in unmoving cold , the ground frozen , hedges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains , shaking the branches . It was several hours later that a shout from one of the cabins called our attention to the spectacle which we had come to Aghabullogue to witness . Far below us , on the road which we had ourselves traversed , a small procession moved slowly , a cart with men in it , and some eight or ten men on horseback . The riders were in the van , with the cart , a long narrow one , bringing up the rear . From that distance , no sound came to us ; but there was suddenly , briefly , a flash of light , as the sun struck upon a constable 's carbine . A knot of our villagers stood together beside the road , looking down into the valley . I could not read their faces , which were set , expressionless . They had , the most of them , long , sallow faces , and dark , lank hair falling beneath their hats upon their shoulders . MacM and Paddy and myself walked down and stood besidethem . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabins , the women 's arms folded , and shawls drawn close , obscuring their faces . But the men were standing together . Haggerty was not with them . His cabin had been pointed out to me , and now , I saw , he and his family must have gone inside it , for there were none of them about . It was a cabin neither better nor worse than the others , a puddle before it with a skin of ice from which cold sunlight glinted . Presently , the sounds of hooves upon hard earth came to us , and the creaking of cartwheels , but no voices . And shortly after that , we were able to make out faces , including one that I recognised , that of Sergeant of the Kilpeder Barracks , seeming at this distance a toy soldier'sface , eagle nose and fierce moustaches beneath the tall helmet . But neither did voices come to us from the men beside whom we stood . They said nothing . One of them cleared his throat and spat . When the procession reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cart cradled a heavy log , to he used should it he necessary to forcep393an entrance . The bailiff 's crew sat on either side of the cart , their feet upon the log . There were eight of them , and two only could I recognise as Kilpeder men . Eugene B , the bailiff , rode with the sergeant , at the head of the procession , a short , corpulent man , wearing overcoat , muffler , and high-crowned hat . He knew the house which was the object of his mission , as did the sergeant , and they led their men towards it . The men by the roadside turned then and followed them , and now the women , with the children following close behind , left the cabins and came out into the road . " Joseph Haggerty , " B called out , and then called again , the fullname , " Joseph Haggerty . " But there was no response from within , and thereupon , as though he had been expecting none , he took from his pocket the order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked towards the crew in the cart and nodded . At the same time , the sergeant , with a motion of his outstretched arm , sent his constables to spread out in a wide arc that separated the villagers from the cabin . The constables were but performing their duty , without , so far as could be seen , either sympathy or ill will , and yet there was a menace in their very appearance  --  uniformed , caped , helmeted , armed . " Haggerty , " B shouted out again . " This is no good , man . Tisall over . " Then , as though remembering , he called out in Gaelic , a Gaelic more fluent than my own . But from within the house came neither voice nor stir . He walked to the door and beat upon it with his gloved fist , dull echoing thuds . When there was no response , he stepped back , and with a shrug that seemed to be speaking to us rather than to himself , he nodded to his crew . Its foreman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground , and his men clambered down after him . With some difficulty , they contrived to lift out their weapon , a tree trunk which had been stripped clean of bark , and was some eight feet in length . Elsewhere , as we know , efficient battering rams have been perfected , set within frames and swinging from chains . Here we had the homelier and more traditional tree trunk . As they carried it towards the cabin , I became aware of a murmuring about me , to the left and right , men speaking in low tones , either to one another or else voicing curses to the empty air . The crew stood before the door , three of them on either side of their weapon , holding it with anawkward determination . Their foreman looked towards B , as if forsonic final instruction , and B moved his tongue across his dry lips . Aud at that moment , one of the women ran forward , seized up a stone almost the size of her fist , drew hack her arm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she had had little practice or else was distracted by her rage , for the stone sailed well over the foreman 's head , striking the cabin wall , near the door . She was a young woman , and of handsome appearance , as the women of these mountains often are , slender and full-bosomed . Her unbound , black hair fell well below her shoulders , and the force with which she hurled the stone flung it to one side . I saw her in profile , high-cheekboned , and her eye blazing with anger . She had flung the stone , and stood in silence , her closed fists pressing upon hip bones . Others in the crowd now moved to follow her example , stooping down to pick up stones or clods of earth . But Sergeant D movedquickly , swinging one arm towards his men , to draw them close , and with the other pulling at his reins , to swerve his mount towards three villagers who stood together , one of them holding a lethal-looking rock . " Now then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the three , rage working against discretion , rushed forward and seized the reins . I saw him staring into the sergeant 's face with eyes flooded by a frightening anger . At this moment , a small shower of rocks sailed over the heads of the constables , and this time one of them struck the foreman full in his chest , so that he staggered backward but did not fall . Reaching downwardswith a long , sweeping movement , Sergeant D slashed out atthe man holding the reins , striking him full in the face and with such violence that blood sprang from the fellow 's nose in a scarlet spurt which fell upon his coat . The sergeant shouted something out to the man . But now , all unexpectedly , the cabin door was flung open . For a breathless moment , we all stood looking into its darkness , obscure and dim in the winter sunlight . And then Haggerty came rushing out , holding in his two hands a long , murderous-looking pitchfork . Straight towards the bailiff he rushed , the tines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B shouted , " oh God , no , Holy Mother . " But before Haggerty could reach his target , one of the bailiff 's men , quick of wit , threw a heavy shoulder against him , knocking him to the side , and a moment later , one of the constables , leaping from his mount , wrestled him to the ground , and a second one twisted the pitchfork from his grasp . Haggerty began now , most terribly , to bellow  --  loud , meaningless sounds , like a bull calf 's . The bellowing gradually raised itself in pitch , and it was as though he were shouting out words , but with such incoherence that they could not be understood . I was standing close enough to him to see that he was sobbing , the tears flooding his eyes and beginning to run down his earth-dirtied face . His mouth , almost toothless , was a wide , gaping wound.  |p395I  tore my gaze away from him , and looking towards his cabin saw that his wife and two of his children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at her husband with the same helpless wonder that had seized us all ; but the children , for whom it must have seemed an infernal moment , began now to cry . Presently , but slowly , Haggerty 's terrifying sobs died away , and he lay there . The two constables who had grappled with him stood a short distance away . One of the people , a tall , hulking fellow with a set , dark face , came forward now and helped the poor man to his feet . Haggerty looked around at all of us , as though seeing us for the first time . But when he saw his wife , he called out , " Come away out of that , now , Maire . Come over here with me , and take the children with you . " The young woman who had thrown the rock called out to the sergeant , " Let them back into the house , will you , so that they can take what they have . " " For why ? " Haggerty said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus mercy , " she said , " are you all turned to stone ? There are children yet in the house . There are beds that they will need . " And saying this , she strode into the house , passing me so closely that she brushed against my arm . My friend MacM had gone to Haggerty , and had offered himthe flask of whiskey that we had brought with us against the cold . He took it gratefully , and , tilting back his head , drank deeply . Then he wiped hismouth , and thanked MacM . " There is but the one place for us now , " lie said , " and after that , there will be nothing . " A man who had heard him shouted out to the bailiff , " Are you satisfied now , you son of awh- ? " " He is not , " another shouted . " He will have not satisfaction until the thatch is gone and the stones tumbled . " stood stolidly , his face without expression ; but the sergeant , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were less callous , and the sergeant spoke out . " T is the law that is with the bailiff , and you all of you know that . " " A black law it is , " the tall man who had helped Haggerty to his feet said , " and you should be ashamed to serve it . How can he pay his rents , how can any of us ? Look around you , man . That law of yours will clear away all of us before it has run its course . " " T is the law nevertheless , " Sergeant D said , " and the law can not he gainsaid . " " Best get on with it , " B said , and struck his hands together , rubbing them against the chill.  |p396I  can now bear testimony that a family 's dwelling place in the southwest of Ireland can be destroyed in less than an hour  --  the thatch torn off , and the walls pounded in with sledgehammers , pried open with crowbars  --  if a crew of men can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and the two children had come over to him , and now these were joined by their other young ones . They stood together , close but not touching , Haggerty with his hands hanging loose at his sides , and the wife with her shawl drawn so close as almost to conceal her face . By the roadway , those who had gone to the young woman 's assistance had placed , in a jumble , a cheap dresser , a few straw mattresses , some eight or ten shapeless sacks , two black iron pots , a creel , a few three-legged stools . Within the cabin , in their habitual places , they had no doubt composed a life , given the orderliness which the familiar communicates to us . Bits of wood , iron , straw : they had lived in the deep shadows of the cabin 's interior . Now , in cold sunlight , they lay in squalour ; a tinker would not have stooped to steal them . And so too with the cabin itself . In less than an hour , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariable custom , lest the tenant sneak back into it , to warm himself and his family , when bailiffs and sergeants and constables and bailiffs ' ruffians have left . A life can that easily be dashed into fragments . All , after that , was anticlimax . The bailiff 's men , their odious task accomplished , stood in a clump together , uncertain what next to do , but not greatly disturbed , for it was certain now that the villagers intended nothing more , for the moment , than to signal their anger and sorrow with dark looks and shouts . No longer was so much as a stone flung . The young woman herself who had commenced the battery , and who had set herself so bravely against the crew , joined now by a girl of her own age , her sister perhaps or her friend , stood quietly , although her shoulders and bosom heaved . There was on her face a curious expression , as though she could not understand what she had done , her lips parted . Until Mr. B ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constablesremained in place , indifferent or embarrassed , who can say which ; but then they too moved out from the hamlet , and down the narrow road , back to Kilpeder . The people of the hamlet watched them leave , as one might watch a storm from one 's window , heavy shaking branches and scudding cloud . I was standing , my helpless gaze fixed upon poor I laggerty and his family . MacM was beside me ; we could find nothing to say to oneanother . " Now then , " Paddy said , walking over to join us , " we had hestp397take a drop to ease the chill of this . " And we nodded , but Haggerty , when we went to him , would not join us . Neither did he look at us , or at his neighbours , or even at his family . His eyes first would turn , idly , towards the wrecked cabin , and then towards the procession dwindling away from us down the road  --  the crowd of wreckers , and the two files of caped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , " Paddy said . " There are neighbours to watch him . He will come to no harm . " " No , " I said , when we were again within Paddy 's walls , and holding , each of us , his tumbler of whiskey and steaming water against the winter chill . " He will come to no harm at the moment . " The workhouse lies on the far side of Kilpeder , on the Macroom road , a low , broad , graceless building , cut stone fronting upon the county road , but beyond that a higgledy-piggledy of whatever was left of the good stone , and then bits and pieces of fieldstone , rubble , brickwork , and beyond the central block , stretching away towards dull , useless fields , extensions made of brick of which one is an infirmary and one , set up in the years after the great famine of the forties , is the house for women and girls and infants . The windows on the ground floor are barred . Legend has it that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filled to overflowing , the poor and the famished , who had come down into Kilpeder from mountainy villages such as Aghabullogue , suddenly , upon an impulse mindless as a wave , pushed themselves upon the few guards and then trampled over them , and swarmed inside in search of food or of warmth or perhaps of nothing more than something other than bleak grey sky above their heads . But there was nothing within , save peasants as wasted as themselves , hollow-cheeked , but frantic in possession , so that they fought each other , the weak and the starving pummelling each other , cursing , kicking , and flailing out arms . Such stories from the great famine exist everywhere in Ireland , and in West Cork as abundantly as anywhere . Stories of the workhouses in Skibbereen and Schull , where the bodies would be found at the door in the morning , three or four of them , a family perhaps , cold and stiff . Or the stories of the famine graves , and of the cholera sheds at the outskirts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or begging in the streets of cities and market towns . But this is not the worst : there are legends uglier than these , which are not fit to be set down , but which are known , which linger in the air . In truth , the workhouses in these latter days are under the scrupulous examination of conscientious guardians , and the masters and their staffsp398are worthy gentlemen . We have advanced from the days of our parents and grandparents . But nothing can scrub from the imaginations of the country people those formless images of the workhouse as the place of ultimate shame , of the loss almost of name and birthright . It was this to which Joseph Haggerty and his family had been sentenced by BartholomewColthurst , Esquire , of Kilpeder , a gentleman of substance , a member of the Kilpeder Hunt , living upon his rents . The season of the year was Christmas . Aside from MacM and myself , and Paddy , our host , there wereperhaps eight or ten men gathered together by the fire . Most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with word or stone or else had stood in hostile silence . " He is cast forth upon the world , " one of them said in Gaelic , " himself and his people . They are cast forth upon the world . " " As any man among us might be , " another of them said . " It could as easily be yourself or myself as poor Joseph . " Which was indeed the case , for none of the cabins of Aghabullogue had made payment of rents for that quarter , and Haggerty , so far as could be told , had been chosen at random , to make an example . I felt , more so perhaps than my friend MacM , a sense ofseparation from these men , my fellow countrymen , although I had myself grown up upon a farm not fifty miles distant  --  a bit more prosperous , perhaps , and in an English-speaking region . I had grown up knowing Gaelic , which had been the language not of my parents but of their parents , and the language also of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . A language falls away from one with disuse , becoming , when heard again , a rhythm , a wave of familiar sounds , meanings half recognised . When the door opened again , it was to admit Haggerty himself . Beyond his shoulder , I had a glimpse of bare fields and hungry hills . He shut the door quickly , but a body of cold air had entered with him , a brief chill despite the fire 's warmth . Paddy handed him a cup of hot whiskey , which he accepted gratefully , cupping his two hands about it . One of the others said something to him in a rushing tumble of words which I could not understand , and I looked for enlightenment towards MacM , whoshrugged . " There would in the old days have been a bullet for thatblackguard B , " a fellow said , but using a Gaelic word coarser than " blackguard . " " There would not , " a fellow rejoined . " There was not in those days a gun or a rifle between this valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men waiting for him where the road narrows between  |p399the  rocks , and there he would have been cudgelled , a blackthorn to lay open his head like a rotted apple " " Ach , " Paddy said , " the peelers would have had a word or two to say about that . T is not for sport nor for ornament that they carry their murderous carbines . " " What does it matter ? " Haggerty said . " What is done is done . I do not know where to turn , God help me . " Before we left Aghabullogue , MacM and I made an opportunity to take him aside , and press upon him a sum which had been gathered in Kilpeder from some who did not know him but wished him well . He took it with embarrassment , his eyes not quite meeting ours , and it oppressed me to reflect that in months to come , if other misfortune followed , he might deal more easily with charity . When we mounted , there was no one in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farewell . To our right lay the ugly ruins of Haggerty 's cabin , and a few of his possessions , although most of these had already been taken into the other dwellings . The air was still , and touched with that faint , brittle fragrance which is a presage of snow . " What is to become of any of us here , if it comes to that ? " Paddy said to us in English . But I could only shake my head . I had already resolved that I would set down what I had that day witnessed , and would see that it was printed . It might in that way bring some sense of shame , if not of Christian remorse , to Mr. Bartholomew Colthurst , of DunmurrayHouse , Kilpeder , a gentleman of substance . That failing , and I had little hope for an enterprise resting upon Mr. Colthurst 's moral sensibilities , I might at the very least bring to the people of this county , and perhaps a few miles beyond this county , a sense of how things fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of us , in Mayo , resolute farmers , under the inspiration of the celebrated Michael Davitt but animated chiefly by their own fortitude and resolve , have banded together in a Land League . It may be that such an organization will spring up in the defence of those in Munster who till the fields and nurture the herds . This is devoutly to be hoped . But it will be too late to be of much practical help to my friend Paddy and his neighbours in Aghabullogue . A Land League requires organization and meetings and planning . But Mr. Bartholomew Colthurst of DunmurrayHouse has his troops already in possession , his bailiff and his bailiff 's men and his sergeant and his constables with their carbines , and behind them , the elaborate panoply of the law itself , with its writs of ejectment . It is true , of course , that the victory of his which I have here recorded may prove a hollow one . The eviction of Joseph Haggerty from his small holding does not of itself bring one shilling , bring one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted , it must he assumed , on the military principle by which mutinies are quelled , but in Aghabullogue , as we haveseen , none was intended . No moneys are being withheld from him and secretly hoarded ; indeed , the poverty of that valley is painful to behold . In the weeks since I paid my visit there , there have been no more evictions , although there are rumours in the town of Kilpeder that these may be resumed . Joseph Haggerty and his family did enter the Kilpeder workhouse , but for a shorter time than I had feared : well-wishers in the county arranged for their transportation to New York . It is a path which thousands from our county have taken before them , a sea road to a far better existence than their own country can provide for them . On Christmas Eve , in the warmth and security of my own home in Kilpeder , I remembered Aghabullogue , and the tumbled stones of Haggerty'scabin . He is a remembered name in that village , as his children are . But soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made their way to fences , to the walls of other cabins ; what was his dwelling place will he but a low , shapeless mound , with nettles growing upon it . And his name will grow fainter , will drift away on the winter wind , will vanish . It was a clear , cold Christmas in West Cork . At midnight , as we stood gathered by our front window , my family and our friends , we looked out upon a market square bathed in a faint , diffuse moonlight , and arching above all , a black , calm , starless sky . To the north , and the east , invisible , beyond farms and pasturelands , stretched the Boggeraghs , and , within them , sharing the vigil with us , the imperilled homes of Aghabullogue.  |p401Even  now , when I hold a copy of Christmas in the Boggeraghs and read again its final paragraphs , I can recall us standing together at Bob Delaney'swindow  --  Bob and myself , and Mary between us , and , a bit to one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from Dublin , dark , watered silk , and bits of fur at collar and waist . It was exactly the kind of night described in the pamphlet , cold and extraordinarily clear , with a thin powder of snow on the ground . I remember touching my fingers to the window , the glass frigid as the Pole , and I remember that we did indeed , in that room of Christmas warmth , think of Aghabullogucand its tumbled cabin , folded within hungry hills . I low shrill that pamphlet seems now , with its lurid cover , a crude woodcut of burly men smashing in a cabin while , from the roadside , gaunt and pathetic peasants stare at them . In the distance , mountains tall and jagged as the Alps , capped with snow . But for the month of its appear/ance , it was a great sensation . Finneran 's , the printers in Cork City , had three times to run off impressions of it , and it was mentioned in the Cork Examiner and in the Freeman 's Journal . Bob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared upon the cover and the title page . It is still remembered , although long out of print , of course , and you will now hear it mentioned as the first shot fired in the Land War in County Cork . Which was , of course , precisely what Bob had intended . There was , so he told me later , a small pile of the pamphlets stacked neatly upon his desk the morning that Bartholomew Colthurst came storming into his law office , bundled up in a heavy , caped greatcoat of broad plaid , and with a copy of the pamphlet clutched in his gloved hand . It was a bitter January morning , and he brought a blast of cold in with him . " We do not know each other , " he said to Bob . " We have never met . " " I know who you are , Mr. Colthurst , " Bob said . " Then you know that you have printed lies about me , " Colthurst said , brandishing the pamphlet , " and set your name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colthurst ? There are no lies in that . Have a care what use you make of words , or you will find yourself in worse difficulties . That is a serious charge you have made , but I can see that you are upset . " " Upset , is it ? " Colthurst said . " I have a good mind to set the flat of a whip against you . Who the devil do you think you are , that you can safely slate a man in print ? " " First slander , " Bob said , " and then the threat of physical violence . By God , Mr. Colthurst , you are making a busy morning of it . Would you care to wave a pistol at me as well ? " " There is no need for that with the likes of you , " Colthurst said , " a jumped-up counterboy from Tully 's shop . Pistols are for gentlemen . " " Gentlemen like yourself , " Bob said , " who turf out families onto the roads of winter . Marvellous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that you take exception to my celebration of your activities . " And he let his eye fall upon his small stack of Christmas in the Boggeraghs . " It was almost cruel of me , God forgive me , " Bob said to me that night , as he poured for each of us a measure of whiskey , for Vincent and myself , as the three of us sat in that office , with soft lamplight falling upon the desk , and Kilpeder black as anthracite beyond the windows . His hand trembled a bit , with suppressed laughter . " And cruel it was , no doubt , " Vincent said . " l lc is not the worst in the world , poor Bat Colthurst . He is no bigot , and he is a fine lad for a day 's sport . Many is the fine day 's bcagling that I have had with flatp403Colthurst . And now betwixt the two of you and your literary efforts , you have turned him into a raving ogre , a successor to Lord Clanricarde and Lord Leitrim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did his bit , Vincent , " I said . " He collaborated in his infamy . He turfed out the poor Haggertys , and no doubt about that . Bob and I were there to watch it , and a bloody black day 's work it was . " " There he stood , the little shite , " Bob said , " between your own chair t here , Vincent , and Hughie 's , trembling with rage , and rummaging in his ill-stored mind for some savage insult to hurl at me ; but he could think only that I had served my day behind the counter of the shop , that I have been a fetch-and-carry boy for your father . " " In short , you were goading him , " Vincent said . " Bloody little squireens , " Bob said . " Half-mounted gentlemen , howeveryou would call them . The ragtag and bobtail of Cromwell 's crew . We will clear out that scruff to begin with  --  two or three years , that should take  --  and then , at our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absentees and the great estates . " As he said all this and more , he had a polished boot cocked on the open drawer of the great desk that had been brought down from Cork City , and a half smile that mocked his words and yet did not entirely mock them . It was a mood that had settled upon him now that he was Land I , cague agent for the town of Kilpeder , and indeed a voice in the League councils for all of Cork . " If that is your plan , " Vincent said easily to him , " you have hit upon a sturdy skirmisher in Bartholomew Colthurst . He has damned few lands other than those at Aghabullogue , and his back is against the wall . But lic has the friendship of the other landlords , and the kinship of Colthursts Thread from Macroom to the sea . They will not see him bested to satisfy yourself and your Land League pals , much less the scarecrows of Aghabul-logue . " " Or your father , " Bob said , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had let it become well known in Kilpeder that he favoured the Land League , and would assist it in this way and that . From beginning to end , the Tullys never ceased to amaze me . " Or my father , " Vincent said in much the same manner , as though the two of them had lightly , politely , touched foils in a game of fence . " Well now , " Bob said , " let me tell you about Bartholomew Colthiirst . I will read his fortune for you , and t is easily done , for he has little left . " He lifted down his hoot , and sat squarely facing us . From the Waterforddecanter , he poured measures out for the three of us , and addedp404dollops of water . " He may be your beagling companion , Vinnic , and the devil of a fellow in the field or the bedroom or the County Club , but I am the great authority on his future , because his future is not being settled on the hunting field but in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Vincent said , in tones of mock-admiration . " Not even in Aghabullogue itself . " " Not even there , " Bob said . " Ach , I grant you if Colthurst could find some starveling stupid enough to take up Haggerty 's farm , there would be trouble . The people would toss him into a pot and eat collops of him for dinner , served up with nettles . But there will be no one to take up that farm , nor any second one , should he make a second ejectment . That miserable place is the arse end of beyond , and there was nothing sensible he could have done save take a notch in his belt as the people have done . But not him , not the great beagler ; and now , thanks to Hughie 's eloquence , the attention of all Munster is upon those wretched acres . " " It is indeed , " Vincent said , and although he held his glass admiringlyto the yellowish lamplight , it was Bob he was studying . " And I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baronies will allow one of their own kind to fall prey to a crew of agitators . You will excuse my using their term for the Land League . A crew of agitators . " " No excuse is needed . That is precisely what we are . A crew of agitators . But with a difference , as your friends among the gentry will discover . The gentry will make their stand against the League , I have no doubt , and they will have the government and the army and the Royal Irish Constabulary at their back . But they will choose their cases with care . They will not defend the indefensible , and they will not defend the hero of Hughie 's pamphlet . If you fancy any of Bat Colthurst 's beagle hounds , keep your eyes open . He will be selling out soon . " ' Eighty . ' Eighty-one . ' Eighty-two . Those were Bob Delaney 's great years of prophecy . That night , as Vincent and I stood in the square , the two of us  --  myself perhaps as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit annoyed by the way in which he had taken to confronting life , crashing into it full-sail , and with an air of certainty . " He knows what the gentry will do , " Vincent said , slapping his gloved hands together against the cold . " Who in God 's name told him , the Land Leaguers above in Macroom and Cork ? Have you ever seen such a pack  --  solicitors and nisi Arius advocates , out-at-the-elbow journalists ? " " Ah , well , " I said , to keep the peace and to get home out of the cold , for there was a thin , fierce wind coming down from the hills , " t is a new enthusiasm . " But we were quite wrong , the two of us , to he that light and mockingp405about it . In those three years of prophecy , as I came later to call them , I do not believe that Bob took a single false step . It is his public life of which I am speaking , of course . For in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But is it not wonderful to say of someone from Bob 's beginnings , a shop assistant  --  Bat Colthurst had the right of it there  --  that he came to have a public life , to be one of the great men of the Land League , and a member of Parliament , and to be known as one of Parnell 's young lieutenants ? There is such a thing as grasping fortune by the forelock , as the old writers would phrase it . But it is perhaps , rather , that there are momentsthe lives of a few men when they are lifted out of their own obscurity , and welded onto the history of their people , so that the two are one . What I have called Bob 's gift of prophecy in those few years was a sureness in action , a certainty that the great weighted pendulum of history was on the move , sweeping through time and space . A pendulum sharp-edged as an executioner 's ax . Poor Colthurst 's affairs worked themselves out exactly as Bob had predicted . Before six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with his cousins in their castle at Macroom , and from there he went on to London and was seen no more in this county . Once , a year or two later , Vincent encountered him above in Galway at a meet of the Blazers . TheI , and War was by then in full swing from one end of Ireland to the other , and in Galway and Mayo great estates were under siege . Colthurst , so Vincent was to report to me , was like the survivor of an early battle , spiteful and grumpy . " He tried to pick a quarrel with me , " Vincent said , " sitting his borrowed hunter , and worrying the ends of his cigar-stained moustaches , but I would have none of it . And he had frequent recourse to a flask the size almost of a quart bottle , taking long pulls at it when He thought there was no one to observe . Thus are the mighty fallen , a family that has been here from the days of Cromwell at the latest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , as Vincent spoke , could I imagine Colthurst in his London lodgings , an exile , nursing his useless anger . That is how the Land War began in our baronies , with the eviction iii the Boggeraghs and the downfall of Bartholomew Colthurst . It was like a first brief shot fired at the commencement of a skirmish . The LandI , vague , to he sure , made much of it , and in platform speeches in Millstreetand Macroom and elsewhere , it was spoken of as another Salamis or Marathon , and Colthurst as a second but more clownish Herod . Now began the great days of the torchlit meetings and processions throughout most of the west and the south of Ireland , and in such mattersp406Kilpeder was not to be outdone . But there was an early one , a few weeks before the first of ours , in Macroom , and I journeyed down with Bob to attend it . For the week before it , there were placards throughout the baronies , of which I preserved one because of its picturesque diction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Great Tenants ' Right Meetingto Come Off in the Square of Macroom on Sunday Next . " And the notabilities who were " expected to attend " were listed in their copious number , including a squadron of members of Parliament led by " Charles S. Parnell , Esquire , M.P . " All that was , of course , but circus glitter , for Parnell and those other notabilities were holding back for a more strategic appearance ; but the placard did state with truth that in attendance would be the hero of Aghabullogue , the defender of the poor farmers in our hills and valleys , the man in the gap , Robert Delaney , Solicitor . And there was a marvellous peroration : " From the China towers of Pekin to the round towers of Ireland , from the cabins of Connemara to the kraals of Kaffirland , from the wattled homes of the isles of Polynesia to the wigwams of North America the cry is : Down with invaders ! Down with tyrants ! ' Every man to have his own land ! Every man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bob and myself , and sat comfortably in his handsome trap , the sides a glistening black , and soft cushions upon the seat . Bob was wearing the new clothes which had been made for him , under Vincent 's supervision , by Duffy the Cork City tailor  --  a handsome frock coat , black as the trap , and with black silk at the lapels . He was nervous  --  I could tell from the way he handled the reins  --  and before we reached Macroom he had smoked three of the long , pale cigars to which he had recently taken , holding them tightly between his lips . It was evening when we arrived , and we went by arrangement to the Imperial Hotel , where John Stephen Murphy was waiting for us , a solicitorhimself and the great man in Macroom for the Tenants ' Right movement . Like Bob , he was well turned out , in frock coat and glistening white shirtfront with a neckpiece of watered lilac silk held neat by a small pearl stickpin . There were with him five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while outside the square was being made ready . It was a grand meal . Girls were kept to the trot , moving to and fro between kitchen and dining room , carrying great serving platters of ham and sliced chicken , bowls of steaming potatoes in their warm brown jackets , and the tall glasses of porter and lager were kept filled . There was about the meal that same sense of excitement , kept under fierce rein , that I had felt in Bob , and as I can look backward now upon it , I understand its sources as I did not then , although Bob had done his best to enlighten me . To myself , and no doubt to countless others , inp407those early months the Land League seemed a virtuous endeavour , and perhaps helpful to farmers in that woeful year . But never until now did I imagine that it would become the instrument that Parnell and Davitt would make of it , with the help of lads like Bob and John Stephen Murphy of Macroom . It was on this day that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that we moved forward to our tea and our slices of fruit tart , darkness had begun to settle down upon the town ; but there was still light enough to see that a great crowd was gathering in the square . Barrels of pitch had been set alight , and from these some of the men in the crowd were drawing flame for their own pitch-soaked torches . You could hear now and then , above the dull noise of many voices , a sudden shout , unmenacing , jovial , and expectant  --  a man shouting across the square to a friend , perhaps , and then a fellow with perhaps one glass too many taken aboard shouting , " Up Macroom ! " or " Up Cork ! " as though at a hurling match . But the League dignitaries took their time , awaiting the most propitiousmoment , and a bottle was put into circulation on the table . Bob and John Stephen , I observed , took but a tincture and filled their glasses with water , exchanging wry smiles . " To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his glass , and we raised ours . As if upon cue , a brass band in t he square commenced to play . I had heard it warming up , the odd cornet note above the noises of the assembly , and the tentative thud of a drum . But it was ready now , and struck up the Young Ireland song by Thomas Davis , " A Nation Once Again . " " And then I prayed I yet might see , Our fetters burst in twain , And Ireland long a province be , A nation once again . " Beyond in the square and within the dining room , the voices fell . It is curious . The avowed purpose of the League was , for the moment , to relieve the pressures upon farmers large and small in this calamitotisseason , and to bring a halt to evictions . Beyond that , shimmering and diin , lay notions of the overthrow of feudalism and a peasant proprietorship . All this had little to do , seemingly , with political independence , and yet here was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man in Macroom , whatever his politics , knew that the fight for land and the light for nationality were conjoined , twisted together beyond the comprehensionof logic . In the square beyond , the crowd was singing out the words , for allp408of them knew them , and here , at the table , first the man who sat to my right , and then a man across from me , and then all of us were singing it , struggling a moment later to our feet , one by one , and standing with our hands to our sides , as though it were a national anthem , as perhaps it was . " For freedom comes from God 's right hand , And needs a godly train , And righteous men must make our land A nation once again . " At the end , there was a roar from the square , but we stood silent at the table , a bit embarrassed , a bit cynical and a bit sentimental at the same time , the two states being close allies . Of the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am not alone in that ; for in the years to come you would occasionally hear a Macroom man say of Bob , " Did n't I have him spotted from the outset , from the Sunday when he stood with John Stephen Murphy on the platform in my own Macroom , and stepped forward , and gave the word that set the baronies ablaze ? Was n't I as close to him almost as I am this moment to you ? A man making his first speech but as calm as O'Connell on the floor of Parliament ? " But I was not myself that close to him , for although both John Stephen and Bob himself urged me to go up with the dignitaries upon the platform , I declined , and stood on the steps of the hotel , where I was joined by others . John Stephen had the chair of honour , of course , with the parish priest and his curate to his right , and Bob to his left . But the meeting was not opened and neither did it close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in later months , when the League had proved itself ; for the moment , the Church contented itself with a show of benign interest . But I will grant to Father Maguire that he was.benignity personified , a well-fed man of ample girth and jowl , and throughout these proceedings smiling broadly , and once or twice about to break into applause , although histrionically restraining himself  --  a message not wasted upon his parishioners , who like most Irishmen were adept at the reading of intricate clerical pantomime . When John Stephen presented Bob to the assembly , with a flowerinessof diction which proved him the author of the placard , Bob took off his tall hat , placed it carefully upon the chair , and stepped to the centre of the platform . He seemed calmness itself , but before he could speak a word , the band broke into " Clonhrony Wood . " It was a come-all-ye at best , a bit of doggerel to be sung , not played upon instruments of brass ;  |p409but  with time a species of instrumental version had been hammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined in . It was shorter , thank God , than the versions sung out in public houses , and it was rousing enough for such public meetings as this one . " Let all true Irishmen be good , And fight for what they hold . Like all those heroes brave and bold , Who held Clonbrony Wood . " " He was one of them , you know , " the man standing next to me said . " Bob Delaney was one of the men who held Clonbrony Wood in ' sixty-seven . " " So I have heard , " I said . " By Jesus , " the man said , " is n't he the great lad ? Would you take a look at him ? The English may have us down in the dust , with their hands upon our throats , but we are not finished , so long as we have lads like that one . " He breathed heavily , and a whiff which mingled porter and boiled bacon came towards me , a homely odour . Bob waited , motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I recognise the song , " he said . " And I seem to remember that I wandered myself into Clonbrony Wood a few years back for some purpose or other , I disremember what . " He waited for the laughter and cheering which followed upon that . " By God , " porter-and-bacon said to me , " he 's a droll lad , is he not ? And a modest one . " " But I must n't search my memories of that occasion , " Bob said , " whatever it may have been . There 's a couple of lads here this evening who will be marking down all that is said , and off it will go to Dublin Castle . " He nodded towards two caped and helmeted constables , one of them with his pad and paper in hand . There was a muttering now , with an edge of uncertain menace , but Bob held up his hand . " Leave them to.their harmless task , " he said . " There will be no word spoken tonight that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More 's the pity , then , " a fellow shouted up to him . " No , no , " Bob said . " Better the peelers occupy themselves with the copying down of oratory than for them to be at the other tasks which they do this year upon the landlords ' bidding , standing guard whilst ruffians toss the thatch of poor cottagers , or carting off to prison some poor distracted fellow who has raised his arm against the destruction of his home Sul ihhle away , lads , " lic called out to the peelers , who stoodbeet-red beneath their stiff helmets , " scribble away . If I go too fast for  |p410you  , give a shout . " Here was a Bob Delaney I had never seen before ; his first public speech and he took to it like a duck to water , a born demagogue , if that is not too harsh a word to use of a friend . Dimly I remembered the words that he had spoken to our lads in ' sixty-seven , when he turned over the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a confident man from first to last ; at the very end , broken and bitter , he was confident in his despair . But in ' sixty-seven , as we stood together the lot of us on the wasteland beyond Knockmany , his words had had a quiet authority , terse as semaphores . But who can say  --  with a man as skilful with words as Bob was from the first  --  who can say where artifice begins or ends ? " Times change , " Bob said , and , now that he had their attention , he risked speaking more quietly , although his words reached to the farthest men and women . " Times change , and plans and weapons must change with them . In the year ' sixty-seven , men rose up across Munster , and up through Leinster to the hills of Dublin itself . And with what results , we all know . Disaster , and the crashing of all our hopes amidst the laughter and derision of our enemies . Ah no , t is well we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes who were hanged in Manchester . But we have seen how far pikes and rifles and pitchforks can carry us , and how far slogans and banners . We are met in a dark year and a cold season . Already you will hear talk that black ' forty-seven may be upon us again . God forbid that this should be so , and I do not believe that it is so . What I do know , and what every man amongst you knows as well , is that we have another ruined harvest , and that with a few decent exceptions , our overlords and masters  --  the landlords  --  will not take this into account . And we know their methods  --  the method of the crowbar brigade , the method of the tossed cabin and the families upon the road . The method of the farm being placed upon offer to whatever neighbour or blow-in will meet the old rent . And fine effective methods they are  --  the land was taken from us by force , by sword and cannon in days gone by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neighbour against neighbour , by the turning of honest men into land grabbers , protected by the carbines of the Constabulary . " There was a flimsy railing to the platform , and Bob rested his hand lightly upon it , and paused . I could see his eyes moving across faces , as though measuring them . " But they need not be effective , those methods . It may not be pleasant for Munster men to look to Connaught for our instruction , but this once it may profit us to do so . In Connaught  --  in Mayo and inp411Galway  --  the farmers large and small  --  mark that , large and small  --  have banded together , as you know . They are insisting upon a reduction of rents , and in town after town , the landlords have grudgingly backed down . And what is the weapon they have used ? Not the pike or the musket , God save the day  --  " " T is a fit use for a rifle , " someone called out . " T is stronger than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering of satirical applause . The shout had come from somewhere across the square from our hotel , perhaps from the porch of one or another of the two public houses , where knots of men stood together . " To be sure , " Bob said , suiting his response to the laughter and the rippling applause . " There is the kind of observation that Dublin Castle will receive with delight . But the weapon that the Land League can place in our hands is protected by the law . We can act against the landlords , and there is naught that they can do . They can not compel us to pay their rack rents , unless they can evict us . And evictions would ruin them as well as us , unless they can find grabbers . They will act to change the laws , you can depend upon that , but there is time needed . By then , we will have won , and Connaught and Leinster will have won . And that will be a battle only , not the war which the Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Ireland . We will settle for nothing less . " The hills beyond the town were in darkness , but there was still a faint , greenish light in the west , towards Kilpeder . The square , though , was vivid with the guttering barrels and torches ; their lights fell upon shops and market house , upon the square crowded with men , upon the platform . Bob was still speaking , and I half attended his words ; but I was lured away from them by the spectacle . There was movement in the crowd , of course : a man wove his way through it , and walked down the road upon some errand ; another craned his neck to look towards a friend . But it was curiously quiet . Even the bit about the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland , not a novel slogan by any means but usually good for a roar , had not jolted them . They were actually listening to what Bob said , and ever after that I believed that I had found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the knack of seeming to speak to each man there , and yet to be speaking to all of them . It was only at the close , and knowing perhaps that it was expected  --  like the couplet that seals the poem , like the grace notes that are sent to linger in the air  --  that he rose to oratory . He had been speaking of the leadership of the League , with artful references to the local men , moving then to Davitt and Parnell , and Parnell 's helpers iii the Parliament  --
