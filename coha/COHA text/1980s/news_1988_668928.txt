" King of the Olympics , " an unidistinguished syndicated mini-series that chugs along for two nights this week , is remarkable only for its improbable subtitle . Which is : " The Lives and Loves of Avery Brundage . " That ' s right , Avery Brundage-the official conscience of the Olympic Games , the controversial , intransigent head of the International Olympic Committee , who relentlessly endeavored to keep the quadrennial event unsullied by political and commercial taint . Avery Brundage , you say ? Might as well be " The Lives and Loves of Marlin Perkins . " Obviously , this being a mini-series-it airs at 7 p. m . Monday and Tuesday on WPWR-Ch. 50-there is more out there than declarations of purity . In this case , the producers have come up with a surprise revelation : The king of the Olympics was also the prince of the philanderers . Written by William Wood and directed by Lee Philips , it leads off with Brundage ( David Selby ) presiding over an IOC banquet in Switzerland in 1952 , then cuts to Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond named Linnea Dresden ( Renee Soutendijk ) , is about to deliver their second child . Not that he hasn ' t stepped out before . Hearing his confession of unfaithfulness , his long-suffering wife , Elizabeth ( Sybil Maas ) , snaps , " Who is it this time ? " That little piece of tawdriness taken care of , the four-hour production settles down into formulaic biopic fare with a rush of flashbacks . Abandoned by an alcoholic father , Avery is taken in by his kindly Uncle Edward , who one day fortuitously shows him a statue of a discus thrower . Overcoming chronically bad eyesight to become a fine pentathlon and decathlon athlete , he competes in the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm , losing to an American Indian named Jim Thorpe ( who would be stripped of his medals for " commercialism " -a decision Brundage himself would later uphold but which was eventually reversed ) . Establishing a successful construction business in Chicago as well as climbing the Olympic ladder , he lobbies for America ' s entry into the 1936 Games despite Hitler ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads the fight to strip U.S. star Jesse Owens of his medals for his accepting $40 , 000 to run against a racehorse , pushes for the continuation of the ' 72 Games in Munich after the terrorist massacre and shelters his dalliances from the press . Multimillionaire Brundage , who died at 87 in 1975 , had the reputation of being a humorless , pompous , egotistical prig . In the series , the portrait is generally more flattering , although he is shown to be a possible fascist and anti-Semite , as well as a hypocrite with selective ethics . Telling his wife it doesn ' t matter that she ' s too old to bear children , he chooses the Dresden doll to provide him with sons , apparent trophies of his virility . Making a deal with England ' s David Burghley ( Nicholas Hawtrey ) to step down temporarily as IOC president , he refuses to relinquish the position 12 years later . With his square-jawed handsomeness , Selby ( " Falcon Crest " ) hardly resembles Brundage but turns in a comparatively convincing performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rush , particularly Kristoffer Tabori as Avery ' s lush of a brother . And with all the flashbacks and flash- forwards , the moribund direction is choppy and confusing . No time is spent examining Brundage ' s loveless marriage , and there is no mention of such maneuvers as his ousting swimmer Eleanor Holm from the 1936 American team for drinking champagne on the ship to Germany , or his marrying , at 85 , a Teutonic princess 49 years his junior . Neverthless , a precedent obviously has been set-the sports executive as mini-series hero-and other producers are free to carry the torch . " Peter Ueberroth : The Man and the Myth " ? Don ' t bet against it . ' KING OF THE OLYMPICS ' Directed by Lee Philips , written by William Wood , produced by Frank Agrama , Henri Spade and Riccardo Tozzi . With David Selby , Sybil Maas , Renee Soutendijk and Kristoffer Tabori . Airing at 7 p. m . Monday and Tuesday on WPWR- Ch. 50.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
