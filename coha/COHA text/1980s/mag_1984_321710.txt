West European leaders rekindle the fire of unity <P> When the leaders of the ten nations that constitute the European Community gathered last week at the Palais de Fontainebleau outside Paris , they knew that the outcome of their two-day summit might either launch the political and economic revival of Western Europe or set the seal on its decline . For five years , the question of how to deal with Britain 's demand for a cut in its disproportionate contribution to the Community 's common budget had all but paralyzed its ability to act on other pressing matters . Among them : the Community 's chronic funding difficulties , its unfinished task of dismantling the remaining trade and investment barriers to a true common market , and the challenge of narrowing the technological gap between Western Europe on the one hand and Japan and the U.S. on the other . <P> Even more important , perhaps , was the problem of how to rekindle enthusiasm for the post-World War II dream of a united and cohesive Western Europe capable of assuming a superpower 's role in world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European parliamentary elections had sent the leaders an unmistakable message : support for that ideal among many citizens is flagging . Moreover , election gains by splinter parties of the left and right heralded a growing popular discontent with politics as usual . <P> These pressures combined to produce a summit that broke the logjam on Britain 's demands . The compromise that was worked out was a diplomatic sleight of hand that saved face for both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand , who had taken personal charge of the effort to end the deadlock . Said a French spokesman : " There are no victors or vanquished . " While other difficulties still remain , Mitterrand , the host of the summit , who was wrapping up his six-month term as Community president , was confident enough to proclaim : " The way has been cleared for us to go ahead with a whole series of new policies . " <P> In Washington , Reagan Administration officials voiced approval . Historically , the U.S. has supported the Common Market , as long as backing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European competition . Underlying this is the notion that fiscal coordination makes Europe a stronger economic entity and thus a stronger trading partner for American business . A Washington official noted that the Administration is working hard to allay European fears of a U.S. tilt toward Asia . He declared , " By and large , our trade relationship with Europe is the most important one we have . "
