The mayoral candidates seldom discuss it , and then only when pressed . Opponents , who say the plan could cost $100 million or more , are promising a television advertising campaign , but have yet to field one . Supporters , who say such cost estimates are wildly inflated , have financing for little more than a week of radio commercials. // Radio and television news programs rarely mention the charter proposal , which calls for abolishing the Board of Estimate and distributing its powers among an expanded City Council , the mayor and a reconstituted Planning Commission. // // A Quiet Campaign // The campaign has been confined for the last month primarily to debates and forums before civic groups and political clubs , Some radio and television stations have begun broadcasting similar debates , featuring some of the more prominent supporters and opponents of the plan devised by the Charter Revision Commission. // More than two million copies of a voter ' s handbook prepared by the commission will appear in New York newspapers tomorrow. // But the quiet campaign over the charter shares one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusing the other of distortion and oratorical excess . How Much Would It Cost ? Perhaps the most significant example of political hyperbole centers on what the new government would cost . Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn , Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and other opponents have contended repeatedly that the new charter could cost the city $100 million a year , or more. // But when the two Borough Presidents were asked for the details of their estimates , they were unable to identify new costs that approached the large sums they have been citing. // When asked last week to explain Mr. Golden ' s projection that the charter could cost $100 million a year , a spokesman , Pat Smith , offered a long list of several hundred new planners , analysts , secretaries and others that he said would be required in 13 agencies under the proposed charter. // But the list totaled $11 million - far short of the prediction from the Brooklyn Borough President . <> <> We ' re on the Outside ' // Asked early this week to explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of renting offices for the new employees . " And there are agencies we haven ' t costed out yet , " he said. // " We ' re not making claim that we have the absolute knowledge , " Mr. Smith added . " We ' re not on the inside ; we ' re on the outside of this process. " // Mr. Golden then held a news conference Thursday to issue a more complete study , showing that the charter plan would cost the city $36. 7 million a year . Frank Mauro , the charter commission ' s director of research , contended yesterday that the report double-counted some new positions and misconstrued other requirements. // A spokesman for Mr. Ferrer , Clint Roswell , was also asked last week how the Bronx Borough President had concluded that the charter would cost $100 million to $200 million a year . Mr. Roswell cited $87 million in broad new expenses . <> <> Other Estimates Lower // The largest single cost , he said , would be for a new , independent budget office proposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s powerful Office of Management and Budget . The new office would cost at least $30 million , Mr. Roswell said. // But the proposed charter states that the new office be financed at 10 percent of the amount allotted for the mayor ' s budget office . Since the mayor ' s budget office now spends $31 million a year , the new budget office would initially cost about $3. 1 million. // Other estimates , with more complete details , project that the charter ' s requirements would cost considerably less than $100 million a year. // The city ' s Office of Management and Budget estimates the government changes proposed by the commission would cost $25 million to $30 million a year , primarily for an estimated 700 to 800 new city planners , analysts and other workers . <> <> Commission Claims Savings // The charter commission says it would cost $16 million a year to comply with the proposal . The commission also contends that as much as $20 million a year could be saved . One city office , the Bureau of the Secretary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiencies in city contracting and budgeting could save millions of dollars , the commission says . Opponents dispute such potential savings. // The opponents also contend that charter commission members have often made misleading assertions . In a radio debate last week , Mr. Ferrer accused the commission ' s chairman , Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. , of exaggerating the likelihood of court intervention if the charter plan is rejected in the referendum on Nov. 7. // Mr. Schwarz frequently notes that the courts gave the city a deadline of next March to address the ruling last March of the United States Supreme Court , which found the Board of Estimate ' s voting system unconstitutional. // " That bogyman , " Mr. Ferrer said , " is being brought I believe to frighten and mislead the people of this city into an affirmative vote for something that I believe they should soundly defeat. " // Mr. Schwarz said he had been careful to indicate that court intervention was one option should the revised charter be rejected . " It ' s a clear possibility , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other opponents said they believe the courts would extend the city ' s deadline so it could create another charter commission to produce a different plan. // " The question is unanswerable , " said Robert B. McKay , a professor at New York University Law School . " There is the possibilty that a Federal court might intervene and say the city has failed . On the other hand , the court might be reluctant to get into the mess that charter revision has turned out to be. " // Many opponents also said the charter commission had overstepped its authority by advocating the plan and by producing documents , particularly the voter ' s handbook , that the opponents contend are misleading. // Alvin Berk , the chairman of Community Board 14 in Brooklyn and an ardent charter opponent , called the 16-page handbook " a piece of propaganda . " Mr. Berk argued that many speculations by the commission are asserted as fact in the handbook . <> <> Request for Court Order Denied // He noted , for example , that it says new powers proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor ' s powers and represent borough interests at City Hall. " // " That ' s a conclusion of the commission , and it ' s clearly disputable , " Mr. Berk said . " It doesn ' t belong in a voter ' s handbook . " He also said the commission should have included opponents ' views in the handbook. // A request from Mr. Berk and several other civic leaders for a court order halting the handbooks ' distribution was denied Wednesday by Acting Justice Shirley Fingerhood of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. // Gretchen Dykstra , the charter commission ' s director of communications , defended the handbook , saying she thought it accurate and fair . The borough presidents ' proposed new powers " are in fact a check on the mayor ' s own power , " Ms. Dykstra said . <> <> Countercharges From Supporters // Eric Lane , the commission ' s executive director , said state law clearly authorizes the commission to decide the propriety of its publications and publicity campaign. // Proponents of the charter plan also noted statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , opponents say frequently that the commission has mounted a $3 million publicity campaign to get the charter approved. // The commission ' s entire budget for the year is a little more than $3 million , Ms. Dykstra said . The public information effort will cost $465 , 000 , including the cost of publications , of holding dozens of meetings and hearings and of reproducing thousands of documents for the public , she said. // In addition , the opponents ' coalition has contended at two news conferences and in a publicity release that an " overwhelming majority , " or 34 of the city ' s 59 community boards , oppose the charter plan. // But a survey by The New York Times showed these results : 38 community boards had not yet voted on the charter proposal , 15 had voted to oppose it and 3 had voted to endorse parts of the plan . Three boards did not return telephone calls. //
