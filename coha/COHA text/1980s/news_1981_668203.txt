The fire station that was home for Engine Company No. 50 is nestled among well-kept rowhouses in the shadow of the Bunker Hill Monument , and yesterday a warm sun filtered brightly through the early spring buds that sprouted on the trees lining Winthrop street . But the scene , so apparently hopeful and optimistic , belied the gloomy business of the day for the firefighters , whose job it was to close the neat , brick building that has been part of Charlestown for more than 120 years . It is one of three stations - the others are in Brighton and on the Long Island Hospital grounds - that were being shut down yesterday . Inside the Charlestown house , the men - some of them being reassigned , some losing their jobs - were busy packing the station ' s rich history into cartons . Outside , the women , most of them firefighters ' wives , cradled protest placards in one arm and children in the other , and voiced their displeasure . Most cursed Proposition 2 1/2 , and none had kind words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city has been taken out of the hands of the neighborhood people , " said Lois Gallagher , a life-long Charlestown resident whose husband , James , belongs to Company No. 50 but expects to receive his layoff notice soon . " I don ' t know what White thinks he ' s doing , or who he ' s serving , but the neighborhoods are bearing the brunt of this 2 1/2 thing . " " Charlestown used to have five fire stations at one time , " said Betsy Titcomb , whose husband , Dougie , also is a firefighter , " and this one was the last in the neighborhood . The streets are narrow and the houses are old . What happens if there ' s a really big fire someday and the trucks have to come from downtown ? " Farther down Winthrop street is a block of boarded-up rowhouses , one of the last vestiges of blight remaining in the area . Lt. James Teed of Quincy , who acts as an informal station historian , squints and shades his eyes in the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windy day and a fire in that block . Maybe in the dead of winter . If the response wasn ' t right , it would spread into another Chelsea surer than hell . " Later in the morning , the voices of 15 or so preschool children , escorted by three women , cut through the air around the station . They were led into the firehouse and allowed to mount the pumping truck still parked within . A camera carried by one of the children ' s supervisors clicked away as they crowded the steering wheel and swarmed over other parts of the truck . In a corner , a motorcycle officer took off his helmet and let a boy named Matthew try it on . And suddenly the neat , brick building became a hive of giggles and shouts of glee . " They ' re part of a Head Start program , " Teed said . " We let them come in and see the firehouse . They love to jump all over the truck , and sometimes we pick ' em up and let ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the little services we provided for the neighborhood . But after today they ' ll have to go somewhere else . "
