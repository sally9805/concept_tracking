The American stage community cherishes a persistent dream : the creation of an equivalent to Britain 's National Theater or Royal Shakespeare Company . New plays would be mounted and the classics reconsidered in an environment sheltered from the hit-or-extinction extremities of Broadway . Over the decades attempts have been made , with varying degrees of success , the Yale Repertory Theater and Robert Brustein 's American Repertory Theater at Harvard . Last week the newest candidate took center stage . The American National Theater , headed by Peter Sellars , 27 , opened at Washington 's Kennedy Center with a less than wondrous Henry IV , Part I by that " American , " William Shakespeare . Sellars ' rationale for starting with an Elizabethan masterwork rather than , say , a Eugene O'Neill tragedy is to rediscover the plays and grandiloquent production styles that were popular at the dawning of the modern American theater . Indeed , the next show , which he will direct , is The Count of Monte Cristo , a French romantic drama that O'Neill 's father , Actor James , toured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for controversial reworking of revered texts . But his new theater 's premiere , directed by Timothy Mayer , is if anything too faithful and tame . Shakespeare 's play depicts a civil war brought about by a usurper King and the self-serving pretenders to his throne . Some productions emphasize the martial valor of the King 's ablest rival , Hotspur ; others exult in the merriment and dissipation of the Prince of Wales ' favorite companion , Falstaff . The closest that Mayer comes to taking a point of view is to underline the play 's presumption that history is made by men , not social forces : he ends many scenes with one or two figures frozen in silhouette . The acting is mostly serviceable , with three happy exceptions : John Heard as Prince Hal is unmistakably regal even in his giddiest antics ; Bruce McGill rockets with energy as Hotspur ; and John McMartin proves imperiously perfect as King Henry IV but insufficiently charismatic , if cunning , as Falstaff .
