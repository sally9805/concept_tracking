Mac was too hung over to drive , so I 'd operate the car , clutching the wheel while Mac sat beside me waving his big .44 , taking potshots at jackrabbits and road signs and billboards and beer bottles . Trying to wake up in time for his ten o'clock class in brand inspection . I 'm sorry to say that my friend Mac was a little bit gun-happy . Most of his forty acres was in tumbleweed . He fenced in about half an acre with chicken wire and stocked that little pasture with white rabbits . He used it as a target range . Nor what you 'd call sporting , I suppose , but we did eat the rabbits . Sometimes we even went deer hunting with handguns . Mackie with his revolver , and me with a chrome-plated Colt .45 automatic I had liberated from the U.S. Army over in Italy . Surplus government property . On one of our deer hunting expeditions , I was sitting on a log in a big clearing in the woods , thinking about Plato and Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really care whether we got a deer that day or not . It was a couple of days before opening , anyway . The whole procedure was probably illegal as hell , Mac was out in the woods somewhere looking for deer around the clearing . I was sitting on the log , thinking , when I saw a chip of bark fly away from the log all by itself , about a foot from my left hand . Then I heard the blast of Mac 's revolver ? that big old .44 he 'd probably liberated from his father . Then I heard him laugh . " That 's not very funny , Mackie , " I said . " Now , do n't whine and complain , Ed , " he said . " You want to be a real hunter like me , you got ta learn to stay awake . " We never did get a deer with handguns . But that 's when I had my first little doubts about Mackie , and about the cowboy type in general . But I still loved him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip of the Western myth . Anybody said a word to me against cowboys , I 'd jump down his throat with my spurs on . Especially if Mac was standing nearby . Sometimes I 'd try to ride those broncs that he brought in , trying to prove that I could be a cowboy too . Trying to prove it more to myself than to him . I 'd be on this crazy , crackpot horse , going up , down , left , right , and inside out . Hanging on to the saddle horn with both hands . And Mac would sit on the corral fence , throwing beer bottles at us and laughing . Every time I got thrown off , Mac would say , " Now get right back on there , Ed . Quick , quick . Do n't spoil ' im . " It took me a long time to realize I did n't have to do that kind of work . And it took me another thirty years to realize that there 's something wrong at the heart of our most popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have guessed by now that I 'm thinking of criticizing the the West , and especially in the Southwest , are what you might call " cow-burnt . " Almost anywhere and everywhere you go in the American West you find hordes of these ugly , clumsy , stupid , bawling , stinking , fly-covered , shit-smeared , disease-spreading brutes . They are a pest and a plague . They pollute our springs and streams and rivers . They infest our canyons , valleys , meadows , and forests . They graze off the native bluestem and grama and bunch grasses , leaving behind jungles of prickly pear . They trample down the native fortis and shrubs and cactus . They spread the exotic cheat grass , the Russian thistle , and the crested wheat grass . Weeds . Even when the cattle are not physically present , you 'll see the dung and the flies and the mud and the dust and the general destruction . If you do n't see it , you 'll smell it . The whole American West stinks of cattle . Along every flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well , you 'll find acres and acres of what range-management specialists call " sacrifice areas " ? another understatement . These are places denuded of forage , except for some cactus or a little tumbleweed or maybe a few mutilated trees like mesquite , juniper , or hackberry . I 'm not going to bombard you with graphs and statistics , which do n't make much of an impression on intelligent people anyway . Anyone who goes beyond the city limits of almost any Western town can see for himself that the land is overgrazed . There are too many cows and horses and sheep out there . Of course , cattlemen would never publicly confess to overgrazing , any more than Dracula would publicly confess to a fondness for blood . Cattlemen are interested parties . Many of them will not give reliable testimony . Some have too much at stake : their Cadillacs and their airplanes , their ranch resale profits and their capital gains . ( I 'm talking about the corporation ranchers , the land-and-cattle companies , the investment syndicates . ) Others , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public lands with their cows . About 8 percent of the federal land permittees have cattle that consume approximately 45 percent of the forage on the government rangelands . Beef ranchers like to claim that their cows do not compete with deer . Deer are browsers , cows are grazers . That 's true . But when a range is overgrazed , when the grass is gone ( as it often is for seasons at a time ) , then cattle become browsers too , out of necessity . In the Southwest , cattle commonly feed on mesquite , cliff rose , cactus , acacia , or any other shrub or tree they find biodegradable . To that extent , they compete with deer . And they tend to drive out other and better wildlife . Like elk , or bighorn sheep , or pronghorn antelope . the part I like . It 's not too easy to argue that we should do away with cattle ranching . The cowboy myth gets in the way . But I do have some solutions to overgrazing . I 'd begin by reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range managers would go along with it , of course . In their eyes , and in the eyes of the livestock associations they work for , cutting down on the number of cattle is the worst possible solution ? an impossible solution . So they propose all kinds of gimmicks . More cross-fencing . More wells and ponds so that more land can be exploited . These proposals are basically a maneuver by the Forest Service and the BLM to appease their critics without offending their real bosses in the beef industry . I also suggest that we open a hunting season on range cattle . 1 realize that beef cattle will not make very sporting prey at first . Like all domesticated animals ( including most humans ) , beef cattle are slow , stupid , and awkward . But the breed will improve if hunted regularly . And as the number of cattle is reduced , other and far more useful , beautiful , and interesting animals will return to the rangelands and will increase . Suppose , by some miracle of Hollywood or inheritance or good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would I do with it ? First , I 'd get rid of the stinking , filthy cattle . Every single animal . Shoot them all , and stock the place with real animals , real game , real protein : elk , buffalo , pronghorn antelope , bighorn sheep , moose . And some purely decorative animals , like eagles . We need more eagles . And wolves . We need more wolves . Mountain lions and bears . Especially , of course , grizzly bears . Down in the desert , I would stock every water tank , every water hole , every stock pond , with alligators . You may note that I have said little about coyotes or deer . Coyotes seem to be doing all right on their own . They 're smarter than their enemies . I 've never heard of a coyote as dumb as a sheepman . As for deer , especially mule deer , they , too , are surviving ? maybe even thriving , as some game and fish departments claim , though nobody claims there are as many deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West . In any case , compared to elk the deer is a second-rate game animal , nothing but a giant rodent ? a rat with antlers . I 've suggested that the beef industry 's abuse of our Western lands is based on the old mythology of the cowboy as natural nobleman . I 'd like to conelude this diatribe with a few remarks about this most cherished and fanciful of American fairy tales . In truth , the cowboy is only a hired hand . A farm boy in leather britches and a comical hat . A herdsman who gets on a horse to do part of his work . Some ranchers are also cowboys , but many are not . There is a difference . There are many ranchers out there who are big-rime farmers of the public lands ? our property . As such , they do not merit any special consideration or special privileges . There are only about 31,000 ranchers in the whole American West who use the public lands . That 's less than the population of Missoula , Montana . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who strings barbed wire all over the range ; drills wells and bulldozes stock ponds ; drives off elk and antelope and bighorn sheep ; poisons coyotes and prairie dogs ; shoots eagles , bears , and cougars on sight ; supplants the native grasses with tumbleweed , snakeweed , povertyweed , cowshit , anthills , mud , dust , and flies . And then leans back and grins at the TV cameras and talks about how much he loves the American West . Cowboys are also greatly overrated . Consider the nature of their work . Suppose you had to spend most of your working hours sitting on a horse , contemplating the hind end of a cow . How would that affect your imagination ? Think what it does to the relatively simple mind of the average peasant boy , raised amid the bawling of calves and cows in the splatter of mud and the stink of shit . Do cowboys work hard ? Sometimes . But most ranchers do n't work very hard . They have a lot of leisure time for politics and bellyaching . Anytime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the nearest drugstore , sitting around all morning drinking coffee , talking about their tax breaks . Is a cowboy 's work socially useful ' No . As I 've already pointed out , subsidized Western range beef is a trivial item in the national beef economy . If all of our 31,000 Western public land ranchers quit tomorrow , we 'd never miss them . Any public school teacher does harder work , more difficult work , more dangerous work , and far more valuable work than any cowboy or rancher . The same thing applies to registered nurses and nurses ' aides , garbage collectors , and traffic cops . Harder work , tougher work , more necessary work . We need those people in our complicated society . We do not need cowboys or ranchers . We 've carried them on our backs long enough .
