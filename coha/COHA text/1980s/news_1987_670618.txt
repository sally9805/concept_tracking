Few drivers these days may think of mini-vans , Jeeps and pickups as trucks . But millions of consumers - particularly younger , more affluent ones - find such vehicles to be attractive , stylish substitutes for cars. // Trucks have changed as much as customer tastes . Options that were found on luxury cars only a few years ago - such as premium sound systems , power windows and sophisticated climate controls - are commonplace on the new generation of trucks . In 1980 , trucks accounted for one in five light-vehicle sales ; this year one truck will be purchased for every two cars sold. // // Second Chance Against Japan // This shift in consumer taste appears to be presenting General Motors , Ford Motor and Chrysler with a a second chance to reclaim some of the buyers they have lost to Japanese companies . Japanese auto makers have largely managed to hold onto their 25-percent-or-so share of the United States car market , even though the rising value of the yen against the dollar has forced them to raise prices . But the Japanese have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an outpouring of attractive , competitively priced new models from Detroit. // During the first 10 months of this year , the share that Japanese imports held of the light-truck market declined to 17. 3 percent , from 19. 1 percent for all of 1986 , according to Montgomery Securities . And the decline appears to be accelerating . In November , sales of imported Japanese trucks dropped 32 percent from the previous year. // Many of the truck buyers are younger and have grown accustomed to buying imported cars . According to a survey by J. D. Power &; Associates , a market research firm , the median age of buyers of sport utility vehicles ( such as Jeeps ) is 34. 9 , while that of mini-van buyers is 37. 9 . By comparison , the median buyer of many domestic car lines is over 50 . <> <> A Positive Image // Because many younger customers are buying a truck for the first time , the domestic companies do not have to overcome an image of producing shoddy gas guzzlers , as they have had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the foreign car , some emerging evidence suggests they may be persuaded to try a U.S.-made truck , " Maryann N. Keller , an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz &; Birney , wrote recently . " Apparently , domestic trucks never developed a poor reputation for quality and reliability . " Indeed , American trucks enjoy a reputation for power and ruggedness that the Japanese are still trying to acquire. // Most of the growth in light trucks has come from mini-vans , sport utility vehicles and compact pickup trucks , vehicles that most of the domestic industry did not even produce at the beginning of the decade . Now , each has annual sales of more than 500 , 000 . <> <> Many Buyers Are Women // Women in particular , have found mini-vans and sport utilities as useful as the station wagons their mothers drove , but with a more independent image , according to surveys . The Ford Motor Company reports that 51 percent of the buyers of its Aerostar mini-vans are women , compared with 42 percent for cars and 27 percent for full-size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn up at a shopping mall than at some backwoods camp . " Despite the traditional macho image of off-roading and four-wheel drive , more than one-fourth of these owners " are women , J. D. Power reported . " In addition , it appears that many of these compact sport-utility buyers are young married couples in two-income households. " // " When we acquired American Motors , we were surprised by the demographics of Jeep buyers , " said Robert A. Lutz , executive vice president of the Chrysler Corporation . " They were relatively young , with good education and high income , like import buyers . " <> <> Chrysler ' s 44% Mini-Van Share // Chrysler was the pioneer of the mini-van with its car-like , front-wheel-drive Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan models , and it continues to lead the field with a 44 percent share of the mini-van market . The General Motors Corporation , which trails with a 27 percent share , is rushing a front-wheel-drive " all-purpose vehicle " into the market before the end of the decade , and Ford , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce jointly a front-wheel-drive mini-van. // G.M. leads in the compact sport-utility segment with a 29 percent share , although the most famous name , Jeep , now belongs to Chrysler . Ford leads in the compact pickup market , holding a 21 percent share , and this year displaced Toyota , which fell five percentage points , to 17. 3 percent of the market. // Auto industry analysts and executives attribute the falling market share of imports mainly to the lack of competitive Japanese mini-vans , restricted availability of sport utilities and price increases made to compensate for the rising value of the yen . " There ' s no denying that the stronger yen has taken its toll on our truck sales by forcing us to raise prices , " said Robert B. McCurry , a senior vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. <> <> Outpricing Japan // He noted that the lowest-priced Toyota pickup , at $7 , 208 , was $315 more than a comparable Ford Ranger and $613 higher than the base Chevrolet S-10 pickup . Early this year , the base Toyota pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck executives estimate that Japanese truck prices have increased about 15 percent in a period when domestic prices rose 2 to 3 percent. // Unlike Japanese car exports to the United States , light-truck exports have not been much of a political issue , undoubtedly because they are so much smaller . But instead of spurring Japanese companies to concentrate on trucks , trade tensions seem to be having the opposite effect : Some Japanese companies appear willing to let truck sales fall so they can concentrate on marketing cars. // This shift is attributable to the voluntary restraint agreement between Japan and the United States , under which the Japanese Government limits Japanese car exports to this country . ( There is no limit on trucks . ) Because of higher prices and an overall fall in consumer demand , it now seems that several Japanese companies will have trouble selling their share of the 2. 3 million cars that the industry is permitted to export in the year that ends on March 31 . <> <> Fear of Reduced Allocation // The fear is that unless the full amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We ' ll concentrate on car market share and hope to sell our quota allocation , " one official of an importer said. // For these reasons , the Japanese have been raising car prices much more slowly than truck prices. // Indeed , Japanese exporters may have a good reason for increasing truck prices so sharply even though the moves are causing sales to slip : They are making little if any money on each truck sold . The appreciating yen is partly responsible , analysts said , but so is the 25 percent tariff the Japanese must pay on trucks . The tariff on cars is only 4 percent. // " Their margins on trucks have to be terrible , " said David Healy , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . " It ' s quite possible they are unprofitable on trucks. " // The problems for the Japanese companies come at a time when truck sales are growing in numbers and diversity . " We want to move increasingly into the personal-use truck market , " said Robert Lutz of Chrysler . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of light trucks this year are expected to approach five million units , up from two million in 1981 . Car sales this year will total about 10 million , compared with about nine million at the beginning of the decade. //
