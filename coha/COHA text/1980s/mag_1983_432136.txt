SPACE  | The good news is that the beer is very , very cold this morning , " Mission Control radioed to the crew of the space shuttle Challenger . " The bad news is that it is 3,000 miles away . " With that message NASA welcomed the five shuttle astronauts back to Earth ? California , actually ? several hours after flight directors had canceled the scheduled landing at Florida 's Kennedy Space Center last week . That was where the mission began , six days earlier , and that was where NASA hoped it would end , making this seventh shuttle mission the first to complete a truly round trip . But fog and moisture in the Florida air , which can damage Challenger 's fragile insulating tiles , forced a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert . It was the only failure of what Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson , head of the shuttle program , called " nearly a perfect mission . " But it was a major disappointment for NASA officials and the thousands of space fans who rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their " Ride , Sally Ride " T shirts in honor of America 's first female in space . Ride 's father , Dale , waiting at Kennedy with Ride 's mother , said , " We live only a hundred miles from the California runway . We could have stayed home . " At least the landing was flawless . Commander Robert Crippen fired twin braking rockets on orbit 97 , above the Indian Ocean , to start Challenger 's hourlong descent toward a dead-stick landing on the dry lake bed at Edwards . At 78,000 feet , Crippen switched from automatic pilot and assumed manual control for the wide sweeping turn that would bring it in line with the runway . He had just one chance to get it right : the shuttle operates like a glider during its descent , with no engines to power up for a second try . Sniffers : After the perfect touchdown , Crippen radioed , " As I said once before , what a way to come to California . " Once the " sniffer crew , " clad in white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous fumes were leaking from the Challenger , the astronauts emerged , led by Crippen , who had piloted the first shuttle in 1981 . His crew followed : Ride , pilot Frederick Hauck , mis- sion specialist John Fabian and Dr. Norman Thagard . The small crowd of about 125 people at Edwards was well prepared for the landing , waving posters that predicted , " A woman in space today , equality tomorrow , " and declared " Herstory made today by Sally Ride . " For mission specialist Ride , however , a sense of destiny clearly took a back seat to a sense of joy . After the landing she stepped from Challenger wearing a big grin , and her fellow astronauts clearly shared her spirit . Fabian gave her an enthusiastic hug and Thagard patted her behind as all five crew members inspected their craft after its 2.5 million-mile flight . The welcoming ceremony was held via television hookup with the NASA brass in Florida , and although it had the air of a welcome-home party with the guests of honor a continent away , Ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember most about the flight is that it was fun , " she said . " In fact , I 'm sure it was the most fun that I will ever have in my life . " @#  | The only hitch came after the crew had been whisked away to Houston , where they were reunited with their families and took the weekend off before starting three weeks of debriefing by NASA officials . Back on the runway , Challenger had gotten bogged down in the mud ? literally . As technicians began towing the craft , they heard some scraping noises from one of its wheels . When they stopped to investigate , the wheel sank into the mud . Five hours later , after replacing the wheel and covering the mud with plywood , they had Challenger under way again . Said a NASA official , " You can sometimes be too inquisitive . " Jelly Beans : The crew 's 146-hour space odyssey had accomplished more than any previous shuttle mission , not only delivering two satellites but also running experiments and operating the robot arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time . The mission proved that men and women can work together in the confines of a spacecraft and that female astronauts have more to offer NASA than help in complying with affirmative-action directives . Ride helped deploy the two communications satellites and a package of scientific experiments ( which she and Fabian later snared with the remote manipulator arm ) , and ran several experiments on board . She also seemed to add some much-needed leavening to the usual technical banter and cli-@#  | ches about the great view from 185 miles up . She and her coshuttlers let jelly beans , a gift from President Reagan , float in zero-gravity and snared them with agile oral maneuvers . During one lunch , Ride reported that there were " three turkeys and two hams aboard " ( not specifying who was which ) , and after exercising on the treadmill noted that she was " probably one of the few people to run across the Indian Ocean . " Her years of training with the robot arm paid off when Challenger performed an orbital ballet with the West German-built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of the fifth day , Ride and Fabian took their places on the aft flight deck . Fabian sent computer commands to the arm , lifting SPAS up and out of Challenger 's cargo bay and into space . Fabian and Ride then took turns grappling and releasing SPAS , which looked more like a dolly piled with boxes and canisters than spaceage hardware . Even Thagard took a turn , although his sole on-board responsibility had been to watch for signs of space sickness and conduct medical tests on his fellow astronauts . Flight director Tommy Holloway , at Mission Control , speculated that Crippen had taken pity on the underworked Thagard ? no one showed signs of illness ? and Thagard had been trained as a backup on the remote arm . Blast : As Crippen and Hauck moved the shuttle around and ahead of the pallet , they fired Challenger 's jets to see how the blast would affect SPAS . While Challenger moved only slightly , the 15-foot-long satellite went flying . That was merely exciting on this mission ( the astronauts easily recaptured it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be space-walking to help retrieve crippled satellites . After 9 ? hours of maneuvers , Hauck piloted Challenger to a final rendezvous with SPAS and the satellite was stowed in the cargo bay . Radioed Crippen : " We 've been told that some crews in the past have announced , We deliver ' , " referring to hauling satellites into orbit . " Well , for flight seven , we pick up and deliver . " Diverting to Edwards was not a good sign for a program that is supposed to work like a scheduled airliner . The next mission ( box , page 69 ) was scheduled for mid-August but will slide at least eight days so that NASA can get Challenger back to Florida . The change in landing site raised questions about whether the shuttle could stay on a schedule that calls for about 15 flights by 1985 ? especially during Florida 's rainy season , when both launches and landings would be at the mercy of Gulf storms and Atlantic hurricanes . As Abrahamson admits , " We are going to have to learn to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the shuttle should operate as smoothly as an airline ? without diversions to another airport when one is socked in. @# 70 NEWSWEEK/JULY 4 , 1983
