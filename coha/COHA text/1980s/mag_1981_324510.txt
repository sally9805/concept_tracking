Calvo-Sotelo ' s gloomy message <P> Tthe Prime Minister-designate , a tall and dour man , had little cheer to offer his fellow politicians . Spain 's young democracy was entering a perilous new era , he warned . Spaniards were disenchanted and pessimistic , the economic situation was " bitter and hard . " In those gloomy terms , Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo , 54 , last week went before the Cortes to seek approval for a new minority government.His 75-minute speech contained no bold departures , no ringing calls to greatness . Instead , it was a gingerly tiptoe around the thorny issues-divorce , Basque nationalism , party infighting-that had discouraged his predecessor , Adolfo Surez , 48 , and finally led him to resign . At week 's end Calvo-Sotelo lost a first confidence vote but was expected to win on a second try , which Cortes rules allow . <P> It was a prudent but far from memorable beginning for Calvo-Sotelo . A successful engineer-businessman from one of Spain 's most prominent political families - the assassination of an uncle in 1936 helped spark the Spanish Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy . When Suarez suddenly stepped down last month , Calvo-Sotelo inherited the mandate-and with it a ruling party , the Union of the Democratic Center , that is divided on most major political issues . Moreover , even a united U.C.D . could muster only 165 votes in the 350-seat Cortes , eleven short of a majority . To escape governing with a minority , Calvo-Sotelo needed the support of several small regional groups in the Cortes , above all the Basque Nationalist Party . <P> At first the party seemed willing to cooperate . King Juan Carlos had visited the Basque area early this month , and moderate Basques had been outraged at the murder of a nuclear engineer by members of E.T.A. , the Basque separatist organization . Then a fortnight ago , a suspected E.T.A . terrorist named Jos Arregui died in police custody in Madrid . An autopsy showed evidence of torture . The scandal forced the arrests or resignations of several police officials , brought tens of thousands of angry Basques into the streets - and all but ended E.T.A . ' s growing isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nationalist Party informed Calvo-Sotelo , there could be no possibility of open support for the new government . The Basque troubles were further aggravated at week 's end when suspected E.T.A . gunmen kidnaped the consuls of Austria , El Salvador and Uruguay from their homes in Pamplona and Bilbao . <P> Given the tense atmosphere , it was no surprise that Calvo-Sotelo carefully skirted the big issues in his Cortes speech . He pledged that his government would " guarantee the rights of people held in detention , " but gave no indication of what he planned to do about the Arregui case . He spoke of the need for sacrifice and austerity in dealing with Spain 's economic problems , but for the most part merely hinted at possible cutbacks to come .
