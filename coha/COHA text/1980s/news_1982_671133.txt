The program will , in effect , be a sequel to " The Uncounted Enemy : A Vietnam Deception , " which appeared on CBS-TV last January . It will probably be shown in mid-September as an hourlong panel discussion during prime time , according to a CBS News official who asked not to be identified. // Planning for the program has been complicated by several factors , including the possibility of a $300 million lawsuit against CBS by Gen. William C. Westmoreland , who was said in the original documentary to have led a conspiracy to underestimate deliberately to his superiors the size of enemy forces during the Vietnam conflict. // Four months after the original documentary , TV Guide magazine charged that the program had violated CBS standards of accuracy and fairness . Following a six-week investigation into the charges , the president of CBS News , Van Gordon Sauter , issued an eight-page memorandum last month based on a 68-page report . In the memorandum Mr. Sauter stood by the documentary , although he acknowledged that CBS News had committed five violations of its journalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring the issues raised in the documentary . <> <> Westmoreland ' s Terms // At least three of the proposed participants in the program have said they are mistrustful of CBS and so far have declined to commit themselves to be on the program unless certain conditions are met . Principal among these is General Westmoreland , who has written a letter to CBS specifying the terms under which he could appear on the follow-up broadcast . The general , who was traveling in Japan yesterday and thus was unavailable for comment , has hired Dan M. Burt , a lawyer , to advise him on matters related to his treatment in the CBS documentary. // Mr. Burt declined to discuss any possible litigation . But he said in an interview : " General Westmoreland was accused of what many feel was treason . I think the general would not make an idle threat and would say nothing he did not intend to do. " // Neither Mr. Sauter nor Mr. Burt would disclose the contents of General Westmoreland ' s letter to CBS , nor would Mr. Sauter comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A source close to the general said that his letter was sent within the last two weeks , that it contained a deadline for the program ' s appearance , that it made suggestions about the program ' s format , and that it requested access to CBS ' s report on the investigation into the documentary . Mr. Sauter has declined to make the report public on the ground that it is " an internal document not written for public release . " <> <> Unedited Broadcast // CBS officials declined to discuss the specific format of the follow-up program , but several of the proposed participants said it would be taped in New York during the week after Labor Day and would be broadcast unedited. // They said it would feature a panel discussion with representatives of General Westmoreland ' s point of view as well as advocates supporting charges made in the documentary - probably Sam Adams , who had been CBS ' s paid consultant for the documentary , and Col. Gains Hawkins , an expert on the Vietcong during the Vietnam War . Both Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , three journalists , probably from outside CBS , will ask questions of the panelists. // One of the journalists who has agreed to participate is Peter Braestrup , formerly a reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post who covered the war in Vietnam . He said that when he discussed the program last week with its producer , George Allison , " they were still scrambling to get a quorum - I have a feeling they are having a great deal of difficulty with this. " // Mr. Braestrup , who wrote an article in The Washington Journalism Review raising questions about the CBS documentary , said he had urged Mr. Allison to " get a full cast of characters - all the people who should have been on the documentary in the first place . " <> <> Some Reservations // Two proposed participants in the follow-up program who were not included in the original documentary have expressed reservations about appearing on the program . One of them , Gen. Phillip Davidson , formerly the military ' s chief intelligence officer in Vietnam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length originally proposed by CBS - was too short a time in which to examine the issues , and he suggested the program be expanded to an hour. // Moreoever , General Davidson said , " there are obvious legal implications , how this program might affect things if General Westmoreland sues CBS . " General Davidson said that last Wednesday he asked Mr. Allison for a detailed description of the format and its participants , and that Mr. Allison agreed to do so in a telegram. // " I would like to do the program , " General Davidson said . " I would like to clarify this thing , but I would want to have very careful answers to the questions I asked . I don ' t think the situation indicates anything but a great deal of wariness. " // The other person to express reservations was George Carver , who was the Central Intelligence Agency official in charge of Vietnamese affairs during the period examined by the documentary . He said Mr. Allison told him the program was being presented because " there had been charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of sufficient importance to take a more balanced look at it. " // Mr. Carver said that he was told that " the object of the exercise was not an adversary situation with the prosecution speaking and then the defense , but to get the facts out . " He said , however , that " I was disconcerted when I heard Sam Adams would be on - Sam has had his innings. " // Mr. Carver told CBS that " I was terribly concerned about being a hostage to the cutting-room floor - I said I didn ' t trust his network . " Although Mr. Carver said he was relieved to hear that the follow-up program would be presented " live on tape " without any editing , he got CBS to agree to the presence of his assistant to tape his remarks. // Mr. Carver said he had agreed in principal to participate " provided I know the ground rules and who is going to be on . " He added : " I am going to insist on getting something in writing before I go on. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
