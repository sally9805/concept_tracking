Seven G. O.P. debaters circle warily and draw no blood <P> " It 's like the Romans at the Colosseum waiting to see which gladiator survives , " cracked Gerald Carmen , Ronald Reagan 's campaign manager in New Hampshire . Carmen and assistants to Reagan 's rivals were huddled in a small room beneath the stage where seven G.O.P. hopefuls were debating last week in a Manchester high school auditorium . As the candidates spoke , the nervous aides winced , grimaced , paled and finally relaxed . All the gladiators survived , and none was bloodied . The League of Women Voters ' first 1980 presidential forum was considered pretty much of a draw . No candidate particularly shone ; none faded away . <P> A draw , however , was not good enough for Reagan , who had skipped the first G.O.P. debate in Iowa because he thought that as the front runner , he should not present a target to his opponents . After coming in second in Iowa 's caucuses , Reagan decided to get into the arena with his adversaries . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halting start in Manchester . He made his points , but pallidly . Because of an unlucky draw , he was the last of the candidates to speak , following John Anderson , John Connally , Philip Crane , George Bush , Howard Baker and Robert Dole . " I kept hearing my own answers coming back , " he said . But he adroitly fielded an unwelcome question from the audience about why he had told an ethnic joke a few days earlier . Claiming that he had been on the right side " long before there was anything called civil rights , " Reagan said that he was doublecrossed by a reporter . Said the candidate : " I was stiffed . " But he assured the audience that he does not like telling ethnic jokes . He added : " From now on , I 'm going to look over both shoulders , and then I 'm only going to tell stories about Irishmen , because I 'm Irish . " <P> To keep up the politics of joy he displays on the campaign trail , Bush tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Afraid of making a mistake that " might blow our momentum , " he said as little as possible . Even so , he came close to one of those dread bloopers when he described Social Security , a sacrosanct subject if there ever was one , as " largely a welfare program . " But then he hastily made clear that he was really talking only about supplementary benefits like Medicare-not Social Security pensions . <P> Aside from Odd Man Out Anderson , who once again called for a 50-per-gal. tax on gasoline to cut consumption and chided his rivals for failing to take specific stands , the candidates mostly agreed on the issues . Some of them differed over whether personal income taxes should be indexed to keep Americans from being pushed into higher brackets by inflation and whether the Constitution should be amended to require a balanced federal budget .
