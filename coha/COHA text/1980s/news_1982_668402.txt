In the control room of Studio A , WGBH-TV Boston , seven television monitors glow with a fairly realistic backyard scene . From speakers comes an indistinct voice which gets clearer as a figure paces into the seven screens with head bowed . He strolls contemplatively around a chair , then off , his voice a heavily amplified mutter . " He was the odd one , the bookish one . . . " You recognize the voice before the man . It is the de Tocqueville of the TV Age , Alistair Cooke , busy rehearsing his prefatory pearls of wisdom for one more " Masterpiece Theatre " miniseries , this time the Twentieth Century Fox-British Broadcasting Corp . production of D.H . Lawrence ' s " Sons and Lovers . " This is Alistair Cooke , the armchair historian and once-a-week literary critic whose distinguished face and terribly urbane eloquence have defined one of PBS ' premier programs every Sunday evening for 12 years , and who last night introduced the new season ' s inaugural , " To Serve Them All My Days . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire pageant of American history in 13 segments , which won four Emmys , a Peabody Award , and the Benjamin Franklin Award of the Royal Society of Arts . This is the man who is a different kind of household word in England : the alert journalist whom Le Monde has called the best journalist in the world , who has has been on the American scene for 45 years , writing about the United States in the Guardian and the London Times and broadcasting about the country over the BBC to more than 60 countries on all continents but North America . This is a one-man public relations company representing England to America and America to England who , in 1973 , Queen Elizabeth II made an honorary Knight Commander of the British Empire for " his outstanding contribution over many years to Anglo-American mutual understanding . " The title was honorarybecause Cooke has been an American citizen since 1941 . This is an expatriate , booster , and wag ; golfer , gentleman , and jazz pianist . This is Alistair Cooke , whose name fits him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s taping. - " OK , let ' s go , " says Ken Corcoran , the director . Cooke , sitting in the middle of what is supposed to be a bleak , primitive coal miner ' s backyard , looks inappropriately dapper . He mutters lines as he squints at the lights , rubs his eyes , brushes his hair . Corcoran directs : " One minute to curtain . Jim , Camera 1 , move on out wide . He ' ll be reading to Camera 1 only . . . " The typical Hollywood slate is held over Cooke ' s face , which looks a little dour now . " Say a few words for us , Alistair . " Cooke clears his throat . " Good evening . I ' m Alistair Cooke . " " Great . OK , Camera 1 , start a slow move . Good . . . good . . . OK , cue Alistair . " In his familiar , cultured accent , Cooke begins his introductory remarks but breaks off after a technical mistake . He jokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mickey Spillane . . . " Take 2 goes perfectly . He talks in superbly modulated sentences that sound like conversation rather than memorized lines . Cooke is teacher and friend . Unlike other TV intellectuals such as William F. Buckley , Cooke never appears snobby or priggish ; there ' s something in him of the eternal gentleman , even of the courtier , and modesty goes with that . He breathes in all the right places , and the whole thing sounds as if it could be said in no other way . The director is excited : " Hold . . . OK , that was nice . One take . " He turns . " To do that in one take is amazing . That shows what a consummate professional he is . " Beyond the set door , Cooke is already at his lamp-lit desk . He will memorize five intros before lunch , deliver them all in one take . " He ' s the best in the business , " Joan Wilson , the executive director , enthuses . " No one just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does them so effortlessly . " - Sitting athletically at the desk just offstage waiting for lunch to be brought , the 74-year-old Cooke immediately begins holding forth with a cigarette in his hand . This may be the quintessential Cooke : Cooke the talker . He tells stories , traces history , delivers one-liners , gives opinions , and is , in sum , brilliant and utterly charming . One finds him much more lively , friendly , and , yes , more American than one would imagine him from his " Masterpiece Theatre " bearing . Sitting there in his infinitely civilized tweed and slacks , he ' s full of rakish humor and comments that belie the suave detachment that epitomizes the TV image . The easy yet formidable intelligence still shines , but there is more sparkle , more edge and energy . As he vigorously sucks chocolate milk from a straw , there is a sense of mental speed , and of fun . - Los Angeles : " I ' m told it ' s where the action is , but I have no interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Football ' s attractions are as much a mystery , and about as thrilling to me , as Zen Buddhism , whereas golf is the joy of life . " - McDonald ' s : " The public burger is a terrible thing . It ' s one of America ' s great scandals . " - Miss America : " One thing that always strikes me about her is that she is vastly inferior to any one of the 2000 girls who advertise lipstick in this country . " - " E.T . " : " I ' m suspicious of E.T. , for he is a desperate throwback to the days before technology . His adorable little face promises hard times for America . " Such crisp and casual wit enlivens everything Cooke does , for his 40 years of inspired chat about this country have been wholly devoid of the fish-eyed solemnity of the sociologist . Though he worries about America , he refuses to see the country as one big crass tragedy . As he says in " Talk about America , " a 1968 collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the darkest days , cheerfulness kept breaking in . " Few social observers have remained so good-natured while picking through the heap of paradoxes that is America . Though he can be wickedly critical , Cooke remains America ' s ardent admirer . He is not the bemused English Observer of the American Scene , in America but not of it , driving a Chevy around the country but remaining forever an Englishman . No , Cooke is never so uninvolved . Instead , one gets the idea that he has carried on a passionate love affair with America from the moment he hit these shores in 1937 with an immigrant visa in his pocket . " I knew this country was for me , " he says simply . " I had no doubts . " Though he first sighted America in 1932 , a 23-year-old honors literature graduate of Cambridge University on a two-year fellowship to the Yale School of Drama , Cooke ' s mind had always buzzed with thoughts of America . When he was a child during World War I his family billeted American soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head roared with images of " licentious movie stars , ruthless gangsters , a boastful citizenry , and a government called Uncle Shylock ' " which mingled with the heroics of Lindbergh , the grace of Fred Astaire , and the joys of American jazz . After Yale tried to teach him " how to spell Sophocles , ' " Cooke moved to Boston and Harvard for his second fellowship year . Required by the terms of his fellowship to buy a car and drive around the country during the summer , Cooke lit out like many Americans before him , crashing in cheap autocourts en route to Yosemite , the Grand Tetons and the Petrified Forest . " The people , the sights , the energy , they were definitely much more interesting to me then drama and academics , " Cooke says . " I got real excited by this country . " He chuckles . " In fact , I was off my head . Just thrilled . " He returned to England in 1934 to become the BBC film critic , but the bug had bitten ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to America for good . By 1937 , with the United States emerging as the greatest power in the world , Cooke says " what I ' d seen made me realize that the whole country had never really been written about . " He came , and began filling the gap , first as a second string foreign correspondent for the London Times , then for 24 years as the chief American correspondent of the Guardian . His weekly BBC radio broadcast , " Letter from America , " has been running longer than any other program in history . " In the early days I was 200 percent American , as often happens , " Cooke says with a chuckle . " Now I ' m an Englishman visiting in America , and an American when I ' m in London . " He pauses . " No , I almost always feel like an American . " But what makes one an American ? It ' s an impossible question , the wrong question , and Cooke loves America too much to answer it . He refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his articles where he tells about declining a newspaper assignment because the editor ' s request came in the form of a cable reading " WOULD APPRECIATE ARTICLE ON TEXAS AS BACKGROUNDER JOHNSON STOP COWBOYS COMMA OIL COMMA MILLIONAIRES COMMA HUGE RANCHES GENERAL CRASSNESS BAD MANNERS ETC . " Now , asked how he defines the spirit of his adopted country , he objects abruptly to the idea of any national character , with its suggestion of generalization . " People , nations , they ' re all the same , and they ' re all part of something called human nature , not any national nature , " he says . " So I take things in themselves . It is the oddities and contradictions and strange little details that interest me . I don ' t try to relate everything to any one idea of what America is . That seems terribly presumptuous , and a way out . Things are never so simple or boring as that . " " As a journalist , then , your job is to explode preconceptions , sometimes to confirm them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One understands why , when he says he worries about America these days , it is a question of false images that concerns him , and why he illustrates his concerns with simple but surprising facts . " How can I put it neatly ? " he wonders , thinking hard , pausing for a long time and lighting a cigarette . " I would say the most dangerous threat to America comes from , let ' s say , believing in its old reputation as a unique and uniquely powerful nation . It happens to all great nations . They go on maintaining as a fiction what once was a fact . In Edinburgh you will meet Scottish doctors who will talk about Edinburgh as a center of world medicine , and in Vienna people try to talk about Gay Vienna ' when it ' s one of the most melancholy towns in the world . Nothing is sadder than keeping up the pretense . People still say America has superior know-how , but in fact we make every second-rate thing there is . We assume that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , they buy German . The Italians killed us on shoes . " " This is what concerns me so much about Reagan . All this going on about True Grit ' and John Wayne ; I mean , cowboys were scoundrels , first-class land thieves , but we ' ve made a fetish of that kind of heroism anyway . Obviously , such posing is extremely dangerous at this time . " Such serious criticism comes as a surprise from one who has been both accused and praised as " a booster " and apologist for America , from one whose prose seems so unrelentingly buoyant . " I guess I ' m a short-term optimist and a long-term pessimist , " Cooke says , " In the short run I love life , can ' t imagine being bored , have an absurd number of interests , way too many : I wish I was a surgeon , I wish I was a meteorologist , I wish I was a jazzman . But in the long run , I don ' t really see this country as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , then sits back : " It ' s the nuclear thing , of course , " he says , shuddering . " I just don ' t see how we can get out of this mess . " In the meantime , Cooke appears undaunted . He travels between San Francisco , Vermont , and London , the cities where the four sons and daughters and nine grandchildren of two marriages reside , " eating , drinking , and seeing my friends , " stopping at his own apartment in New York to " get the laundry done . " He is putting together a collection of occasional pieces called , " The Patient Takes the Floor , " a book made up of his addresses to professional organizations . " Do you like the title ? " he asks . " My English publishers like it very much , though the American ' s don ' t : It ' s not snappy enough for America . " Asked if the book tries to make any point about America during this worrisome time , Cooke recoils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just comes out the way it comes out . Humans are humans .
