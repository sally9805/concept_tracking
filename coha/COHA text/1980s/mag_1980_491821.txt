In 1912 , disgusted with the job William Howard Taft had done as President , Theodore Roosevelt formed the " Bull Moose " Party , ran as a third-party candidate , split the Republican vote and helped put Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the White House . In 1948 , Henry Wallace began a third-party movement . So , too , did Strom Thurmond of South Carolina , Twenty years later , George Wallace , running as the American Independent Party candidate , gained more than 13 percent of the presidential popular vote . Eugene McCarthy , also leading a third party , gained considerably less when he ran . The fortunes of these candidates have varied widely ; John Anderson or anyone else who decides to start an independent movement in 1980 may discover what other third-party nominees have found  --  in America , unlike those countries which prefer a multiplicity of parties , people cherish the two-party system . And likely will continue doing so . Why , then , do fringe parties retain hope in their future despite the prospect of so little success ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The power is elusive . It 's been 124 years since any new party  --  the Republicans , as it happens  --  got enough of a start to make a genuine bid for the presidency . ( The Republicans finished second to the Democrats by about 536,000 votes in 1856 , and then won the White House in the next six presidential elections . ) But the Republicans got started at a unique time in American political history  --  at a time when the other two major parties were nearing disintegration . The Whigs did , in fact , disappear in 1856 . The Democrats were in so chaotic a state that  --  for the only time in American history  --  a challenger defeated an incumbent president of his own party in the race for his party 's presidential nomination , and then went on to win the presidency in the ensuing general election . In fact , the Democrats were not able to pull themselves together enough to win a presidential election for the next 28 years . The likelihood that this situation will be duplicated  --  that both major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus open the path to power for a fringe party  --  is very slim . The fame is equally elusive . Fame does not necessarily transfer from the party to the candidate : In one recent presidential election , Hennings Blomen , E. Harold Munn , Sr. , and Fred Halstead were all presidential candidates for well-entrenched and long-existing fringe parties ( one was organized in 1869 ) , and yet they came away with not much more fame than they had before the election . Nor does fame seem to transfer from the candidate to the party : Senator McCarthy , Eldridge Cleaver and comedians Dick Gregory and Pat Paulsen were all candidates in the same recent presidential election , and yet most people can not remember  --  or believe  --  the parties they represented . The hard fact is that fame does n't much matter in any fringe-party effort : The Bull Moose party had Teddy Roosevelt as its presidential candidate , the Progressives had Senator Robert M. LaFollette , Sr. , the Socialists had Eugene V. Debs and Norman Thomas , the States Rights party had Thurmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of them ever did much more than become a " spoiler " ? if they even achieved that . And some of the most successful of the " spoilers " never lasted long enough to turn up in another election . But there is one more compelling dimension to fringe-party activity that suggests why so many of them try to buck the odds : the chance to influence history . That is a real and continuing prospect , if only because history tells us that so many of the fringe-party positions of the past have become public policy ? usually after the major parties in power reject and condemn them for a few decades . Almost all the reform and welfare legislation of the last century  --  from child labor laws to Social Security to regulation of public utilities to consumer protection ( such as the Pure Food &; Drug laws ) ? had their origin in fringe-party proposals . Today the trend continues : The demand that a Constitutional amendment be passed to bar a deficit in the federal budget came out of a proposal made by the Libertarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has only since been picked up by the Libertarians ' rival in that election , Jerry Brown of the Democrats , for his presidential campaign . It is that particular imperative that made a current political dynamic the most talked-about , closely examined and bitterly fought-over political movement of these times . It is called the " neo-conservative move-ment , " and it is notable because it has no candidate , no party , no fund raisers , no vote-getting apparatus and  --  as far as the most searching observer can see  --  only one individual who could qualify as a professional politician . And yet it already has influence that far outstrips that possessed by the U.S. Labor party or the Libertarians or any of the other fringe parties . Why ? Because the ideas and positions of the neo-conservatives strike a sympathetic chord in a large portion of the electorate  --  in that portion of the electorate that reacts less to labels than to the actual position being stated . Take labels : The neo-conservatives are not conserva-tive . And never have been . Quite the contrary : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them still like to call themselves " liberals " ? ev-erybody likes to think of himself as a " true liberal , " even the flintiest of old-line conservatives . But the neo-conservatives have positions outside the two extremes of political thought  --  some-where between them  --  and thus have the pleasure of being detested by both liberals and conservatives . For example : The neoconservatives would not , as " pure " conservatives still demand , undo all the social and economic programs instituted by the nation since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt ? unemployment compensation , Social Security , job programs for the unemployed , legal protection for organized labor and many , many other actions . Nor would they , as many liberals demand , extend this trend indefinitely until the government controls most or all of our lives . Indeed , they tend to express a skepticism about massive new welfare programs ; they feel the civil-rights movement entered a self-destructive phase in turning to riots and violence  --  and to separatism  --  in the late 1960s ; they deplore the **27;4174;TOOLONG zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they do not clamor for the collapse of the corporate structure of the American economy . Most important , they are militantly against communism and the expansionist policies of the Soviet Union . Even in the days when they thought of themselves as liberals and socialists , most of them were anticommunist and anti-Soviet . This gave them a certain distinction  --  as compared with many of their associates in left-wing movements  --  and today it is still setting them apart , though from Democrats and Republicans . Their need to stand apart from the orthodox political lines  --  or between them  --  derives from the contradictions within both parties . The Republicans " talk " a great war against the Soviets , but the neo-conservatives have perceived that it was a Republican , Richard M. Nixon , who negotiated and signed the SALT I treaty , who got it through the Senate and who celebrated his policy of detente  --  all of which did not help our military posture vis-a-vis the Soviets : Nixon , critics charge , gave the communists the time and opportunity to build their weaponry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " talk " a great peace , but once in power they make it clear that they will go to war if the communists pursue an expansionist policy that damages the best interests of the U.S. or its friends  --  consider what happened in Greece , in Persia , in Korea , in Vietnam and now in the Persian Gulf . So if you 're a neo-conservative , what do you do ? Do you support the Republicans for what they say or the Democrats for what they do ? Most people would give up on both . They 'd vote for a fringe party or try to form their own . Because neither approach has worked , neoconservatives chose another course . They recognized that they were not politicians ; they are thinkers , writers , critics , teachers , editors . So instead of plunging into political organization , they took to writing and speaking about the emerging neo-conservative point of view . It was a sound decision . For in time they found that their opinions got greater circulation and respect than if they were merely politicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open political activity . For the in-fighting among intellectuals is as rancorous and searing as among politicians  --  often more so . It was lonely as well as bitter . For the neo-conservatives gradually found they were estranging themselves from their long-time friends on the left without ever quite being accepted by their long-time enemies on the right . Consider the experience of Irving Kristol , an editor , journalist and professor who is considered by many to be the " father " of the neo-conservative movement . Ever since he was in college ( in the late 1930s ) , he took positions that seemed inconsistent to both the Right and the Left : He was a dedicated socialist  --  a Trotskyite for a time  --  who hated Soviet communism and spoke out strongly in favor of the total dimension of life in America . Significantly , it was the Left that , over the years , came to make the most abrasive assaults on Kristol while the Right left him , rather triumphantly , undefended  --  even to the point that the attacks of the Left hurt the Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1952 , when Senator Joe McCarthy and his bizarre anticommunist tactics were at their apogee  --  and McCarthy 's liberal adversaries were at their most livid  --  Kristol wrote , despite his leftist past , " There is one thing the American people know about Senator McCarthy ; he , like them , is unequivocally anticommunist . About the spokesmen for American liberalism , they feel no such thing . " That made him as popular in the left-leaning community as cyanide on the rocks . Leaders on the left fell on Kristol with glad little cries and big bared fangs and sought to savage him in a way that would leave him feeling that he 'd have to die to get better . The Right did not quite seem to notice . It was a time when many anti-McCarthy people felt that they 'd rather  --  or they 'd better  --  get out of the country and work abroad . Kristol was one of the few pro-McCarthy people who decided to leave the country for a while . In 1953 , he left the U.S. to take a job as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of Encounter , an intellectual journal coming out in London . Encounter took a strongly pro-American and anti-Soviet stance and , under Kristol 's direction , tried to demonstrate that there was a flourishing body of intellectuals who regarded the United States considerably more warmly than the Soviet Union . That did not sit well with some of his onetime associates on the socialist left ; the superiority of the Soviet Union in all its works and all its pumps is an article of faith in some quarters . At the same time , the Right did not do much to help him ; indeed , it seemed to some that it did what it could to hurt whenever it was n't trying strenuously to ignore the whole thing . Some years after Kristol left the magazine , it was revealed that the CIA  --  through certain devious routes  --  had helped finance the magazine . Then one ex-CIA agent " helped " things along by asserting that the editor of the magazine  --  never quite named by him  --  was really a CIA agent . Naturally , the suspi- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood that an English poet of a certain renown would be accused of being a CIA agent . ) Kristol denied any knowledge of the CIA 's involvement , but he found that the Left was anxious to demonstrate that it had picked up the techniques it deplored in the McCarthy era : guilt by association and the accusation that becomes a fact . A good many leftists would never  --  but never ! ? accept the word of a CIA agent on anything so demonstrable as whether the sun was shining . But on this , they took this ex-agent 's word in a way that confirmed , to them , the guilt of Irving Kristol . Again the Right raised no voice in defense either of Kristol or the principle of the Right that was under assault from the Left . For the Left was eager to establish that Kristol 's " Americanism " had been bought and paid for by the CIA . And to use this as " proof " that any expression of " Americanism " was bought and paid for . The utter virulence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the neo-conservatives is reflected in the development of yet another leader of the movement . He is Norman Podhoretz , a writer , critic , editor and intellectual who emerged from college ( Columbia University ) in the late 1940s as a confirmed liberal who was increasingly anticommunist and anti-Soviet . This put him out of step with some of his contemporaries in the liberal community but did not damage either his professional or personal relations . Professionally , he won acclaim as a critic and commentator , and eventually he became editor of Commentary , turning it into one of the most distinguished journals of opinion in the world . Personally , he won friendships with a number of people who did not altogether agree with him . One such friendship was with Jason Epstein , who came out of Columbia and earned an immense success in book publishing . They became quite close  --  indeed , the closest of friends  --  in spite of their differences . " I belonged to a crowd which considered people like him intellectually unworthy , and he belonged to a crowd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember years later . " They were right about us  --  we were socially unworthy . " Their friendship was so intense , and their mutual esteem so high , that Jason Epstein offered Podhoretz  --  and Podhoretz almost accepted  --  the editorship of a new journal of opinion that Jason was influential in starting . It was called the New York Review of Books , and it became celebrated in its own way  --  often for what it said about politics more than for what it said about books . If Podhoretz had taken the offer to become editor , his life would have been markedly changed , and so also would have the nature  --  and the existence  --  of the neo-conservative movement . For the riots , the murders , the violence which shook the nation in the 1960s drove a blunt-edged ax blade into the conscience of the liberal community . One splinter  --  to which Podhoretz belonged  --  considered violence to be irrational ; the people in this group felt that it had to be rejected as a policy because nothing useful , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violence and anarchy . The members of another group seemed to welcome the turbulence . It satisfied their emotional and intellectual needs . Emotionally : Having long been locked into a feeling that " America is Evil , " they wanted , they needed to see their nation torn and bleeding , to see it humiliated , to see it brought to its knees . Intellectually : It was a precious tenet of communism that all the free and capitalist nations would eventually be torn apart internally and that the " oppressive , slave-holding tyrants " who govern them would be replaced by a " people 's proletariat . " Thus a good many pro-Soviet liberals believed , even wished , that this was the moment it was happening in America . To some of these people , any issue was deserving to be dramatized with a riot or two . ( The riots at the University of California at Berkeley  --  the granddaddy of all campus riots  --  started over whether and where people could make speeches just outside the campus grounds without compromising the university or interfering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , the resolution of some profoundly important issues was blocked by the violence of the times . No president  --  not Lyndon Johnson , certainly not Richard M. Nixon  --  could take the vital steps needed to end the Vietnam war for fear of looking as if he 'd given in to the rioters at home as well as the communists in Vietnam . Thus the rioters who protested against the war actually helped to prolong the war  --  and helped take the lives of thousands of young Americans by doing it . Similarly , the progress toward insuring achievement of the legitimate goals of blacks and other minorities was checked as attention shifted over to the urban riots , the fire-bombings and the assassinations ; the violence , not the needs of the minorities , became the issue . But there were a number of liberals  --  now radicalized  --  who felt that the riots and the violence were somehow more valuable than equal rights for blacks because violence helped advance the cause of chaos . For chaos , they expected , would bring about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bring about the rise of a new order . Perhaps led by  --  if you can believe this without laughing  --  an Abbie Hoffman or a Jerry Rubin . It was not just those among the poor , the downtrodden , the frustrated who exalted violence and chaos and the " corning revolution . " It also included a good many well-to-do people of some accomplishment and sophistication . Social commentator Tom Wolfe went to a party of such sophisticates  --  a fund raiser for the Black Panthers at the apartment of conductor Leonard Bernstein  --  and he came away with some devastating insights that he memorialized as the character of the " radical chic . " In reality , not many of these people were deeply committed to revolution , and certainly not a revolution which would strip them of their money and their status . They were more likely merely going along with the crowd . They were there because their friends were there . They simply wanted to be accepted as being " in fashion , " regardless of what the fashion was . Moreover , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had a particular appeal to some among the " radical chic . " It was that the United States was as evil as Nazi Germany and that the president was Hitler incarnate . Norman Podhoretz did not go for this line . " Not only did I reject the view that the United States was as evil in its way as Nazi Germany had been , I even objected to the idea that it was evil in any de-gree , " he has observed . He conceded that there were things wrong within our socie-ty ; no people are perfect . " But evil ? Beyond redemption ? In need of and deserving to be overthrown by force and violence ? " No  --  not at all . He did not even see America 's participation in the Vietnam war as an indication of evil . Personally , he was against our getting into so distant and difficult and futile a war ? " a piece of arrogant stupidity " ? and he was for withdrawing at any time " through a negotiated settlement that would keep the communists from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not consider the war an excess of evil on the part of America . Rather he con-sidered it an excess of idealism ? " mak-ing good on John Kennedy 's famous promise that we would ' pay any price and bear any burden ' to hold the line against communist expansion . " All this made him " out , " if not a " non-person , " to the more radical liberals . He could not be physically punished for not conforming , but he could be isolated , he could be excluded , he could be shunned by the " only people that mattered . " He could be gossiped about in the most vicious of ways . It was the next best thing to physical assassination ; it was character assassination and it was the supreme indulgence of liberals in New York and Washington . Naturally there was an interest in wounding Podhoretz economically , but it was difficult because he was so successful as editor of Commentary . What was all the more frustrating to Podhoretz ' adversaries is that the magazine reflected his views  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were persuasive and that they were reaching a kind of intellectual who was not available for the personal " discussions " of Podhoretz , his character and his sanity . Naturally Podhoretz had to test them : He wrote a book and that really tore it . For a book is an act of the individual , not of an organization or community . Few books of the last 15 years have so invited a demonstration of the temper of the community as Norman Podhoretz ' Making It . It was a detailed and thorough  --  some thought swaggering  --  perspective of his rise to eminence from the Brooklyn slums . His intent was to examine the nature of success in America and the way the lust for success is disguised by those who disdain success while coveting it . It is the lust for success that persuades some to clamor for doctrines that are not rational or reasonable because that assures them of the acceptance or approbation of the " community " that can provide them with success . But Podhoretz feels that a higher sense of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the backing of an extortionate community . That did it . It is one thing for a conservative to say that the liberals are all wrong  --  that could be dismissed . It is quite another for a liberal to say that liberals do n't matter and that " they " ca n't hurt him . For that is an open challenge to them at least to give it a good try  --  which they did . The first thing he discovered is that his agent wanted no part of makingthis view public ; his book publisher felt the same way . Jason Epstein 's firm stepped in to publish the book ( though Jason Epstein himself did not take part in the project ) . When the book came out , the critics on the Left greeted it like sharks tasting fresh meat . Podhoretz and his work were savaged in the newspapers , in the magazines , on the air , in gossip , in conversation on every liberal level . The New York Review of Books turned to support of the radicals and their viewpoint ; just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghettos in the country , the publication decided it was serving its readership by printing on its cover a diagram of how to make a fire bomb . Quite naturally , its viewpoint clashed with that of Commentary , and gradually the in-fighting between Commentary and the New York Review of Books became one of the prime entertainments of  --  and points of antagonism in  --  the New York intellectual community . The meaningful thing about all this is that the neo-conservative movement , and its momentum , developed out of a need of its leaders to defend themselves against their friends . It did not really develop  --  as did so many other third-party movements  --  out of a thirst for power or a preoccupation with the " pleasures " of politics . For as politicians , the neo-conservatives could not even agree on a party or a candidate , much less get together on organizing a party for a candidate . Take Pat Moynihan , the only professional politician among the neoconservatives : He found it extremelydifficult to stick with the shelter of one party . For years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration of John F. Kennedy . In 1968 , he worked readily for Bobby Kennedy , but then  --  with Kennedy dead and the Republicans coming to power  --  he switched after the election and joined the Republicans as a White House aide to Richard M. Nixon , who was despised by most Democrats and all Kennedys . Moynihan went on to hold a number of high offices under the Republicans and to win his greatest celebrity in them . But after Watergate , when the trend to the Democrats became clear , Moynihan became a Democrat again and  --  though he held neo-conservative principles  --  he won his Senate seat from New York as a Democrat . But even Moynihan does not have the organizational skills to put together a successful new party . Nor do the other neo-conservatives . That is why the neo-conservatives are a movement of influence and not a party . But it is also why they are a success : They concentrate on what they do well and skip what they do poorly . The other fringe-party movements are not as acute ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skills , much less with their destiny . They might learn much from the neo-conservatives : Where the fringe parties are seeking votes , the neo-conservatives are seeking influence . The situation is this : The electorate has  --  or has had  --  a choice of candidates other than those of the Democratic and Republican parties . But it has no choice of candidates in the political movement which is perhaps the most popular and most influential outside the major party organizations . The neo-conservatives give the nation a philosophical alternative but not a political one . To be a party without politicians is only part of the act of statesmanship ; the party must risk taking the next step . For that is the only way it can meet the hopes and ambitions of the voter facing the might and inadequacies of the major political parties : " It is better to vote for what you want and not get it , " said Eugene V. Debs , " than to have to vote for what you do n't want and get it . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
