Here ' s a story you can take one of two ways . Feeling optimistic today ? Is the sun shining ? Did your boss just give you a raise ? In that case , the Bulls ' 110-106 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers Wednesday night is reason for hope . On the bright side , George " the Iceman " Gervin finally thawed out . He scored 25 points on 11-for-21 shooting and fell into a rhythm reminiscient of his famed San Antonio shootouts . Want more ? Orlando Woolridge scored a game-high 34 points , Sidney Green muscled for as many rebounds ( 16 ) as Philly ' s Moses Malone and scored 14 points , and the Bulls overcame a 62-45 halftime deficit to come within a handful of shots from upsetting the Sixers . The Bulls bounced back to respectability Wednesday after a humiliating 132-103 shellacking by Milwaukee the night before . Now , for the pessimists out there , this was still the Bulls ' sixth loss in seven games , dropping them to 4-6 . You could believe the 76ers simply became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it with their reserves doing the damage in the second quarter . " Everybody thought this game was won after halftime , " said Philadelphia guard Maurice Cheeks . " No game is won by the third quarter . Michael Jordan wasn ' t playing , but we can ' t worry about who is and who isn ' t . We let them have some easy baskets and let them back into the game . " The Bulls ran off 10 straight points near the end of the third quarter to slice an 84-68 Sixers ' lead to six points . It was part of a 14-3 Chicago surge , led by Gervin , Woolridge and Gene Banks . Bobby Jones ' basket ended it and left the Bulls trailing 86-78 going into the fourth quarter . Kyle Macy ' s basket with 7 minutes 20 seconds left brought the Bulls to 95-90 . Philadelphia built the lead to 102-90 with 4 : 56 to go , but the Bulls continued to chip away . They cut it to 107-103 with 20 seconds to play on Woolridge ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It felt much better , " Gervin said . He had been greeted with an article that said " the Ice has melted " when he arrived here Wednesday . " All the people who have been doubting me haven ' t given me a fair chance . This situation has been a major change for me  --  new team , new city , new home . " I ' m only 33 . I ' m still a young man . It ' s not that I ' m old , I ' ve just been there . I ' ve just been around . I appreciate being around that long . I ' ve seen guys when they were little kids , and now they ' re young men coming around and playing with me . " He was talking about someone like Green . " Ice has been my idol since I was a sophomore in high school , " Green said . " When I read that stuff about the Ice melting , I was upset . " He apparently took out his anger on the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s greatest rebounders . Green came away with critical rebounds . " I wanted to win so bad , " Green said . " I ' m not intimidated by anyone in this league . " I ' m trying to concentrate more on rebounding , because that ' s what the team needs from me to win . People have to give us some time . We ' re new guys playing for a new coach under a new system . We just want to stay around . 500 until Michael comes back . " Coach Stan Albeck admitted to a coaching blunder in the second quarter when his lineup consisted of " nonscorers . " " Yes , that was my fault , " he said . " I did a poor job with the substitutions . " I ' ve been saying all along , Ice is coming. for him to go in there and do what he did against a team like Philadelphia , that ' s vintage Gervin . He ' ll pick up the offensive slack and take some pressure off Orlando . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world-beater of a team the Bulls hung close to . These Sixers were missing Andrew Toney , who has broken bones in both feet . They came into the Spectrum before 10 , 338 partisans with a . 500 record and a lineup of aging stars . They also seemed a bit blase about playing the Jordan-less Bulls , who didn ' t win a game here last season without him . How could they expect to do better ? " We need to play every possible way we can , and not worry if Jordan isn ' t here , " Cheeks said . " We can ' t let our minds drift . Right now , we ' re a little ways away from being our usual selves . " CAPTION : PHOTO : AP Laserphoto .
