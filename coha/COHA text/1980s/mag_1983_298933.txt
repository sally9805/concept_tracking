Press freedom outweighs an ex-President 's copyright <P> Memoirs of major public officials are big business . Presidents and prominent members of their Cabinets can often make more money writing about their time in office than they earned in salary while serving . Publishers are eager for such books , in part because they can make extra profits and garner valuable publicity with the sale of first serial rights to magazines . But as authors , what do the newsmakers own and when do they own it ? <P> In May 1979 , Harper &; Row and the Reader 's Digest Association were set to publish A Time to Heal , an account by Gerald Ford of his life and presidency . Shortly before the book was due out , the Nation ( circ. 48,000 ) , a leftist weekly , summarized Ford 's account of his pardon of Richard Nixon , using a stolen copy of the book without Ford 's permission . A U.S. district court ruled that the Nation had taken the former President 's work in violation of the federal copyright laws , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the sum represented the fee that the publishers lost when TIME , which had purchased first magazine publication rights , withdrew under a contractual provision after the Nation article appeared . <P> Backed by volunteer lawyers who perceived a threat to free-press rights , the Nation went to a federal appeals court , where last week , in a 2-to-1 ruling , the magazine won a ringing reversal . What the Nation had done , said Judge Irving Kaufman , writing for the majority , was merely to describe " political events of major significance , involving a former President of the United States . " <P> The widely followed case pitted the right to literary ownership , or copyright , against the principle of a free press . Copyright , said Kaufman , covers not " ideas or facts , " but the author 's " expression . " In the case of highly newsworthy books , this means only " the ordering and choice of the words themselves . " Otherwise , he went on , " an individual could be the owner of an important political event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " Copyright law " was not meant to obstruct the citizens ' access to vital facts and historical observations about our nation 's life . " <P> Kaufman noted that Editor Victor Navasky of the Nation had paraphrased most of what Ford wrote . Only 300 words of the 2,250-word article were taken verbatim from the manuscript . This brief borrowing of copyrighted material without the author 's consent , said the court , was " fair use , " a concept that allows limited quotation by journalists , critics , teachers and researchers . Dissenting Judge Thomas Meskill found a problem in the straightforward nature of the paraphrasing , however . " Copyright laws protect originality , " he wrote . " They thus offer protection against a work that is substantially an unoriginal appropriation of the copyrighted work . "
