But for Carol Young , neither prospect presents so much as a goose bump . Her heating bill in the winter of 1984-85 came to exactly nothing . And that zero bill included plenty of zero weather in Denver. // Ms. Young ' s house , south of the city , is exceptional , but not as much as one might imagine . There are thousands of houses that smugly and snugly respond to bitter cold with minuscule heating bills , often about $100 a year . Even the coldest climes on the continental United States push these super houses into just $200 in annual fuel costs. // // They are built with a technique known as superinsulation , one that involves beefing up insulation and plugging air leaks . Young ' s house relies on both superinsulated and passive solar heating . A 2 , 500-square-foot house , it has a furnace that is a small , gas-fired unit made for mobile homes . She didn ' t use it at all last year . ' ' And we had a week that was 24 below , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The combination of superinsulation and solar heating kept the house warm all through the siege ( the sun heats her house , and the superinsulation holds the heat through three days of clouds ) . Young admits to using her wood-burning stove about a dozen times , but only for ' ' convivial occasions , not for heating , ' ' she says. // Enthusiasts see superinsulation as the essence of energy-efficient home design , fulfilling the promise - but not the expense - held out by solar energy . An estimated 10 , 000 superinsulated houses have been built in the United States , most of them over the last five years . Chris Granda , a residential building energy analyst , expects another 10 , 000 will be up as of the end of the year . They range from elaborate custom homes to modest tract houses. // Superinsulation has a number of supporters around the country. // // * Minnesota subsidizes superinsulated construction and teaches the techniques in vocational schools. // // * The Farmers Home Administration has a program to encourage superinsulation in Maine. // // * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * Builders in Colorado and Montana are so confident about the energy savings of their superinsulated houses that they pay customers ' heating bills for one to three years. // // * The Northwest Power Council , which covers Washington , Oregon , Idaho , and Montana , encourages superinsulation and offers limited subsidies. // // * In South Dakota , a building code that went into effect this year requires superinsulation in houses eligible for state mortgage money earmarked for first-time home buyers . State Energy Office director Merwyn Larson estimates the measure will cut average energy bills 60 to 80 percent . ' ' There ' s no reason for heat to cost more than $150 to $200 a year , ' ' he says . And this in a state where the thermometer notches in at - 30 degrees F. during the winter. // ' ' We felt very strongly that we should be giving these people a good home with a low energy bill and do something to improve the housing stock in South Dakota at the same time , ' ' says Mr. Larson . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , R25 in the walls , R11 in the basement ; air tightness ; and mechanical control of ventilation . Mr. Larson figures the new code will add 4 percent to overall construction costs. // Mr. Granda traces the superinsulation trend , in part , to the chilly Canadian province of Saskatchewan , where , about six years ago , an architectural firm wanted to build a state-of-the-art , energy-efficient house . ' ' They thought that meant solar , ' ' he says , ' ' but they decided to soup up the insulation to keep the heat they were gaining from the solar . ' ' As circumstance would have it , an integral part for the solar mechanism failed to arrive by completion time . The house , however , ' ' performed brilliantly without it , ' ' Granda says . The idea caught on , to the point where the Canadian government now sponsors a superinsulation project - R2000 - that subsidizes builders who use the technique. // The goal of superinsulation , says Ski Milburn , a Boulder , Colo. , architect whose company specializes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house that requires no heating whatsoever , one that is heated entirely by body heat from the people who are in it and the waste heat from appliances. ' ' // While that goal is attainable - Ms. Young ' s house comes comfortably close - it ' s also expensive . Houses that pull in with $100 to $200 annual heating bills are more practical and cost an extra 4 or 5 percent to build. // ' ' For an extra 15 percent in building costs , ' ' says Mr. Milburn , ' ' a house can cut heating costs to zero . . . . For an extra 5 percent , it can cut heating costs by 50 to 90 percent. ' ' // Milburn ' s architectural firm started out seven years ago emphasizing passive solar design as the most energy efficient , but ' ' superinsulation is taking on a lot more power , ' ' he says . ' ' It ' s more cost effective , and in a lot of the country it ' s much more practical . For solar , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed with abundant sunshine . Generally , the colder the temperature , the less the sunshine. ' ' // Despite the name , insulation plays a secondary role in these super-cozy homes . ' ' Of primary importance is making sure the house is airtight , ' ' says Granda , ' ' because in a conventional house , up to 50 percent of heat . . . loss comes from air leaking out . That holds true no matter where you build a house , North Dakota or Florida . You will save yourself a lot of money just by making it tight. ' ' // Depending on the climate , designers then pack the walls with insulation valued at R20 to R30 - the attic with R40 and the basement with R10-20 . Since standard walls lack the thickness for that level of fiber-glass insulation , the design often requires double walls. // There are a variety of ways to seal up a house , and a number of companies - with names such as House Doctor and Sherlock Homes - have opened up to meet the growing demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following trails left by a smoke generator to the leaks : It ' s like filling a balloon full of water to find holes. // Caulking around windows and door frames and foam around electrical outlets and plumbing holes generally plug the leaks on existing houses . For new construction , superinsulation installers usually wrap the inside walls with huge sheets of plastic before nailing up the drywall. // Jim Thompson , a Denver builder , followed a different technique in building a 48-unit , single-family development in Erie , Colo . With widely spaced post-and-beam framing , the outside walls consist entirely of superinsulated panels : four inches of foam sandwiched between wafer board and drywall , which seals the house and insulates at R30. // Young ' s house follows a similar pattern with foam panels in 4-by-8 sheets that were nailed to a post-and-beam frame. // Just plugging holes cuts heat loss significantly . Houses built now turn over the inside air two or three times an hour . Halving that figure with ' ' plugs ' ' is relatively simple . A superinsulated house , one designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air every hour . Young ' s house reduces the hourly turnover rate to 20 percent. // Ironically , the air tightness that helps insulate a house also presents one of the biggest problems . Designing a house so that virtually all the heat stays indoors can also mean a house where most of the air stays put . That lack of ventilation leads to problems ranging from the unpleasant to the unhealthy . ' ' You can build a house that is literally too tight for human habitation , ' ' says architect Milburn. // The most accepted way of dealing with this indoor air pollution is an air-to-air heat exchanger , a device that pulls in outside cold air while pushing out inside stale air . The two pass each other in transit , allowing the exiting warm air to heat the entering colder air . ' ' A good air exchanger ( about $200 ) will recover about two-thirds of the heat in the air being exhausted , ' ' Milburn says . ' ' Some of the manufacturers claim 75 percent heat recovery , but I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field. ' ' // Superinsulation may be popular , but it is not new . The first such house was built in 1940 , says Granda , and ' ' Sweden has been building them for years ; 80 percent of all their houses are superinsulated . . . . It ' s been mandated by code for 11 years. ' ' // How fast it continues to catch on in the US depends largely on the builders ' perspective . Big builders ' ' won ' t go with it for five or 10 years or longer , ' ' says Steve Andrews , a Denver home energy consultant . But , he adds , ' ' I do foresee smaller builders getting into it , using it to differentiate their product. ' ' // // // //
