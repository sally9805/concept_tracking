The B-1B bomber is designed to deliver its deadly cargo at low altitude , following the contours of the ground to avoid being detected by radar . But last week the controversialplane proved vulnerable to a natural enemy when a B-1B crashed after running into a flock of birds . <P> The plane was on a simulated bombing run at the Air Force 's training range near La Junta , Colo. , when the pilot reported that a " bird ingestion " had caused fires in two of the craft 's engines . The plane immediately climbed to 15,500 ft. , presumably to give the crew time to jump , before crashing . The pilot 's final , terse transmission : " We 're going down . " Three of the six crewmen were able to parachute to safety . <P> Though the B-1B 's engines are designed to withstand most " bird strikes , " investigators suspect that large Canada geese may have caused the fatal fire .                    @
