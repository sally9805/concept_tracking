txt THE LATEST BUZZWORD echoing along Madison Avenue is " brand personality . " The phrase is defined by the research director of Young &; Rubicam , the largest UtS. ad agency , as " how people feel about a- brand rather than what the brand does . " Brand personality is being embraced by some agencies and their clients as the elusive quality that separates exceptional advertising from the ordinary . Marlboro has it , for example , but Pall Mall does n't . Charmin toilet paper does , too , but ScotTissue does n't . Kool-Aid has it ; Wyler 's powdered beverages do n't . " You want the consumer to say , ' That 's my kind of product , ' which is different from ' I need that product , ' " explains Kenneth Olshan , chairman of the domestic unit of Wells , Rich , Greene . The ad agency says the personality it created for Bic lighters helped them outsell Gillette 's Cricket . Using the theme " Why light up when you can flick your Bic ? , " Wells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ritual of smoking ; Cricket ads simply stressed the lighter 's durability . When properly developed , adds Grey Advertising , brand personality results " not just in ' purchase motivation ' but in a friendship between the product and the consumer . " Grey , which calls its version of the concept " brand character " and even has trademarked the term , also thinks it could lead to some new clients . Advises an internal Grey manual : " Brand character can be a great door-opener if used in systematic and aggressive manner . " SEVERAL TOP ADVERTISERS agree that better-developed personalities can improve advertising . Frito-Lay recently asked its three ad agencies for more research on the subject . Revlon , whose Charlie perfume ads are considered a model of a good brand personality , depends heavily on it when writing ads for its cosmetics . " You ca n't have a 100% success rate , " says Sanford Buchsbaum , advertising vice president , " but it gives you a better chance of success . " But skeptics wonder whether brand personality is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of successful selling . " Advertising people need something to talk about , " says David Furman , advertising manager for Bic . " This year 's fashion is brand personality . Several years ago it was ' positioning . ' " Defenders of the concept do n't disagree entirely . " Great advertising has always had brand character , " says Edward Meyer , Grey chairman , " but they stumbled upon it . " A personality has to be defined before it can be shaped . Some agencies are doing that by trying to describe the product as a person . Jell-O , for example , ' is that very nice lady who lives next door , " says Joseph Plummer , research director at Young &; Rubicam , the product 's agency . " She 's not too old-fashioned , loves children and dogs and has a little streak of creativity , but is n't avant-garde . " BECAUSE CONSUMERS OFTEN have difficulty articulating personality characteristics , researchers are using off-beat methods to find out how products are viewed . Young &; Rubicam asked interview subjects to pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Frito-Lay , and then discuss various situations in which they might be served . Other consumers were asked to associate headache remedies with famous people ; Excedrin was linked most often with Richard Nixon . Once a personality is defined , it can be used to determine such features as the tone , spokesman and locales for ads . In keeping with Oil of Olay 's character  --  described as " ageless , sophisticated , foreign , mysterious and slightly exotic " ? Young &; Rubicam designs exotic settings ; most skin-care products focus on a model . To graft Jell-O Pudding 's personality onto Jell-O Pudding Pops , a new frozen dessert , the agency chose Bill Cosby as its spokesman ; he 'd already starred in Jell-O Pudding ads . Personality also helps select TV programs to sponsor : Grey says it wo n't advertise Cycle dog food on comedies because it 's a " serious " product . Stepping out-of-character can lead to advertising flops . Grey learned that when it used the Eiffel Tower as the site for a No-Nonsense pantyhose commercial . In previous ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less glamorous settings . AN EFFECTIVE PERSONALITY , Grey concludes , is distinctive , appealing and lasts a long time , even though ad campaigns may change . " The litmus test is , " says Richard O'Brien , an executive vice president , " If I took the name out of the commercial , could you tell me the product ? ' " The exception is a product with unsatisfactory sales . Timex , which has n't kept up with trends in watch styles and technology , is trying to change its personality by abandoning spokesman John Cameron Swayze and its familiar timepiece torture tests . New ads show tennis players and fashionable young couples and emphasize technology instead of durability and price . Some ad executives fear , though , that formal testing and application of brand personality could restrain creativity . Says Wells Rich 's Mr. Olshan : " Bureaucracy is the enemy of this . " Still , the emphasis on personality is likely to grow . " In today 's marketplace , product categories are packed with competitive entries that seem , for all practical purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Purdy , a Young &; Rubicam creative director . And , because there 's often little difference between ads for competing products , he says , " the most distinctive thing about a brand may well be its personality . "
