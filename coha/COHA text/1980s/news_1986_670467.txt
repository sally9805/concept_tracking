" I know what it ' s like to be in the cellar , " Wilson said of his early years with the Mets , " to be at home during this time of year watching the World Series with a pizza and beer . I really don ' t know what I ' m thinking right now . I know I might appreciate this more , but you have to give credit to the young guys on this club . They showed the world you don ' t need 10 years ' experience and three in the playoffs to win. " // The Mets celebrated as a team last night , spilling and swigging the bubbly like hardened postseason performers . But to each player , the World Series championship had a special meaning , whether it was redemption or reaffirmation of a job well done throughout the year . The Mets won 116 games this season , but the final eight victories in the National League championship series and World Series were excruciating. // So Tim Teufel breathed a sigh of relief , thankful that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series against the Red Sox , 1-0 , would be a footnote overshadowed by the events of the sixth and seventh games . <> <> Saved From Scapegoat Role // " Personally , it was a draining Series , " Teufel said . " I took a lot of criticism for one play , and if we had lost , everyone would have looked at me . They would have viewed me on that one error and not the whole season. // " Now , " Teufel added , " maybe Bill Buckner will have to live with it . That ' s too bad . He ' s a good player . " Buckner ' s error allowed the winning run to score in the sixth game last Saturday night , when the Mets rallied for three runs and a dramatic 10th-inning victory , with two out and down to their last strike . Almost to a player , the Mets thought the sixth game was the one that decided this World Series . It gave them a feeling they could overcome any obstacle , such as the 3-0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I remember in that sixth game , having an empty feeling in the 10th inning and knowing I would feel that way all winter , " Wally Backman said . " I just would not have been satisfied without winning the World Series . But now , I can go home . " <> <> Strawberry Still Angry // The Saturday night comeback claimed a number of victims , even on the winning team . Darryl Strawberry was removed from the game in a lineup switch with the score tied because Dave Johnson , the Mets ' manager , could not afford to use another pitcher . Strawberry was angry in victory and said he did not think he could communicate with Johnson ever again. // Last night , as Kevin Mitchell emptied a bottle over his head , Strawberry said he still was hurt by the manager ' s decision but will try to understand the reasoning . " Davey is a fine man and we just disagreed on some things , " he said . " I know I ' m a clutch player , and after three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that kind of thing could happen to me anymore. // " I had a tough time in the World Series but I ' m surrounded by great players who helped pick us up . I ' m just happy I could contribute that home run tonight . To hit one in a World Series is a great thrill. " // Sid Fernandez had felt the sting of disappointment as well . He won 16 games this season , but faltered in the second half , and was dropped from the World Series rotation by Johnson . Fernandez stewed but kept his opinion to himself . He was used in relief three times , baffling the Red Sox the last two times . Last night , he struck out four and held them hitless in two and one-third innings , keeping his team in the game after they fell behind. // It can be argued that the Mets ' three-run rally that tied the score in the sixth inning began when Fernandez finished his work with a strikeout in the top half of the inning , waking a crowd that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were down at the time and I just wanted to hold them , " he said . " I used mostly fastballs and some curves . The last two times against Boston was the best my curve has been all year. // " I just told myself , don ' t sulk . Just do your best , " Fernandez said. // After winning the East Division championship , the test of the Mets ' fortitude did not come until the championship series against the Astros and the World Series . They took the lead in only three of their eight postseason victories. // But in winning when they had to , the Mets said they found an inner strength . " This clubhouse was loose before the game , " said Keith Hernandez , who drove in four runs last night . " Even when they led , 3-0 , we felt we would get to Bruce Hurst . And once we got to their bullpen , we felt we had it. " // Hernandez , the historian , said he thought this Mets team was better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jerry Koosman , Cleon Jones and Tommie Agee . " This is the greatest Mets team of all time , " he said . " Sure , we have weaknesses , no team can be solid all down the line . But this team is the best . " <> <> ' Fire in Their Eyes ' // Bob Ojeda , who was traded to the Mets by the Red Sox last winter and won 18 games this season , said he could tell before the game that his teammates had come with a purpose . " There was fire in their eyes , " he said . " And no one was down , even when we got behind. " // Darling , who had pitched so well twice before against the Red Sox , simply did not have command of his pitches this time . He allowed six hits and three runs in three and two-thirds innings , and was fortunate it was not more . All he could think about , however , was last Saturday night . A 3-0 deficit did not appear so insurmountable after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depicting the Mets championship , he said it would be of Jesse Orosco sinking to his knees after striking out Marty Barrett for the final out. // " I was frozen in the outfield , " Mookie Wilson said . " I thought , ' is it over ? " ' // Wally Backman felt the same way . The second baseman was not as nervous as he expected to be . " I remember as a kid , watching the World Series , I would have butterflies and my palms were sweaty , " he said . " I had some butterflies tonight , but it was easier being on the field than watching as a kid. " //
