After only four hours of sleep and a day spent thanking campaign workers and consulting with colleagues , Margaret Thatcher welcomed TIME London Bureau Chief Christopher Ogden and Reporter Frank Melville upstairs at No. 10 Downing Street to talk about her plans for a third term . Wearing a blue suit and her trademark double strand of pearls , she sat at a small table in an oak-paneled room . Behind her were congratulatory baskets of flowers . Excerpts from the interview : <P> Q. How do you interpret the election ? <P> A. It means that the policies we were pursuing , which we put openly and frankly before the people , were thought to be right for Britain . They were policies which were a partnership between government and people  --  namely , we do the things which only governments can do , running the finances in a sound way , keeping inflation down , cutting controls and giving tax incentives . And we got the response in an increasing enterprise and competitiveness from the British people . And that produced a higher standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lacking compassion ? <P> A. Some people think that to be compassionate and caring you have to talk a lot about it . We 've always taken the view that you should be judged by what you do and not by what you say , and we 're prepared to be judged on that  --  any day of the week . <P> Q. What are the most important accomplishments of your first eight years ? <P> A. First , we have reduced the fantastic number of controls that there were over the life of our society . The greatest driving force in life , which is individual energy and effort , was becoming really cocooned . Secondly , people do need incentives to encourage them to work harder , and if you take too much away in tax , then you will not get that driving incentive . Plus the trade union law . When we took over , it seemed as if the left-wing trade union leaders were more powerful than the government of the day . All of this has been replaced by different systems . We now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy is doing well and catching up with our European competitors . <P> Q. What are your plans for a third term ? <P> A. I will extend opportunities to people who never had them before . As you know , we are building a property-owning democracy . Far more people own their own homes now . We are nearly up to the United States  --  not yet quite  --  but now one in five of our people owns company shares . Far many more people have savings accounts . That 's all extending opportunity ever more widely . <P> Q. How far will you extend privatization ? <P> A. Some of our water has been supplied to people by private companies for years . The great amount of it is done under public authorities , and many of them tell us they would be able to run very much more efficiently if they were able to run their own operation . Also we shall then embark upon privatizing electricity , which you ( ( in the U.S. ) ) are used to . And then we 'll have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them onto the market  --  always , I must say , giving the people who work in those enterprises the first chance to purchase shares at an advantageous price . Our policy is that every earner shall be an owner . <P> Q. Is there increased anti-Americanism in this country at the moment ?
