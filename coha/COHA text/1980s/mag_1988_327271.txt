In and around Cincinnati live some 50 families who in an earlier time of myth and legend might have been accused of drinking from Ponce de Leon 's fountain of youth . Yet even in today 's pragmatic , scientific world , their arteries do seem to carry an elixir of long life . The members of these families , says investigator Dr. Dennis Sprecher of the University of Cincinnati , " typically live for long periods of time , into their 80s and 90s , with very few instances of heart disease , if indeed they have any at all . " <P> Doctors have discovered that these people carry in their blood a component that seems to protect them against the heart disease that plagues many in the Western world , where affluence has made fatty diets and physical inactivity a common way of life . Rose Sweeney , a head nurse at a Cincinnati hospital , is a member of one of the families . " I eat everything I want , " she says . " I do n't worry about it as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arteries . " Sweeney 's mother Regina Darpel , 86 , notes that other members of her family have lived well into their 90s . She has the same remarkable blood chemistry ; so do Sweeney 's five children and her sister . <P> What do these lucky people have in common ? They are united in a pact of longevity by the way their bodies process a waxy , odorless substance present in every human being : cholesterol . Cholesterol ? The nemesis of every health- conscious person ? The object of a swelling tide of medical diatribes against overeating and underexercising ? The primary cause of coronary heart disease , which last year caused 1.5 million heart attacks and 550,000 deaths in the U.S. ? How can this be ? Is n't cholesterol the enemy ? <P> Well , yes . But it is also becoming evident that cholesterol can be either foe or friend , depending on the way it travels through the body . Cholesterol 's sinister image derives from the fact that much of the substance is swept through the bloodstream by potentially damaging carrier particles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " bad " cholesterol because an excess of cholesterol carried by them can lead to the buildup of harmful deposits in the arteries . The other cholesterol carriers , known as HDLs ( for high-density lipoproteins ) , are considered " good " because , far from being killers , they may actually play a vital role in preventing heart disease . They seem to act like biological vacuum cleaners , sucking up excess cholesterol in the bloodstream . It is because the 50-odd Cincinnati families possess unusually high levels of HDL that they are believed to have such a resilient blood chemistry  --  and such long lives .
