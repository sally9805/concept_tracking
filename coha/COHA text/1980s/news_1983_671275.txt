The American official , who spoke to reporters after the Foreign Ministers of the United States , France , Britain and Italy met , would not characterize the attitude of the group as a whole on the question of reprisals . Also , while acknowledging that the four Ministers discussed the forces behind the attack , he refused to say if they agreed on a single explanation for the raids , which killed more than 275 American and French troops at two installations. // The Foreign Ministers did agree to press Lebanon ' s factions for quick results at reconciliation talks that begin Monday in Geneva. // That call won the full approval of the four participants . But the American disclosure of the discussion about a possible response to the Beirut bombings or other attacks clearly made the European participants nervous at a time when they all have stated their disapproval of the United States military action on Grenada. // <> <> Implied Threat Earlier // The American official ' s remarks came after what some European participants took as an implied threat of reprisals made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters in his aircraft on the way to Paris from Washington this morning . Asked what choices were available in relation to the attacks , Mr. Shultz replied that they appeared to have a pattern , and added : " I would only say that we have options and I expect we will exercise at least one of them. " // A French official , when told of the American report that reprisals were discussed at the meeting , was visibly upset and said , " That wasn ' t the sense of things. " // But Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson , talking to reporters later , appeared less cautious . He said : " The United States thinks you can reply by fire , even when you are not attacked . We only reply to attacks . There is a marked difference in the latitude of intervention. " // Apart from the standing French interest in demarcating its Middle East positions from those of the United States - " We have our differences , " Mr. Cheysson said , notably on the role of the Palestinians - there appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military move relating to Beirut that would not necessarily have the approval of the other countries in the peacekeeping force. // Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy did not deal directly with the question of reprisals , but said , " Someone just can ' t go up to the Gianicolo " - a hill in Rome - " and start shooting because he feels threatened. " // <> <> Pessimism on Geneva Talks // Although the Europeans insisted , as the Americans did , that the meeting was useful , the talk of discussion of reprisals left them with a palpable sense of discomfort. // Mr. Cheysson , who served as spokesman for the Ministers , reiterated the Governments ' support for the multinational force , condemned the bombings of the paratroopers and marines as " horrible terrorism " and said the peacekeepers were going to try to improve their consultations and coordination on all levels. // The essential political element of the Ministers ' consultation was an agreement to press the Lebanese factions to move quickly at Geneva , a task regarded with considerable pessimism by the allies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy formula for withdrawing the multinational force and re-establishing a semblance of stability in Lebanon. // Mr. Cheysson said the Governments called on the Lebanese groups meeting in Geneva " to get along with each other in order to talk in the name of a unified Lebanon. // " Lebanon ' s unity , " Mr. Cheysson he said , " is the indispensable condition so that this country can achieve the withdrawal of all the foreign forces and the support of its neighbors in its development . " <> <> Impatience With Lebanese // Mr. Shultz , on his flight back to the United States , was quoted as having indicated to reporters that although the United States , France , Britain and Italy remained committed to keeping military forces in Lebanon , there was some impatience now at the inability of Lebanese officials to form a cohesive government . " There is a real feeling - and it was expressed in our meeting - that the leaders of Lebanon owe the people of Lebanon and the international community a real effort to throw themselves together , " Mr. Shultz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost countless opportunities , which would create the kind of prosperous life that Lebanon is capable of producing , " he said . " The people of Lebanon are the big losers and that ' s what they have to think seriously about. " // Mr. Shultz also said the Government of Iraq could play a role in efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East . " I think Iraq does have a potential constructive role to play in the Arab consideration of the Mideast peace process , " he said. // The American official who briefed reporters on the talks today in Paris said that there would be no change in the makeup or activities of the multinational force , and that the group had talked of a possible greater role for United Nations forces , a position advocated by France for several months . Each peacekeeping group , he said , would soon send a high-ranking officer to Beirut to try to improve the units ' security . The general discussion , he went on , included the Iran-Iraq conflict and the potential threats to shipping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In talking to reporters on the way to Paris , Mr. Shultz complained about Israel ' s withdrawal of its troops from the Shuf Mountain region in Lebanon . He said the United States had advised against the move , which resulted in " a great deal of conflict. " // Since the Israeli pullout , Mr. Shultz said , " there has been a perception in Syria of a different attitude of Israel that has made quite an impact on the situation . " The Secretary of State appeared to be saying that the Israeli withdrawal reduced the incentives for Syria to pull back its own forces from Lebanon. // The issue of Grenada did not come up directly at the plenary session at the Chateau de la Celle-St. - Cloud , near Paris , Mr. Cheysson said , but it was a subject in a meeting between Mr. Shultz and Mr. Cheysson , and in another later with Sir Geoffrey Howe , the British Foreign Secretary. // Sir Geoffrey , in a reference to his Government ' s criticism of the United States ' role in the Grenada invasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been brought up to date by Mr. Shultz. // " The important thing now , " he said , " is that as the initiative has been taken in Grenada , it should be brought to a successful outcome and the U.S. forces withdrawn as soon as possible to allow democratic elections for a democratic government.
