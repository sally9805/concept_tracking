Instamatic encore <P> The country may have gone camera crazy , all decked out in snouty lenses , fancy light meters and the designer bags needed to pack the paraphernalia . But amateur photographers using amateur equipment still get all too many amateur results . Underexposed or blurry pictures , for example , that never show up in those happy photo-equipment advertisements . <P> Last week Eastman Kodak Co. , the world 's largest supplier of photographic equipment to the multibillion dollar amateur market , took a giant step toward the elimination of misbegotten pictures . The company 's solution is a compact new camera called Disc . Said Modern Photography Contributing Editor David Eisendrath after trying the photo mite : " It is virtually idiot proof . " <P> The Disc is the most important innovation from Kodak since the Instamatic cartridge cameras of almost 20 years ago that caused a huge jump in the number of pictures taken by the average snap-shooter . Convinced that it has something to shout about , the company will push a $100 million ad blitz aimed at hitting 95% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . <P> Slightly larger than a cigarette case , the new camera does everything but process film . It performs a split-second analysis of distance and brightness , sets the proper exposure , activates a flash if needed and advances the film while the flash recharges . The focal length is so short - 12.5 mm - that everything from 4 ft. to infinity is in focus at all times , eliminating any need for a lens that turns and focuses . Two of the three new models can snap objects only 18 in. away . <P> Much technological wizardry went into the Disc . Unlike other consumer-oriented cameras that use optically undistinguished lenses , the Disc lens is made of four glass elements that Kodak claims are " close to theoretical perfection . " The camera 's electronics and flash systems are powered by a new lithium battery that lasts for 2,000 exposures , easily the life of the camera . Most revolutionary of all is the revolving film pack . The new cameras use a thin , 2-in. - diameter plastic disc that is priced at $3.19 . The disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a motor for each of its 15 exposures . <P> Wall Street analysts say that the new Disc system could have the same ballooning effect on film sales for Kodak as did the Instamatic . There will be competitors , but not for quite a while , say the experts , because the camera 's complexity and the intricacy of its lens make it difficult to manufacture . The Disc should come in handy , too , in Kodak 's battle against such alternative picture-taking methods as video cameras and Sony 's filmless electronic-imaging technology . Though Kodak has no production plans now , the Disc can easily be adapted to show , say , slides over a television set .
