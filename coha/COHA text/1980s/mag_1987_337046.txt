In their first comprehensive statement on the AIDS crisis , the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops last week announced a considerable concession to the disease 's grim reality . Despite the church 's continued opposition to the use of condoms by married and unmarried persons alike , the bishops will now reluctantly accept the publicizing of information on the devices in public- education campaigns and school classes . Some people simply " will not refrain from the type of sexual or drug-abuse behavior which can transmit AIDS , " the bishops acknowledged .
