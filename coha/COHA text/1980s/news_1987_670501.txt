Although analysts had predicted that the index would rise by more than the two-tenths of a point recorded in each of the three preceding months , the result exceeded general expectations and prompted some to express uneasiness about price trends. // " It ' s clearly a sign that we ' re back into a higher inflation mode - and it ' s not just temporary , " said John Hagens , an economist at Chase Econometrics. // Marlin Fitzwater , the White House spokesman , called the January result " disappointing. " // But other economists remained unperturbed about the January upturn , noting that much of it reflected higher oil prices , which have turned down again since the index survey was conducted , and a rise in the volatile food sector. // " Today ' s number is just a happenstance , a confluence of some events that are not likely to continue , " said Joel Popkin , a consultant who formerly was a senior official and price specialist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. // Mr. Popkin said he still expected consumer prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . Because of higher prices for imported goods and for oil , most economists anticipate that 1987 inflation will run between 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 percent , up from 1. 1 percent last year , the slimmest rise in a quarter-century. // Walter M. Cadette , an economist at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company , called the January figure " a little on the high side " but said he saw nothing " that would be alarming . " <> <> New Weightings Used // The January figure was the first to incorporate new weightings of consumer spending patterns , updating the market basket of goods and services to the 1982-84 period from the 1972-73 weightings that had been used since the preceding index revision that was made in 1978. // Under the " old " series , which will continue to be published for comparative purposes through June , the index climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent , unadjusted for seasonal variations . The " new " index rose six-tenths of 1 percent before seasonal adjustment. // Sharply higher prices for gasoline and the biggest jump in heating oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect , accounted for about one-third of the total rise in the January index , the department said. // The food and beverage , apparel , housing , transportation and other goods and services components all rose substantially more than in December , while the medical care and entertainment components showed less rapid advances . <> <> Price Increases Widespread // The fact that the price increases were so widespread was one of the most unsettling factors to those who have begun to worry about accelerating inflation . When both energy and food are excluded , the index rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month , twice the average increase for November and December. // Services rose four-tenths of 1 percent in January , up from three-tenths in the two preceding months , while commodities , including energy , jumped 1 percent after edging up only one-tenth of 1 percent in November and December. // " We are now beginning to see imported inflation from the lower dollar , " said David Berson , a senior economist at Wharton Econometrics. // Mr. Popkin , however , insisted that the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be small . " One reason , he said , is that newly industrialized countries - such as South Korea and Taiwan - had taken over from Japan as price setters in many categories of goods , and their currencies had not appreciated against the dollar. // Over all , the rise of seven-tenths of 1 percent in the January index was the biggest since a 1. 1 percent surge in June 1982. // Of the seven main index components , the biggest increase by far was the 1. 5 percent rise in the price of transportation . More than two-thirds of this was accounted for by motor fuel , but prices also rose for new vehicles , used cars , automobile finance charges , car insurance and public transportation . <> <> Heating Oil Up 9. 8% // In housing , which now accounts for 42. 9 percent of the index , the three chief subgroups - shelter , fuel and other utilities , and household furnishings and operations - contributed to the price acceleration . Heating oil jumped 9. 8 percent , while natural gas rose four-tenths of 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in interstate telephone calls was offset by large price increases for local service , cable television , refuse collection and water and sewer service . Sharp increases were posted for television sets and other video and sound equipment , the department said. // In food , grocery store prices climbed four-tenths of 1 percent , reflecting sizable increases for fruits and vegetables , carbonated beverages , sugar , fish , restaurant meals , frozen foods and alcoholic beverages . Pork , poultry and eggs fell . Elsewhere , the department reported a 2 percent jump in the price of tobacco products and sizable rises for schoolbooks and supplies , tuition and other school fees and legal services. // The C.P.I.-W , covering urban wage earners and clerical workers , rose by the same seven-tenths of 1 percent as the more popular C.P.I.-U. which covers all urban consumers , the department reported . <> <> COMPONENTS OF THE C.P.I. **22;9549; <> **42;9573; **42;9617; **42;9661; **42;9705; <> **76;9749; <> **28;9827; Index <> **28;9857; Pct . <> **28;9887; Pct. <> <> **76;9917; <> **28;9995; for <> **28;10025; chng. from <> **28;10055; chng. from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec.
