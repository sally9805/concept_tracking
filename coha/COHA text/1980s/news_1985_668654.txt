Few institutions are as quintessentially French as the Comedie Francaise , the oldest and finest of France ' s national theaters where classic drama packs the house year-round . Few French playwrights are as beloved as Georges Feydeau , the master of farce and vaudeville who slashed at 19th-Century bourgeois morality with the razor of ridicule . To know this is to know that Stuart Seide has made history . This summer , the 39-year-old Brooklyn , N.Y. , native became the first American ever to direct at the Comedie Francaise . For his debut , he chose three one-act farces by Feydeau that will be presented until January . " I said to myself , if an American is going to do something at the Comedie Francaise , it might as well be something from the French repertory , " Seide said in a recent interview . " Let ' s play the game all the way , let ' s go for broke . " Seide , a Paris resident since 1970 , is no newcomer to French theater circles . His productions of plays by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Racine ' s " Andromache " and Harold Pinter ' s " Homecoming " last year have won wide acclaim , earning him healthy subsidies from the French Culture Ministry . Seide has been involved with theater since he landed a bit part in a school play at 16 . " I guess I was bitten by the bug , " he says . " Theater opened up a whole new world for me . " Although he was delighted to have the privilege of working at the Comedie Francaise , Seide sees no reason why such a fuss has been made over his choice of Feydeau . " Feydeau , like all art , belongs to the world , " he said . " After all , you don ' t have to be Polish to play Chopin . " Seide ' s production of " Hortense a dit ' je m ' en fous , ' " ( " Hortense said , ' I don ' t give a darn ' " ) , " Leonie est en avance " ( " Leonie Is Early " ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s Late Mother " ) drew mixed reviews from French drama critics . Gilles Costaz , writing in the Socialist-leaning Le Matin , praised Seide ' s subdued approach to the three farces , adding that anyone outraged by an American at the Comedie Francaise was simply " someone who had nothing else to say . " He was referring to Francois Chalais who sniped in the daily tabloid France Soir : " Miracle at the Comedie Francaise . Someone has managed to make Feydeau boring . That feat has been accomplished by an American implanted in France . " " I have never seen such a gap between what ' s written , and what ' s happening every night , " Seide retorted . " The house is full , people are laughing and applauding their heads off . They don ' t think it ' s boring . " Seide ' s production plays down the burlesque and puts heavy emphasis on what goes on between the characters . " I ' m faithful to the period , but not to the vaudeville tradition , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garish colors that get a laugh upon entrance . For Seide , Feydeau ' s laughter is bittersweet . A husband wearing a chamber pot on his head to please his pregnant wife ; a maid acting unrepentant after her cat has urinated on her mistress ' s fur muff ; an unfaithful drunken husband telling his wife her breasts sag like coat hangers  --  these side-splitting scenes reveal nothing less than what Seide calls marital anguish . " I don ' t want to say Feydeau is realistic , but he describes what is . People don ' t listen to one another . All the characters just think about themselves , and it ' s a tragic situation , " he said . Seide sees Feydeau as symbolizing Paris today , where " people talk fast , a lot and very often for nothing at all . " But like generations of expatriate Americans who flocked to the French capital , Seide is neither ready to leave nor unhappy at being on the outside . " I like the idea of being apart . The solitude is sometimes depressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing through  --  going to where you don ' t know , " said Seide , the son of an Austrian doctor who reached the United States after World War I. Most important , he said , was breaking ties with his childhood , family and culture , which makes you " ask yourself who you are as an individual. "
