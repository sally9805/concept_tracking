Every year the people of Vitoria , a Basque community in northern Spain , celebrate the fiestas of the Virgen Blanca , the city 's patron saint . Last week the annual merrymaking was disrupted when about 1,000 youths who had been drinking at fiesta street bars began chanting slogans in support of the Basque terrorist organization ETA . The demonstration soon developed into a riot in which 48 people , including ten police , were injured and tens of thousands of dollars in damage was done to public buildings . <P> The rioters were protesting the French government 's crackdown on suspected ETA terrorists who have fled to France . Basque separatists have traditionally used the southwest of France as a haven and headquarters for planning future attacks , but in recent weeks France has handed over five young Basques to Spain . In a pre-riot visit to Madrid , French Security Minister Robert Pandraud said the deportations would continue .
