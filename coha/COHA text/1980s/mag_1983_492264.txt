The first emphatic announcement of Ozzie Smith 's arrival in baseball 's major leagues came at a steamy Atlanta stadium during the summer of 1978 . Smith , a rookie , was playing shortstop for the feckless San Diego Padres when Atlanta slugger Jeff Burroughs hit an apparent single to center . An apparent single to everyone , that is , except Ozzie Smith . The game mattered little in the standings and , according to Smith , also meant little to a number of his teammates . But to Smith , a self-conscious artist who revels in his opportunities to perform and perfect the infielder 's art , the game  --  every game  --  mattered a great deal more . " Playing shortstop is very important to me , " he says earnestly , " because I take so much pride in it . " Possessed of finely honed reactions , feline quickness and an intense concentration , Smith was off to his left at the crack of Burroughs ' bat and airborne in three strides . But even as he dove to overtake the ball traversing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caromed unexpectedly in the direction from which he 'd come . Body extended parallel to the ground , all Smith could do was thrust his bare right hand behind him and snare the ball before falling to the infield dirt . Then , incredibly , he scrambled to his feet in time to throw Burroughs out by a step . The Atlanta crowd gave him a standing ovation . The play was caught on videotape and replayed repeatedly throughout the season , eventually being dubbed baseball 's " play of the year . " At mention of his bit of legerdemain against Burroughs , a smile quickly creases Ozzie Smith 's bearded face . " It was the thing that reallygot me on the map , " recalls the man known since his boyhood in Los Angeles as the " Wizard of Oz . " " From that point on , it opened people 's eyes . ' Wait a minute ! ' they said . ' I did n't see that ! That did n't happen ! ' " Five seasons later , Ozzie , 28 , is baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare quality arc anticipated whenever Osborne Earl Smith takes the field . Those fans privileged to see him play regularly insist he performs some magical maneuver about once per game . " If you told Ozzie , ' Nice going , ' every time he made a great play , you 'd be over there patting him on the back all the time , " says his manager , Whitey Herzog . It was Herzog , doubling at the time as general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals , who traded for Smith before the 1982 season . He gave up several players , including a shortstop with a lifetime batting average 74 points higher than Smith 's . By season 's end , Herzog 's judgment was amply confirmed as the Cardinals became world champions and Smith was widely recognized as the current master among shortstops , on a plane with such modern greats as Marty Marion , Pee Wee Reese , Phil Rizzuto and Luis Aparicio . Red Schoendienst , himself one of the premier second basemen of the 1940s and ' 50s and now a Cardinals coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got great hands . He 's quick . His hands and feet are quick . That 's what makes an infielder and a shortstop . His arm is good . He can dive for a ball and bounce up quicker than anybody I 've ever seen . I 've seen a lot of great shortstops , outstanding shortstops , and he 's right with them . " " I did n't realize how talented Smith was until 1 got to see him play every day , " says Joe McDonald , a 20-year baseball man who took over as the Cards ' general manager last year . " I think I 'm safe in saying he 's one of the best ever . " It was McDonald who , this winter , consented to pay Smith well in excess of $1 million per year for three years , the most lucrative deal ever accorded a baseball player known primarily for defensive prowess . The salary is the highest ever paid by the Cardinals , and the 18th highest in all of sports , according to a recent article in Sport magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that estimate is too modest . " I can tell you that his pay is far in excess of a million dollars . A million is not even close , " Gottlieb says . That St. Louis signed Smith to such a deal after he 'd only been with the club for one season is itself noteworthy in a game where the big bucks are typically showered upon sluggers and pitchers . But beyond its clear statement about his value to the Cardinals , an organization he greatly respects , Smith believes his contract represents a milestone of sorts in a battle of philosophies that has been fought for years within baseball and has consumed the 5 ' 10 " , 150-pound Smith since his youth . Although Smith shone at Locke High in L.A. and was convinced he had a " unique talent " and could play in the big leagues , he was ignored by baseball scouts because of his size and lack of batting clout ( the latter the only knock remaining against him ) . " People always told my son he was too small to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once told an interviewer . When Smith graduated from high school in 1972 , no baseball organization drafted him , though several slugging teammates were gobbled up . Hurt , Smith went on to college at Cal State Poly at San Luis Obispo on an academic grant , majoring in social science . He made the baseball team as a walk-on and played for four more years before being drafted and signed by San Diego in 1977 . He gave himself five years to make the majors or get out of baseball .

Ozzie Smith continued from page 65 year he was the Padres ' starting shortstop , turning seeming hits such as Burroughs ' into spectacular outs . During his rookie year he batted .258 , his highest average to date , stole 40 bases in 52 attempts and led the National League in sacrifice hits . He also demonstrated an adept range of the unsung traits  --  hitting behind the runner , taking the extra base  --  that make for winning baseball . At season 's end , many observers felt that Smith deserved to be rookie-of-the-year . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who came out of college to hit 23 home runs in 89 games , immediately attracting the attention of the sportswriters and broadcasters who shape public opinion and vote on most awards . " I had prepared myself for that , " Smith says . " I knew that baseball was that type of game . Once people realized that here 's a guy who hits home runs , it does n't matter what anybody else does . " Faced with the realization that bigger is often mistaken for better , Smith has quietly but unabashedly set out to make people aware of the intangible but vital aspects of the game he loves . It helps that in some respects he is a born athlete . His mother was a talented basketball player in Mobile , Alabama , where Ozzie was born the day after Christmas in 1954 and where he lived until 1963 . Smith does n't recall anyone ever suggesting that he play shortstop , perhaps the game 's most difficult position , or having to show him how to do it . Nor did he model himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always there , " he says . " I 've had to work continuously hard at it , but most of the things you see out there I was born with . " Yet in another , deeper sense , Ozzie Smith is a self-made man , firedby the " personal satisfaction " he says he derives from working with his hands and by his sense of mission . " It is an art to play the infield . Period . " He states this softly but firmly . As a youngster , he practiced his acrobatic skills on a sawdust pile in a lumberyard across the street from his family 's neatly kept , mustard-yellow house in the Watts district of inner-city Los Angeles . He continually improved his hand-eye coordination by throwing a ball for hour after hour against the backdoor steps . As one of five sons and a daughter deserted by their father and raised by their mother , he developed the character that enables him to apply his talents to the utmost . " 1 do n't harp on that type of thing . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " We never had a lot of money , but we made it , and that 's the important thing . " Today the refining process continues . During spring training , Smith stands at the edge of the infield dirt nearest home plate and has a coach hit him hard grounders , reaching to his backhand with the sweeping gesture of a toreador handling a charging bull , scooping up bouncing balls with elegant grace , repeating the movements in a ballet of excellence . He is , like most shortstops , practicing making his hands " soft " and flexible , attempting to quicken his reaction time . But he is also building the style , the flair for which he is known and with which he captures onlookers ' attention . Hustling all the time , avid , touched in his every movement by unmistakable athletic majesty , Ozzie Smith was an instant crowd favorite in San Diego , where his exploits were soon greeted with chants of " Oz-zie , Oz-zie , " echoes of which now sound in St. Louis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball insiders , who do not suffer pretenders lightly . Those impolitic enough to openly discuss their artfulness or brash enough to attempt flashy moves on the field had better perform well , lest they be ridiculed into submission or disMay/June ' 83 missed as idle braggarts . In his frankness , his showmanship , Ozzie Smith defies that convention , too , even going so far as to perform an acrobatic flip before the first and last games of every season , including the moment he took the field for the seventh and deciding game of the 1982 World Series . Remarkably , in baseball circles , nary a word of criticism has been voiced over such tricks  --  or any other aspect of Smith 's words or deeds . How does he get away with it ? " He 's a great team player , and he 's a tremendous influence on the ballclub , extremely well-liked , " says Cards ' general manager McDonald . " One of the corniest expressions we have is ' You 'd like to have him for your son . ' But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more applicable . " Frank Howard , New York Mets coach , managed Smith at San Diego . " Ozzie Smith is an absolute delight to have on your ballclub , " Howard says without hesitation . Cardinals teammate Tom Herr , who plays second base alongside Smith , concurs . " It 's a great thrill to be able to play with somebody like that , " he says . Herr pauses , then laughs . " I think his ability rubs off on everybody defensively , because you just want to try to be your best out there so you do n't look so bad compared to him . " Not that Smith 's impact on his teammates ends on the baseball diamond . " He 's not only good on the field , but he 's great off the field , " says teammate Willie McGee . That touch with people is not limited to Smith 's teammates . He is a ready signer of autographs , a genial interview subject . After his playing days are over , Smith intends to do as yet unspecified work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training he got in college . Meanwhile , though , retirement appears to be a long way off . Smith is just now reaching his athletic prime . He has been named to the National League All-Star team the last two seasons and won three consecutive Gold Gloves , emblematic of the best fielder at his position . He still has something to prove , too . " When I came up , I had two goals , " he says . " To win myself a Gold Glove at one time or another and to hit .300 in the big leagues , because that 's the standard that people recognize . I 've been fortunate enough to achieve my first goal three times . My next major goal is to hit .300 , and I feel that I 'm getting closer and closer to that every year . " Last season , Smith and manager Herzog had an ongoing bet . If Ozzie struck out or hit the ball up in the air , he paid $1 . If he walked or hit the ball on the ground , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , the manager paid him $1 . By year 's end Smith was some $300 richer , and Herzog says only a late-season injury to his right thigh kept Smith from posting the highest average of his career . As it was , Smith hit .248 and stole 25 bases ( his high was 57 with the Padres in 1980 ) . He also hit a personal-best 24 doubles and had two home runs  --  double his previous career high . More important , says Smith , last season he was part of a championship team , one that relied on speed , pitching and defense , a team that must now attempt a repeat performance under the glare of intensified scrutiny . With greater media attention focused on the Cardinals , the country at large will likely be treated to increased doses of Smith 's magic . And if the past is any indication of what is to come , then a love affair between America 's baseball fans and the " Wizard of Oz " is just around the corner . X '      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
