SICHUAN <P> The sight startled visitors . There , in the center of Longzhao , a prospering village on the outskirts of the city of Chengdu , were the crumbling remains of a mud-brick house , its thatched roof scattered around it like straw dandruff . The hut , obviously abandoned , was surrounded by freshly constructed brick-and-concrete apartments . The eyesore was cleared away a few weeks ago , but why had it remained so long ? " We kept it there so that people would remember what it was like five years ago , " explains Ru Furong , director of Longzhao 's garment factory . " We used it to educate the young as to how bad things used to be . " <P> Adults like Ru do not need to be educated about what life in Sichuan was like before the province became a testing lab for Deng 's agricultural reforms in the late 1970s . The country 's most populous province , Sichuan is also its rice bowl , a jade-green paradise whose fertile valleys have fed China for centuries . Yet Mao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was importing food for the first time in memory . Deng had visited his home province the previous year and had been shocked by the destitution he found . <P> Today , Sichuan is a national showplace for the policies of its homegrown boy . In a field where dozens of commune workers once listlessly toiled , a family now energetically tills the land . Villages whose fortunes once depended entirely upon crops now boast small plants that make products such as shoes , radios and billiard balls . Free markets enliven every town 's main street , attracting peddlers from all around who bring their wares by bicycle . ( What can be tied up and carried on two wheels would have amazed even Ripley : live pigs and goats and 20-ft. - long bamboo poles . ) <P> Much of the credit for Sichuan 's transformation belongs to Premier Zhao Ziyang , a Deng protg who served as the party 's provincial secretary from 1975 to 1980 . Zhao helped introduce the contract-responsibility system , the bedrock of rural reforms , in 1977 . Families and individuals were assigned plots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops could be sold to the state at higher prices . Eventually , peasants were also allowed to sell the extra grain at market . The experiment worked so well that it was adopted as a national policy in late 1978 . <P> Industrial development in Sichuan came next , spurred partly by the fact that most towns did not have enough farmland to go around . The 133 villagers in Longzhao , for example , realized they could not profitably divide the town 's meager l acres . Looking for alternatives , several women banded together to mend clothing . Today that circle has grown into a 110-woman collective housed in a new , two-story concrete building . The clatter of 60 gleaming sewing machines plays syncopated rhythm to the strains of Chinese music from the stereo and the gossipy talk of the workers . Liao Zhureng , 30 , who manages the workshop , rarely needs to exhort the women since they are paid by the piece .
