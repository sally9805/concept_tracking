TWINS Directed by Ivan Reitman ; Screenplay by William Davies , William Osborne , Timothy Harris , Herschel Weingrod <P> First thought , on looking at the billboard : nice idea ; angry , bustling little Danny DeVito and cool , self-ironical , hulking Arnold Schwarzenegger as twins . Should be funny . <P> Second thought , at the box office : hope they do n't screw it up . <P> For if recent movie history teaches anything , it is that the higher the comedy concept  --  that is to say , the simpler it is to grasp  --  the harder people seem to work at trying to lower it . If the project is one of those rare ones that have a possibility of appealing to practically everybody , the ( filmmakers are tempted to ensure that the last cipher in the least-common- denominator audience receives its message loud and clear ( especially loud ) . Hey , his six bucks ( or seven ) is as good as anyone else 's , is n't it ? <P> The good news about Twins is that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news about it : no shocking language , no pants-dropping vulgarity , no desperately paced action designed to disguise witlessness . The movie 's serene self-confidence encourages the viewer to settle back comfortably and just let it happen . And this is all the more surprising in that director Ivan Reitman ( Ghostbusters , Legal Eagles ) has in the past sometimes not known when he should leave well enough alone . <P> Obviously , Julius Benedict ( Schwarzenegger ) and Vincent Benedict ( DeVito ) are fraternal , not identical , twins . They are the spawn of a Government-funded experiment in which a carefully selected woman is artificially inseminated with a spermatozoic cocktail to which six males have each made a high-grade genetic contribution . Julius , brainy , built and , as it happens , morally impeccable , is the predictable result . Vincent is the unanticipated consequence . <P> Both babies are immediately taken from their mother , and those concerned are led to believe she did not survive the delivery . Julius is brought up in a perfectly controlled environment , where he learns everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in an orphanage , from which he escapes to become a petty and entirely unsuccessful con man on L.A. 's meaner streets . In short , neither is equipped for ordinary life , and each needs the other to become a fully functioning human being . <P> It is , of course , earnest Julius who initiates the search for his long-lost brother . But after the pair are reunited , Vincent gets the most out of their partnership : a gorgeous set of muscles to help him fend off debt collectors and a moral exemplar who finally sets him on the path of righteousness . Still , Julius does n't come off badly : he learns to drink beer , chat up girls and use a microwave . Both stars are expert at playing dumb in highly contrasting ways , and their search for their mother has its touching aspects . The whole movie has a warmth about it that never slops over into sentiment : there is much more here than tall-guy , short-guy jokes .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
