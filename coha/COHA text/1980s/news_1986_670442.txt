The experts said the figures were preliminary and were derived by applying internationally accepted radiation death rates to raw data given in a 382-page Soviet report on the April 26 accident . Soviet officials said they accepted the international standards. // The projected rates were given in a news conference at which scientists attending an international conference here did calculations , at reporters ' requests , using Soviet technical data on radiation exposures . <> <> Less Than 1% of Cancer Deaths // The experts took pains to point out that the Chernobyl-related cancer fatalities would be only a third of one percent of the 9. 5 million cancer deaths expected in the affected western part of the Soviet Union over the next 70 years. // One of the experts , Dr. Dan Beninson of Argentina , is the head of the International Commission on Radiological Protection , which recommends radiation standards to governments . The other , Dr. Morris Rosen of the United States , is the director of nuclear safety in the International Atomic Energy Agency , sponsor of the conference. // The two men said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western part of the Soviet Union , with a population of 75 million . <> <> Three Mile Island Compared // They emphasized that the 24 , 000 cancer deaths over the next 70 years would not be distributed evenly and were likely to occur especially in the republics of the Ukraine and Byelorussia and especially among the 135 , 000 people evacuated from an 18-mile zone around the Chernobyl nuclear plant . In that zone , according to the Soviet report , the average person received 12 , 000 millirems before evacuation , the equivalent of 1 , 200 chest X-rays. // This exposure was about 150 times higher than what American officials said was the maximum dose received by residents around the Three Mile Island plant in 1979 . In contrast to the Soviet disaster , the American accident did not lead to an official evacuation of the vicinity of the plant. // Dr. Rosen said some data in the Soviet report were inconsistent and would have to be ironed out in discussions . In one part of the report , for example , the Soviet figures would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature cancer deaths. // He and Dr. Beninson said that except for people in the evacuation zone , who will remain under close observation , it will be nearly impossible to prove that a specific cancer case was caused by Chernobyl ' s radiation . The death projections are based on what past experience has shown will happen for known radiation levels. // The news conference was held on the second day of a weeklong symposium on the explosion , which has so far killed 31 people and spread radiation over many countries . It was the worst such incident in the history of commercial atomic power. // In today ' s session , Soviet scientists gave new details of the response to the explosions and the fire the gutted the No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl plant , 70 miles north of Kiev . <> <> Children Are Found Healthy // The Russians said several thousand children had been under medical observation for any possible radiation effects . The children were found to be healthy and are to start the school year on Monday. // The Soviet scientists said workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow immediately after the incident began during the night from April 25 to 26 how serious it was . It was only in the morning , after Soviet officials from Moscow flew over the site , that they discovered its severity when they saw pieces from the inside of the reactor lying on the ground , the scientists said. // Dr. Rosen and Dr. Beninson , the radiation experts , also said that the explosion would produce premature cancer deaths in European nations , but that the numbers would be smaller since these countries are farther from the site . Dr. Richard Wilson , a Harvard physicist who is an expert on severe nuclear accidents , said in an interview that the maximum number of such deaths in Europe could be about 2 , 000 . But he said a more likely number would be in the hundreds. // The new projected numbers of excess cancer deaths are higher than those previously reported on the basis of less complete data ; earlier estimates generally ranged from 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 . <> <> Contaminated Food a Factor // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stem from radiation that remains on food , including vegetables that draw nourishment form the soil and fish that feed in river sediment that has been contaminated . The principal radioactive substance involved is cesium-137 , which takes about 30 years to lose half of its radioactivity. // The Soviet Union is trying to reduce these doses by having clean-up crews scrape off the topsoil in affected areas. // In addition to radiation from food , 2 , 900 people are projected as dying from external doses of radiation from the air and soil , the scientists said. // Extreme doses of radiation cause death quickly by destruction of tissues of the central nervous system , the intestines and the immune defense system . The long-term effects of low-level radiation are believed to cause deaths years after the exposure , mainly by increasing the risk of cancer in the affected population. // The Nuclear Regulatory Agency and other United States Government agencies have said that the maximum dose any member of the public might have received from the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 was 83 millirems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant from March 28 to April 7 . The plant released very small quantities of radioactive krypton . U.S. Study on Cancers A study reported in September 1985 by the Pennsylvania Public Health Department concluded that five years after the accident there had been no detectable increase in the cancer rate in the surrounding region . However , most of experts say many of the cancers would longer to develop. // According to the Federal Government , the average American receives 200 millirem per year , half of it from natural sources including cosmic radiation and naturally radioactive rocks , and half from manmade sources , primarily medical X-rays . The Environmental Protection Agency guidelines call for evacuating or sheltering people living near nuclear plants when an accident is expected to cause exposures of 1 , 000 to 5 , 000 millirems. // The 135 , 000 people evacuated from the 18-mile radius around the Chernobyl plant were the group most seriously affected , and Leonid A. Ilyin , a vice president of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences , said " we can not even think about bringing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contamination . The Soviet report indicated that it might be as long as four years before the evacuees can return . <> <> Evacuation Is Described // Dr. Ilyin described the evacuation of the 35 , 000 people of Pripyat , the town three miles from of the power plant , the day after the accident . He said people were given two hours to pack , and then 1 , 100 buses stopped off at apartment buildings to take residents away. // " It was an impressive sight , " he said. // The evacuees are being resettled elsewhere , with entire new villages being built for them. // Dr. Ilyin said children had suffered " emotional distress " and the summer spent in camp had helped to " reassure them and calm them down. " // Of the 31 people who died , which include two fire fighters killed after the explosion , a number received doses of 600 to 1 , 600 rems , the lower number being the lethal dose to almost everyone . About 50 people received more than 400 rems , the dose at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hospitalized with substantial doses , the Soviet report said. // Armen Abagyan , director of the Nuclear Power Station Institute in Moscow , said the entombment of the damaged No. 4 reactor would be finished in about a month . He said the reactor operators who stayed in the control room as the explosion developed were in good health , but " those who went toward the reactor hall to obtain a visual picture of what happened received a very high level of radiation . " " Some of them died , " he added . Temperature of Reactor Given Pierre Tanguy , nuclear safety director of Electricite de France , said in a news conference that the Russians gave signficant new information in a closed meeting today . He said the damaged top of the No. 4 reactor , on which 5 , 000 tons of limestone and other shielding substances have been dumped by helicopters , was still at a temperature of 248 degrees Fahrenheit. // He said that besides making modest improvements in safety equipment in other Chernobyl-type reactors in Soviet power stations , the Russians were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately in an emergency . Nuclear experts said the systems now in place take as much as 40 seconds to shut the reactor , but the Chernobyl No. 4 unit went out of control in less than 8 seconds as its power output surged by 100 times. // Soviet and Western experts said the Chernobyl-type graphite reactor had basic design flaws , which Western experts said make it difficult to run . But all agreed that the accident was triggered when operators shut off too many emergency systems while doing a test and the reactor got out of hand. // " This was a very good plant , " Mr. Tanguy said . " The operators got too confident . They forgot it could be dangerous. " //
