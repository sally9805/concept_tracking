At a popular new Paris restaurant down the street from the bustling French Bourse , or stock exchange , diners play a different sort of market while they eat . The price of each item on the menu rises or falls by as much as 20% according to consumer demand . An IBM personal computer at the bar continuously recalculates the prices , and a printout from the machine provides steady commentary , like the bulletins on a stock ticker : " Relance de haddock " ( Haddock on the rebound ) or " Pieds de cochon en vif recul " ( Pigs ' feet dropping fast ) . The restaurant is a hit , explains one of the owners , because it reflects the latest rage in Paris : free enterprise . <P> More than ever , the market economy has been in vogue since President Francois Mitterrand 's Socialists narrowly lost the national elections last March . Under a complex power-sharing arrangement that the French refer to as cohabitation , Mitterrand has taken the lead in foreign policy while the newly appointed conservative Premier Jacques Chirac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic Chirac wasted no time in launching a sweeping reform of the French economy , which has been slow to join the current recovery in Western Europe . <P> Starting with such measures as the removal of price controls and a reduction in taxes , the Chirac administration is trying to spur business activity by easing the constraints of government regulation . In addition , it plans to return some 50 state-controlled banks , industrial firms and other enterprises to the private sector . Said Chirac : " We must now go fast and far . France must change . " <P> To help him engineer this dramatic transformation , Chirac named his longtime friend Edouard Balladur to be the Minister of Economy , Finance and Privatization . The most powerful Finance Minister in decades , Balladur , once a top aide to the late President Georges Pompidou , has been described by the French press as Chirac 's alter ego . <P> While Chirac asked the National Assembly for the authority to begin the process of deregulation and denationalization , Balladur was already outlining other economic reforms . These steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . Balladur is confident that the program will pump new life into France 's economy . Says he : " I do n't see any more reason to hesitate to invest , to hire workers , to participate boldly in the resumption of growth and investment . " <P> The overhaul was long overdue . " The French economy we found on taking office was in a state of weakness , " says Alain Juppe , a Deputy Minister for the Budget . As evidence , Juppe points to a meager 1.1% growth rate in 1985 , an unemployment level of more than 10% ( 25% for youths under 25 ) , a trade deficit of $3 billion , and a mounting budget shortfall that is now expected to hit $20 billion for 1986 . The government hopes to solve these problems , says Juppe , with a policy based on " wisdom and economic liberty . " <P> For the French , this " liberty " represents a historic change of direction . Chirac means to free the economy from government-imposed restrictions under which it has labored for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's system of economic controls originated in the 17th century with Jean Baptiste Colbert , Louis XIV 's Finance Minister .
