Bankruptcy looms in January without fresh Government aid <P> Chrysler for the second time this year is bumper to bumper with bankruptcy . Last June the company teetered for two weeks before its 400 lenders agreed to ease financing terms so that it could obtain $1.5 billion in federally guaranteed loans . Now Chrysler is asking for $400 million in new Government-backed loans . Without them , the company may not be able to survive the month of January . <P> The immediate cause of Chrysler 's latest crisis was the reluctance of its dealers , whose lots are already packed with unsold cars , to order any more . This has forced the company to cancel plans to build some 15,000 cars in December . The dealers ' decision means that Chrysler will have $100 million less than expected in the bank on New Year 's Day . With January and February traditionally bad months in the car business , it was also apparent the company might soon be facing a negative net worth . That kind of financial slippage could block further Government aid . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . High interest rates , an initial shortage of low-cost models and the unwillingness of customers to buy cars from a company that seemed about to go out of business have cut in half projected sales of the stylish , economical K-car . Even the once popular sub-compact Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons are selling poorly , and dealers now have more than a 120-day supply , twice the desired amount . As the auto industry last week prepared for its annual holiday shutdown , only three of Chrysler 's six assembly plants were operating . The company , which had once vowed that it would earn a profit in the fourth quarter , will probably lose more than $200 million between October and December . That would push its losses for 1980 to an astonishing $1.7 billion , breaking the current record for the highest yearly loss in U.S. corporate history , set by Chrysler in 1979 with $1.1 billion . <P> During the past two weeks , Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca conceived and put together the latest rescue plan with the precision of a Swiss clockmaker piecing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's associates for another substantial financial concession to keep the company alive . The elements of the newest rescue package : <P> &gt; The auto workers ' union members are requested to accept a two-year freeze on all cost of living increases and a slight reduction in fringe benefits . This would mean that a Chrysler worker would earn $17.31 an hour in 1981 , rather than $20.45 , and $17.52 an hour in 1982 , rather than $22.11 . The concessions would be worth approximately $600 million to the company . Iacocca last week bluntly told the United Auto Workers , " It 's freeze time , boys . Chrysler 's got good jobs available at $17.30 an hour . We do n't have them at $20 . " <P> &gt;Companies that supply parts to Chrysler are being asked to delay collection of this month 's bills until January and to cut prices 5% during the first 90 days of 1981 . This would reduce Chrysler 's operating costs in that period by $90 million . <P> &gt; Chrysler Corp .
