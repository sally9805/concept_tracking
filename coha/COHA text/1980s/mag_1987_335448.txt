Ronald Reagan is getting on . Air Force One is ready for retirement . Economic summits in Venice are old hat  --  Jimmy Carter was there for one seven years ago . The dollar is tired and limp , and Paul Volcker about to become a memory . Congress is slower , windier and crankier . Even the 17-year locusts sound unhappy to have emerged again along Washington 's troubled streets . <P> Time for a change . The country feels it in its bones as summer rushes in and President Reagan rushes out . It is the seven-year presidential itch . The ebb of power is melancholy reality , the days of glory meticulously numbered . Air Force One , soon to be replaced by a grander , fancier model , sits in its hangar eager for a last run around the track . So hail and farewell , Mr. President , and good luck and fun in Europe . The fresh faces of James Madison High School in Vienna , Va. , cheer him off from the sweet sweep of the South Lawn . The creaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray clouds and is away . The Iran-contra mess seems to fade to a whisper , the deficits and the trade struggle to diminish magically . At 37,000 ft. , the world looks green and serene , even manageable . <P> Soon the President is among the faded glories of the West 's oldest free traders and the doges of Venice , with a nip down to Rome Saturday to visit Pope John Paul II and savor a few of the things that last and last and last . Then follows the embrace of his high political compatriots , the more-or-less board of directors of the consortium of major industrialized free powers , a comforting , clubby , forgiving group , every one of them scarred and battered and worried . They listen and sympathize and even laugh with one another . They are pols , one and all , a now international order that polls and prays and parades for the people . Then they pass on . <P> It is coming to an end for Ronald Reagan as it must for all Presidents , and , as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welter of charges and countercharges , scandal and disillusion . Still , Reagan is fighting , smiling . His standing with his people is edging up a bit . There will be dining and toasting and travel , a just rite of exit . But the power is palpably fading . It is being gathered up in strange little places like Greenfield , Iowa , where the latter-day populist Jesse Jackson tramps through the cornfields , and Campton , N.H. , where Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis sounds native . <P> The Gipper may yet have a rabbit or two to pull from his helmet , like a treaty with the Soviet Union to reduce intermediate-range nuclear missiles . There will be vetoes , and Reagan may still have to order the fleet here and there in the Persian Gulf , acts of institutional power . But the crusade is almost winded , the caravan dispersing . The great surges of political energy , the wide-screen visions that moved America , are headed for the memoirs . " Let 's face it , " mused one dedicated partisan about the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be interested after the first vote . " That comes in Iowa Feb. 8 , 1988 , just eight months away . The nation will gather on Main Street to judge the contenders , the world will pull up a seat to watch .
