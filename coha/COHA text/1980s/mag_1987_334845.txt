A fight that argued for fighting took place last week beside a casino in Las Vegas , a reasonable facsimile of the ends of the earth . It was not one of the greatest fights anyone had ever seen , just one of the greatest performances everyone will forever recall . A bold little man with a beatific smile , who is almost everything except a middleweight , won the championship of the world by a decision , actually a lot of them . <P> Sixty-two months between real fights , five years since retinal surgery , ; three years after his first melancholy comeback , Sugar Ray Leonard returned to boxing at 30 for the simple reason that he does it better and enjoys it more than anything else in life . Without a tune-up he challenged Marvin Hagler , an apocalyptic figure of undetermined age , unbeaten for more than a decade . Hagler warned , " If he 's foolish enough to step in the ring with me , I 'm foolish enough to rip his eye out . " Bystanders who adopted Leonard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Wilfred Benitez , Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns were a bit let down by his reappearance , and more than a little concerned . <P> In the pathetic annals of comebacks , unretiring champions from Jim Jeffries to Muhammad Ali had made sad endings appear inevitable . And the gym reports were not good . In his last showing before the fight , Leonard looked dull against Sparring Plodder Quincy Taylor , a light-heavy . But Taylor 's function had been misunderstood . He was there to drum in the virtues of gliding over brawling . " You ca n't tell Ray , " says Mike Trainer , his lawyer . " You have to show him . " <P> So everything was in place , including Trainer 's deal with Promoter Bob Arum , whose offer of a percentage was declined . Perfectly describing boxing and himself , Arum said , " I would n't trust me either . " But in a way , Trainer took all the percentages . Leonard stood to earn $11 million to $12 million , compared with Hagler 's $13 million to $14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oz. were a softer 10 ; the ring that might have been 16 ft. by 16 ft. was 20 by 20 ; and the distance was twelve rounds instead of 15 . Leonard danced into the light with tassels on his shoes . <P> The monster started out stalking and talking but flinched at the merest feint . Leonard lowered his hands , shook his head and winked . Hagler was human . For four rounds the ambidextrous champion wavered between orthodox and southpaw , while the challenger hit , held and ran . Irksomely , Leonard refused to wait in his corner for rounds to begin and paid almost no attention to closing bells . If he was the miniature Ali , then Hagler was the microcosmic George Foreman , and the pale press had forgotten Ali 's Zaire wisdom : " Black men scare white men lots more than black men scare black men . " <P> One blow in the fourth round was telling . As Leonard wound up a right-hand bolo , Hagler remembered Duran 's embarrassment and awaited a left jab . Sugar Ray punched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked insulted and came on fiercely in the fifth round . Still lunging and mostly missing , he was starting to connect at least . Not for the last time , Leonard felt the indentation of the ropes in his back . The battle seemed about to turn .
