ITALIAN FOLKTALES Selected and Retold by Italo Calvino Translated by George Martin ; Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 763 pages ; $25 <P> Once upon a time there was a writer named Italo Calvino . Although he liked making up stories , he also wanted to read older ones in his own language . " Was there an Italian equivalent of the Brothers Grimm ? " he wondered one day . No answer came . So he set out on a quest . He spent two years studying obscure texts and dusty monographs , rescuing long-forgotten tales from all the regions of his native land . Finally , he ended his labors and brought forth a magic book . <P> For Italian Folktales is assuredly that , and a classic to boot . By making these 200 stories accessible to the general reader , Calvino , 56 , has considerably enriched the world 's supply of a seriously depleted commodity , oral history . Tales passed on through the centuries by word of mouth tell much more than their plots . In their diversity , they suggest the variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their frequent similarities point teasingly in the opposite direction , toward some Ur tale that generated all the others , a narrative vast and potent enough to enclose the world . Writes Calvino : " Taken all together , they offer , in their oft-repeated and constantly varying examinations of human vicissitudes , a general explanation of life preserved in the slow ripening of rustic consciences . " <P> Until now , the best-known of these consciences ripened in central and northern Europe , thanks largely to the pioneering work of the Grimms ( in Germany ) and Alexander Afanasyev ( in Russia ) . Calvino 's collection throws open a sunny window to the south . A tale told in the Black Forest differed , apparently , from the one that was related on the shores of the Mediterranean . The three little pigs did not make it to Italy ; they became three grownup girls named Catherine , Julia and Marietta . Italian bards had little interest in the violence and gore that sometimes make for such grimm reading . When the good characters are afflicted , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dispatched at the end with commendable speed . In The Marriage of a Queen and a Bandit , a pesky ex-husband is discovered hiding in the bedroom of his former wife and her new mate : " At once the king awakened , sounded the trumpet he wore around his neck night and day , as is customary with kings , and the soldiers came running from all directions . They saw the bandit , slew him , and that was that . " <P> Instead of highlighting revenge , these stories radiate an innocent acceptance of the beauty and strangeness of life . Metamorphosis is constant ; the shapes of people , animals and things can dissolve in an instant . In The Little Shepherd , a maiden tells the hero about her life of late : " Ugly Slave threw me into the well , and I turned into a fish , then into fishbones thrown out the window . From fishbones I changed into a tree seed , next into a tree that grew and grew , and finally into firewood you cut . Now , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
