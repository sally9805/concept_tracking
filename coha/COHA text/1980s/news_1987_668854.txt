Prospective buyers touring a model home may walk into a room called a " bedroom " that has no bed , dresser or other typical furnishings . Instead , they may find office equipment , high-tech games , punching bags or other items that have nothing to do with sleeping . " There are a number of uses for an extra bedroom , " said Bob Shearman , sales manager of the Colony of Fox Valley in Naperville . The development , built by Greater Midwestern Development Inc. , offers two- and three-bedroom single-family homes priced from $79 , 000 to $108 , 000 . " Commonly , buyers will make an extra bedroom into a combination office- guest room , " Shearman said . " In one of our models a bedroom is shown as a den . The opening for the door has been expanded to six feet instead of 32 inches . " A number of people who have bought houses with a bedroom on the first floor have asked that we widen the opening into that room , " he said . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining , and it gives the house a wider , spacious feeling . The large opening can be shrunk if the owner decides to sell the house or convert the room into a bedroom . " It ' s not unusual to find a wet bar or dry bar in a room that was built as a bedroom , Shearman said . " In one model we ' ve taken the doors off a closet and put in a full-length mirror and a Formica counter top and a dry bar . " We ' ve tried to set up models to show what people could do with the home , " he said . " Some designers make a house look very nice , but it couldn ' t be lived in in that configuration . Midwestern buyers are very smart about these matters . They spend a lot of time indoors , and they ' re careful about wise utilization of space . You try to set the models up so that they offer what we would consider a well rounded use of the house . " " The trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " In the 1980s , with both adults often working , homes are becoming more private , more important as a retreat . Buyers want a home to reflect their personal taste . " Television rooms and electronics centers are becoming popular , he said . " Also , people are doubling up room uses so that an office is tucked away somewhere in there . Some are using more Scandinavian contemporay high- efficiency furniture that includes small foldaway desks , so that the office section of the room doesn ' t overwhelm the rest . " Increasing health consciousness has prompted buyers to use extra bedrooms for compact gym equipment , including stationary bicycles or rowing machines , Shearman said . " They don ' t take up that much space . And the acquisition of a few simple exercise pieces can be more efficient than going out to a health club . " John Robnett , sales manager for the single-family Brookstone subdivision in Carol Stream being developed by Town &; Country Homes , has seen a different approach to bedrooms from that at the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Glendale Lakes , where two-bedroom townhouses are priced from $78 , 900 to $94 , 900 , buyers looking at a bedroom often plan to put in a computer or a library or desk . At Brookstone three- and four-bedroom houses cost $110 , 900 to $119 , 900 . " In most Brookstone models we show how to furnish the bedroom as a bedroom , " Robnett said . " Only in our four-bedroom house have we furnished one of the bedrooms as an office or den . For most of our buyers here it ' s not a matter of using extra space creatively , but rather of finding enough space for the needs of their growing family . Our buyers are mostly couples in their 30s and 40s who have young children . They enjoy seeing different ways to furnish a bedroom , but they need those bedrooms for their kids . " In the townhouse market , however , there are exercise rooms and extra recreation rooms , " Robnett said . " One couple had video games and had set up their little room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many buyers are people in their 20s and 30s who are moving from apartments or are older people whose children have grown up and who are moving out of large houses they no longer want to maintain . " There we see people set up computers in their second bedroom , " Robnett said . " We set up a third bedroom as an open den with a volume ceiling . We took out two walls , and there was a balcony overlooking the living room . Of the 80 buyers who bought that townhouse , 78 chose the loft option rather than the third bedroom . " Another developer , Wiseman-Hughes Inc. , takes a varied approach to bedrooms that aren ' t needed for sleeping . At its Timber Ridge development in Winfield , the company removed closet doors in one of the four bedrooms in its Oakton model , priced at $125 , 000 , and outfitted the room with barbells and other athletic equipment and fixtures . In the company ' s Fields of Naperville development in Naperville , the fourth bedroom in the Berkshire , base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting room with a see-through fireplace and bookshelves . " An interior designer normally will present some ideas for a bedroom that are different from a standard bedroom , " said James Hughes Jr. , a partner and vice president of sales and marketing . " Depending on what market we want to aim for with that house , we ' ll pick up the scenario we want to go with , " Hughes said . " The number of people buying more bedrooms than they need seems to have increased in the past five years , " he said . The primary market for extra bedrooms , he said , " is someone who is self- employed or using the extra bedroom for an at-home office facility . " Both singles and two-income couples are frequent purchasers of extra rooms , he said . Also , some first-time buyers are buying extra space " with the thought of having children somewhere down the line . " I know of one working mother who is a travel agent . From her home she communicates with her office by a computer terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can set up such facilities , not lose any of the facilities of their office , and still be at home with the kids .
