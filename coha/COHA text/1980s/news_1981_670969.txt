The assumption was not so far-fetched , for Gazeta Krakowska is considered the most outspoken and courageous newspaper in Poland and has had more than one brush with the censor . The fact that a few hours ' delay in publication was almost enough to shut down the largest steel mill in the country shows how much workers value the abstract right to read relatively unfettered news. // It is perhaps a lesson not to be lost on the authorities , who have pledged to rein in the press and other mass media to try to mollify the Soviet Union . A letter from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party this month charged that the Polish news media had fallen into the hands of " the enemy " and were being used to " undermine socialism. " // The reaction to the letter has not been , for the moment at least , a 180-degree turn . Newspapers still carry accounts of events not usually covered in the Communist world and commentaries critical of the Government , although television , which responds more quickly to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of air time devoted to official ceremonies and ambassadors presenting their credentials . <> <> Journalists Urge Freer Expression // Last week the journalists ' association passed a resolution that said , in effect , that the press must continue its role of reflecting the national need for freer expression . Journalists must be responsible for what they write and must be conscious of the interests of the state , but should not abandon a critical outlook , it said. // The changes that have taken place are largely behind the scenes . Jozef Klasa , the Central Committee member in charge of press , radio and television , a liberal , resigned . He was replaced by Leslaw Tokarski , editor of the weekly magazine Perspektywy , who is a onetime protege of Stefan Olszowski , ranking hard-liner on the Politburo . The position is critical in determing how much control is exerted over editors and television producers. // The Government is also attempting to reopen negotiations on a draft bill to curb censorship that had finally taken shape after months of talks with Solidarity , the independent union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal distribution by trade unions , and the authorities now want the exemption stricken out. // The Polish press has come such a long way that it is hard to imagine it returning to a docile preoccupation with non-news . Many newspapers now feature long articles on the housing shortage , the collapse of medical facilities , corruption and profiteering by former party officials , and social problems ranging from drug addiction to homosexuality , which have been taboo for decades . <> <> Polish Ties With Soviet Are Taboo // The only articles that appear to be out of bounds for the official , or censored , press are those that raise questions about Poland ' s relationship and military alliance with the Soviet Union , and those that directly attack the principles of Marxism-Leninism . But even here the boundary is sometimes tested. // Some time ago Tygodnik Powszekny , the independent Roman Catholic newspaper , printed an attack on the management of the Polish economy that included this observation : " Whereas the crisis of capitalism is a crisis of overproduction , in a planned economy it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direct consequence of our system. " // The Polish press is now the most free in the Eastern bloc , including Yugoslavia , one Polish columnist said . But for all that , it is restrained. // One factor in the new freedom has been a flood of " independent " newspapers , estimated to number between 100 and 200 . Some of them bypass the censor , which is illegal but tolerated by a weakened state apparatus . <> <> Union Publishes Newspapers // Almost every major Solidarity office has its own publication , which may be nothing more than a mimeographed sheet appearing daily , packed with information and opinion . There are also new nationwide newspapers , including Solidarnosc , the national union ' s weekly , with a circulation of 500 , 000 , and Rzeczywistosc , or Reality , a new organ for conservatives that emphasizes nationalism , egalitarianism and Communist orthodoxy . Its circulation is 150 , 000. // Even Trybuna Ludu , the staid and rather flat national voice of the Polish United Workers ' ( Communist ) Party , has changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heretical to other countries , and it is no longer easily found on newsstands in Moscow and Prague. // One irony in the situation is that it has been the Communist Party newspapers , especially in the provinces , that have been in the forefront of change. // The unquestioned champion of the new press freedom is Gazeta Krakowska , the Communist Party newspaper of Cracow . Mr. Szumowski , a 42-year-old former television reporter and documentary film maker , and his wife , Dorotea Terkowska , a columnist , have transformed it into the most sought-after publication in Poland . <> <> Making Muckraking History // Last fall Gazeta Krakowska made muckraking history when it published investigative reports about corruption by party officials in a nearby town . The article was even cited at a party meeting , which then expelled several officials , as support for the charges against them . It was the first case in Poland of investigative reporting that led to a direct result. // During the Bydgoszcz incident last March , in which policemen beat up Solidarity activists , the paper again excelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , P.A.P. , complained bitterly that their dispatches were altered beyond recognition . Gazeta Krakowska solved the problem of official sensibilities by printing three full-length front-page articles , one giving the official version , another the union ' s side and a third with its own facts and conclusions. // Mr. Szumowski is modest and circumspect about his accomplishments . He is not a crusader or a ground breaker , he said , just a newspaperman who believes in using " good , journalistic workshop skills. " // " The party has called for a dialogue , and I treat that call seriously , " he said . " If there ' s to be a dialogue , well , let ' s have a dialogue. " // " I take the party at its word , and I treat seriously the agreements it struck with Solidarity , " he added . " There are opponents of the method of dialogue I represent - and there are people who would like to break the social accords. " // Mr. Szumowski has been fortunate in that the local Cracow party leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he becomes embroiled with the censor he calls upon the local first secretary , Krystyn Dabrowa , for support. // The trick , he found , is often in the presentation . " Take Bydgoszcz . Many journalists wrote about it accurately , but they couldn ' t get their stories printed . It ' s not enough to be courageous . You must support that with a knowledge of the political conditions . If a journalist hasn ' t learned over the past 10 years how to ski through the slalom of censorship , he won ' t be able to suddenly regain his agility. " //
