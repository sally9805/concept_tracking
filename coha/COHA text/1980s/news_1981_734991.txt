txt An agreement can save couple from costly split In the second of a series from " Living Together , " the man who brought Marvin vs . Marvin to the courts discusses how cohabitants can protect their rights and property after they break up . By Marvin Mitchelson FTER SHE HAS thrown the final plate against the wall and he has put his fist through the partition and it 's absolutely , finally , irrevocably over , what happens next ? lie packs his bag and stomps out or she jumps into the Toyota and vrooms away . Naturally , the best solution is to be able to walk away with a minimum of Living together fuss . But let 's say there 's a dispute about who owns what . " That Dylan album is mine ! " " No , the Rolling Stones is yours . Dylan is mine ! " " What does the agreement say ? " So , they dig out a written agreement that listed everything , and there it is , all detailed , neat , and precise . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite so simple and that have not been ? backed up by a specific , written agreement , which is almost invariably the case . The natural question is , Who gets what ? Generally , under the law , each one gets what he or she brought into the relationship . And if they can separate everything into things they brought with them when they first moved in together , they should be able to part friends . THE PROBLEMS , as from the dawn of history , arise with property that both might feel they own . Let 's say they put money together and bought a sofa , drapes , and a color TV . If they kept track of who paid for what and // Marvin Mitchelson : " The problems , as from the dawn of history , arise with property that both ( members of a couple ) might feel they own . " put it in writing , great . If they did not but they can agree to some sort of a division ? say , he takes the TV and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such situations , you are far better off if you can settle the division of property between yourselves . In most cases , a simple , even division is probably the easiest solution . Most ' courts would divide the property that you have accumulated together evenly . Generally , without some specific written statement , valuable property acquired separately by one other than through the normal earnings or services rendered during the relationship remains that one 's separate property . What is " theirs " is what " they purchase together , or agree to share by express or implied agreement . The need for a clear agreement // lamp ? An agreement can prevent a costly split when a ' living-together ' relationship ends ? Centhined him first Tempo page a written agreement ? arises ' more often end usually when the parties involved come into the relationship with substantial property they wish to protect . People who are high earners , who are-likely to acquire more property , had better define their intention not to divide their property should a relationship break up . If they wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claim for part or half of their property , they had better get something in writing . A suit could be predicated not upon the other party 's greedy intention of taking somebody to the cleaners but upon an honest misunderstanding ? a belief that one should be rewarded for his or her companionship and support . The person could honestly have assumed that you were going to share your life with her or him , even though that is not quite *hat you had in mind . WHAT HAPPENS under these circumstances when it is , over and somebody walks out ? Susan has been living with Rick for five years , staying home , cooking and cleaning and being a loving companion . One day Rick says , " So long , kid . I just met a chick and I 'm going to move in with her . " In this situation , jobless Susan has no means of support . She might be in poor health , ready for an emotional breakckiwn , or , similarly disadvantaged . What can Susan do ? Because she is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must try for help in the civil court or court of common pleas on the grounds that a contractual agreement of some kind exists between her and Rick , or that there is some equitable basis for relief between the former partners . Her first order of business is to get a lawyer . The simple truth is that for a woman without funds , it is difficult to get a lawyer to handle a cohabitation case , although an attorney might handle her case on a contingency basis in states where it is acceptable . Once the lawyer is retained , he will first have to determine how the laws of that particular state apply . If the state has adopted the Marvin principles in whole or in part , such as in New Jersey , for example , the lawyer prob ably would try to determine if there was a written contract , or if there was an oral or hit-plied agreement . If not , and he still believed the circumstances were favorable enough , he could proceed with the object of recovering under some equitable remedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain some kind of temporary support tor the womad . Although difficult to obtain , it can be done . THE FASTEST method of proceeding in civil court is by way of a show cause order and a . temporary restraining order . This is a legal procedure to bring another party into court promptly within a matter of days and a way of freezing things as they are until the matter can be , brought before a judge . One lawyer friend obtained an order directing the defendant ( male ) to show cause why he should not be prevented from halting support to the woman client . He also obtained a temporary restraining order directing the defendant not to halt support and not to sell the house in which his client was residing . However , the show cause and temporary  --  restraining orders ? will only maintain the status quo ; they will not bring about support payments when there were none before . There must be a showing that the party seeking help will be irrevocably harmed if the order is not granted . Another - way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently solid written contract might be for the moving party 's lawyer to make a motion for a summary judgment , one entered by a judge without a trial where it can-be shown that there is no arguable issue . If there are no disputed issues of fact , the motion may be granted and a final judgment quickly obtained . But it should be pointed out that if any kind of factual dispute is raised , Rich as fraud , undue influence , or mistake , the ease must be heard on its merits and the summary motion judgment will be denied . ? AM I SAYING that fighting a cohabitation suit is very difficult and time-consuming ? Yes ! If you can settle such a dispute between yourselves , with lawyers to advise you , of course , you should do so . You not only save ? additional attorneys ' fees and court costs , you save the anguish of a long , dry waiting spell and an uncertain result . On the other hand , am I saying that because of the time and expense involved it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an equally loud and clear , No ! If it is a matter of conscience and real property rights are involved , the quest for justice should be pursued . A live-in contemplating such an action must also keep in mind that a statute of limitations controls such cases . Normally an oral contract has a two-year limitation period . In other words , a suit for breach of contract must be filed within a designated period after the breakup . From " Wino Together , ? copyright 0 19 by Kevin Mildselson. 1111 .
