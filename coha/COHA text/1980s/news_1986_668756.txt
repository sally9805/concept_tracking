Some public issues transcend the tangled set of pragmatic considerations by which we manage our way through ordinary social conflicts . The future of the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute and the Institute for Juvenile Research was one of these issues . Before Gov . James Thompson reversed the decision Thursday , state budget cuts would have slashed 34 percent of the institute ' s funds , rendering uncertain its continuing operation as a top-flight source of mental health training and treatment . The Institute for Juvenile Research , rich in esteem and achievement , would have gone quietly into that bad night of extinction . It is difficult to imagine moves that could have been more self-defeating for any enlightened contemporary community . It does not do to assail Gov . Thompson alone , transforming him into a midsummer Scrooge who turns patients out of their beds . As a matter of fact , in cutting mental health funds , the governor followed a well-established precedent that we the people have passively endorsed in a variety of settings for many years . Because we have hardly protested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves against the very items so recently threatened : mental health service , training and research . Examine other municipalities and businesses ; inspect the ledger pages at great universities or the reimbursements allowed by health plans . Mental health and research are led , like unwanted royal wives without advocates , to the chopping block before all others . These areas , administrators have learned , can be reduced without occasioning excessive protests or political fallout . Those who suffer mental illness constitute a largely voiceless and inarticulate constituency . They have never attracted as much sympathy or understanding as those afflicted with more dramatic kinds of disease or accident . And those experts who understand , minister to or explore the origins of their distress are relatively few in number . They have had constant difficulties in translating the meaning and nature of mental illness to the public at large . It does not rank imaginatively with the immediately life-threatening diseases , and direct links , such as those suggested between various forms of pollution and cancer , are hard to establish . The mentally ill , paralleling their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded from our consciousness ; they are at the blurred edges of our attention , somebody else ' s troubles . Despite the fact that we love the favorable application of medical research to our own lives and that we have grown accustomed to the present benefits of past research on such diseases as cancer and cardiac illness , we seem willing to let efforts to lift the darkness away from mental problems lapse altogether . Indeed , by permitting the Institute for Juvenile Research to close for lack of funding , state authorities would have been following another familiar American path . It was first trod by Richard M. Nixon when he ordered reductions in support for graduate education and has been pursued by every president since then because it seems immediately to affect so few people and because its real costs , in terms of professionals unavailable in the future to do either treatment or research , are wraith-like absences rather than glowering , vote-powerful presences . In any case , we have agreed to this set of priorities , and , if we have not yet faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we should at least accept responsibility for them . Perhaps we have seemed to assent to these shortsighted programs because we have not inspected the present costs of mental illness in America . Figures from the National Institute of Mental Health reveal that the direct care costs for mental illness in this country are $36 billion . The 1987 budget for this same National Institute of Mental Health is less than the $200 million the Senate recently considered a minimal and ineffective amount of aid for Nicaragua ' s contras . Of federal research dollars spent per patient , $130 went for heart disease , $10 , 000 for muscular dystrophy and $14 went for schizophrenia even though 40 percent of all long-term hospital beds in the country are occupied by persons suffering from that illness . And despite the fact that there has been considerable national soul-searching about the tragedy of 16 , 000 adolescent suicides every year , only $10 per patient goes into research on the depression so often associated with taking one ' s life . Other estimates suggest that we are now spending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS . The now-rescinded budget cuts probably would have pushed the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute backward in time , forcing it to use techniques of treatment , such as increased use of restraints , that it had hoped were largely historical memories . The cuts would have sentenced a well recognized center of learning and training to mediocrity . If we would be displeased to observe physicians return to bleeding their patients with leeches to treat their strokes , we should hesitate to acquiesce in such drastic monetary surgery . To turn out a researcher as distinguished , for example , as Dr. John Davis , is to strip the city and the state of a major clinical asset . Perhaps we should recall the way we have all profited from basic research into the alleviation of emotional illness . It is estimated , for example , that over the last 15 years , the use of lithium , effective in 85 percent of manic-depressive disorders treated , has saved the country $6. 5 billion in medical bills . There is no way one can express the lessening of human misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring these budget cuts , or at least setting up some temporary coalition for studying the problem and finding alternate solutions , was pressing indeed . Chicagoans , like other metropolitan area residents , may well think about these matters as they pass through their own streets , for they tingle invisibly with the dread of emotions barely suppressed , of hostility just beneath the surface of everyday life . One of the signs of our times is the anger in the air all around us . It can be experienced casually , in the threats and obscene gestures stimulated by the least crossing of another ' s path . It is raised to another power of terror in the daily reports of the crimes that flow from impulse lives that are out of control : The killings , rapings , child abuse , muggings , and blind but symbolic property damage all around us . We might well meditate on ways to safeguard these hope-filled institutions the next time we see a street person , hardly comical or romantic in reality , wander past us from one emptiness to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our necks . That is reason enough for ordinary citizens to express themselves positively in support of maintaining excellence at the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute and the Institute for Juvenile Research.
