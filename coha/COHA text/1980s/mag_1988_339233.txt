Perhaps it was Mexico City 's high altitude that produced such rarefied records , three of them , at the 1968 Games : Bob Beamon 's 29-ft. 2 1/2-in. long jump , Lee Evans ' 43.86-sec. 400 meters and the U.S. 's 2:56.16 in the 4 X 400- meter relay . They are still three of track and field 's greatest achievements . <P> But this Olympic year one has fallen at last , and the thers could be in jeopardy . Last month American Harry ( " Butch " ) Reynolds ran a blitzing 43.29 400 in Zurich to break Evans ' mark . He will try to better that in Seoul . And he figure 3/4s to anchor a strong 4 X 400 relay team that experts think could have a chance at the 1968 mark . Then , says Reynolds , 24 , his goal after the Games is to meet his hero Evans , who is coaching sprinters in Cameroon . <P> Beamon 's record will be the toughest to overtake . The jump was almost surreal . In the 33 years since Jesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had increased only 8 1/2 in . In one leap , Beamon raised it by nearly 2 ft . Since then , Carl Lewis has jumped over 28 ft. 22 times without a disqualifying trailing wind . Only eight other legal 28-ft. jumps have been recorded . Lewis ' best is 4 1/4 in. short of Beamon 's . Although he has won 55 consecutive long- jump competitions , Lewis is also well remembered for passing his last four jumps at the ' 84 Games , when the gold medal was his but the record was n't . " The event that means the most to me is the long jump , " says Lewis . " I was never really aiming for the record . That was just a media thing . I 'm still aiming to improve . I would like to hit 29 ft. and go from there . " From there , it is still precisely 2 1/2 in. farther .
