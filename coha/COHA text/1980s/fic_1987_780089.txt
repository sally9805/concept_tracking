 | gratefully accepted the excuse to rest . Her short brown hair was plastered to her forehead with sweat , and her freckled cheeks were flushed . Six miles , downhill , and Sylvia was tiring . In the last hour she 'd found a dozen reasons to stop . Stones in her walking shoes . Burs inside her blouse . Cadman ' ) chuckled inwardly . The Colony 's biologist was tough , and as stubborn about admitting fatigue as he . She 's also three months pregnant . Won ' t admit there are real differences between the sexes . So be it . Ernst loped down the slope . A brace of the large silver fishlike creatures the Colony had dubbed " samlon " slapped against his muscular back . His grin split his broad face from ear to jug ear . " Tiring out , Sylvia ! You ought to work out ! Exercise ! I can show you . " Sylvia laughed . " Not right now , thanks , Ernst . " " Later . " Poor bastard . Ernst Cohen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brighter than hell . You could watch it at cocktail parties : everyone else talking , and suddenly Ernst would say maybe two sentences , and half the room would go silent as the rest of them digested the implications . That was ten lightyears ago . Ernst had come out of frozen sleep with the mind of a child . Sylvia scanned the valley , gave a sigh of pleasure . " Terrific shot , is n't it ? " Cadmann 's voice , ordinarily a hoarse rumbling sound , was quietly thoughtful . " National Geographic will love it . " He squatted next to her . " Are you all right ? " " Just fine , " she murmured . She turned , warming him with her smile . " But I 'll be happy to get back home . " She was almost twenty years younger than he . Sylvia was all quick wit and golden eyes that glowed with life above a galaxy of freckles . Her pregnancy changed nothing . It was wonderful , it was frustrating : being with her made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes . She 's plain except for the eyes . God help me . The pass they traversed was at the base of the tallest mountain on the island . The highest of its double peaks was just above thirty-two hundred meters . Both were shrouded with mist . The delicate bat shapes of the pterodons glided in and out of the cloud cover with barely a flutter of their membranous wings . Ernst stared up at them , his face a mask of puzzled concentration . What would Dr. Ernst Cohen have made of them ? They are n't really pterodons . There are other oddities . He 'd have loved it here ?  | " They woke him twice , " Sylvia said . " Maybe if they 'd just left him cold ? " " We did need him . We did , " Cadmann said . But Ernst was n't crew . He could have slept through , but they had a problem with one bank of frozen embryos and woke him , and he 'd solved that , and they 'd chilled him again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man as ever lived follows me around to carry samples . Son of a bitch A square kilometer of plastic-coated solar cells glittered silver on the hills above the Colony . Today 's sunshine meant independence from the fission power plants of the landers . An actual fusion plant would be constructed within the next four months . Then the Colony would be fully established , and the spread of man across the face of Tau Ceti Four could really begin . ? Across Camelot , anyway . Eighty kilometers of stormy ocean separated the island from the mainland . A New Guinea-sized island was quite ambitious enough for humankind 's first interstellar colony . Zack had known what he was doing . Isolate the problems . . . . So where were the problems ? " Snow up there , " Cadmann said , shading his eyes as he gazed up into the eternal clouds at the top . Skis . We did n't bring skis . We have plastics . Carlos can make me a pair of skis . Sylvia handed him back his camera . Voice carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the continent , Cadmann . There 's plenty for you to do around the camp . " " Nothing that any other able body could n't do . " " You 're not a geologist . You 'd be doing grunt work anyway . " She looked down at him , sighed in exasperation and gave him her hand for balance as he stood . " Do you just want to go hunting dinosaurs ? " " Sure ! What boy does n't want to bag a brontosaurus ? " He slipped the camera back into its holster at his side . " Sometimes I wish we 'd brought fetuses for a kodiak , or a few mountain lions . . . . " He was smiling as he said it , but Sylvia wondered . Cadmann brushed his hand through thick black hair . There was no gray in it , but his face was sun-cured leather . His body was as young as a daily hour of intensive exercise could make it . He could remember when he had n't needed regular exercise to maintain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-two , he was seriously considering nudging that up to an hour and a half . I 'm slowing down , he thought . She 's carrying another man 's baby , and I 'd rather be with her than . . . Mary Ann Eisenhower ? He thought of four or five women who had made their  | intentions clear . Phyllis McAndrews . Jean Patterson , willowy blond agronomist rumored to give the best massage on the planet . He just was n't interested . Time wounds all heels . The glands must be drying up . Sylvia grinned back . " Only real gentlemen refuse to notice when a lady is slowing them down . " Ernst stood carefully out of earshot . His intelligence was gone , but not his manners . She jerked her thumb at the pair of freshly caught silver-and-black torpedo shapes hanging over Ernst 's back . Fifteen and twenty pounds , at a guess . One still gaped ; the gills still fluttered , too far back on its body . . . they did n't look that much like earthly salmon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell you what . I 'll fix dinner tonight . Everybody to the beach for a samlon roast . " She linked her arm with Cadmann 's as they marched down the side of the hill . He grinned maliciously . " Are you sure Terry wo n't mind that ? " " Oh , come now . I 'm just a poor pregnant lady biologist who appreciates the presence of a strong man  --  and Terry 's known you for years . " " I may not be as safe as you think . " She snorted . " Fat chance . When I 'm sure you want my body and not my mind , I 'll faint . " He looked at her appraisingly . " Which way will you fall ? " " Hush . " They laughed . The sun shone more brightly than usual . " Golden fields . Silver rivers . " Cadmann laughed . " I suppose . I see a year-round water supply and fertile croplands . " " You would . " Somebody 'd better . The stream flowed past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest body of running water on the island . Eight kilometers to the south the grasslands ended in a burnt , blackened semicircle of firebreak and beyond that the crest of giant brambles began . The colonists had chosen a beautiful place to start a new world , lovely enough to make him feel . . . almost at peace . Times like this confused him . It was a fight not to shut down his thoughts and find some project totally involving , and preferably a little risky . Slender fingers dug into his arm . " Hey , big guy . Do n't go brooding on me . This was supposed to be our walk day . Stay with me for a while , hmm ? " He was still quiet . " Tau Ceti Four . Avalon . " She rolled the words over her tongue .  | " It 's a good name . " " But ? " " Do n't know . " " Not poetic enough ? " He helped her over a rock . It took effort to focus on the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read poetry ? " " Kipling . " She laughed . " It 's all right . I know you 're better read than me . And I 'll keep your secret . I do n't know , Avalon 's all right . But there are others . Beautiful , exciting places from history , or legend . Shangri-la , Babylon ... " " Xanadu ? " " Sure . Pellinore . " He shook his head . " You must mean Pellucidar . Pellinore was a king . One of Arthur 's Knights of the Round Table . " " Well . . . maybe so . But I do n't mean Pellucidar , either . There are n't really any predators on the island . Except for the turkeys and other critters we 've seeded , there just is n't a damn thing bigger than an insect . Even the plant life . Low grass and thorn trees . It 's like a blank slate . Or a park . Cadmann ? " He asked , " Does that bother you ? " " Well , the worst we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like we 'd turned all those Earth creatures loose on the mainland . " " I meant too perfect . Why do you care ? " " Well ? " Ernst ran up , pointing . " Birds . Big Birds . " Two of the fan-winged shapes swooped past . Cadmann watched as they circled out over the plain , then vanished in the mist that reached halfway down the face of Mucking Great Mountain . " Nest there ? " Ernst asked . " Why there ? " He frowned again . " See ? We do have company . " " The pterodons ? They 're way more frightened of us than we are of them . And the biggest of them is hardly strong enough to carry off a good-sized samlon , let alone a sheep . " " How about a baby ? " he asked . She took it seriously . " I do n't think so . To tell you the truth , I have n't seen anything much bigger than a sea gull , and that bothers me . The ecology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you 've got is small insects and these big local fish . " " The samlon . " " Of course they are n't really fish . What with the trout and the  | catfish and the turkeys , we 've added more animals than we found . Spooky . " Sylvia turned thoughtful as they picked their way down a steep slope . " You know , there 's something funny about the pterodons . " " What 's that ? " " Well , remember the one we saw hunting samlon in the pool ? " " Sure . Reminded me of albatross in the South Pacific . " Sailing aboard Ariadne with a fair wind north , a million years  --  no , not a million years , but a lot more than a million miles ago . With luck we 'll build schooners here before I 'm dead . " Did n't that look funny to you ? I ca n't quite put my finger on it , but it reminded me of an old Walt Disney nature film , with the action run in reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A bird hits the water hard and fast , makes its grab , then takes off at its leisure . That bird hit the water slow and took off fast , almost as if ... " She frowned , shaking her head like someone trying to rattle cobwebs off a thought . " Never mind , I 'm trying to force something . " " Or see something that is n't there . You 'd love to put some mystery into this system . " " How 'd you get to know me so well ? " " I always understand other men 's women . " " Ah . " Without warning Cadmann began to run , pulling Sylvia down the last twenty meters of slope . She skidded on her heels to slow herself , nonplused but exhilarated by his sudden burst of energy . He glanced back and realized that Ernst was running too . Ernst looked frightened . " Hold up , " Cadmann said . He called , " Ernst ! It 's okay , Ernst . We 're just running for fun . Want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run slowed . " Race . Sure , Cadmann . Start even ? " They lined up , gave Sylvia a hundred meters of head start , and ran . Even this far out from the camp , there was a blackened strip of road for them to follow . It was brittle and glassy . " Your road , " Ernst shouted . " Yours . " " Sure . " It was . The last time they really needed me . Ernst led with the weed burner , a converted military flame thrower . Cadmann had driven the bulldozer , wishing all along that there had been enough fuel to use a landing craft . That would have made a road ! Hover across the ground on the Minerva , fuse the rock forever ? Even so , he felt pride when he scanned the kilometers of dark ribbon he had created with his  | own sweat and skill . He bent to look closer at the surface of the road . A few tiny bluish sprigs were nosing their way out of the ground . Sylvia came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt before you make your next pass . " " I 'm not even sure it matters . Not much of the heavy machinery comes out this far . " Thin clouds of dust raised by the tractors puffed like tiny fires in the distant fields . The crops had been established . Now they must be expanded . Prepare the ground for new crop tests , lay away grain and seeds against the possibility of a bad year . The Colony was a success . Zack Moscowitz  --  administrator , allaround good guy , everybody loves Zack  --  Zack had done it . The Colony was a success , and nothing short of disaster could stop its expansion across the island and eventually over all of Tau Ceti Four . Agriculture . Food , vitamins , some comforts . We have those , and now comes prospecting . Iron ore had been discovered on the island itself , and the orbiting laboratory had found what looked very much like a deposit of pitchblende . It was deep in the interior of the continent , across thousands of kilometers of ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uranium . The foundations of empire . " The sons of Martha . " " Eh ? " Sylvia giggled . " Kipling . Sorry . Politicians are the sons of Mary . Then there are the others , the ones who keep civilization going . They do not preach that their God will rouse them a little before the nuts work loose ? ' Oh , never mind . " Today seemed more tolerable , more like the First Days , when Cadmann and Sylvia and the other First Ones thundered down from the heavens in their winged landing craft . All the gliding characteristics of a brick . We left a line of fire and thunder that circled the sky . A hundred and fifty colonists waited in orbit , cold as corpses and no more active , while we scanned a strange planet from end to end , and chose the place to set our city , and set our feet in the rock of this world . The National Geographic Society 's probes told a lot . Tau Ceti Four had oxygen and water and nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperate zones were smaller , but a lot of the planet was livable . They 'd known there would be plants , and guessed at animals . Humans could live there  --  or could they ? Probably , but the only certainty would come when people tried it . Civilization on Earth was rich , comfortable , satisfying ; and  | crowded , and dull . Forty million university graduates had volunteered for the expedition . The first winnowing had eliminated compulsive volunteers , flakes whose horoscopes had told them to find a different sky , candidates with allergies or other handicaps , geniuses who could n't tolerate cramped conditions or human company or people who gave orders . . . . Perhaps a hundred thousand had been seriously considered ; and two hundred had set forth to conquer Tau Ceti Four . Eight had died along the way . No world would ever be tamed by robots . It took men , crossing space , some awake , some chilled , a hundred years across space ? The early days were good days . We were comrades in an untamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need me at all . They need Sylvia . They need the engineers , and the tractor drivers , and , God help us , the administrators and bean counters , but never a soldier . Sheep and calves roamed the pastures now . Colts grazed . Soon the camp would be full of children , alive with their happy wet smells and sounds ; and what need had those for Colonel Cadmann Weyland , United Nations Peacekeeping Force ( Ret . ) ? Animals . . . a distant lowing snapped Cadmann out of his reverie . They were nearing the rows of moist , furrowed earth . Other crews had burnt the ground , spitting jellied fuel from backpack flame throwers to clear the soil of underbrush without glazing it into slag . The charred dirt had long since been plowed under to prepare for seeding . The ground was very fertile , needing only minor nitrate supplementation to provide a healthy medium for their crops . In the distance one of the farmers slowed his tractor to wave to them , and Ernst lifted two samlon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colts and calves , still far too young to manage the plows that would be fashioned for them . It was an unusual combination  --  a meld of high technology and muscle-intensive agriculture . In an emergency , the Colony could fall back on the most ancient and reliable means of production . There were rows of wheat and spinach and soybeans , and in the mist-filtered glare of Tau Ceti their leaves and stalks glistened healthily . At the base of the rows ran the irrigation ditches , fed by the stream that passed under the low bridge just ahead , flowing past the camp and over the edge of the bluff to join the Miskatonic River . The sounds of the main camp drifted to them . The hum of light machinery , the crackle of laughter and the whining burr of saws and lathes working wood and metal .  | The animal pens were on the outskirts of the main camp . Dogs and pigs had their own pens , the horses a well-fenced running space . The chickens were cooped near the machine shop , closer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire surrounding the pens . His face tautened into a frown . Their " hot wire " was n't even warm ; the power had been switched off months before . The barbed wire beyond that was down in three places that he could see . He scraped at a brownish patch of rust with his thumbnail . " Let it go , " Sylvia chided . " Look at this . " His voice was flat with disgust . " The strands are slack , and the power line is broken . Does n't anybody give a damn anymore ? We have n't been here long enough to get this lazy . " " Cad ? " Sylvia 's pale slender fingers covered his , prying them away from the strand . She gripped his hand tightly . " Look , I know I keep getting outvoted , and I can live with that . " He was mortified to hear the petulance creeping into his voice , to see the maternal concern softening her eyes . " Listen . You keep telling me that there are things about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot at this . Nobody 's going home , and no one 's sending any reinforcements . It only makes sense to be a little paranoid . That 's why we picked an island , is n't it ? To localize the dangers ? " She squeezed his arm . " I ca n't change your mind , so I 'll try not to want to . Listen . Why make a big thing about it ? Why not just fix the fence yourself ? " " Sounds good . " " Good . I 'll send for you when we 're ready for the barbecue . " Just before they took the last turn into town , Cadmann looked back at the farmers and felt a brief pang of jealousy . They , in wresting victory from the soil , were the true hunters , the true warriors . Ultimately their efforts would determine the future of the fledgling community . The sun was warm , but far warmer was Sylvia 's hand against his arm . THE COMMUNITY had grown in a strangely organic manner ; the first crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close together within the defensive perimeter . Perimeters . Three rings . Electric fence , mine field , barbed wire . It made sense at the time . Cadmann ' s folly .  | And one of these days they 'll make me go dig up the mines . No enemies . No dangers . Nothing . And all that fucking work to build fences . Most of the colonists had only been awake for eight months , and already they were beginning to get sloppy . As they had been awakened and shuttled down , the camp expanded , filling the defensive compound , then spreading outside it . From above , the Colony looked like a spiral nebula or a conch shell sliced sideways . Cadmann 's home was at the center . The colonists outside the fence had more room , larger lots  --  but their location showed their status . Colonists . They were not among the First Ones . Everyone on Avalon was equal , but some were more equal than others . The First Ones had landed four months earlier and had social status  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building needless fences and mine fields had status . The muffled whirr of a power saw grew louder , and the dry smell of sawdust more distinct , as Cadmann wove his way through the narrow streets that divided off the flat-roofed houses and foam-sprayed prestructured domes . Some of the domes had been left in their original tan . Others were painted , some with a kaleidoscope of colors . Here and there were strikingly realistic murals . We have a lot of talent here . All kinds . Speaking of which ? The saw changed pitch as Carlos Martinez spotted Cadmann and lifted a hand in greeting . Carlos 's dark , lean body glistened with perspiration as he glided the saw over the planks . The thorn trees at the perimeter of the clearing provided a generous supply of wood , but it was knotty and coarsely grained . Only a master craftsman like Carlos could have made anything but firewood of it , and the carpenter was deliciously aware of his valued position . Half the Colony 's dwellings had a table or bed frame by Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take his rotation in the field to earn his share of the crop . " Cadmann ! Mi amigo . " Carlos wiped his brow and extended a sweaty palm that Cadmann shook firmly . Carios was a true mongrel , and gloried in it . Originally from Argentina , his bloodline was predominately black , his cultural leanings anyone 's guess . His Spanish was atrocious , but he interjected it into his conversation regardless . " I heard that you had gone off with the lovely Senorita Faulkner . " " Senora , " Cadmann corrected . He moved in for a closer look at the woodwork on the bench . It was the beginnings of a headboard for  | Carlos 's bed , and already penciled on it were mermaids cavorting in improbable couplings with virile mermen and grinning sailors . He sighed . " Senora . " Carlos smiled mischievously . " It is true that sometimes I forget . " " It 'll get easier to remember . " He patted his stomach . " She 's got a passenger on board now . " Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking on good flesh , no ? My people , we appreciate a ? " he screwed up his mouth in a dramatic search for the right word ? " a substantial woman . " " Substantial . " " Si ! A helpmate in the fields , a comfort by the fireside . Ah , the days of old ... " " Cut the crap , " Cadmann said without heat . " Your family never got closer to the fields than the handle of a whip . They 've had silk on their backs and diplomas in their pockets for six generations . At least . " He turned and worked the latch of his own foam-frame igloo . Behind him Carlos sighed . " With men like you , who can wonder that romance is dying in the world ? " The rest of his monologue was drowned out as the saw revved up again . Cadmann groped out to find the curtain cord and drew it to let in a spray of sunshine . It might be a month before Tau Ceti Four saw such a bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun was already low in the sky . Preparations for the barbecue would begin when twilight fell . The colonists who were working the day shift would put aside their farming and building and repair work and gather on the beach for good food and good fellowship . He wanted to grab his toolbox and go out to the fence , but his solitary bed , nestled beneath a sheltering bough of drip-dried underwear , called to him in a voice that his suddenly heavy muscles could n't ignore . I 'll just sit for a moment , he told himself . The water mattress sloshed pleasantly under his buttocks as he settled his weight into it . He rarely noticed until he was tired , but Avalon 's gravity put an extra ten pounds on him every second of his life . The waning sunlight cast deep shadows in the room , here and there glinting on the shelves and boxes that held the last remnants of another life . Everything he had been was in this room . The hundred and sixty people who made up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends . It was n't much , but it was enough . Enough , because the behavior- ists and sociologists and colony planners said it was enough . Because they , in their infinite wisdom , had calculated exactly how many pressed flower petals and class-album videodisks were required to stave off depression : just enough to stimulate the fond memories , not enough to create an incurable homesickness . His world . The silver-gilt college trophies , reminders of victories in Debate and Track and Wrestling , were holograms . Hologram images of smiling women whose warm lips and smooth bodies left frustratingly little impression on his memory . How long had they been dead ? Thirty years ? Forty ? They 'd been planning another colony even before Geographic launched . A statuesque New Yorker named Heidi had talked about riding the next starship to build a colony at Epsilon Eridani . Maybe she had . It would have launched twenty years after Geographic . She might even now be wondering which of her old beaus was still alive . There were disks of favorite movies  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp library . There , a shifting hologram of his command post in Central Africa . A peacekeeping force , nothing more , until the revolutions . " Sergeant Major Mvubil We 're moving out ! " " Sir ! " We were needed . Then . His clothing was all nonsynthetics that might take a generation to replace . How long would it be until they thawed out the silkworms and the mulberry bushes for them to feed on ? Not exactly a high priority item ... He did n't remember closing his eyes , but when he opened them he was lying down , and the sun had set . Cadmann grabbed his toolbox and a folding stool and hustled from the room . Getting old is one thing , dammit ! Senility will just have to wait .  | A JEEP roared by , full of colonists who were full of beer . " Grab some wheels and we 'll race you to the beach ! " Cadmann waved and pointed to his toolbox . They razzed him and careened out of the compound , singing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers changed shifts . The party atmosphere was infectious . Avalon 's inadequate twin moons would smile on a beachful of frolicking spacefarers . The folding stool 's seat was several centimeters too small , but as he bent to the task of repairing and refastening the wire , he forgot the discomfort . Avalon 's moons cast double , divergent shadows with their bluish glow , and the stars were brilliantly sharp and clear . No crickets . And along about evening the nightbirds are n't beginning to call because the things they use for birds here do n't sing . And maybe we 'll fix that , with bluebirds and mockingbirds if the goddam ecology people want them . I wonder if they brought crickets ?  | Cadmann unwound two meters of wire and scraped at the clotted dust surrounding the loose connection , then clipped the old wire free and attached the new . He fired the soldering torch . Do they still stand retreat at the Academy ? Cadets in archaic uniforms standing in rigid rows , plebes telling jokes in hopes of making upperclassmen laugh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bands , the Anthem , the flag lowered slowly to the beat of drums . . . . He attached the leads from the voltmeter . The needle jumped into the red . Done . Mist had rolled in from the sea . The stars were gone ; the moons were wavery blobs . Cadmann felt pinpricks of moisture on his face . A calf on the far side of the wire grunted longingly and shuffled over , looking at him with huge , liquid eyes . Cadmann reached through and petted it , and it licked his hand . " No mother , eh , girl ? Must be tough not to have a mommy cow to love you . " Its tongue was rough and warm , and it moved more urgently now as it tried to suckle at his hand . Cadmann laughed and pulled his fingers away . The calf shivered . " Aw , come now , you ca n't suckle my fingers .... " Then he saw fear in the calf 's eyes . Its head jerked to and fro , then stopped abruptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved toward him . They stood together in clumps . A filly whinnied with fear , and Cadmann came to his feet . " What 's bothering you , girl ? " The feeding stalls were enclosed by the electric fences and narrow walkways . Cadmann carefully stowed the tools and went into the compound . What 's bothering them ? The filly was to his right . Instead of trotting over to him she bucked . Cadmann opened the gate to her pen . " Heidi . Here , girl . " She moved warily . " Here . " He ruffled her mane . " Shhh . Heidi , Heidi , " he crooned . " Quiet , girl . " Night came suddenly . Both moons were at half stage : bright enough , but they left pools of dark shadows through the barnyard , some of them back by the dog pen . There were ten young German shepherds in the pen , and their ears were flattened against their heads . They growled deep in their throats , teeth bared in the moonlight . " Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell is out there ? " There was nothing , in the pens or beyond in the deep shadows leading to the bluff . The sound of the panicked animals was a rattling cacophony . Cadmann stood still and listened . Nothing . Carefully he took out the Walther Model Seven pistol and checked the loads . Silly . Nothing here .  | If Moscowitz sees me with this he 'll take my pistol away . He slipped off the safety , then put it in his pocket and left his hand there . What in the hell was going on ? He looked back at the animal pens . The German shepherds , dogs bred for their loyalty and intelligence , were going berserk . The wildest of them was also the eldest , a nearly fullsized bitch who was actually biting at the electrified fence , touching it and recoiling , returning again and again . Cadmann ran to the pen 's gate and gave a low whistle . " Sheena . Come , girl . What 's out there ? What is it ? " She came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed and staring out into the darkness . He opened the gate , careful of the other dogs . " Back . Come , Sheena . " He left the gate open long enough for Sheena to get out , then grabbed the fur at the scruff of her neck when she tried to run ahead . These dogs need training . It 's time . She growled low in her throat . The others barked furiously . Sheena strained ahead . All the animals were yowling now . Darkened windows behind him filled with light . " What son of a bitch is screwing with those dogs ? " " Zee virgin , she is mine ! " Another light blinked on . A male voice bellowed , " Hey , you ! I just got to sleep . Will you for Christ 's ? ? Oh . Cadmann . Cadmann , a lot of us are on the night shift . Can you wrap that up fast ? " " Sure , Neal . Sorry . " The window slammed . The dog strained at his hold on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his heels . Never go out at dusk without a flashlight . Rule One . And I forgot . " Cadmann ! " Cadmann jumped . Sheena strained just at that moment , and his grip slipped . The shepherd sped baying into the dark . " Good going , Weyland . " Bloody idiot . Cadmann recognized the angry whine , had trouble matching the thin , almost effeminate frame of its owner with the label Terry Faulkner : . Sylvia 's husband . " She 'll be back as soon as she 's hungry . " " Eh ? " " Sheena . " " Oh . The dog . Yeah , I hope so . Listen , Sylvia sent me to get you . If you want to come to the beach party , get moving . We 've got the last jeep and we 're leaving now . "  | " Yeah , well . . . " There was nothing out there now , no sound but rushing water . Screw the picnic . I need a flashlight " Are you coming ? " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm leaving . " Terry 's thin lips twitched with a nervous tick that made it hard for Cadmann to look him directly in the face . His small fists balled up and set on his hips . " Sylvia said you should come . " Did you ever recover from puberty ? What if I throw you in the creek ? The dogs were quiet now . Heidi nickered and came to the edge of the pen seeking sugar . " All right . " THE JEEP slewed around in a tight circle , so quickly that only the ballast of several enthusiastically inebriated colonials kept it from tipping over on two wheels . Zack Moscowitz leaned out of the driver 's seat . He was wearing driving goggles above a shaggy black mustache . " All aboard ! Will each passenger kindly check his or her own tokens ? " Cadmann grinned in amusement . His or her . Like a book from the twenty-first century . " H'lo , Boss . " Moscowitz wiped at his goggle lenses but only succeeded in smearing the dirt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 'd the outing go ? " " Great . " Cadmann stood unmoving . Terry had already claimed the seat in front next to Zack 's wife , Rachel . There was no other place to sit . " Here we go , Cad . " George Merriot squeezed over to make room . It took some squeezing  --  George could use a few extra sit-ups . " Thanks , Major . " " Not any more , Cad . " " Right . " Weyland climbed over Barney Can and Carolyn , one of the McAndrews twins . He wiggled his way into the middle . " Seat belts , right ? Everybody , right ? " There was a chorus of bored assents . Zack gunned the jeep and roared out of camp . The road out to the beach was smoother than that leading to the mountains , and more frequently traveled . It served the orbital shuttle , which made water landings . " No problems , Cadmann ? " the Administrator shouted . " Ah  --  nothing , Zack . " Cadmann was momentarily distracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bump in the road to lean closer to him . Now if it had been Phyllis . . . but Phyllis and Hendrick Sills were a pair , and the twins were not identical . Carolyn was sallow in both complexion and personality . He smiled at her anyway .  | " What about the fence ? " " Nothing serious . Break . I fixed it . " George Merriot laughed . " Hey , Zack , for a bare instant there , I thought you were n't playing company director this evening . " Moscowitz wove deftly around a pothole . " Never happened . Check that fence in daylight tomorrow , would you , Cad ? " " Enough ! " Rachel Moscowitz shouted . " No business tonight . The night shift 's on duty . Remember ? " " There was something , " Cadmann said . Moscowitz slowed , his eyes still on the road . " Yes ? " " Bit of disturbance with the animals . They were acting like rush hour at the stockyard . Scared . Crazy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow from the back of his neck . " Might not be anything , but you never know . I took out one of the dogs . Sheena . She got away . " " Aw , not Sheena . Where 's she go ? " " Who cares ? " George demanded . " They all got out last week . She 'll come back . " Zack kept the jeep burning along the track at a racing pace , and as they bumped over a rise near the ring of thorn bushes , Cadmann could see taillights in front of them . We 're in the last jeep ? Christ , he drives fast Cadmann asked , " Something special about Sheena ? " Zack said , " Naw , I 've been slipping her a few scraps , that 's all . " " He wants her in our home , " Rachel said . " And we do n't have enough room . " " Would n't be fair anyway . " When Zachariah Moscowitz laughed , his heavy arching eyebrows and thick mustache simply cried for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tattooed Lady . " " Ten dogs , and a hundred sixty colonists . Does n't make a whole lot of sense to get proprietary , does it ? " " No . Zack , stop . I 'll go back and find her . " " Come on . " Moscowitz flipped up the filthy goggles . " Gives me a whole new outlook on life . George , give the Colonel a drink , will you ? Cad , we 're not on duty tonight . Smell the sea and drink the beer and the hell with it . " Cadmann did n't laugh . The salt breezes tickled his nose now , and it cleaned away some of his worry . But he 'd lost Zack 's dog ! Zack was still talking . " I do n't suppose that this really impacts on you , Cad , but I 've been a paper pusher most of my life . Administration type .  | " You 're still the only man I know with pencil calluses behind his ear . " Ah , but things are n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ride it lightyears from home , on a planet still two twitches this side of the Jurassic . " " And so ? " Cadmann could hear the breakers now , rolling in steady rhythm against the shore . " And so on Earth I made decisions and was responsible for maybe one five-billionth of what happened on the planet . Here , I 'm one one hundred and sixtieth of this planet 's history . I 'll have cities , states named after me . We 'll be in the history books , Cadmann , and schoolchildren will know our names . " They always did name cities after their founders . They used to name them after warriors , too , but what 's to fight here ? The jeep slowed to a crawl as the road ended at the edge of the beach . Bonfires had already been lit and tended down to a low roar , and the other colonists waved in greeting . Minerva One was ass-on to the beach . A team had anchored a winch in the rock so that the shuttle could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land on water , take off on water , never worry about finding an airport . Its desalinization plant was a box floating alongside , with membranes inside to filter the sea water . The shuttle would be flying up to the mother ship tomorrow , one of Sylvia 's monthly jaunts . She would n't be able to take it next month . Regardless of her protests , no one was going to allow an obviously pregnant biologist to undergo unnecessary g-stresses . As soon as the jeep slewed to a halt , Cadmann and the others piled out . A cooler lay open on the beach . Cadmann fished out a pouch of cold beer . " Zack ! I knew you were the right man to head up this trip . " " Damn straight . You have no idea how hard I fought for that beer . " He dipped into the cooler and extracted a pouch . " We 'll have our brewery next year . " " Thirty months ? " Hendrick Sills shouted , his arm tight around Phyllis 's admirably trim waist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year was two point six times as long as Earth 's . Cadmann was crowded away from the cooler by three enthusiastic partygoers . Cadmann grabbed a spare pouch , then took one of the young women by the shoulder . " Mary Ann . Juniper berries . "  | " Eh ? " Mary Ann Eisenhower looked wary . Her blond hair was plastered down with ocean spray . " What ? " " Juniper berries . You 're in agriculture . Did we bring the seeds ? " Mary Ann wrapped her towel around her shoulders more tightly , brushed a few grains of sand away from her cleavage . " Cadmann , I do n't know ! Why ? " " I want to make the first drinkable martini on Tau Ceti Four . That will earn me a statue . " She frowned , then grinned widely . " You 're on . I 'll look ! " She reached toward him shyly . " Uh , want to swim ? " Like many of the others , she had stripped down to shorts . " Cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's nice when you get out . " She reached toward him . " Mary Ann ! Come on ! " Joe Sikes called . Cadmann did n't like him . His wife had had a baby only a week before , and he was already running after other women . Mary Ann turned , mouth set in a line . " If you 're in such a hurry , why do n't you just go find Evvie ? " Joe glowered , unable to think of an answer , and slunk back toward the ocean . " Cad ? " It was Sylvia . Cadmann turned . " Speaking . " The corner of his eye caught Mary Ann disappearing toward the water . Where Sikes was waiting . It irritated him , and he wondered why he gave a damn . Sylvia was over by the fire . She wore a two-piece swimsuit , something from an Earth designer who had understood what to conceal and what to reveal . Cadmann started toward her , then stopped as Terry came into the circle of firelight . Terry kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her stick and handed her a much bigger one . Terry chewed contentedly . " Ah  --  Cad , did you fix the fence ? " Sylvia asked . A voice too close behind Cadmann laughed . " I am not the only admirer of Senorita Faulkner , s. ? " " Senora . Go jump in a thorn bush . Here . " He tossed his spare beer pouch over his shoulder . " Think fast ! Good catch . " A guitar twanged nonsensically , then produced a tune Cadmann had not heard since his youth . Marnie McInnes played while Barney Can and her husband , Jerry , sang with good-natured tonelessness . Two  | much better voices dominated the choruses from somewhere on the far side of the fire : Ernst and La Donna Stewart . Phyllis danced for her own pleasure , for the colonists , and most especially for Hendrick , who watched her with pride and hunger . Carolyn watched for a few seconds , then humphed and stamped off . Carlos watched Phyllis for a dozen bars , examining her movement with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She is good , that one , " he said offhandedly . " She must learn the real flamenco technique . " " And you 'll be glad to teach her . " " But of course . " " Go for it . Talk to Hendrick though . She may need a teacher , but he definitely needs a sparring partner . " " Sparring partner ? No comprendo . " " Hendrick Sills was Golden Gloves middleweight champ about six years before we left Earth . Bet he 'd love to discuss it with you . " " On the other hand . . . " Cadmann ambled over to the roasting pit . Spicy meat smells rose from the grill . Much of the food was reconstituted , pouched and freeze-dried and soaked in water or wine  --  but there were two chickens and a turkey . Cadmann imagined he had known from the smell Morale must be worse than I thought if Zack authorized this burnt offering . Lost crops and too much work . Thornwood logs made excellent coals when hot enough . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely with the moist breeze from the ocean . Twin moonglades danced in the surf . Sylvia poked in the grill with a long metal skewer . She glanced to her left where Terry was eating . He was n't half finished . " Almost done , Cad . " She turned the samlon steak . Even this cross section of the creature was queer , unearthly . The meat was pink like salmon , but two big arteries showed alongside its heavy spine  --  for heavier gravity  --  and the shape showed its flattened belly and strong bones . " Big enough for two , Cad . Another minute . " " Sure . " He sat beside her . " Hi . " " Hi yourself . I thought you might not come . " " So you sent Terry to fetch me . " " Sure . " She speared a samlon . " Just right . Share ? " " Love to . "  | She hoisted it up and nibbled at it , and sputtered as she burned her mouth . Cadmann could n't help laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed toward the stars , and when he looked up , stuffed one of the hottest portions into his mouth . " Laugh at me , will you ? " " Molten metal , molten metal you do know the punishment for witches , Esmeralda . " " Sure , they hanged her goat . But Charles Laughton will give me sanctuary . Have some more . " He held up his hands in protest . " No , thanks . My tongue would never forgive me . " But the first fragment had cooled , and it tasted fine . Taste of salmon , texture of ... what ? It was n't flaky like fish . Beef heart ? Striated , no fat . . She jabbed the second portion at him again , and he splashed some sand at it . " Get that poor dead thing away from me before I spank you . " Her eyes sparkled . " You . . . " Terry was close behind her , close enough that she fell silent , smiled and went back to tending the sizzling barbecue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his cooling plate of canned vegetables . He stared across the sea . Ernst and La Donna stood up from where they 'd been eating , hurled turkey bones into the dark and walked after them . Ernst waved cheerfully as they passed . Cadmann smiled but did n't wave ; he could see La Donna 's sudden embarrassment . Good . Salvage those good genes , La Donna ! With luck the kids would look like Ernst , too . La Donna was nice , but plain . Cadmann moved to the edge of the magic circle of light , away from the others . The waves seemed vast inky shapes , rolling up and thrashing themselves into foam on the sand . There were shrieks of pleasure from the colonists playing in the water . A pleasantly rounded shape ran from the darkness to the light . " We have them . " " Have ? ? " " Juniper berries , silly . I remembered . " Mary Ann shook water onto him and handed him a towel . " Dry me ? " He smiled good-naturedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed in the double moonlight , and her skin was baby smooth and clear . Her body was toned and well-rounded . Rubens would have lusted to paint her  --  or something . Avalon 's increased gravity had added six pounds to her weight when she set foot on the ground . All of the colonists showed better muscle tone , and so did Mary Ann . She giggled and leaned back into him in a clear invitation . Method- ically he scrubbed out the wet tips of her hair and worked his way quickly down her body . She sighed and shuddered slightly . " You have talents I did n't know ' bout , Cad . " " Part of the service . ' Where 's Joe ? " He moved his hands under the towel . Her eyelids fluttered with brief , suppressed pain . " We do n't keep track of each other . " Her expression tightened . " Ah . I owe you a rub now. , , Her skin beneath his hands was cool but growing warm . She 's willing , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she smart enough ? Is n't she Sylvia ? He said , " We 'll take a rain check on that . " " Coward . " Mary Ann brought her pug nose close to his . " I 'll never live to see the day . " He winked at her . " I may surprise you yet . " " Hah ! " she said , and jiggled off to another bonfire . The men there shouted as she approached . Cadmann looked determinedly at the twin moons . We ca n't keep calling them " Big " and " Little . " " Cadmus " ? That 's a good name for a moon  --  oh , hell , here comes Terry . Terry Faulkner said , " She 's a dish . " " Yes , I 've always liked Sylvia . " Terry 's nose wrinkled . " Mary Ann . She likes you . She 's told me . " Cadmann said nothing . Terry said , " I 've noticed that you do n't keep company with any of the ladies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry . " " True . . . " Terry 's gaze panned from Mary Ann to Sylvia . " But there is one lady you 've been spending a lot of time around , you know . " " Come off it . Sylvia and I are just friends . " " I know . " There was a cutting edge to Terry 's voice . " You were pretty friendly the first three months you were down , while the rest of us were asleep up in the ship . " He made harsh squiggling patterns in the sand with his toe . " What 's your point ? " " I 'd just feel a lot better about it if you had a nice healthy interest in one of the other ladies , that 's all . " Carlos was loitering nearby , his ear innocently turned in their direction . Cadmann cleared his throat loudly . " Now hear this . Boy , would I like a beer right now . " " Con gusto , amigo . " Carlos walked away whistling .  | " Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife . We talk. ? " " A damned lot . " Cadmann pointedly eyed the beer in Terry 's hand . " Yes . We talk . And if you talked to Sylvia more , she would n't need a friend so badly . " Terry froze . " My relationship with Sylvia is none of your damned business . " " You brought it up . Which makes it my business . We talk , and if you 're worried that she looks for more than talk , maybe there 's something else you do n't give her enough of . " Terry turned away , walked two steps and turned back . " You really are an asshole , Weyland . " He turned away . " Ter " ry . Faulkner stopped . " What ? " " Did you think that getting Sylvia knocked up as soon as they thawed you out would hang a big hands off ' sign on her ? " There was a sudden lull in the air around them . Every face near them was carefully , deliberately turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed with blood . Terry 's hands hooked into claws , and his mouth worked silently . Too loud ! Aw , shit . The thin man kicked at the fire , sending a burst of sparks into the air . " You know , Weyland , I do n't really care what went on before I woke up . Because you 're not the big man anymore . You 're not a farmer , you 're not a builder . You 're not even an engineer . You 're just an assistant navigator , and an extremely expendable security arm . " He leaned closer to Cadmann , who lowered his eyelids slightly . " I hear that you want to be part of the mainland expedition I 'm putting together . Just watch your step . Be very careful that you do n't suddenly become obsolete . I 'd hate to see Colonel Weyland pulling weeds or mucking out the stables to earn his bread . " He turned and stalked away . Wordlessly , Carlos tossed Cadmann a pouch of beer . Cadmann bit it open and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running down his chin . Terry grabbed Sylvia by the arm and pulled her aside for a talk . His gestures were violent and jerky , like a puppet with tangled strings . Sylvia 's face was impassive , her answers calm , and finally he quieted . The entire beach seemed to heave a sigh of relief , and slowly the music and laughter rose up from a soft burr and swallowed the silence .  | Carlos poked his arm . " He 's wrong about you , is n't he , amigo ? You 've never made a move on the lovely lady . " " Not yet . " " Meaning ? " Carlos ' dark face was split in a suggestive grin . " Meaning that I 'm going for a walk . " " Have a good walk , amigo ! I think I 'm going to investigate Carolyn . " " She 's a tease . " " She 's also depressed . I have just the thing for her . " " Your generosity never ceases to amaze me . Bon appetit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huge beached shuttle . He did n't stop until he was lost in the shadows . When Marnie 's guitar was no more than broken rhythm against the surf he turned to look at the wavering lights and listen to the sounds downbeach . The night wind brought a whiff of seaweed and salt and roast samlon , and the sound of merriment . A finger stroked lightly along his spine , and he turned , startled . Mary Ann smiled at him . She was breathing heavily , wet sand splashed along her calves from a jog in the surf . Her eyes were wide and luminously dark . " You 're a strange one , " she said . " You know how I can always find you ? " " How ? " He reached out , lacing his fingers behind her neck . Impossibly , her skin seemed cool and hot at the same time . I don ' t want you , he said silently , but I need . . . " I just look for where people are having fun , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadmann Weyland , off to the side , watching . " Go away . Just go away , he thought , drawing her closer . " Watching , " he said . She shivered as he traced a circle under her ear . " I do n't always just watch . " Suddenly , he wanted very , very much to put the lie to her words . Her eyes reflected the glowing surf . When she spoke again , her voice was husky . " Well , I tell you what . Why do n't you show me what you do when you 're not just watching ? " She linked her arms around his neck . He did n't know whom he needed to convince more , himself or Mary Ann . But there are times when twin aims share a single purpose , like twin moons casting a single shadow . She took his hand and led him away from the campfires , toward warmth .  | SOMETHING was ahead of her . Sheena strained to reach it . A shadow bigger than herself , it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of it , then streaking away into the dark , cutting behind the animal cages , across the stream , into the cultivated ground . Sheena yipped in confusion , disbelieving what she had seen . Machines moved that quickly , but not animals . She sniffed the ground . The new smell was already faint , so fast had it moved , but there was no mistaking it . Wet and warm , and unlike men or calves or chickens or anything in the compound : the stink of it was a mortal insult ! She streaked after it , splashing through the icy water , shaking her fur before continuing on into the dark . She was beyond the plowed area , into the zone filled with burnt crumbled tree stumps and sprigs of tough grass just now puffing up through the blackened crust of the earth . Where was it ? Clouds were moving across the smaller moon , and Sheena sniffed the ground again , purring low in her throat . The cloud cover parted for a moment . There on the hillock , black with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instincts could n't identify it . Big . Not man . No ancestor had hunted this thing , none had fled and lived to remember . Her cortex knew what it was not , but could not say what it was . Unknown . A threat . It might harm man or man 's children . Kill ! The thing cocked its head sideways and cooed . The sounds were disturbing . What had ever sounded like that ? Where were the men ? Sheena 's ears flattened back against her head . This was not a dog 's job . There were no men here . Sheena leaped to do battle . One moment it was there , and Sheena 's teeth were snapping at its neck . Her teeth closed on nothing . It receded like a cloud-shadow beneath the moon , and returned as fast , and now it was on Sheena 's back . Its cold , broad feet clamped around her middle with sudden , terrifying strength . Sheena 's ribs sagged inward . She snarled her agony and rolled to mash the thing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling and was several feet away . Fast , unfairly fast ! Thick fleshy lips pulled back from daggerlike teeth in a grimace of pleasure . Lovingly it cooed to Sheena . Sheena was terrified now , but she leaped . She was in the air when the creature rolled . Its jaws flashed up and  | locked on her throat , reducing her death scream to no more than a terrified hiss . It drew back into the shadows before she hit the ground . She lay on her side , struggling weakly to breathe , bubbles of air shining blackly in the moonlight as they pulsed from her throat . She watched her killer draw close , stared into its eyes , its huge , soft , silver eyes . She whimpered . It cooed at her , and when Sheena 's flanks ceased trembling , came closer and gently licked at the blood oozing from her throat . The creature was hot , like a stove . It turned its back . Sheena felt blades entering her , and then nothing .  | GEOGRAPHIC was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from below as the shuttle rose to meet her , the ship looked like a gigantic flashlight with a silver doorknob attached to the end . The aft end was a ring of laser fusion reactors , a flaring section twice the diameter of the trunk . The trunk , over a hundred and fifty meters in length , was the cylinder that housed the life-support systems and cryogenic suspension facilities . Minerva Two was approaching the fore end : the laboratories and the crew quarters , where Cadmann had spent five waking years of his life . The dock was a conical cagework at the end of a protruding arm , barely visible even this close . Minerva Two slowed as she rounded the fuel balloon . Bobbi Kanagawa was a cautious pilot . Cadmann 's fingers itched and twitched . His touch would have been surer , his approach would have been faster . But he was n't flying Minerva Two . Geographies fuel balloon was shrunken , spent , and half its original size . Only a breath of gas remained of a half-kilometer sphere of deute- rium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . We were Homo interstellar , Cadmann thought . We will be again . Some of the external paneling had been stripped away from Geographic and shuttled down to Tau Ceti Four for building material . The shuttle maneuvered past a drifting mass . The tightly wrapped cylinder , scores of kilometers of superconducting wire , waited to be loaded in Minerva Two 's bay by robot limpet motors . These would become part of the fusion plant . Its completion meant limitless power . Eventually the Orion craft would be a skeleton , just an orbiting splinter of light in the sky . Perhaps she might survive in smaller form , with most of the life-support cylinder removed : an interplanetary vehicle , a gift of space to grandchildren yet unborn . Bobbi Kanagawa counted softly to herself as Geographic loomed on the screen , the onboard computer continually checking her approach pattern . " Almost home , " she said without looking back at her passengers . Sylvia reached over and pinched Cadmann 's arm . " Are you all right ? " " I 've never liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky now ; more , as the silver wall of the fuel balloon slid past and the conical cagework opened like a mouth . " And if you 're a Freudian , I do n't want to hear it . " The shuttle 's nose grated along the cagework and nuzzled into the lock at its base : click-thump . Cadmann sighed in relief and released his shoulder straps . Bobbi made her last-minute checks , then swung out of her seat with practiced ease . " All right , folks , this is a two-hour turnaround . Hope you do n't need more time . " Some of her straight black hair had escaped its binding , and drifted out at disconcerting angles when she moved . " Two should do it . " Sylvia strapped on her backpack . The door at the rear of the shuttle hissed open , and Stu Ellington 's voice chuckled at them from the control module . " It 's about time . Swear to God that 's just like a woman . Two-tenths of a second late again . " Bobbi glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just keep talking , Stu , " she said sweetly . " You need all the friends you can get  --  the last vote was dead even for leaving your worthless carcass up here another month . " " Oops . Tell you what . Drop your friends in the lab , come on up to Command , and we 'll discuss my carcass for an hour or so . " Bobbi 's pale cheeks reddened . She ran her hand over her hair , dis- covering the flyaway strands . " I ... uh , well ? " she looked at Sylvia , who winked sagely . " I 'll see you in a month , huh ? " She scurried to be the first through the hatch . She disappeared down a narrow connective hallway as Sylvia led Cadmann to the central corridor and back to the biolab section . Cadmann clucked in puritan disgust . " Sex . I remember sex . Highly overrated . " " Great attitude for a biologist . " " Just a Bachelor 's , and it was marine biology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She lays ' em , and he swims over ' em . " " You 're a romantic , that 's what you are . " Sylvia worked her way along the handrails gingerly and seemed ill at ease . " All this time , " she said , so softly that he wondered if she had intended for him to hear . " What ? " " After all this time , I still get a little claustrophobic in here . " She laughed uneasily . " You 're not the only one . " He slammed the flat of his palm against one of the steel-and-plastic panels that lined Geographic . The vibration thrummed along the hexagonal corridor , damping out before it reached the first corner . " This place was home and prison to all of us for a long time . Some of the colonists wo n't come back up at all . " " It does n't make sense , really . Just forget it . " He leaned up behind her and whispered in her ear . " It 's return-tothe-tomb syndrome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression . " All of us spent at least a hundred and five years asleep in a little coffin-shaped box , awakened from the dead by a trickle of electricity through our brains . " " Lovely . We 'll put you in charge of bedtime stories . I 'll manage the sedative concession . " The door to the biolab was sealed to protect both the life within and the crew without . Some of the substances and microscopic life forms were extremely vulnerable , and others extremely dangerous . Sylvia punched in her four-digit personal code , and the door opened inward . In case of a loss of atmosphere in the main section of the ship , air pressure alone would keep the door sealed . " We 'll have this reprogrammed to admit you . " The lights came up automatically as the door closed behind them . The room was the second-largest on Geographic . Its floor space was crowded with medical and analytical equipment , its walls completely  | lined with cryogenic vaults . There were hundreds of the dark plastic rectangles , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shucked her backpack onto a wall hanger and pulled herself over to a rack of Velcro slippers . She handed him a pair . " One size fits all . " " I was hoping for something in a wing tip . " She led him to the nearest bank of cases . " Look , " she said contentedly , triggering one of the dark panels into translucence . Within , barely discernible as canine , were dozens of dog embryos . Their dark eyes were filmed with transparent lids , tiny naked paws drawn up to their gauzy bodies in peaceful cryosleep . Each hung in its individual sack , connected by its umbilical to an artificial placenta . " So . " She studied the temperature and pressure gauges on the door of a sealed cabinet , nodded and opened it . " Alfalfa seeds . Check . Swiss chard . Check . Tomatoes . Check . " She closed the cabinet . " Now for the embryos . The carriers are in that case over there . Inflate three for me , will you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier console . " You do n't trust the computer ? " Cadmann asked . " Not anymore . Not since Ernst . Not since eight of us never woke up . Barney says it 's fine , but I 'm a woman of little faith these days . " " Good thinking . " She typed in the last commands . " There . So we lost one of the dogs . We 've got over a hundred more . " " And thousands of chickens , I suppose ? " His voice was too flat , too distanced from his feelings . " Look , Cad  --  I do n't care what anyone says , it 's not your fault . Sheena got loose a week ago . So  --  she came back last night and broke into one of the chicken cages . Fine . We 'll either catch her or kill her . Nothing to worry about . " He heard her words , but his mind was still on the chicken cage as they had found it that morning , its wire mesh ripped out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little clotted chunks of raw chicken littering the ground like the aftermath of a ghoulish picnic . " That is what you 're worried about , is n't it ? " Annoyed with himself , Cadmann derailed the morbid train of thought . " Sure . That 's it . " Although he had worked the biolab before , she gave him the grand  | tour . There was a complete assortment of dairy and work animals , as well as millions of earthworms , ladybugs and " friendly " insect eggs . " We have to have quadruplication of any needed form . There are going to be failures , " Sylvia said bluntly . " The alfalfa crop , for instance . We do n't know why yet . " Her eyes glittered , and the sudden determination in her face cubed her attractiveness . Cadmann 's chest tightened . " But I guarantee you we 'll know . And soon . We 're going to lose more animals , and we 've got to be ready for that , too . That 's where you 'll come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll hustle up Mamie or her husband , Jerry . We 've got to be ready for anything . " She darkened the panels and took his hand , leading him to the other side of the room . The vaults were identical to those opposite , but he could feel her increased excitement . " Look , " she whispered , and illumined the panels . " Our children . " They hung in rows , lost in endless dream . ( Cadmann was startled at the thought . Were there dreams in cryosleep ? The neurologists said no , but his memory said yes . Perhaps it was only that before the drugs took hold and the blood chilled there was one final thought that remained locked in a frozen brain , a thought that unthawed along with the body . Just a wisp of dream at the beginning of sleep and one at the end , linked by decades of silence and darkness . ) One of Sylvia 's hands strayed unconsciously to her own belly , its roundness barely noticeable beneath her jumpsuit . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age . They were thumb-sized and milky pale , heads as large as their bodies , with their fluid-filled amniotic sacs billowing about them . Cadmann came up close to the glass , counting the tiny fingers and toes , gazing at the gently lowered eyelids , the amber umbilicals attached to artificial placentas . " They 're all perfect , " Sylvia said . " Every one of them certified perfect , genetically and structurally . " His breath had fogged the glass . He patted her stomach . " Not like Jumbo here , who has to take his chances . " Sylvia drew away from him , face troubled . She shut off the light in the embryo bank . " Cad . . . if you 'd try to be a little nicer to Jumbo 's father , things would be easier for all of us . " There was nothing in her face he could feel angry with . His hand still tingled from the contact . " I knew it . A nice trip for old Weyland . Find him a useful job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets  | sent to the outback where he belongs . Cadmann Weyland . First of the Great White Abos . " She shook her head and gave him a hug . " We know things are n't easy for you but at least you know why you 've got problems . Terry just knows that when he thawed out he was n't quite the same anymore . Terry and Ernst . . . Carolyn . . . Alicia . . . Mary Ann . . " What ? Mary Ann Eisenhower ? " " Well , she 's not one of the bad ones . " " She seems ? " " Sure , she 's normal . Cad , she lost some brain cells in frozen sleep . She is n't stupid , but she used to be brilliant , and she remembers , Cad . She and Hendrick Sills were the top bridge players , and they shared a bed too , before we put the colonists to sleep . Tom Eisenhower woke up dead , and Hendrick gets very uncomfortable if he 's in the same room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and Mary Ann cries on Rachel 's couch . " Cadmann touched her hand . " But she 's a normal , healthy , sexy woman if you did n't know her before . These changes can be very subtle , Cad . Carolyn McAndrews was second in command to Zack . Nobody wants to work with her now . She did n't turn stupid , but she goes into hysterics . " " And maybe there 's a dead place in old Cadmann 's brain too . " " Not that we can tell  --  like I said , you 've got reasons to feel out of place . The others just know that the cryogenics were n't perfect . That the nightmares are a little darker . Maybe it is n't quite as easy to remember a favorite poem , or extract a cube root , or run the Twelve-Fourteen Convention in bridge . " She paused , and her voice dropped . " Or make love . We do n't know what it is yet . It 'll be twenty years before we get any answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabilizers , and make-work projects . And there 's hope . Most of us are fine . Our genes are good . We 'll do everything humanly possible to keep you on the team . Can you blame us ? " He took her shoulders , gazing down into her eyes . The air was tart with disinfectant and dehumidifier ; her perfume was a wisp of citrus and crushed rose petal , the only thing in the ship that smelled alive . " What us ' ? What about ? ? " The intercom crackled , and Stu Ellington said , " We 've got a message for you , Weyland . Development landside . Something about some chickens . " Sylvia disengaged herself from him gently , triggering the nearest  | intercom phone with an unsteady finger . Her eyes were still locked to Cadmann 's . " D-do n't worry . We 'll be bringing down more embryos . " " It 's not that . " It was Bobbi who spoke this time , and her voice was excited . " Mits Kokubun found some tracks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " " Paw prints ? " Sylvia frowned . " Do n't know . Zack said that they just did n't look like anything he 'd seen . Wants Cadmann to take a look at them . Soonest . " " Pipe it in . " " They did n't send pictures . " " Think you two can cut your snuggle session down so Stu can give us a ride home ? " Stu groaned massively . " Oh , if I must ? " and dropped off the line . Cadmann cleared his throat , backing up a half step . " Was there anything else you wanted to show me ? " She retrieved her backpack , fumbled out a handful of dark plastic cartridges and held them before her like a shield . " You 've used the computer . You 'll be running some programs for me , and I . . . " Her eyes dropped . " Oh , hell , Cad . I do n't know what I wanted . We . . . I just want everything to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cad . I do n't want to lose you . " Suddenly she seemed very small and awkward . " I love you . You 're my friend . " The moment that followed was uncomfortably long and painfully silent . Then Cadmann 's lips curled in a smile . " Tell you what . Let 's go roust Stu 's ass and get a lift home . How 's that ? " " Perfect . " THE CHICKEN COOPS were nestled next to the single-story sheet-metal structure of the machine shop , and the ground around them was well trodden . It had never been plowed , and was the same burnt , packed earth that lay beneath most of the Colony . When Cadmann got there , a fifteen-by-thirty-meter block of ground had been marked off with rope to protect the footprints . A score of colonists were still huddled around the periphery . Joe Sikes 's wife , Evvie , held her baby tightly against her breast , the child 's reddish scalp shining through thin , limp blond hair . The baby gurgled , unconcerned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony 's second . The first , April Clifton , was still in intensive care . Carlos stood with Mitsuo Kokubun and Harry Siep , and they were grinning . Harry preened his heavy growth of beard , hiding his mouth  | behind his fingers as he whispered something to Mits . All three choked on repressed laughter . Zack ran his fingers through black hair that had been noticeably thicker only months before . When Cadmann broke through the ring of spectators and squatted to take a close look at the tracks , Zack punched him lightly on the shoulder , relief and gratitude tattooed across his face in bold strokes . " Glad you 're here , " Zack said . " What do you make of this ? " Cadmann hitched his trousers and bent , peering closely at the depressed ridges of the footprint . It was just broader than his hand , with four distinct , roughly triangular toes . He ran his finger along it lightly . He asked , " Have we taken a cast of this ? " " Marnie did . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power back through them if we have to . " There were eight of the prints , some faint , some clear and sharp . One in front of the chicken coop was smeared . He stood and looked back along the path the tracks had taken  --  they led in the direction of the mountains , but disappeared long before they reached the plowed ground . Suspicion niggled at the back of his mind . " You know , " Cadmann said finally , " I could have sworn there were n't any tracks here when I left this morning . " Zack shook his head . " Beats me . There was someone here all the time , Cad . The overcast was pretty bad . Maybe the sun had to be just so high before we could spot them . " The crowd had thinned a bit . " Nola , amigo . Any ideas ? " Cadmann studied the ground , then Carlos 's overeager smile . Little Rick Erin , standing next to Carlos , was having trouble managing his face . Cadmann walked slowly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea . I think it was made by something that was highly skilled , bipedal , not overly intelligent , and weighed about ? " he looked Carlos over carefully . " About seventy kilos , I 'd guess . We 'll call it illegitimus estz pido for the time being . I 'm mixing languages there , but I think you get my drift . " He turned on his heel . " Cadmann ? " " Yeah ? " " Nothing . " As he walked away Cadmann heard sniggers and the sound of back- slapping . Idiots . He doused the flare of anger as he came back to the ruined coop . " What do you think , Cad ? " Zack looked puzzled . " This was a hoax . This was . " Cadmann 's face was still burning . " I like the idea of checking the fences . Get them ready . " He looked out over the flat ground , past the fluffy cultivated rows , past the ring of thorn trees to the mountains and jungle beyond . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these chickens are still dead . I do n't think we 've got anyone dumb enough to murder a bunch of our chickens for a joke . I do n't much care who laughs at me  --  let 's be ridiculously cautious for a while , eh ? " Cadmann stepped on the nearest print . If he had strapped , say , a rubber cutout to the bottom of his shoe , he could walk carefully back and forth , making those goddamn prints right in front of everyone 's nose , and then stand back and watch the fun . . . . Behind him someone made a doglike yipping sound . He did n't turn to look .  | Six WEEKS after the incident at the coops , a mild eruption on the northwest side of the island shook the ground . Three days later threadlike wisps of ash still drifted from the air . The mists that enshrouded the mountain peaks had dropped in a gray blanket , diffusing the light of Tau Ceti . Streamers of light flashed within the cloud banks , and thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into neutral and watched the clouds cautiously . The engine 's hum strummed his spine . " Do n't worry , " Mary Ann called to him . " That 's just a little mountain storm . It does n't care about us . " She moved between knee-high rows of plants , checking the slender soil-meter rods for moisture and pH . The alfalfa replanting was being cautiously hailed as a success . Failure of the first crop was attributed to the thorn trees which had once dominated the plain . When the trees were burned away their taproots remained alive underground , leaching moisture from the soil . Alfalfa ,  | with a potential yield of ten tons per acre , requires tremendous amounts of water . Omar Isfahan and Jon van Don , two of the Colony 's engineers , had planned and installed a more extensive irrigation system . " We could use the water , either way . But if it 's going to rain , I 'm wasting my time up here . " " Practice . Practice . We all take rotation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her hair , and it warmed him . They had grown closer in the weeks since his talk with Sylvia aboard Geographic . Hibernation Instability . He saw her differently now . She was n't bright . . . and yet she had been . Wounded in the war to capture AvaIon ; wounded in his war . The electrified fences had been expanded and strengthened . When there was no additional trouble , the animals were turned out into the northern pasture . Some of the older lambs and calves were already grazing contentedly . No additional trouble . . . Cadmann liked the sound of that , even if there was a part of him that did n't quite believe it . ( Did n't want to believe it ? ) He had returned twice to Geographic . He liked that . Checking the embryos was sheer routine ; but one side of the crew lounge was a wide window . Cadmann could sit and look up at Avalon , and feel peace . So beautiful . Spirals of white storm , blazing white of polar caps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent .. white against the rich blue of a water-and-oxygen atmosphere , a world that men could take and tame . Zack had been right . Their grandchildren would conquer this world , and the first hundred and sixty colonists would be remembered for all time . Immortality . At what price ? A century of sleep ? Brain damage for a few ; Ernst and Mary Ann and Carolyn and , yes , Terry , were paying the price for all . But for the rest : bruises and sprains , and maybe a few bad dreams ? He had to laugh . The pilgrims who had founded the American continent had paid far more dearly to accomplish less . Tau Ceti Four 's colonials had it easy . The air was suddenly cold . Raindrops spattered against his hands and the hood of the tractor . " Shit-oh-dear , " Mary Ann said , gazing up at the clouds . They coiled angrily in the sky like a vast heap of coals : black around the edges ,  | fire flickering in the core . The lightning flashes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distant rolling explosion . " So much for the weather report , Mary Ann . " The wind was whipping the rain into sheets , and he turned up his collar . " Come on , hop aboard  --  I 'll give you a ride back to the shed . " She clipped a handful of green sprouts and stuffed them into her blouse pocket . She hunched her shoulders and clopped through the broken ground , climbed up behind him on the tractor and wrapped her arms around him . He felt her shiver as her breasts pressed into his back . He said , " We 'll just have to have Town Meeting early . Good . I want that damned current turned back on . I 'm sick of hearing about how I 'm overreacting . " He lifted the digging tool from the ground and headed back toward Civic Center . She squeezed him tight , in a special rolling way that she had . It took the edge off his ire , but he grumbled on . " Well , it sure as hell is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need , rain or shine . " " Everybody says it 's a lot of trouble just to stop a dog . " " Right . A dog . " He sighed . " All right . They 're entitled to their opinion . I 'm entitled to mine . " Her voice was muffled against his back . " You 're not alone . You have me , too . But we 're just two . " The rain was still fairly light as he drove the tractor into the shed . The other farming equipment was being brought in , and the colonists were beginning to gather , heading for the meeting hall . Cadmann shut down the tractor and squeezed water from his hair . " I 'll be in in a minute , " she called , hopping down from the back of the tractor . She paused at the doorway to turn up her collar , then ran out in the direction of the corral . Maybe Mary Ann was right . His was a minority opinion . Madman Weyland sees bogeymen in every corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrich the soil with their bodies and their wastes . When he thought of these things , he should have thought of life , instead of a dog that had never come back , and a mangled chicken cage .. IT LOVED a rainy night . It could always move about on land , slowly , lazily , and tolerate the heat for hours at a time ; but movement at hunting speed required a  | quick kill , then a frantic race to the river to shed the terrible heat within . Night and rain extended its time on dry land . It had changed when it became an adult . Its mind and senses adapted for life out of water ; but from birth it had been intensely curious . Frustratingly , there had been nothing for its curiosity to chew on . Birds and swimmers were its world , a prison for its starved senses , until the intruders introduced it to the world beyond the rock wall . They were so strange ! They built angular nests . They tottered on their hind Iegs or attached themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes they would let themselves be swallowed up by them , much like swimmers would . They lived with creatures even stranger than themselves . On the first night it had killed a four-legged thing . The dog had run after it rather than fleeing . It had played with the dog , dancing around it and watching its antics . When the game grew tiresome , it tore out the animal 's throat . The blood was thick and hot and delicious . Afterward it had felt overheated . It had hooked its tail spines into the dog 's throat and dragged the corpse back toward the river , where it could cool itself and eat at leisure . Sport ! Swimmers were never such fun . The flying things that sometimes fed on them were too much of a challenge . It thought about that night , and pleasure rippled through its body . There had been another night when it broke through prickly barriers , following a tantalizing scent . The nest of wood and thin tough vine had resisted only for a moment , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedgelike head squeezed into the box . What noise they had made ! They had tried to fly , but badly . None were fast , none could fight . It was not even sport . It was only feeding . . . but feeding was its own reward , and anything that did n't taste like a swimmer was food for thought . That was days past . Now it watched something that looked to be good sport . A single invader was walking out by the rows of thorned vines that protected a group of four-legged grass-eaters . The invader looked frequently up at the clouds , no doubt enjoying the fall of rain , and shook water out of the dark fur on its head . The invader never looked behind the tarpaulin-sheltered jeep parked to the side of the grazing land . The man walked to within ten feet of it , leaned against the fence with one arm outstretched and spoke to one of the grass-eaters.  | The grass-eater walked clumsily to the fence and licked something out of the man 's hand . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature 's limbs trembled , tingled , its blood singing with anticipation . Come . Just another step .. . Disappointment washed through its mind as the man turned at the call of another of its kind and ran torpidly back toward the lights . Ah , well . There was still the grass-eater . It was near the thorned vines , chewing at something on the ground . It was plump  --  more than twice as large as the dog , almost as large as the creature itself  --  but that was no worry . It could feel that the grass-eater was no fighter . The creature crawled forward until its flat , roughly triangular head peeped from behind the jeep . A raindrop spattered directly into its eye , and its ocular covering thickened momentarily . THE CALF chewed the handful of alfalfa sprouts Mary Ann had brought it . The rain was just beginning to chill its skin , and soon it would head for the metal-roofed shelter in the corner of the pasture to huddle for warmth with its brothers and sisters . There came a rippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed against the wire until it felt the first touch of pain . It lowed plaintively . It shuffled at the fence , afraid to press forward , reluctant to retreat . The shape was a massed shadow flowing around the curve of the jeep . A squat , flattened shadow with disklike , unblinking eyes and a dolphin 's smile . The creature burbled happily . The calf backed away . Sudden , uncomprehending fear pumped adrenaline into its system , sent it stumbling backward toward the shelter . The creature waddled with almost comic clumsiness up to the fence , sniffed at the wire , bit at it experimentally , drew back . The other calves had picked up the scent of fear , and two of them poked their heads from the shelter , looking out through the rain , making deep braying sounds . Calling for the protection of the herd , for the adults , for the bull ! But there were only calves . The rain had grown into a downpour now , and Tau Ceti , already low on the horizon , had disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droplets almost sideways . The young grass was pelted down and mired itself in the mud . Back in the camp , one of the lights flickered , dimmed , then strengthened again .  | Lightning arced jaggedly in the sky , and the calf saw , without comprehending , that the wire was broken , curled back inward , shivering in the wind . A thick shadow squatted in the grass a few feet ahead of the break . It had eyes that glistened , hypnotically vast . It crept slowly forward , even as the calf loped toward the shelter . There were eight of them beneath the sheet metal , packed against each other now , the shared heat of their bodies no match for the wind or the rain or the sudden , crippling fear . The shadow was closer now , very close , immediately in front of the shelter . Great webbed claws landed pad first , then hook-nailed toes gripped the ground to pull it along the grass on its belly . Rain pelted against its skin and unblinking eyes as it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bleating their terror to the wind and the night . Two of them began chewing at the wire at the back of the enclosure , ignoring the pain in their lips and gums , thinking only of the thing that crept in the darkness , eyes wide , unceasing grin opening to reveal rows of chisel teeth . Cooing to them , it sprang . It landed among them , lashing out with claws and teeth . The screams , the smell of alien blood , the terrified eyes that rolled , flashing white in the darkness : it would remember all of these things , and study its memories later , analyze the prey 's habits and its own mistakes . Its ancestors had needed such caution . The prey they had evolved to hunt were more devious , more dangerous than any calf . It snapped and tore at them in the confines of the shelter . Despite their weight it smashed them out of the way , flicking its tail with stunning force , ripping wet strips of flesh from the bone . Finally it fastened its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and cartilage parted and blood spurted warmly into its mouth . The calf trembled . Its last sound was a strangled bleat of despair . The others fled the shelter , escaping through the break in the wire , running out in all directions . The calf 's chest heaved as it lay on its side , heart struggling to beat , to stave off the shock of pain and massive blood loss . Its killer folded its legs and lay down next to it , peering into its eyes as it died , watching them film , the lids falling for the last time . It barbed the grass-eater by the neck and dragged it out of the  | fenced enclosure . Exertion caused heat to build up in its body . Without the cooling rain it would have had to run for the river . The rain quenched the inner fire and the calf 's flesh , warm and rubbery-slick in the darkness , eased the fatigue . THE AROMA of roast turkey mingled with fresh green vegetables , homegrown onions and spices that had traveled ten lightyears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal dining hall were alight with color : newsreels , technical briefs and documentary , personal messages and listings of the material to be found in condensed form , whenever the colonists had the time or interest to decode their messages from Earth . Despite the riot of shape and shade , almost no one was watching : dinner had stolen the show . For the first time in years ( or decades ! ) the majority of the food was not freeze-dried or powdered or syruped . Mary Ann bit into a forkful of fresh green salad and savored the explosion of mingled flavors . The lettuce , tomatoes and mushrooms were all fresh and crisp . Tau Ceti Four bugs seemed uninterested in Earth vegetables ; no pesticide had been used . The milk , the salad dressing , the cheese cubes and the bacon bits had been reconstituted . But soon .. . Beside Mary Ann , Cadmann poured gravy over sliced turkey and stuffing . Across from them , Ernst had done serious damage to an entire turkey drumstick , handling it one-handed . All around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she leaned her head against Cadmann 's shoulder and felt totally satisfied . Out of the corner of her eye she caught his expression , an absent , crooked smile . The tastes and scents and fellowship had driven his concerns into a corner for the time being . There was a ringing thump in the front of the room , and Zack stood , his cheeks stuffed with mashed potatoes . " My fellow citi ? " He got that far before the words were muffled on his food , and his wife Rachel whacked him heartily on his back . He pinched her cheek firmly . " Take two ! We have almost everybody here at the same place and the same time , and although the rain rules out a lot of the work ? " Mary Ann leaned over and pouted . " Ca n't go out checking the fences tonight , mister man . You 're all mine . "  | Cadmann smiled absently . Often he would do that , or not respond at all . She knew better than to let it bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all of it . So the group will be splitting up as soon as the meal is over . This is a good time for a general progress report . " Rachel handed him up a clipboard , and Zack flipped through it , hawing to himself . " All right . As most of you know , the Cliftons ' baby , April , came out of intensive care , and is doing fine in the nursery ? " " Wrong again , Zack ! " Gregory Clifton nudged his wife , Alicia , and she stood , Avalon 's first baby asleep in her arms . The colonists applauded roundly . April woke , looked puzzled . Mary Ann watched mother and baby covetously . The child seemed so peaceful , the mother so happy . There was jealousy and happiness mingled there , because Alicia was one of the nightmare cases . Sleep trauma and some loss of memory had made her one of the colony 's liabilities . Thank God she was a healthy mother . The genes were good , and the child would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found herself leaning closer to Cadmann , brushing his skin . Zack continued . " We 're expecting three more babies next month , so let 's everyone pitch in and give those ladies a hand . We have n't had a single miscarriage or accident , and we want to keep that record clean . " Agriculture . . . Mary Ann ? Do you have anything to say ? " She wiped her mouth hurriedly and stood . " We 've having no more trouble with the , um , alfalfa . The soybeans and the rice are both doing fine . The bees are happy . We 'll wait for a young queen before we try them on any of the native plants . And let 's have a hand for the hydroponics team  --  it 's their tomatoes we 're eating tonight , not mine ! " There was more applause , and Mary Ann started to sit down , then said " oh ! " and popped up again . " The fish are doing fine , both in the breeder ponds and in the rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trout , but that 's to be expected . The big news is that turkeys have been spotted as far as a hundred kilometers away ! " Zack grinned . " It looks to me like we can forget that seeding expedition . Let 's have a vote on that  --  all in favor of dropping the idea ? " He did a quick scan of the forest of hands that sprouted . " That ai n't no majority . I think you 're just giving Agriculture a picnic day , but I guess they deserve it . Now  --  before we get on with the newest broadcasts , is there any more business ? " There was . There were complaints about living space , work duty for  | postnatal mothers and completion schedules for the fusion plant . Then Cadmann stood , and there was an undercurrent of groans in the room . He waited it out . Mary Ann saw the pain in his face , saw him decide to laugh it off as best he could . " Listen  --  I know that I keep getting outvoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . I know that everyone is up to their ears in work , but a few volunteers , working in shifts , could really beef up security . " Terry Faulkner stood , and Mary Ann watched Sylvia 's face closely . Sylvia was a nice lady  --  bright , hard-working , friendly  --  but Sylvia and Cadmann shared something that made her feel shut out . Not sex ; she was sure of that . But she knew that Cadmann had secrets with Sylvia , secrets he would n't share with anyone else , not even his lover . " Listen , Cadmann , " Terry said . He must be in a good mood , Mary Ann thought wryly . Usually he just said Weyland and left it at that . " We 've been going around and around on this for more than a month now . I think you should let it rest . " There was vocal agreement , and Cadmann gritted his teeth . Mary Ann leaned across to put a hand on Ernst 's wrist . Ernst was trying to decide whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up now , and Mary Ann shook her head . He thought it over ; nodded . " I do n't want blood , toil and tears , " Cadmann said . " I just want a little more security , and one man ca n't handle it alone ? " " But would n't you really like to ? Is n't that what you want ? An opportunity to play hero ? " Mary Ann saw the anger sizzling in Cadmann 's eyes ; his fingers gripped the table . He looked down , trying to control his voice . " Terry , that 's not what I 'm after . There 's something going on around here , and I think ? " " I think the chickens are going to be fine ? " Carolyn McAndrews shouted , too loudly , " Oh , shut up , Terry ! " Zack raised his hand . " That 's enough , both of you . I think that Cadmann 's concern is unfounded but heartfelt . It deserves your respect , if not agreement . If anyone wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the meeting . " He slapped his palm down on the table . " And now , if there is no more business , let 's get the lights down and start the tapes . " Cadmann sat down , looking at his hands as the mess hall began to reorganize , the chairs turned around to the wall . Mary Ann shook his shoulder gently . " Cadmann ? "  | He muttered something that she could n't hear , but it sounded like " Idiots . " The lights dimmed , and as they did there was a general movement in the room  --  some leaving , off to bed or indoor jobs , and as they left , the rain was a drumming rhythm that washed in through the door . Mary Ann moved her chair up behind him , stroking the back of his neck , trying to be as close to him as he would let her . He reached up and grasped her hand , holding it too tightly . His fingers were cold . The wall went blank for a moment . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two-hundred-year-old Wizard of Oz began to play , to the cheers of the colonists . Cadmann squeezed her hand and stood . " Where 're you going ? " Mary Ann whispered . " Can I ? ? " He shook his head , and in the dark it seemed that he smiled . Ernst was on his feet . Cadmann pushed him down into his chair ( even he was n't strong enough to do that to Ernst against resistance ) and whispered in his ear . Then he was gone into the milling press at the back of the dining hall . Mary Ann heard the door open and shut , but was n't sure whether or not he 'd left . She cursed herself . You could have said or done something . He 's just not a farmer , and he feels like the third glove in a pair . . . . And that thought was depressing . If she had n't been able to make him feel needed in the six weeks they had been sleeping together , she was n't sure what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing the poppy field in a flood of yellow Earthly sunlight . There was sudden , inappropriate laughter from the back of the mess hall , and Marnie McInnes said , " How did she get out ? " " Flying monkeys ! " a joyful cry from Alicia Clifton . Ernst 's teeth gleamed in the flickerlight . Both had returned to a world in which it was all right to be a child . " Damn ! " The veterinarian 's curse cut through the laughter . Someone triggered a handlamp , and there was a scream , and a cry of " Turn on the damned lights , somebody . We 've got a problem ! " Mary Ann was out of her chair before the lights came up . She worked her way to the back of the hall . A circle of people had formed around one of the calves , and as the light strengthened , she could see that the poor thing was wobbling , barely able to stand . Blood drained down its legs , and skin hung from its ribs in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and staggered , almost collapsing into her arms , smearing her with water and blood . A scream split the driving sound of the rain : " The fence is down ! " and lights all over the camp blinked to life . Coats were grabbed , and rain hats . Mary Ann ran out into the mud and the bleeding sky , pulling on her coat as she went . They moved across the compound in a broken wave , running north to the grazing grounds . She splashed through puddles , slipped in mud , blinded by the rain . There was a scream to the left : " I found another one . " She saw Jean Patterson struggling with a weak , terrified calf , wrestling it to the ground . Mary Ann wiped the rain out of her face , tilted her head against the wind and , panting , headed for the swarm of handlamps buzzing around the fence . The wire was broken . It was ripped away from the posts , almost as if a jeep had been driven through it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corral was empty . Desperately , in confusion , she began looking for tracks , spoor , anything . She recognized the wild laugh that came to her lips for the hysteria it was . In this rain , a herd of mastodons could have tromped through , and there simply would n't be any trace . Cadmann was already at the shelter and stirring at the ground . A flash of lightning revealed a mass of blood and tissue working between his fingers . He grimaced in disgust . " No dog did this . " There were more yells , as more of the calves were found staggering in the darkness , braying into the wind . Zack puffed hard as he ran up . " What happened here , Weyland ? " " Hell if I know , and I do n't think we 're going to find out until morning , either . " " Take the calves over to the horse corral . They 'll keep . " Zack bent , looked at the metal . The sheeting looked as if it had been ripped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something like this ? " Cadmann shook his head , but when he looked up at Mary Ann , there was both concern and vindication in his frown , a mixture that made her feel uneasy . " What happened here ? " Zack whispered again . " I can tell you what happened , " Terry said . Mary Ann whipped her head around at the ugly tone of his voice . " What happened is that someone 's been predicting trouble , and now we 've got it . Happy , Weyland ? " Mary Ann wanted to spit in his face , ashamed that someone had  | spoken aloud the words she was whispering to herself . Instead , she balled up her hands and shouted , " Just go to hell , Terry ! " " To hear your boyfriend tell it , we already have . " Then he turned , walking away into the rain . Mary Ann knelt beside Cadmann , putting her arm around his shoulders . He was shaking .  | THE SKEETER autogyro hummed up from the bank of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its shielded tail rotors beat a curtain of dust from the ground . Tau Ceti crawled towards the western mountains , a tiny glare-point momentarily eclipsed by the tarpaulined shape swinging from the belly of the gyro . Zack Moscowitz shielded his eyes against the glare with one hand , with the other held the veterinary clinic 's door open . Sylvia Faulkner and Jerry Bryce emerged running . The doctor kept ahead of the dust cloud . He waved the Skeeter along the approach corridor between the animal pens and the shops . Jerry must have come straight from his bed . His eyes were puffy ; his unruly brown hair looked like the brambles that circled the plain . Sylvia wondered if he would be able to handle tonight 's work . " Where 'd they find Ginger ? " Zack coughed dust , hawked and spat . Sylvia flinched . That kind of rudeness was totally out of character for Zack . " Half a kilometer upriver . Barney spotted it on his third flyby. "  | The Skeeter 's engine whined , laboring as it hovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ton of cargo . The calf 's remains shuddered on the nylon palate as it spooled down , until palate and corpse flattened against an aluminum gurney . Sylvia and Jerry wheeled the gurney into the clinic . The bulge beneath the tarp was not the shape of a calf . This was n't going to be fun . Stamping feet thundered in the horse pens as the colts and fillies backed as far away as they could . They tossed their manes , snorting , nostrils flaring . Zack sympathized totally . " No , it does n't smell pretty , does it ? " He stood back as the cart was wheeled up the ramp into the clinic . Sylvia guided , Jerry pushed . " I still ca n't believe this is happening . " He eased the door shut behind them . Jerry took the cart the rest of the way in . Sylvia watched as the Skeeter dipped toward the western wall of brambles . " We have n't found anything on the infrared ? " " Nothing but turkeys and pterodons , " Zack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . Nothing on visual , nothing on audio , nothing on infrared or radar . For a hundred square kilometers . " He wagged his head in disgust . " I do n't know what to think . If there 's something out there , it means trouble . But if there is n't anything out there . . . did you say who found this ? " " Carr . " " Yes , right . May I ? " She handed Zack the clipboard and he jotted a note to himself . His handwriting , neurotically neat at the best of times , looked machine-printed . Sylvia took his arm affectionately . " Zack  --  do n't try to be everywhere at once . We 'll take care of this . " He started to protest , and she turned his chin , examining his bloodshot eyes . " You get any sleep ? " " Usually I count sheep . You would n't believe what was vaulting the fence last night ? " Jerry peeled back the outer tarp . " Sheez ! " Sylvia moved back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet and suncooked and corrupt : the kind of odor that conjures an image of hungry flies and heavy spices ; the smell that permeates a back-street butcher shop on a warm summer afternoon . Zack was trying to back out of the room , but the sight and moist sound as the tarp was peeled away held him transfixed . As the last layer of cloth left the corpse , he grunted in disgust and turned his head . One of the calf 's legs was gone . Another was broken , chewed almost completely through , hanging at an angle . A hideously raw wound  | gaped in the center of the body . Skin and muscle had been ripped away , ribs snipped cleanly or shattered , jagged edges jutting through the flesh . The bones were grooved and splintered as if something had tried to push Ginger sideways through a wheat thresher . Mamie hooked a gauze mask around her ears . " All right , Jerry , start the camera . " Her voice had a lisp that turned " Jerry " to Sherry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the ceiling . " Cassandra . Program . Autopsy assistant . Run . " A glowing crystal at the end of a gooseneck extension snaked down from the ceiling . The video camera paused patiently as Jerry adjusted a collar at the top of its neck . Its red eye winked on . " Okay . Program is running . Recorders on . Go , Marnie . " Marnie wheeled over the tray of instruments and pulled on rubber gloves . The stomach wound swallowed her arms to the elbow . " I note puncture marks around the throat without further damage inflicted there . Buttocks and abdominal muscle removed . I suggest that death was caused by severing of the jugular and carotids , but that the attacker dragged his prey to safety , and there consumed the , ah , missing tissue and internal organs . " Her delivery was precise enough to compensate for much of the mushiness of her lisp . Years from now this would be seen all over the Earth . " The bones are neatly sheared  --  almost too neatly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " Her husband came to her side and pulled on a pair of plastic gloves . " Sylvia , " he said quickly . " Get on the console and follow us with the camera . " The glowing crystal wound its way to Marnie 's shoulder and perched there , peering . " What have you got ? " " Just a moment . " Sylvia fiddled with the controls : suddenly the abdominal wound was floating in front of her , in living color . Her own stomach rolled , and she leached some of the color from the video stage . Little of this would be seen by Earth 's billions . Too much blood . Maybe there was an underground market ? Jerry 's hand walked into the image , pointing at a rib that had n't been ripped away . His scarecrow body moved smoothly now , in familiar habit patterns . " We have bite marks here ? " His fingers traced several notches . " I want a projection based on bite radius , jaw pressure and overall strength . Whatever killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm not doing anything useful , " Zack said . " I 'm going over to  | Control to check the infrared returns . " No one answered . " I just hope to hell something has come up . " As soon as he was out of the room , Marnie looked up . " Nothing yet ? Not a flicker ? " Sylvia shook her head . " Nothing . Not one of the Skeeters has picked up anything larger than a turkey . " " And Cadmann 's still out there looking ? " " First out , last back . You know Madman Weyland . " The torn flesh disappeared from the video stage , replaced by a two-dimensional column of numbers . Sylvia turned to the computer monitor . " Cassandra . Imaging . " As she talked her words and numbers were transformed into lines of color . She manipulated them with an optical pencil until they became teeth and a crude mandible . Mamie exchanged terse words with her husband . They looked at the wounds and the luminous outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tried to shut down their imaginations . They were not entirely successful . GINGER had yielded up the last of her secrets , and lay quiet now , refolded within her shroud of waterproofed canvas . The operating room reeked of disinfectant and strong coffee . They sipped coffee while they examined the video image . A disembodied brace of teeth without muscle or flesh floated in the air , grinning , mocking their confusion . " I come up with something like a hyena 's jaw , more teeth , broader bones . " Sylvia 's finger traced the jawline . " Not strong enough , " Jerry sighed . " Remember the way the ribs were sheared . Cleanly . I ca n't think of anything strong enough ? " " ? to cut those bones ? " Marnie shook her head . " We 're not talking strength here . There are plenty of animals who have the strength . It 's the pressure I ca n't believe . " The camera hummed . " So much force concentrated in such a small area . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leviathan body , peanut head . " She drained her cup , clattering it down on the counter . " And I do n't believe that , either . " " Do n't believe what ? " Sylvia was staring at those jaws . The teeth would be like shears , and unbelievably powerful . She shuddered . " I do n't believe a carnivore the size of a rhino with the speed of a leopard . " Marnie threw her hands into the air . " I 'm sorry ! There 's just nothing that size on the island . " " Maybe it swam over , " Sylvia said in a small voice .  | " But there 's nothing here now . " " Maybe it swam back . " Jerry stared at the image for a long moment , then shook his head uneasily . " We 'd better hope to hell that that 's just exactly what it did . " THE PTERODON beat its leathery brown wings in slow motion , craning its claw-hammer head to skaw displeasure at the humming , hovering intruder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of its natural caution , spiraling closer and closer to the thing , trying to decide if it posed a threat . Suddenly the bulbous head of the intruder erupted in light , turning dusk into midday , burning brighter than Tau Ceti at its height . Blinded , the pterodon cawed and reversed its arc , heading for the safety of its nest , high in the crags of Mucking Great Mountain . Cadmann chuckled and wiggled the searchlight toggle , playing the Skeeter 's beams around the pond at the base of the mountain . It scanned clear , except for a few samlon near the surface . Nothing large had been near it recently : the infrared would pick up a man-sized heat trace half an hour old . Fed by trickles of snow melt and a tributary from the southern highlands , the pond was the largest body of still water for fifty square kilometers . If there was a large carnivore in the vicinity , surely it knew of this watering hole . Perhaps it even fished for samlon here ... . The pond stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dead black in the center . The water shivered as he brought the Skeeter down for a closer look . " How deep are you , fella ? ? " Before the thought could congeal , his earphones buzzed . Cadmann cleared his throat into the microphone . " Weyland here . Found any-thing ? " It was Zack on the other end . " Not a thing , Cad . You ? " " Not yet , but ? " " We need to have Town meeting tonight . Head on in . " " I 've still got a quadrant to sweep . " Cadmann could almost hear Zack counting under his breath . " Cadmann  --  you 've already swept your entire area twice . Everyone else is in . We 've been at this all day . We need to talk , and nobody wants to wait any longer . " " But ? " " I 'm too tired to play martinet , Cad . Do me a favor and just come back in . " The pond stared at him . Something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Skeeter around for a long look at the plateau . The brambles were struggling for a foothold on the square kilometer of naked rock , and Cadmann saw that yes , a trap could . . . Suddenly he was smiling as he climbed , spun the Skeeter around and dived toward the lights of the Colony . THERE WERE no colorful newsreels or densely worded technical briefs displayed on the walls of the communal meal hall . There were no sharp , tangy vegetable smells , and no warm buzz of camaraderie . A low mutter of disgust tinged with fear wound its way through the group as they faced the floating image of the dead calf , its wounds marked with flashing green labels . Mary Ann gripped Cadmann 's hand : her nails bit into his palm every time the camera zoomed in on a wound , until he carefully disengaged her hand and put it firmly in her lap . At the head table , Zack paused in his comments to take a drink . It seemed to brace him . Cadmann wondered what exactly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he concluded , rather apologetically . " Sylvia extrapolated this from the spread and depth of the bite marks . We have an eighteen-centimeter jaw base , and a roughly wedgeshaped head . It looks like something sired upon a rattlesnake by a bear . " Nobody laughed . " Urn . .. massively strong jawbones and corresponding muscles . " We ca n't be sure how much such an animal would weigh . Certainly enough to destroy any credibility the tracks by the chicken cages might have had . " He peered out into the audience . " I 'm afraid that that incident was a particularly unfunny prank . " Gregory Clifton handed a drowsy April to his wife , Alicia , and stood . " Zack , let 's cut the crap . I worked on the computer map . Half the Colony saw the information as it was coming in . There is n't an adult here who ca n't interpret the technical data for himself . How about opening up the floor ? " The applause shook the room . Zack shrugged , spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your idea ? " " We know about the pterodons . None of them get too large . But maybe there 's another species of flying carnivore . Something the size of ? oh , crap , let 's say a California condor ... "  | There was a quick spate of derisive laughter . Jon Van Don yelled , " What the hell , why not a roc , Greg ? " Barney Can brayed with laughter . " Watch out for flying ele-phants ! " " Wing span-to-weight ratio , Greg , " Stu called . " It would have to be huge to lift a calf . Much larger than a ground carnivore capable of bringing down the same size prey . And how would it evade the Skee-ters ? " Greg held up his hand . " Hear me out . It would n't need to fly away with the calf . It could fly in , and then drag a heavy victim to a safe place . And maybe it nests up in Mucking Great Mountain ? " There was a shout from the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black man from the engineering crew , stood . He was fighting a losing battle with an evil grin . " I say our mistake is thinking it had to be big . Maybe it 's not an it . Maybe it 's a them , like a herd of Marabunta army mice ? " " Something like a glassfish , " Jean Patterson added . " A super-cha-meleon ? " " It has to be coldblooded , to evade the infrared ? " " The hell it does ! There 're hot springs everywhere you look ! " The opinions were flying too thick to stop now , and Zack sat back , pleased and relieved by the healthy creative energy being released . La Donna Stewart stood , tiny fists poised lightly on her hips . " Has anybody considered a borer ? " " I think we 're listening to one  --  Ow ! " There was the sound of an affectionately brisk slap as she whacked her fiance , Elliot , and the room quieted for a moment . " I mean like a mole , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddled with tunnels and we 'd never know it . It could operate like a trapdoor spider . Engineering should put together a seismic detector , Zack .... " Andy whipped out a pad of paper and started making notes to himself . Zack Moscowitz took the opportunity to grasp control again . " A good suggestion , La Donna . All good suggestions ... " He glared at the engineer . " Except maybe the Marabunta mice , Andy . " He touched a switch , and the grotesque skull disappeared from the wall . He chuckled darkly . " I know that some of you do n't even believe in this thing . There is . . one possibility that Rachel suggested to me . As camp psychologist she felt it was time we discussed it openly . "  | He took another sip from the thermos , then plunged ahead , dead serious now . " We all know about Hibernation Instability . It 's no joke to any of us . Personally , I 've noticed that I do n't parse as well as I once did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to do in my head . And I wonder : is that just age ? Or could it be those little ice crystals that were n't supposed to form ? " We 've had major memory losses , impairment of motor skills , mood swings and clinical personality disorders  --  all of which we 've been able to handle by juggling work duty and schedules . A few cases have required chemical stabilization . " The muttering in the room had quieted . They were ahead of him , and heads nodded in anticipatory agreement . " Maybe things have been too placid here . The crops are thriving , we 've had no deaths  --  hell , no real injuries ? " Cadmann looked around him in the dark . A little white lie there , Zack . Ernst walked right of the cliff and broke his ankle his first week down . " Just maybe there are those among us who feel that it 's been too easy , and perhaps for our own good want to ? " His fingers fluttered as he fought for the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our spines stiff , by creating a bogyman . A harmless joke , perhaps , except that the loss of the dog , the chickens and now the calves suggests a rather disturbing trend . " I wo n't suggest that this is what has happened . But I would be remiss to exclude the possibility from this discussion . So . . . if anyone has anything to talk about , please ... " He looked out over the audience , which was dead silent . Zack gripped the edge of the table , his knuckles pale . He moistened his lips nervously . Alicia 's baby started to cry , and she blithely offered it a nipple . Zack cleared his throat uncomfortably . " No one has anything to say ? Carlos ? " Their carpenter/historian shook his head . He peered at his fingernails , inspecting them in the dark . " Not me , amigo . I uh . . . I heard that the tracks by the chicken cage might have been a prank . We all heard Cadmann say that , and I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long moment , then Cadmann stood . His big hands were splayed out on the table in front of him , and his face was grim  --  not a shred of regret or admission or apology there . " I know what I think . I think that we 're wasting our time here , talking about Hibernation Instability . That 's bullshit . I have a good idea of what we 're  | up against here : something that is fast and strong and smarter than a wolf . Smart enough to use the rivers and streams to foil other predators , maybe . At any rate , that 's how it dumps the heat , and why we do n't pick it up on the scans . " There was a murmur of approval , and Cadmann continued . " This thing is checking out our territory one bite at a time . I 'm not trying to alarm anyone , but it 's pretty obvious that our present defensive plans are insufficient . " Terry stood up , brows furrowed petulantly . " We 're using standard procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the situation really warrants . We 're taking people away from other projects . " " I agree , Terry . So let 's not take them away for an indefinite period . I say an aggressive defense could handle this situation in a week . " " Aggressive defense ? " Terry asked , arched eyebrow and tightly pressed lips punctuating the words with sarcasm . " We do n't wait around for this thing to find a hole in our defenses . We set traps . We hunt it down . This is our world . We 're masters of this island , damn it , and I for one do n't have much stomach for just hiding behind a fence . " " And we can guess who 'd like to play Great White Hunter . " Terry turned to look at Zack , but he was still talking to Cadmann . His voice was calm and measured , as if speaking to a child . " There 's no call to jump the gun . We need to evaluate the situation carefully . See how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can make a coordinated sweep of the island . There 's no need to turn this into a safari . Especially since , as Rachel has suggested  --  there may not be an exterior threat to this colony . " He turned back to Cadmann . " Before you get your back up , no , I 'm not accusing you or your friends . " He flickered an eye at Ernst . " But it would n't shock me if you wish I had . There are some people who need a fight to feel alive . Who feel old and useless without one . " He sat down , leaving Cadmann the only man standing in the room . There was a disgusted ripple of whispers , and Carlos 's barely audible voice stage-whispering , " What a crock . " Cadmann closed his eyes and told his bunched stomach muscles to relax . " Listen to us . The only thing we can agree on is that something is happening here . I say that until proven otherwise , we make the simplest assumption  --  that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaded its territory . Now if you put me in charge of a small group of hunters , I can ? "  | Zack shook his head . " This has all happened too quickly , Cadmann . Until we evaluate the information further , we simply ca n't judge the relative merits of our defensive options . " " Spoken like an accountant , " Carolyn McAndrews said stridently . Cadmann glared at her . " This is between me and Zack , lady . Button it . " Zack blew air . " This is uncalled for . Both of you , cool down . For the time being , I think we should sit tight , on our home ground . After all ? " Zack smiled ? " this camp is our territory . Let 's make it come to us , all right ? " " Damn it ! " Cadmann was yelling now , and frustrated with himself for doing it . " I demand the establishment of a militia , and I 'm going to organize it . I 'm better suited than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we should wait ? " " Wait ? All right . You hurry up and wait . None of you understand ? " Cadmann bit his lip , sealing off the torrent of words . He turned and stalked out of the hall . Behind him , Ernst stood . Silent , impassive as a golem carved from ice . He studied their faces as if memorizing , judging , weighing options somewhere in the crannies of his damaged mind . Then he said , " You should n't treat Cadmann like that . He knows . He 's smart . You should listen to Cadmann . " He followed Cadmann out . When the doors had swung shut behind them , Terry said softly , " I think maybe someone should keep an eye on him . On both of them . " Mary Ann stood , shaking the hair out of her face . Her face was filled with anger , but her voice was little-girl vulnerable . " He just wants to help . " Her voice broke on the last word and she averted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answering his door . She was no stranger here . She had actually left some toiletries on his dresser , and a few items of clothing in his closet . Still she waited for permission before intruding . " Cadmann ? " She hugged her arms to her sides . " It 's cold out here . Ca n't I come in ? " His words were leaden with disgust . " Mary Ann , what do you want ? " That was probably as much of an invitation as she was going to get . She opened the door . The only light was a pale halo surrounding a holographic Earth  | globe , a half-meter sphere of sparkling blue ocean and drifting clouds that revolved above Cadmann 's bed . He was lying on his side , fingers playing with the video control box , bringing silvery dawn or cloaking darkness to the continents . Cadmann stared at the globe moodily . A flicker of his thumb and the western coast of Europe was alight . Another and the globe misted , cleared on a satellite panorama of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video field . A hooked nugget of land near the foot of the island flashed green , and again the globe misted , and the mountains of Wales floated in the air . As if he had done it a thousand times , Cadmann guided the camera in on a southeastern corner , to a valley rampant with golden-green trees and rolling hills , a vast quilt of farmland stretching away into the distance . He laughed flatly , self-consciously . " A sovereign remedy for homesickness , they say . " She sat next to him and reached for his hand . He lay back , kicking his feet up onto the blankets , not bothering to take off his shoes . His shirt was open halfway down the great corded barrel of his chest ; wisps of silver hair reflected the spreading light . Her urge was to bury herself against him . There was a movement in the corner of the room , and she saw Ernst 's enormous bulk perched on an incongruously tiny stool . He watched her expressionlessly , and seemed to her like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into gear . A less flattering metaphor , one having to do with tame dogs , came to mind . She repressed it and smiled at him , still unnerved by his lack of response . " My grandfather came from Wye Valley , " Cadmann said quietly . " It does n't look like this anymore . " There was resignation in his voice , and he hit a button on his control . Once again the Earth globe spun slowly above his bed , segueing from day to night to day in steady rhythm . " Well , " Cadmann said finally . " Nobody can say I did n't try it their way . Mary Ann reached out to touch him again , gratified when he took her hand . His fingers were cool and stiff , and she had the distinct impression that the contact was more for her benefit than his . " What do you mean by that ? " The barest trace of a smile flickered on Cadmann 's lips and then died . " Just ... what I said . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanned the island from one side to the other . "  | A line of shadow fell on Cadmann 's face as the holo globe revolved , and night fell on the Americas . " Cadmann ? " There was no answer . She rose from the bed unsteadily and crossed to Ernst . He looked at her incuriously . The angle of his head only changed as she knelt beside him and took one of his huge callused hands in hers . " Ernst , " she whispered to him . " Please  --  leave us alone for a while ? " " Oh . . . " He grinned childishly . " You want make rub with Cadmann ? That fun . " His ice-blue eyes clouded for a moment as if searching lost memories . " You make rub with Ernst once . I remember ! On ship . Maybe sometime ? " He blinked , as if something sad had suddenly occurred to him , some flash of understanding that was intensely , profoundly depressing , and the great craggy expanse of his face went slack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He resurrected a smile for Mary Ann . " Goodnight , May-ree . " Mary Ann followed him to the door , and latched it behind him . She turned quietly , watching Cadmann 's motionless figure on the waterbed . She sat on the bed and took off his shoes . Dawn broke over a miniature Asia : the Himalayas glittered , flamed white . The China Sea was a riot of warm blue diamonds . SHE WAS riding his hips . She saw the sudden delighted surprise in his face , and he said , " Earth mother . " She did n't know what he meant , or care . Only afterward did she guess how she must have looked , her face and shoulders glowing within the globe of the Earth . Like all of the times and all of the ways that she had made love to Cadmann , this time was utterly precious to her . If there was a barrier between them , it was n't the disdain that she felt from Marty , who laughed to his friends as he knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available Joe , who knew her weaknesses so well . Who rapped on her window when his pregnant wife was asleep . It was different because she knew there would come a moment when he would smile as she kissed him , and then they would laugh together . The barrier would crumble for a while , a fragile crystalline moment , and Cadmann would really be with her , caring for her and letting her fill his needs . And when that time came she turned her face away , unwilling for him to see the dampness on her cheeks .  | Later , long enough later for any tears to have dried and any tremors to have ceased , he held her softly , as if afraid that she might shatter . Gazing at her , he ran his thick blunt fingers over and around the curves and shadows , touching , soothing . Finally he sighed , laid his head gently between her breasts and fell into a deep , soundless sleep .  | IT DID N'T MATTER a damn that the stars above Carlos 's head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Earth . It did n't matter that the wind carried the ticklish scent of alien blossoms , or that the plants beneath his feet were mingled Terran and Avalonian grasses . Beneath the smiling face of a con man , the quick and nimble fingers of a carpenter and the mind of a superb historian , there lurked the soul of a farmer . Like it or not , Carlos felt absurdly at peace . He ran his gloved fingers above the electrified wire  --  without touching . The wire was connected to power leads and pressure sensors . Any attempt to climb over , push under or break through it would trigger a shock : the more pressure exerted , the greater the voltage would grow , terminating in enough electricity to barbecue anything on the short side of a rhino . Huckleberry , the year old gray-brown German shepherd on the end of Carlos 's leash , had learned to be quietly respectful of the wire . fie could stand within two feet of it without flinching but would venture no closer . d ,  | The wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the living quarters , running west near the main road , curving south past the animal hospital , the machine shop and the air pad . There it met the cliff again , stopping shy of the fields . There were more calf pens across the main road , these fenced separately , each enclosed in another " graduated " electric fence . Huckleberry sniffed the cages as they turned west towards the cliff edge , the fifty-meter drop behind the camp that led to the sluggish waters of the Miskatonic . " Hey ! " He threw an arm over his face as a wandering searchlight temporarily blinded him . " Cual es su problema , eh ? " With an apologetic bobble , the searchlight glided on its way . Lamps and video cameras had been mounted on the communal dining hall , the roof of the machine shop and a corner of the animal pens . There was barely a centimeter of the camp that their glaring ovals did not flare into momentary day . Saucers of light skimmed along the road , circling , dipping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter . Suddenly he felt a chill , and the heat-reflective windbreaker did n't help at all . This cold blossomed within him . Silhouettes dimmed the window of the yellow Quonset hut next to the air pad . He watched enviously . In the communications shack there would be coffee and companionship and hot crullers , things he could n't expect for another forty minutes . Huck whined as footsteps approached , and Carlos 's attack of hunger died instantly . He squared his shoulders and put a little more pep in his step . At least I can look like a sentry ! " Terry . " He smiled . The dark softened a malicious grin . Terry looked fatigued and disgusted . His face , never plump , was drawn even thinner , and he looked as if he thought Cadmann was boffing Sylvia while he walked patrol . Terry fished a pack of cigarettes out of his vest and offered one to Carlos . " Just the thing , amigo . " They stood for a time , savoring Earthgrown tobacco . " Might as well enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke in the darkness . The mist and the night formed a wall that obliterated everything more than a kilometer from the camp . Their entire universe consisted of a few buildings and pens and fields and the pale , silent glow of the moons above them . " It 'll be a long time before anyone gets around to planting tobacco . "  | " You may have discovered the real reason I came , " Carlos said contentedly , smoke trickling from his nose . " The only way I could ever quit these damned things is to get ten trillion miles away from the nearest convenience store . " " Yeah . " Terry 's smile was tentative . " You know , amigo , you look about ten years younger when you let yourself go . " Terry was grinning now , but covered it with his hand as he took another drag on his cigarette . " Think we 're wasting our time out here ? " A shrug . " Maybe . A couple of nights should tell the tale . Your wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be sure ? I mean really sure ? " Terry inhaled deeply . " On a night like this it 's nice to have an excuse to be outside . " The grin was open now , and infectious . " You 're right . Thanks , Carlos . " He adjusted the rifle on his shoulder . " Got to keep moving . Another butt ? " The searchlight cruised back through the fields . As it passed the pens , the colts and fillies froze their nervous motions , moist eyes glistening like frozen flames . Huckleberry growled , then subsided . " We 'll have the infrared up tomorrow night , " Carlos said quietly . " Got a jiggle along the southern fence . Not enough to trigger the electricity , though . May not have been anything at all , but . " " Could have been a turkey , " Terry said hopefully . " Si . . . except Bobbi told me that she 's seen damned few turkeys in the last week . Maybe they ran into something poisonous . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Thanksgiving on Avalon ? " The yowl of a bobcat caught in the gears of a clock could have been no more sudden or piercing . The fence alarm hammered at the night , at their ears , stripping the haze from their speculations in an instant . Another sound was mixed into it : an animal sound , something wet and angry . Carlos 's arm wrenched at the shoulder socket as Huckleberry spun on the end of the leash , running north for the Armory . " Jesus Christ ! " Terry screamed , lowering his rifle to port arms , and running behind them . The searchlights swept along the fence , which was vibrating wildly . A ragged chorus of howls split the air as the other dogs converged on the wire . Carlos was gasping , the sudden exertion burning his lungs , a silent litany of Dios mio , let it be a turkey . Por favor , let it be a turkey  --  He  | stumbled , lost his grip on Huckleberry . Before he could catch the leash , the animal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing to be seen , nothing heard except the dreadful screeching . Huckleberry was charging full tilt , snarling his challenge as if he could see something , smell something that Carlos could not . Charging directly at the fence  --  and with dreadful certainty Carlos knew the dog would not stop in time . " Cut the powerrr ! " he screamed , but there was no time , and in the darkness , in the frenzy , Huckleberry leaped directly into the triple strands of the fence . His fur shot up away from his body like needles in a spray of cactus . His startled , agonized yelp was cut short by the hideous sound and smell of meat singeing in the fire . Sparks sizzled whitely from the relays as the section shorted . Huckleberry 's body twitched and leaped like a frog on a griddle . Carlos turned away , choking as his dinner jolted sourly from his stomach . He swallowed hard , forcing it back down , gagging . No hurry now . After a few moments his vision cleared . Huckleberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionlessly now . Jon van Don cut the power . Elliot Falkland pried the blackened , smoking corpse loose with a shovel . The surviving dogs were howling , sniffing , frightened . The stench of death was gut-wrenchingly strong , and a couple of the other colonists had turned away , covering their faces . Lights were coming up all over the camp , and everything was confusion and the patter of feet . Zack was there , skidding on his heels , and then covering his nose . " What happened here ? Carlos ? " " Alarm . Huckleberry went nuts . I think that he smelled something . He tore his way  --  hell , I let him go . He ran right into the fence . God , I 'm sorry , Zack . " " No time for that . Did you see anything ? " There was another sound now , the sound of a motor coughing to life , then purring smoothly . Rotors engaging . A dust cloud swirled up behind the animal hospital as a Skeeter rose from the air pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun to follow . Light sheathed the craft in silver . The Skeeter wobbled , off balance . There was a weight beneath its belly : a calf dangling in a sling at the end of a four-meter line . The animal wiggled feebly . Its legs and head hung with woeful vulnerability as the Skeeter corrected itself and buzzed off to the north .  | " Shit fire , " Zack moaned . " ? and save the ammunition , " Carlos muttered , shielding his eyes as they tracked the Skeeter . " I wonder who that is ? " Terry was right behind them , hands gripping the rifle . " I 'll give you two guesses . Weyland and his tame ape , that 's who . " " What is going on here ! ? " Zack yelled , running for the communications shack . " Will someone tell me what is happening ? " " I 'm sure someone can , " Terry said in disgust . Carlos had the distinct impression that Terry wanted nothing so much as to sight his rifle on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mist . " I 'm damned sure that somebody knows exactly what is going on . " THE CREATURE was curious and hungry , but mostly curious . There was often enough to eat , but never enough to learn , since the invaders came . Their mobile nests with the hard shells , the odd animals that shared their domain .. . Its short lifetime had offered too little to stimulate its senses . Strangeness exerted a fascination . In the murky racial past there had been challenges , lethal unless understood . The threats were long gone , but the curiosity remained . The invaders seemed to have captured tiny pieces of the sun and moons , and could make them shine where they wished . It could not grasp how this could be so , could not even form the proper questions , and so the wondering died before it was truly born . Only a trace remained , in healthy caution and a driving urge to learn more . Caution was virtually no inhibition at all . It could see their weakness : they were slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were merely interesting meat . Still , there was something ... . It crawled around the edge of the encampment , rounding the hill to the southwest , a hill that glittered with shiny squares . It bit one of them experimentally . The square was hard and tasteless and moist with dew . The creature headed west around the fields , past the blowing wheat and corn , past a smaller field planted with soybeans , around to the edge of the calf pen . It had been here once before , during the rain , and had been well rewarded for its efforts . It was about to taste the fence when one of the circles of light glided its way . It scampered to the side , almost directly into a second  | glaring oval , and scampered backward for a few steps , staying in the darkness , playing hide-and-seek with it , while speed began to fizz in its veins . There was always a corridor of darkness to squeeze through , and the game was irresistible . It wiggled across the road toward the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it was across the fence from the horse pen . It watched them , paying little attention to the lights now , the patterns of movement absorbed so that it automatically moved enough to stay out of them . That game was too simple now . There was another , better game at hand . The horses paced nervously now , staring out into the darkness as their noses scented what their eyes could not see . It prowled around to the side , watching the horses . They moved quickly . Their skin was glossy and rich . The way their hair tossed with their fear was almost unendurably appetizing . It whined , its hunger assuming the proportions of lust , and sniffed at the fence . There was something wrong here , it could tell . Its nostrils burned a little to sniff it . Something wrong , but the danger meant less with every passing moment . It wanted one of the horses , wanted to bring one down , to outrun it , to leap upon it and break its neck , to rip open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes in the moment of death ... . Its teeth met the wire . Every muscle in its body locked in unyielding contraction as electricity ripped through the line . It bit down so hard that the wire snapped . It jerked free , screaming its fear into the night . The captured sun surged after it . It ran , terrified of the vine that bit back , of the light , of things that it did not , could not understand . And a thing inside its body flared to life . From a sack behind the peculiarly flattened lungs , a complex chemical pumped into its system . Its blood vessels swelled . Speed surged through its body . Its movements , already quick , accelerated as if a supercharger had been triggered . Its stubby legs churned at blur-speed as its heartbeat tripled . The searchlights that swiveled frantically after it never had a chance . It was overheating , burning as it ran , and as it plunged into the waters of the Miskatonic its skin nearly sizzled . It lay there , marinating in mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed , steadied , calmed . The chemical fire in its body faded slowly to ashes . The fear and pain gradually faded , leaving a core of rage . Anger at the invaders who had n't the good grace to be either prey or direct corn- petitor . The invaders were rivals , and they were cheats ! They were something that it did not understand at all , something that could hurt it in a way that it had never experienced pain , inspire a fear that was quite new to it . One of their flying things came humming overhead , lights stabbing out and dissolving the swirling gray mist . The creature watched through the muddy water , blinking hatefully , fearfully . It worked its way back upriver ; its thick , reptilian body rippled slowly behind . Blood was in its mouth , and murder on its mind . Murder , not killing . Killing was for food or fun . This was an urge to hurt for the sake of hurting . Not to reduce their numbers , but to make them afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their gift of pain . How , though ? How to get in ? It had looked everywhere , and everywhere that it looked were the hard , tasteless firevines which bit back . Everywhere except .. . Above the river , up along the lip of the cliff , above the straight seventy-degree rise that the colonists had considered a natural barrier , there was no fence . Its eyes narrowed as it considered . This was it , then . It would crawl up the cliff and give them fear , and death . It would teach them ... . Stubby legs lifted it from the river muck , and it began crawling up the cliff . The first few meters were easy , but the farther it climbed , the steeper the wall became , until its feet lost purchase , and it slid back down into the water . It lay there , disgusted , and then trotted a few meters to the right and tried again . Stealthily now . Eyes narrowed , one foot carefully finding support , and then another . The purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in layers , offering shelves for toeholds . The creature 's heart beat faster as it considered the havoc it would wreak . It climbed higher this time , and when it started to slide , it fell a clean eight feet before its claws found purchase . It reached the water in a shower of rocks . It seethed with rage now . Muscles flamed , eyesight blurred with red . Again its body began to boil . Its breath seemed to sear its throat . All thought , all considerations vanished in a burst of chemical speed . It erupted out of the water , heart thundering in its chest , legs paddling crazily . There was brush , then naked shattered rock , then a flat rock face . Its momentum was so great that when the footing was gone it  | skimmed up the cliff face , momentum carrying it over places where there were no footholds at all . Its speed carried it up over the edge . Feet scrabbled for support that was n't there . In a moment of utter panic it realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip of the gorge in a great arc , spread-eagled for the captured suns . No sun swung its way . The slanted roof of a hut rose up to meet it : its thick , scaled body slammed down , bumped over the rows of ceramic tiles to the edge and thumped ignominiously to the ground . For a second it lay there , dazed and confused . Then as its wits returned it ran for the nearest shadows and crouched , breath whistling in its throat . After a few minutes , the panic and surprise subsided . It was inside , and could do what it wanted . From the shadows it watched the invaders scurrying about carrying shiny sticks in their forelegs , scuttling this way and that in slow , comical confusion . It was quite funny , and in the shadows , the creature 's thick lips curled in a dolphin smile . The glaring circle of the searchlight cruised past it several times . Once , reflected from a metal tower , the light slid directly over it . But there was no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . . . It listened carefully , heard nothing approaching in the darkness , and crept out , peering both ways . It passed the nearest hut . The door cracked open and it scampered back to a shadow and watched as two invaders scrambled clumsily past , reminding the creature of swimmers in their mindless haste . When they were gone it crept out again , racing from shadow to shadow . The cliff ascent had made it hot and hungry . The Miskatonic could cool it , but there were matters to settle before it took the plunge . It paused in a shadow . Across the way was a patch of light , and it could see into the interior of one of the buildings . There was nothing of interest until a door opened and an invader came in , carrying something small and pinkish in its forelegs . With obvious tenderness the yellow-topped invader laid its tiny burden into a nest made of rigid twigs , and bent to lick the tiny thing 's face , very gently . The invader 's foreleg brushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invader left the room .  | The creature waited another minute , then crept up to the open space , planning to crawl through and take the tender , wiggling morsel . To its surprise the clear space was blocked . It tried again , gently , and Still it could n't get through , but now it was close enough to see that what blocked its path was somewhat like the cold , hard water that sometimes slid down the mountain into its pool . The clear barrier even gave slightly under its weight , and the creature could hear sounds through it . " ? duty again , Alicia ? Well , at least April is asleep . " Uncomprehending , it shook its head and tested the barrier again . There were more sounds , sounds of objects falling , creaking , and it watched the small invader in the nest wiggle , its tiny hindlegs thrusting at the covering . The creature nosed against the barrier again , then reared back and smashed into it . The barrier splintered , sharp fragments slicing into its nose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took one step toward the small nest when the larger invader threw the door open and screamed piercingly . Their eyes met , and the creature thought that it had never seen anything more appetizing . With regret it conceded that this was not the time for the large one . A shrug of its hindquarters brought its great spiked tail back and around to smash into the invader 's midsection . The invader curled in on itself ; its noise stopped . The creature shrugged its tail again . The invader flew away and smashed into the wall . Her forelegs pawed at her torso , trying to staunch the flow of crimsons . She slid to the ground . No time now . Only moments had passed , but it could feel the danger . With a twist of its thick , powerful body it was back to the nest of straight twigs , and the small invader even now squalling its fear . The creature reached in and picked it up . It was so small , so helpless . So like a swimmer . Invaders killed swimmers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a primordial cairn , a titanic mass of unweathered rock stacked as if by Neolithic ritual , towering , raw-edged , lost in the clouds that shrouded the plateau . There was almost no vegetation on the mountain , nothing but moss and a little scrub brush that withered out and died within a hundred meters of its base . Pterodons lived up there somewhere , but on this night they slipped invisibly through the mist or huddled in their nests , rough gray wings enfolding the leathery eggs of their young . The plateau itself was only a few hundred meters wide , fuzzed with brush , and walled at the northern end by thorn-tree brambles . A failed stand of larger trees formed a rough deadfall at the far southern end : the soil had never been rich , and the trees  --  gnarled , spiky growths full of knotted fiber  --  had died before their maturity , too weak to resist the first onslaught of natural parasites . Now the ubiquitous thorn brush fed on the tangled debris . A few tough , rubbery plants surrounded the artesian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was insufficient moss or lichen to break down the rock , and most of the plateau was barren . Barren , and deserted  --  except for two men and a single frightened calf . Cadmann Weyland adjusted a bowline knot around the smooth white curve of its neck , then tugged on the line to check the anchoring : it was securely spiked into the rock . The calf licked his hand , tried to run a warm pink tongue wetly over his face . Cadmann pulled away guiltily . The calf dropped its head and lowed in misery . " Sorry about this , Joshua . " He scratched it behind one speckled ear . In its eyes shone the pitiful gratitude of a retarded child given a rubber bonbon . Cadmann felt dirty . He pulled his jacket tighter and peered up into the mist . It was deeper than even two hours before , masking the starlight , blanketing the twin moons . Thirty meters distant , on the eastern side of the plateau , was the half-completed blind he and Ernst had constructed . The big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the rock with sharp powerful hammer blows , cutting and dragging sections of thorn bush , binding them into place and meticulously adjusting the spiny walls into camouflage position . Thorns gouged needle points through Cadmann 's glove as he helped Ernst haul one last gnarled section into place . " Ouch ! " The big German turned , grinned lopsidedly . " Thorns sharp , hey ? I bring lots of band-aids . " " Sylvia swears these things are harmless . " He grunted , pulling off his glove . The tip of the thorn had broken off under the skin , and would take tweezers to work free . No time now . The calf brayed miserably . Ernst clucked sympathetically . " Poor Joshua scared . We shoot , you shoot good and straight . Kill wolf . We take calf home . " " So it can grow up to be a cheeseburger . Some consolation . " " Cad  --  man ? " " Oh , nothing . On Earth I 'd stake that calf out for a mountain lion without a second thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In comparison with whatever 's been pruning our flock , that calf 's my second cousin . It just does n't feel quite right . " Cadmann scanned their blind , the wall of thorn that hemmed them in on three sides . The Skeeter was hidden in the rock niche behind  | them , invisible from above or the sides . The blind was n't perfect , but it would have to do . The wire grid rectangle of their heater sputtered with flame as Cadmann squatted in front of it . The night was colder than he had realized : the waves of heat eased the tension in his back and shoulders . He unsnapped his rifle case and lifted free his most prized possession . It was a Webley semiautomatic express rifle . Its high-energy , mushrooming .44 slugs delivered a staggering load of hydrostatic shock . The Webley had been thoroughly checked out back at the camp , but he reexamined it now . Cadmann had a simple credo that had served him well over the years : when the game is charging full blast , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick grit out of the trigger housing . He adjusted his infrared goggles and switched them on , peering at Ernst . The big German was a blotch of orangish light in the middle of a blue field . When Ernst moved , the warm air trailing him left an ocher trace image . Cadmann reassembled his rifle and checked Ernst 's , while his friend tied the last thorn section onto hinges of looped cord and tested its mobility . Satisfied , he lashed it into place . Ernst folded his legs and sat , long face quiet . " And we are just about ready , " Cadmann said brusquely . " Here . " He handed the second rifle to Ernst . Something happened to Ernst 's face when the rifle touched his hands . It was as if a little light went on , as though the touch of the wood-grain stock or the smooth metal of the barrel stimulated neural connections that had been unaffected by the cryosleep . Muscle memory . Tactile as opposed to visual or auditory cues . He works well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out some kind of occupational therapy for Ernst based on manual skills . . . . Their heater died . Ernst leaned his rifle against the thorn barrier and reached around into his backpack for a new tubular cartridge of jellied fuel . He slid it into the heater , and tiny blue flames sprang to life . The flare of light from the goggles was a shade too bright . Cadmann adjusted the light level and again examined the plateau . There was very little to see : only the ghostly outlines of the rock , and the glowing red silhouette of the calf . It gazed forlornly at the barrier , then turned to sip  | nervously at the waterhole . It stopped , pawing at the ground , gazing into its depths . It moaned . There was nothing left to do but wait . CiADMANN was humming contentedly to himself , and then the humming turned into words that he was startled to remember : I Blas Gogerddan heb dy dad Fy mab erglyw f y lief Dos yn dy of i faes y gad Ac ymladd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fam It golli'th waed fel dwfr Neu agor drws i gorff f y dewr Na derbyn bachgen llwfr . . He sang in a soft , unmelodic tone . As he continued , the rust flaked off his vocal chords , and he began to find notes with something other than shotgun precision . " Cad  --  man . What you sing ? Do n't know those words . " " Oh , oh  --  damn , I 'm sorry . The song 's in Old Welsh , Ernst . My grandfather taught it to me when I was a pup . Guess I 've never quite forgotten it . A man named Geiriog scribbled it down , and Granddad liked it . " Cadmann closed his eyes and chuckled . " He would . ' Blood and 11 honor , Cad , That 's what life is about . What a man is made of ' ... " Ernst nodded silently , and Cadmann was embarrassed to find himself wondering if the big German could understand . " The song is called I 41 ' Blas Gogerddan , ' or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroll and closed his eyes . " It takes place during a great battle , when one of the warriors bolts and tries to hide behind his mother 's skirts . She 's not exactly a peacemonger . The best I ever translated the song went : Into the hall alone , my son ? Now hear your mother 's prayer . Go back onto the battlefield And aid your father there . I 'd far prefer your blood be spilled Like water on the ground Or have you in your shroud arrayed Than as a coward found .  | Go thou into the hall and see The portraits of your sires . The eyes of each and every one Alight with raging fires . Not mine the son who would disgrace His family 's name and home . " Kiss me , my mother dear , " he said , She did and he was gone . He has come back unto the door , No longer does he live . His mother cries , " My son , my son ! Oh God , can you forgive ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers run through Wales Far better is the hero 's death Than life when courage fails ... The silence following the song was total , and it took a few moments for Cadmann to realize how deeply into the song he had wandered . The words still resonated in his mind , now carried by the rough , untutored tones of his grandfather . That 's what a man is made of .. . " Do you like that ? " he asked , almost shyly . " I like , Cad . I like song . You teach it to Ernst . Soon . " An unstrained chuckle bubbled up through the embarrassment , as Cadmann realized that he felt more comfortable than he had in a hundred and twenty years . At least . " You know , there 's something I 've always wondered . " He paused , his thoughts interrupted by the soft plaintive moans of the calf . " How many of those songs do they sing as entertainment , and how many are behavioral mod ? I mean  --  my grandfather would never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a live coward , but the message was pretty clear . " He shook his head irritably . There was a tension headache in there somewhere , but it had n't wormed to the surface yet . " It sure as hell was . And the worst part of it is that I do n't even know what I think of that . " He stared into the heater . It was a poor substitute for a campfire , and he felt vaguely discontented . He made a fist , examining it in the dim light . His skin was the same tough , weathered hide it had been since his late twenties . A faint smile : Let 's have a big hand for the oldest , strongest fingers on Avalon .  | Absently he caressed the stock of the rifle , running his thumbnail into the engraved hardwood . With sudden , disturbing clarity he realized that he had never touched Mary Ann more lovingly . He grimaced . " Maybe I do know what I think about that . Sometimes you just have to he satisfied with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and gripped Cadmann 's arm warmly . Together they waited . RELATIONSHIPS . There is a relationship between hunters , between hunter and prey , between a hunter and his own body , his aches and pains and fears . Between a hunter and time itself . They mingle , this complex set of interrelationships which varies in every case , and within a single hunt varies from instant to instant . But whatever the variables , there is one thing that remains con-stant : There comes a moment in which time ceases to have meaning , when aches and pains and fears dissolve into insignificance . When friendship or antagonism , hesitation or eagerness all meld together to create an instant of pure feeling , clear intention , when the observed and the observer are one . At this moment the mixture of awareness and involvement is like a supersaturated solution : one vibration , one degree 's variance of temperature triggers irrevocable change , a shockingly abrupt crystallization of potentials . Cadmann and Ernst , cradling their rifles , gazing out into the darkness , existed in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calf , its occasional whines all absorbed into the gestalt of the experience . Waiting without wanting . Preparedness without hope . Empty vessels , delicate balances awaiting a trigger . Joshua the calf strained at his tether , pulling toward the northern edge of the plateau . He was staring out into the darkness to the south , eyes huge and shiny , all sound stuck in his throat like a chunk of frozen grass . He reminded Cadmann of nothing so much as a deer transfixed by the headlights of an oncoming jeep . For just one moment the tableau was stable . Then the calf tried to bolt . It strained at the tether , pulled until the plastic line was as taut as a bowstring : vibrating , singing against the spike in the ground .  | " Do n't see anything . . . " Cadmann whispered . " Where ? 7 " Ernst nudged his elbow , and pointed south . Cadmann 's goggles whirred noiselessly as they adjusted for range . Gradually it came into focus : a faint blotch of orange beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly changed from an indistinct blob to a real shape : oblong , rear portion low to the ground , upper body more erect . " Komodo dragon , " Cadmann said into the tiny tape recorder in his pocket . " Komodo dragon , but the tail 's thicker . Head 's rounder . It can walk bipedal but does n't much . Uses the short front legs to get over the brush . " Jesus Christ . The bastard must weigh two hundred kilos , easy . " The calf strained against the noose until he was gagging . His swollen tongue bulged from his mouth . The legs were as rigid as iron pipes , and the eyes protruded whitely , rimmed with red . The thing stalked out of the south . It waddled toward them , toward the trembling calf , moving with confident slowness , stopping for a moment to survey the plateau , even pausing to stare at the blind . " It knows we 're here , " Cadmann dictated . " Knows and does n't give a damn . Christ , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , it thinks . Well , maybe not . " Well insulated . Not giving off much heat . Hard to get details . " Cadmann cursed and turned his goggles up another notch . The creature paused for another leisurely look at the blind , then turned away to move toward the calf again . Its infrared glow was like a will-o ' - the- wisp gliding across the land . Cadmann grinned . Gotcha . I do n't know what you are , but we 're sure as shit going to find out . " Do n't shoot until I do , " he whispered . " Aye aye , Colonel . " Was Ernst remembering ? No time to think of that . Wait . Come on , baby , come on , further from the edge , out onto the plateau . I do n't know what you 're made of , but ten rounds of this ought to finish you . " Parasites , " Ernst whispered . " Careful . And maybe it has young ? " " Good thinking . " Parasites . Like fleas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've killed it . He is remembering . Adrenaline ? The creature had moved closer . Come on , come on .. . The creature was within fifteen meters of the calf . It continued slowly , paused often to sweep its head around . " I think it can see in the IR , " Cadmann dictated . " Probably sees us better than we see it . "  | The calf was bleeding from the neck as the nylon braids rubbed and cut , but adrenaline drove him on . Just an instant now The thing moved like a boneless crocodile , each step , though apparently clumsy , rippling back through its body like rhythm through the legs of a millipede . It was hypnotic to watch , and now that he could see it more clearly , he could see and sense the raw animal power of the thing . " It 's smart . As smart as a dolphin , maybe . Give it enough time , it might evolve intelligence . " He felt a fleeting moment of sadness . Then the tether snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ernst fired first . Cadmann let the rifle swing easily to follow the creature and squeezed off a round . As he did , the creature moved again . Cadmann 's shot went wide of the mark . " Jesus , it moves fast , " Cadmann shouted . Ernst fired again . The creature 's body was slammed by the first shell , and suddenly it was moving . It whirled and dashed toward the blind , moving at an impossible speed across the rocky plateau . Shock piled upon shock . The infrared goggles flared as if a thermite bomb had ignited in the creature 's bowels . The rangefinders could n't adjust fast enough as the creature dashed toward them . Its image remained out of focus but flared until he saw nothing but a bright glare . Ernst fired three times more . It was impossible to tell whether he had hit the creature . It screamed , in pain or defiance or challenge , or all three , and it hissed like a steam engine . Suddenly it was upon them . Ernst stood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood-tinged darkness . The dragon hit the thorn barrier . Branches bent , split , splintered . Thorns and bark exploded into the interior as the monster slid sideways into them . It thrashed its tail and a section of the wall fractured and slammed into Cadmann . He fell . Spikes pierced his face and hands and legs . A flying broken branch struck the left side of his head and knocked the goggles askew . Cadmann tried to stand , but one knee did n't want to work properly . A thorn branch hung from his left hand . He had to set the rifle down to tear it free . Blood followed the thorns . Less than five seconds had passed since the first shot . The creature screamed again . The thorn branches flew again as it lashed its tail . Cadmann tore away the useless goggles . There was blood in his eyes , and he fumbled for his rifle . Everything seemed to happen at once . To his right Ernst was firing wildly at something that tore through the thorn barrier as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorn branches flew as deadly missiles .  | Cadmann 's left hand did n't want to work . Blood streamed from the palm , and lifting his rifle was agony . Ernst fired once more . The creature screamed , whether in agony or rage Cadmann could n't tell . It seemed to take forever to bring the big rifle around , and then Ernst was in the way . More blood flowed into Cadmann 's eyes from the scalp wound . " Get back ! " Cadmann screamed . " Back ! " Everything was moving in slow motion  --  everything except the monster . Its speed was impossible , and Cadmann 's mind , in a vain attempt to grasp the thing 's rhythm , had slowed reality down until he seemed to be swimming in clear syrup . His thoughts slugged along like a holo played at one tenth speed . Too many impressions per second , too many feelings , too much surprise . Too much of anything and everything , until his entire nervous system was in overload , and for an instant nothing registered but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great tail lashed back and forth . Each time it struck branches and splinters flew at them . It knows , Cadmann thought . My God , it knows ! The barrier fence crumbled to nothing . The world was a blur . There just was n't enough light . His left eye was blood-blinded , useless , and his right was n't in much better shape . Exactly eight seconds after the first shot was fired , the thorn barrier was a mass of splintered ruin . Faster than a cheetah ever ran , than a cobra ever struck , something that was all dark mouth and glistening teeth wiggled through the opening , and Ernst screamed . It was a sound that Cadmann knew he would never , could never , forget  --  all of a man 's hope vanishing in one overwhelming moment of agony . The monster 's head jutted through the jagged opening . The jaws clamped savagely into Ernst 's thigh . Arterial blood spurted . Ernst thrashed and flailed . His arms flopped like a rag doll 's . He struck at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mallet fists that made no more impression than snowflakes on an anvil . The jaws snapped again , clamping more deeply . The scream arced higher , wavered , began to fade . The monster backed out of the hole , dragging Ernst with it . Cadmann was watching himself watch , the distance between thought and action expanding until he felt like a man falling down a well , sky and sun and rationality impossibly far above him , growing fur- ther with every hundredth of a second . With immense effort he fought his way past the paralysis and forced himself to act . Outside now , Ernst was still whimpering as the thing crawled up his body , looking into his eyes . Its paws were locked onto his front shoulders , huge face so close that it looked as if it might kiss him . Ernst 's own blood drizzled out of its mouth and onto his cheek . Ernst turned to Cadmann , something beyond fear or pain in his face , only a pleading silence that was shattered by a single urgent word : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : at the creature , at Ernst , at the night , as logic dissolved and terror coursed through his body like electrical sparks arcing from pole to pole . And Ernst exploded . The gas cartridges ! A bright nimbus of flame played around the bodies , and Cadmann shielded his eyes . The creature howled its wrath and pain as a fireball of jellied fuel engulfed the rough wet leather of its squatly amphibian body . It reared back , shrieking , turned and ran . To Cadmann it seemed to fly downhill like a meteor or a rocket missile : one long stream of fire ending at the pool . It skimmed across the surface of the pool , then sank almost in the center . Its agonized howl ended suddenly . The flame went out . The pool smoked and steamed like a caldron of soup . A trail of fiery webbed footprints , improbably far apart , sputtered for a few moments and died . Cadmann pushed his foot at the thorn barrier . An entire section of it simply fell to the ground . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flailed at Ernst 's flaming , smoking corpse . The heavy nylon was melting , burning his hands , but he continued beating at the corpse mechanically , ignoring the pain that was beginning to surface , until the last flickering tongue had died . Ernst 's body was charred and broken and chewed , barely recognizable as anything that had ever been human . Cadmann knelt by it , breathing deeply to stave off shock . His entire left side felt like raw meat . Ernst stared at him , through him . Cadmann reached out trembling fingers to close the eyes , but there were no eyelids , nothing but singed , smoking , crinkled black flesh , flesh dark as any African 's , flesh black as coal with pinkish-red pulp showing through a few cracks . Cadmann turned to the side and was suddenly , violently ill.  | " SKEETER THREE , this is home base . Do you copy ? " Zack listened to the answering crackle of static , and cursed under his breath . Standing close behind him , Sylvia Faulkner held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs unsteady , her belly feel swollen and tender . The entire colony was in a barely contained state of panic . There would be little sleep tonight , and a heavy demand for stimulants and mood stabilizers before morning . Zack was holding up well , but his eyes were frightened . Sylvia 's body cried out for somewhere dark and warm to curl up and sleep , just dream the nightmare away . But she had done it : she had held herself under control while she examined Alicia 's corpse and identified the bloodstains left smeared in an empty , broken cradle . The aborted rescue party had only worsened the situation . Too many of the men had families now , wives and children that they were  | reluctant to leave . There seemed little reason to march out into the fog , searching for what no one really wanted to find . Gregory Clifton 's haggard face still floated in her memory . The sound of his voice as he begged desperately . Please ? I need your help . Help me find my baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words had trailed away as the sedative took hold . " Skeeter Three , this is home base . Do you copy ? We have you on radar now . Just come on in , Cadmann . " Zack rubbed his hands on his pants . His voice was cracking . " Is Ernst with you ? Do you have the calf ? " Another pause . Sylvia folded her hands , staring down at them disconsolately . " Maybe the radio is broken . " " I hope so , " Zack said miserably . " God , I hope so . I do n't want to go looking for him in the morning . For them . How in the hell did this happen ? " The door clattered open , and the air took a chill as Terry entered the communications shack . His hands clutched at the edges of his windbreaker . " Greg is out now , " he said sharply . " It 's not exactly what you 'd call sleep , but it 's an improvement . We do n't want him up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is coming hack , is n't he ? " Sylvia glared at him . " All right , all right  --  I do n't want a lynching party . Nobody 's calling Weyland a baby-killer . I just want the truth . About now I do n't know what to think . " The fog outside was still a hovering , isolating curtain . In only two hours Tau Ceti would rise and burn much of the mist away . Until then it stifled sound as well as sight and aggravated their sense of dread . Zack rubbed his eyes . " That idiot . He had to go out and get the job done himself . " " He 's an idiot all right , " Terry said . Then , exhaling harshly , he added , " But goddammit , just this once , I hope he was a successful idiot . Christ , poor Alicia . " Sylvia reached out to her husband , gripped Terry 's fingers tightly and pulled him close . Two deaths . Two deaths in a population of less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one swoop , without any explanation , any answers . Perhaps just a series of warnings that they had all been too rational to heed . Everyone except . . .  | " Cadmann . Can you hear me ? " Zack adjusted the microphone 's sensitivity . " Come in , please . " There was a commotion outside , yelling , and through the fog she could hear the beat of the Skeeter 's rotors as they whipped the air . " Thank God , " Zack said fervently . " Weyland . " Leaning on Terry , Sylvia levered herself up out of her seat . " I want to go out , " she said . She expected opposition from Terry , but he just nodded . " Let 's go , " he said . " I guess everyone should be there . " The airpad was directly behind the corn shack , an asphalt-paved square with a target circle painted in white and a ring of landing lights implanted around the edge . Those lights splashed whitely against the belly of the Skeeter , beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended by the fog . Its cargo hoist was empty . Its silver belly pivoted slowly on the axis of its top rotor . A ghost ship bobbing on a sea of air . Rick Erin and Omar Isfahan were trying to wave Cadmann down , motioning with flashlights , talking worriedly into the flat rectangular comcards clipped to their shirt collars . She could hear Zack 's voice over the nearest one , could hear it grow more tense as the hovering Skeeter 's transmitter remained mute . Most of the colony was out now  --  a forest of frightened , weary faces graven with unanswered questions . " Cadmann  --  can you hear me ? Come on down . Come on and land , Cadmann . You must be running on fumes anyway . . . . Come on , Cad . We just want to talk to you . We 've had some trouble down here , and maybe you can help us understand it . Come on down , Cad .... " There was a long pause , and then Sylvia heard Cadmann 's voice . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , " it said . The Skeeter wobbled as if Cadmann was having trouble flying and talking at the same time . " I did n't mean for anything to go wrong . You 've got to understand . There was n't any way that I could have known how fast that thing is . There w  --  was n't any w  --  way I could have known . " Terry 's eyes narrowed as a low mutter swept the crowd . " What the hell happened to him ? " A million possibilities shouted against each other in Sylvia 's mind . She remained silent , afraid that anything she said would make the situation worse . Somehow . " Come on down , Cad . We 'll talk about it . "  | " I ... I 'm coming . " The Skeeter floated down , spinning on the axis of the cockpit , settling to ground like a pale blue feather . At first there was no movement from the Skeeter , just the motionless silhouette in the pilot 's seat . Then the door opened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was burned , scratched and bloodied . His face was chalk , his movements teetering jerkily on the edge of shock . Carlos hurried to his side , tried to help him , but Cadmann waved him away and levered himself up using the Webley like a crutch . " No , " he gasped . " Get . . . Ernst . You 've got to believe now . " The other side of the Skeeter was already being opened . Someone gasped , someone cursed ; several colonists broke for the open air . The stench of burnt flesh hit Sylvia , triggering a fresh wave of nausea . " Let me take that , " Zack said , forcing nonchalance into his voice . He reached for the rifle . Cadmann snatched it away , screaming " No ! Nobody 's taking this from me . " He held it white-knuckle tight against his chest . " You 're scared , are n't you ? Well , it 's about time ! Maybe some of you will stay alive . " He patted the Webley . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Cadmann laughed bitterly . " I 'm not even sure we can stop it . Another hand touched him from behind , and Cadmann wheeled , the butt of his rifle raised to strike . " Get a ? " Mary Ann 's eyes flew wide as the butt stopped inches from her chest . " Cadmann . . . ? " He wiped his hand across his forehead . She reached out a hand , and when he did n't take it , she grabbed him , ignoring his feeble attempts to push her away . " Cadmann , please . . . give me the rifle . " " No . " The pitiful bundle from the passenger seat was unwrapped . Jean Patterson turned away and bent over , gagging hollowly . Hendrick tried to comfort her and she heaved again , staining his pants . Cadmann took a few steps , stumbled , caught himself . He reached out for Mary Ann this time . She sagged under his weight , then pushed with her strong runner 's legs until he was braced against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the monster . It 's big . Bigger than a komodo . Fast , like a racing motorcycle ! Turns better . " Sylvia knelt to look at the corpse . Terry was behind her , peering  | over her shoulder , and hissing in disgust . " Komodo , Weyland ? " he said incredulously . " Shit . It was sure as hell a dragon , anyway . " She had never seen a human body damaged so badly . Cadmann 's eyes met hers , and there was a naked plea in them . Please . You believe now , do n't you ? Do n't you ? " You 're hurt . You 've lost a lot of blood , " she whispered . " We 've got to treat those bums . " " Not yet . No sedatives until you believe me . " He waved one blackened hand weakly . " Go ahead . There 's a tarp on the floor of the Skeeter . In it you 'll find a chunk of that goddamned thing . If you ca n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them away . " Go ahead  --  get it . Take it into the lab and for God 's sake analyze it . " Two of the lab techs unloaded the chopper . The package was bulky and clumsily wrapped and weighed about two kilos . Sylvia did n't want to unwrap it . " All right , Cad , " she said . " Let 's go in and take a look  --  but you come in and sit down . We ca n't afford to lose you . " Zack was watching Cadmann 's eyes carefully , chewing at the corner of his mustache . Carlos pushed his way through to stand next to Sylvia . " Carlos , " Cadmann said weakly , trying to smile . He moved his mouth as if his lips were half frozen . " Amigo . " There was confusion and mistrust mingled in Carlos 's face , and his dark eyes kept straying to Cadmann 's makeshift crutch . " We 've had a lot of trouble here . " Cadmann was having trouble keeping his eyelids high . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several of the colonists had edged almost imperceptibly nearer , and the tension left a metallic taste in Sylvia 's mouth . Something ugly was going to happen . She broke the spell by clearing her throat . " I 'm taking this into the lab . I 'd like you , Zack , and Terry , and Mary Ann and Carlos . Except for lab personnel , I 'd like the rest of you to wait , or go back to bed . There 's nothing more to be done tonight , and we 're going to need clear , rested minds in the morning . " Without another word she turned and entered the lab . She did n't look behind her , did n't want to , because she did n't want Cadmann to see her confusion . No matter what happened here , and what she found out , they had to get the rifle away from him . He was mumbling as Carlos and Mary Ann helped him through the door . " Absolutely . Blew off of it when Ernst 's fuel pack exploded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head woozily . Hysterical laughter was bubbling up through the fatigue . " It got a mouthful all right , a real mouthful , and I wish that I 'd blown its fucking head clean off ? " " Cad ? " " Stay back . " There was still iron in his voice . " Cadmann , " Zack said quietly , watching with eyes that missed nothing , " Alicia is dead . Her baby is gone . " Cadmann said nothing , swallowing hard . " How . . . no . . when ? " " Right after you left . Something got through all of our defenses . Broke through her window . We need your help . But the first thing you 've got to do is to put that rifle down . " Sylvia forced her mind to the table in front of her . There was a raging headache coming on , and it was splitting her attention when she needed it most . The only thing she could do for Cadmann now was prove the truth of his claims . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a chance to take root . He was telling the truth . There simply was n't any other answer . Not even Terry had accused Cadmann of killing Alicia and her baby . There is a big difference between a calf and a human being She sneaked a peek over her shoulder at Cadmann . He was staring at her , eyes dark-rimmed with exhaustion , and she was suddenly afraid . " I 'm cold , " Cadmann giggled almost to himself . " A floating anvil . That 's a nice image . " " Cadmann ? " Sylvia and Mary Ann exchanged looks . " You need rest . " " Not until you look at that sample , damn it . But . . . I 'll go into the veterinary room . I 'll sit down . " Mary Ann , yellow curls flattening against Cadmann 's shirt , his blood staining her nightgown , motioned to Carlos . Together , they helped him into the veterinary clinic and to an examination table . He sat , clutching the rifle . Sylvia turned from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going on with this until you let us start working on you . You do n't want a sedative or anesthetic , fine  --  macho it out . But I 'm damned if you 're going to die on me . " " All right , all right . " Jerry grunted relief and prepared a plasma bottle . Carlos peeled Cadmann 's blackened shirt away from his right arm . Cadmann winced , clutching the rifle more tightly . " You should  | have seen it , " he muttered . " If you could see it , you 'd understand . It 's fast . God , it 's fast . I swear it 's faster than any animal on Earth . Nothing can move that fast , but it did . Be damned if it did n't . " " Come on , Cad , " Mary Ann wheedled . " Put the rifle down for a minute , so that we can get ? " " The hell with that ! " he screamed weakly . " I 'm not letting this out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me ? Dead . " Zack whispered to Jerry just before the veterinarian slipped the needle into Cadmann 's arm , and set the control on the rectangular box of the plasma pump . It hummed gently , sending healing fluid into Cadmann 's veins . " Do n't look at me that way ? " Cadmann 's voice was pleading , slurred and drunken . He tried to raise his head but it seemed monstrously heavy . It thumped back to the table . The rifle slipped in his grasp a little , and he groaned , tightening his grip . " Ernst had a bullet hole in him , Cad . We were hoping you could help us with that . " Cadmann , slipping further toward unconsciousness , did n't really hear the irony in Zack 's voice . " The monster . It was eating him . " He yawned deeply . " Must have hit Ernst . Maybe even tried to . He screamed , Zack . Screamed like a woman . He wanted to die ? " Zack made his move , snatching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , choppy movement drove the butt into Zack 's stomach . Zack staggered back , grunting , face whey-colored . Cadmann tried to roll from the table and stand , but fell heavily , ripping the I.V . from his arm . Dark fluid drained from the needle and dribbled onto the white tile of the clinic floor . He struggled to gain his feet , make it to his knees before Carlos landed on his shoulders , pinning him down . Zack stumbled back in , wresting the rifle away as Cadmann sobbed and collapsed to the floor . " Please . Do n't ... just trying ... " His head sank back to the ground , and he was unconscious . " Jesus Christ , " Carlos whispered , for once his accent forgotten . " What kind of man is he ? How much somazine did you pump into that plasma , Jerry ? " " I did n't want to overdo it . Come on . Help me get him on the table . " Sylvia watched Carlos and Terry tie him down . Terry tightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why so tight , Terry ? "  | " You have n't told us yet , " he said nastily . " Is that a piece of Ernst or is n't it ? " " No . " Sylvia shook her head , more from fatigue than relief . " I 've tried human antigens . It 's not calf meat , it 's not dog . It reacts to all of them . It 's not turkey or chicken , and it 's not catfish . So it 's alien . " " So he killed a pterodon . So what ? " " I 'm tired , Terry . Back off . " Her voice was numb . " Jerry  --  get the liquid nitrogen , would you ? " She tweezed a piece of the meat to a dissection tray , and sliced a quarter-inch piece away . Jerry carried over a ceramic thermos and tipped the lid . The liquid nitrogen , boiling at the touch of room-temperature air , foamed white vapor . Sylvia slipped the sample into the pot . " We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every life form we 've found on this planet . I 'm going to run a gene analysis . It will take about ninety minutes , and we 'll have our answer . Is that all right with you , Terry ? " " Do n't make me out for a villain , " Terry said flatly . " Something terrible just happened here , and I want the truth . " Sylvia removed the frozen section of flesh , and Jerry started up the automated apparatus . A conveyer belt hummed , trundling into a rectangular box of chrome and white enamel . She placed the smoking sample gingerly on its tray , and it disappeared inside . There was a tiny , highpitched hum as the laser saw sliced the meat into specimens only a few cells thick . Cassandra would build a holographic model and then compare it in depth with the others in her memory banks . Then they would know . Sylvia was n't sure that she wanted to . She turned back to the magnascope , to the tissue sample displayed in a quilt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heartbroken . " It could be anything . Pterodon . Samlon . Or something we never even dreamed of . " It may have only been the terrible fatigue , but a tear welled at the bottom of her eye , and she wiped it away harshly . " What are we doing here ? " She snatched the sample tray from under the scope and hurled it across the room . It broke with a tinkle of crystal , and a spatter of clear fluid against the yellow plaster . " Just why the hell did we come ? " " We 're all tired , " Zack said . " It 's going to be a couple of hours before we have answers ? " " Close enough , " Jerry agreed .  | " Then let 's get some rest . Before this is over , we 'll need every bit of it we can get . All right ? " Carlos looked at the wall , at the still form of his friend , strapped now to the table . " What about Cadmann ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearily . " But I know that I 'm too tired and sore to think . I need some rest . He 'll keep . " " Everyone but Jerry out of here , " Sylvia said . " I want to stay . " Mary Ann stood against the wall , her arms folded , eyes fixed on Cadmann . Zack was still massaging his stomach , feeling for bruised ribs . Every few seconds he wheezed in pain . He said , " Carlos , take care of Mary Ann . We need to clear out so that Syl and Jerry can work . " " No , I 'm not ? " Sylvia closed her mind to the sound until she heard the door close behind them . Then she and Jerry methodically stripped Cadmann , sprayed his bums and minor wounds and covered them with gel . When they were done with the hemostats and the dissolving thread and the unguents , they slipped him into a clean smock and refastened the straps . Then they turned out the lights and left . She shivered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think happened out there ? You do n't really think Cadmann did that damage to himself ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know anything right now . We 'll know in a little over an hour . Just let me close my eyes for a few minutes . " Jerry nodded and started back to his cottage , to the dubious , transitory comfort of a warm bed , when Sylvia 's voice stopped him . " I can tell you one thing , Jerry . No matter what we find out , we 're not going to like it . I promise you that there are n't going to be any comforting answers . " " Yeah . " Jerry hunched his shoulders against the chill . He turned to speak again , but Sylvia had already disappeared around a corner , or into the fog , and he was alone .  | IN THE SHADOWS beyond the fence , something watched . Something alive , silent , almost motionless save for the rise and fall of its torn and bleeding flanks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain into territory that was strange indeed . Irreversible changes had taken place in its body . In a distant way , it even understood that it was dying . But first there was an obligation . It hid in the shadowed fields beyond the reach of the searchlights . When it concentrated it could smell the man , the one who had hurt it . This one , whom it had badly underestimated , was the real threat . And every instinct screamed for it to get to him , to find and kill him . It began to wiggle forward . It lay between rows of corn , just a few dozen meters southwest of the colony . The searchlights still swept across the ground , and the men still walked the edge of the camp . How to get past the firevines ? It moaned hungrily . In the next instant the solution presented itself . One of the men  | ran his forepaw along a section of vine . He touched it  --  leaned on it . It recognized the section . This was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed safe now . Perhaps firevines could only bite once . . . . The man was alone and not even looking in its direction . Now . Now , as the searchlights crisscrossed , there was a moment in which darkness was almost total , when shadow licked the fence , the man , and a stretch leading almost to the fields . It moved . It moved as fast as a Skeeter skimming at low altitude , moved so fast that the man at the fence hardly had time to look up , had no time to scream before it hit back into the wall of the veterinary clinic . His head dimpled the sheet metal and rebounded directly into the creature 's flailing spiked tail . It shook the man 's head free of the spikes , let the corpse slide to the ground . It flowed onward , a quarter ton of rippling muscle and bone , black as a shadow , as dark and fluid as the river flowing behind and beneath the bluff , as much a part of the night as the stars or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sniffed tentatively at first , then entered . There was little light inside , but it needed less than it found . Animals were caged along the walls . Curiosity was almost as intense as the pain and resolve , and it stopped for a moment to peer up into one of the cages . A small white shape curled up in the corner , hidden in a mass of wood shavings . The tiny alien stirred slowly , then jerked to wakefulness , staring , blinking its tiny red eyes . The creature had seen that look before , many times before . Total submission . A trembling readiness , the prey 's acknowledgement that it was ready to be food . No running . No fighting , its heart ready to burst before it was ever touched . Not now . The creature could smell the man , and it turned toward the smell . The man lay on a table . He moaned softly , and moved limbs that seemed tangled in short vines . That was just as well . It had no urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , stretching , feeling the hurts in its body , the pain along its sides where it was burned and torn . The long wound in its flank opened again , trickling fluid . It braced itself and tried  | to jump up onto the table . The table was not a boulder . It tilted . The safety blocks on the wheels popped free , and the table skidded across the room , tubes ripping free of the man 's forelimb , dark fluid spraying as they crashed into the wall and the table flipped onto its side . As the table thudded to the floor , the man 's eyes fluttered open . Their eyes met . Here it was . Here was the moment it craved . Here was the moment when the hunger and the pain and the anger vanished , and it saw into those eyes as down a deep , chill waterhole , a bottomless grotto . The man 's eyes grew wide , wide enough to sink in , to swim in . The creature drew closer . This was the deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It pawed experimentally , raking away flesh . Blood streamed from pinkish pulp beneath . The man grimaced , showed his teeth . Small teeth , flat and harmless . The man was so weak ! and yet he had hurt it as nothing else in its short life . The man was at the moment of death , his limbs bound , drawing back as far as he could , shrinking against the table , but his eyes held nothing of submission . His sluggish muscles struggled in the bonds . So much had changed so quickly in its life . And this one Man had been at the center of so much of it . End it now . But his eyes . They met its own so steadily . Helpless , bound , about to die  --  and yet .. . And yet . . . There was a scream from outside , and a sound of pounding feet . Its attention was split by confusion and uncertainty . It turned back to the man and saw triumph in his eyes , and it knew that somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its life was over . Pain bit into the back of its head , and it spun as a second bullet missed it by inches . It charged directly at the man holding a long stick which spat fire . It felt another , awful pain , and then it was on him , his head in its mouth . There was a moment of bony resistance to its jaw muscles , then splintering collapse and softness . It spat him out and rushed for the door . If it could reach the river . . . But the doorway was crowded with men and their firesticks . It howled its agony , reversed directions , flailing its tail at them , feeling the pain bite deep until the thing in its body triggered , and the entire world seemed made of blood . It exploded in the other direction . There were more of the vinelike  | things , and small metal objects . Strange smells filled the room as liquids spilled . The walls of this cave were thin , and bulged when the tail struck them . Instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something ripped open . An entire corner fell away . Outside was night , and the chance to find the river , to shed the heat that was cooking it from inside . One man blocked its way , and it slammed its tail into him , the spikes piercing his leg . It could n't shake him loose ! He screamed and screamed , confusing and slowing it , even with speed raging in its body and fire raging in its mind . Another flick of the tail smashed him against the corner of a building . It pulled its spikes free , leaving him leaking and moaning on the ground . But the men were everywhere now , and it ran this way and that , plowing into them , its body spasming , out of control now , blind with the blood in its eyes .  | SOUNDS . . . Someone screaming . A shot ? Sylvia groped her way up from a dream that clung like a moist membrane . The bubble of groggy sleep thinned as she wavered near wakefulness . Tactile : Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft swell of his stomach against her backbone as they nestled like spoons . Visual : Darkness . Outside , filtered by the drapes , a dim light glowed . Searchlight 's glow . All was well . Auditory : The heavy , liquid sound of Terry 's snoring . Nothing new or unusual there . Sleep yawned , beckoned . No . Wrong thought , wrong time . Her eyes fought to focus in the dark , to find the clock . How long had she slept ? Was it time to get up again ? ? Another sharp crack of sound , unmistakably a shot . A searchlight  | briefly lit the drapes . From all around the camp came shouted inquiries , groggy at first , then alarmed . She lurched up in bed , throat scratchy with sleep , groping out for the reassuring warmth and protection of her clothing . " Terry . Terry ? " " Mmmph . Fug . " Terry rolled onto his stomach , surprised when her body was n't there to support him . His arm flopped out . " Huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants . Terry 's fingers stretched out gratingly , and brushed one of her nipples . A wave of desire warmed her , startled her with its strength . Terry , you pick the damnedest times . She shut that part of her mind down and focused on the window , on the wildly swinging lights that filtered in through the drapes . Terry came fully awake as Sylvia slipped on her shoes . " What fool 's raising the roof now ? " " I do n't know . It 's by the animal pens , and ? " And the veterinary clinic . " Cadmann , " she whispered . A volley of shots . Terry virtually levitated from the bed . " What in the hell ? ? " There was screaming now . " Hurry up . " She paused just long enough to be sure that he was rolling out of bed , then ran for the courtyard . The huts were generally divided into two sections , sleeping and living . Although the communal dining halls were used by all , many ? most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to entertain friends . The space that she shared with Terry was small and might have been considered cozy , a place of warmth and She crossed the courtyard and stopped in horror . Figures backed out of the clinic . They were shrouded in darkness and fog that swirled like milk in thin tea . Four stylized shadows , posed  --  four generic riflemen . They fired into the doorway . Something within was screaming and shaking the building like a rat caught in a milk carton , screaming with such energized venom that for a moment she was frozen in her tracks . She made herself move . A row of garden tools leaned neatly against one of the huts and Sylvia snatched one in a two-handed death grip . She circled the bungalow , seeking a glimpse within . No room in the doorway . Thank God ! But she had to get closer . She recognized one of the riflemen . " Carolyn ! What is it ? " There was no answer . Carolyn McAndrews and her companions  | fired wildly , fired without targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal walls of the veterinary clinic . There were sounds of shattering glass from three buildings away . " For God 's sake , what 's hap-pening ? " Colonists poured into the main boulevard outside the clinic . Robes and pajama bottoms still being pulled on , bare chests and legs or fully armed and dressed perimeter guards , they sprouted out of the darkness . Steps pounded behind her . Terry grabbed her arm . " What ? ? " The metal wall of the veterinary shack cracked wide . Something screamed . The sound locked every muscle in her body . They 're not crazy at all , she thought , and , It 's come . The crowd scattered as the metal sheeting peeled back farther , distended , and something black smashed through the opening . Terry 's grip was like a vise . " Oh migod . He was right ? ! " " Cadmann ! " Sylvia tore free from her husband . He caught her again and pulled her back as the creature bounded into the crowd . Death was alive in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a specter to be buried with Alicia and the bloodied scraps of swaddling . It was alive , and glistening , and it moved among them like a demon of muscle and scale and teeth . It moved too quickly for Sylvia to get a distinct picture . Dark ! Too damned dark ! And the searchlights swiveling to cover it were woefully inadequate , jerking spastically around the yard . For a moment the monster was halted by a ring of colonists with sticks and guns . It stood at bay against the shattered remains of the veterinary-clinic wall . Handlamps , then the searchlight from the watchtower swung toward it . Sylvia saw eyes the size of oranges with huge black pupils . In the same moment those pupils closed to pinpoints . It hissed . Blood sprayed from a dozen wounds that ranged from neat punctures to raw craters , a red brighter than arterial blood . The massive tail smashed at the sheet metal . The screams smashed at the ears . For just that instant it was contained , and then The pupils opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved . Sylvia gasped . A good racing car might have accelerated that fast . Terry pulled hard on her arm and they were both falling backward as the monster smashed through the line . Two good men flew away like dry leaves in an autumn whirlwind , and one kicked Terry across the forehead as he flew over , all before Sylvia hit the ground . She crawled behind a huge reel of insulated wire . The great tail swung . There were spikes on the end  --  and Barney 9  | Carr flopped helplessly along the ground , spiked through the leg , as the monster whipped this way and that . Barney 's head cracked into the corner of a building ; his face disappeared in a smear of blood . The creature shook him loose and he lay still , only his hands clenching and unclenching spastically . Zack Moscowitz appeared from the shadows to stand over Barney . Tears streamed from his eyes . " Damn you ! " he screamed . The creature turned . Terry staggered up , muttered , " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked an iron rod from a stack of fence stakes leaning against a shed . He glanced back at Sylvia , just one frightened flicker of his eyes . " Terry ? " He turned away , turned to stand between hell and his wife and unborn daughter . " Terry ! " He was already part of the melee . The creature was big , larger than a large crocodile , and built like a tank : compact , invulnerable . It should n't have been fast  --  but , wounded and bleeding , it moved faster than anything ever bred on Earth . It leaped from the circle . Armed colonists ran to surround it . Others fired when they could see nobody behind it . Even as they ran it moved again , and again , so that they could n't surround it . Sylvia had never seen , never heard of anything that could move like that : streaking across the dirt , losing its balance and skidding to a stop ; waiting , then blurring aside from a scattered volley of bullets . Move , stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move again ? Thank God that it seemed more interested in escape than destruction , but even as it thrashed blindly it left death behind . Red silk kimono and pale blond hair flagging behind her , Jean Patterson ran for her life . Before she could reach the safety of her hut she met the flailing spikes of the monster 's tail . Her truncated scream was a barking sound in the night , and she skidded and flopped along the ground to crumple close by Sylvia 's concealing coil of wire . " Jean ! " She stared up blindly , her head twisted far around . Too far . The spine was crushed . Dr. Patterson thrashed without feeling . Jon van Don ran to intercept the monster and haplessly blocked its way as it fled toward the road . Instantly the monster was on him . It crushed him to the ground and left him behind , but its claws had pierced and dug , ripped through jacket and pajamas and skin , snapped  | bone and drove jagged ribs into lungs . The searchlight slid over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . His screams never stopped . Sylvia clapped her hands over her ears and squeezed her eyes shut . It was n't enough . She could n't shut out the sounds and flashes of light : the shots , the screams , the slap of feet , and finally , the wave of heat that tore her from her cocoon . She could n't help it , she peered through her fingers Greg . Somehow he had roused himself from drug-induced slumber . He staggered , legs mere rubber , but his face was a mask of rage as he advanced on the creature . On his back , slung skewed with only one of its shoulder straps buckled down , was one of the flame throwers that had been used to burn the bramble bushes from the plain . Its nozzle spewed a twenty-foot stream of liquid hell . Flame licked at the monster 's bloody hide , and it reared in shock . He was shouting something . She could n't really hear his words over the roar of the flames , the human sounds of anguish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew : Greg was screaming obscenities , the things she would be saying if her own wife and child Husband ? " Terry ? " She could n't see him , but there were bodies everywhere , people crawling and sobbing , and the B-movie monster skittering around the quad trying to find a way back to the darkness  --  the river ? ? its tail to the power shed now . It hissed as Greg advanced . It sat there for a moment , and then with the speed of a flea jumping from a complete standstill , it leaped at Greg . Greg did n't even flinch , too far gone with grief and rage to care . A tongue of flame lanced out and met the thing in midair with a horrific whoosh ! that stole the dark and chill from the night . It hit the thing squarely , in one eye-searing moment converting it into a thrashing blur of fire . But that was n't what saved Greg . Sylvia had seen the creature 's bullet-tom hind leg collapse as it leaped . It was sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped in front of him , burning , motionless . It was dead . It had to be dead  --  nothing could possibly survive the bullets , the fire  --  and Greg sent a steady tongue of flame licking into it . Flame rolled up from its body and exploded against the shack behind it , jellied gasoline spattering everywhere . Then it moved . Without any warning sign at all the damned corpse  | was moving again . George Merriot leaped away , too slowly ; the creature brushed him and he was aflame . The burning man thrashed on the ground , arms flopping , trying to put out the jellied gasoline sticking to his jacket and pants . Rachel Moscowitz was battering at him with a blanket . Bobby Erin whipped off his robe and slapped it onto George , totally unconcerned by his own resulting nudity . All eyes were on the monster . The monster had gained twenty meters toward the river cliff in the blink of an eye , and once again was motionless . The smell of fuel and burnt flesh boiled up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . Its tail was a sudden blur , and then an impossible living fireball streaked for the river , fifteen good meters this time . Through the smoke and flame she could see its head wagging slowly , agonizingly , as if trying to orient itself . Its tail lashed mindlessly . Greg followed , firing the flame thrower not in bursts but in a single continuous stream . He laughed and cried hysterically , unmindful of the havoc he was wrecking . " You  --  stay still  --  Alicia  --  you ? " Firing the flame thrower at the tail had the same effect as firing it at a spinning propeller : a blur , a thin , curdled mist of flame . Buildings were afire all around them . Stu Ellington , his moon face ruddy with fear and adrenaline exhaustion , cried , " God 's sake , Greg , put it out ! Put the damned thing out ! The animal 's dead ! " Stu shouldered a rifle , aiming not at the dying thing wrapped in a web of flame , but at Greg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear the order , but the flamethrower tanks spat out their last breath of fire and were empty . Trembling , Stu lowered the barrel to the ground . " You , die , die , damn you , die ? " Sylvia was startled to hear her own voice , hear herself chanting , not knowing when she had started it , knowing only an intensely morbid fascination with the thing that It moved , and this last leap took it over the edge of the bluff . It did n't even scream as it fell . " Get it ! " Zack bawled instantly . " Do n't let it get away . " Colonists ran toward fires and the injured . Zack grabbed randomly . " Jill . Harry . Ricky  --  no , Jesus , get some drawers on . Mits . Get a steel net on that thing 's body . It 's almost dead , but do n't take any chances and do n't let the body wash away . " Sylvia pulled herself erect . Something had bruised her ankle . She  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something ? Smoke and blood and the stench of cooking monster flesh filled the air . A dozen bodies lay scattered and bleeding . Jean Patterson broken and twisted and still at last . Jon van Don , Sylvia 's next-door neighbor , his face a mask of blood , fumbled with numbing fingers to stanch wounds across his midsection . Scenes from newsreels , from long-past wars on Earth . Sylvia wandered blindly through hell . " Terry ! " He must be all right . He must be helping to put out the fires Flames grew everywhere . Tanks spat white foam into the wreckage . A thin current of wailing was an incessant background to her every thought . Broken glass and wood and plastic crunched under her every step , and Sylvia was losing it , tottering on the brink of overload . We had time . We should have been ready . We should have known . Cadmann warned Cadmann . Cadmann 's still in the clinic ! She was running before she knew it . One slipper flew off , and the bare pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one at the door of the infirmary , and at first she thought that it was empty . Then she saw Mary Ann and Carlos hunched over Cadmann . Cadmann was n't moving . Blood oozed from a dozen wounds . She fought to get in next to him . Mary Ann turned and glared at her . " We can take care of this , " she said , and her voice was frigid . " He warned you , damn you . God damn you to hell . He trusted you . And you tried to kill him . Go on . I 'm sure that your husband needs you somewhere . " Carlos 's dark face was sliced along the chin , a wound that oozed blood onto his green sleeveless shirt . She reached out to touch him . He spoke without turning . " No . It 's all right . Why do n't you get a first-aid kit and see who needs help ? " He did n't try to smile , but there was no hostility in his face . " Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Ann 's fingers tenderly probed his wounds . Sylvia backed out of the room , grabbing the first-aid kit as she went , mumbling , " I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I tried ? " But no one was listening to her anymore . THERE WAS SO much damage  --  everywhere . Her emotions were in such a snarl that it was impossible to find a loose end , somewhere she could begin to unravel . She counted the blanket-draped figures that she could see . At least  | four corpses . Three times that many wounded , and some would be dead by morning . She walked stiff-legged and numb , desperate to find a way to make herself useful . Terry . She heard his voice to the left , barking orders . He was working with three other men to quell a blaze roaring in one of the storage sheds . Her mind was n't working . She was n't thinking clearly , and she wanted to , badly . What did they store in that shed ? What . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Terry ! " He turned . " Sylvia ! Get back ! " The sheer ferocity and alarm in his voice took her by such surprise that she did back up , and then she was off her feet , feeling the wall of air before she saw the light or heard the sound . The shed behind Terry mushroomed into a fireball , and the men with him screamed , twitching like moths caught in a Bunsen burner . The edge of the fireball lifted Terry and flipped him into a stack of tools where he lay , clothes smoldering , as the camp burned ... . IMPRESSIONS : Blackened faces , bandages . Wisps of smoke rising from twisted alloy support struts . A sky gray with ash , a dawn welcomed with low , despairing moans . Wars must look like this , Sylvia thought . Cadmann would know The communal dining hall was smoke-damaged but otherwise unharmed . Now it held most of the Colony , excluding those too badly wounded to be moved . There was little sound in the room save the few mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the sense of relief from those who had come through the ordeal with hides and families intact . The unwounded . There are n't any unwounded . We 've all been hurt . Sylvia thought . A fragment of song came to her . Sometimes I feel like a motherless child . A long way from home . " Mary Ann ? " Mary Ann paused in her endless rounds among the wounded . " Is Cadmann ? ? " " He 's alive . " " Do n't go ! Terry . Where is Terry ? " Mary Ann 's mouth was a grim line . " He 'll live . I think . " " Live ? " " Maybe . I have to go . You 're not hurt . You 're all right . So is your baby . "  | Sylvia let that thought sink in . The baby is all right . . . . Another shadow fell across her . Zack wandered aimlessly through the room with a bullhorn , counting the wounded , trying to get a feel for the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolyn McAndrews followed him , a sallow wraith at Zack 's heels . Zack climbed onto a dining table and raised his bullhorn . " I do n't know what to say . " He paused . There was silence . " We . . . we have more than enough medicine and bandages . " The bullhorn bellowed his voice : gravelly , ruined by an endless night of screaming . " If there are any bite victims that I am presently unaware of , please . . . " He wavered , losing focus , and Rachel steadied him . Sylvia felt herself coughing , watched herself raise an unsteady hand . " Zack  --  what do we do now ? What do we do about the defenses ? " " Full alert , of course , we activate the mine field . The electric fences . But ? Goddamn it , Sylvia , you know that thing was impossible ! Impossible ! We could n't have expected that . It 's a fluke . Nothing that large can live on this island , the ecology ca n't support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that yourself ! It swam over from the mainland , it must have , and how could I have known it could do that ? " He wiped his forehead with a grimy hand . His voice cracked . " There just is n't enough food to support it . " " It got here , did n't it ? " Ida van Don screamed . Her face was chalk , except for the smear of blood on the left side of her face . " It got ? " She could n't get the rest out , and buckled over with sobs . Phyllis draped a blanket over her shoulders . " Not enough food , " Sylvia said . She tried unsuccessfully to hold back her own tears . " Yes , I said that . All right , Zack , it was n't your fault ! Is that what you want on your tombstone ? It was n't your fault ? Zack , it could n't be , it should n't be , but it 's here , and you ca n't know there are n't more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Mary Ann would have a suggestion . " Carlos 's voice was dry and carefully controlled . Zack 's lips drew taut . His hands shook . Rachel took the microphone . Her voice was as raw as her husband 's . " Is that a suggestion or a demand , Carlos ? " " Neither . Not yet , anyway . " " Then we need n't worry about it yet . Sylvia , all serious suggestions are welcome . We know we need more security . Please , all of you , be assured that until the entire situation has stabilized , no aspect of security will be neglected . But we have to start somewhere  --  right now , we have  | to make sure that a total inventory of the damage and losses is made , and that all of the wounds are dealt with . Yes  --  Andy ? " The engineer stood . His right arm was strapped to his chest . " This was n't supposed to happen . Nothing like this was supposed to happen . I was ... We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender redhead from agriculture , stood . Both of her hands were wrapped in burn gauze . " Dammit , I saw that freaking animal take over a hundred rounds , and half a tank of jellied fuel . It was in the water , and the water smoked . We got a net around it , and its tail was still twitching ! It had to be dead , just spasms  --  but I 'm telling you that it almost killed the three of us . If there had been five of them , they could have killed everyone in the camp . " " Five  --  hell if it would have needed five ! " Ricky shouted . Rachel tried to speak , but despite the microphone she was drowned out in the babble . " One . One more would finish us ! " " Cadmann was right all the time , damn , why did n't we listen to the colonel ? ? " " Ten lightyears , ten years away ? " " Power plant 's finished ? " " Vet shed ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waved his hand . " Enough ! Listen , damn it ! " The babble died away . " Look , we 're not going to get productive work done until we rebuild the camp , and we ca n't do that until our minds are at rest . " " Yeah , sure , relax , " La Donna called . " Good old Zack . No-o-o problems . " " Cut the crap . It does n't help the situation if everyone talks at once . Look , chances are we wo n't find another one of these  --  things . No sense in taking chances , we 'll take precautions , but damn it , science is science . There 's nothing for it to live on here . There wo n't be more of them ? " " How the hell can you know that ? " " There could n't have been that one ? " " Stop ! You 're scientists and engineers , and the best people that could be chosen from a half billion applicants , and God damn it , act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure , we 'll put a study team on the  | problem . Immediately . What do we have that will kill these . . . monsters . . . and do it efficiently ? We 'll find out ! " " I think we need atomic bombs , " Andy said . Two people laughed . Andy sat down again . Zack spoke through pain , pushing his voice when it should have been allowed to rest . " We were n't prepared . Whether we ever run into another of those or not , we 'll soon know what will kill it . One person by himself should be able to do it . We 'll find out . I swear . This is our island , and I 'm not turning it over to any goddamned monster . Ours , do you understand ? " " Right . " Carolyn McAndrews stood and applauded . After several seconds others joined wearily . Sylvia rose and left the room . She walked out through the door , out into the camp , where smoke still rose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stroyed . The power plant looked bad . People dug in the ruins , trying to find valuables or irreplaceables . Here was the hospital . Its normal five beds had been expanded to twenty . Most of the wounds would heal , thank God , but a few , just a ii few ... Terry for instance . Terry lay torpid in a bath of saline solution . Jerry was checking Terry 's wounds as Sylvia came through the door , and his face was grim . " We may have to amputate the right leg . The bones are shattered . " ly She nodded numbly and sat down in a folding chair next to him . Terry was still unconscious , filled with painkillers . His skin was reddish and peeling , as if he had been staked out in the Mojave for days . " He 's lucky to be alive , " Jerry said . " We 're all lucky , " Sylvia said soberly . " Somehow , that does n't make things any easier . " There was one figure conspicuously absent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted desperately to see . Jerry caught the look in her eye . " We moved Cadmann back to his hut . He damned well insisted . He 's taking food there . I do n't know . He 's very weak , but there X41 are others who need help more . He 'll heal ? " Sylvia half stood , but Jerry 's hand tugged at her . " Name of God , Sylvia . You 're not the only one who 's sorry . We screwed up , and we 're paying for it . But you ca n't do any good . How do you think Terry 's going to feel if he wakes up and you 're not here ? Let it be . " She twisted her arm in his hand , and then finally sat back again . Drained . " There is n't anything to be done . "  | " Nothing . We 've got the body out of the river , and as soon as the wounded are stabilized , we 'll be able to spare you . Until then .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is your husband . For God 's sake act like it . " A slap across the face could n't have shocked her more , and she nodded . " I ... I 'm sorry , Jerry . " " Being sorry does n't count for shit . Broken bones do n't care how you feel . They just need to be set . " What time was it ? How long had Jerry been working while she luxuriated in her grief ? It had been twenty hours since the attack . It had probably been two days since Jerry had slept , and he was still going . Shame swept through the depths of her . But in its wake was resolve , and a kind of nervous energy . She stood . " Jerry , thank you . There 's a time for self-pity , and this is n't it . How long has it been since you slept ? " Jerry smiled raggedly , running his hand through a thatch of hair that looked as limp and tired as the rest of him . " Sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " " Get out of here , and do n't come back for at least six hours . Doctor 's orders . " " Are you all right ? " " Now I am . I have to pass the favor on . Scoot . " Jerry took a last look around the infirmary and shuffled off , grabbing his coat on the way out . Sylvia rolled up her sleeves , and touched her stomach gingerly . The baby was fine , she could feel that . If anything had happened . . . But now there was work to be done . A war zone . That was what it looked like in here . A goddamned war zone .  | FOR SYLVIA , the next three days were a stabilizing time , a time of learning who was going to die , and who would live . They lost three more during that time , raising the death toll to twelve . It seemed that none but the dead slept during those days . There just was n't enough painkiller or somazine to keep the wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too easy , and too painful to play . " If onlys " turned wishes into guilty visions , turned thoughts of mine fields and guards and infrared scans into haunted caves , vast cobwebbed torture chambers where her sleep-starved mind whipped and racked her without mercy . She was pregnant , and she could n't deny it or hide it , and so every night when others went back to the hospital after dinner she was driven into bed , and given orders not to show her face until morning . But the guilt and the pain and the sheer stark need drove her on . She saw Zack . He was going harder than she . Perhaps harder than  | anyone . And if she knew that her dreams were pits of despair and selfrecrimination , his were beyond her imagining . Her life during those vital hours was consumed with the wounded ? the burns , the bites and punctures , the broken bones and ruptured internal organs , the cuts , nervous exhaustion , fatigue , shell shock and even a bullet wound . But Zack had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined the damage . The biology lab was almost totally destroyed . The power plant looked wounded , but was in fact dead . The plasma toroid was punctured ; the only replacements within ten lightyears were in the motors of the Minerva vehicles . And in three days , after the worst had passed  --  after all the fences were mended , the first tentative inventory taken and all the medical cases stabilized  --  it was Zack who performed the service at the mass burial . No preachers . We did n't want any . No preachers , no rabbi , no priests . We are the scientists , rational , thoughtful  --  was that wise ? " They died that we might live , " Zack began . She thought of the last funeral she 'd attended , the last time when she had felt grief gnawing at her like a living thing  --  the day they buried her father , only six months after her mother was laid to rest . The day she had turned from the rolling green expanse , the endless rows of white markers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone . And upon returning home made her final decision to accept the offered berth aboard Geographic . That day , and its decision , and the accompanying grief were like a wood-grain finish buried under layers of cheap , cloudy shellac . It only came to mind when she thought of how very much her mother would have wanted to touch her stomach , to hold her and cry happily with her as women cry , rejoicing in the torch of life being passed from one generation to the next . No , today was worse . One hundred and seventy-four survivors were here for the ceremony , all those who could be moved from their beds . Sylvia held Terry 's hand as he sat in his wheelchair . The word was n't final on his spinal damage yet , but the irony was crushing . We 've got good news and bad news . The good news is that we wo n't have to amputate his left leg ! The bad news is that his spinal cord was severed , and he 'll never walk again anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , Alicia 's baby , the first child born on this new world , had never been found .  | Greg stood near them , and there was a quality in his face that she had associated with Ernst since the Hibernation Instability . His face was empty . It fit . Everything fit together , a mosaic that began with the endless expanse of dappled gray clouds and the thin stream of smoke rising from the smoldering tip of a volcano just the far side of the horizon . Perhaps most of all , what fit was Cadmann . She saw him out of the corner of her left eye , standing alone , with Mary Ann . Strange how that phrasing came to her . Mary Ann stood near him , almost touching him , but they might have been strangers in a subway : intimate through proximity , yet each sealed in his own world . Cadmann 's head turned , and he looked at Sylvia , through her , and she longed to cry out to him , realized through his inaccessibility how very much she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zack 's voice called her from her reverie . " . . . that we might live . All of us knew the risks , but these  --  these few paid the price for our mistake . With time , all of us will lie beneath this soil . Let these . . . thirteen . . . be the last to die by violence . Let our loss merely strengthen our resolve , deepen our commitment . " He cleared his throat . Usually he reminded Sylvia of Groucho Marx . There was no hint of comedy now . He looked old and tired and frightened . " Does anyone want to speak ? " There was a moment 's silence , then Greg spoke in a voice that was pure venom . " Why did n't we listen ? Why could n't we have listened ? Did Cadrnann ask for so much ? " " Greg . . . " Zack 's voice was soft . " This is n't the time . " " Piss on you ! " Spittle flew from the corner of his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , and we did n't find a fucking thing . Now we ca n't find anything , and people are already starting to say that that must have been the only monster . That it swam over from the mainland . That 's bullshit ... " " Gre " g " Fuck you , Zack . I trusted you . We all trusted you . You were supposed to be the one with the big view . Alicia trusted you . And now she 's . . . she . .. " Tears streamed from his eyes and he collapsed to his knees at Alicia 's grave , his fingers clawing at the earth , all the pent-up emotion exploding out of him at once . It was a trigger . Others were crying now , quietly or with great wracking sobs .  | From the corner of her eye , Sylvia saw Cadmann turn on his crutches and hobble away . Silent , solitary again , vindicated by death , dishonored by the only family he would ever have . IN TIME Sylvia lost herself in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself began to slow . Nobody was unaffected by the grief , and in a way it turned into a bond stronger than the original heigh-ho Manifest Destiny enthusiasm that had built an interstellar expedition . Repairs were underway around the clock . In the middle of the mistiest night , the sparkle of laser and plasma torches lit the gloom like dazzling fireflies . Within another week , what had happened had become a symbol almost as much as a reality . The electric wire around the periphery of the camp had been reinforced , reestablishment of full power given the highest priority . Guard shifts were doubled . Every night , several times a night , Sylvia awoke from troubled slumber , to be lulled back to sleep by the silent bob and swivel of the searchlights . The mine field had been reactivated , providing the first dark moment of humor since the tragedy . At just after three in the morning , a hollow explosion had shaken the camp . Frightened , hastily dressed colonists had joined guards outside the gates to find a storm of feathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grim jokes about turkey bombe and flambe had circulated for the next two days , and had helped the healing begin . SYLVIA ceased her efforts to write a new voice-recognition program into Cassandra as a familiar , disturbing figure limped past her window . Cadmann . A crutch under his right arm , side bandaged , a ragged , badly healed scar creasing his cheek in a false smile . A silent giant with dark , accusing eyes . He spoke to no one , taking his meals and medication in his hut . No one challenged him . No one dared to tell him that he should not hate them for what had been done . In her mind Sylvia could see that thing squatting atop Cadmann , grinning down at him , slowly raking the flesh from his body . For a warrior of Cadmann 's nature to have been disarmed , doped , tied and then abandoned to be monster bait was an insult so deep that there was nothing that could be said . And so , to their communal shame , nothing was .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without warning . Zack Moscowitz came in . " Well , he 's gone . " " Hi , Zack . " " That Skeeter you heard . Cadmann stole it . " " Stole ? " " Or borrowed . He did n't say . We tried the radio . He is n't answering , and he 's disconnected the tracer . We do n't know where he 's going , or why . " " You know why , " Sylvia said . " He 's telling us all to go to hell . And maybe we deserve it . " " Yeah . " Moscowitz sighed heavily . " Yeah , I know . Some idiot suggested we go after him and get the Skeeter back . I did n't bother to ask for volunteers . " " So he 's gone . " " Him , and he damn near dismantled his hut . He 's also got two dogs , a rifle , ammunition and a case of liquor . " " It 's his rifle . He 'll have tools , too , " Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , it wo n't come to more than his share . " " The Skeeter 's a lot more than his share . " " He 'll bring it back . " " Did he tell you that ? " Sylvia laughed . " Do n't I wish . No , but he will . He has n't any use for a Skeeter , Zack . He is n't out to hurt the Colony . He just wants ? anyway , you watch , he wo n't take more than his share . " " Yeah . I guess I always knew that . Goddamn him ! " Zack exploded . " Hell , Sylvia , it is n't the stuff he took ! It 's him . We need the son of a bitch . " " And if you 'd ? " " And if I 'd said it loud enough and early enough he 'd still be here . Yeah . Thanks for reminding me . " THE SKEETER returned eight hours later . It landed two kilometers from the camp . Everyone came outside , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cadmann creakily levered himself out of the cockpit . One of the dogs leaped out of the cabin after him . It bounded around his feet , as  | if unable to understand why his new master moved so slowly when there was so much to do , so much to see . Together they walked north . The last Sylvia saw of him was a tiny , lonely figure climbing into the pass , disappearing into the distance and the mist .  | " SAVE ET ! " Sylvia screamed as lights flickered throughout the camp . Jerry 's hands flew over the keyboard . Cassandra 's memory banks had just begun saving when the entire camp plunged into darkness . Shadows flashed back as the sizzling flare of arc welders beyond the communal dining hall created brief lightning storms in the Avalonian midnight . Jerry shouted out the window to the welders . " Goddamn it , you could warn us ! " There was no answer . He sighed . " What did we lose this time ? " " Maybe nothing . " Sylvia glanced at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad when they get the power plant rebuilt . " " Yeah . " He tapped idly at the keyboard . " They say you can get used to hanging if you hang long enough , but I 'll never get used to the power going out . " A brief flare of light , and Jerry 's face was outlined in the darkness as he lit a cigarette . " Have one ? " " You know better than that . "  | He shrugged . " Good time to start . " He put the stiff foil package away . This was a bad time , miserable in almost every way that Sylvia could think of . If Cassandra had n't been damaged by the monster , her automatic power backups would have allowed them to continue the process of collating the satellite data . If she had n't been damaged , all data would have been automatically backed up . If the power plant had n't been damaged , there 'd be no need to run cables from one of the two Minerva shuttles . There would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp . They were lucky to have power at all . The solar collectors uphill did n't collect enough power , and the storage capacity was tiny . And they had dynamite . How do you get power out of two hundred kilos of dynamite ? They 'd found an answer : they 'd dynamited a cliff to dam the river . Now the river featured a long , narrow lake downstream from the camp , a landing field for the Minerva , and now the Minerva 's motor could be brought within reach of cables from the half rebuilt power plant . " There she goes , " Jerry said as the lights winked back on . " I do n't know how much more of this I can handle , " Sylvia said , wiping moist fingers on her pants . " All that it takes , " Jerry answered bluntly . Cassandra booted back up almost at once , and they breathed a paired sigh of relief : none of the data had been lost . Sylvia spoke softly . " Cassandra . Correlate and evaluate : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The computer continued its cross-referencing of the data it received from the geosynchronous satellite above the campsite and the transient data gathered by the lower , faster-moving Geographic . " Northland is heavily populated . " Jerry 's voice held irritation now . The two were like an emotional seesaw . " Conclusive signs of aquatic life . How in the hell are we going to zero in on something like our monster coming over ? " " Data , Jerry . There 's an answer for everything that happened , but right now we just have to correlate data . We ca n't even say exactly what we 're up against . If the protein spectrophotometer can be repaired , we 'll get a look at the thing 's DNA . Until then , we 're doing autopsies on a corpse made of charcoal . " " There must be a pattern . This island is underpopulated . We know that . Not enough differentiation . Samlon , plants , and those damn pterodons high up in the mountains , and they all look alike . It 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects . All tiny . All flying things , no crawlers , and all these empty ecological pockets . It 's like ... maybe ... Sylvia ? It 's like the Earth must have been after the Dinosaur Killer . Nothing big . Most of the species wiped out . Okay . Let 's start looking for iridium in the soil , shall we ? A layer of vaporized asteroid , buried , but not deep . And maybe the satellites can find us a fresh crater . " " Dinosaur Killer  --  Jerry , could that be it ? A big asteroid strike , long winter , planetary die-off  --  when ? A thousand years ago ? Five thousand ? The plants have all come back , but not the animals ? " " Even half a million would n't be too long . " He frowned . " There are other answers , though . Something regular , something that breaks the reproduction cycle . Something subtle . . . maybe it does n't even show up for two or three generations .... " She felt momentary fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugly thought , but no . We 've had three generations of chickens , and four generations of mice . Go for the Dinosaur Killer . " Her fingers flew over the keyboard , bringing to the screen the endless biological sets they had worked out : animal to vegetable kilotonnage , animal populations in the various temperature gradients . In the varying altitudes . In the dry climes . The wet . And on . And on , as they had for four days now . She remembered sleeping until she was entirely slept out , one Saturday following three college exams . She remembered this as she had once remembered hot fudge sundaes while dieting . The answers were always the same . No hostile life on the island . There could n't be . Nothing for it to live on . A simple , near-pastoral ecology . We 're missing something obvious . Something I ought to remember . Is this what the  --  others  --  Mary Ann and Ernst and the others felt like ? Something I ought to know , and I do n't . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing . Jerry , I like your Dinosaur Killer . I think you 've got it . " Jerry carefully blew his smoke in the other direction . " Do you think that an expedition will really go out now ? " " No . Zack wo n't approve it . " " He 'll be lucky if anyone listens a damn to what he has to say after this mess . " " Greg spoke for everyone ? You included ? " " Not you ? " She paused . " I think Zack made an honest mistake , one that any of us might have made , and most of us did ! Zack 's a scapegoat . The fact f  | that Cadmann was right does n't necessarily mean that he was right for the right reasons . He 'd been looking for something to go wrong right from the beginning ? " " I would have expected a comment like that out of Terry . " " No  --  this is n't a putdown . As far as Cad is concerned , somebody has to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficiently by itself . " Cadmann . What are we going to do about him ? " The room lights dimmed again . " Shit ! Cassandra Save ! " THE POWER did n't come back for fifteen minutes . Enough , Sylvia thought . " I quit , Jerry . You should too . ' Bye . " She did n't wait for his answer . Early dawn , but the camp was a hive of activity . The wreckage had been cleared away . New buildings sprouted , bare skeletons rising into the chill morning air . Three work crews in overlapping ten-hour shifts kept the jobs humming along smoothly . Everyone got just enough time to sleep , but not enough to grouse . One monster did this . How many are there ? Dinosaur Killer . It just could be . The idea was exciting . She was already too tired to relax . She chose to walk the long way home . A chill breeze came from Spaceport Lake , and she wrapped her coat more tightly as she neared the power plant . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this stage it had no shape or symmetry , only a chaos of crumbled walls and hastily erected scaffolding . The power plant was one of the first buildings on Avalon . About half a year ago , she thought idly , and nodded to herself in satisfaction because she 'd thought of it as half a year , not just over one Earth Standard . Avalon was home whether they liked it or not . Better learn to think so . The power plant had flown down on a solidly packed one-shot cargo vehicle . A small solid-fuel rocket had dropped it from orbit to glide down on triangular wings . The engine was Minerva-compatible ; in fact the whole package had looked a lot like one of the shuttles , with a Minerva 's wing and belly . Motor , wings , hull , all were spare parts for the shuttles . And damned near all we have , too . What 's left ? A Skeeter hovered over the power plant . A thin girder dangled from its underbelly . Omar Isfahan waved a handlamp , guiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted and epoxied into place . Omar , tallest  | man in camp by three inches , looked tired . His fleshy cheeks drooped , his tight khaki shirt was dappled with sweat . Elsewhere in the structure men were soldering electric cables . When the Skeeter lifted away again someone yelled " Now ! " and the lights flared back to life all over the camp . The glare stole the faint stars from their twinkling positions in the morning mist , but one of the twin moons still glimmered , a tiny dim crescent above the horizon . She felt suddenly , unaccountably lonely . She wanted to go back to her hut and curl up next to her husband . Knowing that Terry would respond , would hold her with what strength he had . Knowing that if she began to cry he would say what comforting things he could . If only . . . if only his new depth of understanding were n't accompanied by a complete failure of his lower body . But she was pregnant , and he was sick , crippled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did n't help that she still thought of Cadmann  --  not his face , and nothing so crude as a sexual image , only a memory of the breadth of his shoulders . The curve of his upper arm , where the muscle showed most clearly , the unmistakably male smell of his body and breath .. . She held herself , watching the construction on the power plant , barely noticing when Zack emerged from the shadows . " Sylvia . " He seemed about ten years older , but there was strength in that maturity . In the faces and manners of so many of them , now . " How are you ? " " Tired , but making progress , I think . " He nodded without speaking . He was staring out toward Mucking Great Mountain , and she did n't need to ask what he was thinking . If a camp vote had been taken the day after the disaster , Zack would have been ousted and Cadmann elected to the post in a moment . Take the vote soon enough after the disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not now . Now he 'd fight . " We 're surviving , " he said . " We 're going to keep surviving . We paid our price for this goddamned planet . It 's all we 're going to pay . " " I hope you 're right , but how can you say that ? Anyway , we all made our decision when we left Earth . We knew the risk ? " " What happened just should n't have happened . " There was absolutely nothing of the old Zack in his tone . She wanted to back away from him . The flash of the arcs and welding lasers cast hard shadows on his face . His eyes were bright .  | " We do n't know if there are any more of those things on the island , " she said , as gently as she could . " It 's going to take time . " " We have time . Those things do n't have any time . " He turned the collar of his coat up . " You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already . " His breath came in short white puffs when he spoke . " They say that I 'm too soft . That this would n't have happened if .. . someone else was in charge . Had been in charge . I ca n't say about that . Whatever 's fair is fair . I can tell you this , though . It is n't happening again . Whether I 'm in charge or not . " Sylvia remembered the image of shadow whipping through the courtyard to leave unbelievable carnage and stinking blood slicks on the tarmac . The Avalonian equivalent of tiny , flying insects still hovered in the courtyard , picking sustenance out of the cracks although they hosed it clean again and again . " Keep looking , " he said . " Harry Siep 's calibrating Geographic 's telescope . Coordinating the satellites . All three will be monitoring the island and the strait . We 're going to train a second team to do the evaluations you and Jerry have been running , so that we 'll have continuous coverage until Cassandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a new security program . Every foot of this island is going to be rephotographed ? " He looked at her suddenly . " Have you seen the latest pictures ? " " No . You 've found something ! " " Not what you 're thinking , not more of the damn monsters . We found Cadmann . " A great sigh ran through her , as if she had been waiting to hear that for a week , unable to admit how important it was . " Thank God . Where ? " " Halfway up MGM . Mesa . Campfire traces three days running . He wo n't answer any radio signals , but it 's him all right . " She paused , waiting for him to go on . When he did n't , she said it . " Are we going after him ? " " Why ? He obviously does n't want anything to do with us . He did n't take anything that was n't his  --  regardless of what a couple of assholes said . " There was real confusion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knows what he owes Cad . He also knows that right now Cadmann could snatch the Colony from him . " What do you want to do ? " Zack thrust his hands deeply into his pockets . " I do n't feel that an  | official delegation would be welcome . A few of his friends , on the other hand  --  people who cared about him and just wanted to make sure that he was all right  --  that might be appropriate . Can you think of anyone who might fit that description ? " She nodded silently . " Good . I was hoping . Well . I 've got things to do . Good night , Sylvia . " Zack walked off the way she had come , toward the rebuilt veterinary clinic . There are n't any heroes here , she reminded herself . Just survivors . The heroes died two weeks ago . Or were crippled . Or broken . Except for one man who we 've shamed and betrayed . We owe him something . TERRY was awake when she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no need for him to be in the infirmary  --  the hut was like a personal hospital room , and since the accident , he seemed to need her more than ever before . If only .. . " Sylvia , " he said sleepily , throwing a warm arm over her as she slipped between the covers . She helped him roll over : he had n't quite gotten the knack of doing it with just his arms . He was working out in the communal gym to improve the strength of his upper body . Already she could feel the renewed tautness in his shoulders . In short months he might double his strength . From the waist up , he would be more muscular than he had ever been in his life . A fine figure of a man , those rippling corded arms pushing his balloon-tired wheelchair around the camp . She squeezed her eyes tightly , trying not to cry . He would taste the tears . He pulled her close to him , and as he did now , kissed her closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did work go ? " " We 've actually classified four different life forms on the main continent . Two are just huge , the size of brontosaurs . The others travel in packs . Fast . In sprints . Our monster might have been a stray from a pack like that . " " What about the expedition ? " " No word . You might still lead it , you know . " Except that we do n't have any sophisticated prosthetics . So you could stay in the Minerva we send over , and watch while other men and P  | women do the exploring . Maybe Cadmann would like to lead it now ? How would you like that , Terry ? Maybe we 'll wait until I 've had the baby , and I have my figure back . Then Cadmann and I can go over there together . What would you think of that , Terry ? Not too fucking much . " Just problems . Manpower . We only have one totally free Minerva . If we need both Minervas somewhere else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be any exploration if the satellites and the telescope aboard Geographic can do the job , " Sylvia continued . " I suppose that makes sense . " Sylvia tried to identify her husband 's voice in that comment . Like everything else in the camp , he had changed . For a time she just listened to his breathing in the dark . Then she leaned forward to kiss her husband , kiss the father of her unborn child . His mouth tasted of sleep , but not unpleasantly . He pulled away from her embrace a few inches . " Sylvia  --  what news is there of Cadmann ? " " Mucking Great Mountain , halfway up . " She felt him nod in the dark . " Go up there , " he said finally . " Talk to him . He 's got to come back . " He strained with his arms to bring his hips closer to her , and even in the darkness she could see that tears glistened on his cheeks . " Terry . . . why ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her stomach . " Because of this . We 're going to have a child soon , and this planet will be hers . " " Hers , " Sylvia whispered . " I ca n't protect her . Cadmann can help make this island safe . I helped drive him away . I think you can bring him back . " She did n't say anything , just kissed him again , remembering a line from somewhere , That which does not kill us makes us stronger . Who had said that ? Kipling ? Nietzsche ? She decided Kipling and resolved to look it up in the morning . " One thing , Sylvia . " His voice took on a wholly different quality . " I 've talked to Jerry . There are going to be ... things that I 'll never be able to do again . You ... you might not have any more children by me unless we AI . " She cradled his head , afraid that she already knew what he was about to say . " Shhh . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you creeping out behind my back , feeling guilty . Sooner or later you 're going to do it . The  | instincts run too damned strong here . We came to make the children that will rule this world . " There was a definite catch in his voice . " All right . Do what you have to . And know that I understand . Just not with Cadmann , please . I know that it 's ridiculous . I just ask you that much . Please . " She held him tightly , as if afraid that with those words he might have said all that he needed to say , done all that he needed to do , and that life might slip away from him there in the darkness . And as they held each other , for the first time since they had landed she realized how very much she loved him , and how much he loved her . SYLVIA 's stomach jolted as the Skeeter hit an air pocket . She lurched to the side  --  the seat belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeeters were built for two , but would seat three if the three were friendly enough . Mary Ann stared straight ahead , as if a studied stare would part the clouds that shrouded the plateau . The tension between them was so thick you could cut shingles out of it , and on a very deep level Sylvia wished that she or Mary Ann had stayed behind . But it was inarguable that Mary Ann and pilot Carlos were two of the closest friends that Cadmann had . Carlos was also a fine pilot , if a little nervous on landings . Lord knows Bobbi Kanagawa had spent enough time coaching him . At least Sylvia assumed that was what they were doing together ... . Carlos brought the Skeeter around in a circle , following the satellite-relayed coordinates . A pterodon cruised by , not so scared by the Skeeters as the beasts had been a year ago . You get used to anything , Sylvia thought . Carlos 's brow was creased with concentration . He grinned crookedly . " Well , senoritas , el muchacho was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered around them again , peering , poking , but staying carefully clear of the rotors . " Eh ! " Carlos yelled , dark face angry . " Apatese un /loco , queso de bola ! " Sylvia grinned at him . " You must have practiced that . That 's the most Spanish I 've ever heard out of you at one gulp . " " One gasp . Gulps go in . Gasps come out . When a gulp comes out , it 's time for the mop . What I said in my musical native tongue was an important , sensitive , poetic statement . " Mary Ann spoke for the first time since the Skeeter had taken off .  | " I do n't speak much Spanish , " she said meekly . " But did n't you say something about moving a fat behind ? " " Ah , senorita  --  it is not what you say , it 's how you say it . " " There it is , " Mary Ann said suddenly . The fog had thinned , and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was tough avalonia grass up here , and Sylvia was surprised at the thickness of the underbrush . Thorn plants , of course , but other varieties too . Shrubs and flowering plants abounded . A squarish tent had been erected , and next to it a husky German shepherd leaped and barked . Cadmann emerged from the tent . He was still a tiny , indistinct figure , but even from this distance Sylvia could see that he was walking unsteadily . Carlos brought the Skeeter down . They were forty meters from Cadmann 's camp , and Sylvia had to admire his choice of locales . The mist was thinner up here , and there was much more vegetation than on the lowlands . Nearby was a tumbling stream of snow melt . It was clear that Cadmann was well provided for . He could build here . Happily . There 's water and food , and there may be game too . He wouldn ' t overlook that . If there 's game anywhere , Cadmann would find it . " Well , " Carlos said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left his rifle in the tent . " " Note the puppy , please . " Mary Ann did n't say anything . Her breathing had turned ragged . " This is Carlos to Civic Center . We 've reached the encampment . Cadmann appears unhurt , and any further reports will follow shortly . " Carlos grinned at them . " Let 's go . " He unbuckled and hopped out . Cadmann watched them for a long moment , then sat down in front of his campfire . He stirred at a pot and ignored them . A week 's worth of beard shaded his face . He moved stiffly  --  the cracked ribs , Sylvia reminded herself . She wondered if he would let her inspect the damage or take a blood test to check infection , or even take his temperature . There was something in his expression  --  something wild and uncomfortably strong , and her stomach went sweet-and-sour . " Cadmann , " Carlos said , his dark hand outstretched . Cadmann looked at the hand and removed a flask from his pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air like half of a suspension bridge  | awaiting completion . Finally he humphed and put his hand back in his pocket . " What the hell do you want ? " Cadmann said at last . The entire campsite was unkempt . The Cadmann she had come to know would never have been so sloppy . " Just wanted to make sure that you were all right , amigo , " Carlos said uncomfortably . " You were hurt pretty bad . " Cadmann glared at them , took another pull and then dropped the flask to the side . The eyes , the unsteadiness . He was drunk , roaring drunk , and had probably been drunk since he came here . " Yeah . Hurt bad . I guess you must care about that . Your conscience acting up ? Hell with it . " " Cadmann . . . " Mary Ann began , moving forward . One flash from those bloodshot eyes , and she stopped . " Keep away from me , " he growled . " All of you . Not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line when it would have made a difference . Stew in it . " " You can say that to me , " Sylvia said . " But not to Mary Ann . She stuck up for you every time . " " Then where was she ? " He screamed it . " Every night , every goddamned night I 've had nightmares , waking up with that fucking monster blowing Ernst 's blood in my face . I do n't know why the hell it did n't just bite my head off . I do n't know .... " The shepherd pup sensed fear and anger , and stood next to Cadmann with bared teeth , growling low in its throat . " She cares , " Cadmann muttered . He took a piece of meat from the pot and threw it to the dog . " It 's all right , Tweedledee . They 're friends . " His laugh dwindled to a chuckle . " That looks . . . fresh , " Sylvia said cautiously . Turkey ? Samlon ? Where 's the other dog ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the rocks . Like a marmot . The dogs sniff ' em out just fine . " He paused . " It would be polite to invite you to supper , but I 'm not feeling terribly polite right now . Why do n't you just say your piece and leave ? " " I miss you . . . " Mary Ann began . Cadmann glared balefully at her , opened his mouth and for just a moment Sylvia was sure that he was going to say something to send her fleeing back to camp in tears . Instead , he just closed his mouth and seemed to chew on the thoughts . " Yeah . That 's great . I can do a whole lot with that . " There was a chorus of cheerful barks from the rocks at the northern  | periphery of the mesa , and another shepherd came bounding out , radiating good , healthy-puppy energy . It ran up to Carlos and , wagging its tail , sniffed his crotch heartily , immediately gave the same treatment to Mary Ann and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who ignored him , and then over to his littermate . They sniffed at each other 's hindquarters and bit playfully . " Crotch sniffers of the world , unite ! " Cadmann called . " Cadmann , " Sylvia said finally . " I 'm not going to lie to you . We need you . We lost a lot of good people last week . We 're trying to put the Colony back together again . You would n't have any opposition to the kind of programs that you were talking about . " " I do n't care now . " He shrugged . " Maybe in a couple more weeks I 'll give a shit , but probably not . Do n't tell me about your goddamned problems . I like it up here just fine . Dogs have their instincts , you know ? They do n't cripple themselves up with what they want to believe , and I like that just fine . Why do n't you just get your asses back down the mountain and leave me alone ? " " Cadmann . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Carlos touched Sylvia 's arm and pulled her back . " Ah , . . . amigo ... is your radio working ? If there 's any kind of problem , anything we can do ... " Cadmann nodded wearily . " Yeah . You 'll be the first to know . Do n't hold your collective breath . " Sylvia turned , trying to hold the tears back . " Sylvia ! " Cadmann called . " Yes ? " " You take care of yourself . " Mary Ann was still staring at him , and for a moment something passed between them : regret or loneliness or resentment . Something , but it was a message shared just by the two of them , and not for anyone else . " Go on , " he repeated . He stooped to pick up the flask . He shook it disgustedly , then tossed it aside again . " Me , I 'm going to stay very very drunk until there 's nothing left to drink . " The three of them returned to the Skeeter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going back . He ca n't say it , but he wants me to stay . " " Mary Ann ? "  | " Ca n't you see him ? He 's killing himself up here . He really wants you , Sylvia ? " Carlos wisely made no comment at all . Sylvia opened her mouth in protest , but Mary Ann cut her off . " Do n't say it , Sylvia . Do n't lie . He wants what he ca n't have . " She stood up straight , a short , strong , pretty blond girl on the ripe edge of plumpness . A woman whose hibernation instability was far more subtle than Ernst 's had been . But she was intelligent enough to know what was gone , and perceptive enough to know what was true between Sylvia and Cadmann . " He ca n't say that he wants me to stay , but what is he going to do ? Throw me out ? I ca n't climb down by myself and he knows it . Leave me here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " " Because you do n't know what kind of man he is . Not really . I do . I know just what kind of man he is . You do n't know him like I do . " For a long , hard moment they faced each other , then Carlos said . " All right . I expect to hear some kind of message from you or Cadmann about this over the radio in the next twenty-four hours . Otherwise I 'm coming back . " " Fine . " Carlos entered his side of the Skeeter . Sylvia looked at Mary Ann carefully . There was something in her , some strength that had not been there since the Landing . " It 's changed all of us , " Sylvia said quietly . " Maybe you 're right . Maybe you 're the only one who knows him now . " She hugged Mary Ann , kissed her on one warm cheek . " For God 's sake take care of him , Mary Ann . He needs someone . " Mary Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . I 'll try . Now , go on . " They climbed into the Skeeter . The rotors whipped to life and Carlos levitated them , higher and higher and then to the east , until Mary Ann 's figure was a tiny , vulnerable speck , walking slowly and uncertainly toward Cadmann 's camp .  | POWDERED EGGS and powdered milk and freeze-dried bacon did n't seem to be a promising start for breakfast . But in combination with Mary Ann 's skill and the last of the samlon meat , they produced a savory fragrance that drifted up from the pan in thin wisps . Tweedledee and Tweedledum , the twin shepherds , padded quietly around the camp , tongues lolling pinkly , looking hopefully at the fire . They sniffed at the smoke but kept their distance . If they were very , polite Cadmann would let them lick the plates . A whiff of ocean salt stirred the leaves and dried grass on the mesa . Avalon 's eternal mist was blown away for minutes at a time . From the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colony was distantly visible : a flash of solar cell banks , the dim , interlocking rectangles of the tilled and irrigated land . The far-off hum of a Skeeter tickled the air . A protracted groan issued from the tent behind her , and she turned to watch Cadmann elbow himself clumsily out past the flaps .  | He glared at her , rubbing granular sleep from the corners of his eyes , and grunted , " What the hell are you doing here ? " She did n't let him see her flinch . " Cooking breakfast . " She stirred the eggs and crumbled in another pinch of dried bacon crisps . Tweedle- h dum , the male , crept up within a meter of the fire , drooling . Cadmann shooshed him away and crawled up closer , shouldering Mary Ann gently aside . His bloodshot eyes narrowed with interest . He started to say something , then caught her smiling at him and turned it into a yawn , scratching himself crudely . Mary Ann caught an awesome whiff of morning breath . Both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , that hurt . " " You earned it . You finished off the vodka last night . " " No , " he croaked , genuine distress in his voice . His voice sounded as if something small and struggling were trapped in his larynx . Cadmann backed into his tent , and emerged holding his canteen . He waggled it in one hand , grinning through a week 's worth of beard at the answering swish . " Hair of the dog . " He tossed it back , guzzling with short , choppy movements of his Adam 's apple . Why do you do this to yourself ? Does n't matter . You 'll have to stop now . He tossed the canteen to the side to clank noisily against a pile of rocks . The dogs attacked him simultaneously from either side , yipping at him to play with them or feed them or any one of a hundred other doggy concerns . Cadmann wrestled with them for a tolerant moment , then shoved both away and glared at them nastily . " If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot you both . I am going to line you up and shoot you both with the same goddamn bullet . Do you understand me ? " They arfed and snapped playfully at each other 's tails and ears . Cadmann stretched , naked but for a baggy pair of shorts . His muscular arms were only fractionally better tanned than his chest . He 's lost weight . The wounds , and then the drinking Mary Ann stopped stirring the eggs as the first curl of smoke wafted up from the pan . " What in the hell is that mess ? " " Call it an Avalon omelet . It 's our breakfast , " she said . He thrust a fork into the pan , probing , and snapped at her , " How much of it is poison ? " She took the fork and shoveled a bite into her own mouth , glaring right back .  | " Half , eh ? Well , I 'm tough . I can handle that . " He tried to sit in a gracefully cross-legged position , but finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " " Your breath . Here . Eat . " Cadmann took the fork back and scraped half the contents of the pan onto a plate . The suspicion in his eyes faded after the first bite . " Damn , this is n't half ? " At the first sign of her smile he shut up and hunched over the pan , sulking as he ate . Mary Ann poured reconstituted nonfat milk and sipped contentedly . It was startlingly clean , and aerated , filled with tiny , needlelike ice crystals from the snow-melt stream that ran near Cadmann 's campsite . Drunk . Hurt Mad . And he 's still picked a better place than Zack ever did .... She squinted across the fire at Cadmann . Time ? Yes , while the hangover lasts . " You can forget about me going back to the Colony . I 'm staying . You can carry me down , but I 'll just climb back . If you want to break both of my legs , that might stop me , but I would n't bet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He ate the last forkful of the eggs , squinted at her and belched with satisfaction . " Right after lunch . " " KEEP the head down . " One of Cadmann 's broad hands clamped onto the back of her neck as they crouched behind an outcropping of rock near the eastern edge of the mesa . " Damn hangfires ? " Brapp ! ! The sound was not as loud as Mary Ann expected , but she heard it as much with her body as her ears . The shaped engineering charge rent the mountainside . Rock chips and clots of dirt flew in all directions . A gout of dust and powdered earth mushroomed into the sky . Crouching next to her , Cadmann grinned . " Fun , eh ? " She bobbed her head nervously . " Finest kind . " His hands were gentle as he helped her to her feet . Shielding his eyes against the dust , he surveyed his handiwork . The third detonation of the day completed a hole in the granite face twenty meters above the mesa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Shelflike slabs of rock jutted out from the earth , their ends shattered by the concussion . " I 'm not sure I understand why you do n't just build on the flat . " " Were n't you in the camp ? " She heard the sarcasm change to something else . He stared at her . " Mary Ann ? " His voice softened . " Yeah . Well , there are monsters here . "  | " I know that . " " So we  --  I ? do n't want to be on the flat . Also , I want the flatland for farming  --  if I decide to stay , all of the farmland will be worth its acreage in gold foil . Second , drainage  --  if I build underground on the hillside , rain and snow melt will run right off , if I build my roof right . Third , view . From where we 'll . . . I 'll be , I 'll have the best damn view that ever was . Right down on their heads . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , and it twists , and I 'll guard it . I wo n't be on some tabletop watching one of those come at me at ninety miles an hour . " She saw it now , and her ears burned . My God , of course not ! Why did n't I see . . . the way he looked at me ? Oh . " It was a stupid question , was n't it ? " " Uh ? " " Cadmann , I know . I can accept it . But  --  well , sometimes it hurts . " His hand moved to touch hers , then drew back . She held her breath . He turned away to survey his work , then turned back , a deeply satisfied smile creasing his face . " There are more reasons , but those will do for the moment . " He looked at her sharply . " Nobody 's asking you to live in it . Or to stay here . " " I 'm staying . " She stood on her tiptoes and locked her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lost too much coming to Avalon . I 'm not losing you , too . " He reached back to unfasten her fingers from the back of his neck , but she clung too tightly , and finally he just met her eyes squarely . " You do things my way , " he said . " If you do n't like it , go home . Down there , things can be whatever way people decide by vote that they should be . This is not a democracy . Up here I 'm the bottom line . " " Male chauvinist , " she said , kissing him lightly . " I 'm a me chauvinist . I 'd probably be the same way if I was a woman . I just want to get this straight before we . . . start anything . " " I love you , " she repeated . The rock dust at the corner of her eyes was slightly muddied . " Love , honor and obey . Is n't that what women used to promise ? I will , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug . " Then let 's get started . " " Aye , aye , sir . What first ? " " Defenses . Notice anything about the  --  our  --  house site ? " " Many things . " " Boulder . That one . " " Big . "  | " And it will roll , once I dig it out . So I dig . Put chocks under it first . Levers on the chocks . Anyone wants to come up the path without per-mission ? " " Any one ? " " Or any thing If it comes up and we do n't like it , we roll the boulder down . " " I 'm for that . ' What next ? " " Terrace down the hill . Vegetable garden . Divert some water from the Amazon to keep the vegetables happy , and us too . Then finish the house . I have to finish the excavation by hand to make sure that I have the dimensions that I want . Then I level the floor and set the corner posts . That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three weeks . Cadmann , how long are you planning to stay up here ? " It was the wrong thing to say , and she knew it instantly . " Until I 'm finished . Until I feel like going the hell back down . And the instant you do n't like it up here , go . " Cadmann tore her hands loose from around his neck and without another word opened the box of tools and building supplies that he had skeetered up from the camp . He was still limping . A TIRELESS machine , made of polished hickory and leather . That 's what Cadmann seemed to her . For all his injuries and his age , he worked on and on when she was exhausted , when the youngest , strongest men in the Colony would have collapsed and begged for rest . He worked eight hours a day , digging , shoring , piling . . . building ridges of earth that would later become garden or upper patio . No effort was lost . He never hauled any dirt or stone uphill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every wheelbarrow of earth and rock moved downhill to the growing garden structure . In some ways the excavation was beginning to look like a smallish swimming pool , with the deep end  --  nine feet deep  --  at the lowest part , and the shallow higher . He cut deep " steps " into the hill above the excavation , so that the entire cavity measured five meters along the bottom edge and twelve meters along each side . When he was through with the morning 's work , Cadmann stretched and took off with Tweedledee to check the traps . ( Mary Ann had found another difference between the twins . Tweedledee 's right ear  | was a bit  --  or , more precisely , a bite  --  short , a souvenir of a kennel brawl that had become serious . ) And here she was able to accompany him , learning to set the wire spring traps that Cadmann set for the slow , almost friendly mammaloids that Cadmann called " Dopey Joes . " He said it was a literary reference . At first she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cook the meals and clean the camp . But it was too easy for her to remember a time when she had been one of the most competent women on the expedition , and there was no way that she could remain satisfied with this new role . She learned to set snares . Nets in the stream that ran past the site of the house from the heights of Mucking Great Mountain , a tiny ice-melt stream Cadmann had named the Amazon . With a large-mouthed basket in one hand and Tweedledee 's leash in the other , she explored the ' 11 mountain , learning the paths and the patches of sliding rock . And it was among them that she found Missy . The snares were set near any of the half dozen or so bushes and plants that showed the characteristic gnawed parallel toothmarks . One patch of plants interested her . They were green and broad-leaved , with thick yellow veins branching from a central stem . The flowers were delicate pink with tiny red berries clustered in the center . None of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves were the favorite food of some local creature . When she took a closer look at the flowers , she noted a dusting of dried insect segments , and more dead , delicately winged husks on the ground beneath the blossoms . The word " poison " flashed through her mind , and she was pleased with herself for making the connection . Something was rustling behind the bush , and she carefully pulled the branches aside . There , its neck caught in a chewproof nylon spring loop , was eighteen inches of furred frustration . The Joe had huge orange eyes almost too large for its face . The eyes were imploring , terrified , confused . They reminded her of . . . what was it ? What . . . ? She stomped her foot in frustration and forgot about it . The creature was in one of the snares , bleeding from the throat , twisting and spitting at her . Tweedledee barked , and the little Joe almost broke its own neck trying to escape . She poked it into the basket and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " Well , Missy , " Mary Ann said . " Ca n't blame you for being upset . " Tarsier . That was the word she had searched for . An equatorial primate , the owner of the largest eyes of any mammal . Found in the forests of Malaysia and the Philippines . She laughed in relief . It was still there . Some of the information was still in her mind , she just could n't call it up on command as once she had . Maybe she could restructure the way she thought .. . She shook the cage and held it up close to her face . " Are you a good-luck charm , Missy ? " Missy spat at her and tried to hide in a corner of the basket . She was more slender than a tarsier , almost like a thick , furred lizard . She lay on her back , claws out and scrabbling blindly . On their way back down , Tweedledee suddenly strained at the leash , tugging so hard that Mary almost dropped the basket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks . Missy went absolutely apeshit , squealing and clawing in the wire cage . " ' Dee Dee , get back here ! " Mary Ann yelled , suddenly suspicious . Reluctantly , the shepherd came back down , tail folded contritely between her legs . Mary Ann wound the leash tightly around a rock , then climbed up and took a closer look , Missy chattering more loudly . Her ears were rewarded before her eyes . She heard a thin , mewling sound that reminded her of nothing so much as the cry of kittens starving for milk . There were six of them , curled up around each other like a tangle of hairy rope . They were just babies , barely able to wiggle . One lay still ; it seemed dead . The others looked up at her with curiosity untainted by fear . Mary Ann glanced from the wire cage to the babies , and sudden inspiration struck . Missy was climbing up the sides of the basket , and Mary Ann thumped her back down , throwing handfuls of avalonia grass and leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she carried the basket up the defile to the rocks . Missy chattered even more frantically now . Down below her , Tweedledee leaped and danced , yipping enthusiastically . Mary Ann braced herself between the rocks , thankful now for hours of jogging , because her calves were starting to bum from all the climbing . She reached down into the crevice and gently drew up one of the Joe kittens . It struggled and bit her hand  --  a scratch , hardly enough to break the skin . Mary Ann set the fur ball back down and pulled her  | jacket sleeve down over her hand in a makeshift glove . This time she could n't feel the teeth at all when she transferred the second Joe into the basket . Mary Ann had to knock Missy down from the side of the cage again , and then a third time when she tried to bite through the jacket . When the first baby was deposited in the cage , Missy scampered around and around in a furry flash before finally slowing down . She sniffed at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitten , enveloping it . One at a time , Mary Ann transplanted the Joes to the cage . Then she trundled it back down to Tweedledee . The mother chattered up at her vilely , then continued to tie her children into a ball for maximum warmth and protection . Mary Ann looked at the last small , sad body down in the crevice , and shook her head . " Time to head back to camp , Dee , " she said , unleashing the dog . She stood with small fists on hips , looking around the area . What did these things eat ? The adults , anyway ? The Joes looked close enough to mammalian ; there would be some sort of milk gland for the young . There were several types of plants : a kind of lichen or moss seemed to be breaking down some of the rocks , and a viny thing that resembled a colony of long-legged spiders . It grew out of the rocks in symbiotic relationship with the moss . There were shrubs up here , and flowering plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the Joe family prefer ? She took a chance : the broadleafed plant that had concealed the snare . She tore loose a cluster of red berries and dropped them into the cage . Nothing . Momma Joe ignored them . Still following the hunch , she tore loose a clutch of leaves , sorted through them for the tenderest , and dropped them in . Missy sprang on them . After careful sniffing , she began to chew . Well , that answered that . Feeling absurdly proud of herself , Mary Ann carried the cage back down to the camp . The sun was unusually warm , and the air sweet , and her mind was already buzzing with ideas for cages . There was something . . . something bothering her about the enclave she had found . What was it ? It was beautiful . More beautiful , more lush , than anything she had seen down on the flatlands .  | Down on the flatlands there was little in the way of tender shrubs . Only the gnarled thorn bushes seemed to thrive down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And come to think of it , animal life , too . That implied something , but what ? What ? Her mind was n't quite clear enough , and she cursed softly . Damn it . Why would n't it come into focus ? Suddenly all the pleasure she had felt disappeared in a welter of frustration . Why would n't her mind work for her ? Hibernation Instability . There . Say it . Accept it . Do n't try to pretend that it did n't affect you , as some of the others do . Do n't try to pretend you still have capacities that have fled . That kind of egotistical nonsense gets you laughed at or killed . Work within your limits , and learn the steps you always pitied ' tweens for having to take . Where a Bright can lead , a Tween can follow . There used to be such smugness in that saying . A genius can take huge leaps , wearing intuitive seven-league boots . Then a corps of engineers and technicians can turn the theories into inventions and principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a genius to devise in the first place . I lost my seven-league boots . But the germ plasm is still mine ! We can make good kids ... . All right . There was something wrong here . But if she had the time and the patience , she could reconstruct the thought processes that once came to her so easily . And it was important for her to reconstruct these . Very important . With the basket in hand , she traveled back down the hill . MARY Arne found it amazing . In three weeks , using a constant , unvarying work schedule , Cadmann had carved the patio and shoring , tamped down the floor of his new house and covered it with layers of polyethylene sheeting . He had set the corner posts using the lightweight foam-steel braces ferried down from the zerograv smelting facility aboard Geographic , and lined the walls with more of the polyethylene . The roof girders and additional support beams were finally in place . Cadmann disassembled their tent and laid it across the top in a makeshift roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The northern wall was earth , but the southern , uphill side was open to the broad , high steps that Cadmann had cut into the , mountainside . Their stove warmed the makeshift dwelling beautifully , and there  | was plenty of headroom and walking space , more than in some of the 1800s pioneer cabins she had visited in Kentucky museums . They sat cross-legged in the shelter . The stove and the body heat of the two dogs were quite enough to keep her warm as she wrote . Two sheets of paper were spread out , and on one she was listing every plant Missy had accepted as food . So far , there were six varieties . The other sheet was blank . I ought to be recording something , but I do n't know what it is . Damn . But  --  I am useful . Cadmann built it , but it 's our house . The earth that surrounded them on three sides was terrific insulation , and there was something womblike about it . So I 'm missing some brain cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry chattering in the distance . Four of the youngsters had survived with her and were old enough to run around the cage . If they could be bred .. . " A garden there , " Cadmann said with vast contentment , pointing back at the series of deep , rising steps cut into the mountain behind the house . " Hanging garden . . . climbing . . . I forget what you call it . Walk path cut in the middle . We 'll be able to mount mirrors at the top . We already get full sunlight as it crosses east to west  --  we can do even better . Roof next , and we 'll top it with soil . " He laughed lazily . " We could plant on our roof if we wanted to . " " It would be nice to have a little more natural light . " Mary Ann folded the sheet of paper and tucked it in with her backpack . He sipped at his coffee , then put an arm around her . It still sent a shiver of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept together for the first week , and when he had finally taken her into his bedroll and made love to her it had been an angry , demanding , selfish kind of love  --  and she had not demanded in return . She was happy to be able to give . But now , as his house was taking form , as the Joes and turkeys filled their cages and makeshift pens , as the plot of worked land doubled and trebled , and the mesa became Cadmann 's Bluff , his personality and signature scrawled more boldly upon it hour by hour . . . He was softer with her at the end of the day , and spoke of " us " and " we . " And she was happy , despite her frequently aching muscles . In the weeks since the attack on the camp , Cadmann seemed to have purged his anger . It had taken useful work , done his way , in his time , to his ends . And the fruits of that labor were his . She moved closer to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll dig the channel tomorrow , " he said . " I need the channel before I can blast . Mary Ann , I think I can run the channel through the house , through the living room . " " For what ? Oh , the Amazon , " she remembered . He wanted to divert water for the vegetable garden . Something ticked at her memory ... " F  --  F ? Falling Water . " " What ? " " I remembered ! Falling Water , a house by F  --  F ? Frank Lloyd Wright , and the water ran right through the living room ! " " That 's what I was trying to remember . You 're amazing ! " I 've never felt like this , she thought to herself . And I 've been married , and in love before , and have had . . . enough lovers to know the difference . There was something about the darkness and the warmth . About being next to a man who had built his dwelling by the strength of his back and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , that made her feel warm and small and protected . Protected . . . A competent , civilized human being did n't need a protector . Mary Ann Eisenhower , Ph.D . in Agricultural Sciences , had been quite capable of taking care of herself , thank you . She remembered the doctor . . . she remembered . Now she was the dependent of a brawny , self-sufficient warrior . And yet there was no cruelty in this man , no demand for her subservience or helplessness : she was sure that he had accepted her because she could do certain things , she could take care of herself . She could go when she wished , and he made that clear . Yet he had accepted with pleasure her suggestions about breeding the Joes . She wanted to do anything for him , be everything to him  --  but if he ever abused her , that urge would vanish . How strange , and how wonderful . How natural to be here , in the earth , huddled with the man she loved , who she hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sylvia . She grinned fiercely , briefly , and kissed his shoulder , her lips parting slightly , tongue flickering out to taste the salt dried on his skin . He pulled her to him , and there , in their home , made love to her on the packed earth of the floor . And they rejoiced together until both were exhausted , until sleep stole the thoughts from her mind as she curled  | against his side . The two of them , surrounded by their home , their dogs , the whispering wind and the small night sounds . Together . CADMANN had finished digging the French drain  --  the rock-filled slit , a foot wide , five feet long and three deep , at the uphill mouth of their home . It would trap rain or snow melt before it could flood their home , and was just another of the little things , the thousand little things that Cadmann had done to their home Their home ! ? to make it safe , and warm , and ideal for her . For them . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rows of strawberries and lettuce and carrots and corn stretched across the mesa wherever there was enough soil to give anything a chance . Much of it would be lost . She expected the strawberries and the hybrid meloncactus to do the best . Two pens of captured turkeys and their cage of Joes were thriving , and as she fed the Joes their morning leaves , they were actually happy to see her . The kittens had sprouted into twelveinch furred lovelies , only slightly less beautiful , and better-tempered , than young foxes . The furs would be useful , and the flesh . . . A sudden cramping wave of nausea fanned through her , and she doubled , gasping , choking back the sour fluid in her throat . This was the third morning that . . . Morning . . . ? She grinned , looking up at Cadmann toiling at the drainage slit . Mary Ann threw the rest of the leaves into the cage and dusted off her hands . " Well , Missy , I think that I have some news for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann and chattered friskily . " Guess who 's coming to dinner ? " CAu her Mama . The taste of the river changed with the seasons . For a time the water would run sluggish and cold . Then the taste of life was scarce ; the flying things were scarce ; the swimming things were dead . Later the water would race , carrying the taste of past times . Mama had seen scores of cycles of seasons . She was wise enough to ignore the ancient tastes : bodies or blood or feces of life her kind had long since exterminated , long buried in mountain ice , released as the ice melted . In the hot season the water would be bland again , carrying only spoor of flyers and swimmers and another of her own race .  | Mama 's taste was discriminating . One of her kind lived upstream . Another lived even farther upstream , and that one was a weakling . It lived where game was so scarce that Mama could taste starvation in its spoor . Not worth killing , that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In winter there was something strange in the water , something she could n't identify . Not life ; not interesting . The world began to warm again . . . and something new was on the island . Something she had never tasted , something weirdly different , was leaving spoor in the water . It was as yet too faint to identify . Mama began to think about moving . If she followed that spoor she would have to fight , and that was no step to be taken lightly . By summer she could taste several varieties of prey ! The things were n't merely leaving feces in the water ; she tasted strange blood too . Her rival was eating well . Was it time ? Her rival was youthful ( Mama could taste that ) but large . The faintness of her scent placed her many days ' journey upstream . She would be rested and fed when Mama arrived . . . and Mama settled back into her pool . She had not lived two scores of cycles by being reckless . If her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . The time of cold had come . Ordinarily Mama scarcely noticed passing time , for the taste of swimmer meat was always the same . Nothing attacked . Her curiosity lay dormant . . . but it was active now , for living things were leaving spoor even in dead of winter , and blood ran down the river now and again . Oh , the variety ! Here was blood from something vaguely like a flyer . This one must have been big , a plant-eater ; she had to dig far into her memory to find anything similar . That horrible chemical stench was entirely mysterious : hot metal and belly acid and thoroughly rotted grass . This unfamiliar scent , judging by its components , would be the urine of a meat-eater not of her own kind . Hunger and curiosity warred with discretion , for Mama had never tasted anything like that , nor seen one either . Once there was a living thing in the water . She snapped it up and chewed contemplatively , trying to learn of it . A swimming thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The world was warming when the river gifted her with two larger  | members of the same species . Bottom feeders tasting of mud , they must be breeding despite the presence of her rival upstream . And that , one bright hungry morning , was the burnt blood of her own kind ! Taste of fear and speed and killing rage , taste of chemicals , taste of burning . If lightning or a forest fire had killed her rival , then an empty territory lay waiting for her upstream . If another rival , then Mama would face a formidable foe . The swimmers were startled when Mama came forth in an eating frenzy . Swimmers were nothing ; the taste did not engage her curiosity at all . But Mama 's rival would be fat now , and hyperkinetic from impact of sensory stimuli , and Mama dared not come upon her as a desperate starveling . She had not fought a serious rival in many years .  | THEY SANG as they strode downhill . Tweedledee bounded around Cadmann 's feet . She was leaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . She was acclimated to the heights and rigors of Mucking Great Mountain , but still seemed happy to be coming back to the Colony . Even here , only a few meters past the firebreak , the distant grind of machinery assaulted Cadmann 's ears . That sound , a constant background hum down on the flatlands , never reached his home in the mountains . A thin line of dust marked the bass rumble of a tractor tilling the fields . Mary Ann walked next to him , her blond hair barely rising to his shoulder . Her presence was a comfort in ways that would have been difficult to imagine just a few short weeks before . How long ago had he walked this path with Ernst and Sylvia ? Back before any of the grief . Back when he could reasonably expect a quiet  | slide into old age amidst herds of children . And he 'd wished for kodiak bears . The view had changed . The fields had expanded ; there were more buildings . The wreckage left by the monster 's assault was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hundred and ninetytwo , the Colony felt pressure to work . There was healing to be done . Now Cadmann had his home , and something new . . . something very new with the only person in the camp who had believed in him . He put his arm around her waist and pulled Mary Ann in closer to him . She had lost some weight , much like Tweedledee , but her curves were still rounded , and now .. . Now ... His arm wound all the way around her shoulder , down to her belly , which was firmer than it had been  --  the work and the life up on MGM was not conducive to softening . Soon her figure would be filling out . And out ! And then . . . He looked at her almost surreptitiously . The ninemile walk had n't tired her . All downhill , half a mile altitude change  --  the walk had strained his own healing wounds , and if someone offered them a ride back he 'd take it . He smiled , utterly content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Cadmann looked up , the tractor was rumbling up the glazed earth road toward them , and someone atop it waving his hands semaphore style . Cadmann cupped his hands to his mouth . " Yo ! " Tweedledee galloped off down the road , kicking her hindquarters up into the air with every lope . In his backpack he carried skins and dried meat and samples of all of the plants near their camp , carefully bundled and labeled . Cadmann Weyland , first of the mountain men ! Much better than Great White Abo . The tractor was close enough to make out the driver . It was Stu Ellington taking his rotation in the fields . " Hey , hey ! If you 'd waited another two days , I would have won the pool . " Cadmann laughed , yelling back , " If you 'll split it with me I 'll vanish for another forty-eight hours . Who wins ? " Stu stopped the tractor in front of them and put the engine into neutral . Hot air curled from the engine in waves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not sure . Hell with it . It 's great to see you , Cad . Mary Ann . Back to stay ? "  | " ' Fraid not . Opening negotiations . Somebody had to break away from the Colony first . " Stu looked down at them from his seat , his grin cutting through the dust and sweat , and shook his head . " Just glad you 're both back , man . " His expression grew somber . " I 'm so sorry for-what happened . " " Yeah . " Cadmann looked decidedly uncomfortable ; then Mary Ann hugged him and patted her stomach . " Stu ! Think I 've got a piglet in the pen ! " " Oh ! Whoa ! Well , this is an occasion . M'lady ! " Stu swung down from the tractor and offered a hand to Mary Ann . She looked back at Cadmann , who just picked her up by the armpits and hoisted her aboard the tractor . " You know how to drive one of these things , I believe ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the seat . She gunned the engine . The tractor made a great , lazy circle . The two men followed it at a short distance . For a while there was companionable silence , and then Stu broke it . " We 've done a lot of rebuilding since you 've been gone . Not just buildings , Cad . We 've got the defenses up , and stronger . Stupidity . Just stupidity . " He seemed to need to hear something in return . " We got blindsided once , but it 's not going to happen again , I can guarantee it . " " Good to know that . " Stu was almost as tall as Cadmann , but somehow at the moment he seemed much smaller . " Do they know that you 're coming back ? Did you radio ? " " No , I sent a homing pigeon . " Stu looked stricken , and Cadmann felt a little disgusted with himself . " Look , Stu  --  if you did what you really felt was right , then fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's got me twitchy  --  skip it . " They have defenses . Great , but where do I come in ? Can they make me inspect them ? Damn . There was a general shout of greeting ahead of them as Mary Ann and the tractor passed the first of the outer pens . Within moments Cadmann was the center of attention . I 've only been gone for five weeks . . . . But any momentary discomfort was quickly drowned in a sea of reaching hands . " Cad ! Welcome back ! " " ? to see you ? " " ? things have n't been the ? "  | And other fragments piled one atop another , overlapping , irritating ' I and at the same time deeply soothing . Mary Ann stopped the tractor by the machine shops and dismounted with Cadmann 's assistance . She melted into his hands with a calculatedly sensuous grace that put him on guard . What was she projecting ? She was using that " forced float " that insecure women use when . . . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lab smock , which was freshly pressed and looked like ? nothing so much as a maternity gown . And a maternity gown that she would n't be wearing much longer . She waddled a bit when she walked , and was carrying the baby low in her belly . She smiled at him , at them both , and there was something very like a wall of glass between her emotions and the smile . Her pageboy haircut was a little longer than the last time he had seen her , and needed a trim around the edges . She held out her hands to him , then , not quite smoothly , shifted positions to offer them to Mary Ann first . " Mary Ann . You look wonderful . " " So do you . I 'm hoping to get some of that glow pretty soon now . " " You mean . . . ? " " Yep . " Sylvia hugged Mary Ann hard , then held her hands out to Cadmann . He took them , fighting to follow her lead , to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for here , but the instant he touched her skin , something inside him melted . He ached for her . " Cadmann . " Her mouth tweaked in an attempt at a casual smile . " Is Mary Ann right ? You have n't been shooting blanks ? " " Nope , someone slipped a live round in there . At least , that 's what we 're hoping . At least , that 's what we came down to find out . " He hesitated . " Would you take care of my lady for me ? " " You know it . " There were tiny moist jewels forming at the corners of her eyes , and she squeezed his hand . " Hey , big man  --  are we going to be seeing more of you ? I 'm going to be losing a passenger in a month . " It had to be his imagination , but her hands suddenly flushed with warmth . He released them , embarrassed by the strength of his reaction . " I would n't miss it . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Promise . Aside from that ... I 've got livestock now , and crops . I just do n't know . "  | She nodded , unwilling to pressure him . " Listen ... I 'll take Mary Ann for a full checkup . Stay for dinner ? " " Count on it . " Mary Ann hugged Cadmann and planted a long , proprietary kiss on his mouth , pressing herself against him , to the appreciative guffaws of the crowd . Then she and Sylvia linked arms and marched off together . Cadmann shifted his pack around until the pain in his ribs eased ( and a fresh ache started in the bone of his right hip ) . He continued on into the camp . A zigzag walkway through the mine field was painted bright green , and he followed it , noting the guns placed to cover that path . He nodded approval . None of the children were walking yet . We 'll have to fence off the mine field when they get older . And ? No ! Not my department ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a papooseka backpack . What the hell . He did n't have to live here to love those little faces . It was n't the children 's fault that their parents were idiots . Dammit , these were his children too . The veterinary lab had been repaired . Its side was a mass of patches welded in great discolored blotches at the corners . The structural damage to the quad had been repaired . Nothing could hide the scorch marks , but there were strings of colored ribbon wired up around the edges , and the beginning of a banner painted in bright orange and green . In the center of the quad was something new that glistened in the morning light . Cadmann bent to read it . Set into the concrete was a metal tablet , tinted to look like brass , that said simply : " Day 295 , Year One . REMEMBER . " Following those words in a silent tribute were etched thirteen names . He traced them with his fingers . Alicia : gone . Barney , Jon , Evvie Sikes : gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " Zack said behind him , and Cad turned to greet him , clasped his hands strongly . Zack did n't look tired  --  he looked hard and wiry and serious . He had trimmed his mustache short , and there was a partially healed burn scar along the inside of his forearm . " We were wrong  --  you were right . I 'm sorrier than I can say . " " Do n't bother being sorry . Just do n't let it happen again . " Zack took Cadmann by the arm . " Come on . Let me show you Monster Watch . "  | " The mine field ? " " We turn it on at night . " " And new fences along the gorge . I like it . " " You 'll like it better . " Zack held the door of the corn shack open as Cadmann shucked his backpack . Pain eased in ribs and hip . Two extra screens had been mounted in the room , and there was a cot in the corner that looked recently used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swivel chair , his dark face speckled with crawling dots of reflected light . He distractedly waved a hand in greeting . One of the six flat video screens was dark , but three others viewed the Colony from varying local angles , and two scanned their island from the geosynchronous satellites . " We 've got the ocean-observation program going  --  this is the long view . We 're also analyzing weather patterns to attempt to build up a model . But we 've got optical and infrared sensors working . We should be able to track anything man-size moving close to the surface . If the computer scans an object moving in our direction , it 'll call our attention to it . " The picture abruptly changed to a high-altitude view of the ocean itself . Endless gentle white waves rolled in from the west . The ocean seemed deeply and peacefully azure . The illusion was one of guileless transparency . Of an ocean without secrets , welcoming their inspection , soothing away their fears . " The ocean lies , " Cadmann muttered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has surfaced yet . " " Nothing notable . Not so far . " The screen flickered again , and a roughly fish-shaped outline flashed darkly across the display . A wave of liquid crystals , and the silhouette became an animation . A statistical table ran its estimate column along the edge . Andy watched the figures hawkishly , then relaxed . " Twenty meters along the side , surfacing fifty kilometers east of Landing Beach . Totally aquatic , Zack  --  I 've seen these before . They do n't pose a threat to anything on the land . " Zack traced a finger across the image . " Keep me posted . We ca n't have damage to one of the Minervas . " To Cadmann : " We can get a lot more precise than that . " " I was just about to ask  --  but you 've made a good start . " " We need more , a lot more . All the intelligence that we can                  @ @ @
