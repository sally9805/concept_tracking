Flanked by the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building and the U.S. Court of International Trade , Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan is one of the ugliest public spaces in America . Everything , from its coarse buildings  --  which look the way institutional disinfectant smells  --  to its dry , littered fountain , begs for prolonged shiatsu with a wrecker 's ball . But since no one is going to do that , would the next best thing be to put a Major Sculpture by a Major American Artist there ? <P> In 1981 a sculpture was installed in Federal Plaza . It was certainly major : a curving , unbroken wall of steel plate , twice the height of a tall man and 120 ft. long . The plates leaned inward slightly but emphatically and cut diagonally across the plaza  --  a raw , rusty , hulking gesture . Its title was Tilted Arc , its author was Richard Serra , and it was commissioned by the General Services Administration , a branch of the Federal Government , as part of its Art-in-Architecture program . The cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loathing to many of the people who worked in offices around it ; they complained that it prevented their crossing or even using the space . In March the regional administrator of the GSA , William J. Diamond , convened a public hearing to gather opinions ( both expert and lay ) on Tilted Arc . Some 180 people spoke , two-thirds pro , one- third con . Last month a GSA-appointed panel recommended , based on the hearing , that the sculpture be removed , but the final decision will be made in Washington by GSA Acting Administrator Dwight Ink . The piece 's public unpopularity is not shared , or at least not publicly echoed , in the art world , where Tilted Arc has become an inflammatory issue that may greatly affect the future of public sculpture in America . Or so the defense insists . <P> If American public sculpture is in trouble , and it is , the response to Serra 's work is not a cause but a symptom . Sculpture has largely lost the commemorative uses it had a century ago . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a vague sort of visual fluoride . Its role has also withered as social compacts about the use of public space have been trashed . The aerosol valve has done for eyes in American cities what the suitcase radio has done for ears : civility dies before the corrosive jibber-jabber and the intrusive spray can . Graffiti are the strangling weeds on the ruins of the idea of public art . No wonder most city dwellers today think of public sculpture as just one more semivisible addition to an already cluttered environment , and would rather have a nice tub of petunias . <P> The GSA knew what it was getting in Serra 's commission . It saw artist renderings and models . It did not expect a cute bronze of Peter Pan . Serra 's massive walls and propped assemblies of steel and lead plate are among the most familiar images in recent American sculpture  --  blue-collar minimalism , a pugnacious combination of muteness with extreme manipulations of space . Nobody could call his work accessible , but there is no denying his influence on other artists . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maya Ying Lin 's monument to the Viet Nam dead in Washington , D.C. , the most intensely moving war memorial in America , is basically a spin-off from Serra 's land sculptures .
