HOROWITZ AND MRS . WASHINGTON by Henry Denker <P> If Sam Levene had graced the British stage for 53 years , he would long since have been knighted . He is a pluperfect master of the groan , the pause , the gravelly riposte , and nobody , but nobody , has his comic timing . <P> In this comedy , Levene is Samuel Horowitz , an aged widower who has been mugged by blacks , suffered a stroke and is blisteringly irate to find himself in the hands of a black therapist . Formidably equipped for any racial skirmish , Mrs. Washington ( Esther Rolle ) is the kind of woman who could make the Rock of Gibraltar crumble . While the antiblack , anti-Jewish jokes may offend those of liberal pieties , the laughter on opening night roared through Broadway 's John Golden Theater at hurricane force . The odd couple radiates sweetness and light at the end of the evening . <P> Horowitz is nothing if not democratic in his prejudices . He loathes the New York Times and , at one point , spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper : " Some President ! Whatever General Sherman did on his march through Georgia , we are now even . "
