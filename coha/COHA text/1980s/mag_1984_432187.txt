 | Like a lot of boys who grow up in Michigan , Tom Monaghan dreamed of someday playing baseball for the Detroit Tigers . As an adult , Monaghan did better than play for the Tigers ; he bought the team . And to complete this fantasy come true , in the first year of his ownership Monaghan 's Tigers won the American League championship and this week will play in the World Series ? almost a replay of the series that a lonely eight-year-old orphan named Tom Monaghan listened to on the radio back in 1945 at St. Joseph 's Home for Boys in Jackson , Mich . Monaghan 's life has all the stuff of an old Frank Capra movie starring Mickey Rooney as the gutsy kid and Jimmy Stewart as the indomitable adult . When he was four his father died of bleeding ulcers on Christmas Eve and his mother packed young Tom and his brother off to the Jackson orphanage . He bounced from there to a series of foster ? homes ; as a teen-ager he did a short stretch in a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enrolled in the University of Michigan , but had to drop out for lack of money . In 1960 he and his brother borrowed $500 to buy a pizza parlor in Ypsilanti . A few months later he bought a second store in nearby Mt . Pleasant , where he met his future wife , Marjorie , while making a delivery to her home . Today Monaghan owns Domino 's Pizza ? with 1,600 stores the country 's fastest-growing pizza chain ? and counts a personal fortune worth well over $300 million . Monaghan started off in the pizza business at the invitation of his brother , James , who had found a hole-in-the-wall operation for sale . " I jumped right at it because at the time I still wanted to go back to school , " he recalled last week . " I thought : great , the place is only open from 5 to midnight . That was a laugh . I was there 100 hours a week and we were losing money hand over fist . I never did get a chance to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky start ? at one point his bank took over 49 percent of his operation and , Monaghan said , " I went from being the boy wonder of Ypsilanti to the village idiot " ? Domino 's began to prosper . By 1975 the chain numbered 100 stores and by 1982 , 750 . It is now growing at the rate of more than one a day , and Monaghan confidently expects to have 2,500 outlets by 1985 . Profits are growing as well ; from $1.4 million in 1980 to $5.1 million ( on sales of @# $366 million ) last year . And a good chunk of those profits go to Monaghan , who owns 95 percent of Domino 's stock ( he bought out his brother with a used car shortly after they started the business ) . There are a number of reasons for Domino 's success . First , pizza aficionados maintain , the product tastes good . And Monaghan insists that the pie arrive at a customer 's home hot : each store can serve an area only within a 30-minute delivery radius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally was 24 minutes 36 seconds after the order was placed . To help set a quality standard , the company owns more than one-third of its stores , and nearly all of the remaining franchises are run by franchisees who came from within the organization . The typical franchisee got his start as a driver or cook while in college and bought his franchise with financing help from Domino 's ? another way to maintain loyalty and product quality . Finally , Monaghan fosters esprit de corps by offering his 30,000-person work force an array of prizes ranging from thousands of hand-lacquered $190 pens to his own $12,000 Rolex watches . " People work harder for these things than they do for money , " he maintains . Passion : But it is the Tigers that put the light in Monaghan 's eye and the spring in his step these days . He bought the club last year after long and delicate negotiations with the club 's former owner , 83-year-old John Fetzer , who finally pegged the price at $50 million ? a sum Monaghan happily paid without haggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever wanted , " he said last week . " When I was a kid in the orphanage , the Tigers were about the only thing we had to look forward to ? the games on the radio and the one game a year the Knights of Columbus would take us to . I had big plans for Domino 's so maybe I could buy the team . And owning them is better than a dream come true , because I never knew if the dream was attainable . " And there are rewards other than psychic ones : with Tiger attendance up by 875,000 over last year , when the team finished second in the American League 's Eastern division , 1984 profits are expected to soar past $4 million . Along with the Tigers , Monaghan now has the time and money to indulge his other lifelong passion : the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright . A few months ago , at a public auction in New York , he bought the dismantled pieces of a Wright model home that had stood on the site of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 300-acre site near Ann Arbor that will contain Domino 's new world headquarters and a 30-story tower also designed by Wright but never built . But this week , all that will have to wait ; the orphan kid from Jackson and his beloved Tigers have a World Series to win . NEWSWEEK/OCTOBER 15 , 1984
