More Middle East jitters send precious metals leaping into orbit <P> In one hectic week , the long surge in gold , silver and other precious metals crested into a wild pay-any-price frenzy . While bullion traders from Hong Kong to Zurich to Kansas City gaped in amazement , panicky investors big and small reacted to the worsening turmoil in the Middle East and the increasingly troubled world economy . They sent precious metal bars , coins and trinkets on the most dizzying roller-coaster ride in memory . Prices touched levels that were inconceivable a few months ago . Said a New York commodities expert , George Clarke , in a revealing if overwrought explanation of the market 's extreme volatility and nervousness : " In my opinion what is happening is that the world is looking at World War III . " <P> On a single day , gold climbed $74.50 per oz. , or more than twice its total value as late as 1971 . During the week , it climbed an incredible $148 , to hit $660 per oz. before slipping back suddenly at week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall gain of 18% in only five days . <P> The sell-off was spurred partly by rumors that the U.S. was planning a surprise gold auction of as much as 6 million oz. in an effort to break the price runup . Though the Administration denied the rumors , the U.S. could well afford such an auction . The nation 's gold reserves are still far and away the largest on earth , totaling some 276 million oz . At last week 's closing price , the reserves were worth some $165 billion , or more than twice as much as those of second-ranked West Germany . By comparison , the Soviet Union 's official reserves , though never disclosed , are estimated by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to be less than 45 million oz . <P> Silver , which had climbed more sharply than gold during 1979 , leaped by $7 per oz. , to a peak of $41.50 , or a rise of 20% . Then it , too , fell back , with equally extreme gyrations , to some $36.10 . Even at that figure , silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of the 1970s . <P> Other metals also rocketed . Platinum , which is used for jewelry and manufacturing of such products as jet engines and high octane gasoline , soared from $693 to a record $870 per oz. before settling down to $767 . <P> Titanium , which is used in the manufacture of aircraft and was trading for as little as $3.98 per Ib. earlier in 1979 , has been climbing steadily , in part be cause of a cut in world exports by the Soviet Union , the leading titanium producer , which needs it for domestic consumption . By last week , New York dealers were selling the metal for as much as $25 per Ib . Even copper climbed nearly 10% as speculators pushed it to a record $1.11 per lb . <P> The explosion in metals prices fuels inflation psychology by undermining confidence in money itself and making it seem smarter to spend the currency on almost anything rather than save it . Metals mania also vindicates such economic Cassandras as James Dines and Franz Pick , who for years have urged investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world economy . As gold soared , the dollar continued its plunge against foreign currencies , hitting an all-time low of 1.70 deutsche marks , and sinking against the Swiss franc , Japanese yen and British pound , though it recovered somewhat at week 's end .
