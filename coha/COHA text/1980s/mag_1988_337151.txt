Does any real American ever get tired of listening to Hollywood stories ? Apparently not : year after year the movie books roll off the presses . The newest  --  and one of the best  --  is Hollywood Anecdotes by Paul F. Boller Jr . and Ronald L. Davis ( Morrow ; $18.95 ) . <P> Boller and Davis seem to have mined every shiny nugget in the Hollywood Hills . Could any screenwriter have written funnier lines , for instance , than those of Lewis J. Selznick , one of the pioneer moguls ? A victim of anti- Semitism in his native Russia , Selznick nonetheless had a forgiving nature . When Czar Nicholas II was deposed in 1917 , he sent him a cable : " When I was a poor boy in Kiev some of your policemen were not kind to me . . . stop I came to America and prospered stop now hear with regret you are out of a job . . . stop feel no ill will . . . if you will come New York can give you fine position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense stop .

Director Ernst Lubitsch complained that West , who was her own screenwriter , was hogging the best lines in one of her films . Every story has two characters , he reminded her . " Look at Romeo and Juliet . " To which Mae haughtily replied , " Let Shakespeare do it his way . I 'll do it mine . We 'll see who comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all belonged to Orson Welles , who was always seeking perfection , or better . When the 60-day shooting schedule of Welles ' The Lady from Shanghai ran to 90 days , the studio sent a watchdog , Jack Fier , to speed him up . Welles erected a sign that read THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FIER IS FIER ITSELF . Not to be outdone , Fier put up his own placard : ALL 'S WELL THAT ENDS WELLES . <P> No one , however , was faster with a comeback than Alfred Hitchcock . " Mr. Hitchcock , what do you think is my best side ? " asked an actress during the filming of Lifeboat . " My dear , " he replied , not even bothering to look up , " you 're sitting on it . " A man wrote to say that after seeing poor Janet Leigh butchered in the famous shower scene in Psycho , his wife was afraid to step into the bathtub . What should he do ?
