THE FUTURE of Yugoslavia rests at present with two dead men : President Tito , whose long life and pro-tracted illness ended last year ; and Cardinal Aloysius Stepinac , former archbishop of Zagreb , who died in obscurity and under house arrest twenty-one years ago , but is proving in death more dangerous to the communists than he did in life . The reputation of these two men is of more concern to Yugoslays than the jostling for place of the various nonentities in the present " collective lead . ership . " The case of the cardinal , though the most pressing worry these days , is best understood in the context of Yugoslav politics as a whole , and so I shall start not in Zagreb , the Croat and Catholic center , but in Belgrade , the capital of the Serbs and of federal Yugoslavia . Tito 's tomb in Belgrade does not , like Lenin 's in Moscow . display the mummified carcass of the dictator , but it attracts similar coachloads of venerators . Yugoslav publishing houses continue to put out Tito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mementoes of his birthplace , early political struggles , trial and imprisonment , his leadership of the Partisans in the war , and his last thirty-five years as an international statesman . Every shop , caf ? , and public place still carries a picture of Tito ; not one carries that of the new " collective leadership . " While during his lifetime it was considered respectful to show a recent impression of Tito in presidential gear , he is now often shown as a young mechanic , or wearing round spectacles to disguise him from the royal police . In spite of such artifacts , I do not believe that Tito is turning into a cult figure , like Stalin or Mao ( before their disgrace ) , or even the Turkish leader Kemal Atatiirk , whose busts are still appearing in hundreds of thousands , fifty years after his death . During his lifetime , Tito enjoyed the trappings more than the power of autocracy . He did not try to subject his people through terror , through spellbinding oratory , or the kind of collective hysteria that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalin 's paranoia and morbid suspicion , which sent millions to death or slavery . Tito did not , unlike Mao Zedong , regard himself as a prophet or poet . Tito 's severest critic is Milovan Djilas , the former disciple and colleague who broke with the party in 1954 and started the slow spiritual journey away from Marxism , a journey recorded in many books , of which the latest is Tito : The Story from Inside This acerbic memoir spares no detail of Tito 's egoism and vanity : how he changed his clothes three or four times a day ; abandoned his mistresses and his wives ; collected villas , palaces , medals , and works of art in the style of a Louis XIV of France or George IV of England . " Without doubt , " Djilas declares , " Tito was the most extravagant ruler of his time . " Like Archduke Franz Ferdinand , the Habsburg murdered at Sarajevo , Tito maintained a private train ; he developed a craze for hunting , and even took over the archduke 's private island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the war , Tito " had an overwhelming concern for his personal safety . " I think Djilas means that Tito liked to sleep in a bombproof cave or shelter , which may be true , but his bravery under fire is too well established to be called into question . Yet even Djilas , for all his disappointment about a man he once both loved and admired , can not pretend that Tito was a despot . Tito was tolerant and had no cruelty in his nature , though Djilas attempts to portray these virtues as weaknesses . Since Djilas claims that during this century the communists have themselves done to death 700,000 other communists I most of them in the Soviet Union ) , his own survival , albeit including seven years in jail . attests to the mildness of Tito 's regime . Even today , after the publication of Tito , Djilas is thought to be still at liberty , though he is no longer seen at his favorite cafes , the Metropol and the Moskva . I T IS EASY but misleading to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus individual freedom ; of socialism versus liberal democracy ; of pomp versus plain living . That is how Djilas sees it now . But I was in Yugoslavia when Djilas quarreled with Tito during the winter of 195354. and then it seemed otherwise . Before the quarrel , Djilas was on the left of the communist party . My " reactionary " friends , as they proudly called themselves , said Djilas was the worst of the bunch , a rabid ideologue who wanted to build the socialist future now , at whatever cost . Certainly he had led the demand for rapid industrialization , collectivization of agriculture , and a militant foreign policy against the West as much as the East . He was a puritan and fanatic . Once , when hewas minister of information , he printed in Borba a long complaint that two black marketeers had been given prison terms instead of the death sentence ; as a result of this they were hanged . ( When I taxed Djilas with this , many years later , he said that in the past he was stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his victims . ) In 1953 , when he was writing a series of articles critical of the party elite ? the germ of his later book The New Class ? his words were interpreted by the young party militants as the voice of true socialism flaying the bourgeois revisionists . My communist student friends praised Djilas because he habitually wore a cloth cap and an open-necked shirt , and rode in a streetcar instead of a limousine . He was still an idealist , a utopian . He had not yet learned from the Jacobins or the Trotskyites that every revolution produces its Bonaparte or its Stalin . In fact , the liberalization of Yugoslavia over the last quarter century owes more to Tito than to those , like Djilas , who went into opposition . The most obvious sign of this liberalization is worker self-management , which began soon after the quarrel with Stalin and , at first , was understood in the West as a kind of window dressing to hide the continued control of the communist party . But worker self-management proved a reality ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notably tourism ) , the workers ac tually make the decisions on pay , policy , and investment , knowing that their own well-being depends on it . Efficient production of something the market wants can produce big bonuses and a wage increase ; failure results in bankruptcy from which the staff can expect no severance pay . This explains why , in some of the best-run companies , the workers elect to pay their skilled executives , for example , sales managers , ten or twenty times more than the lowest paid ? far more than in Western countries like England . Self-management has its failings ; it precludes , for example , the raising of risk capital for investment : it also leads to proliferation of factories manufacturing the same thing throughout the country , so that , for instance , each of the six republics may be producing toothpaste or cigarettes when it would make more economic sense to centralize ; but worker self-management is not a fraud or charade , as some outsiders predicted it would be . Even Djilas admits as much . and , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The liberalization of Yugoslavia springs from economic change . Besides self-management , the country has come to depend on large-scale emigration abroad to work and also a large , prosperous self-employed class . In the last twenty-five years hundreds of thousands of Yugoslays have gone as semipermanent exiles to Canada , the United States , South Africa , and above all Australia and New Zealand . These are a group quite distinct from those who fled Yugoslavia after the war and went overseas as political refugees , though some of the new bunch claim political status . The millions of Yugoslav Gastarbeiter " guest workers " ) in Germany and the West have been invaluable to Belgrade as a source of hard currency and as a way of acquiring skills ; the system has also meant exposing the whole of the Yugoslav population to Western ideas and values . As a result , Yugoslavia has long since abandoned any attempt to shield its people from " capitalistic influences " ; travel permission is easy to obtain , and censorship is confined to books or newspaper articles critical of the Yugoslav regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest workers have used their savings to start up a business in Yugoslavia 's flourishing private sector of shops , artisan services , catering , teaching . and translation , as well as the law and medicine . Up at the top end of the Boulevard Revolution in Belgrade ? on the other side of the street from where I lived in a student hostel twenty-eight years ago ? I counted , within two hundred yards , no fewer than eight shoe stores , five handbag stores , and three glove stores , apart from the many shops selling everything from buckles to sweet Turkish cakes . Plumbers and electricians do very well . So do 24 butchers , bakers , greengrocers , and the like . As for restaurant owners , I met a Scotsman , married to a Yugoslay. who kept an excellent inn up in the mountains of Bosnia and is prospering as he had not been able to in central London . T HE CHAIN STORE , that curse of the Western world , is happily absent in Yugoslavia , where small private enter-prise is left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a country like England national and local taxes are weighted against the self-employed , in Yugoslavia the self-employed are a privileged group , although naturally they have to provide for their own insurance and pensions . They , as well as the salaried business and professional Yugoslays , make up the " New Class " that Djilas derided . They also provide the hulk of the membership of the communist party . The old generation of Partisan fighters ? many of them from the highlands of southern Serbia , Montenegro , and BosniaHerzegovina ? have retired and their places have been taken by high-school or university graduates from Belgrade and the other cities . The " working class " of manual laborers forms only about 10 percent of the party and even these are mostly career officials who no longer clock in at a factory . The old Partisans were at first rewarded with jobs in the army and , even more commonly , the police , where they usually acted with bigotry and ferocity ; but now even the punitive arm of the party is largely composed of townspeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this means a loss of communist principle , a falling-off in idealism ; but it also means that the party shares the mentality of the people it governs ? a popular culture and set of beliefs not markedly different from those of the West : the same tastes in pop music , TV , sport , and sex . Some Yugoslays and foreigners , myself among them , are beginning to turn against Yugoslavia because it is too much westernized . Yugoslays boast of their traffic jams and willnot give up their cars , though the country can not afford imported oil . In every town there are gloomy projects of high-rise flats ? peeling as soon as erected ? with all the attendant troubles of loneliness , vandalism , crime , and broken families . The sons and daughters of peasants forget their culture , hundreds of years old , to find in their literature and their movies the hedonism and dubious freedom of what in America used to be called the " sexual revolution . " Every magazine has its explicit sexual illustrations . About one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything that is trashy about the capitalist system is aped and admired by the Yugoslays ? from Penthouse to high-rise revolving restaurants . T HE COST of this westernization is economic as much as moral . Like Lenin and Stalin before him , Tito believed that socialism would have to be built by the industrial proletariat , the " vanguard of history , " in order to free mankind from what Marx called the imbecility of rural life . " Lenin himself proclaimed that Ford , with Marx , was the founder of socialism . The ' Yugoslav communist party 's bias in favor of industry over agriculture was reinforced by a sense of backwardness , of needing to catch up with the industrialized world . Djilas blames Tito for the downgrading of agriculture under the communists ; but few Yugoslays , in or out of the party , have woken up to the havoc wrought by industrialization . I have already mentioned the bad economic and social effects of swelling the population of towns and getting the country addicted to automobiles . These things are evident to the casual visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside . Figures are hard to find but I learned that the rural population has fallen by at least a third over the last twenty-five years . In the 1950s , in early summer , when the shepherds would drive their flocks from the Dalmatian coast into the cool of the Bosnian mountains , one could see hundreds of thousands , even millions , of sheep on the move . Returning recently to the same route at the same time of year , I saw flocks of only a few thousand sheep ; and where once there were only paths were metal roads , with police radar traps . The communists first set out to downgrade the peasants by forcing them into collective farms and limiting private land to a few , uneconomic fields . Since those early years , most collectives have been abandoned but peasants are forbidden to become big farmers or employ other than casual labor . Moreover , the banks will not extend the same kind of credit to farmers that they give to small factories or , for example , to tourist hotels . Peasants do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have to pay their medical bills ; and their children get an inferior education , since teachers want to stay in the towns . A couple of years back I read in a Yugoslav magazine of a Serbian village whose people were terrorized by the local bears . Curiosity whetted , I went with a Yugoslav friend to the village , which was on the top of a mountain , overlooking a gorge where Tito had fought one of his most desperate battles . The road petered out near the base of the mountain , so that we had to walk for an hour and a half through woods and pastures where deer grazed unconcerned , till we got to the Shangri-La village of bears . There certainly were bears in the neighborhood . Packs of wolves used to roam about at the end of the war . There were strips of cloth fluttering in the breeze , which I took to be scarecrows keeping the birds from the fruit . until one of the locals explained that this was to scare the eagles away from the hen run . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity , and , of course , television , this was a thriving and happy village . We were regaled at every cottage with stories , bacon and bread , and countless glasses of plum brandy . But as for the bears driving the people away ? this was a fabrication , dreamed up by the magazine to try to persuade the people to leave their village and move to a more convenient place in the valley . The local communist party boss , in whose house we stayed for two nights , complained bitterly of the bias shown by the government in favor of townspeople and against the peasants . Yet this village , far from demonstrating the " imbecility of rural life , " seemed an altogether more happy , natural , and hopeful place than Belgrade now just another raucous city . And , what is more , the villagers knew they were well off . Not even the young people craved the baubles of modern technological life . Paradoxically , this Yugoslav communist party , which claims to speak for the urban proletariat , was brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom came from the mountains of south Serbia , Montenegro , and Bosnia-Herzegovina ; the same kind of ferocious peasants who had battled against the Turks over the last six hundred years . Throughout the Yugoslav countryside you hear stories ? most of them true ? of some local man who has been to work as a guest worker in Germany , and brought back to his village a giant , shining Mercedes , which , of course , soon rusts and falls to bits . It is sad enough that a peasant should waste his hard-earned money on such frippery . But Yugoslays fail to see the deeper irony . If the same guest worker had spent his earnings on buying a tractor , or other farm machinery . he could have made himself a very rich man . Except for the stony Dalmatian coast , most of Yugoslavia 's soil is rich ; the plains of the Danube and Sava rivers have some of the best black earth in Europe , and could , if properly tended , make this country a great exporter of food . Yugoslavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning back to agriculture . The political implications may be distasteful , but three of the most economically successful countries now are Uruguay , Argentina , and Chile , which have given up protecting industry and turned themselves into exporters of agricultural produce . The results may be cruel in social terms ; but all three countries have huge balance-of-payments sur pluses . Yet Yugoslavia , whose agriculture is potentially richer than that of any of them , has been crippled , and almost bankrupted , by its lack of foreign earnings . s o FAR , I have tried to show that Tito 's failings ? his love of pomp , his craze for industrialization , his admiration for all things Western and modern ? were not communist in their inspiration , and the same must be said of his greatest success in making Yugoslavia a proud nation . This country , on the face of it , was one of the least viable mongrel states created by Woodrow Wilson out of the wreck of Europe in 1918 . The Serbs , Montenegrins , and Macedonians belonged to the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were and are Orthodox Christian or Muslim . The Croats and Slovenes of the north had lived for centuries under the Catholic rule of the Habsburgs . They considered themselves superior to their fellow countrymen of the east . Yugoslavia , between the world wars , was torn apart by national hatred . Quite apart from the border disputes with Albania . Bulgaria , Hungary , Austria , and Italy ( only Romania has always been friendly ) , the country was split by enmity between Serbs and Croats . The Serbs from Belgrade had the monarchy , 90 percent of the top police and army jobs , and a sense of being the ruling race . The Catholic Croats considered themselves oppressed in their own country , as Catholic Irishmen used to feel about England . Like the Irish , the Croats resorted to terror ? the Ustashi gang , whose victims between the wars included the Serbian King Alexander 11 . In 1941 , when Germany and then Italy occupied and invaded Yugoslavia , the Ustashi took control of an " independent " Croatia and began to massacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was where Archbishop Stepinac entered the story . Archbishop Stepinac ? he was not given his cardinal 's hat until 1954 ? did not endorse the Ustashi regime ; but lie did not go out of his way to LETTER FROM ABROAD denounce it . Foolishly , he allowed himself to be photographed in his palace at Zagreb with Ante Pavelie ' , the Ustashi dictator , and various German officials . He failed to make an outright public denunciation of Ustashi crimes , which included the murder of 300,000 people ( to give one of the lower estimates ) . In private , Stepinac did what he could to curb the bloodshed . As early as May 1941 he wrote to Pavelie to protest the murder of 260 Serbs at Glina . He ordered his nuns to care for the children of Partisans . He supervised the care and protection of hundreds of Jews who would otherwise have died in extermination camps . Nevertheless , Stepinac must take some of the blame for the frightful civil war in Yugoslavia , which went on parallel with the war against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ferocity , as well as in numbers killed , with the worst in modern history . It was Tito 's supreme achievement that from 1945 till his death lie managed to bind together a disparate country and even produce a national Yugoslav pride . T HIS unification started with brute force . The communist Partisans shot the Ustashi and their Serbian counter-parts , the Chetniks , though most of the Chetniks were honest patriots and could not be called either Fascists or racial murderers . After the war , Ante Pave/i6 escaped to South America but the Chetnik leader Drazha Mihailovie was put on trial and sentenced to death . Even shortly after the war ended , when tempers ran high , Tito was not vindictive toward his enemies . In particular he did not want to fall out with Archbishop Stepinac , and tried to get him to back the new regime . When Stepinac refused , Tito tried to get him replaced through the papal nuncio . Only when this failed , and Stepinac persisted in speaking out against the regime , did Tito put him on trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it must be said for the Yugoslav communists that . unlike their comrades to theeast , they did not torture and brainwash their prisoners into making staged confessions . Archbishop Stepinac , like Drazha MihailoviC in Serbia . made a moving speech from the dock in which he assured the court and convinced most Catholics that his conscience was clean about what had passed in the war . He was sentenced to sixteen years ' imprisonment . After a time he was allowed to go back to his native village and died there in 1960 . Thanks to Tito , even the trial and imprisonment of Archbishop Stepinac did not exacerbate Serbo-Croat relations . This may have been because Tito himself was a Croat , from the Zagorje region , whose strange accent accounts for the rumor , prevalent in the war , that he was a Russian or some kind of foreigner . It may be that Tito had some residue of Catholic feeling . According to Djilas , a nun was Tito 's nurse during his first serious illness thirty years ago , and he was heard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the end of all things . At any rate , Tito dealt tactfully with the Catholic Church , allowed it freedom of expression ( even to uttering anticommunist statements ) , and removed irritants such as opposition to theological schools . While the prewar Yugoslav monarchy was at daggers drawn with the Vatican , Tito signed a concordat and got on well with recent popes . After his death , an official of the new collective leadership visited Rome and invited Pope John Paul II to visit Yugoslavia in 1984 . The Yugoslav Catholic Church in return proved loyal to Belgrade and ceased its former flirtation with Croat separatism . It has denounced the Ustashi , who still carry on from West Germany and Australia , and have committed several acts of terrorism . When an element of the Croat communist party , backed by university students , demonstrated during the 1960s against what it saw as Serbian hegemony , the church stayed out of the quarrel . It is , by its nature , anti-Marxist but it is no longer antiYugoslay. and , like the Polish church , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year , however , a savage quarrel arose over the grave of Stepinac . The president of the presidium of Croatia , Jakov Blazevie ' , is an old communist war-horse whose one claim to fame is that as a young man he was public prosecutor at Stepinac 's trial . Like many old politicians , he recently published his memoirs , which include a recapitulation of the trial featuring himself as the wise , just , brilliant attorney and Stepinac as the sly , shifty fascist in the dock . Stepinac is described , in Stalinist prose , as the son of a " kulak " and lickspittle of bourgeois reaction . To make matters worse , Mr. Blazevic went on the radio on January 27 of this year to launch his book and denounced Stepinac , the present archbishop of Zagreb. the Catholic clergy , and even the laity . He called the Croat Catholics in Australia the " dregs of society . " The church responded in kind . More than 800 clergymen voted unanimously to defend their present archbishop . Seven thousand people packed Zagreb Cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marble shrine covered with flowers and thanksgiving messages for cures he is said to have wrought . Pilgrims now visit the shrine of a martyr . The authorities , in their turn ? using the pretext of falling masonry ? have plastered the cathedral with skull-and-crossbones signs and warnings : DANCER OF DEATH ENTRANCE FORBIDDEN . This quarrel between a communist and the church has come at the worst possible time for Yugoslavia . Events in Poland can only remind the Yugoslays , who need no reminder , of the persistent danger of Soviet military might : several minority groups within the country are restive and one , the Albanians , is in revolt : the economy goes from had to worse and could reach trouble of Polish proportions . A revival of Croat separatist feeling , tied to the Catholic Church and possibly backed by the Russians ' . could undo all Tito 's good work . God help Yugoslavia if it falls into the hands of people like , ex-public prosecutor Jakov Wazevic.                @ @ @ @ @
