Genetic Gold <P> To the Editors : <P> Let 's hope that gene splicing March 9 produces happier results than the offspring of some previous discoveries of science and industry . We can do without the equivalents of thalidomide , vinyl chloride , PCB , dioxin , napalm and hydrogen bombs . Genetic engineers have not yet shown themselves to be more reliable or mindful of the outcome of their creations than their industrial predecessors . <P> Jeffrey Boone Miller San Francisco <P> The gene splicers have let the genie out of the bottle . But they will not bring peace or prosperity . For if bacteria can consume oil spills in peace , they can certainly eat an enemy 's fuel supply in war . In a nation already at the mercy of its energy supply , what better way to be destroyed by a foe ? <P> Gerald E. Anderson Los Angeles <P> I thought I was quite well informed on genes and chromosomes . <P> I know somewhat of E. coli , of Mendel 's laws and clones . <P> I know recombinant DNA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it very clear I sure do n't know so much . <P> This genetic engineering , with its adenine , cytosine , Hybridomas and lambda phage , thymine and guanine-Why disturb my microbial balance , or give orders to my cells To duplicate and replicate whatever biotechnology tells ? <P> Ididn ' t know myplasmids were engaged in replication , Or obsessed with " sexual dalliance " that they term conjugation ! With just unisex , it was bad enough : why , the only ways and <P> means <P> Of sorting out the boys from girls was by lowering their genes . <P> Charles D. Perry Tuscaloosa , Ala . <P> If genetic engineers can find the key to growing new teeth , they will have done a great deed for humankind . <P> William Morgan New York City <P> Judging the Lady <P> The charges and verdict in the Jean Harris case seemed harsh March 9 . If she and Tarnower had been ordinary people , she would not have been convicted of second-degree murder . Jean Harris ' position in society convicted her . What good is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? She is no threat to anyone . <P> Betty Simon Canton , Ga . <P> Does Mrs. Harris ' high social standing and upper-class background make Dr. Tarnower 's murder any less a crime ? Many women survive bad affairs , withstanding mental , even physical abuse , without murdering their former lovers . <P> Annette M. Rose Syracuse <P> Dr. Tarnower was responsible for Jean Harris ' jealousy , which is a moderate form of insanity . When she shot Tarnower , she was mildly insane and should not have been found guilty of murder . <P> Ernest G. Pihl Arlington , Mass . <P> <P> American Renewal <P> I am an American student in Taiwan . After reading American Renewal Feb. 23 , I felt that I was not alone in having faith in the recovery of our nation . Admittedly , the U.S. has many problems , but the American system is based on sound concepts . Perhaps all Americans should spend time living in a completely different culture . They would achieve a greater awareness of America 's resources , both natural and human . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy wisely urges resumption of SALT talks and dtente . But it then demands more arms , more CIA intervention and the draft .
