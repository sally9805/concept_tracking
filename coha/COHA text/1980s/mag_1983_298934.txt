A win for Baby Jane 's parents <P> Despite its strong objections to overbearing Big Government , the Reagan Administration has been trying to intervene in the painful private dilemma of a Long Island , N.Y. , couple with an incurably ailing child . Last week Federal District Judge Leonard Wexler , a recent Reagan appointee , threw out the U.S. Justice Department 's unprecedented suit seeking the hospital records of the infant known as Baby Jane Doe . <P> Baby Jane was born six weeks ago with a protruding spinal cord and a host of other congenital defects ; doctors believe she will be almost totally disabled and severely retarded for as long as she lives . After agonized consultations with medical experts and religious counselors , her parents decided not to authorize major surgery that might prolong Baby Jane 's life . A right-to-life activist lawyer sought to force the surgery , but two New York appeals courts and a state children 's agency declined to override the parents . Justice then sued to obtain the records from University Hospital in Stony Brook , N.Y. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbids discrimination against the handicapped . <P> Wexler found " no discrimination , " only a great deal of caring . The hospital has always been willing to do the surgery , he pointed out , and failed to do so " not because Baby Jane Doe is handicapped but because her parents have refused to consent to such procedures . " Wexler concluded that the parents ' decision was a " reasonable " one based on a " genuine concern for the best interests of the child . " <P> Mr. and Mrs. A. , as they are designated in court documents , continue to visit Baby Jane in the hospital , where they feed and try to comfort her . Despite Wexler 's ruling , said her father , " I do n't feel any big celebration is in order yet . " Indeed the Government later announced an appeal . " We 've been in nearly every court but the U.S. Supreme Court , " said Paul Gianelli , lawyer for the parents . " And we 've won , but . . . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
