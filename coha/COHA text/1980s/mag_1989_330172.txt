Q. Why did you discontinue Bloom County ? <P> A. I 'm 32 . That 's too young to coast . I could draw Bloom County with my nose and pay my cleaning lady to write it , and I 'd bet I would n't lose 10% of my papers over the next 20 years . Such is the nature of comic strips . Once established , their half-life is usually more than nuclear waste . Typically , the end result is lazy , rich cartoonists . There are worse things to be , I suppose . . . lazy and poor comes to mind . <P> Q. What is your new strip , Outland , about ? <P> A. Silliness . Friendship . Escape . Doorways in the sky . A little girl . A big mouse . Crimson skies . Blue clouds . Liposuction . Love . Death . Trump . Disney . The usual things . <P> Q. What are its chances of succeeding ? <P> A. Slim . I am competing with the readers ' affection for a dead strip whose body is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to be in a mood for anything but the old meadow and dandelions . But until I am booted off the page , I am having a ball . My relatives , of course , think my mind went out with last week 's meat loaf . <P> Q. You are also writing a humorous column for Boating magazine . What is it about ? <P> A. It 's about doing to boaters what I tried to do to everyone else in Bloom County : reveal the lunacy we pretend is n't there . I , of course , would normally have nothing to do with things like boats , but for research reasons I had to buy one . Four , actually . <P> Q. In Bloom County , you portray reporters as lecherous , scurrilous , lying fiends . Do you really think they are that bad ? <P> A. I never said " fiends " per se . " Bloodsucking geckos , " I 've said . Look , the Russians are wimping out and we 're running out of bad guys . If the alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll always go with the ones who dress the funniest . Have you seen George Will 's little bow ties ? <P> Q. Whom would you rather associate with , boaters or reporters ? <P> A. I would rather associate with dogs . <P> Q. Does making fun of the political system change anything ? <P> A. Only the size of cartoonists ' egos . Nowadays political commentary , especially satirical commentary , is usually ink wasted . Eighty years ago that was n't the case . At that time a political cartoonist could turn an election around . Before TV , before movies and radio , a drawing of a weasel with the Governor 's name on his butt went a long way in a public 's imagination . Our political power today is illusionary . A Johnny Carson monologue is today 's real influence brokerage . <P> Q. You have made a difference , though , when it comes to animal testing . After you ran a series on the torturing of rabbits at Mary Kay labs , the cosmetic manufacturer announced a moratorium on animal testing . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction . With the issue of horrendous animal abuse within cosmetic testing labs , all that was needed was to illustrate the facts . When I drew a rabbit with clips pulling its eyelids open , it was effective precisely because of its accuracy . <P> Q. How do you see the environment as an issue ?
