In 1980 a remarkable amount of press coverage was given to a rumored affair between the young Ms. Cunningham and her boss and mentor , Bendix chairman Bill Agee . There were a syndicated six-part series , front-page stories , continued coverage in major newspapers and weekly magazines - all to explore the alleged affair and the part it played in this attractive woman ' s rapid promotion at Bendix. // The whirlwind of implication upset personal lives . It also raised critical issues : Shouldn ' t a woman ' s achievements be judged on merit and not on appearance ? How can a woman on the road to success protect herself from a Bendix scenerio ? Should the board interfere with office romance ? // Four years later , these issues haven ' t gone away . All the more reason for Ms. Cunningham to speak out. // She has been doing so - at her alma mater , at women ' s and executive ' s clubs , before distinguished economic groups. // Now she and Fran Schumer have tried to sum it all up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really Happened at Bendix. ' ' // ' ' Power Play ' ' is the kind of book that makes you wince at the potential it has but never fully achieves . There are successful parts to this book , and they occur when the authors allow the events to point to the issues . In the prologue , Ms. Cunningham cites the issues as the prime reason behind the book : ' ' There ' s a lesson - lessons - in this entire experience that ought to be made clear . The sexual accusations are serious ones . They can ruin personal lives and they can ruin careers . . . . That ' s why I ' m writing the book. ' ' // There ' s an audience ready to hear what she has to say about her experiences as a student at the Harvard Business School , and about her first interview with Mr. Agee , her initial introduction to the Bendix officers , her responsibilities there , and just why the board asked for her resignation - and got it - in October 1980. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when Ms. Cunningham lets the facts speak for themselves. // For instance , her first major project for Agee , a month-long study on the company pension plan , received rave reviews from the chairman . However , she asked Agee to have the Bendix head of finance present the report before the board , because ' ' I was tired of being disliked . ' ' The board loved it , and the head of finance took the praise - until Agee pointed to the real source . She stops the story there . The discomfort and politicking are obvious ; she doesn ' t really need to elaborate. // But too often , especially in the second half of the book , the focus shifts from the events to Mary Cunningham , herself - her anger , her grief , and her recovery , which eventually led to her marriage to Mr. Agee. // To an extent , we need to understand these things ; otherwise we can ' t grasp the full import of the circumstances . But the incredible detail of her personal life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical effect of her ordeal with the media , business associates , and Mr. Agee . Each time she calls her mother for support , we hear about it . Each time she is feeling nauseated , we ' re there. // In the last chapter she writes : ' ' You learn not to deny the pain but to grow from it . In that sense , telling my story was the core of my recovery. ' ' // This kind of soul-baring makes the story come off as her own therapy treatment instead of a legitimate treatment of a legitimate complaint. // The melodramatic high school diary writing only makes things worse : // ' ' I felt like an insect imprisoned under a jar . At first the walls of the jar seem like protection but then they begin to seem like barriers . I felt that this protective jar was starting to suffocate me . But I didn ' t know in whose hand this horrible jar was . Was it the company ' s ? The board ' s ? Agee ' s ? My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuff me out ? ' ' // This kind of writing presents an immature Mary Cunningham . What ' s more , for all her abhorence of the accusations people made against her , ' ' Power Play ' ' shows her quite capable and willing to shoot some right back , and in none-too-pleasant terms. // Yet this does not sound like the Mary Cunningham who now faces the public . In a recent interview , she was controlled , graceful , articulate , impressive . That control seems to have extended into her present business life . Since her short career at Joseph E. Seagram &; Sons Inc. and Mr. Agee ' s aborted attempt to lead Bendix in a takeover of Martin Marietta , the two have started their own venture capital and consulting firm , Semper Enterprises. // To this reader , the meaningful sections of the book are those that deal with the first half of the title : power play. // The sections that must mean a lot to the author are those that address the title ' s other half : what really happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name , and the book is chock full of testimony defending her character . One full chapter is devoted to her upbringing under the influence of her uncle , a Roman Catholic priest . She was always ' ' such a good girl ' ' as a child , and she constantly cites instances in adult life to substantiate her morality. // Her case is convincing , but does that really matter to anyone else but her ? Ms. Cunningham may think she has something to prove , but her responsibility to readers is to point out where she stumbled and help others step clear. // It is in a short , final chapter that she manages to do this , discussing her mistakes and what she learned from them . These observations would carry more weight if they were made throughout the book , instead of popping up briefly at the end . But they are valuable nonetheless . Here are her conclusions : // She stayed too long at Bendix , ignoring the warning signals because of unbalanced loyalty to the company . She was ' ' extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She should have reported to other people besides Agee . She lacked self-confidence. // ' ' So eager was I to prove to everyone else that I could do the job , ' ' she writes , ' ' that I hardly stopped to consider that it was my very competence that threatened them. ' ' // //
