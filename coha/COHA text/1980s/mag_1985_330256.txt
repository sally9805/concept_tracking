Caspar Weinberger 's opinion was blunt and harsh . Asked how the four suspects in the Walker spy scandal should be punished if found guilty , the Defense Secretary replied , " They should be shot , " adding that he supposed " hanging is the preferred method . " Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , who introduced a bill to make spying for money punishable by death , was even more draconian . " If there is an execution , it should be public and on television , " he said . " I want the widest possible visibility of this kind of crime ( to ) deter people who may be starting down this road . " <P> John A. Walker Jr. , his son , brother and California accomplice need not worry about execution for their years of espionage while in the Navy . At present , the maximum penalty for spying in peacetime is life imprisonment ; both Weinberger and Stevens knew that a harsher sentence could not be imposed retroactively . Nevertheless , the Defense Secretary 's comment indicated how Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . Weinberger 's outrage at the spy scandal was also directed toward a more practical purpose : he ordered the military to eliminate 10% of the security clearances currently issued to 4.3 million uniformed and civilian personnel . Navy Secretary John Lehman was ready to go even further . Said Lehman : " We want to reduce ( security clearances ) by half . We are starting with an immediate 10% reduction . " <P> Lehman last week ordered tighter security procedures in all Navy units . Among other things , he reminded commanders to heed a requirement long on the books but often ignored : two persons must participate in the destruction of classified material . John Walker 's son Michael is accused of filching classified documents out of a burn bag while serving as a seaman on the aircraft carrier Nimitz . <P> Weinberger and Lehman made their proposals after a formal assessment of the damages caused by the family-and-friend spy ring . The good news , the Navy said last week , was that the U.S. fleet of ballistic-missile submarines ( SSBNs ) , the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear deterrent , seems secure . Admiral James Watkins , Chief of Naval Operations , said SSBN tactics and equipment have changed greatly in the 18 years since John Walker served on two nuclear subs . " We remain convinced that our SSBN force is still 100% survivable , " he said . <P> The bad news , in contrast , came in bunches . With possible access to U.S. teletype and voice communications systems , Watkins said , the Soviets gained " the ability to better understand what they observed " of U.S. naval maneuvers . This may have helped the U.S.S.R. shorten the American technological lead in antisubmarine warfare . Naval tactics and capabilities in air and surface warfare were compromised as well . Fortunately , the Chief of Naval Operations said , much of the information that might have passed to the Soviets was " perishable , " coding systems that are constantly changed and hence of little use to an enemy . The main damage was done , Watkins added , in compromising the communications systems .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
