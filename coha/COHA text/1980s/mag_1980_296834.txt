ROUGH CUT <P> Directed by Don Siegel Screenplay by Francis Burns <P> Burt Reynolds , everybody 's favorite Everyman , has often expressed his desire to become the Cary Grant of the ' 80s . Lesley-Anne Down , with her Cool Whip body and a mouth that seems always on the verge of an indecent proposal , must have been told she could be the next Grace Kelly . Don Siegel , who makes diamond-hard action movies , has always wanted to direct an elegant , light-fingered comedy like the Grant-Kelly To Catch a Thief . For all anyone knows , Ernest Borgnine wishes he were Fred Astaire . But wishes are n't horses-and if they were , Rough Cut would be an also-ran . <P> Larry Gelbart 's original script-about a couple of high-society crooks , their $30 million heist and the wily Scotland Yard inspector ( David Niven ) who dogs their trail-may have meant to revive the old Hitchcock tradition of sophisticated comedy . But so frail a genre is more style than substance , and Siegel 's trooper-boot direction flattens out the laugh lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an airport runway . Gelbart was smart enough to remove his name from the credits ( hence the screenwriter pseudonym ) . Reynolds was not so lucky . <P> His all-American good humor seems forced here - as if he had wandered into his own funeral and resolved to brazen it out . - By Richard Corliss
