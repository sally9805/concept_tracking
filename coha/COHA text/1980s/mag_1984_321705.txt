COVER STORIES <P> As elections near , much more is at stake than who becomes Prime Minister <P> Yaacov Zvieli squints at the cotton fields prospering under the sun and remembers what it was like at the beginning . How , as a skinny youth barely 20 , he left his parents in Poland and in 1932 came to what was then called Palestine , carrying the Zionist dream of a Jewish homeland . How he and other fervid believers founded the Negba kibbutz in 1939 , digging wells and building huts on an arid patch 30 miles south of Tel Aviv . How he and his comrades , armed only with Molotov cocktails and a handful of shells , held off a dozen Egyptian tanks in 1948 , that exhilarating year in which the state of Israel was created . <P> Today Israel is 36 years old , and Zvieli is 72 . He proudly describes how Negba , like his country , has flourished . The kibbutz now covers 2,500 acres and is home for 330 adults and 600 children . Negba boasts not just pear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but factories that make clothes and plastic bags . Zvieli , an accountant for one of the factories , is asked how things are going . " Not bad , " he responds , " but the high interest is eating up profits . " Zvieli pauses , pondering the larger dimensions of a question that could be asked about Israel itself . " I prefer not to get into politics , " he says cautiously . " But I am disappointed by what is happening to our state . " <P> How are things going ? Ask that question , and no two answers will be exactly alike . Behind the replies , however , there is disquiet , a nagging sense that somehow the country has lost its way , that its biblical promise to be a " light to the nations " has dimmed . The recurrent theme is that a nation born of ideals has , in its attempt to survive and flourish , lost its grip on the destiny that made it special ; that Israel has become just another nation , flawed and fallible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jerusalem cafes , Israelis echo what one of their best-known novelists , Amos Oz , plaintively asked in his book In the Land of Israel : " What will become of us ? What can be done ? " <P> Israel has , with good reason , always been an anxious nation . It has had to contend with neighbors at times so viciously hostile that the young country 's existence was constantly threatened . Now , paradoxically , Israel is physically more secure than ever : of its four Arab neighbors , only Syria is a military menace . Yet that has not translated into psychological security . Three dozen years after its birth , Israel faces problems never imagined by Yaacov Zvieli and other founders . " We now disagree among ourselves on everything , " says Major General Israel Tal , the father of his country 's tank industry . " It is not the environment that has changed or the political realities . It is we who have changed .

" <P> Israelis look inward and wonder . <P> How independent is a country whose economy is sustained by a vast infusion of foreign aid ? What are the consequences for a people , so often the victims of terrorism , when a few of their own are discovered resorting to similar ugliness ? How does
