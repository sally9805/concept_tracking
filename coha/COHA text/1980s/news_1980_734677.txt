txt PREMATURELY silver-haired George " Sparky " Anderson brings his tempestuous Tiger kittens to Chicago Friday for the first time this season . Ana wnue me 4o-year-oia Anaerson was the object of his players ' snarls only a month ago , the predominant sounds currently emanating from the Tiger lair are purrs of satisfaction . It has been just over a year since Sparky la baseball arch-conservative who makes Ronald Reagan look like the president of the Ted Kennedy Fan Club came to the Motor City after being sacked by the Cincinnati Reds . The transition was not an easy one : from veterans to kids ; from philosophical right to left . AND SPARKY WAS N'T used to the steady barrage of clubhouse carping that came from certain Tigers during the team 's early-season problems . " In Cincinnati , there was n't the problem of cleaning out the rats , " Anderson said a few weeks ago . them : Pitcher Jack Billingham was traded from Cincinnati to Detroit during Anderson 's tenure with the Reds . Billingham was traded from Detroit to Boston during Anderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dissenters is to isolate the problem , to treat it like a cancer and eliminate it , " said Anderson . " But you have to pick your spot ; you have to get some value out of those you want to eliminate . " Item : The Tigers traded first baseman Jason Thompson to California for outfielder Al Cowens this month . An official of the Kansas City Royals , where Cowens played in 1979 , said the Tigers turned down a Cowens-for-Thompson deal last season , " I WILL NOT ALLOW had apples in my barrel , " Sparky said before sending the Tigers out for a Friday night game at Comiskey Park . " I will always try to clean out the bad apples before they infect the rest of the barrel . " But the funny truth of the matter is that we had any bad apples on this team , they 're still here . I did n't clean them out ; I cleaned them up . " Because I 'll tell you one thing : Billingham and Thompson were n't the big clubhouse complainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jack Billingham would n't do one thing to hurt a manager or a player . There 's no underhanded stuff in his makeup . Look , Jack and I can still sit down and talk ; we 're friends . But friendship has nothing to do with ability . " AND THOMPSON was n't one of the backstabberS , either . We simply had to trade for a right-handed hitter , and he just got caught in the crossfire . Our lineup became so lefthanded , espedially after we lost Lynn Jones for the year with torn knee cartilage , that we were just inviting other teams to use nothing but lefties against us . " When Cowens became available this year , we had to use Jason to get him . And if Cowens was available for Jason a year ago , then I 'm certainly unaware of the fact . " The change from managing a veteran Cincinnati club to directing the youthful Tigers has been like night and day for Anderson . And now , he said , he feels like he 's in the sunshine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual managing , like I used to do in the minors . I 'm more involved ; I 'm back in the middle of baseball again . " I OVERDID THINGS at first ; I wanted to turn things around overnight . But now I 've calmed down , and everything is running smoothly . " We 've got some good young talent on this team : pitchers like Jack Morris and Pat , lhiderwood and Dan Petry , and , of course , the big guy rookie center fielder Kirk Gibson , currently on the disabled list . " Take Gibson , for instance . I do n't play him against many good lefthanded pitchers because he just is n't ready to hit them . And on the days the other team has a lefty starting , he 'll take one look at the lineup card and really get himself in a mood if he ai n't playing . " I pulled him for a pinch-hitter the other night , when a lefty reliever came in , and he fixed me with a look all the way back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I loved every second of it .
