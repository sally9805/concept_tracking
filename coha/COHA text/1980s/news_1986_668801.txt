Q-My wife and I were planning to buy a home . But then I read an article that said home ownership is not such a smart investment because the mortgage interest tax deduction is worth less than under the old tax law . I ' m not sure if we will be in the new 15 or 28 percent income tax bracket . But since the home prices in our town have risen considerably recently , do you think we should wait to buy ? A-It ' s always a good time to buy a home . Despite the new tax law , today ' s lower mortgage interest rates compensate for the loss of income tax savings . Suppose you find a $100 , 000 home you can buy for $10 , 000 cash down payment and you can qualify for a 30-year $90 , 000 mortgage at 10 percent fixed interest . Your monthly mortgage payment will be about $790 . To keep the numbers simple , let ' s estimate your tax-deductible property tax at $100 per month to make your total monthly payment about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your mortgage payments in the early years are tax deductible interest , if you are in the new 28 percent tax bracket the $890 deduction will save you about $249 per month in income tax . If you are in the new 15 percent bracket , your monthly income tax savings will be about $133 . That means your after-tax housing payment will be about $641 or $757 , depending on the tax bracket . But there ' s another benefit of buying a home . That is the appreciation in market value , currently at a national average of about 8 percent . Even when mortgage interest rates were high , homes continued to appreciate about 5 percent annually in value . Let ' s suppose your $100 , 000 home only appreciates 5 percent annually in market value . That is a $5 , 000 annual " profit " of $416 each month . But this increased value is like a forced savings account since you can ' t spend it until you eventually either sell or refinance . However , as a percentage return on your $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 annual appreciation is a 50 percent return . Q-Now that Congress has taken away the tax shelter incentives for investing in income property , do you think I should sell my apartment buildings ? The only reason I kept them was the tax shelter for my job income . Since I earn over $150 , 000 , I won ' t get any tax shelter deduction . Should I sell ? A-I hope you didn ' t buy the income properties for the tax shelter benefits alone . The tax advantages were just bonus benefits whereas the major reason for buying should have been long-term capital appreciation . If your apartments are in a bad area and are not increasing in market value , then perhaps you should sell . But if your apartments are going up in value as rent raises increase their net income , then I don ' t see any reason to sell . Loss of the tax shelter alone is not a sound reason to sell . Q-We recently bought a run-down house " as is . " We knew that means " watch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warranties and won ' t pay for repairs . However , we bought during dry weather . When the first rains came , the crawl space flooded . Our house now smells musty and damp . The neighbors tell us the sellers often complained of this problem , which will be expensive to correct . Do you think the seller or real estate agent should have told us even though we bought the house " as is ? " A-Yes . The law on " as is " sales is still developing in many states . But it seems pretty well settled that even in " as is " sales the seller and real estate agent must disclose any known defects , just as they must in " regular sales . " However , the buyer ' s big problem is proving the seller knew or should have known of the defect . That can be a difficult legal hurdle to overcome . Consult a real estate attorney but don ' t get your hopes up too high . Q-In the last month we have received four letters from local banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home equity loan . " They will loan us up to 80 percent of our home ' s market value , after subtracting our first mortgage balance . Do you think this type of loan is a good deal ? A-Home equity loans are really just second mortgages . Some offer credit lines so you don ' t pay any interest until you write a check to borrow the money . Of course , don ' t borrow the money unless you have a good use for the funds . And remember , under the new tax law , on home loans obtained after Aug. 16 , 1986 , only interest up to your cost basis is tax deductible unless the funds are used for home improvements , medical , or educational expenses . Q-About three years ago I sold my five-unit apartment building and carried back a $56 , 000 second mortgage . The borrower is now two months behind on the loan payments . I have started foreclosure . Is there any way I can stop this woman from milking the property by keeping all the rent money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a receiver to collect the rents and manage the property . Q-We got swindled on our home purchase and want to know what we should do . When the seller moved out , she took the beautiful dining room chandelier and replaced it with a $10 bedroom light fixture , removed the built-in dishwasher , took up the wall-to-wall carpets , and replaced the drapes with cheap curtains . Also , the practically new stove and refrigerator were replaced with old models . Our sales contract clearly says all window coverings , fixtures , and wall-to-wall carpets are included . The seller has moved out of state and the real estate agent says " it ' s not my problem . " What should we do ? A-Consult your attorney . Unfortunately , your situation occurs too frequently . After the sale closes , the buyer loses leverage over the seller . Your best bet is to contact the real estate agent ' s broker to work out a fair settlement . Be prepared with cost estimates for replacing the missing items . If you can ' t reach a settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agent since the seller is beyond local court jurisdiction . Please note : Real estate laws differ from place to place , and laws of your area should be checked before making decisions on real estate problems .
