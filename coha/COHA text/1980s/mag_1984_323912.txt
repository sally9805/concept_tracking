Misunderstood for 31 years <P> When David Tom , a frail young Chinese immigrant in his early 20s , was first admitted to an Illinois mental institution in 1952 , all he was able to say in English was " Me no crazy . This nuthouse . " <P> No one listened . Worse , he was never examined by anyone who could speak Chinese . Nearly three decades went by before anyone even tried to understand . In 1978 , a social worker at a mental hospital in Manteno , Ill. , took Tom to a Chinese restaurant , where he had a conversation in Cantonese dialect with the cook . There was nothing wrong with Tom , the cook told the hospital staff , setting in motion a four-year battle in the state courts to win his release . Tom 's long nightmare had begun when , suffering from tuberculosis , he was admitted to a sanatorium . Because what he said seemed incomprehensible , he was later diagnosed as a retarded schizophrenic . <P> Last week David Tom , now 54 , was finally released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court-appointed public guardian , Patrick Murphy , said , " He 's got his freedom now , and if he gets a little happiness on top of that , he 'll be lucky . " An engaged couple , Peter Porr and San O , who run a center in Chicago for Indochinese immigrants , answered Murphy 's appeal for a home for Tom after his release . In the mornings Tom will attend literacy classes , and in the afternoons he will try to learn his way around the outside world . <P> " He does pretty well , considering the stress he 's been under for the past 31 years , " says Porr . <P> Tom and his brother Richard entered the U.S. in 1951 as illegal aliens . Richard testified in court that he knew his brother was not insane , but he did not step forward to help David because he feared deportation . A jury award of $205,000 to David as compensation may " cover the costs of caring for him for the rest of his life , " says Murphy . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through . You do n't learn anything from a case like Tom 's . It 's just a tragedy , pure and simple . "
