To me , there are dishes that are ideal for this time . They are cold or room-temperature foods that are appropriate for yet another picnic or for situations that call for something more elegant . None are complicated and all can be made in advance , which is a boon to the busy host or hostess . And each one has a special connotation , a longtime association with times past . These are dishes that conjure up pleasant memories of travels abroad or of a Southern childhood. // In early youth , my idea of heaven was a trip to New Orleans . These visits , which were rare , occasionally included a stop at Ar-Recipes are on page C8. naud ' s , a restaurant in the French Quarter . The meals there were unforgettable and the most memorable dish of all was the shrimp remou lade , a fiery and delicious concoction that I would eat slowly and carefully , savoring each mouthful. // At Arnaud ' s the shrimp remoulade was made with Creole mustard - Zatarain ' s is the best brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely chopped green onion and a good grade of oil . Paprika gave it a touch of spice and a fine red color . I have re-created this dish often in the summers since ; it is a pleasure that endures . One note , though : I have found from experience that the remoulade is much better if the shrimp are marinated in that sauce overnight to give them the proper texture and depth of flavor. // Sandwiches have rarely received their due , a regrettable omission since I can think of several that are among my favorite things to eat . At the top of my sandwich list is ripe tomato and mayonnaise on white bread . Alas , the time for the best tomatoes has passed , but I have three other choices that will do just fine for a Labor Day feast . They are cucumber , watercress and red onion . All three are made on white bread lightly smeared with mayonnaise and , in my kitchen , they inevitably come in three shapes . The cucumber blend is turned into finger sandwiches , the watercress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dined on the cucumber and watercress sandwiches years ago , sitting at tea in the grand old Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. // Onion sandwiches might , at first mention , sound like another offering from the culinary school that gave us the peanut butter and potato chip sandwich . I can assure you they are not . The properly constructed onion sandwich is a delicacy to which I was introduced by the late James Beard , who became identified with it , though he was always careful to credit the invention to a colleague , Irma Rhode . To make an onion sandwich , onion slices are put between rounds of bread spread with mayonnaise ( ideally it should be thin-sliced brioche ) ; then mayonnaise is spread on the outside and the sandwich is rolled in finely chopped parsley. // On a flight to Italy some years ago , I was served a dreadful dish of overcooked pasta with tomato sauce . It was so bad that I was determined not to chance having it on the return trip from Milan . My solution was to visit a splendidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s , which packaged a single roast quail stuffed with prosciutto and rosemary . That , along with red wine and cheese , provided a delightful cold meal on the flight back to New York . Since that trip , I have thought of roast game hen served in this manner as an ideal picnic dish. // To me , no picnic is complete without some form of hard-cooked stuffed eggs . So devoted am I to this notion that friends often chide me good-naturedly about it . I reluctantly concede that by this point in the summer , plain old deviled eggs may have worn out their welcome . So it is time to use a little imagination . How about mashing the yolks with a little butter and anchovy paste ? Or combining them with sliced olives and ham , or sardines ? I recently received a package of imported salami , so the recipe offered here , a new one , incorporates it , with highly satisfying results. // The last dish in this Labor Day menu is one I first sampled in Switzerland more than 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of tomato paste for color and flavor and a small dash of Cognac for zest . With any of these foods a well-chilled chenin blanc or a dry white wine from Macon would be most appropriate .
