 | Thousands of people pass the old Times Tower on the south side of New York 's 42nd Street each week without realizing that it 's not what it pretends to be . But those with long memories will scratch their heads . Did n't the Times Tower used to be somewhere else ? on the north side of 42nd , where a slick white tower now stands ? If you look closer , you can spot the truth . The Times Tower facade , rich with long , sweeping arches , columns , ornate friezes and dark shadows is . . . a painted mural ! And that famous red sign reading " Times " in Old English script is nothing more than a charming painted lie . Similar deceptions occur throughout the city . In Soho , the artists ' district , the barren side of an old cast-iron building has been painted to duplicate a fanciful facade of classical columns and rows of tall windows , two of which are real , thus compounding the building 's devilish illusions . And in the old South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jest that tops them all . Painted on the side of a nondescript power station is a magnificent Federal-style building flanked by a wondrous arcade . The arcade opens out onto a view of the soaring Brooklyn Bridge just beyond . Above it rises the real Brooklyn Bridge itself , giving away the whole game . The man behind these civic jokes is artist Richard Haas , who is the latest and most grandiose ? exponent of the ancient tradition of trompe 1'oeil ( fool the eye ) painting . Haas , 45 , paints out of a love for buildings that goes back to his childhood . In his teens he worked as a carpenter at Taliesin , Frank Lloyd Wright 's headquarters in Wisconsin . Haas calls his work an " Architecture of Illusion " ? the title of an impressive new book just published by Rizzoli ( 160 pages . $35 ) that includes Haas 's own account of his esthetic . ( It is also the name of a recent exhibition of his prints , maquettes and drawings at the Urban Center in Manhattan . ) Haas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are really meant to guide the teams of sign painters who execute his murals . Haas works primarily on commission from architects and community groups , both in the United States and abroad . In 1978 the American Institute of Architects gave him a medal for " outstanding art and craftsmanship . " Dumbfounded : Though he began his New York career as a painter and printmaker in the early ' 70s , creating faithful renditions on paper of the rich Victorian cast-iron facades that cover Soho , Haas is really a kind of architect who must be judged for his impact on the city landscape . When he showed his first richly articulated architectural drawings to his students and colleagues , they were dumbfounded . It was a time when all self-respecting young painters were producing large color-field abstractions . Recalls Haas : " One of them said , They look like drawings of outer space b Piranesi ' . " He also remembers squirming at a series of lectures given in 1970 by critic Clement Greenberg , the great proponent of formalist abstraction in painting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haas says , " but I decided I did n't . " Haas 's appetite for theatricality was further whetted by an invigorating series of trips to Italy . " I 'd always been fascinated b what I saw in books of baroque and rococo architecture , which is filled with illusion . painted columns , arches and doors . The eighteenth century really turned me on . " @# @#  | When he came back he looked in his own Soho neighborhood for a way to transform his drawings into architecture and " found half a dozen blank walls ready and waiting . " Translating the idea into reality was something else . But City Walls , Inc. , an organization dedicated to promoting murals , was engaged to clear the way for a Prince Street project . Soaring Majesty : The results were immediately positive . The Prince Street " facade " drew large crowds and requests from architects and community groups to paint new ones in New York , Milwaukee , Wis. , and Galveston , Texas . The best offer came from the Boston Architectural Center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its building , which was designed in the ungainly , concrete , " brutalist " manner of the ' 60s . Here Haas took a major step forward . Instead of repeating the style of the building , he invented a totally new design ? a lovely classical dome , complete with arches , columns and balustrades . When this dome is seen from the street below ? rising over the top of an intervening red-brick building ? it not only seems real , it fits neatly into the visual landscape of the city , linking up with famous domes to the east and west ? I. M. Pei &; Partners ' Christian Science Church Center and the old State House . In its soaring majesty , the Boston fantasy eclipsed Haas 's early murals , both in scale and imagination . That it also contained a subtle , patently surrealistic element was further evidence that Haas had moved sharply away from the early murals , which simply repeated details found elsewhere on the facade or in the neighborhood . There is a " secret narrative " in the Boston wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following each other . One of them is at the bottom of the wall , one behind a door on the third floor , another inside a small open arch near the top . Haas seems to be echoing the practice of Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini , the great theatrical master of baroque architecture , who believed that imagination reigned supreme over " nature " and " reason " and tried to prove it by forcing the hard stone surfaces of his buildings to shake and quiver , at least in appearance . Haas 's most recent ? and largest ? fabri- cation is just as free-spirited . The new mural looms near the Loop in Chicago , visible for miles around . On three sides of a free-standing apartment building ? more than 80,000 square feet ? Haas has conjured up an elaborate new structure complete with grandentrance arch , bay windows and bas-relief portraits . Haas calls the mural " Homage to the Chicago School , " for it mixes together motifs used by all of the great architects whose faces adorn the arch over the street entrance ? Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnham . Decisive Force : In his recent projects Haas is not just playing visual tricks but dealing with the psychic landscape of the city . When his designs simply fool the eye , when they do n't enhance or instruct the brutal modern city , they are merely decorative . But when they become a convincing urban presence , they are no longer pretenders but a decisive critical force . Seven years ago Haas proposed to paint the " shadows " of certain extraordinary buildings on the facades of newer , blander structures ? for instance , the shadow of the flamboyant Chrysler Building on the stolid World Trade Center . His extraordinary Boston and Chicago projects preach the same pointed lesson . They remind mayors , planners and architects of qualities now sadly missing in our cities . @# NEWSWEEK/FEBRUARY 8 , 1982 75
