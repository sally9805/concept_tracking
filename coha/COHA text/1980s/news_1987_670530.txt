The growing consensus from a wide cross section of officials is that the prospects are dim for a resurgence of his Presidency without an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union or some other major achievement . Their assessment is that Mr. Reagan is unable to cope both personally and politically with a Congress controlled by Democrats as well as with the Iran-contra affair . <> <> ' Something ' s Gone Wrong ' // " Something ' s gone wrong in the last six months or so , " said one recent visitor to the Oval Office , who sees Mr. Reagan frequently . The comment reflected what some others , from legislators to confidants of Mr. Reagan and from White House officials to foreign diplomats , are also saying about him. // Although White House spokesmen and some Republican Congressional leaders sharply disagree , the mood of pessimism , most evident in recent months , goes beyond that which has traditionally encumbered a " lame duck " president. // It is a combination of changes both in the man himself and in the way he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <> <> Depressed by Image Problem // The Iran-contra affair , looming largest among these , is said to have depressed Mr. Reagan in a deeply personal sense . The President ' s slippage in popularity , as reflected in public opinion polls , since the sale of arms to Iran and diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels were disclosed last November , has been troubling to Mr. Reagan because his favorable image among the American public had been something that energized him throughout his political life and provided a source of inner strength . Particularly troublesome is that polls show that more than half the public believes he is lying , aides said. // Another factor in the bleakness seen in the Reagan Presidency is the changing nature of Mr. Reagan ' s relationship with aides . Some associates say the President , having been surprised by the actions of some aides in the Iran-contra affair , is less trusting of them. // In addition , the deaths of some longtime associates , including William J. Casey , former Director of Central Intelligence , have left the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with even fewer confidants here . Further , he has not established the personal rapport with Howard H. Baker Jr. , the new White House chief of staff , that he shared with Donald T. Regan , Mr. Baker ' s immediate predecessor , or with senior White House officials of the first term . <> <> Surgery Said to Take Toll // The new White House staff , under Mr. Baker and Frank C. Carlucci , the national security adviser , has been unable to operate effectively in Congress despite a solid legislative background . Aides , who acknowledge the failure , attribute it to the Democrats ' control of both chambers of Congress for the first time in the Reagan Presidency . But lawmakers cite other factors , including a new aggressiveness by both Republicans and Democrats in opposing the President and a perception of a leadership void. // Mr. Reagan ' s medical problems , which have included major surgery twice in the last two years , have taken a toll. // Aides said the President did not bounce back , as the White House has publicly asserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gland last January . And more than ever he is showing signs of his 76 years , so much so that his memory lapses and rambling discourses are no longer a source of friendly jokes , but one of concern , friends say. // Two small polyps were found Friday in Mr. Reagan ' s colon in a checkup , and today the White House announced that tests had found them to be noncancerous. // Marlin Fitzwater , the White House spokesman , asked about the growing negative consensus about the President , said , " This sounds like political piling on . " <> <> ' The President Is Vigorous ' // " The President is vigorous , actively pursuing our budget reform measures domestically , historic trade legislation , and the first real nuclear arms reduction opportunity ever , " Mr. Fitzwater said . " This an active President , who has overcome some difficulities in recent months and who is determined to make the last 18 months productive and meaningful. " // Mr. Fitzwater added , " There are those who have been waiting six years to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting themselves in the foot to write off Ronald Reagan. " // A similar view was expressed by Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming , the Republican whip in the Senate . " The only change I ' ve noted is that his hair is actually getting grayer , " he said . " I know people say , ' I wonder if he ' s losing it . ' But that ' s not the case . He ' s better now than he ' s ever been . " But other legislators and some Reagan aides say it is clear that Mr. Reagan is now functioning with far less leverage . Gone is the appearance of a confident leader , assured of gathering public support to push his policies through Congress . Instead , for the first time , the President is on the defensive. // Even so , instead of seeking accommodation with Congress in his final two years , particularly in light of a Senate no longer controlled by his party and his weakened Presidency , Mr. Reagan is using the same kind of confrontational approach he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats and dismaying some Republicans . <> <> ' An Unfortunate Signal ' // " Instead of signaling to Congress that he ' s interested in working constructively to produce some real achievements in the last 18 months of his Administration , the President sends a signal of confrontation and combat , " said Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington , the Democratic majority leader. // " There ' s an unfortunate signal here of a President who has accepted his own growing irrelevance and has abdicated the field of working with Congress , " he said. // While Republican supporters in Congress are less critical , their comments reflect a similar theme . Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , for example , said recently that the President " has obviously been distracted at a key time of the 100th Congress " because of the Iran-contra affair . The Senator expressed concern that budget , military and trade issues have been left floundering. // " Does the President feel bad ? No doubt about it , " said Mr. Grassley . " He feels ill-treated . He ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Another Republican , Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , said of Mr. Reagan ' s reactions to the Iran-contra affair : " I think he ' s beleaguered by it . I think he ' s on the defensive . I think he ' s preoccupied . Everywhere he goes he ' s asked questions . " <> <> ' There ' s Less Emotion ' // One Republican legislative leader said that in Mr. Reagan ' s meetings with Congressional leaders , " he usually has a script - he reads from his cards . " The lawmaker added : " But some things animate him . If it ' s an issue like taxes - no tax increase - he doesn ' t need cards . But on other things , the State Department budget , for example , that comes off the cards . There ' s less emotion there . " Senator Simpson disagreed . " He ' s actually using less cards and less notes than before , " he said . " I even saw him do a cowboy doodle the other day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . He used to do that when he was in his prime , it was a form of enjoyment. " // Several senior White House officials said the wounds inflicted by the Iran-contra affair had inflicted far more damage than was publicly apparent. // " The thing that really hurts him is the perception on the part of the public that he is not telling the truth , " said one key aide. // A New York Times/CBS News Poll last month found that 55 percent of the American public , a higher level than in earlier polls , believed Mr. Reagan was lying when he said he did not know that money from arms sales to Iran was diverted to help Nicaraguan rebels and that 31 percent said he was telling the truth . The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4 percentage points. // A Times/CBS poll in March , with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points , found that 42 percent of the public approved his handling of his job , a figure that was 30 percentage points higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contends his approval rating has stabilized . <> <> Criticism of Speeches // The evidence of the changes in Mr. Reagan has mostly been observed in private . But public signs are emerging . At a recent news conference , for instance , the President was unable to remember the name of the United Nations Security Council. // Once an effective advocate for his policies , his speeches and public statements have recently become targets of ridicule . Mr. Foley cited the President ' s broadcast speech to the nation three weeks ago as an example , calling it " the single most disappointing speech of his Presidency . " What was especially striking , Mr. Foley said , was that the President " recycled tired issues and old rhetoric , " advancing no new policy ideas. // One ranking Western diplomat who conferred with Mr. Reagan at the economic summit meeting in Venice earlier this month told colleagues that the President had seemed " distracted , " as if he " had his mind on something else . " He " couldn ' t focus on the issues at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official in a foreign government . <> <> ' Mr. Reagan Is Fatigued ' // Another senior foreign diplomat in close contact with Mr. Reagan said " the conventional view " among Western envoys now is that " Mr. Reagan is fatigued , physically and mentally , and doesn ' t have the grit that he had. " // The wide range of officials interviewed singled out the Iran-contra affair as most responsible for Mr. Reagan ' s diminishing zest because it has served as a constant distraction . One aide said , for example , that the President had kept abreast of Congressional hearings far more than has been disclosed. // " The Iran thing has taken a personal toll on the President , I know that , " said a former senior White House official . " He ' s been knocked off his stride . He ' s stunned by the Watergate-type revelations. " // He said , " You have to understand - it goes right to the heart and soul of this President " to read that most of the American people " don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It hits him where it hurts most - his popularity . He cares deeply about that . " Another Reagan associate , who has seen the President as the scandal has unfolded over the last eight months , said the effect had been gradual. // " Even when the Iran thing began , he was O.K. , cheerful , joking , telling anecdotes , " this associate said . " But even before Venice when I saw him , the zest had gone out . There was a change . He didn ' t have the same fire and spirit . There was a lack of sparkle . I just find it worrying . " <> <> Diplomat Sees Frailness // Even his firmest supporters , who dispute the contention that the Iran-contra affair has devastated Mr. Reagan personally , concede that it Iran-contra affair has hurt him politically . " It would just be so sad if the Reagan legacy is remembered as a series of incompetent , inept , privatized foreign policy initiatives , " said Representative Henry J. Hyde , Republican of Illinois. // Current and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Reagan seemed compounded by his prostate surgery on Jan. 4 . According to several aides , Mr. Reagan ' s recovery , occurring as the Iran-contra affair escalated , seemed unexpectedly prolonged. // " He looked a lot paler and seemed a lot less energetic than he did even after the cancer surgery , " said one former White House official. // A Western diplomat who met Mr. Reagan weeks after the prostate surgery expressed surprise that the President seemed so " frail , " a view echoed by others. // Summing up the current White House mood , a central player in Mr. Reagan ' s Presidency in the last six years , said : // " We were looking at the last two years of the Presidency as the icing on the cake . Perhaps an arms control agreement to lock in the legacy and assure his place in history. // " In the long run maybe Iran will be a footnote , who knows . But it ' s immobilized the President . It ' s forced him to go on the defensive - so much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
