Financial analysts hailed the move , and even union officials were at least somewhat understanding . Nonetheless , the announcement from General Motors last week sent a powerful shudder of concern through the Midwestern Rustbelt . GM Chairman Roger Smith said that starting next year the giant automaker will begin the largest pruning operation in its 78-year history . As the first stage in that cutback , GM will shut down ten of its plants and partly close another , in Michigan , Illinois , Missouri and Ohio , dismissing no fewer than 29,000 workers over a three-year period . GM billed the action as part of a $10 billion " construction and modernization program " designed to create a " trimmer and more competitive company . " Other shutdowns , warned GM President James McDonald , are " under study . " <P> For any corporation but GM , perhaps , the cutbacks would have to be described as draconian . But the world 's largest automaker has a total of 223 plants , which assembled some 9.3 million cars , trucks and buses last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks for 1986 , and include the company 's oldest factory still in operation , a 67-year- old Cadillac Fleetwood plant in Detroit . As Smith pointed out , six new GM plants , in Michigan , Missouri , Kansas , Indiana and Louisiana ( four open , one due to begin production next month and one scheduled for 1987 ) , have replaced much of the aged capacity . <P> The dismissals represent a permanent net loss of almost 5.7% of GM 's approximately 512,000 hourly and salaried U.S. employees . Even so , United Auto Workers officials sounded resigned as they explained that numerous GM workers with high seniority had earlier been transferred to newer facilities . Some of the remaining released workers will be covered by unemployment benefits that can equal up to 95% of after-tax pay for as long as two years . Michigan Governor James Blanchard , whose state will be socked with seven of the closings , affecting 17,450 workers , decried the cutbacks but acknowledged that they were a " way for GM to accommodate recent expansions . " <P> For GM , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $500 million annually . A more nebulous gain , Chairman Smith hopes , will be the recovery of investor confidence in a company that suffered third-quarter operating losses of $338.5 million . Said Smith last week : " We have progressed to the point where expected efficiencies can begin to pay off . It 's been a long , steady course , and we 're starting to see the sun coming over the horizon . "
