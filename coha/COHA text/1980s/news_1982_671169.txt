In addition , the Mayor said the city would begin enforcing a regulation that requires taxicab drivers to pull within 12 inches of a curb when picking up or discharging passengers in midtown . A spokesman for the taxi industry said that drivers would try to abide by the regulation but that passengers were often the problem. // City Hall blueprints for curtailing traffic congestion are about as common as backups at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel . But Mr. Koch said yesterday that the need for new action was especially urgent because it came in the aftermath of the busiest Christmas season in the busiest Manhattan traffic year on record . <> <> ' Fed Up ' With Illegal Parking // " The severe congestion you experienced this last week will occur year-round unless we take strong measures , " said the Mayor , who was surrounded by charts , diagrams and city officials at a news conference in the Blue Room at City Hall. // A major reason for congestion , he added , is that drivers often park illegally in lanes where traffic should be kept moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim to stop it , " he said. // A driver ' s license is subject to revocation by the State Division of Motor Vehicles if 11 points are accumulated within an 18-month period. // Under the new regulation , illegal parking can be considered a " moving violation " and carry with it two points against a driver ' s license . This penalty will apply only to those who obstruct traffic flow , such as those whose vehicles are double-parked or standing in a bus lane . It does not apply to those who violate other regulations , such as **28;86;TOOLONG parking. // New York State has reciprocal agreements with New Jersey and Connecticut on pursuing those charged with both parking and moving violations . But New York City has concentrated on enforcing penalties for moving violations , which city officials consider more serious. // The new regulation on driver ' s license points will take effect at the end of February , 60 days after it is published in the City Register this Thursday . It will apply throughout the city , although enforcement will be concentrated first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First to Eighth Avenues from 34th to 59th Streets. // The regulation , in effect , broadens the definiton of a moving violation to include vehicles that inhibit others from moving . Samuel I. Schwartz , a deputy city transportation commissioner , said the regulation would discourage " a generation of car sitters " who consider a $40 parking ticket " part of the cost of shopping. " // " When they are threatened with losing their license , " Mr. Schwartz said , " I don ' t think they will be back the next day . " <> <> Ultimate Objective // Anthony Ameruso , the city ' s Transportation Commissioner , said the ultimate objective of all the regulations was to avoid that scourge of city traffic planners - gridlock. // The city will seek legislation in Albany to increase the maximum fine for a parking violation to $100 from the current $50 . The change is being sought to give the city more latitude in adding penalties to initial fines for those who are late in paying them. // Similar legislation was defeated in Albany last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been changed in more than a decade , said they intended to press harder for the increase in the coming session of the Legislature. // The new forklift truck that the city plans to use is already in operation in London , where it is known as the Z-Wagon because of the zigzag shape of its lifting arm. // The Z-Wagon is a flatbed truck with a mechanical arm that can reach out and hoist a car out of hard-to-tow places . Numerous cars are left untouched by tow trucks because they are parked snugly against others , Mr. Ameruso said. // He added that the city hoped to purchase such a vehicle within the next year at a cost of about $70 , 000 . <> <> Fewer Spaces for Diplomats // The city also hopes to eliminate 75 spaces for " authorized vehicles " - including 55 for diplomats - by March 1 in the congested area between Third and Fifth Avenues from 49th to 59th Streets . The other 20 spaces that will be eliminated are for the press , government officials and doctors. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " often disregarded city traffic laws , parked where they pleased and ignored fines . He said that he would not tangle with diplomats who claim special privilege when it comes to fines and regulations , but that the city would continue to tow their cars away. // Even if they do not pay their fines , he added , it is " more than a nuisance " for the diplomats to have to retrieve the vehicles . Mr. Koch said that earlier city parking initiatives - such as bus lanes and towing in midtown - had cut the number of illegally parked cars in half in the last year and had improved the speeds at which city traffic moved. // The Mayor ' s announcement about requiring taxicabs to pull up to the curb is mostly a signal to the taxi industry that he intends to enforce a long-disregarded regulation . Taxis routinely stop wherever there is a passenger , sometimes with seemingly little regard for curbs , let alone pedestrians and other vehicles. // Howard Fogel , the president of the Independent Taxi Owners Council , said his group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that helps move traffic. " // But , he added , the problem is often caused by the passenger and not the drivers . " Sometimes , " he said , " they just jump out of the cab in the middle of the block. " //
