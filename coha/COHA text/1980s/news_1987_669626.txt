Put those figures plus the other accomplishments of this trio together and they come out looking pretty even . But that isn ' t the way they are going to look in this year ' s balloting. // // Pitcher A is Luis Tiant , a newly eligible candidate who , it can be safely assumed , will get only modest support . Pitcher B is Mickey Lolich , who has been on the ballot for several years without receiving much backing , got only 84 votes last year , and seems clearly destined never to make it . But Pitcher C is Jim Bunning , who came close last year with 289 votes and will probably be elected this time. // Why such a tremendous disparity for three hurlers with almost identical records ? Your guess is as good as mine . Furthermore , the same sort of vagaries exist throughout the voting for players at all positions. // There ' s no problem with the out-and-out superstars , of course . They always make it with a sizeable vote - usually in their first year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a player is affected by a great many extraneous factors , such as where he played ; how much publicity he got ; special one-shot achievements like no-hitters , home run records , etc. ; and even gimmicks like a catchy nickname. // Trying to put aside all such considerations and go strictly by achievements , I would definitely vote for Bunning . There ' s no question in my mind that a man who won all those games pitching mostly for relatively weak teams , who is 11th on the all-time strikeout list ( and was 2nd when he retired ) , and who pitched 40 shutouts , including two no-hitters , belongs. // But so does Lolich , whose figures are comparable and who has an additional credential in the form of his spectacular 1968 World Series performance when he won three games , beating the great Bob Gibson in the finale , to lead Detroit past St. Louis. // And ditto for Tiant , who won more games than either of the others , led the American League in shutouts three times and earned-run average twice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 World Series. // Turning to everyday players , the top candidate this year is clearly Willie Stargell , who should gain election in his first year of eligibility . The former Pittsburgh slugger had 475 home runs and 1 , 540 RBIs - both figures far above those of any other candidate - and he too was a World Series star , batting . 400 with three homers in the Pirates ' victorious 1979 appearance . It ' s hard to see how the voters could leave him off , but they ' ve done stranger things over the years , so he ' d better not make his reservations for Cooperstown just yet. // None of this year ' s other new candidates can really be mentioned in the same breath with Stargell or Tiant , but there are still plenty of outstanding holdovers . Unfortunately , the vote totals these players have received in previous years suggest that they have no realistic chance of election , though in some cases it ' s difficult to see why this is so . Certainly several of them have the statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliva , for example . The former Minnesota star was a three-time American League batting champion who hit over . 300 six times and whose . 304 lifetime average is the highest of any current candidate . Or Harvey Kuenn , who won only one batting title but bettered . 300 eight times and finished just behind Oliva with a . 303 career mark. // Neither of these fine hitters has ever received the sort of vote that would indicate they had any chance of eventual election , however , and ditto for base-stealing wizard Maury Wills . Shortstops have generally received less than their due from the voters , who seem overly infatuated with slugging statistics , and Wills has been no exception . The former Los Angeles Dodgers star had a . 281 lifetime batting average , was the first player to steal 100 bases in a season , led the National League in steals six straight years , and got the job done in the field , but is nowhere near the number of votes he would need to get in. // Then there ' s Bill Mazeroski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series-winning home run for which he is primarily remembered . The former Pittsburgh second baseman played 17 solid seasons , performing superbly in the field and contributing solidly to the attack . Catcher-infielder Joe Torre ( . 297 with good power statistics ) and slugger Orlando Cepeda ( . 297 , 379 homers , 1 , 365 RBIs ) are also worth mentioning. // And that hardly exhausts the list of possibilities either , with such other holdover candidates as Dick Allen , Bobby Bonds , Ken Boyer , Elroy Face , Curt Flood , Elston Howard , Don Larsen , Roger Maris , Minnie Minoso , Thurman Munson , Vada Pinson , Ron Santo , and Wibur Wood. // Furthermore , in addition to Stargell and Tiant , the committee making up this year ' s ballot listed 22 other players newly eligible after the five-year waiting period following the end of their careers - though some are pretty far-fetched as Hall of Fame candidates . The list includes Stan Bahnsen , Mark Belanger , Ross Grimsley , Larry Hisle , Al Hrabosky , Grant Jackson , Randy Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Mayberry , Lynn McGlothen , George Medich , John Milner , Manny Mota , Willie Montanez , Ken Reitz , Joe Rudi , Reggie Smith , Jim Spencer , Del Unser , and Rick Wise. // The voting by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America is being conducted between now and Dec. 31 . Each voter can name anywhere from one to 10 choices , and any player named on 75 percent of the ballots is elected , with the results to be announced early next year. // We don ' t really have to wait that long , though , because the results can be predicted right now with a good deal of certainty : Stargell and Bunning , period. // As for my own ballot , I ' ll vote for these two plus the eight others I deem most worthy of consideration , even though it ' s doubtful that many , if any , of them will ever make it : Cepeda , Kuenn , Lolich , Mazeroski , Oliva , Tiant , Torre , and Wills. // //    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
