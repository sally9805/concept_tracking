A problem of Texas-size proportions has prompted a rescue effort just as big . Last week the Federal Government disclosed a sweeping plan to shore up one of the weakest spots in the U.S. financial system : the increasingly insolvent Texas savings and loan industry . Hit first by the oil bust , then a real estate collapse , Texas thrifts lost an estimated $5 billion last year . The salvage scheme proposed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board will drastically reduce the number of independent Texas thrifts , from 281 to less than 180 , by forcing % weak institutions into mergers with stronger ones . Cost of the plan : more than $7 billion over several years . At least $1 billion is expected to come from private investors who want to buy a piece of the thrifts at bargain prices .
