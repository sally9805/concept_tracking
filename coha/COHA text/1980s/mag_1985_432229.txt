 | They hug the outskirts of the old colonial city of Lima like poor relations to a dowager ? the pueblos jovenes , or young towns , of Peru . For decades , the squatters who live in them streamed down from villages in the Andes Mountains in search of prosperity ; finding little , they staged nocturnal " invasions , " seizing idle land and throwing up makeshift housing while the authorities slept . The shantytowns ' aura of transience has since been replaced by a shaky permanence : many now have electricity , running water , schools , a crude justice system and the rudiments of a capitalist economy . To First World eyes the towns may still seem like eyesores , blighted by disease , filth and poverty . But some urban anthropologists detect something else in the towns as well . They call them " slums of hope . " Granted , the hope is faint . Since World War II , many major cities of Latin America have swelled as much as 10 times in size , in part because economic growth lured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaguing many Latin nations has actually accelerated the trend . At the same time , economic stagnation and the effects of the Third World debt crisis have devastated industry , driven up unemployment and left governments helpless to provide many services . The ranks of the poor ? and the population of the shantytowns ? have exploded as a result . Climbing the Ladder : Yet in the midst of the pervasive squalor and crime there is often a curious sense of vitality . It may stem in part from sheer will to survive : many of the shantytowns throughout Latin America have successfully fended off attempts to clear them away , and have even organized themselves to become a powerful force in local politics . Moreover , slums in many countries are a primary locus of the sector informal , the vast underground portion of local economies ; the " informal " economic activity in the slums around Lima , for example , constitutes an estimated one-half of that city 's total output . Among the shanties , a primitive capitalism functions beyond government red tape , regulations and confiscatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many residents ? affording them the opportunity to scale part way up the economic ladder , one shaky rung at a time . Wilmer Rodas , 30 , was a young peasant from northern Peru when relatives told him about a squatters ' invasion preparing to take over some state-owned land in Lima . One night he and others founded the " young town " of Pamplona Alta , carving out lots for their houses and community facilities with lines drawn in the sandy soil . @# The squatters had to resist repeated eviction attempts by the police , then fight for deeds to the land and public services from municipal authorities . They won ? and Pamplona Alta has become such a force in local politics that it recently helped elect Lima 's Marxist mayor and Peru 's moderate-left president , Alan Garcia . Rodas , meanwhile , has become something of an entrepreneur . Tired of erratic paychecks from his old employer , a metalworking company , he bought an electric welding machine with his life savings and went into business for himself . In his roofless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pamplonans and is fashioning the windows and doors of a new neighborhood chapel . Rodas says he earns enough to support his wife and children ? about $150 in a good month ? even though his economic lot has not improved radically . Still , his new career has its rewards . " My biggest satisfaction , " he says , " is a job well done . " In Brazil , they are called favelas ? home to 10 percent or more of the population in the major cities . Here , too , the government once tried to bulldoze the slums , but they have become as permanent a feature of Brazilian life as the crowds along the Copacabana . Although they are hotbeds of political activism ? stirred particularly by intellectuals and politicians who champion the cause of the slum dwellers ? the favelas are underdeveloped economically . Many squatters from rural areas seem to lack any expectation that they can attain a higher standard of living ? and thus the desire to work for it . Migrants who can submit to the discipline of urban employment may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little emphasis on enterprise , and as a result favelas produce relatively few of their own jobs . An exception is Vila Prudente , a densely populated favela in Sao Paulo that is home to 7,000 . Adjacent to highways and the polluted Tamanduatei River , it is not a pretty place to live ; nonetheless , it has come to be considered a " model " favela , thanks in part to the merchants ? from barbers to hardware peddlers ? who do business along its unpaved streets . One of them is Francisco Gomes de Sousa , 35 . In his 10 years in Vila Prudente he has turned a shack into a two-story grocery shop and home . He earns about $1,200 a month , enough to afford a car , a television set and refrigerator ; his prosperity has helped him become a leader of Vila Prudente 's Friends Association , a residents ' group that has fought for and won for the slum a number of services and favors from public officials .

Many are filled with people whose common goal is to superarse ? to better themselves . The goal may be closer in Venezuela than in many other countries of Latin America : the nation 's oil wealth ? and the government 's willingness to redistribute some of it ? make Venezuela 's slums relatively prosperous . That much is evident in San Jose , a neighborhood of the sprawling slum of Petare on the northeastern edge of Caracas . Most salaried workers in Venezuela get a year-end bonus of two months ' pay , and much of it is invested in hous- ing construction and improvement . At a time when the nation 's formal housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of whom do hold salaried jobs , are busy building " ranchos " ? literally ranches , but in reality shacks built from tin , cardboard or concrete . The Venezuelan government recently declared a " no more ranchos " policy in an effort to stem the sprawl of the slums . In San Jose , it is being politely ignored . Lump-sum severance pay for laid-off workers often provides slum residents with the capital to launch their own tiny businesses , sometimes repairing cars or operating taxis . Thousands of immigrants , mostly from the Caribbean basin , Ecuador or Colombia , thrive by driving cabs or operating small shops in the slums ' underground economy . More and more of the local entrepreneurs are women ; the slums have an increasing number of female-headed households . Father Marcel Rainville , an American priest who works in Las Minas de Baruta , a relatively well-off slum , says many inhabitants seem to have acquired a decided entrepreneurial bent .

More often than not , they end up in one of the ever-growing cinturones de miseria ? the " misery belts " that now ring the ancient Aztec capital . Dubbed **25;730;TOOLONG ? because they seem to have fallen from the sky , few of the newcomers can be said to land on their feet . Some end up begging ; others steal . Still others find their way to the Santa Fe dump . A sprawling former sand mine the size of 30 football fields , the dump is a wretched , squalid treasure trove . It is run by two powerful caciques , or bosses ? men with bodyguards and late-model cars who 've built their fortunes on garbage . They control an army of pepenadores , or scavengers , who live in shacks or small homes on the site , spending their days sifting the dump in order to recycle anything of value . The scavengers tote the proceeds ? semistale tortillas , wilted vegetables , bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a supervisor pays them by the kilo . The refuse is sorted and much of it then sold to any number of businesses : bone may be sent to a glue factory , old cans sent to be reshaped into construction rods or nails . Even a TV : Many pepenadores of Santa Fe have profited right along with their bosses . With their " wages " free from taxes or union dues , the more industrious scavengers can outearn a salaried construction worker . " Out of every 100 pepenadores , " says Mauro Flores Miranda , a supervisor at one dump site , " maybe 10 do n't have a TV . " Across town from Santa Fe is the squatters ' slum of Nezahualcoyotlnamed after a famous Aztec ruler , and Neza in local slang . Twenty-five years ago it was a dry lake bed ; now it is home to 3 million people and even boasts a soccer stadium that will host World Cup soccer games next year .

She has a small house in which she owns and operates a tiny grocery business that brings in about $3,000 in profits each year . But she still remembers her first days in Neza after she arrived from a small town near the Gulf of Mexico . She did what many a Latin slum dweller had done before her : she cast about for something to make and sell . So she bought lemons , mixed them with water , and made lemonade . @#
