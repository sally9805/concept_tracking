The Presidency <P> One of Peter 's less famous principles goes like this : " Speak when you 're angry - and you 'll make the best speech you 'll ever regret . " Well , not always . At the White House the political strategists calculate that Ronald Reagan could not have snapped " Shut up ! " at a better time . <P> First , Washington oldtimers can not remember such an ill-mannered assault on a President in the august East Room under the daunting gaze of George and Martha Washington . Second , Gary Richard Arnold , the congressional candidate from Santa Cruz , Calif , ( slogan : LOOKS LIKE LENIN , TALKS LIKE LINCOLN ) , who provoked Reagan , was the perfect person to spark the Irish flint , suspected but rarely revealed publicly , beneath then smiling , benign Reagan surface . <P> " Who was that ? " asked the President , once offstage following his campaign exhortation . White House Political Director Ed Rollins explained that the bearded Arnold was a candidate of extreme-right views . Reagan eyed Rollins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have known he was a kook . He was wearing a beard . " <P> At the least , Arnold , who is now talking about suing the Republican National Committee because it will not give him campaign money , is very unusual . For some time he has been calling the White House trying to get someone to listen to his views about the Trilateral Commission . No luck . <P> But Arnold knew where the cameras were . He was quiescent for the first two hours of a briefing for 60 Republican congressional candidates with the likes of White House Staffers Ed Meese , Jim Baker and David Stockman , but when the President stepped to the podium for the super pep talk , Arnold quickly rose to his feet while those around him tried unsuccessfully to wave him down , then pull him to his seat . <P> Arnold , beard quivering , bored in with a recital of disaster . " Mr. President , you have the us the largest tax increase in the U.S. history . . . the Soviets get the wheat situation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . . . and we have a Reagan-mortis setting in to the nation 's body politic . " <P> Bill McInturff , a young aide from the congressional campaign staff who was seated in the audience , was mortified . He leaped up to help the President by applauding , hoping that the others would join in and drown out Arnold . Alas , everybody , including Reagan , thought McInturff was endorsing Arnold . <P> Reagan who cool as his temperature rose . " O.K. , " he said , " I do n't know who the two the you are , but you have n't said a word that 's true yet . " Reagan gave the tax scripture according to Reagan . Arnold broke in again . " You have a small , elite rich - the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission - that totally runs your organization and your White House ! " he shouted . Reagan parried with humor . " I thought this was for Republican candidates . " Arnold bored on right through the laughter . " Just a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper by then had reached critical mass . <P> " Shut up ! " yelled Ronald Reagan , a shout shot round the world . The short , clear Reagan speech that followed outlining the Administration 's policy on China and Taiwan was among the best he has ever given . So much for Peter 's lesser principles .
