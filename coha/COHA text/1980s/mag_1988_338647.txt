In Manhattan a first-grader greets her visiting grandparents , happily exclaiming , " Come here , sientate ! " Her bemused grandfather , who does not speak Spanish , nevertheless knows she is asking him to sit down . A Miami personnel officer understands what a job applicant means when he says , " Quiero un part time . " Nor do drivers miss a beat reading a billboard alongside a Los Angeles street advertising CERVEZA  --  SIX-PACK ! <P> This free-form blend of Spanish and English , known as Spanglish , is common linguistic currency wherever concentrations of Hispanic Americans are found in the U.S. In Los Angeles , where 55% of the city 's 3 million inhabitants speak Spanish , Spanglish is as much a part of daily life as sunglasses . Unlike the broken-English efforts of earlier immigrants from Europe , Asia and other regions , Spanglish has become a widely accepted conversational mode used casually  --  even playfully  --  by Spanish-speaking immigrants and native-born Americans alike . <P> Consisting of one part Hispanicized English , one part Americanized Spanish and more than a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams comedy routine : a crackling line of cross-cultural patter straight from the melting pot . Often it enters Anglo homes and families through the children , who pick it up at school or at play with their young Hispanic contemporaries . In other cases , it comes from watching TV ; many an Anglo child watching Sesame Street has learned uno dos tres almost as quickly as one two three . <P> Spanglish takes a variety of forms , from the Southern California Anglos who bid farewell with the utterly silly " hasta la bye-bye " to the Cuban-American drivers in Miami who parquean their carros . Some Spanglish sentences are mostly Spanish , with a quick detour for an English word or two . A Latino friend may cut short a conversation by glancing at his watch and excusing himself with the explanation that he must " ir al supermarket . " <P> Many of the English words transplanted in this way are simply handier than their Spanish counterparts . No matter how distasteful the subject , for example , it is still easier to say " income tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , many Spanish-speaking immigrants have adopted such terms as VCR , microwave and dishwasher for what they view as largely American phenomena . Still other English words convey a cultural context that is not implicit in the Spanish . A friend who invites you to lonche most likely has in mind the brisk American custom of " doing lunch " rather than the languorous afternoon break traditionally implied by almuerzo . <P> Mainstream Americans exposed to similar hybrids of German , Chinese or Hindi might be mystified . But even Anglos who speak little or no Spanish are somewhat familiar with Spanglish . Living among them , for one thing , are 19 million Hispanics . In addition , more American high school and university students sign up for Spanish than for any other foreign language .
