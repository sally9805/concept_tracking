Boeing is enjoying a popularity among investors and analysts unlike any in recent memory . But it may be too much too soon , according to a handful of bears . Spurred by expectations of an impending influx of new commercial-aircraft orders and improved production efficiencies , a number of aerospace analysts recently have been falling over each other in the race to raise their earnings estimates . Only yesterday , Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. reportedly raised some of its estimates , while Judith Comeau , at Goldman Sachs , told clients " to stick with Boeing and maybe even add to positions " despite recent gains in the company ' s market value . Sanford C. Bernstein ' s David J. Smith , already regarded by some investors as " the raging bull of Boeing , " earlier lifted his earnings estimates , which include a whopping prediction of $24 a share for 1988 . In 1983 , the Seattle-based airline manufacturer earned $355 million , or $3. 67 a share , on sales of $11. 13 billion . To Boeing ' s credit , even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the world-wide airline market rebounds , Boeing will fly high . But as out of vogue as the sentiment is these days , a number of diehards insist the bulls are premature in forecasting a turnaround . " We think we are really at a trough when it comes to new orders , and don ' t see them rebounding to nearly the levels that people expect , " says Michael A. McNamara , associate director of research at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago . Adds Paine Webber ' s John V. Pincavage , who recently lowered his recommendation on Boeing from a buy to " neutral " : " People looking for big orders are going to be greatly disappointed . " Mr. McNamara , who says his firm made a killing on Boeing ' s stock from 1977 to 1983 , said the stock historically has moved in reaction to orders . But of late , he believes , Boeing ' s stock has been rising in anticipation of orders  --  a far riskier course . " There must be 25 rumors of Boeing orders to be announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already about a year old . However , he adds : " I ' ve had a hard time trying to independently confirm many of the rumors . " The most prevalent rumor currently making the rounds on Wall Street is that UAL Inc. , parent of United Airlines , is about to announce a $1. 5 billion order for roughly 30 Boeing 737-300s , with options for as many as 60 additional planes . Most analysts believe the rumor to be true , and say anticipation of that order alone has helped push Boeing ' s stock up several points . Boeing , which had traded as low as 15 in June 1982 , has climbed from a 1984 low of 35 5/8 last March to as high as 46 1/4 on Monday . On the New York Stock Exchange composite tape yesterday , it closed at 46 . United consistently has acknowledged that it is talking with both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas about a potentially sizable aircraft purchase . But a United spokesman says any purchase must be preceded by a favorable labor agreement with United ' s pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how many planes we may order ( and from whom ) are simply speculation . " Moreover , a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas yesterday maintained that " those analysts who believe Boeing has the ( United ) order wrapped up are probably not correct . " McDonnell Douglas is " still talking with United and we are absolutely not ruling ourselves out , " he added . Boeing declined to comment on the matter . While the Boeing optimists hold that world-wide aircraft orders will pick up as airline traffic grows and aging fleets require replacement , the pessimists see a different scenario on the horizon . They point to the prospects for a weakening economy in 1985-1986 ( and a concurrent decline in air travel ) , the inability of airlines to finance planes and a lack of pressure to acquire more fuel-efficient planes , due to soft petroleum prices . " My argument is if you order an airplane from Boeing today , you ' ll take delivery of it in the next recession , " says Paine Webber ' s Mr. Pincavage . Gary J. Reich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Western , Continental and Pan Am , which were buyers of planes during the last up cycle , probably can ' t be sizable buyers this time around . Even if sizable orders do materialize , there are some indications that Boeing may be forced to trim its profit margins to win them . " Boeing is hungry and it is making tremendous offers to anyone who will listen , " says an executive at one airline . " Terms are very , very nice . " Moreover , Boeing ' s most popular plane , the 737-300 , carries a price tag of only about $23 million . While some analysts believe the profit margins on the 737-300 are likely to be as good or better than those on Boeing ' s more expensive airplane models ( a 747-300 sells for about $100 million ) , they point out Boeing will have to sell a lot more 737-300s to generate the expected surge in profit . One bright spot that even the bears are hard-pressed to tarnish are reports that the " learning curve " on Boeing ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is improving at a more rapid pace than forecast . The " learning curve " represents the added efficiencies and cost savings that accrue to the company as it continues production of a new model . If , or when , Boeing does sell a lot of new planes , the better-than-expected learning curve could mean bigger profits on each plane.
