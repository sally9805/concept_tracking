Now , however , Boston is debating two of the largest projects ever planned for its downtown , and they represent a forthright attempt to make the city grow not by shoehorning but by expanding the borders of the business district . Yet in this case the projects , which would be adjacent and would be built on two piers , Fan Pier and Pier 4 , together constituting 30 acres of vacant land at the city ' s waterfront , would not ride roughshod over existing neighborhoods . They would expand downtown by letting it leap across a narrow channel , permitting the city to grow without trampling its existing communities in the process. // Both projects are significant architecturally , but it is hard not to speak first about the urban-planning issues they raise . Building on vacant land adjacent to a downtown is the closest thing Boston is ever going to get to a free lunch in this business - the only way it is possible to satisfy the marketplace ' s overwhelming desire for office space without crippling the city at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be similar to lower Manhattan ' s expansion onto the landfill of Battery Park City , New York ' s most successful mega-project by far . Indeed , it is the one such undertaking in New York City that is viewed as a positive , rather than a negative , urban development. // Fan Pier and Pier 4 together constitute Boston ' s chance for a Battery Park City , and in principle , that ' s all to the good . If the city ' s choice is between building on these 30 acres or trying to force more office towers into the already overbuilt financial district , tearing up existing neighborhoods , or letting the growth all go to the suburbs , there is no contest : this is where the growth belongs . Architecturally , though , the situation is more complex . One of the two projects , Fan Pier , is among the most ambitious that has been tried anywhere in the country ; it involves six of the nation ' s leading architects , each contributing one or more buildings , working under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Pier 4 project is more straightforward - there is but one architectural firm , Kallmann , McKinnell &; Wood . If it is a bit less ambitious , it is a bit more coherent. // The Pelli project first . Cesar Pelli , the New Haven-based architect who designed the office towers of Battery Park City , has proposed a complex that includes a 47-story hotel tower with a pyramidal top , four office towers , three apartment buildings , riverfront parks and promenades and a canal . Mr. Pelli himself would design the hotel tower and the two larger office towers ; Thomas Beeby of Hammond , Beeby &; Babka , who succeeded Mr. Pelli as dean of the Yale School of Architecture , would design one of the smaller office towers and Fred Koetter would design the other ; the apartment buildings would be by Robert Venturi , Frank Gehry and Robert A. M. Stern , and another , smaller building , which might contain a museum or cultural facility , has an architect yet to be named. // The overall site is a quarter circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The apartment towers and the hotel are set along the curve near the water , spread out from one another . The office buildings are farther inland , lined up close together like buildings along a street . A canal separates the office and residential areas. // Mr. Pelli describes the project , which is being developed by a partnership headed by Richard Friedman , a Boston developer , and the Pritzker family of Chicago , as seeking " diversity without cacophony . " It is a laudable goal , but is it attainable ? The apartment towers have only a limited sense of being part of an overall plan . On the other hand Mr. Pelli has tightened the reins on the designers of the office towers , including himself , requiring that these four buildings be so similar that one must struggle to see where the individual architects have left their mark. // Six of the best architects in the nation are at work here , and only Mr. Pelli seems to have been able to express himself comfortably . Mr. Gehry , Mr. Venturi and Mr. Stern have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seem to fight the overall mood of the place ; Mr. Beeby and Mr. Koetter toe the line , but at some cost to their own creative abilities . The ideas here are well intentioned , but the truth is that the balance between diversity and coherence is not as easy to attain as it seems . To tone down the three apartment buildings would be to deaden this project considerably ; to let everything become still more expressionistic would be to put in jeopardy what urban qualities this project does have. // For the Fan Pier project to work , it must look like an actual city , created over time , not like a make-believe place thrust up in an instant by a real-estate developer . The canal and the promenades that line it - oriented with a vista toward the Custom House Tower of 1907 , Boston ' s most cherished skyscraper - are a beginning , as is the round plaza in front of the hotel tower . But beyond the actual forms of the buildings , much will depend on the precise palette of materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all of masonry and brick and the specific choices of the type and color of the masonry will be important as a means of tying this project visually and conceptually to the rest of downtown Boston. // This project has already received conditional approval from the Boston Redevelopment Authority , as has its companion project , known as Pier 4 . Pier 4 is being undertaken by a partnership headed by the Boston restaurateur Anthony Athanas , who bought the waterfront land for both developments at rock-bottom prices back in the 1960 ' s , when it was considered nearly worthless by conventional real-estate investors . ( He has leased the Fan Pier to its developers and is putting together the Pier 4 project himself . ) Like the Fan Pier , Pier 4 wil be a mixed-use project . There will be a marina at the center , an office tower facing a large waterfront plaza , a hotel , and condominiums . Kallmann , McKinnell &; Wood ' s design is less striking than that planned for Fan Pier , but there are certain benefits to letting one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit tighter , a bit more ordered . It is too early to tell from the preliminary designs whether the handsome , stepped-back massing of the office tower will actually come off , or whether the waterfront plaza will be too big and windswept. // These questions , and the ones that have been raised about Fan Pier , are important . For while Boston is doing the right thing by looking to this waterfront area for its downtown growth , the mere fact of putting new buildings on this vacant land is not enough , and neither is hiring an all-star troupe of visiting architects . The potential for first-rate urban design is present in both of these projects , but only as the designs are refined will we know how good they will actually be. //
