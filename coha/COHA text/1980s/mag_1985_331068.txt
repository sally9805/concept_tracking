He had amassed 17 volumes of evidence , 79 exhibits , 17 videocassettes and 13 tape recordings . But after 22 days of testimony , State Prosecutor Leszek Pietrasinski was no closer to providing the answer to the question that troubles many Poles about the trial in the Torun courtroom : Who really ordered Father Jerzy Popieluszko 's death ? The trial entered its final days last week as Pietrasinski gave his summation in the trial of the four secret-police officers charged in the abduction and murder of Popieluszko . The bespectacled prosecutor unleashed an almost theatrical fury upon the confessed leader of the priest 's killers , former Secret Police Captain Grzegorz Piotrowski . Said Pietrasinski : " Piotrowski is a cold and ruthless murderer , a rascal who used the confidence of his subordinates for a hideous crime . " <P> Pietrasinski demanded that the ex-captain be put to death by hanging . It was the first time that any Communist state had publicly called for the execution of one of its secret policemen for a crime committed ostensibly in the line of duty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam 's apple working convulsively . <P> The prosecutor recommended that each of Piotrowski 's partners , Co-Defendants Waldemar Chmielewski and Leszek Pekala , receive a sentence of 25 years , the maximum term under Polish law . The men , he said , were following the orders of their superior . The prosecutor also recommended a sentence of 25 years for the fourth defendant , ex-Colonel Adam Pietruszka , who took no physical part in the crime but is accused of having encouraged Piotrowski in its commission . The prosecutor 's recommendations are expected to be approved by Presiding Judge Artur Kujawa and his four co-jurists this week . <P> Pietrasinski also made a scathing indictment of Popieluszko and the Roman Catholic Church . Said he : " Father Popieluszko was filled with hatred for socialist Poland . . . . They ( the defendants ) were extremists just as he ( Popieluszko ) was an extremist . Thus two extremist attitudes met . " Pietrasinski added with subtle cynicism that the aim of the four secret policemen was to discredit Poland 's Communist regime . Said he : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior Ministry as if to confirm that terror is being used in Poland . It is known that the kidnaping caused a great resonance . The defendants ' act carries all the traits of a political provocation . " <P> The comparison between the four defendants and the activist priest incensed auxiliary prosecutors who represent Popieluszko 's family and his driver , Waldemar Chrostowski . In his concluding remarks the following day , Edward Wende , the slain priest 's longtime attorney , who is representing Popieluszko 's brother and the driver , struck back . " I did not think , " he said , " that I would be forced to take the stand in the role of defender of the victim . Such a statement by the public prosecutor , which would equate the victim with the hangman without any reason for it , is probably unknown in any court records . " <P> Wende 's colleague , Lawyer Jan Olszewski , was equally dismayed at the prosecution 's failure to find the real instigator of the crime . In a veiled reference to the Soviet Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to release a spiral of mutual terror . Who could have had an interest in it ? Every child who studies history knows in whose interest Poland 's weakness is. "
