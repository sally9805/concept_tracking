Tramping softly through the sandy West Texas soil in her paisley skirt and black leather heels , Pearl Ceasar looks more like the first-grade teacher she used to be than the nun-turned-troublemaker she is . <P> Ceasar is the paid organizer for a church-based citizens group that is struggling to bring drinking water to thousands of impoverished families along the Mexican border . As such , she mobilizes working-class Hispanics who live in unregulated subdivisions called colonias that sprawl across miles of cotton fields in El Paso 's Lower Rio Grande Valley . <P> This September afternoon Sister is working the back roads of Socorro , a 17th century Spanish mission hamlet , mustering turnout for a meeting with an important politician . In the doorway of a cinder-block home , she embraces a key worker , Anastacia Ledesma , but wastes no time on niceties . " Cuantas personas ? Ciento , maybe ? " the nun asks in her novice Spanish , inquiring how ) many supporters the area can deliver to the meeting . " Doscientos , " comes the reply . " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four buses . This time we 'll fill four buses . " <P> For Ceasar , 45 , mobilizing the colonias is a lot like the teaching she did in Louisiana and Oklahoma as a Sister of Divine Providence . " We 're only giving people the tools to act  --  like learning to read , " she explains . " We 're teaching extraordinary things to ordinary people . " <P> But ten years ago , wanting " to make a difference , " she became an organizer with the Industrial Areas Foundation ( IAF ) , a community-action effort formed by master social organizer Saul Alinsky . A tough , tenacious workaholic , the nun has gained a sharper insight into the colonia dweller 's plight from her own roots : her Syrian grandparents encountered discrimination in rural Louisiana at the turn of the century . <P> Sister wants to pack Socorro 's La Purisima Church parish hall to the rafters to send a message to state officials that no one in the 350 ragtag subdivisions will rest until pipes are laid and water is flowing . Already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which she works , has made an imprint . Its nagging pressure since 1983 has snared endorsements , a formal commitment of water and a pledge for help in getting a delivery system of mains . But the Government has yet to produce one drop , or funds to dig a single trench , and for many , life 's basic necessity may still be years off . <P> The irony of hardworking blue-collar families drinking from contaminated wells or lugging five-gallon cans for miles to their kitchens is most galling , of course , to the have-nots themselves . " We keep hearing promises  --  water pretty soon , pretty soon , " laments Celia Mendoza , who homesteaded here with her husband and two young daughters four years ago . " But most of it has turned out to be a bunch of lies . "
