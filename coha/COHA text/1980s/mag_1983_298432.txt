At the center of the judges ' bench , hunched over his papers , sat the softspoken , bespectacled President of Israel 's Supreme Court . On his right was a scholarly fellow Justice who , with his impassioned manner and shock of black hair , cut the panel 's most arresting figure ; on his left , a trim , mustachioed , usually silent retired major general . The three members of the investigative commission-Yitzhak Kahan , 69 , Aharon Barak , 46 , and Yona Efrat , 56-are known respectively for integrity , independence and intrepidity . They are admired collectively for their dispassionate rectitude . No one had quarreled with their initial selection ; few quibbled about their final decision . <P> The team 's tone and agenda were set and its most searching questions asked by Kahan , a Justice of the Supreme Court since 1970 , celebrated for his scrupulous modesty . The natural choice to head the investigative commission , he demurred at first , citing two related cases he was involved in . Yet Kahan brought to the task powerful public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the law , noted for the clarity of his written opinions . Kahan is a withdrawn and deeply religious man : he attends synagogue regularly , eats only kosher food , and conscientiously observes the Sabbath . But in 1981 , when the Chief Rabbinate tried to stop an archaeological dig in Jerusalem on religious grounds , Kahan put science first and helped to give the project the green light . <P> As high strung as Kahan is low key , Barak ( whose name means lightning in Hebrew ) was the panel 's conscience , its most strident and at times indignant voice . An international authority on commercial law , Barak offers a dazzling resume . He was , at 32 , Israel 's youngest full professor , at 38 its youngest Attorney General , and at 42 one of its youngest Supreme Court Justices . He is also , as the Jerusalem Post puts it , " a pillar of probity , " a respected champion of individual rights , indifferent to rank and impervious to reputation . As Attorney General , in 1977 he sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of Israel and in 1977 forced the Minister of Finance to withdraw a plan to give amnesty to tax evaders . In April 1977 he prosecuted Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 's wife Leah for holding U.S. bank accounts , forcing Rabin 's departure from office . And as Begin 's legal adviser , Barak was , wrote Jimmy Carter in his memoirs , " a real hero in the Camp David discussions . " <P> Efrat , now an energy-industry executive , was the panel 's quiet member . But when he spoke it was as a man personally acquainted with both military habit and Ariel Sharon . In Israel 's war of independence , he broke out of the hospital a week after being shot in the neck , in order to rejoin his platoon ; during the 1967 war he commanded the audacious Golani Brigade , which seized seemingly unassailable Syrian positions . Since then , he has proved similarly dauntless in inquiries into episodes of possible army misconduct . As a former aide to Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan , Efrat also hesitated before joining the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
