Invoking old values , Ronald Reagan must make them work in the ' 80s <P> On an afternoon in early December , Los Angeles was in the 60s and Ronald Reagan looked like a dream . He was wearing a blue-and-green wool tartan jacket , a purple tie , white shirt , white handkerchief , black pants and black loafers with gold along the tops . Who else could dress that way ? He settled back on a couch in a living room so splurged with color that even the black seemed exuberant . A florist must have decorated it . A florist must have decorated his voice . He was talking about job hunting as a kid in his home town of Dixon , Ill. , telling an American success story he has told a hundred times before . He seemed genuinely happy to hear it again . No noise made its way up to the house on Pacific Palisades , except for the occasional yip of a dog , and , of course , the eternal sound of California-the whir of a well-tuned car . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid , Spanish names . Reagan 's face was ruddy , in bloom , growing younger by the second . <P> At week 's end he would be expected at the convocation of conservatives for the National Review 's 25th anniversary dinner in the Plaza Hotel in New York City . Reagan would not show -a mix-up in his calendar . Riled , his hosts would sing his praises over dessert nonetheless . He was the answer to their prayers , after all ; the essential reason for the elegant , confident glow of the evening . Editor William F. Buckley Jr . would shine quietly , modestly .

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizens for Goldwater , he gave his " A Time for Choosing " television speech , a speech so tough that Goldwater himself was skittish about letting it air . Reagan ended the talk with " You and I have a rendezvous with destiny , " and was at least half right . So mesmerizing was his performance , so quick in its effect , that California businessmen swamped him like groupies , formed a " Friends of Ronald Reagan " committee , begged him to run for Governor . He had to be pushed . Yet in 1966 the former star of Juke Girl snatched the governorship of California by a million votes from incumbent Edmund G. ( " Pat " ) Brown , who must have thought he was the victim of an accident . ( Reagan also starred in Accidents Will Happen . ) <P> In fact , there has been a remarkably accidental air about Reagan 's career ; it has always borne the quality of something he could take or leave . The image of the non-politician running for office , antilogical as it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic . Because Reagan knows who he is , he knows what he wants . After a halfhearted run at Nixon for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968 , he returned to California for a second term as Governor . But in 1976 , after an all-out and failed attempt to capture his party 's nomination , he genuinely did not wish to be Gerald Ford 's Vice President . When Ford 's
