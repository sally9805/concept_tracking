The way Jones won the eighth annual America ' s Marathon - with a ferocious kick in which he averaged 4 : 45 per mile for the last seven miles - was significant too . That ' s track-running time ; in fact his 29 : 38 clocking for the final 10 , 000 meters would have been a world record at that distance in the 1940s . To run so fast after putting in 20 miles is a truly phenomenal feat - indeed there had never before been a comparable finish in a marathon. // Jones ' s victory and the manner in which he achieved it thus emphatically underscored a growing trend in which runners with track and cross-country backgrounds are taking over the longer races - even the 26-mile , 385-yard marathon . It also added to the impressive string of marathon successes by British runners this year , including Geoff Smith ' s victory in Boston , Charlie Spedding ' s win at London and bronze medal in the Olympics , and Irishman John Treacy ' s silver at Los Angeles . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come only recently to the marathon after spending most of their time competing at much shorter distances. // ' ' I really do think it ' s because basically we ' re all track runners , ' ' Jones said when asked for his explanation of the recent British successes . ' ' We train for the track , and our speed threshold is higher than that of marathoners . A top marathoner can run sub-five-minute miles for 20 miles and be able to keep on around that pace ; we can do it and then pick it up. // ' ' The thing people wonder about track runners is whether the endurance is going to be there - but as you can see , it is . Our mileage in training may not be as high as that of a marathoner , but we have 10 years or so background in running , and all those miles over all those years have built up our endurance too. ' ' // Jones feels , in fact , that one reason Salazar ' s recent marathon efforts have not matched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began training too much like a marathoner. // ' ' I think you ' ll find that his fastest and best marathons came not that long after he set the US record in the 10 , 000 , ' ' he said . ' ' In the last two years , though , he concentrated on miles and neglected track work . I think this year you ' ll see him go back to track work. ' ' // Jones , a corporal in the Royal Air Force , grew up in Ebbn Vale , South Wales , and initially got into running at age 15 through an Air Training Corps youth program . He had never done any formal training , but one day some friends were going to a cross-country race for ATC cadets and talked him into coming along - and of course , in the usual storybook fashion , he did better than any of them . These cadet meets four times a year were his only running experiences for the next few years , but by the time he joined the RAF at age 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career. // ' ' It was something I had had some success at , and you know how youngsters revel in success , ' ' he says . ' ' I wanted to take it as far as I could. ' ' // Jones certainly wasn ' t any ' ' overnight success ' ' at that time . He learned right away that it was a lot different running against people who had been in regular training than it had been against cadets coming out to meets four times a year the way he was . But ' ' you quickly adapt , ' ' he says - and eventually he started making a name for himself in running circles. // The first breakthrough came via a seventh place in the 1976 Welsh national cross-country championships - despite which he was bypassed in the selection of 13 runners for the national team. // ' ' I guess maybe they thought I was a flash in the pan , ' ' he said in an interview during a recent stop in Boston to compete in a benefit race in nearby Braintree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just said to myself , ' Next time they ' ll have to pick me . ' I set a goal right then to win the race the next year - and I did . In fact I ' ve won it every year since then except one. ' ' // Of course Wales is a small country , so this in itself doesn ' t mean too much , but by 1980 Jones had moved up enough to be a strong contender for the British Olympic team . He went for it in the steeplechase but finished fourth , beaten for the third and last spot by just a few seconds. // ' ' It was tough , ' ' he says , ' ' but I didn ' t spend much time thinking about it . You can ' t sit around and be disappointed . There ' s so much more to achieve. ' ' // Over the next few years Steve had some good international races , topped by a third in the world cross-country championships last March . He also made the 1984 British Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish a very respectable eighth in Los Angeles. // As for the marathon , Jones had never even run one when he accepted an invitation to the 1983 America ' s Marathon in Chicago - primarily , he says , because it meant a nice expenses-paid trip to the United States for himself , his wife , Annette , and their two young boys. // And why did the organizers want a track runner who had no ' ' name ' ' value ? // ' ' I think I had built a reputation for giving a full effort , for making it a race , ' ' he says . ' ' I ' m not the kind of guy to hide in the pack . I don ' t mess around . I think they said , ' If Jonesy is in the race it ' ll be a good one - whether he wins it or not. ' ' // Unfortunately , Jones injured his ankle the day before the event . He tried to run anyway , but had to drop out at 16 miles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back this year - which turned out to be a pretty smart move on their part ! // And what ' s ahead now for Steve ? // ' ' I ' ll run in Chicago next year , ' ' he said , ' ' and I ' m thinking of doing one other marathon in the spring . There are the European and world cross-country championships too , and I also want to continue my track career. // And is he looking as far ahead as 1988 and the next Olympics ? // ' ' Everyone else seems to be , so I might as well , ' ' he said with a smile . ' ' Originally I thought about the 10 , 000 again . Now I ' m thinking marathon too . But I will pick one - I won ' t try to do both. ' ' // Finally , what about the chances of breaking his own world record ? // ' ' I think I can run faster , ' ' he said . ' ' I ' m not saying how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the right conditions I could break it - and so could a number of other people . All 10 , 000-meter runners , I might add !
