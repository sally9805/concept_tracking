MR . NICE GUY . Later this year West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will launch a program to refurbish U.S. military bases and improve community relations with American troops in the Federal Republic . Why is Kohl playing Mr. Nice Guy ? Bonn sources say he is concerned that shabby barracks and lack of contact with German civilians can turn G.I.s into ambassadors of ill will when they return home . He also hopes to head off any " German bashing " by Bush over Bonn 's contributions to its own defense .
