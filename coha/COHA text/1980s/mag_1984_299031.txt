" To say that the news of the Soviet withdrawal from the Summer Olympics deflated our Los Angeles staff would be a considerable understatement , " says Bureau Chief Benjamin Gate . " Like the athletes training to compete for the medals , we have been preparing our coverage for more than a year : beats were assigned , sources developed and operational plans drawn . " Gate heard the unhappy announcement on cable TV last Tuesday morning while he was at home downing a glass of Instant Breakfast . As he made ready to redeploy the bureau 's staff , TIME correspondents and stringers around the world were also responding , including those in Washington , Colorado Springs , Geneva and Eastern Europe . At the heart of the controversy , Moscow Bureau Chief Erik Amfitheatrof was surprised to find the issue being down-played to the point of invisibility . Notes he : " A story that was Page One everywhere else was on the last page of Pravda . " In California , where the story was very big news , Correspondent Steven Holmes , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organizing Committee for ten months , canvassed its headquarters seeking reactions from committee members and President Peter Ueberroth . Joseph Kane handled the security implications , William Blaylock the effect on Olympic sponsors and licensees , and Russell Leavitt the repercussions for commercial television . Correspondent Melissa Ludtke talked to Olympic contestants and heard in their voices " both an empathy with the Soviet athletes and an exasperation that U.S. performers had once again been robbed of the opportunity to test themselves against the best in Olympic competition . " <P> Ludtke is a recent migrant to the West Coast from New York City , where she reported for TIME on subjects as diverse as babies , heart disease and the forged Hitler diaries . Her involvement with sports has been lifelong . She rowed competitively for Wellesley ( as did her grandmother from 1903 to 1907 ) , was a reporter for 4 years at SPORTS ILLUSTRATED , and while at TIME held down second base for the magazine 's Softball team . In Los Angeles , she finds " the ease and proximity of doing sports remarkable . Facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the intention can be turned into action in seconds . " <P> Ludtke , Holmes and Gate , all onetime New Yorkers , got together for a head-clearing jog one morning last week . Said Gate of the short surcease from the trials of a late-starting cover story : " It produced a different kind of sweat , but it felt great . "
