Hints of other planets <P> Peering out across the broad , lonely wastes of space , scientists have long wondered if there were intelligent beings on other worlds . Now two astronomers have found strong evidence that planets like earth and its eight celestial cousins in the sun 's solar system may be common in the Milky Way . In a new , highly detailed photograph of Beta Pictoris , a neighborly 293 trillion miles from the sun , Bradford Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson and Richard Terrile of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , have discovered that the star is encircled by a dim disc of gas and solid particles . The astronomers believe that those particles may be the signs of newborn planets and worlds in formation . The spectacular image is the first visual evidence of another solar system , raising the possibility that extraterrestrial life may some day be found . " The time will have to come when we realize that we 're not the center of the universe , " says Terrile . " The galaxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civilizations . " <P> The finding was not entirely unexpected . A team of scientists at the Jet Propulsion Lab that analyzed emanations of heat from the orbiting infrared astronomy telescope ( IRAS ) announced last spring that four nearby stars appeared to be surrounded by some kind of matter . At the Cerro Las Campanas Observatory in central Chile , Smith and Terrile trained a 100-in. telescope on one of those stars , Beta Pictoris , which was then visible high in the sky . Taking a photograph , however , turned out to be extremely difficult . Beta is twice as bright as the sun , and its light easily overwhelms that from any faint material around it . Trying to discern the surrounding matter , says Terrile , was " like trying to see a match next to a flashbulb . " <P> The two scientists finally employed an instrument called a coronagraph , which can block out the most blinding light of a star , making a kind of eclipse . With Beta in shadow , Terrile and Smith then attached a special detector to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The resulting image of an encircling disc looked remarkably similar to our own solar system . Analyzing the configuration of the disc with a computer , they found that some matter may have condensed to form planets . <P> Terrile and Smith point out that if a Beta planetary system does exist , it is an unlikely place to find galactic citizens : the distant network is only about 100 million years old , in contrast with the 4.5 billion years of earth . The most primitive form of life did not appear on earth until 1 billion years later . Some astronomers , moreover , are skeptical of the pair 's planetary speculation . Says Fred Gillett of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories in Tucson and a member of the IRAS team : " It would be impossible , using this technique , to detect large bodies .
