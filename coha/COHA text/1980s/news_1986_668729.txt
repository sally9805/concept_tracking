Only my closest friends know . Coworkers , I ' m afraid , suspect . Now , with the publication of this week ' s cover story by Maxine Levy , I ' ve decided to come out of the closet about my secret food vice . I ' m a fast-food junkie . It ' s hard for a food editor to admit an addiction to McDonald ' s french fries and McDLT , or Taco Bell ' s taco salad . At lunch I sneak out of the office and across the street for a fix of french fries . On weekend shopping trips I " rest " in the nearest fast-food restaurant . Even the appearance of the new Fast-Food Eating Guide hasn ' t dampened my enthusiasm for Big Macs and Whoppers . Published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a consumer activist group in Washington , D.C. , whose members undoubtedly eat sprouts and tofu , the eating guide is a large poster that gives us more than we really want to know about fast-food contents . Calories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 items as well as entire meals . To add to the misery , the guide gives a " gloom " rating for foods . The more healthful a food , the lower the gloom : A baked potato has a gloom rating of 1 . A Wendy ' s baked potato with bacon and cheese is 41 . An entire meal , double cheeseburger , cola , fries and a Frosty dessert , is 89 . The poster suggests that we not consume more than 50-75 gloom points in an entire day . For fast-food junkies , it ' s all too gloomy to think about . But those willing to find out what they ' ve been eating all these years can order a Fast Food Eating Guide by sending name , address and a check for $3. 95 ( or $7. 95 for the laminated version ) to Center for Science in the Public Interest , 1501 16th St. N.W. , Washington , D.C. 20036.  --   --   --  Other weighty matters : International Pickle Week has been stretched to two weeks , May 14-28 .
