From Cairo and Khartoum west to the Atlantic coast of Morocco , North African leaders acknowledge that population growth , food shortages , and religious zeal add up to a far greater challenge than the revolutionary subversion of Libya ' s Muammar Qaddafi . The latest sign of instability is this week ' s bloodless coup in Mauritania , a country particularly hard-hit by drought and encroaching desert. // ' ' You see , ' ' Sudan ' s President Jaafar Nimeiry recently told a Western visitor , ' ' we have chosen an Islamic society . But even Islam isn ' t enough . To survive , we need rain , water , and good land to grow food , much more food ! ' ' // President Nimeiry explained that Sudan ' s national energies are now directed toward winning new farmland instead of projected resumption of oil drilling in southern Sudan , suspended after last year ' s attacks by secessionists opposing northern Sudan ' s Muslim law . ( Ironically , many of the secessionists are Christians or other non-Muslims supported by Colonel Qaddafi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain new agricultural areas by draining southern Sudan ' s vast Sudd marshes . Some experts are urging this project on him . Others feel it contains the seeds of ecological disaster by upsetting natural balances between southern Sudan ' s plants , animals , and humans . But the President is determined to go ahead when capital becomes available. // In Egypt , President Hosni Mubarak , like the late Anwar Sadat before him , has steered away from conflict with Israel to face the huge task of feeding an exploding population . Muslim fundamentalists - long a key feature of Sudan ' s political life - have begun to pose a real threat to Mr. Mubarak ' s middle-of-the-road style of government. // Since Nov. 22 , Cairo ' s 1 , 000-year-old Islamic university of Al-Azhar , the oldest and most prestigious institution of its kind in the Arab world , has been disturbed by student demonstrations . Mr. Mubarak reluctantly closed the university . Student demonstrators had moved from protesting the death of a demonstrator during demands for better student food and allowances to making major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and enforced conservative dress for women students. // Egypt ' s oldest and most prestigious fundamentalist group , the Muslim Brotherhood , now is challenging the legality of a government ban imposed on them 30 years ago by Egypt ' s first revolutionary president , Gamal Abdel Nasser , after the brotherhood tried to kill him. // Such fundamentalist Islamic groups as Jihad ( Holy War ) , which claimed responsibility for Mr. Sadat ' s murder in October 1981 , the Soldiers of Allah , and Renunciation and Flight operate on Egypt ' s university campuses and in professional life . They question the secular habits and values of a society where a large Christian minority coexisted mostly peacefully with the Muslim majority - until Lebanon ' s sectarian strife in 1975 and Iran ' s Shia Muslim revolution in 1979 both helped trigger surges of fundamentalism elsewhere. // In Libya , Colonel Qaddafi is supposed by some outside critics to have enforced harsh Islamic laws . However , recent visits to Libya indicate that Qaddafi ' s supporters , many of them poorly educated younger people in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the revolutionary committees that supervise the committees and terrorize Qaddafi ' s Libyan opponents abroad , are little concerned with religion. // Some Islamic scholars and leaders of mosque prayers have run afoul of the committees for being too conservative in interpreting doctrine , or in urging mercy for Qaddafi ' s enemies who have been hanged at home ( especially after the unsuccessful attack on his headquarters outside Tripoli last May 8 ) , or gunned down in distant cities like London , Paris , Rome , or Athens. // After the recent failed plot in Cairo to kill former Libyan Prime Minister Abdel Hamid Bakkush - exposed by Egyptian security men who faked the murder by two Britons and two Maltese allegedly on the Libyan payroll - Qaddafi ' s supporters have tried to explain it away. // The London Sunday Times reported from Valletta , Malta , that Libyan agents there tried to convince a reporter that failure of the plot was deliberately planned without Qaddafi ' s knowledge by a revolutionary committee to prove to Qaddafi that Bakkush and Mubarak are irredeemable ' ' traitors. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events that he publicly blamed on Libya : mining of the Red Sea last summer ; planned attacks to damage the Aswan High Dam and so disrupt Egypt ' s vital and precarious agriculture and to block the Suez Canal to shipping ; and the offer of a $4 billion Libyan bribe to Mr. Mubarak if he would renounce the Camp David peace accords with Israel , end his dependence on US aid , and join the radical Arab camp. // After military precautions suggested that Mr. Mubarak was preparing for war with Qaddafi , Egyptian media stopped gloating over the Bakkush affair to concentrate on the nation ' s staggering economic and food problems , as well as Mideast politics. // In Tunisia , supporters of North Africa ' s longest-governing chief of state , President Habib Bourguiba , are wondering whether Tunisia faces another winter of mass protest . Last January , many people were killed and wounded in outbreaks touched off by a sudden rise in staple food prices . Many Muslim fundamentalists were jailed . Colonel Qaddafi ' s supporters also , as usual , drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Parliament recently went to the unusual length of passing a law which could deprive Muhammad Masmoudi , a Tunisian-born former foreign minister , of his Tunisian citizenship . Mr. Masmoudi has long supported Qaddafi ' s attempts at union with Tunisia and other Arab countries . Qaddafi has appointed him as Libya ' s ambassador to the United Nations in New York. // The small North African republic now faces possible new unrest fanned by unemployment , growing numbers of young school dropouts , drought in the south , and uneven rainfall in Tunisia ' s northern farming districts. // Prime Minister Muhammad M ' zali , President Bourguiba ' s constitutional successor , has been trying to placate the illegal Islamic Tendency Movement . The movement challenges the entire secular basis of the society Mr. Bourguiba built after Tunisia gained independence from France in 1956 . However , Mr. M ' zali apparently feels the need of allies against militant labor unions. // Last Nov. 1 , neighboring Algeria celebrated the 30th anniversary of the start of its successful eight-year war for independence from France . Hundreds of invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Chadli Bendjedid , reelected with support of the Algerian Army and the ruling National Liberation Front to a second presidential term last January. // The relentless advance of the Sahara and food shortages have begun to affect some parts of southern Algeria , though with nothing like the impact they have on such neighbors as Mali , Chad , or Mauritania . But Algeria ' s leaders appear more relaxed than Egyptian , Sudanese , or Tunisian ones about Muslim fundamentalism as a possible threat . Student disturbances were dealt with fairly severely in 1980-83 and have since subsided. // In private , Algerians are bitter over Qaddafi ' s claims to southern Algerian oil fields and alleged subsidization of former President Ahmed Ben Bella , now an adversary of the Algiers government , who heads a London-based Islamic Revolutionary Council . But they are far more concerned about the Moroccan-Libyan pact signed by Qaddafi and Morocco ' s King Hassan II last August. // Several factors may have forced King Hassan to seek the connection with Qaddafi . Last year , Morocco had major trouble over unemployment , hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also vast expenditures for Morocco ' s 10-year-old war against the Polisario Front ( now formally admitted to the Organization of African Unity as the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic , precipitating Morocco ' s exit from the OAU last month ) , an unprecedented drought in Morocco ' s grain-growing areas , and spreading poverty were major factors. // From Qaddafi , Hassan has now obtained a halt to Libyan aid to the Polisario , the offer of cheap oil and many jobs for Moroccans in Libya . In return , Hassan made what Qaddafi ' s Libyan foes call the shameful gesture of handing over to Qaddafi several Libyan dissidents who had lived in Morocco. // Though not friendly toward Qaddafi , King Fahd of Saudi Arabia gave the union his discreet blessing . Qaddafi in return gave King Fahd , a close ally of Hassan , an extraordinary public apology during Libya ' s recent 15th revolutionary anniversary celebrations. // He spoke of the ' ' misguided ' ' zealotry of Libyan pilgrims during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca , who planned to seize Saudi mosques and holy places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saudi authorities. // Qaddafi ' s rapprochement with Morocco added to French President Francois Mitterrand ' s recent embarrassment over Qaddafi ' s apparently broken word in failing to pull Libyan troops out of Chad after French troops left . The pullout was scheduled under a September Franco-Libyan agreement in which Hassan seems to have played a mediating role. // Drought and economic adversity , many North Africans believe , will help to speed the day when Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and perhaps a post-Qaddafi Libya are able to unite in a single entity called the Greater Maghreb . Algeria and Tunisia signed one of a number of inter-North African unity pacts in March 1983 . Mauritania joined them in December 1983. // King Hassan then laid the groundwork for his pact with Qaddafi by promising not to send troops to support the anti-Qaddafi French-backed regime of Hissein Habre in Chad , if Qaddafi would confirm his withdrawal of support for the Polisario Front in Western Sahara . Qaddafi was pleased to respond positively . Apparently unperceived by the US Embassy in Rabat , the ' ' union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Africa observers seriously question the official US and French optimism that Qaddafi ' s new Moroccan connection will influence him toward more cautious policies . The US Congress recently voted $50 million to refurbish Morocco ' s Sidi Slimane air base to beef up the long-range strength of the US Rapid Deployment Force . But Morocco is now a country committed , at least on paper , to fight on Qaddafi ' s side if he is attacked or otherwise comes into conflict with any outsider , including the US. // At the other end of North Africa , Egypt has been assured since the early ' 70s of protection against Soviet military aid to Libya in any conflict . This is an important reason why North African power games could involve the superpowers. // John Cooley , a correspondent for ABC News in London , is a writer on North African affairs and former Mideast correspondent of the Monitor. // //
