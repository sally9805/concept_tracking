* At first glance , the black-and-white poster at Peking University hardly looked like a call for revolutionary change . Yet under the heading A DIRECTORY OF FAMOUS CHINESE , the broadside traced with devastating clarity the network of family ties that links China 's top leaders and perpetuates their power . That farflung network , along with the rampant corruption that Chinese citizens are forced to endure each day , has gone far to galvanize the outcry for democracy in China 's streets . <P> The nepotism starts with Deng Xiaoping , whose eldest son , Deng Pufang , 44 , heads the giant China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped . Government investigators say Pufang , who was crippled when Red Guards threw him from a window during the Cultural Revolution , allegedly helped a Chinese conglomerate gain tax-exempt status and reap vast profits for fraudulent work . Pufang denies the charges . The names of other relatives of leaders read like entries in a Chinese Who 's Who . Among them : Chi Haotian , 59 , Chief of Staff of the People 's Liberation Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 53 , a rising Politburo member whose father was Li Weihan , a founder of the Communist Party ; and State Councilor Zou Jiahua , 62 , son-in-law of a famed army marshal . <P> Even when they do not hold high office , the relatives of China 's elite enjoy lives of privilege . Known as the taizi pai , or the princes ' faction , they attend the best schools , get the best jobs , live in luxury apartments and drive Mercedes-Benz to shop in special stores . Such advantages naturally gall the less favored . " Why him and not me ? " asks a party official who was recently leapfrogged by a young taizi pai colleague . " You ponder the question , and the answer is nepotism . " <P> Fairness also has little to do with the system of guandao , or official profiteering , that permeates Chinese society . On a small scale , leaders at all levels routinely use their positions to obtain free restaurant meals or theater tickets . In a grander manner , officials buy scarce raw materials such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the open market for handsome profits . <P> When three top party officials visited a hospitalized hunger striker , the angry student declared , " If you really wish to re-establish the Communist Party 's prestige , you must first excise the official profiteers . " Many Chinese courts have been trying to do just that . The judicial system handled 37,000 cases of profiteering last year , up 50% from 1987 . More than 100 embezzlers and bribe takers were sentenced to death or life imprisonment . <P> Though Premier Li Peng appeared to have triumphed over General Secretary Zhao Ziyang last week , both men are accused of string pulling . One source of resentment against Li , the adopted son of former Premier Zhou Enlai , is that his connections enabled him to study in Moscow and rise rapidly through the ranks . Zhao 's son is chairman of the Hainan Huahai Co. , a trading and investment company . Moreover , Yang , Zhao and Deng are all believed to have sons-in-law who work for army-run companies that export Chinese arms .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
