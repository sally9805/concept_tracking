Ten years ago , when I was researching my book Kind &; Usual Punishment : The Prison Business , there was a spate of litigation for prisoners ' rights . In those days , the courts seemed to be at least one avenue of redress . At its height , in the early 1970s , the " prison movement " ( as it was known ) attracted the pro bono ' services of lawyers around the country ; the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund devoted much energy to this cause . For the first time in the dismal history of prisons , these lawyers succeeded in breaking through the intransigence of prison administrators and the reluctance of courts to look behind prison walls . Important victories were won in the area of due process for prisoners ; some of these were eventually wiped out by the Supreme Court , some still stand . But on the whole , despite these efforts , from the point of ViCW Ur 1:11C 111411 1.71- W0111411 ill 1.11G plistni t-cii , lily has , if anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison scene then and now , I consulted William B. Turner , for some years the Northern California counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , in which capacity he represented scores of prisoners . " You are right in thinking that there is no ' prison movement ' anymore , " he said . He has come to the disheartening conclusion that a principal outcome of judicial decisions in favor of prisoner-litigants is " a vast increase in the bureaucratization of the prison , so that it now behaves much more like other unresponsive government bureaucracies . Prison officials are now engulfed in paper work , helping them to ' build a record ' and defend themselves in lawsuits brought by convicts . But one can question whether anything of substance has changed . " Michael Satris , directing attorney of the Prison Law Office at San Quentin , spends his full time on prison litigation . As he describes it , it 's like running on a treadmill to stay in place : " It seems to the that whereas in the old days litigation was being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of the litigation now is aimed at simply preserving the status quo . " Both he and Bill Turner pointed to drastic overcrowding as the overriding horror now endured by California inJessica Mitford is the author of A Fine Old Conflict and Poison Penmanship ( both Alfred A. Knopf ) . This article was adapted from a recent speech at the California State Bar 's annual dinner of California women lawyers . mates . " The point is , " said Turner , " that the crowding undermines the modest reforms obtained in the early seventies by swamping the system 's ability to deliver basic services , like medical care and personal safety . Who cares if you can send an uncensored letter to your mom if you have to ask your 300-pound cellmate for permission to turn on the light to write it ? " Judicial redress in this area seems unlikely since the Supreme Court has ruled that overcrowding per se is not cruel and unusual punishment  --  although in a dissenting opinion Justice Thurgood Marshall pointed out that double-celled inmates are confined year after year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 24 square feet , about the size of a typical door . " ( He was describing , by the way , a brand-new prison in Lucasville , Ohio  --  one that I saw under construction in 1971 . It was to be a dream prison : a whimsical decorator had painted the cells in soft pastel shades of baby blue , rose pink , light green . It is today filled to 38 percent over capacity . ) It is sentencing policies , at least in California , which have led to today 's crisis . A review of California 's recent history is instructive for other states as well . In the early 1970s , the chief programmatic and legislative goal of the prison movement was the abolition of the inll i ll ilw was aim " Lily 1114111 all U31. uf book . The indeterminate sentence was originally conceived of as a reform measure in which the authorities looked not at the crime but at the perpetrator , whose performance in prison would be judged by a parole board and whose time to be served set accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the range was enormous : for burglary , depending on degree , it extended from less than one year to life ; for assault with a deadly weapon , from five years to life . It was a form of excruciating psychological torture for the prisoners , who never knew from one year to the next if they would be paroled . Under the supposedly humane indeterminate sentence , time served in California rose to the highest in the nation . In the mid-1970s prisoner-support groups , after round-the-clock meetings with concerned liberals in the state legislature , finally succeeded in toppling the hated indeterminate sentence . It was a moment of optimism . The reform seemed fruitful , as far as it went . The ridiculous rhetoric about " rehabilitation " as a goal of prison , which had long been just a sour joke , was replaced by the frank acknowledgment that prison is punishment . The injustice of indeterminacy , in which discretion as to time served was in effect handed over to the prison authorities  --  a parole date could be indefinitely postponed if a prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty of definite sentences . The new determinate sentences permitted little judicial discretion . For example , burglary would carry a three-year sentence that the judge could modify to two years for a first offender or four years for a multiple offender . While nobody was happy about the length of these sentences , the statute itself was hailed as a victory for more evenhanded justice , based as it was on an agreement between legislators and advocates of prisoners ' rights . This statute was soon undermined by Jerry Brown 's capitulation to primal screams from prosecutors , police and the right wing of the legislature . According to Jim Smith , a lawyer who participated in the agreement , Governor Brown was " very deferential to the law-and-order crowd . Longer prison terms were decreed before the ink was dry on the original bill . It 's grown to insane proportions  --  our agreement was turned on its head . For example , in 1976 there were only about seventy prisoners sentenced to ' life without possibility of parole . ' Today , there are well over a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They know crime ca n't be solved by long prison sentences . They caved in to political pressure . " And Mike Snedeker , another participant : " None of the legislators had an ounce of backbone . I 'm amazed at Governor Brown  --  today there are thousands more serving long , long terms in state prison . His policies have proved to befar more repressive than Reagan 's when he was governor . It 's ironic that Governor Brown and the legislature are now taking the heat for being soft on crime . They 're in a neck-andneck race with their right-wing opponents , trying to prove their toughness . " In this area , it seems , Big is Beautiful ; in his senatorial campaign , Jerry Brown actually brags that he has doubled the rate of state prison commitments during his two terms . In Bill Turner 's view , Brown 's pronouncements on crime and criminal justice are " the worst aspects of his tenure in office  --  while , paradoxically , his judicial appointments have been excellent . " It is against this background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest ) panacea being offered in California , as in many other states : namely , more money for more prisons . Last June the voters in California approved Proposition 1 , a measure to provide $495 million for prison construction . ( The figure reminds me of those bargain-basement prices : " Only $4.95 , " which is supposed to sound cheaper than $5 ? or in this case half a billion dollars . ) What will those millions buy ? In the early 1970s I discovered , through an examination of the California Department of Corrections budget , that it cost as much to keep a man in San Quentin for a year as it would to send him to Harvard , then about $5,000 . By 1982 the cost of both had risen drastically , but the equation remains surprisingly constant : today , it 's roughly $13,000 for a year in San Quentin or at Harvard . Take your choice . ( My proposal for exchange scholarships between these venerable institutions has thus far fallen on deaf ears . ) Earlier this year Samuel L. Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered an eloquent address entitled " California Prisons : A New Approach is Needed , " in which he gave a rationale for more prisons . He cited horrendous figures . In one year , 1980 to 1981 , the number of people imprisoned in the United States rose by 12.1 percent . In the same year , the number imprisoned in California rose by 19 percent . Over the past ten years , 234 California inmates and staff have died in prison homicides . He pulled out all the stops in describing the hideous consequences of massive overcrowding : the dangerously substandard medical care , the rats , cockroaches and vermin in the cell blocks and kitchens , the virtual abandonment of any pretense of supplying vocational and educational programs . " In short , " he said , " prison is an existence spent in suspension , squalor and fear . " He called for the legislature to reconsider long prison sentences , for " a fundamental re-evaluation of our penal practices and growing reliance on prisons as a response to criminal conduct " and for " immediate formation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where have I read all this before ? It is paraphrased in every Presidential crime commission report , in every well-intentioned liberal 's treatise on the evil of prison . But the punch line in all of these is : " We need more money for more prisons . " Thus Samuel Williams : " I supported Proposition 1 because I believe that the current state of our prisons is a disgrace . " The State Bar Board of Governors unanimously went along with this curious reasoning , endorsing Proposition 1 , decrying prison conditions and saying that " a massive infusion of dollars is needed . " A dissenting voice was heard ( but only after the endorsement ) from the Standing Committee on Legal Services for Prisoners  --  perhaps the only official group within the State Bar with day-to-day experience in the prison world . The committee wrote with restrained fury about its " dissatisfaction with the premature vote on this question . . . . We were surprised at the obviously rushed approval process which bypassed other interested sections and committees of the State Bar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pointed out that " building more institutions may simply mean incarcerating an even greater share of the population . . . . All of the evidence makes it appear that new prisons will in fact not relieve overcrowding and will not create more humane conditions for prisoners . " It cited a report , prepared for the Justice Department by ABT Associates in Boston , " which gathered data on every new prison opened in the U.S between 1955 and 1976 . . . . Nevin prisons generally reached rated capacity by only the second year after opening . " It concluded with the recommendation that the Board of Governors reconsider its endorsement and adopt a resolution " opposing the facile solution that new prison construction is an adequate solution to overcrowding . " The board did not . The question of what can be done to prevent crime has been debated not just for decades but for centuries . This brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon in which two cavemen are discussing how to prevent pregnancy . " But how can we prevent it , since we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . It has become a hoary axiom , repeated since prisons were invented a couple hundred years ago , that " prisons are a failure , they do n't improve people , they are schools for crime . " It is a dictum that has been said with depressing regularity by at least the last five Presidents of the United States and their attorneys general . Thus Samuel Williams writes , " Prisons are a breeding ground for crime . " Yet , says he in the next breath , " I supported Prop &ition; 1 because I believe that the current state of our prisons is a disgrace . " What about The New Yorker 's cavemen , who do n't want any further breeding  --  let alone a special " breeding ground " ? I visualize one saying to the other , " Hey ! How about those new fertility pills people are talking about ? " The other answers , " Those do n't prevent pregnancy , you dummy , they increase it . " " So what ? " ' says the first caveman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're up-to-date on the problem . " Perhaps it was in the spirit of these well-intentioned troglodytes that in this election year politicians around thecountry , like the California State Bar governors , are advocating bigger ? if not better  --  prisons . ?
