Champignon and all , Mitterrand is wowed by the U.S. <P> Behind his back , some of his entourage called him " the candidate . " There was the somber and fastidious President of France , barnstorming across the U.S. last week like a practiced old pol . He rapped about jazz in the South , cradled a squealing suckling pig in the Midwest , shook hands with demonstrators in the West , and pressed Legion of Honor medals on every mayor he met . He barely speaks a word of English , but it hardly mattered . When Franois Mitterrand gushed , " J'aime le peuple Americain , " everybody got the message . <P> As soon as his official visit with President Reagan was over , Mitterrand borrowed Air Force One and took off on a five-day , seven-city tour of all things American , from high-tech microchips from Silicon Valley to a down-home barbecue in Illinois . <P> Mitterrand flew first to Atlanta to place a wreath on the grave of Martin Luther King Jr . and meet with his widow . He charmed Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep South as a youth , Louis Armstrong 's version of Georgia on My Mind kept running through his head . <P> On reaching San Francisco , Mitterrand stole a few hours for an impromptu walk downtown with his wife Danielle . Disconcerted Secret Service escorts balefully followed the French couple up and down steep Chinatown streets , and were almost as shocked as the waiters when Mitterrand dropped into Scott 's Seafood Grill for a late-night snack . Ceremony was restored by Mayor Dianne Feinstein , who feted Mitterrand at a city hall gala . He smiled stoically as an Army brass band oompahed its way through La Marseillaise , then beamed when Violinist Isaac Stern took the podium . <P> In nearby Berkeley , Mitterrand 's French press corps reveled in the parade of West Coast characters : gay rights activists heckling Governor George Deukmejian , Hare Krishnas chanting in their saffron robes , all-purpose cranks going about their lonely protests . Declared one placard : ALL POLITICIANS , OF LEFT OR RIGHT , ARE PIGS . Every passing flake drew an appreciative " Oh , j'adore ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitterrand wallowed in American technological know-how , inspecting a solar-powered village in Davis before sitting down with high-powered Silicon Valley executives at Stanford University . The French President was rapt when Whiz-Kid Steven Jobs , co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. , explained how venture capital and small companies helped trigger the Silicon Valley boom . <P> The tone for the Midwest stop was set en route from the West Coast . As champagne was being poured in the galley , the French contingent 's well-meaning but far-from-fluent American stewardess announced that " champignon " would soon be served . Her passengers whooped with ungallant laughter . In Gaylesburg , Ill. , to tour Secretary of Agriculture John Block 's 3,000-acre farm , Mitterrand donned rubber boots , a farmer 's cap and a sky-blue jacket with MR . PRESIDENT stitched over the heart . He and Block disagreed about American exports undercutting European Community farmers , but Mitterrand lightened the mood by driving a tractor and cuddling a piglet with black-and-white markings . Said he : " Our pigs tend to be bigger and pink . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
