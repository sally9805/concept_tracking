Theodore Choplick , assistant vice principal at Piscataway High School in New Jersey , thought he was doing a reasonable thing . He opened the purse of a 14- year-old girl who had been caught breaking school rules by smoking in the lavatory . The girl denied she had been smoking in the lavatory or that she ever smoked . Choplick figured that the contents of her purse would show whether she was lying . They did . The purse contained cigarettes , marijuana and some notes suggesting that she was selling pot to other students . Choplick called the police . <P> Last week , after three lower court proceedings and nearly five years , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that Choplick had indeed been " reasonable . " In so doing , the court held in law what many principals and teachers have held in practice : public school is a special place wherein the usual guarantees and restrictions of the Fourth Amendment regarding search and seizure of an individual or his property do not necessarily apply . The amendment specifies that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that authorities can obtain a search warrant only for " probable cause " that something illegal will be found . But , wrote Justice Byron White for the majority , any public school student can be searched by school officials without a warrant and upon nothing more than " reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school . " <P> At Piscataway High , Principal James Koch , proud of the " tight ship " he runs , said that the decision " puts an element of safety and stability back into public schools , " without which " no education can take place . " At other schools around the country , the judgment brought more applause and , in some states , outright relief . According to Scott Thomson , executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals , teachers and administrators , uneasy about their rights of search , " have been looking the other way " when they sensed that something wrong was afoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases from Alaska to Georgia involving school searches , lower court decisions have been sending what Thomson calls " a mixed message . " A Louisiana court ruled for the stricter standard of probable cause ; a few other states have cast school officials in loco parentis ( in the place of a parent ) , able to search pretty much at will . But most lower courts have presaged the Supreme Court ruling for reasonable grounds , allowing the kind of search Choplick made . <P> In declaring reasonable grounds as the minimum standard , Justice White noted that school personnel are not surrogate parents but state officials , who must respect the pupils ' general right to protection under the Fourth Amendment . Nevertheless , wrote White , " school disorder has often taken particularly ugly forms : drug use and violent crime . . . have become major social problems . " Thus a " proper educational environment requires close supervision of schoolchildren , " along with " a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures . " The key , White declared , is to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some privacy and the school 's need to keep order .
