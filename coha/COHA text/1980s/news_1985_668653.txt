Mayor Harold Washington ' s proposal for a $150 million bond issue to rehabilitate deteriorating neighborhoods was stalled in the city council Finance Committee on Wednesday by an outburst of excessive enthusiasm among the aldermen rather than the usual bickering . Aldermen from both factions of city government caught committee leaders by surprise with a flurry of pork barrel amendments for new construction projects in nearly all 50 wards . The amendments raised the bond issue price tag to more than $204 million and prompted warnings by Frank Raines , the Washington administration ' s financial adviser , that it was questionable whether banks would take a risk on such a huge issue . Raines additionally warned the aldermen on the politically sensitive issue of property taxes . If the new pork barrel projects are adopted , taxes would rise $7. 55 on a $60 , 000 home by 1988 , he said . Under the mayor ' s improvement plan the additional tax would be $3. 90 . Ald. Roman Pucinski ( 41st ) bristled at the label of " pork barrel " from the media in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , ' pork barrel ' ? " Pucinski asked . " This is not a pork barrel or giveaway program . In my ward I have 270 blocks of WPA streets built in the Depression , and the people in my ward are going to have to pay their share in the repairs . " Street repairs are going to cost a homeowner with a 30-foot lot $510 . . . in addition to an increase in their taxes , " Pucinski explained . For sidewalk repairs , the city and homeowners split the cost , city officials said . After nearly four hours of testimony , Ald. Edward Burke ( 14th ) , Finance Committee chairman , abruptly recessed the hearings to allow Public Works and Budget Department staffs to assess the new amendments . Burke , a majority bloc leader , with assistance from the Washington administration , is expected to take a cleaver to the amendments before another Finance Committee meeting Thursday morning . Leaders of both factions hope to get the final package approved by the committee Thursday in order to submit it to a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Wednesday ' s meeting , Burke and other committee leaders had expected to approve an increase in the mayor ' s initial proposal to about $170 million . But they were caught by surprise by the deluge of amendments for pet projects . " The wish list got a little bit larger than one would expect and hopefully will be pared back , " Burke said . Burke and Sharon Gist Gilliam , city budget director , defended the aldermen against the " pork barrel " charges . " I do not concur with the media that an alderman who is providing for the needs of his ward is pork barreling , " Gilliam said in putting the aldermen at ease briefly . She and Burke said that many of the projects are vital but that aldermen should seek other programs or sources of funding . An estimated 80 percent of the new projects proposed Wednesday , by dollar amount , were earmarked for wards represented by the 29-member council majority bloc . Washington had proposed $125 million in projects with another $25 million to cover issuance costs . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in projects was added , boosting the combined package plus costs to about $204 million , according to Raines . Raines explained to the aldermen that the city could face difficulty in obtaining letters of credit from banks for a bond issue that large over a 25- year period . He said he could foresee no problem with financing of the mayor ' s proposal and perhaps getting banking support for a $170 million issue contemplated by Burke . Burke conceded that getting banking support could be a problem but added , " The Mitsubishi Bank or any other international banking concern used in the past , in my opinion , would have no problem in issuing letters of credit up to $170 million . " Gilliam insisted that Raines ' $204 million estimate could be conservative and in joking with reporters said , " If they keep this up , this will rival the ' Build Illinois ' program . " Gilliam said a cursory inspection of the amendments appeared to indicate duplication in proposed projects and some improvements that could be financed from other sources . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sidewalk repairs were Pucinski ' s 41st , with a request for $9 million , and Ald. Gerald McLaughlin ' s 45th , seeking $6 million . During the hearings , Paul Karas , acting public works director , was asked how long it would take to make needed street repairs if the council does not take action on the bond issue . " About ( the year ) 2040 , " Karas replied . In his initial appeal for $150 million in general obligation bonds , to procure $125 million for actual use , Washington said almost 80 percent of the $125 million would go directly to the repair of streets , sidewalks , alleys and sewers . There would be no tax increases as a result in 1985 and less than $4 in 1987 and 1988 . Among the highlights of the original proposal were provisions for four miles of street resurfacing in each of the 50 wards , 450 blocks of sidewalk repairs , 10 major sewer projects , 65 blocks of new alleys , 50 , 000 new street and alley lights , $8 million for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new streets where country roads exist , primarily on the Northwest and Southwest Sides . The Washington administration and Burke agree that it is imperative the city move ahead on the bond issue to take advantage of favorable interest rates . The council recently agreed to refinance bonds sold in 1982 at high interest rates that will result in a slight decrease in property taxes to be paid next year . CAPTION : PHOTO : Ald.
