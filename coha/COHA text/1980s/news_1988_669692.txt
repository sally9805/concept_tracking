' ' It ' s as if we were being forced into anti-Americanism , ' ' says Asad Abdul-Rahman , an official of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , of which Mr. Arafat is chairman. // ' ' Anyone who really wanted moderation would encourage moderation , but , instead , moderates are being penalized , ' ' Dr. Abdul-Rahman adds. // Arafat will bear that lesson in mind in formulating his next moves , Arab sources say . Rather than make fresh concessions to an unresponsive US , these sources say , Arafat is likely to pursue a lower-profile , longer-term strategy to chip away at remaining doubts about his willingness and capacity to hold the PLO on a moderate course. // // ' ' If the PLO keeps to its strategy and shows it is serious about giving peace a chance , that ' s the only hope to build up pressure on the US and Israel , ' ' a Palestinian journalist says. // Arafat delivered the latest in a series of conciliatory statements on Tuesday . In an address to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited Israel to come to Geneva to negotiate a solution to the Middle East conflict . Israel quickly rejected the offer , calling it a ' ' monumental act of deception. ' ' // And the US State Department said that Arafat ' ' continued to be ambiguous , ' ' since he failed to meet three US demands . The US insists that the PLO recognize Israel , renounce terrorism , and accept without qualification UN Resolutions 242 and 338 ( which call for Israel ' s withdrawal from occupied lands and the right of all states in the region to exist in peace ) , as the basis of future peace talks. // Arab and even many Western officials voice exasperation over the unwillingness of the US to meet Arafat halfway. // ' ' The American position is not defensible in political terms , ' ' says a Western diplomatic source in Amman. // ' ' The Americans are telling the PLO to recognize Israel , while Israel is saying that no concessions will make a difference , ' ' the diplomat says . ' ' The lesson for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ' s missing in the American position is a promise that if Arafat delivers , the US will respond. ' ' // Over the past six months the PLO , buttressed by the year-long Palestinian uprising , has taken steps to meet the US conditions by agreeing conditionally to 242 , backing negotiations , and extending de facto recognition to Israel . Asking the PLO to go further , while placing few such demands on Israel , is to hold the PLO to a double standard , Arab sources say. // ' ' They want us to make a total political strip tease and stand naked even without asking Israel to take off its overcoat , ' ' Abdul-Rahman complains. // By refusing to meet Arafat halfway , the US has also weakened his position vis-a-vis PLO extremists , who will remind the PLO chairman that his moderation did not pay off , other Arab sources say . Even moderate Arab governments are unlikely to advise further concessions. // Arab sources say that Arafat has already gone too far toward recognizing Israel for many in the PLO , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed , unable to spearhead changes in the PLO ' s position , these sources say . That places the ball squarely in the court of incoming US President George Bush , who will now have to find some way to move the peace process off dead center , these sources , including senior Jordanian officials , say. // At the same time , Arab officials and analysts point to several gains scored by Arafat as a result of a PLO ' ' peace offensive ' ' launched last summer. // First , a senior Jordanian official notes , ' ' Arafat is providing ammunition for those in the middle , for those who are looking for an excuse to give the PLO the benefit of the doubt. ' ' // Second , Arafat has successfully conveyed the impression that it is the PLO that is now taking the initiative for peace. // ' ' Each time Arafat goes a yard it looks like a mile , because of the intransigence of the US and Israel , ' ' another Jordanian official comments. // Finally , the guerrilla leader has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear on the Middle East peace process. // One is the Jewish community in the US . A tiny crack in the wall of resistance to dealing with the PLO appeared last week when five prominent US Jews met with Arafat in Stockholm . The five expressed optimism after the guerrilla leader , through a Swedish official , proclaimed his acceptance of Israel by name in a four-point statement. // The other is Europe , where Arafat ' s recent peace gestures have been warmly received. // ' ' There ' s a certain tide in favor of the PLO in Europe , ' ' comments a Western diplomat in Amman . ' ' It ' s not strong , but the outlook is changing . It means that European governments will have more flexibility in being stringent with Israel. ' ' // One example of the kind of pressure Europe could bring to bear on Israel was seen earlier this year . The European Community used the threat of withholding trade privileges to force Israel to allow Palestinian farmers to market their products in Europe directly , rather than through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two considerations will likely make the PLO withhold further concessions until there is some promise of reciprocity. // One is the PLO ' s own bargaining leverage . ' ' It ' s not like Arafat has no cards to play , ' ' the Palestinian journalist says . ' ' With the intifadah going on , Israel is paying a price. ' ' // More important are pervasive concerns within the PLO that even if further concessions are made , the US , under the influence of the pro-Israel lobby , would find other ways to avoid a dialogue. // PLO sources ask why Arafat should take the biggest gamble of his career and risk deep splits within the organization , if further concessions will also be dismissed. // The leader of a pro-Syrian PLO faction recently criticized Arafat ' s Stockholm statement recognizing Israel as ' ' capitulatory . ' ' That echoes the internal opposition that three years ago fractured the guerrilla movement over Arafat ' s acceptance of a joint PLO-Jordan peace plan. // //             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
