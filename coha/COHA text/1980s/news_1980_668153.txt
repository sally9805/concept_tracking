Interim MBTA chief Barry M. Locke said yesterday that recent austerity efforts have reduced overtime and absenteeism for the first nine months of this year to the lowest levels in four years . Locke said overtime has dropped dramatically in the past four months and that statistics reported earlier this week , showing near-record overtime levels , covered only the first six months of the year . In a prepared statement , Locke said that in the first nine months of this year the MBTA has spent 17 percent less on overtime than in the comparable period last year , and that this year ' s overtime spending is 34 percent below 1978 levels . Locke stressed , in a telephone interview , that disciplinary actions against MBTA employees have risen sharply , from about 9000 hours of suspensions for the first nine months of the last three years to more than 15,000 hours so far this year . He said this was resulting in improved service to the public , and cited as an example the increased reliability of bus operations . The transit authority missed only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with the 8.5 percent missed in September of last year . " In the past everyone has considered this a place to retire to , " Locke said , " but we ' re a big business and we will function as a business , with the bottom line being reasonable cost for reliable service . " James E. Smith , staff director of the MBTA Advisory Board , agreed that bus service has improved , and said that T operations director Andrew C. Hyde " deserves a lot of credit for that . " But he said problems with overtime spending at the transit authority have not been resolved . " If everything is so good , Locke should be saving money rather than spending more and more , " Smith said . " There is continuing overtime abuse at the T. " Smith charged that , while total overtime is down , senior employees are still collecting huge quantities of it , " fattening their pensions , so the T has to retire them at $30,000 a year for life . " He said this " will negatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Locke acknowledged " there is a problem " that may prevent management from eliminating seniority rules that now allow longtime employees to collect large amounts of overtime . He said pending legal challenges to arbitration laws passed in 1978 could defeat management efforts to change the seniority rules . He said " we are trying to find a way out " of the legal tangle , but said he could not promise that a solution will be found before current contract talks with the Boston Carmen ' s Union go to arbitration next month . If challenges to the 1978 laws are not resolved by then , arbitrators will be governed by pre- 1978 statutes . Most observers agree that if the contract is arbitrated under pre- 1978 laws , management ' s chances of winning major revisions in the seniority system are scant . Responding to Smith ' s statement that costs should not be escalating so swiftly if overtime and absenteeism are being reduced significantly , Locke said the increased spending is required because the transit system has been expanding steadily and maintenance of vehicles and facilities is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the price of the paper still goes up , " he stressed . " I think that parallel is important . "
