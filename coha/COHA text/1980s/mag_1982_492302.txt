PATTI DAVIS : DOING IT HER WAY Patti Davis jokes that there 's always been something wrong with her . Not physically , of course ; she 's a vegetarian of eight years and seldom suffers a sniffle . No , it 's her appearance that bothers her . " Something is always kind of askew with me , you know ? " she laughs . " I look at my mother , and she 's so well put together , even when she does n't try . I remember growing up thinking that everything seems to fall right on her . Me ? There 's usually a button off my skirt , a spot on my shirt or my hair 's a mess . I can lay out my clothes the night before and something still will be wrong . It 's inevitable . " Catching up with Patti on a cool , smogless day in southern California amounts to merely following your ear . Her address leads to a shady residential street in Santa Monica and culminates at a blank wall : a tall privacy fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment , the tinny clatter of typewriter keys , first on a rampage , then dropping back for a correction or two , is the only sound coming from behind the stockadelike barrier . On the other side of the fence is a row of snug , bungalow apartments , identical enough to baffle Agatha Christie 's Miss Marple . One belongs to Patti , but with doors opened wide to the ocean breeze , tracking apartment numbers is impossible . " Patti ? " " Here I am , " answers the typist behind screen door number two . " C'm on in . " She jerks the paper from the machine on her dining room table , studies it carefully and passes judgment . " I ca n't believe I got through college like this . I 've actually misspelled my name . I 'll have to white it out . " The object of her displeasure is her resume , a do-it-yourself project that is slightly dog-eared from additions , corrections and generous coats of fix-it fluid . But why would anyone with the name of Reagan need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she explains with a how-could-you-evenask expression . " My resume 's more like a list of credits . A short list . Of course , some people include details like height , weight and hair color . I do n't do that because I figure , if I send a picture , it 's obvious the hair is brown , the eyes are brown . . . . " And the face is remarkably pretty . Dressed in blousy white shorts and a bright turquoise camp shirt , Patricia Ann Reagan  --  or Patti Davis , as she prefers  --  is tall , slim , tanned and shoeless . Barely 30 , she 's everybody 's notion of how a California girl should look . Everybody 's notion , that is , except her own . " Sometimes when I go out on auditions and readings , I watch these totally together girls come in . Everything looks right ; everything matches . Well , nothing ever matches on me . If it blends , I 'm happy . " With her Secret Service detail in tow , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesslike setting of a director 's office , she played the part of a girl attacked by a stranger who lunges out at her from the shadows . Her instructions were to get involved in the role , to shout for help and fight off the nonexistent assailant in the nonexistent shadows . It was n't easy ; but the tough part came later when Patti , back to being Patti again , returned to her apartment to await the casting director 's verdict . Unfortunately , rejection is as much a part of show business as success , and even a girl often described by the media as sensitive and shy has to learn to cope with it . " Sure it stings , and I hope it always will , " says Patti . " If I ever get to the point of being so callousand hardened that rejection does n't bother me , I do n't think I 'd be a very good actress or a very worthwhile person anymore . You have to have sensitivity to be an artist , but you also have to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a fighter by nature  --  a survivor . Instead of rejection beating me down , it makes me say , ' Okay , I know what I did wrong ; now on to the next thing . ' " This ability to be tough and sensitive at the same time is typically Patti . Her personality , full of opposites , happily defies labels . She admits to being an introverted showoff , shy but outspoken and serious about laughing at herself . Like her mother , who once described herself as a " nester , " Patti has the knack of turning living quarters into a snug retreat . Here , too , her multifaceted personality bubbles to the top . The thoroughly modern Patti surrounds herself with comfortably worn antiques and a hodgepodge of collectibles that somehow blend together . Old-fashioned lace curtains hang in every window , banks of potted plants decorate the corners , a menagerie of miniature crystal animals stands on end tables , and Victorian lamps provide soft lighting through marbleized petal shades . More surprises : Her fireplace , inoperable anyway , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , and a Fibber McGee closet in the living room is simply filled . It is here , in her tiny three-room apartment , where she prepares for her next audition and occasionally bites her nails awaiting a decision on her last . If she 's learned to deal with rejection , she 's also mastered the euphoria that accompanies the news , " You got the part . " Her on-camera credits may not require a multipage resume , but the number recently swelled to double figures . She earned glowing reviews for her role in the NBC movie For Ladies Only , and she 's appeared in such weekly offerings as " Hart to Hart , " " Vegas , " " Love Boat , " " Fantasy Island , " " Nero Wolfe " and " Midnight Special . " Such semisteady assignments have given her a reprieve from the waitress jobs that supported her acting habit for several years . She 's waited on tables in two stretches , quitting the first time after a song she cowrote was recorded by The Eagles . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was hired as a hostess at a Mexican restaurant in the canyon . Most people admire this fierce determination to maintain her financial independence . " The customers I served did n't think it was so great , " she recalls . " I was one of the worst waitresses you 'll ever hope to meet . I forgot everything . When I go into restaurants today , I leave a very large tip because my heart goes out to them . In my acting class , a new student came in the other night , looked at me and said , ' I know you from somewhere . ' I recognized him , too ; I used to wait on him . I was so worried that he might remember me , I moved to the other side of the room . " If her days of taking orders for tacos and Margaritas are behind her , so are her nights of carrying in a guitar , setting up a sound system and performing original songs for patrons at The Improvisation , The Icehouse , Troubador , McCabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling her time . A feature role as a French newscaster in Blake Edwards ' The Curse of the Pink Panther sent her scurrying to a dialect coach to brush up on her schoolgirl French . The result , which wo n't be seen until next summer , is her best performance yet . She still writes pop rock in bursts of creativity that generally strike in the morning , and , yes , she recently splurged on an electric guitar . But acting will always take priority . This career goal was set years ago , when the Reagans lived just down the beach a sprint or two in Pacific Palisades . In those prepolitics days , Patti amused herself by teasing her hair into Julie Christie boiiffants and fantasizing about waltzing with Yul Erynner . " I was a ham from the word go , " she claims . " My parents have home movies of me with curtains draped over my head like a Madonna . I love big skirts like they wore in Westerns , so I 'd get curtains and bedspreads and layer them until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The King and I was my favorite record ; I memorized it and went around singing excerpts and doing skits . When my brother Ron was old enough , I recruited him into my little productions . " With the talented likes of godfather William Holden and family pals Jimmy Cagney and Dick Powell dropping in to talk shop with her parents , she acquired a healthy grasp of entertainment as a profession . " That whole environment helped put show business into perspective for me . Aspects that might be seductive to some people  --  the hype , publicity and excesses  --  do n't hold any mystery for me . The actors I was around were in the business because of their craft and their art . To me , those were the stars : the Dick Powells , Robert Taylors and Jimmy Stewarts . " If the roots of her occupation wind back to those early days , so does her dedication to her favorite preoccupation : total fitness . She 's a vocal proponent of a sugar-free , meatless diet and an advocate of a vigorous exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Hardly the product of a jellybean childhood , she finds the media 's fascination with her dad 's candy preference difficult to swallow . " That 's all been blown out of proportion , " she says . " I 've actually read that my father eats handfuls for breakfast . It 's not true . I mean , he likes jellybeans and might eat a few occasionally , but it 's certainly not an everyday , three-times-a-day type of thing . " Because she was never exposed to candy , soft drinks and other processed foods at home , Patti had little tolerance for such treats when she went off to an Arizona boarding school as a teen-ager . Duly enrolled and feeling very independent , she promptly went on a sugary binge and just as promptly began to suffer serious consequences . " I had never been allowed to eat candy at home , so when I started stuffing myself , I gained a lot of weight . Then I began taking diet pills and going on crazy diets to lose it . I abused my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy . My heart rate was terrible , my potassium level was low , and the doctor called me in and told me I was in bad shape . That scared me into doing something . I gradually became interested in nutrition , vitamins , herbs and alternative healing methods . At first it was just a way to make myself healthy again . But the more I got into it , the more I wanted to know . " After purging her diet of obvious offenders  --  white bread , sugar , excess salt  --  she stopped eating meat and limited her intake of dairy products . Fresh fruits , vegetables , whole grains and soybean products became her mainstays . " I never liked meat very well as a little girl because it made me feel sluggish and full . I wanted to jump up from the dinner table and get out on my skateboard , but I could n't do that if I had eaten meat , " she explains . " I 'm not totally opposed to chicken if it comes from a health food store and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals and given steroids to plump it up . I eat a little fish , but not much shellfish . Other than that , I 'm not picky . " An acting career , complete with weeks on location in unfamiliar surroundings , could cause a less imaginative health-food advocate to succumb to sedentary days , fast-food lunches and dinners at beefand-chop chains . Not Patti . She packs her brewer 's yeast , millet and chlorella ( a sea algae rich in vitamins , chlorophyll and protein ) in her luggage and then picks and chooses carefully from the local menu . " I think you can find something to eat anywhere , " she says . " I could go to a steakhouse and have a baked potato and salad and be perfectly satisfied . As far as exercise goes , the first thing I do on the road is find a place to work out . I call around and get a schedule . If I 'm doing a film , I look up the stuntman because he usually exercises every day . That 's what I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went jogging together . Of course , I have exercise tapes I take with me when I travel , but as disciplined as I am , it 's still hard to work out by myself . " Total fitness , at least the variety Patti aspires to , encompasses vibrant mental health as well as physical well-being . She champions the value of a positive outlook and is determined to send negativity the way of T-bones and Twinkies . With this in mind , she admits there 's work in progress on her personality . She 's trying to be less intense and // more laid back these days . In short , she 's mellowing . The feisty teenager , who once announced she would n't conform and that she 'd walk around in army fatigues if it suited her , has acquiesced . " When did I say that ? It must have been a long time ago when conform ' was a big word in my vocabulary , " she says . " I do n't use it anymore because I do n't think you can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mellowed . Definitely . I 'm not as strident or rebellious as I was . I 'm trying to slow myself down a bit . Whenever I get in trouble , it 's from not taking my time ; so I 'm trying to take my time now . " If there was a period of estrangement between Patti and her parents , it has long since been mended . The Reagans are very much in evidence in their daughter 's apartment , although they are physically a continent away . The bright green dustjacket of Nancy 's autobiography is obvious in the bookcase in the living room , and an old movie still of the President is given a place of honor on the piano in the bedroom . A baby picture of Nancy and a portrait of Nancy 's parents , Dr. and Mrs. Loyal Davis , round out the family gallery . Although the Washington social scene still may not be Patti 's choice for an evening out , she fits in nicely when the occasion arises . Much of the media , still bent on portraying her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inauguration in a Dior original as a major concession . Patti , who prefers jeans or sweatsuits , saw it merely as a necessity that goes with the territory of being a presidential offspring . No more , no less . " Hopefully , as we get older , things like that take on less importance , and we recognize the things that really matter in life , " she says seriously . Then she lapses into her habit of poking fun at herself . " I did n't have very much success walking in that dress . I think I ripped it in about three places . As I remember , I had masking tape on the hem by the end of the evening . I sort of walk like a baseball player . Not exactly grace in motion . " Graceful or not , she 's a good sport . She 's dutifully made the rounds of the bacon-and-egg shows ? " Today , " " Good Morning America " ? and answered all of Jane Pauley 's and David Hartman 's questions about being related to Ronald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stalled Chatty Cathy did she call a halt . No more interviews . " I do n't want to talk anymore about being the President 's daughter , " she says flatly . " In a way , that sounds unrealistic because that 's what I am . But I 'm also an actress , a songwriter and an artist in my own right . Of course , until I really make my mark on a larger scale , I ca n't expect to escape the label . I 'm not intolerant of people recognizing me for that first . It happens . That 's just where the situation is right now . " But situations are subject to change , and Patti 's been working and waiting for a positive change in her career for a long time . If success comes by association , she wo n't turn it down at this point . Remember , she 's mellowing . " By the time of my father 's election , I had grown up a little bit . " I was tired . If some publicity , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to argue with it . I work really hard at my craft , and you ca n't turn down any bit of focus that 's given you . " Now squarely in the center of the spotlight , she 's uncertain of the image she projects . And in Hollywood , image is everything . Is she still viewed as a rebellious maverick ? An interesting holdover from the **26;4329;TOOLONG generation ? Or a self-proclaimed klutz ? " grace in motion , " as she says . " Somebody will have to tell me , I guess , because I do n't know , " she admits . " I hope the image I 'm projecting is that I 'm honest , strong and sincere in what I say , what I work for and what I speak out on . I hope that comes across . " It does , and eventually those attributes may take top billing , replacing her currently ballyhooed connection with the White House . She 'll be Patti Davis : actress , singer , musician , writer , artist , nutritionist and , oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan will be invited to sit across the sofa from David Hartman and tell what it 's like to be Patti Davis ' dad .
