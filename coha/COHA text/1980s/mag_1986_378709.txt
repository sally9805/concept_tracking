When they reach the age of 75 , even the most resilient of men and women are tempted to settle back and reflect on the past with a mixture of pride and wistfulness . Ronald Reagan does not have that luxury or , in fact , that temperament . As he rings in the sixth year of his presidency at the Palm Springs estate of Publisher Walter Annenberg this week and looks forward to his 75th birthday a month later , he faces a year that may be critical for his principal goals : scaling back the role of Government and improving the prospects for peace and security . <P> The Administration , along with a Congress preoccupied with November elections , will face challenges that in some ways are more difficult ( and certainly more gnarled with complexities ) than when Reagan launched his bold programs in 1981 . The crisis-prone budget process has been burdened with an unpredictable new element that seems certain to create still more crises . The President 's plan to reform and simplify the tax code was passed ( just barely ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned the simplicity , then tossed it to the Senate . Reagan 's long-standing desire to speak directly to the Soviet people will be realized on New Year 's Day , when he and Party Leader Mikhail Gorbachev give reciprocal radio and television addresses to each other 's nations ; but when they sit down for their second summit later in the year , a world yearning for progress on arms control will be looking for more than hopeful words and handshakes . All in all , predicts New York 's Democratic Senator Daniel Moynihan , 1986 is shaping up as " crisis-ridden and tumultuous . " <P> Most difficult of all will be navigating the murky waters of the Gramm-Rudman Act , the jerry-built scheme adopted last month that mandates automatic reductions in federal spending if necessary to reach specific deficit-cutting targets . The tumult caused by this unprecedented measure , whose constitutionality is under challenge , will begin almost immediately . On Jan. 10 , budget officials in the White House and Congress will kick the law into force by producing an estimate of the current fiscal year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortfall this year , Reagan will be forced by Gramm-Rudman to order cuts totaling some $11.7 billion , half from defense and half from civilian spending that has not been specifically exempted . These reductions , known in federalese as sequestrations , will take effect March 1 . Says Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici : " It 's going to come as a shock to a lot of people who voted for this that there will be sequestering in March . " <P> Those shocks will be mild compared with the ones that will follow when the Administration presents its budget proposal for fiscal 1987 , which begins next October . That document , due in February , will have to pare planned spending by more than $50 billion to comply with Gramm-Rudman , and leaks and protests are already flowing copiously from dismayed officials and special-interest groups . Since Reagan hopes to protect defense spending , his proposals will focus on domestic programs . Among probable goals : total elimination of the Small Business Administration and Job Corps , sale of the Federal Housing Administration and certain federally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans and child-nutrition programs .
