Chase Manhattan Corp. said it agreed to acquire two Ohio thrifts and indicated that it wants to use them to establish a commercial-banking base there . Chase would become the second big New York City bank holding company to plan to take advantage of the Ohio thrift crisis to gain a foothold in that state . Chase , parent of Chase Manhattan Bank , said it intends to buy Mentor Savings Bank , in Mentor near Cleveland , and Federated Savings Bank , Cincinnati . The purchases require regulatory clearance . The two institutions are among 71 Ohio thrifts temporarily closed last month after a run on Ohio ' s privately insured thrifts ; Mentor has since reopened while Federated is operating on a limited basis , with depositors limited to withdrawals of $1 , 000 a month  --  up from an earlier limit of $750 a month . Chase would pay a total of about $15. 4 million to buy the two small thrifts and recapitalize them . The Chase announcement follows Chemical New York Corp. ' s proposal to acquire failed Home State Savings Bank in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with full banking powers . Chase said it intends to operate Mentor and Federated as federally insured savings-and-loan associations . But Thomas G. Labrecque , Chase president and chief operating officer , said Chase " would be willing to make additional acquisitions " of Ohio thrifts and join them with Mentor and Federation if Ohio grants Chase a commercial-banking license for the combined institution . In Cleveland yesterday , Chase officials said that federal and Ohio regulators have indicated that Chase would need to acquire a total of five to nine thrifts with a total asset base of $350 million to $500 million to receive consideration for a commercial-banking license in Ohio . Before Chase buys more thrifts , however , its " intention is to get a commitment from the ( Ohio ) legislature on getting a commercial-banking license , " said Arthur Ryan , executive vice president of Chase and head of its consumer-banking operation . The growing rush by New York banks into Ohio symbolizes the steady breakdown of legal restrictions against interstate banking in the U.S. On Monday , Maryland ' s state legislature approved a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up full-service banks in that state . Chase , the nation ' s third-largest bank holding company , has long harbored ambitions to expand across the U.S. And , in trying to use the thrift crisis to gain a foothold in Ohio , Chase is following a path pioneered by Citicorp , one of its New York rivals . Citicorp has bought large , ailing thrifts in Illinois , California and Florida ; in the latter two states , Chase lost out to Citicorp in bidding contests for the thrifts . Chase has been actively searching for other troubled thrifts it can acquire , bankers say . Chase said that the Ohio superintendent of savings-and-loan associations has certified that Chase ' s proposed thrift purchases qualify under applicable laws allowing acquisitions in " emergency situations . " Bankers said this will allow Chase to skirt interstate banking prohibitions by using a provision of the Bank Holding Company Act  --  exercised recently when Pennsylvania-based F.N.B. Corp. acquired Metropolitan Savings Bank of Youngstown , Ohio . It allows a bank holding company to acquire another company when its business is closely related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is proper . Chase said it has filed an application with the Fed and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for approval to acquire Mentor and Federated . This means that Chase won ' t have to go to the Ohio state legislature to win approval for its acquisitions . But Chase will need legislative action to get a commercial-banking license . Neither of the two thrifts is very big , nor do they have the big financial problems of Home State . Chase will pay $6. 8 million for Mentor , which has assets of $107 million and three offices , and add $5. 6 million to bring it up to required capital levels . It will pay $600 , 000 and contribute $2. 4 million in capital to Federated , which has one office and $54 million in assets . Chase has 65 , 000 credit-card holders in Ohio . It also has a commercial-loan office , a computer time-sharing subsidiary and an economics-forecasting service in the state .
