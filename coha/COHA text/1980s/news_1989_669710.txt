I cleaned mealie bugs off the cactus . Dogs have been fed . Benjy took the car , will be home tonight . I don ' t empty the garbage . The bag is only half full. // Laura // FOR 20 years , Laura Wienter was my devoted housekeeper caring for house , dogs , cats , plants , visiting relatives , children , and as time went on , grandchildren . ' ' Mrs. Wienter , ' ' as we all called her , brought harmony into my hectic life as I jousted with my roles of corporate wife , mother of five , mistress of the ' ' manor , ' ' and owner of a small business. // Every morning , Monday through Friday , Laura ' s rusty Volkswagen brought her to my house . Since she usually arrived after I had left for work and departed at midday , we communicated over the years largely through kitchen counter notes. // // Dear Mrs. Wienter , // Sorry the kitchen ' s such a mess , but I had to take Mr.B. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen windows are great ; what did you use ? // Mrs.B. // Dear Mrs. Burditt // I use vinegar and water plus a little ammonia . Glad you like them . Today I wax all the dining-room furniture . Thanks for the $20 for the magic purse . I think orange juice is on sale at Waldbaum ' s . I get you a case. // Laura // The orange-juice sale is just one example of Laura ' s thriftiness , which must have saved us untold dollars over the years . It was she who named the worn wrinkled leather pouch kept in a kitchen drawer ' ' the magic purse . ' ' Laura polished , scrubbed , and vacuumed with a vengeance . By Friday , the place shone ; I was constantly dismayed at how quickly a family weekend could corrode her efforts . Each Monday , the house cried out for her presence. // But our relationship went deeper than her care of house , children , and pets . Laura and I shared our love of nature - especially the birds . Each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do about the swallows that insisted on making their nest right over our front door . ' ' The swallows are back , ' ' Laura wrote . ' ' They make such a mess but they fly so far to get here . ' ' Once again her heart overruled my husband ' s head and we diverted everyone to the back door until the fledglings had flown off. // At times Laura would get down in the dumps ; then it would be my turn to cheer her up. // Dear Mrs. Burditt // Everything seemed to go wrong this a. m . The washing machine wouldn ' t drain . I found a leak under kitchen sink . Cullen had the margarine dish in the hall. // Laura // Dear Mrs. Wienter , // Sorry yesterday was such a disaster for you . Guess it ' s that time of year . Why don ' t you take Friday off ? You and Fred can take a nice drive. // Mrs.B. // Sometimes Laura would help me if I had company on a Sunday . In she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress adorned with plain costume jewelry . Thrift shops and rummage sales were her favorite dress ' ' salons . ' ' On Laura Wienter everything took on dignity . Pride never stopped her from wearing things that I gladly gave her . Yet it always startled me to see her in my mother ' s favorite tweed topcoat after Mother died. // When I first heard about Laura Wienter , all I knew was she had been born in Germany , had a husband , four children , and had cleaned and baby-sat for friends of mine . I needed help and Mrs. Wienter needed work ; thus our relationship had begun. // One day about 15 years after she came to us , Laura left on top of her daily note a brittle , yellow clipping from a German newspaper . It showed a picture of a large country home , obviously taken many years ago. // Dear Mrs. Burditt // Please call the Library ; ' ' Mr. Pudgens ' ' is in . My aunt in Germany sent me this picture of my childhood home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day I arrived home before Laura left and talked to her about the picture . Indeed , it had been her childhood home . Then the astonishing tale unfolded . Laura ' s father had been a prosperous architect in post-World War I Germany . Both sets of grandparents were wealthy . She had been brought up like a princess , with riding horses , greenhouses , and servants to wait on her . The drastic inflation of the ' 20s had ruined her father ' s practice , so in the early ' 30s he set out for America , leaving Laura , her sisters , and mother behind where they continued to be cared for by the grandparents. // During the week , Laura attended a private lyceum , but it was the Sundays she told me that she loved the most . Little did Laura realize then how different her life was going to be. // In the mid- ' 30s , Laura ' s father was convinced that there would be war in Germany . Though he was struggling financially , he sent for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Great Depression in this country . She took a job at $5 a week taking care of children during the day while ' ' making ' ' her high school diploma at night . Later , her mind set on being a dental technician , she worked in a restaurant nights to pay for this training . It was there she met Fred ; they fell in love and were married , moving soon to our suburban town . Loyally , Laura will tell you ' ' so we lived happily ever after , ' ' never mentioning meager means necessitating her to work outside the home at night to help clothe and feed the four children that soon came along . Laura Wienter long ago put the past behind her. // I was stunned by these revelations , imagining Laura as a girl riding her pony , being waited upon . What had been the source of her strength through such dramatic changes in her life : scrubbing other people ' s floors , polishing their silver , wiping their children ' s runny noses , cleaning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept her own home , husband , and four children together on a shoestring with such style and grace ? // Style is something we all assume , I guess . Laura ' s obviously stemmed from her early years . But ' ' grace ' ' is the more important attribute . I now realize that Laura ' s grace came from her lifetime love and unfaltering devotion to God . She had given , and she had received. // Laura and I exchanged our notes for another five years ; then it came time for my husband and me to retire , sell our home , and move on . For Laura and me it was difficult . She helped me through as she had so many other times , never letting on how much she was hurting about the impending separation and loss of work. // Dear Mrs. Wienter , // For the Real Estate Open House all must be perfect . I washed the arm covers for library chairs last night , as you have so many other things to do . We are so grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Mrs.B. // Dear Mrs. Burditt , // The Real Estate Open House went well . Lots of ladies came . I heard them oohing and ahing about the library especially . Don ' t worry . I think you sell the house soon . Will you please give me Terri and John ' s address . I bought a baby card for them . Hope I see you tomorrow. // Laura// //
