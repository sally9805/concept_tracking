In the office of the future , some executive prefer the past <P> The chief executive officer at a Florida financial institution demands that reports printed out by his firm 's computers be retyped on nice , white , pre-computer-revolution paper before he will even look at them . Without a hint of apology , he explains that he will not trust anything he reads on green-and-white printouts . At the headquarters of a large Atlanta company , the chairman of the board boasts that he has never touched a keyboard , and that neither he nor any of his right-hand men have a computer in their office . Explains an underling : " For these guys in their 50s , computers just are n't part of their ethic . " Such an attitude is now widespread . " The idea of an executive sitting in his office programming a computer is , well , just not realistic , " insists Ray Stata , president of Analog Devices , a computer-parts maker . John Pignataro , vice president of data processing for the Sheraton hotel chain , agrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful at lower levels .

Mervyn Weich , 44 , senior vice president of Zayre Corp. , a retailing chain , says sitting in front of a terminal and trying to extract information is unacceptably difficult and time consuming . " If I could talk to the computer as easily as I talk to my administrative assistant , yes , I 'd use it , " he explains . " But it 's a lot of work to punch in questions . My assistant is easier to work with . " Says Kerry Orr of computer maker Control Data Corp . in Atlanta : " Most executives are intimidated by a keyboard . " While computer firms insist that even the most ham-handed executive can be taught to operate a computer in a matter of hours , executive resistance remains high . Orr observes , " They normally are not honest enough to say , ' I do n't want to use it because I 'm afraid . ' "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
