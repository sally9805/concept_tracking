As the price of oil has tumbled to nearly $10 per bbl. , Mexico has been in ever greater danger of defaulting on its $98 billion foreign debt , a calamity that would shake the world financial system to its core . But Mexico took a step back from the abyss last week when its Finance Minister , Gustavo Petricioli , flew to Washington to sign an agreement with the International Monetary Fund that could generate $12 billion in new loans to spur Mexico 's economy and make up for lost oil-export revenues . The deal was noteworthy because it suggested that the IMF could be moving away from its traditional emphasis on imposing austerity programs and toward a policy of promoting faster growth in debtor nations . <P> As usual , the IMF is requiring Mexico to restrain its public spending , but the country will be allowed to run a budget deficit that amounts to 10% of its gross domestic product .

The bankers , who were stunned at the size of the request , say that negotiations on the terms of the loans could take months . But large creditors like New York 's Citicorp ( $2.8 billion already on loan to Mexico ) will almost certainly have to go along with the IMF in order to reduce the risk of a default .
