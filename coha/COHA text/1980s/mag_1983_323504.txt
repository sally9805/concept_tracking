James Levine is the most powerful opera conductor in America <P> Oh ! to be a conductor , to weld a hundred men into one singing giant , to build up the most gorgeous arabesques of sound , to wave a hand and make the clamoring strings sink to a mutter , to wave again , and hear the brass crashing out in triumph , to throw up a finger , then another and another , and to know that with every one the orchestra would bound forward into a still more ecstatic surge and sweep , to fling oneself forward , and for a moment or so keep everything still , frozen , in the hollow of one 's hand , and then to set them all singing and soaring in one final sweep , with the cymbals clashing at every flicker of one 's eyelid , to sound the grand Amen . <P> - J.B . Priestley <P> The burly figure standing calmly on the podium of a darkened opera house pit bears little resemblance to the conventionally glamorous image of a famous conductor . At 205 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is built more like a stagehand than an aristocratic maestro , and his round face , capped by a corona of curly hair , is a world away from the suave image of a Leonard Bernstein . Yet as his baton comes slashing down with swift , chopping strokes , he is abruptly transformed into a figure of grace . Cuing the orchestra , effortlessly guiding singers through an opera 's trickiest passages , joyfully but inaudibly singing along , he has become Priestley 's ideal personified . And why not ? James Levine , 39 , is doing what he was born to do . <P> Not since Bernstein has an American-born , American-trained conductor had such an astonishing career . As music director and principal conductor of New York City 's Metropolitan Opera , one of the world 's top opera companies , Levine wields an international influence . During the summers , when he is not working at the Met , he leads the Chicago Symphony as music director of the Ravinia Festival . He is in demand as a guest conductor , and such is his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs , Levine 's name ( it rhymes with divine ) is invariably mentioned as a possible successor . A talented pianist , he often finds time to squeeze a chamber concert or two between conducting appearances . <P> Nor is his activity limited to America . Since 1975 , Levine has appeared regularly at the prestigious Salzburg Festival in Austria , leading widely acclaimed productions of Mozart 's The Magic Flute and La Clemenza di Tito in the composer 's home town . When Wolfgang Wagner , grandson of Richard , was seeking a conductor for last summer 's centennial production of Parsifal at Bayreuth , Levine was his choice . " Jimmy 's star is going up , " says a member of the Chicago Symphony . " I do n't think anything will interrupt the rise . " Levine talks about his ascent to prominence with a characteristic mixture of pride and hyperbole . " Every year my life gets better , " he says . " It 's all sort of like a dream . It 's so nice . " <P> The dream , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently works with Levine at the Met : " The rapport he establishes is so wonderful , it is really a joy to make music with him . " When Bernstein heard Levine lead his first Parsifal at the Met , in 1979 , he broke into tears . " It was the best Parsifal I ever heard , " he recalls .
