The extensions in the picture were what told so much about the game and the season and even the seasons before that . The extensions . All of the extensions . There was wide receiver Dwight Clark , a study in extensions . See how high his feet were off the ground ? See how far he was reaching ? See how the football was touched only by the absolute tips of his fingers ? Extensions . See how he was at the absolute edge of the end zone , behind the word " 49ers " and almost off the end of the red paint ? See how close this was to the end of not only the game but all of their fairy tale daydreams ? See ? Extensions . The San Francisco Forty-Niners were going to the Super Bowl , reaching out , going further than anyone ever could have expected , and this was the final reach of them all . Symbolic , no ? Damned if Dwight Clark didn ' t catch the football . " I didn ' t even see the catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback Joe Montana burbled after the 28- 27 win over the Dallas Cowboys for the National Football Conference title was complete and this city had gone into one grand celebration late yesterday afternoon . " That play was unbelievable , wasn ' t it ? How ' d he ever catch that ball ? " How ? How did Clark catch the 6-yard pass from Montana at the edge of the spongy Candlestick Park end zone with 51 seconds remaining ? How did Montanathrow the ball , a trio of large and hungry Cowboys bearing down on him as if he were the last ham sandwich left in the free world ? How did a team that had given away the football six times during the sunny afternoon suddenlyhang on to it for a 13- play , 89-yard , game-winning drive ? Heck , what about the biggest " how " of all ? How did the San Francisco Forty-Niners , a team that won only six of 16 football games just a year ago , do what they ' ve done ? How indeed . " There ' s just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " quarterback Montana said . " There came a time during this season when we started thinking that we could go to the Super Bowl - why not ? - and we ' ve just kept playing as if we could . " They were lovely , these Forty-Niners , filled with their roster of phone- book names , recognizable only about as far as the Bay Area Rapid Transit travels . Working their big moment , their big day at the end of their big season , playing against the conglomerate best in the NFL , these young San Francisco overachievers simply didn ' t blink . Pressure ? What pressure ? They played one of those Ping-Pong games with the Cowboys , the lead and good fortune and bad changing back and forth , and in the end , they still were driving . Still in control . " I predicted how the game would end in the middle of the third quarter , " Dwight Clark said in a gentle Southern drawl . " I was coming off the field , and I told ( tight end ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to end with somebody doing something spectacular with four seconds left . " I never had any idea it would be me . . . but I ' ll take the way it happened . " The final drive was cut out of a self-imporvement guide on how these things should be done . A simply led to B , and C simply followed in a natural , dramatic progression . No rush , no hurry , just solid , chew-up-the-field work . " The confidence was just there , " Montana said . " Everyone had it . " There were 4:54 remaining when the drive began . Trailing , 27-21 , the Forty-Niners needed the touchdown , so the Cowboys were willing to surrender some easier pieces of turf . The Forty-Niners were willing to take . Using journeyman running back Lenvil Elliott , a backup guy who had been released from football at the beginning of the year , returned and then been injured in the middle , Montana simply punched the ball along the ground for a while . Elliott simply ran in the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing special about it , " he said . " I ' d come around the end and there ' d always be two guards with me and I ' d just follow ' em along . Follow and try to get out of bounds . That ' s all I was thinking . " At midfield by the time of the two-minute warning , Montana then threw a double reverse at the Cowboys , wide receiver Freddie Solomon rolling for 14 yards . Then Montana started throwing . " I ' d made some mistakes today , " the former Notre Dame quarterback said , " so I had to be thinking about that . Three interceptions and a fumble . Those are mistakes . " There were none of those problems now . He hit Clark for 10 yards , a weird sideline bullet that zipped between two Dallas defensive backs . He hit Solomon for 12 . He missed Solomon on a pass into the end zone , then ran Elliott for 7 yards , then rolled into the play that started San Francisco celebrating . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montana said . " It was the same play we used to score our first touchdown . He was covered , though , so the next guy I look for is Dwight . " The idea is to throw the ball high to him so it ' s either a touchdown or out of the end zone . High . . . but not that high . " The rest was in the picture . The extensions . San Francisco ? In the Super Bowl ? How ? There was a little matter of stopping Dallas ' final drive , but once that was accomplished with a thumping tackle by tackle Lawrence Pillars that forced Dallas quarterback Danny White to fumble , the good folk of Candlestick started dancing . " What ' d you feel when you recovered the ball and held it at the end ? " a defensive end named Jim Stuckey , the man who sat on the ball White fumbled , was asked . He breathed deeply before delivering his answer . " Total personal jubilation , " Jim Stuckey replied . The utlimate extension . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
