Mischief Makers By Nettie Jones Weidenfeld &; Nicolson , 163 pages , $16. 95 Nettie Jones ' first novel , " Fish Tales , " published in 1984 , was both highly praised and rudely damned . " Fish Tales " was an episodic novel in the manner of Renata Adler ' s " Speedboat , " comprising short scenes , the hearts of vignettes , and was a story of one woman ' s contradictory oppression and satisfaction through sex , drugs and alcohol , rendered in graphic , uncompromising prose . It was a cathartic book , scalding in its honesty , marred only by a slightly obscure ending . " Mischief Makers , " her second novel , is a large step beyond and away from " Fish Tales " both in content and narrative form . " Mischief Makers " is in many ways a minimalist saga novel . Its brief 163 pages cover three generations , span the 1920s to the 1950s and depict a slice of black history not much covered by contemporary writers . If one compares Nettie Jones to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Fish Tales , " she exchanges long sexual description for extended depictions of violence and , as in " Mischief Makers , " she often deals with subjects that are not in current political fashion , such as the slippery issues of blacks " passing " as white and assimilation . The family tree in her novel holds people of both colors and the experience of diaspora as Southern blacks go north , some floating out of their pasts on the ether of light skin . As pernicious as the laws of the old ( and not-so-old ) South were in specifying exactly who was " a Negro " by calculating the smallest fractions of black " blood , " the laws ' existence did at least demonstrate how commonplace such mixed racial heritage is in America . The matriarchal protagonist of " Mischief Makers " is Raphael de Baptiste , the daughter of light-skinned professional parents . She leaves Detroit for upper Michigan to work as a nurse and passes for white . Raphael meets and marries Mishe Masaube , a Chippewa Indian who has land and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilly and Puma . Their lives and fates become the novel ' s subject ( Raphael dies giving birth to a fourth child , a stillborn male ) ; each daughter learns , in her own way and time , of her forebears . But what they chiefly are-and it would seem to be Jones ' point-is very American . Though lip service is still paid to the old melting-pot aspect of the American dream , more energy of late has been spent reinforcing narrower , tribal " ethnic " identities , leading various national and racial groups to separate themselves from the mainstream while asserting that they are the " true " Americans . Jones ' novel offers another history . Lilly is killed in Detroit ' s race riot of the summer of 1943 . Blossom Rose is blinded by a bullet meant for her aunt . Puma flourishes . There is melodrama here , but the prose of " Mischief Makers " is serene . It has the feel of old stories being told , turned smooth and handsomely polished by being handed down from one generation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so is " Mischief Makers , " though for entirely different reasons . Jones has managed to tell a very complicated story with calculated simplicity , and the characters , though broadly sketched , are never stereotypes . They are all tangible , flesh and blood . As daring as " Fish Tales " was in matters of sex , " Mischief Makers " is even more daring in its portrait of color and class in America . Jones is a mischief-maker indeed.
