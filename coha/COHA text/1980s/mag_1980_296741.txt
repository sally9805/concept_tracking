Vance offers a warning <P> When Jimmy Carter waspishly slighted his departed Secretary of State Cyrus Vance , saying that he hoped Vance 's successor would be " a stronger and more statesmanlike figure , " Vance stoically said nothing . Last week , for the first time since he resigned in protest against the Iranian rescue mission , Vance spoke out in a major address . His message , as would have been expected , was strong and statesmanlike . <P> Vance mentioned Carter only once , with words of praise for his energy program . He never mentioned his pugnacious rival . National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , at all . But he must have been recalling past arguments in Washington when he warned a Harvard commencement audience of 25,000 against " a dangerous new nostalgia , " a " longing for earlier days , when the world seemed , at least in retrospect , to have been a more orderly place , in which American power could , alone , preserve that order . " U.S. armed forces " must be modernized , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " preserve the global military balance . " But the hope that U.S. military power can solve any problem is " self-indulgent nonsense . " <P> " It is time to set , and stick to , basic goals , " Vance declared . " Neither we nor the world can afford an American foreign policy that is hostage to the emotions of the moment . . . It is far too easy , in an election year , to let what may seem smart politics produce bad policies . " <P> That , he argued , was what had happened to the SALT II treaty , which Carter shelved after the Afghanistan invasion seemed to doom all chance of Senate ratification . The U.S. must " continue its firm and sustained response to Soviet aggression against Afghanistan , " said Vance , but it must also maintain a larger historical perspective . " When the historian of 1990 looks back upon the year 1980 , " Vance stressed , " I believe a profound mistake may well be identified : a failure to ratify the SALT II treaty . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe that the Senate must ratify the SALT II treaty before the end of this year . " <P> That prospect is unlikely indeed , but Vance insisted that SALT still could preserve " essential equivalence " with the Soviets . Yet even that provides only a framework for seeking better relations with the Soviets . " It is foolish and dangerous to believe that we can manage this relationship by deterrence alone , " said Vance . " We will also need to provide positive incentives . We must work for implicit , if not explicit , agreements to bound our competition by restraints , by a kind of common law of competition ... We can not afford wild swings from being too trusting to being hysterical . " <P> Vance predicted that " the cockpit of crises " in the coming decade would be the Third World . He recommended certain specific steps-recognition of the leftist regime in Angola and improved relations with Zimbabwe and Mozambique . But throughout the underdeveloped lands of Africa and Asia , he said , people " do not want the rhetoric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. foreign aid has declined 25% in the past 25 years , and the U.S. now ranks 13th among the top 17 industrial nations in the percentage of gross national product devoted to foreign aid . Vance 's judgment on that : " Disgraceful . "
