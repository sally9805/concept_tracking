" I ' d love to be able to do it , " he was saying now from St. Louis , where he was to work last night ' s other ABC game , " but I ' d probably have some slips and say ' we ' and ' us . ' That ' s all right if you ' re employed by a team as a broadcaster . I caught Bobby Murcer last week and he had a few of those ' we ' and ' us ' for the Yankees . But it ' s no good on national television , where half the people listening to you are rooting for the other team. " // But sooner or later Earl Weaver might be tempted to terminate his Oriole contract that extends through next season . That way , he could be in the booth at Oriole games. // Without his Oriole contract , Earl Weaver also could be contacted directly by another major league club hoping to persuade him to manage again . When the New York Mets and the Chicago Cubs asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s content being a broadcaster . If a club were to contact him directly during the term of the contract , it could be accused of " tampering " with an Oriole employee. // " Teams asking if I might be interested in managing again , that ' s going to happen , " he said . " Most owners want a guy who ' s served some time in the major leagues . An owner has to have a lot of confidence in a guy coming up from managing in the minors to hire him as a major league manager . But it happened with me , with Dave Bristol , with Sparky Anderson , with Walter Alston , with Joe McCarthy , all of us came out of the minors. " // I n selecting a new manager following Earl Weaver ' s decision to retire , the Orioles chose Joe Altobelli , the Yankees ' third-base coach the last two years . But he had Oriole roots , having managed in their farm system before the San Francisco Giants hired him in 1977 , only to dismiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National League manager-of-the-year award in 1978. // " I recommended Joe when he first started managing in the Oriole system , at Bluefield , West Virginia , in 1966 , " Earl Weaver said . " Joe and I talked throughout spring training about the club , but each manager has to make his own decisions . It ' s amazing they ' re staying up there with their pitching problems . Mike Flanagan ' s out with a bad knee . Jim Palmer has been on the disabled list . Dennis Martinez is off to a bad start. " // Dennis Martinez , a Nicaraguan right-hander who had a 16-12 record last year and a 14-5 record the year before , has a 4-11 record this season. // Prior to last night ' s game , the Orioles were tied with the surprisingly tenacious Toronto Blue Jays for first place in the American League East. // " Bobby Cox has done a good job platooning that Toronto ball club , " Earl Weaver said . " They ' ve got a lot of good young ballplayers up there . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oakland club back in 1970 and 1971 before they won those three straight World Series . You could see that Oakland team was going to be real good . Toronto is beginning to look that way now . " <> A s for the Yankees , a team on a treadmill , Earl Weaver predicted that their depth would be important in the final months. // " You can get second-guessed sometimes with all that depth , " he said . " You ' ve got Piniella and Gamble , Kemp and Griffey and Baylor , and if you put one of them in the lineup and he doesn ' t do anything , people wonder why the other guy wasn ' t in the lineup . If a guy has an off-night , it makes for a little confusion . But when the fatigue starts in August and September , those players will be rested . The only thing is , the Yankees ' pitching has got to come through . " Meanwhile , some of the Orioles , some good-naturedly , continue to talk about how Joe Altobelli has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusty approach. // " When Joe said hello to me the first day of spring training , " Jim Palmer , who often debated with Earl Weaver , has said , " he broke the other guy ' s all-time career record. " // That line has been repeated wherever the Orioles have gone this season , but according to the " other guy , " Jim Palmer first uttered it at a golf tournament they both attended. // " And then Palmer kept using that line at banquets over the course of the winter and getting a good laugh with it , " Earl Weaver was saying now . " We all have our canned speeches. " // Another pitcher , Mike Flanagan , remembered that Earl Weaver " never asked what I wanted to throw , he ' d look at his card and say , ' This guy is 9 for 27 against the fastball , throw him a curve . ' Joe gives us a little more credit to know what we have on a given day . " But that criticism disturbs Earl Weaver. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " who makes a pitcher pitch his game . " The umpires , of course , must be pleased by Earl Weaver ' s departure to the TV booth . So far this season , Joe Altobelli has been ejected from only one game . During his 14 1/2 seasons , Earl Weaver was thrown out of 89 games , including one World Series game and a few in spring training ; he was suspended for a total of 19 games , including 3 in spring training. // " I ' ve seen some of the umpires , we ' re friends , " he said . " Last year I signed a ball for Dave Phillips ' s father , who once threw me out of an Eastern League game long before Dave threw me out in the big leagues . They were the only father-son combination to get me . But over the winter his father died and Dave told me how much his father had appreciated that ball. " // But skeptics believe that someday Earl Weaver will be a manager again . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " No way of knowing that , though. " //
