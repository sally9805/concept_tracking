The collection includes 30 pages of a draft , unknown until now , in Melville ' s handwriting of chapters of his first novel , " Typee , " a different ending for his enigmatic short story , " Bartleby the Scrivener , " revelations about the intensity of his writing methods and facts about his " fairly normal " relationship with his wife. // The papers include 141 letters with specific references to the author , 380 letters from family members that provide new biographical information , communications between Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne that show their friendship , and revelations about what the reading public of Melville ' s time thought about his work . ( If at all , they talked more about his magazine stories than his novels. ) // One of the letters , dated Dec. 8 , 1841 , from Lansingburgh , N.Y. , is from Melville ' s mother to her daughter : // " My dear Augusta , Last week I received a long letter from Herman , who has embarked for a long voyage to the Pacific under the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the last and assisted with his more mature judgment in supplying him with every comfort . Gansevoort says he never saw him so completely happy as when he had determined upon a situation and all was settled. " // <> <> Bound for the South Seas // The " Herman " was , of course , Melville , then age 21 , helped by his older brother , Gansevoort . The " situation " was a seaman ' s berth on the maiden voyage of the whaling vessel Acushnet , which had sailed from New Bedford harbor on Jan. 3 , 1841 , bound for the South Seas - and literary history. // That voyage led to " Typee , " which Melville originally titled " A Narrative of Four Months ' Residence Among the Natives of a Valley of the Marquesas Islands . " From this " situation " and similar experiences would come a novel in 1851 called " Moby-Dick. " // Among the papers is the 30-page first draft of roughly two chapters of " Typee , " carefully labeled by Melville - as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and readers did not . The draft is the greatest number of pages existing in manuscript form of any of Melville ' s books published while he was alive. // " The discovery of such a quantity of unpublished Melville material is of major importance to the literary world , " said Donald Anderle , director of rare books and manuscripts at the library . He obtained the papers from John and Carolyn DeMarco , the owners of the Lyrical Ballad Bookstore in Saratoga Springs , N.Y. , who represented the elderly woman who owned the barn . The woman prefers to remain anonymous and is referred to simply as " Mrs. H. " // <> <> Examining the Manuscripts // In the library ' s board room this afternoon , professors from universities all over the country who are attending the annual meeting of the Melville Society are scheduled to examine the manuscripts , letters , memorabilia and trunks . A few leading scholars already have been shown photocopies of the material . In advance of the meeting , several of them were asked to comment on the discovery. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our time , " said Prof. Donald Yannella of Glassboro State College , N.J. , who is secretary-treasurer of the Melville Society . " The ' Typee ' manuscript alone tells us something fresh about his carefulness as a writer . The first draft differs greatly from the published version. " // Prof. Warner Berthoff of Harvard , the president of the Melville Society , said : " I ' m glad the papers ended up in New York because Melville was a New Yorker , not a New Englander. " // <> <> ' All Sorts of Flashing Lights ' // According to Prof. Jay Leyda of New York University , who is the editor of " The Melville Log , " a two-volume work he is now updating : " The papers have all sorts of flashing lights where there was darkness before. " // " For example , " Professor Leyda said , " there is a completely new picture of his relations with his wife , showing their life together to be fairly normal . Some Melville detractors claimed that they had a terrible marriage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wrote very intensely , sometimes passing whole days without eating . His family would leave a tray outside his door so he wouldn ' t be disturbed . When dinner trays were brought up in the evening , the lunch trays would still be there. " // Professor Yannella said : " There is a different ending to his 1853 short story , ' Bartleby the Scrivener . ' In the draft , Melville ends the story with Bartleby not in a fetal position but stretched out , and there is no coda as there is in the printed version. " // Somewhere below the narrow stairs , in the manuscript rooms of the library , Mr. Anderle and Susan Davis , the curator , showed a visitor the dark , mid-19th-century leather trunks and wooden chest and two black tin signs lettered in fading gold . One read : " Melvill , French Goods . " The second : " Gansevoort Melville , Attorney and Solicitor. " // <> <> Tales From Memorabilia // Even these bits of memorabilia had tales to tell . After the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importer and merchant whose wife ' s family had often bailed him out , an " e " was added to the Melvill name . Gansevoort Melville , Herman ' s brother , was secretary of the American Legation in London and helped to get " Typee " published in England by John Murray under its longer title , after it had been rejected by Harper &; Brothers here . Only then was it published by Wiley &; Putnam in New York. // How the Melville papers were found in a barn and came to rest in the New York Public Library is a story in itself . At its center are the DeMarcos , the owners of the Lyrical Ballad Bookstore . Both were English majors at Albany State University before opening their bookstore in 1971 and , fortunately , both knew their Melville. // The DeMarcos were put in touch with an antiques dealer , Jack Guerrera of Hudson Falls , N.Y. He revealed that a certain " Mrs. H. " owned the collection. // The trunks once belonged to Augusta Melville , who had inherited them from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the Gansevoort home , and the family of " Mrs. H. " at one time owned that house . The possessions of both families had been mixed together and , later , " Mrs. H. " stored them in her barn. // The DeMarcos decided that since Melville was a New Yorker and the New York Public Library already owned Melville material , the library should get first crack at the collection. // Last May , Mr. Anderle and Mrs. Davis checked the handwritings and saw that everything matched . In June , accompanied by G. Thomas Tanselle , a Melville scholar , they made a final inspection. // A " fair price " was agreed to which , according to Mr. Anderle , was far less than the papers would have cost in the open market . On July 5 , accompanied by a security guard , Mr. Anderle and Mrs. Davis loaded the Melville papers into a library car and headed south for Melville ' s Manhattan. //                    @
