An officer out in the cold <P> He was an honest cop in the Frank Serpico mold . Early in the spring of 1982 , A'Roterick McLaughlin , a 15-year veteran of the Chicago police force , went undercover to nab officers who dealt drugs , sometimes peddling the stuff from their squad-car windows . He played the role of a neophyte dealer , wearing miniature microphones when he met with corrupt police . His work led to the conviction of ten policemen and the indictment of three others , none of whom have yet started serving any time in prison . It also made him a target for revenge . <P> McLaughlin assumed a new name and was relocated , along with his wife and their three children , to a city in Georgia . Now , two years after he left Chicago , McLaughlin is convinced he has been discovered and marked for death . He says that he was stopped last month by three men on a street near his new home . Brandishing a pistol , one of the men ordered him to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a deserted wooded area , forced him out of the car and began beating him , at one point brutally stomping on his head . " Cut his hand off ! Cut his hand off ! " one of the trio yelled . Recalls McLaughlin : " I came up fighting then . I took off running . I was bleeding everywhere , and I heard a shot ring out behind me . " He made it to the safety of a well-traveled street and called the police . But the assault may have permanently destroyed the vision in McLaughlin 's right eye . <P> Officials at the Cook County state 's attorney 's office , which paid for McLaughlin 's relocation , say the incident was simply a robbery ( McLaughlin 's attackers did take his watch ) . " There is absolutely nothing to indicate these three men knew who their victim was , " says Assistant State 's Attorney John Armellino . " We are limited by law as to what we can do for a witness , " says Prosecutor Frank DeBoni , " and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . " <P> Thomas Chandler and Victor Howard , two internal-affairs division officers who worked with McLaughlin in uncovering the drug ring , strongly disagree . They also claim to have been threatened recently ; a package arrived last month at their Chicago headquarters with cut-up animal parts , two dead fish , and a note reading , " Death for you and yours . " Howard says that McLaughlin 's assailants knew who he was : " The message those attackers gave him was ' You broke the code , and nobody is going to get away with that . ' " A police officer in Georgia who is familiar with the case , explaining why some facts were not included in the public report of the incident , confirmed that McLaughlin is considered in danger and that " maybe someone is out to get him . " <P> McLaughlin , who allowed TIME to use his real name but requested that his current home town be kept secret , has no doubt that his ordeal stems from his undercover work . After pressure by McLaughlin , Howard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late last week to pay for his relocation to a new , undisclosed place . " If I had to do it all over again , I do n't think I would , " he says . " No one told me it would be this way . I was just trying to do my job , be a good cop , do what I thought was right . "
