FAIRFIELD , Conn.  --  General Electric Co. said third-quarter earnings rose 13% , boosted by improved results in engineered plastics , materials and construction equipment . Sales for the quarter increased 3% . For the economy as a whole , GE said it expects a faster growth rate in capital spending and a decline in the growth rate for consumer durables , which are items such as machinery and household furnishings that are useful at least three years . " With respect to the economic outlook , we are approaching the end of the second year of a recovery , driven initially by consumer durables and housing markets but lately shifting more to a capital spending impetus , " said John F. Welch Jr. , chairman . " GE ' s own incoming order rates are tending to reflect these trends . " Net income for the third quarter rose to $564 million , or $1. 24 a share , from $499 million , or $1. 10 a share , a year earlier . Sales increased to $6. 72 billion from $6. 55 billion .

Adjusted for GE ' s divestiture earlier this year of its housewares business and Utah International Inc. , the nine-month earnings rose 8% and sales increased 10% from a year earlier , GE said . " As we move into the third year of the recovery , most forecasters , including our own , expect the usual slowdown , but there is also optimism that inflationary pressures won ' t return , " Mr. Welch said . GE ' s chief economist , Walter K. Joelson , said in a telephone interview that the economy has begun to slow after an unexpectedly strong growth rate in the past 18 months . " We think it will continue to slow down as we go into 1985 , " he said . The economic growth rate next year , he said , will drop to about 3% or 4% from about 7% early in the recovery . The slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflationary pressures less likely , " Mr. Joelson said . " As we go into 1985 we expect the growth in capital spending will be greater than the economy as a whole , " he said . " But housing and consumer durable goods will be growing at a rate slower than the economy as a whole . " In the third quarter , earnings and revenue from aircraft engines " were substantially higher as military sales continued strong and the commercial aircraft business showed an improving trend , " GE said . GE also cited " excellent volume in commercial and industrial lighting products " and " improvements " in large steam and gas turbine sales . GE said its new nonconsolidated affiliate , General Electric Financial Services Inc. , which includes General Electric Credit Corp. and Employers Reinsurance Corp. , had third-quarter operating profit of $82 million . GE said transportation markets and international construction were among its weak spots in the third quarter . " Export sales for the quarter were about 8% less than a year ago , and Latin American markets remain very weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company said , " The strong performance by aerospace was more than offset by a higher level of program and start-up costs for new products in factory automation and medical systems .
