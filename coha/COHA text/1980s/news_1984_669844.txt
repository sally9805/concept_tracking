DETROIT  --  General Motors Corp. said it will extend production of its 1984-model small cars into October and November in a maneuver to escape $100 million or more in government fines for failing to meet fuel-economy standards . The action will put about 227 , 000 more high-mileage cars into GM ' s 1984-model production , boosting its corporate average in fuel economy about 0. 3 miles per gallon . The federal government calculates a fuel-economy figure for each auto company at the end of each model year . It is a production-weighted average of the rated fuel economy of each car model a company offers . GM said the production change will raise its corporate fuel economy for 1984 to 25 mpg . Though that falls short of the federal standard of 27 mpg , the company said its credits from past years when it exceeded the standards will be enough to offset the difference and enable the company to avoid fines . It was the latest in a number of fuel-economy strategies that GM has used to counter the effects of unexpectedly strong big-car sales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep building some larger , less-fuel-efficient cars for a longer period of time or in greater numbers than planned . As a result , GM ' s fleet fuel economy has fallen below minimum federal requirements . Ford Motor Co. also expects to fall short of the 27 mpg requirement for the 1984 model year . The company said it has enough credits to offset the difference without any unusual juggling of production schedules . Earlier , GM succeeded in getting the government to adjust the fuel-economy ratings of it and other companies upward by 0. 2 mpg to correct what was regarded as a distortion in the mileage-testing procedures . As reported , GM also plans to ask the government to change the fuel-economy rules to allow its joint-venture small car , to be built with Toyoto Motor Co. in California , to be included in calculating its corporate fuel economy . That could raise GM ' s 1985 fuel economy a further 0. 3 mpg , the government estimates . GM normally would have stopped production of 1984 models in July and August and changed over to 1985 models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 J-body subcompacts until Oct. 23 , and its Chevrolet Chevette , Pontiac T1000 and Pontiac Fiero until Nov. 21 . By switching 227 , 000 cars to the current model year , GM takes those fuel-efficient cars out of its 1985-model-year production and penalizes its corporate fuel economy for 1985 , when the federal mileage standard rises to 27. 5 mpg . But some observers expect GM to ask the Transportation Department to simply reduce the 1985 standard . The secretary of transportation is empowered to lower the requirement to 26 mpg without permission of Congress . GM officials have said they don ' t believe a request to lower the 1984 standard would succeed because it is a presidential election year , and the Reagan administration already has been accused of softness on auto regulations . Stanley Hall , a GM spokesman , said that GM also has two new lines of fuel-efficient , front-wheel-drive cars entering production as 1985 models that should improve its corporate fuel economy . But he said the company doesn ' t expect to meet the 27. 5 mpg standard either , and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surpass the standards in 1986 through 1988 . Mr. Hall said GM this year will exhaust its remaining $250 million in credits gained in past years . The fuel-economy law levies a fine of $5 for every 0. 1 mpg that a company falls short of the standard , multiplied by the number of cars the company built in the model year . Without this year ' s production change , Mr. Hall said , GM could have been fined $100 million to $150 million . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
