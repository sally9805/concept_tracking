Police Lieut . Vincent Mora has just slipped between the sheets with Casino Singer Linda Moon when he hears a click at the door of his Atlantic City hotel room . With the barrel of his gun , he scoops up his Jockey shorts , pulls them on and is ready to meet the intruder . Wild shots are fired . The would-be killer escapes into the street with a chilly Mora in vain pursuit . On his way back to Miss Moon , he meets a drunk who gives him some sporting advice : " You should a bet your underwear . You never know when your luck 'll change . " <P> Elmore Leonard gives this piece of business a nice wrinkle by delaying the punch line for eleven pages . Do n't ask how ; the ploy works like the rim shot of a drummer perking up a lounge comic 's routine . Leonard may not be the tightest plotter on the popular thriller circuit , but he is the writer who pays closest attention to getting the tacky details right . Bribing a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen only in the Philadelphia-South Jersey axis of ethnic indigestibles . <P> Glitz , Leonard 's 25th novel , lives up to its title . The settings are San Juan and Atlantic City ( " It 's like you 're in a hotel in Star Trek " ) , and its characters operate low to the ground and leave slimy trails . One of them is after Mora , 41 , a Miami policeman convalescing in Puerto Rico from a mugger 's bullet that chipped his hipbone . The wound initially looked worse than it was , because the second shot shattered a half-gallon of Gallo Hearty Burgundy that Mora was carrying , along with a jar of Ragu spaghetti sauce and a bottle of prune juice . The items suggest that the lieutenant is no oenophile , dislikes cooking and suffers from constipation . More important , a grocery list is Leonard 's shorthand way of establishing his hero 's endearing authenticity as a middle-aged widower who , despite badge and gun , falls victim to street crime . <P> The bad guys require additional work , partly because most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because embellishing evil is fun . Teddy Magyk , the creep who stalks Mora from the Caribbean to the Jersey shore , lives with his mother in Margate , in a house done up in a parrot motif . One of his specialties is robbing and raping elderly women . He is between jail sentences and is bent on killing his arresting officer . Who is , of course , Lieut . Mora . <P> Glitz departs from the usual tense stalker plot in a number of ways . Teddy 's incidental murders are described with a casualness that underscores his sickening emotional vacuum . For some doubtful reason , Mora treats Magyk 's threat nonchalantly even though he acknowledges that psychopaths are unpredictable and extremely dangerous . But then , Leonard always seems more interested in sociology than suspense . His supporting cast springs from that circle where commerce , show business and crime are hard to separate . Casino Manager Jackie Garbo likes to impress visitors with his autographed celebrity photos . Bodyguard Moosleh Hajim Jabara strains parody as an Ethiopian-born retired pro-football player who changed his name to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma and Miss Congeniality well on her way to such titles as Miss Cordial and Miss Bloody Mary . The rub-out of a Mafioso in the mandatory spaghetti joint summons up the sensible suggestion , " You 'd think those guys 'd learn to eat some other kind of food . "
