She is a writer . She composes devotional poems , all of them above reproach . But she is also writing a play , based on pagan Roman models , and I can see how your Bishop , since he has somehow heard of it , may be alarmed . Let us see if there is anything to be alarmed about . Will you hear our Sister describe her work ? ( Brother William , face hidden in his hood , nods . ) Sister . ( Enter Hrosvitha , a nun . She is composed but she is thrilled by this event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaks to Brother William . ) HROSVITHA My play is called Ave Maria . It is written to be performed by the Sisters of the Convent , with music composed for it here . I will gladly tell you its story . ( She smiles , excited by her tale . ) Abraham is a hermit . He has a niece named Mary . ( Around her , the lights change . They bathe her in a warm glow . They light the rug brightly . ) When she is a child , Mary 's parents die . Abraham adopts her . He builds a little cell for her , near his own , where he watches over her , hears her prayers and instructs her in divine law . ( Enter Mary , dressed in white , and seen only by Hrosvitha . She kneels . ) Under his care , Mary becomes beautiful and devout . Abraham hears her prayers and her hymns every day , and thanks God for the happiness she gives him , for he wants her to enter a convent and become the bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's robe , holding a large cross in one arm , draped with a rosary of beads . He also is only seen by Hrosvitha . He kneels . ) " I am happy , " says Mary . " My Guardian Abraham means  --  p. 4 MARY "  --  means everything to me . I love to worship and study and pray and be near him . " HROSVITHA " I am happy , " says Abraham . " My niece Mary means  --  ABRAHAM "  --  everything to me . I love to worship and study and pray and be near her . " MARY I will always do whatever he says . ABRAHAM I will send her to God , in heaven . ( Music ends . Lights change . Mary turns her back . ) HROSVITHA . One day , when Mary is seventeen years old , Abraham has a vision . ( Abraham , walking in front of Hrosvitha , throws his arm in front of his face and kneels . ) ABRAHAM Ah ! ( Hrosvitha rushes to him , stands behind him , seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon-like monster , with a horrifying stench  --  ABRAHAM rushes violently toward me ! He wants to eat a little dove I have tied to my wrist . He knocks me over , seizes my little bird in his jaws , and devours it ! HROSVITHA ( With a large gesture . ) Then he vanishes , in smoke ! ABRAHAM When I open my eyes , I am blind . I throw myself into prayer , for two days . Then , exhausted , I fall asleep . And I dream I see the beast again . But now it is lying at my feet , no longer terrible or frightening . Just a huge sleeping animal . And the dove is flying to heaven , safe and free ! I awake , weeping , and I can see again ! p. 5 HROSVITHA He wonders what the vision means ! ABRAHAM Oh , the most awful uneasiness takes hold of me . Thinking of the monster asleep and the dove free , I remember Mary , my little niece , my pupil . For three days , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her cell ! He knocks at her window ! ( Abraham moves to an imaginary cell . Hrosvitha follows him . ) ABRAHAM " Mary ? My child ? Mary ? Why wo n't you answer me ? Mary ? " HROSVITHA She 's gone ! ABRAHAM Mary ! ( He strides away in anguish . Hrosvitha follows him . ) " What wolf has stolen my Mary ? What devil has defiled her ? " HROSVITHA A hypocrite ! ABRAHAM In a monk 's robe ? HROSVITHA He came to her with prayers and sugared words ! He made the girl fall in love with him ! ABRAHAM Mary ? HROSVITHA He seduced her and he abandoned her ! When Mary realized what she had done , she tore her hair , dug her nails into her face and ran away ! ABRAHAM Mary ! HROSVITHA She is gone , Abraham . p. 6 ABRAHAM Where ? HROSVITHA Into the world . She has fallen . ABRAHAM Fallen ? How ? HROSVITHA It hurts me to tell you this . ABRAHAM Please ! HROSVITHA She lives in a inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange men ? My Mary ?

As a lover they will let me in ! HROSVITHA That will break your vows ! ( He hands her his cross . ) ABRAHAM Then I will break my vows ! ( He holds up a widebrimmed hat that has been hanging from his shoulder , and spreads his cloak over his hermit 's robe . ) With my face hidden by this hat , and my robe by this cloak , I will go to that place and bring her back to me , and to God !

ABRAHAM Where 's the bedroom ? MARY This way , Mister . ( Leading Abraham by the hand , Mary takes him in a circle . ) HROSVITHA She takes him by the hand ! They pass through a dark hallway , climb some stairs , and enter her bedroom ! ( Mary leads Abraham to the center of the rug . ) MARY So lie down . ABRAHAM All right .

MARY Leave me alone ! ABRAHAM I bought you , remember ? You 're mine ! MARY Ah ! ( Mary curls up on the carpet , knees drawn up , arms over her head , crying . ) ABRAHAM Who was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A devil ? MARY No , a man ! NUNS ( Singing . ) VIRGO SINGULARISINTER OMNES MITIS , NOS CULPIS SOLUTOS MITES FAC ET CASTOS . ABRAHAM Why could n't you trust me ? MARY Oh ! ABRAHAM If you 'd told me , I would have prayed for you ! I would have done penance for you ! MARY Oh , stop ! ABRAHAM No one but Christ lived without sin ! We all sin ! We fall ! But we can repent , and rise again ! Mary ? p. 11 MARY Go away ! ABRAHAM I love you ! MARY NO ! ! ! ABRAHAM What else but love could make me leave my cell , and break my vows ? What else but love could make me , a hermit of God , come to this dreadful place and act like a lascivious fool ! Mary , look at me ! NUNS ( Singing . ) VITAM PRAESTA PURAMITER PARA TUTUM , UT VIDENTES JESUMSEMPER COLLAETEMUR . MARY I ca n't ! ABRAHAM ( Arms outspread . ) Come back to me ! Ask God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me ! Anything ! I 've been a dead man without you ! NUNS ( Singing . ) SIT LAUS DEO PATRISUMMO CHRISTO DECUS , SPIRITUI SANCTOTRIBUS HONOR TUUS.Amen . ( Pause . Mary slowly raises her head and looks at him . ) MARY I ca n't say no to you . I ca n't disobey you , or hurt you . ( She goes to him on her knees , and sets her forehead against his chest . ) ABRAHAM Mary ! MARY I will come back to you ! I want to ! p. 12 ABRAHAM I can see the window of your cell . That blessed place , where I come to see you every day . You smile at me and listen to me . MARY I pray and sing ! HROSVITHA She will do it all again !

MARY Amen ! ABRAHAM Amen ! ( Abraham takes his cross and exits . Mary exits . The lights change again , back to what they were when Hrosvitha began her story . ) HROSVITHA That is the end of my play . There will be music and the Sisters playing the parts will leave the stage . ( She steps back . Pause . ) GERBERGA So . Brother William ? ( No response . ) I will confess , this does bother me . Our Sister 's devotional poems are very clear . This is not clear . ( Pause . Gerberga stands , goes to Brother William . ) A sinner , Mary , is returned to God . But how ? Under the persuasion of a holy man who is a father to her , but who certainly does , in his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks at Brother William , who does not respond . She walks back to her chair again . ) This little play , if examined closely , might really imply that women , holy ones anyway , are seduced into their sanctity , and their convents , by men . It is only a small step further to suggest that we are all seduced , and not just by hermits , either , but by God , the greatest of Fathers . By Jesus , our bridegroom , to whom we think we give our lives . Yes , I can see why the Bishop would be upset . ( No response . ) Brother William ? ( No response . ) Are you asleep , sir ? p. 13 BROTHER WILLIAM I am not asleep ! ( He throws back his cowl , revealing his face . He is a very young man . In surprise , Gerberga sits again ) I have looked and I have listened . And I too am upset . Not about the play ! The play is hysterical female nonsense . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO RIDICULOUS ! What is n't ridiculous , and what I do care about , Gerberga of Gandershiem , is that music ! GERBERGA Music ? HROSVITHA Ave Maria ? BROTHER WILLIAM Yes , Ave Maria ! A hymn to the Virgin , composed by you ! Which you will sing not only here , but in churches outside your convent walls , in festivals and parades , in public worship ! That is why I am here ! GERBERGA Brother William , do not speak to me like this . BROTHER WILLIAM We know what you 're doing ! GERBERGA Brother William , I beg you . BROTHER WILLIAM This is a sin of pride ! Secure in a wealthy convent of Canoness nuns , you think you are a law unto yourselves ! Well , you are not ! GERBERGA Do not speak to me like this ! BROTHER WILLIAM I will speak to you as I please ! Your Bishop is deeply offended , and by you ! p. 14 GERBERGA And I , by him ! He sends me a boy ! An ignorant absurd little monk-boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Gandershiem is a free Abbey , given to me by my King and my Pope ! Who do you think you are talking to ? ( Brother William stands . ) BROTHER WILLIAM To a fool ! GERBERGA Me , a fool ? WHY ? BROTHER WILLIAM That music ! GERBERGA What about that music ? BROTHER WILLIAM It is blasphemous ! You compose chants ! You sing them yourselves ! You play on the cithara , the psalterium , the the harp and God save us , the trumpet ! Trumpets ! ! Women , tooting trumpets to the glory of God ! It is obscene and it is grotesque ! Scripture forbids it ! In the words of blessed Saint Paul : " Let the women keep silence in Church ! " GERBERGA Oh , you child ! You pompous , preposterous little self-important boy ! What do you think you are doing ? BROTHER WILLIAM Trying , oh Holy Woman , to warn you ! ( Gerberga stands . ) GERBERGA Of what ? I 'm not afraid of you , or your Bishop ! ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better be ! ( A step toward him. ) p. 15 GERBERGA Why ? Because we sing better here , write better here , LIVE better here , than you morose ugly men , with your eternal anger and hankering for revenge ? Please ! ! BROTHER WILLIAM You INSOLENT and INSUBORDINATE NUN ! Hear me and hear my Bishop ! These hotbed convents of arrogant women will no longer be tolerated ! My Bishop sends you by me an absolute command ! You will write no more Ave Marias ! You will parade yourselves in no more festivals and indulge yourselves in no more public displays ! GERBERGA Do you mean we can not sing outside the convent ? BROTHER WILLIAM I do ! GERBERGA We can not worship God in public ? BROTHER WILLIAM Exactly ! GERBERGA No ! ! ! ! Not to me ! ! ! You will do no such thing to me ! ! I WILL GO TO THE KING ! I WILL WRITE TO THE POPE ! ! BROTHER WILLIAM And they will STRIP you of your authority , DUMP ashes on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for MEN and BOYS , as God in His Holy Scripture plainly decrees ! WOMEN ! WE make the chants ! WE sing in Church ! It is OUR voices and not YOURS that will be heard in the vaults of heaven ! WOMEN ! ! ! BE SILENT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( Exit Brother William. ) p. 16 GERBERGA A mad monk . Really ! ( She turns to Hrosvitha. who is weeping . ) Oh , my dear . HROSVITHA What have I done ? I only wanted to write a simple little play , about love . How love brings us to God . ( Stricken , she moves away from Gerberga . ) But if my play says that we , in the convent , are seduced here by men  --  and they do it because  --  they are like  --  GERBERGA God the Father ? Jesus our bridegroom ? Who bury us here , til death ? Yes , your simple little play may say exactly that . HROSVITHA Then I must burn it ! I must never write anything ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . If we followed every decree of every Bishop , we would live like soldiers , not Sisters . You are Hrosvitha of Gandershiem , a Canoness Nun of worth and dignity . And while I am the younger woman , I am still your Mother Superior . So hear me . ( Hrosvitha turns to her obediently . ) You will continue your work ! You will write more plays ! ( Hrosvitha falls at her feet and kisses the hem of her robe . ) As for this one . It can never be performed . But it can be bound and put in the convent library . If the future ever wonders about us and what we did here , it will find your plays here . You are surely the first Sister to write anything like this . You may be the first woman to write plays , ever , and I may be the arrogant Nun who preserved them . I like that idea very much . ( Pause ) Of course , I do have a few suggestions . I know you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And some of that language is very harsh , could n't you smooth it out ? Why do n't you just call the play Abraham ? And that kissing . Well , I do n't know about all that kissing . ( Exit Gerberga . Hrosvitha sighs and follows her . Nuns sing Amen . In shadows again the rug and the chairs are removed . The rose window vanishes . The stage is bare . Spotlight. )
