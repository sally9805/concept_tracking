The Copyright Royalty Tribunal is one of those federal agencies headed by political appointees who accept obscurity in exchange for good pay : nearly $70,000 a year . The board , which sets royalty rates for commercial use of records and some TV programs , has often been a dumping ground for embarrassing job applicants . One such appointment surfaced last week . The tribunal 's new head , Marianne Mele Hall , 34 , appeared before a House subcommittee just after Broadcasting magazine had quoted parts of a book , Foundations of Sand , that she claimed to have co-authored . The book , written mainly by Lawrence Hafstad , a physicist and former vice president for research at General Motors , is filled with quirky racist observations . Many black men in U.S. ghettos " still hold to their African traditions , " it says . " They insist on preserving their jungle freedoms , their women , their avoidance of personal responsibility and their abhorrence of the work ethic . " Hall told the legislators she had not really co-authored the book , only " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you do n't need to understand what you 're reading . " An Administration official said that Hall was recommended by retired Lieut . General Daniel Graham , whose book on Star Wars she also helped edit . As for her future , another staffer mused that the question is not " should we get rid of her , but when and how . "
