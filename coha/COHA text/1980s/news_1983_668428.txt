The latest story making the rounds in political circles here about Frank Lazzaro Rizzo , the former mayor who is scheduled to announce tomorrow he ' ll make another run for City Hall , goes like this : When former city controller Thomas A. Leonard , one of Rizzo ' s opponents in the Democratic primary , said recently he thought the ex- mayor and police commissioner would be a " divisive " influence between blacks and whites if re- elected , a local radio reporter called Rizzo for reaction . " He talks about decisiveness ; let me just say to you I ' m not that , " Rizzo responded in a taped interview broadcast several times . " He ' s not going to fool whites or blacks with that . What did Frank Rizzo ever do that was decisive ? Nothing . " Actually , Rizzo prides himself on his leadership , though he ' s never claimed to be a student of the language . The malapropism appears likely to find its way into the cavalcade of Rizzo stories that already are local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as " the Cisco Kid " tries a comeback . Like the time : - In 1948 when he first made headlines as a policeman by singlehandedly breaking up a taxi robbery , sending all four holdupmen to the hospital . - When as police commissioner , his officers routed out a group of Black Panthers suspected of attacking policemen and forced them to strip naked in the street . No ties between the Panthers and the police assaults were ever found . - When as police commissioner he was photographed in a tuxedo , rushingfrom a formal affair to the scene of a civil disturbance with a nightstick jutting from his cummerbund. - Or the time in 1973 when , as mayor , he flunked a polygraph test on whether he had offered a bribe to Philadelphia ' s Democratic Party chief . Before taking the test , Rizzo had expressed " great confidence " in the lie detector . " If this machine said a man lied , he lied . " His comment on learning he had failed the test : " This examination is not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that Rizzo is back in the political hunt , there is said to be new interest in a book of his most memorable quotations published by the local chapter of Americans for Democratic Action entitled , " The Sayings of Chairman Frank/Or , I Never Saw My Mother Naked . " And his presence in the race is already attracting considerable national press attention . " The media is show business and I ' m good copy , " explained Rizzo matter-of- factly in an interview last week . " I understand that . . . . I walk down the street , I make the front page . People buy it . They used to put my name ( on tabloids* - RIZZO . And there ' d be nothing inside about me , but people bought it because Rizzo ' s name was on there . . . . Let me tell you , anything I do is big news . " While Rizzo , now 62 , has clearly lost none of his self- confidence , his strategy in 1983 is to be less strident and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds himself an underdog , and ironically , to a black man . Current polls show W. Wilson Goode , a sharecropper ' s son who recently resigned the city ' s No. 2 job of managing director to run for mayor , leading Rizzo by up to 15 percentage points . Though he has never held elected office , Goode , 44 , has won acclaim for the job he did as managing director . He also has stitched together unusually broad support among blacks , who make up nearly 40 percent of the city ' s population and 43 percent of its registered Democrats , as well as among a cross-section of Philadelphia ' s business and liberal establishments . Thus Rizzo now notes that he doesn ' t " have to talk about ( crime* too much any more because people know where I stand on crime . . . . I ' m a pretty conservative fella , but when it comes to human rights , I ' m a liberal . A stoned-out liberal . " Rizzo ' s curious equation of liberalism with the psychedelic-era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Civil Liberties Union , but his advisers are hoping that sort of rhetoric will get him some mileage among the upwardly mobile , white middle-class voters of northeast Philadelphia - the swing constituency that will decide May ' s Democratic primary , according to most experts . " Wilson Goode doesn ' t have to persuade black voters and liberal whites to vote for him , " says Philadelphia political operative and consultant Neil Oxman . " He just has to pull them to the polls . Frank Rizzo doesn ' t have to persuade many of the white ethnics . He just has to pull them . This election is for the white moderates . " That group , most of whom voted for Rizzo in 1971 and again in ' 75 - but against him in ' 78 when he tried unsuccessfully to amend the city charter to run for a third consecutive term as mayor - will likely have to be convinced there ' s a " New Rizzo " before they vote for him again . To that end , the Rizzo camp has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crafting of a new , mellower , more sensitive image . " I think Rizzo wants there to be a new Rizzo , " said David Glancey , head of the Philadelphia Democratic organization . " There ' s going to be a lot of hype about it on the tube , that ' s for sure . But my sense is that at 62 years old , you don ' t change much . I think he has changed the way George Wallace has changed : not necessarily internally , but since the times have changed , they realize they have to . " Today , Rizzo takes considerable umbrage at those who would picture him as a hip-shooting cop , or latter-day fascist . He slapped an $11-million libel suit against a Philadelphia weekly for comparing him to Hitler and Mussolini last year . And he has even staked out a claim as an environmentalist by filing another lawsuit against a number of chemical companies , claiming that insecticides sprayed on his front lawn caused his dog to become seriously ill . But what clearly grates most at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a racist . " That ' s the part that upsets me , " he said . " I ' m not a racist . I was a cop . What ' s a cop ? A peacemaker . I ' m proud of what I did as a policeman . . . . One of the things I really want to do is prove I ' m the mayor of all the people.Because they painted me in a certain way and were very cruel about it . " Despite such baggage , Rizzo notes that he still has no problem raising money , claiming $750,000 to date - without formally announcing . Indeed , political operatives here were surprised when lawyer Howard Gittis and real estate executive William Batoff , two leading local fundraisers who had been loyal to liberal Mayor William J. Green 3d , signed on with Rizzo when Green annouced he would not seek a second term . Rizzo , who stands 6 feet 2 inches tall , weighs 240 pounds and wears custom-made shirts with 20-inch collars , still speaks of Philadelphia as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cigar in hand , he makes a sweeping motion with his arm and takes broad credit for much of the new construction downtown , either recently completed or still in progress . He ticked off what he said were key accomplishments of his eight years in City Hall : the building of a new commuter tunnel , 10 new hotels , 15 new hospitals , a new community college , 15,000 units of housing . He promises more of the same if he is re-elected , saying that " the issue of the ' 80s is jobs , jobs , jobs . " He called the city " rudderless " now . Besides the social issues , like race and divisiveness , which inevitably will crop up during a Rizzo campaign , his opponents will likely question his record as a builder , as well . During the Rizzo years , the population of the city declined 13 percent and there was a loss of about 140,000 manufacturing jobs . Another likely issue : patronage , and the way Rizzo used it as mayor . He replies : " Patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . There ' s a group of people in this city . . . who can ' t pass these ( **26;101;TOOLONG . They are hard-working people that need jobs . Sure it ' s a political system , but I didn ' t deal and wheel in that political system . The only people that I ever hired in patronage were poor people who needed jobs . I ' d put ' em in the streets department . " When all is said and done , Rizzo still likes to talk of ethnicity and remind an interviewer from whence he came : Italian South Philadelphia , where , according to one civic leader , he still attracts the same sort of adoration the Pope might . " My father was born in Italy , " said Rizzo . " My mother was born in this country . I ' m the first Italo-American ever to reach the rank of police inspector , which is a high rank in this town . I ' m the first Italo-American ever to reach the rank of deputy commissioner . The first Italo-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become mayor . And I ' m proud of that . Proud because a lot of other ethnics helped me get to that high spot . I know I love Philadelphia . . . . " People talk about the New Rizzo . ' There ' s no new Rizzo . There ' s a wiser Rizzo . I made some mistakes . Most of the mistakes hurt me personally , not the city I was sworn to protect as a policeman and as a mayor . Wiser . You learn with the job . . . . A guy that don ' t make mistakes , don ' t do anything . " For all the New Rizzo talk , most political professionals here doubt the former mayor can win re-election . They argue that his white ethnic base is smaller than Goode ' s base of blacks and white liberals , and that the white moderate swing constituency is more likely to be swayed by Goode than Rizzo - a man with a 100 percent name recognition quotient about whom most people already have strong feelings . Rizzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back as mayor the day I left , " he said , " because I knew the people that were running , and I knew who won , and , no disrespect , I knew that this town needed Frank Rizzo . . . . " I ' m gon na win it . Some of my opponents have strength in some areas . But I have the great numbers , the majority . I ' m gon na do well in almost every part of this town . I know it . I can feel it . I can see it . . . . You can ' t beat me . No way . "
