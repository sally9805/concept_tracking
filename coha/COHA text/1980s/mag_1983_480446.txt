deal , he will have a grandfather in jail as well . For the last decade , the major industry in Steinhatchee , and other coastal communities in Florida , has been the moving and storage of marijuana . That industry is now relocating , we hear , to places like Georgia , New England , and Texas . Steinhatchee was one of the first places to be identified with the marijuana trade , and now it is one of the first places to experience the consequences fully . STEENHATCHEE , " as it is pronounced , does not resemble Florida as the regular tourist knows it . A small , conservative coastal community with a strong Baptist church , it has no condominiums or time-share units or associations of retired Ohioans , though there is a fishermen 's organization , now inactive because one third of its members are in custody . These days , the people are as obsessed with legalisms as they once were obsessed with tidal fluctuations along the Steinhatchee River , which enters the Gulf of Mexico in the northwestern part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On either side of the Steinhatchee , and connected by a one-lane wooden bridge , are Taylor County and Dixie County , the distinction between them important to citizens who needed to know , from day to day , which county 's deputy sheriffs had been bribed . The river has the look of the bayou scenes on the covers of ragtime piano sheet music . Stands of reeds and tall grasses obscure its banks , and higher up on the shoreline the trees are dense and burdened with Spanish moss . The scenery does not attract vacationers . " Are you fishing , or just passing through ? " the sign asks , thus presenting the only two understandable alternatives . Steinhatchee 's repeat visitors are the weekend bushwhacker types from Atlanta , who wear camouflage shirts and pants , presumably to blend in with the surroundings , and who ride the river in bass boats that look like sequined fingernails . The town consists of a few cabins , trailers , and fish houses built along both banks of the river . Full-time residents of Steinhatchee and the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry one of the neighbors , and then occupy a cabin or trailer along the river . After three generations of this , the inhabitants are interrelated in a variety of ways . Most can not imagine living elsewhere . Did n't Thurman Corbin leave on a two-week elk-hunting trip to Montana and then return to the river two days later , homesick ? " You can have them mountains . " Until recently , Corbin worked for Georgia-Pacific , one of the companies that own the pine forest surrounding Steinhatchee on the land side and that have unwittingly provided a hiding place for baled marijuana . The men who do n't work for timber companies are commercial fishermen who catch mullet and trout from shallow , beamy skiffscalled bird-dog boats . These boats have traditionally been described as " about twenty feet long , " but recently they have come to be known as " not much bigger than a jury box . " Steinhatchee people have always believed that rural life makes better neighbors and more loyal friends than urban life , and that neighborliness is more valuable than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful for local residents to sit at these trials and listen to the testimony of C. M. Stewart , who got himself wired up by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement . Everybody claims to have been flabbergasted that C. M. would do such a thing ? maybe a Cuban would do it , but C. M. Stewart is a Steinhatchee boy , and he grew up cleaning mullet on the edge of the river . I N THE previous generation , there were five Stewart brothers , and all of them built boats , worked on boats , or owned fish houses . In the current generation , we find Nevin Stewart . Jr. , a pilot and fish spotter who helped locate and capture dolphins for the navy and for Marineland , who was captured himself in Cross City with a planeload of marijuana and is now in prison . Danny Stewart was arrested in one of the numerous deals , skipped bail , and either died or did not die in the crash of a small plane in Texas , depending on whom you talk to . E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections in Colombia , until they had to sneak out of the back of a convenience store near Steinhatchee to avoid arrest in the Double-Wide deal . They are still fugitives . Tom Stewart , who was the captain of a shrimp boat . has pleaded guilty and may receive immunity for his own crimes . Then there is C. M. Compared with Thurman Corbin , who came back early from that elk-hunting trip , the Stewarts are well traveled , C. M. Stewart , for instance , spent twenty years in the navy and was scheduled for retirement in 1978 . It was on the family 's reunion cruise to Nassau in 1977 that C. M. noticed that his cousin E. J. and his other cousin , Nevin Jr. , never lacked money for liquor or for the slot machines . C. M. later said , " That 's when I asked E. J. ? I said , Hey , look , what do I have to do ? ' " A year later , C. M. moved back to Steinhatchee and took over Duke 's and Webb 's fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edge of the river . C. M. was buying the business from the Webb family . His wife , Sandra , was a Webb , niece of S. B. Webb , a ponderous and likable old fisherman with a bird-dog boat . C. M. did n't intend to do much fishing himself ; he was moving into the pot business . After two eventful years , C. M. was still to be found on one of the plastic chairs , fused into a permanent semicircle , that must have once belonged to a bowling alley . C. M. was drinking bourbon and telling stories . Nobody suspetted that then he was taping stories as well . C. M. Stewart has not visited Steinhatchee since the mass arrests of 1981 , and the local rumor was that he could not live with his own treachery and had plucked out his eyes , a redneck Oedipus . The rumor was dispelled when C. M. appeared as a prosecution witness at the trial on the Double-Wide Trailer deal , held in Gainesville in October 1982 . He is short and trim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . His shoes were well polished and all his parts seemed to be intact , especially his eyes . He had no trouble identifying S. B. Webb , from over at the fish house ; and S. B. Webb 's son , Buddy ; Thurman and Willard Corbin ; Gary Ellison and Carl Ellison , who run Ellison 's fish house ; Colin Kelly ; Duane Levingston , whose mother and C. M. 's wife are sisters ; and Leonard Stewart , C. M. 's own cousin . All of these men , C. M. Stewart said , were part of the crew that unloaded the shrimp boat and put the bales in a double-wide trailer just outside of town back in 1979 . The women in the audience , some of them also related to C. M. , behaved admirably , except on one occasion when they chortled and hissed like a Greek chorus and had to be told by the judge that they could be jailed for contempt . The defense lawyers had asked the jury not to convict C. M. 's subordinates , since C. M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury convicted them anyway . T HE town did not seek out the business that has brought it such misfortune . Marijuana came to Steinhatchee . The first time any of the local fishermen saw a bale , or even a stalk , was after one of Floyd Bubba Capo 's boats ran aground on a shoal in nearby Rocky Creek in 1973 . J. Bryant Lytle saw the bales from his own boat . " T did n't know what the shit it was , " he said . " I thought it was some kind of bayonet trees from over on Pepperfish Island . " ( Lytle himself went to jail for the Watermelon Truck Stop deal . ) Another fisherman took a sample from one of the bales over to the sheriff 's department , where then deputy Glen Dyals , now the head sheriff and under considerable suspicion himself , suggested that he thought it was marijuana and his department could take some credit for the nine-ton bust , the biggest in U.S. history up to then . The case was taken over by the Florida Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons that will soon be apparent . Those arrested in the bust were called the Steinhatchee Seven , a prophetic misnomer . Six of them were middle-class kids from St. Petersburg , and the seventh was Capo , who lived down at Horseshoe Beach , fifteen miles away . In 1973 , most of the regular Steinhatchee fishermen bristled at the headlines that connected them with drug smugglers , just because a boat happened to end up in one of their creeks . By 1976 , Capo had returned from prison , and all that had changed . Capo was the fisherman everybody wanted to emulate . As his business flourished , he donated money for crippled children , needy families , and civic organizations , and he even built his wife a church near Horseshoe Beach . Three county commissioners were willing to testify to his excellent character , including one who said that if Capo were put away again , " I can see it being a lick economically for Dixie County . " Other fishermen might not have imitated Capo if they had known he would be sentenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife would run off with the minister of the church he built , and that the IRS would attach the church for nonpayment of back taxes . But at the time , they were oblivious to the risks . Before the grounding of Capo 's boat , there had been no drug culture in rural Dixie County , Most of the men who became smugglers were not marijuana smokers . In fact , about the last people you would expect to see with joints in their mouths except for DAR ladies and Republican hopefuls ? would be the fishermen of Steinhatchee . " Pot hauling , " they called their new business . It could equally well have been seaweed or limestone they were hauling , as long as the payoff was $10,000 a night and up . As for the teenagers , their biggest problem was a tendency to drive trucks at very high speeds into trees and get killed . ( Thurman Corbin lost a son that way . ) They might have been among the last Americans in their age group to try marijuana , if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or post that they adopt has to come through Atlanta and then Gainesville and then Cross City before it reaches the river . But by the late 1970s , clumps , twigs , or even bales of marijuana could be found abandoned in the woods or along the river . The youth of Steinhatchee could gather it the way children of industrial England collected forgotten bits of coal to bring home to the family furnaces . Their parents , the pot haulers , got empirical evidence that marijuana was not harmful by watching their offspring smoke joints from the bale droppings . The fishermen did not participate in suburban medical debates between teachers and doctors about the hazards of the drug ; they believed what they could see with their own eyes , and that was that pot was n't half as bad as liquor . The drug they really detested was Quaaludes . Apparently , the young people in Steinhatchee lost their interest in orthodox employment not because they had smoked too much marijuana but because they understood its profitability , which made fishing for $10,000 a year a dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents . who , like the bushwhackers from Georgia , were doing it for pleasure and not out of necessity . It was easier to buy marijuana in Steinhatchee than to buy fish . As the town 's new industry became established the regular fees for smuggling reached $10,000 r night for each bale handler ; $20,000 for the deputy sheriffs , county officials , and truckers ; $50,00 for offload crew organizers and supernumeraries ; as much as $500,000 for the executive managers o : the load . The gross town product for a single year of marijuana importing had to be greater than the gross town product for a decade of mullet fishing . Most of the money went for imprudent invest ? ments in future marijuana loads or for celebratory cocaine ? but most pot haulers continued to prefer whiskey , if they drank at all . SIN  --  ? 4 TEHATCHEE 'S burgeoning new trade was left 1 undisturbed by the law . There were local people who opposed the smuggling , but they found themselves in the same position as marijuana advocates in other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local officials . So they kept their views to themselves . The nearest office of the DEA was more than two and a half hours away , and besides , those people had their hands full with the large-scale mayhem in southern Florida . At the local level , the county 's elected officials the school hoard members , county commis-sioners , and sheriffs ? come from the ranks of fishermen and heavy-equipment operators , and they are all distantly or directly related . As a result , the machinery of justice moves in eccentric ways . It always has in communities like this one . In the late 1960s , for example , after the high school at Cross City burned down , members of the school board were suspected of having authorized the burning to collect insurance money . School hoard officials were also accused of disposing of the salvage for their own benefit , and one of them , Gene Van Aernam , was charged with larceny for billing the county for federal hurricane disaster relief work that was never done . When a ' state 's attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to disband itself rather than take a position , the county commissioners took the Fifth Amendment , and the governor of Florida threatened to send in private investigators from the Wackenhut Corporation to straighten out Dixie County . Circuit court judge Sam Smith refused a prosecution request to move the Van Aernam trial elsewhere , and then promptly dismissed the case . A decade later , both defendant and judge would be sent to prison on drug charges . Then there was the Osteen affair . Tommy ( ) steer ' was charged with killing a deputy sheriff after the sheriff tried to arrest Osteen for being drunk . Until early 1980 , juries in both Taylor and Dixie counties were chosen from master lists drawn up by members of the county commissions . When Tommy Osteen 's case was heard , in 1968 , his brother , Ed Osteen , was on the Dixie County Commission . Tommy was acquitted . There were no major drug convictions in Dixie and Taylor counties before 1979 , when the state and federal authorities finally got interested . Once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somber sheriff , usually Glen Dyals of Dixie County , posing in front of a marijuana plant that had been pulled up from somebody 's yard or examining a Baggie of marijuana that had been turned in by a conscientious high school student . Minor transgressors were vigorously prosecuted . James Williams , a black man , was found guilty of selling ten grams of marijuana for $25 and was sentenced to five years in prison . The judge in that case remarked that a person who peddles small amounts is , in a way , worse than someone who hauls it by the ton . As if to confirm his judgment , five days before Williams was incarcerated , four men were arrested by the state police at the Dixie County airport , preparing to unload 2,000 pounds worth , and they were allowed to plead nob in return for a fine of 520,000 each plus probation . D DOE COUNTY had n't convicted anybody important during the whole era of drug smuggling until 1981 , when Ronald Mishmash and three friends were stopped while driving out of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Kansas , while his three friends are also from the Midwest , The big names are first mentioned on tapes . There are tapes of Floyd Bubba Capo bragging that he could bribe Sheriff Dyals of Dixie ; and tapes of a smuggler who said Sheriff Von Whiddon of Taylor was paid $20,000 per load that came through ; and tapes of a Cuban who said he controlled Sheriff Grady Murphy , Von Whiddon 's successor who campaigned on a " clean up drugs " platform ; and tapes of ex-school board member Gene Van Aernam planning an importation with Frank Russell , the head of the Taylor County Commission ; and tapes of C. M. Stewart himself , saying that some Osteens are in the cocaine business . And we know that two of the Osteens ran around to various juries giving character references for Capo after his second arrest , and that the Dixie County Commission twice leased its own airport to known smugglers , and that its first public works priority was the building of a road that leads nowhere and has no function except as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a large newspaper was Lucy Morgan of the St. Petersburg Times . The big city newspapers do not care about circulation in Taylor and Dixie counties , and so until Morgan undertook her dogged investigation , press coverage up there was limited to the Dixie County Advocate . In his first week on the job , that paper 's editor wrote about litter , and then garbage was thrown all over his lawn . After his second editorial , about illegal hunting , a deer head was left on his 50 porch , and since then he has abolished editorials and concentrated on the positive stories . Over in Taylor County , the Taco Times publishes a great deal of recent marijuana news , while the Perry News Herald will inform the public when it has to , but will hardly ever editorialize against drug smuggling . In the August 31 , 1981 issue the lead article is about the indictment of the Taylor County commissioner and the second lead article is about another smuggler found guilty ; underneath that , there is news of the Van Aernam trial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , " is about the inefficiency of county garbage collectors . Meanwhile , the local sophisticates , including the Stewarts , could go to Colombia anytime they wanted and bring back a large shrimp boat full of several hundred bales , and the bird-dog boats would venture out to the shrimp boat and transfer the bales up the river and its tributaries to trucks parked on the banks . Marijuana and commercial fishing were the only two local businesses not controlled by outside corporate forces . Both were father-and-son efforts , both required similar skills and even similar hours ; but with marijuana you could work once a year . There was friendliness and neighborliness on the job . In fact , the small-town ethic still defined the smuggling . A person could be trusted with a bale . An organizer might well be armed , but he could be trusted to pay . There were no Cubans in the woods . As the loads gradually got larger , so did the potential profits , and boat builders began making huge bird-dogs whose only purpose was to hold more rectangular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's s -- 1 and Webb 's fish house in 1978 , pot hauling got more complicated . For one thing , there was a foreign element , referred to locally as " them Spanish-speaking jokers . " Suddenly there was cross-cultural interchange between Miami and the upper Gulf Coast . One resident said , " You saw them driving around and you knew why they were there . " The Cubans had been looking for new offload sites , away from south Florida where police pres-sure was being more strenuously applied . The Stein-hatchec people , meanwhile , had been finding the freelance gringo deal less and less viable . It was still possible for the Stewarts to go to Colombia in an empty shrimp boat and return with several hundred bales of marijuana , but with out-of-town buyers and sellers more heavily involved in all phases of the traffic , it was no longer easy . The Steinhatchee con-tingent sometimes worked as transportation and hauling specialists for the Cubans , and vice versa , and the Cubans enjoyed the isolation of the river and its tributaries . The former fishermen made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business connections ; they even had a distaste for Cubans . C. M. Stewart 's point of view , expressed frequently on the tapes , was that " Castro must not be a Cuban . He must have something else in him to be able ? to be able to think . " The Cuban point of view was that rednecks were untrustworthy and all looked alike . The two sides attempted to cross these cultural and linguistic barriers in various late-night negotiations , as shown in the following interchange between C. M. Stewart , Ira Reed , a Miami resident named Felix Miranda , and an unidentified Latin male . C. M. Stewart ; Well , who 's going to have it ? Where are we going to go to get it ? Felix Miranda : Que dice el ? Que dice it ? Ira Reed : You going to have the rest , Felix , at your house ? Miranda : Que dice el ? Ira Reed : Sure . Miranda : Quiere saber cuando van a consequir el resto del dinero . . Unidentified Latin : Felix will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unidentified Latin : And I believe Felix . C. M. : Does Felix believe the money will be there ? Unidentified Latin : Does he believe who ? C. M. : That the money will be there . Miranda : Que ? Que ? C. M. : Hey , what do they say ? A bird in the hand , it 's better than a bunch of them in the bushes ? Unidentified Latin : Que dice el ? Miranda : .. . qui un pdjaro en la marto es mejor ? The Steinhatchee fishermen began to feel that with these Cubans , a person could never be sure if he would get paid , and so they began to hide a few bales in the woods as a kind of product ransom . This bale snitching went by the respectable description of " collateral offload . " Then the load executives refused to send wages , on the assumption that the bales stolen from them would more than cover the payroll . The size of collateral offloads , therefore , grew in proportion to the mistrust between the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Steinhatchee were filled with numerous caches that had been held back from various people and with scavengers . At night , all of Stein-hatchee could listen for pickup trucks on the back roads and speculate about who was being cheated by whom . C M. STEWART entertained such speculation with Taylor County deputy sheriff Cooter Reed , who used to clean his own fish over at C. M. 's fish house and had no idea any of this would ever be overheard : Cooter Reed : Have you talked to Arthur lately ? C. M. : No . What happened with Arthur 's deal ? Cooter : He , he said that they had trouble getting through down yonder . Said they turned around and went back . Said , but .. . C. M. : Turned around and went back ? Cooter : . . . Said they were supposed to be here in two weeks . C. M. : Well , Arthur promised me I could help him . I ... there goes Mike Smutty Nose right there . He 's riding , too . Cooter : There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him ? Cooler : Tom right behind him . C. M. : Chasing Mike ? Cooter : Mike sold 105 pounds last night . C. M. : Where 's Mike getting all that dope ? Cooter : I do n't . . . C. M. : Off that airplane ? Cooler : . . . No , I do n't believe he got it off that airplane , because that was Charlie Brown 's plane . . . C. M. : Old Mike might still be selling some of that J. Bryant stuff . Cooter : 1 figure it is . They 're supposed to get some more tonight . C. M. : What , from that stuff they ripped off from J. Bryant ? Cooter : No . That you , that you all unloaded over yonder . . C. M. : That stuff that went to Tennille 's ? ... Cooter : Yeah . I heard Dudley had ripped him off a bale of that stuff .. C. M. : Well , now I believe , I honestly believe that the first deal Arthur was talking there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Now . . if Carl 's got another deal going , what he 's talking is that Ed Wood 's load . The collateral offload helped create an atmosphere of rancor and uncertainty that led to informing . The earliest informant was a Cuban named Jesus Perez , known locally as That-son-of-a-bitchJesus who came from Hialeah . Some of Perez 's Cuban friends had been arrested in the Suwannee River deal , an accidental bust by a marine patrol officer . Perez wanted to help his friends , and he was also mad that so much marijuana was being lost to collateral offloads from Cubans to gringos . He even suspected that local deputy sheriffs were turning their blue lights on the Cuban trucks to scare off the drivers so that more marijuana could be stolen . Therefore he agreed to cooperate with authorities . T HAT 'S HOW Gene Van Aernam , former school board member , and Frank Russell , then chairman of the Taylor County Com- mission , got into trouble . Perez taped them in the Suwannee Gables motel one night just after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish-speaking jokers went free , Van Aernam and Russell were sent to jail . A dozen citizens even picketed the courthouse to protest this injustice . This brings us back to the matter of C. M. Stew-art 's informing . It did n't simply come from a black 52 sump in his psyche ; it came also from the new ambience in Steinhatchee . Loads were out of control , with so many new connections and all the collateralizing , and federal and state investigators , capitalizing on the lack of solidarity , had begun to infiltrate . The Double-Wide Trailer deal , the beginning of some of the fishermen 's current troubles , was first busted in 1979 . The deal was a mess . Somehow , sixty to 100 bales never made it from the shrimp boat to the trailer ; the remaining bales were confiscated by state police ; the transporters were arrested and one of them implicated C. M. Stewart , who was arrested himself in 1980 and who agreed to turn in everybody else with the exception of his brother to save his skin . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the time ( which he admitted to in court ) when he could n't resist collateralizing a few bales of marijuana from a load that had got stuck on a clans bank and was eventually confiscated by the government . 0 LIKE 'S AND WEBB 'S fish house closed down . It now has new owners . The fishermen have reverted to catching fish , at ten to forty cents a pound wholesale . Steinhatchee itself seems unimproved by its brief period of affluence . The same rental cabins , fish companies , outboard motor repair shops , one-room luncheonettes , and , with few exceptions , the same houses abut the river . Cooey 's motel and restaurant , with the goldfish pond , is the only construction that might be called elegant , and it was built prcmarijuana . The partially completed concrete replacement for the old wooden bridge is the only sign of recent material progress , and that is being put up by the state . Though , it is true , two banks have opened branch offices in Steinhatchee , for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the severe local recession caused by numerous commercial failures , like the Spring Warrior deal and the Watermelon Truck Stop deal . The townspeople are traditionally so poor that they could hardly have bought anything fancier than a bird-dog boat without drawing attention to their improved status . C. M. Stewart installed a swimming pool at his residence he needed it for the offload crews to wash the marijuana residue from their bodies before they went home ? but he had a navy pension , so nobody doubted that he could afford a pool . For most of C. M. 's associates , even the purchase of a vehicle ? a Chevrolet pickup truck or , worse than that , a double-wide trailer ? was indiscreet . Herbert Corbin had opinions about that , even though he did not mean them to be on the record . C. M. : He sold some of it because he bought a new truck . Corbin : Yeah.C . M. : And I imagine he paid cash for that sonof-a-bitch . I do n't know . Corbin : That seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Howard Reed bought him a double-wide trailer . Big double-wide . Corbin : Yeah . Well , he sold his , too , then , did n't he ? C. M. : And Dudley bought him a brand-new Chevrolet truck . Corbin : I do n't know what makes them guys do that shit .... C. M. : Pure stupid . And , you know , Howard , he ai n't had a job in two years , a public job that I know of . Well , he worked for the county a little bit , a while back , but you ca n't get a trailer like that financed if you ca n't show some income of some kind . Corbin : Yeah . I know . C. M. : So he had to pay most of that in cash . Corbin : That 's right . Shit . C.

But there were six attorneys representing the various defendants in the recent trial and town inhabitants may have spent more than $250,000 on the two eases in which C. M. has testified , not to mention several others . The people 01 the town seem to have been the conduits in a gian . transfer payment between the marijuana smokers a : this country and the Florida bar . A FEW PEOPLE have been honest enough to admit to the IRS that they made unusually large incomes in certain years , and they put it down as " hauling . " The IRS has visited some double-wides . Thurman Corbin has been asked some pointed questions . Corbin is reputed to be the best tree-marker in the woods , and he can see a deer in one spot and tell you exactly where it will emerge from the undergrowth at another spot two or three miles away . Even with this level of skill , a tree-marker gets only 512,000 a year from Georgia-Pacific . So how about the $175,000 that Corbin invested in cattle , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like when 1 go home at night , I throw my change in the glass-jar type of thing and it accumulates over the years , " Corbin said to the grand jury . And then there were special times when " I 'd be out there busting fence posts at one o'clock in the morning . " And one very special time when Corbin made a clever speculation in wild hogs , because all the regular hogs had cholera . Steinhatchee residents insist that their biggest problem now is paying off the legal fees , but it may be harder to get the young people to forget the last decade and go back to fishing .
