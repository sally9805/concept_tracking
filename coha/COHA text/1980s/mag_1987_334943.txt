He remembers it this way . Outside San Salvador , 30 or 40 miles up in the hills , mortars began to hit the village , and bombs cratered the hillside . Run . <P> That was his first thought . And this was the second : Where ? It was open all around . The ground shook . The farmers looked at the traveler from Ireland and smiled and pointed . They tried to be reassuring . " That is over there , " they said . " We are over here . " <P> " I felt , " says the traveler , thinking back in a safer place , " such a fool in the face of it . Those guys lived with it all their lives , and it meant nothing to them . But the fear I felt that day . . . " Just talking could n't say it all . It would take a song . <P> When Bono tears loose on U2 's Bullet the Blue Sky , you can still hear the ache of fear in his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passionate , a cry of conscience on an album full of oblique social speculation and spiritual voyaging . The Joshua Tree is not , it would seem at first , a record for these times . Bono and the rest of the Irish band called U2 seem to be citizens of some alternative time frame spliced from the idealism of the ' 60s and the musical free-for-all of the late ' 70s . Their songs have the phantom soul of the Band , the Celtic wonderment of their compatriot Van Morrison and some of the assertiveness of punk , refined into lyrical morality plays . <P> Their concerts are as revivifying as anything in rock , with a strong undertow of something not often found this side of Bruce Springsteen : moral passion . U2 's songs speak equally to the Selma of two decades ago and the Nicaragua of tomorrow . They are about spiritual search , and conscience and commitment , and it follows that some of the band 's most memorable performances  --  and , not incidentally , the ones that have helped U2 break through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a good cause , at Live Aid or during last summer 's tour for Amnesty International . This is not , then , just a band for partying down . " Partying is a disguise , is n't it ? " Bono asks , and does not wait for an answer . This is a band that believes rock music has moral imperatives and social responsibilities . There is no one better than U2 at bringing " over there " back " over here , " and setting it down right by the front door , where no one can miss it . <P> U2 's sixth and best album , The Joshua Tree , in stores for little more than a month , hit No. 1 on Billboard 's chart this week . The album 's first single , With or Without You , has made the band 's heaviest mark on Top 40 radio and is already in the Top Ten . Other tunes on The Joshua Tree ( the title was inspired by a California desert town where ' 70s Rocker Gram Parsons died ) are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world tour in Arizona just three weeks ago , will play the U.S. through mid-May , perform in Europe most of the summer , then return to the States in September . " I guarantee you that when U2 comes back this record will be bigger than ever , " says Andy Denemark , a director of programming at NBC Radio . " There 's a lot of depth to this album .
