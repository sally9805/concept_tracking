With much of Beirut a combat zone last week , there was scarcely a place in the city that did not seem to be smack in the center of the action . " People broke into tears out of sheer nervous exhaustion , " reported Middle East Bureau Chief William Stewart after one particularly harrowing day of bombardment . So widespread was the destruction in mostly Muslim West Beirut , where TIME 'S offices are situated , that Beirut Correspondent Roberto Suro was dispatched across the Green Line , which divides the city , so that he could begin operating from the predominantly Christian east side . " In effect we set up a satellite bureau , " he says . " If a sudden and devastating attack on West Beirut began , we feared correspondents there might be pinned down or cut off , in which case I would try to cover the battle . " As the Israeli bombing and shelling increased and electricity and water supplies faltered , TIME 'S Abu Said Abu Rish moved the bureau 's office to the Commodore Hotel , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hundreds of encamped journalists . <P> Though the Israeli bombardment abated as the week went on , moving around the city or out into the hills to cover the fighting remained extremely hazardous . But it was possible . Cairo Bureau Chief Robert C. Wurmstedt , sent into Beirut two weeks ago , found that " you can still travel by taxi , but charges jump from $22 to as much as $200 for a nine-mile ride , depending on how dangerous an area you want to go to . " Of course , the whereabouts of danger was unpredictable . On a quiet street , a small van blew up less than 50 yards ahead of Suro , sprinkling his car with glass and metal shards . What happened , he reports , was that " a Palestinian fighter attempting to remove a wounded comrade from the the van accidentally set off a grenade he was carrying . " <P> One novel experience for the bureau was reporting on a new occupying force-the Israelis , who had troops spotted all over the area . " When I was transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hardly expected to cover the activities of the Israeli army . " Even more startling , Stewart found the Israelis covering his activities . On his way to suburban Baabda , Stewart came upon an Israeli tank with an Israeli TV camera crew in tow . " They asked to interview me , and I agreed , " says Stewart . " So I gave my impression of the siege for Israeli TV only hours after the bombardment . "
