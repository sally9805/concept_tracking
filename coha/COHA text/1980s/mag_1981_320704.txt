Needed : a consistent foreign policy-and muscle When Americans look abroad they tend to see enemy territory . When they look ahead , they tend to see bad times and bad situations getting worse . The confidence and optimism that marked America a generation ago have given way to anger and apprehension often bordering on fear . In short , one of the most serious problems affecting U.S. foreign and defense policy these days is the national mood . <P> To some extent , the anxiety is understandable and justified . <P> America 's potential enemies-most significantly the Soviet Union-are stronger and bolder than ever before . America 's friendships , meanwhile , are increasingly strained , its alliances increasingly divided . The U.N . General Assembly and some other international forums are dominated by supposedly neutral nations that ritually criticize U.S. policies and reject U.S. sponsored initiatives . Pro-Western regimes in the Third World appear vulnerable to revolt and subversion . The U.S. , and to a far greater extent its allies in Western Europe and Japan , depend for their very survival as economic powers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth-the Arabian peninsula and the Persian Gulf . <P> Americans rejoiced in the Inauguration Day liberation of the 52 hostages from the U.S. embassy in Tehran . Nonetheless , Iran threatens to succeed Viet Nam as a symbol of American frustration and impotence . American diplomatic support and military backing could not prevent the fall of the Shah , who for decades seemed the paragon of a U.S. friend overseas . Then came the humiliation of the embassy seizure , the burning of American flags , the ritual chanting of " Death to the great satan ! " by mullah-led mobs . Recent years have spawned an array offerees seemingly inimical to American interests , ranging from the extortionist pricing policies of OPEC to xenophobic Islamic fundamentalism . Iran , in a peculiarly ugly way , has managed to represent both . <P> In its attempts to deal with a more hostile and dangerous world , the U.S. has found that the assumptions , ideals , doctrines and instrumentalities on which it relied for decades to protect and advance its interests no longer seem to work very well - if at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in frustration . Henry Kissinger 's attempt to negotiate " peace with honor " in Viet Nam produced neither peace for Indochina nor honor for the U.S. ( in part , because Congress blocked him on some key issues ) . The Camp David peace accords , one of President Jimmy Carter 's few foreign policy achievements , have foundered on Israel 's refusal to consider an agreement that would provide real autonomy for the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza . <P> The impression of impotence has been reinforced by evidence of military weakness . The U.S. is ill-prepared to fight a conventional war . It has not even demonstrated a capacity to conduct a successful rescue mission-as pictures of the burning helicopters and charred bodies at Desert One last April so shatteringly illustrated . Rhetoric about military preparedness has tended to accentuate the problems . By proclaiming the Carter Doctrine , which committed the U.S. to meet Soviet aggression in the Persian Gulf area with force if necessary , the former President unwittingly raised the question of whether the U.S. had the      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
