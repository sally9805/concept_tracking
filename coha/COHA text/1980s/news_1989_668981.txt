Daniel Barenboim does not require any crash course in how to be a good Chicago politician . In his first press conference Tuesday afternoon at Orchestra Hall since the Chicago Symphony last month named him to succeed Georg Solti as music director , the Israeli conductor came across as a serious , articulate musician with an idealistic mission to build new civic and cultural bridges in the city after September , 1991 , when he formally assumes his duties here . He praised the quality of the CSO , Lyric Opera , the Art Institute and various theaters and universities , suggesting that he would like to help bring about " a much greater degree of collaboration , planning and give-and-take " among these institutions . " I shall spare no effort to get everybody in this city who has anything to do with culture to feel that we are all in one boat , " said the 46-year-old conductor . " The cultural life of this city has to be an example , not only in the U.S. but internationally . I have certain ideas about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of that will or can apply to Chicago , I don ' t know . " When pressed further , Barenboim said it would be premature for him to consider occasional conducting appearances at the Lyric or Ravinia after 1991 , but he did not rule out the possibility . He firmly denied that the controversy surrounding his recent firing as artistic director of the Bastille Opera in Paris would in any way diminish his role here . In fact , he said he and the CSO management are exploring the possibility of bringing to Chicago three semistaged Mozart operas reclaimed from the wreckage of his Bastille agenda . " I can not agree ( the dispute ) was a battle of egos . There was a contract , and the contract was broken . The whole chapter is one of straight-out lies and bad faith . I am not considering any legal action-it ' s already in the hands of the lawyers .

However , he declined to say whether this meant that he and his wife , Elena , would now make Chicago their permanent home . " I suppose ( home will be ) on the stage , " he replied . Barenboim reserved his greatest praise for the Chicago Symphony musicians , whom he has known as colleagues for 20 years , saying that " my weaknesses are known to them and their strengths are known to me . " " That , I think , may augur well for the future . " Barenboim said that his respect for the orchestra increased after hearing them perform a concert under Solti last Saturday in New York ' s Carnegie Hall . " I had been wondering : What am I going to do with the Chicago Symphony ? ' After that wonderful concert I realized that I needn ' t waste my time .

His March concerts will include a concert performance of Wagner ' s " Parsifal " ( Act II ) and the premieres of works by Toru Takemitsu and Edison Denisov .
