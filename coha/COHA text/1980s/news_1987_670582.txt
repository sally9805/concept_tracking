Many members of Congress , arguing that United States forces are in real danger of further attack , have demanded that the President invoke this landmark legislation . Yet the Administration , citing both constitutional and substantive objections , has refused to take this step. // Besides maintaining that the law is unconstitutional , the White House apparently fears that the act ' s 90-day deadline - beyond which our forces could not remain in the region without explicit Congressional authorization - would encourage the Iranians to unleash an all-out war against American shipping in the gulf in the hope of inducing Congress not to grant this authorization. // Under the pressure of events in the gulf , the Senate has felt compelled to act . Unfortunately , it has adopted an approach which , however well intentioned , fails either to assert the relevance of the War Powers Resolution for the current situation in the gulf or to send a clear message of American resolve to both our friends and foes in the region. // Instead , the Byrd-Warner Resolution ( which the Senate passed last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hold another vote on an as yet undefined resolution . That resolution could do virtually anything , from declaring war to terminating the entire American presence in the gulf. // The Byrd-Warner approach constitutes a kind of tacit Congressional complicity in the President ' s refusal to invoke the War Powers Resolution . Moreover , it would actually create the very same period of uncertainty about American intentions that critics of the War Powers Resolution have lamented . In short , it has given us the worst of both worlds. // There can be little doubt but that the War Powers Resolution applies to the current situation in the gulf . Under the provisions of this 1973 statute , the President must report to the Congress within 48 hours when United States forces are deployed into hostilities or into situations " where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances . " These forces must then be withdrawn within 90 days unless Congress adopts a resolution authorizing our presence there. // In the past two months we have seen a succession of war-like incidents in the gulf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and United States forces have fired in retaliation against Iranian offshore platforms and mine-laying vessels. // Furthermore , the Pentagon ' s decision to award dangerous duty pay to military personnel serving in the gulf - because they are " more subject to hostile fire or imminent danger " - clearly undermines the Administration ' s contention that our troops are not in a situation covered by the War Powers Resolution . One can not help marveling at the logic of a position that awards dangerous duty pay yet denies that the situation prompting this pay has any connection with the War Powers Resolution. // Mr. Reagan should trigger the resolution , because it is the law of the land . While the President may believe the act is unconstitutional , as have all his predecessors since 1973 , he is nonetheless obligated to carry out its provisions until the courts rule on the issue. // Invoking the resolution is not only legally imperative , but also politically desirable . Then both houses of Congress would undoubtedly adopt , by substantial majorities , a resolution approving our military presence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of reflagging the Kuwaiti tankers would be reluctant at this point to order our fleet home. // Such a resolution would legalize and legitimize our policy of escorting American-flagged ships in the gulf . At the same time , it would demonstrate to our friends in the region that this is a commitment we intend to honor , while simultaneously sending a clear signal to Iran that it can not drive a wedge between Congress and the Administration by unprovoked attacks against United States shipping in the gulf. // If the Administration remains adamant in its refusal to invoke the War Powers Resolution , other means can be found to establish the relevance of the resolution , while also obtaining an expression of legislative support for our Persian Gulf policy . For example , the White House and Congressional leaders could agree that Congress would adopt a joint resolution triggering the War Powers Resolution , while simultaneously authorizing the presence of American forces in the gulf . Mr. Reagan could then sign the resolution while issuing a statement that his signature did not represent an admission of the law ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relevance of the War Powers Resolution for the current situation in the gulf , while the Administration would get its show of Congressional support without giving ground on the constitutional principle . In addition , the uncertainty associated with the 90-day waiting period would be avoided , depriving the Iranians of an incentive to attack American ships in the hope of inducing Congress to refrain from enacting a resolution approving the American presence in the Gulf. // There are , to be sure , some members of Congress who would like to invoke the War Powers Resolution , not in order to endorse our naval presence in the gulf but to terminate it . Whatever the merits of the original reflagging decision , however , it would be a serious mistake to change course now. // After the fall of the Shah , the withdrawal of the marines from Lebanon and Irangate - all of which cast doubt on the value of American promises and support - the decision to respond affirmatively to Kuwait ' s reflagging request has gone a long way toward shoring up the confidence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In a less important area of the world , our reputation as a steadfast supporter might not much matter . But in the Persian Gulf , home to 60 percent of the world ' s proven oil reserves , maintaining America ' s credibility must be regarded as a policy objective of the first order. // Opposition in the United States to the initial decision to reflag Kuwait ' s tankers arose in part from a perception that we were acting on behalf of friends and allies who would be the principal beneficiaries of our actions but who were unwilling to accept any of the burdens associated with United States policy . Yet now , after a somewhat sluggish start , we are receiving considerably more cooperation from our friends in the region than is generally realized . Most of the gulf states are not only supporting us diplomatically , but are also providing significant logistical assistance , including mine sweeping , radar coverage , port facilities and medical contingency arrangements. // Our European allies have also committed themselves to a much more visible presence in the region . Currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the British , French , Dutch , Belgians and Italians all providing vessels . Indeed , the French have a higher percentage of their fleet in the gulf than we do. // In short , in its basic outlines , American policy for the Persian Gulf is essentially on track . Now , having committed ourselves to a policy of reflagging and providing naval escorts , we must stay the course. // A decision to deflag the reflagged Kuwaiti tankers would have the most serious consequences for our credibility in the region and around the world . Were we to allow the fulminations of the fundamentalists in Teheran to force us out of the Persian Gulf , countries that depend upon us for their security would inevitably be led to reconsider the wisdom of relying on a United States defense commitment. // One of the lessons of the Vietnam War is the necessity of maintaining support at home if we are going to sustain our commitments abroad . Invoking the War Powers Resolution would significantly help to facilitate the emergence of a much-needed national consensus on our policy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
