( WEEBJOB IS IN HIS SQUASH PATCH WHEN HE HEARS A TRUCK . HE TURNS TO THE ROAD , BUT FINISHES DIGGING BEFORE HE WALKS TO THE HOUSE . ) It 's Pick Up . Mighty Warrior does n't bark . WILLINGDEER ( HE ENTERS . ) Ola , Weebjob . CHALK Ola , Pick Up . WILLINGDEER ( THERE 'S THE SOUND OF THE TRUCK DOOR SLAMMING . ) I 've returned with your daughter , Sweet Potato . CHALK My name is Suzanne ! ( SHE SITS ON THE STEPS OF THE HOUSE . ) WILLINGDEER I saw her on the road hitchhiking to Gallup . I told her I would bring her back to her father . ( SWEET POTATO SITS ON THE STEPS AND DOES N'T LOOK AT THEM . ) CHALK What have my days come to ? ( PAUSE . ) WILLINGDEER She did n't want to come .

CHALK And not a word of it got through . ( SHE SITS UP . ) CHALK ( LOOKING AT SWEET POTATO . ) You misunderstand . I was raised in a different culture  --  I have trouble understanding  --  come on , Sweet Potato . Dismount . Your mother is at her sister 's , not to return for a few days . I 'm hungry . See what 's in the kitchen and I will break my fast . CHALK Nothing 's in the kitchen if mother 's not here . ( IMPATIENTLY . ) You 're busy making philosophy to the pines and religion to the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the highway . You read the Book . And yet the garden grows nothing but squash vines . Not one word of your Book changes anything ! p. 4 WILLINGDEER I believe the child is bitter . CHALK ( IGNORING PICK UP . ) Sweet Potato , my daughter , tuber of my soul , see what 's in the kitchen for your starving father , Weebjob . I shall relinquish my fast . ( PAUSE . ) WILLINGDEER ( LOOKING AT WEEBJOB . ) She does not move . CHALK I see that she does not move !  --  You need not tell me , Job 's friend . She is stubborn and recalcitrant . WILLINGDEER You 're too kind with your words . CHALK I 'm grumpy as thunder . Like Mighty Warrior , my dog . Like my wife two weeks at her sister 's and nothing to eat .

No loaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Weebjob . I 've never heard you talk that way . CHALK I 'm at a crossroads in my life . p. 5 CHALK ( RISING FROM THE STEPS . ) Mutton . I 've heard that all my life . You 're always at a crossroad . WILLINGDEER You 've always lived by the words of the Book you 've committed to memory . CHALK I remember nothing . What memory ? I can remember nothing but war . CHALK ( ALMOST RESTS HER ARM AGAINST PICK UP , BUT DECIDES AGAINST IT . ) You 've never been in war . You were too young for one , too old for another . CHALK To get up in the morning is war . ( AS WEEBJOB MAKES THIS SPEECH TO THE HEAVENS , PICK UP BRUSHES SWEET POTATO 'S ARM . ) To wrestle with the day , and with my work , is war . To have three children with minds of their own is war .

( TURNS TENDERLY TO HIS DAUGHTER . ) I need you , Sweet Potato . p. 6 WILLINGDEER ( AGREES WITH WEEBJOB . ) Gallup is a long way . CHALK Three hundred miles . CHALK ( SHE WALKS BACK TO THE STEPS . STANDS THERE WITH HER HAND IN HER HIP POCKET . ) It 's because nothing happens here . You live in the fertile Salazar Canyon , the greenest in New Mexico . ( SHE RAISES HER ARMS . ) You could have sheep , but you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James makes you an irrigation ditch , but what do you grow ? ( SHE SLAPS HER HANDS AT HER SIDES . ) Nothing ! You put up signs where our road runs into the highway . You make more signs . They say , Canaan. Whatever that means . They say , The devil and I do not speak  --  ( SHE LOOKS AT WEEBJOB FIERCELY . ) Whatever that means . When I go in to Old Lincoln they ask at the general store if I 've come for more paint . ( PAUSE . ) Once in a while you sell gourds and squash at the roadside stand . You sell mother 's blankets in Old Lincoln when we 're desperate . What good ever comes from this ? ( SHE SHRUGS AS THOUGH GIVING UP , AND STANDS WITH HER HANDS ON HER HIPS AGAIN . ) CHALK Yes , I have nothing . I 'm proud to have nothing ! The prophets of the Book had nothing . It 's work to have nothing , Sweet Potato . I should have sent you to the Female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have these ideas  --  p. 7 CHALK ( UNDER HER BREATH . ) Shit . CHALK Then you would understand that I grow visions  --  CHALK ( WITH HER HANDS OVER HER EARS . ) Heaven above . This is your harvest ? I 've seen you sitting in your squash patch in some kind of trance . Holy God . You look like you 're talking to yourself . Is that the culmination of your life 's work ? CHALK I wo n't have irreverence on my land . Someday you 'll understand what Canaan means . For now , get me something to eat ! ( MORE DEFINITE NOW . ) CHALK I thought it was your meat to do the will of the Father . CHALK It is . And to finish the work I 've begun . The fields are white with harvest . This is what I 'll do until I hear my name called from beyond the mountains . CHALK Your fields and desert look brown to me . You interpret the Book to fit your purpose . CHALK Not so , Tuber . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm not appreciated . There may be things you do n't know . I have faith that the desert is white with harvest , and will blossom by faith . I have seen the Thunder Hawk , Sweet Potato , what else can I say to you ? ( SWEET POTATO WALKS RELUCTANTLY TOWARD THE HOUSE . THE MEN WATCH HER UNTIL SHE ENTERS THE FRONT DOOR. ) p. 8 WILLINGDEER You should beat your sword into a ploughshare and your pulpit into a tractor . CHALK I do n't ask your counsel . You know me , Pick Up . We 've been friends many years , though I do n't know why . You understand me  --  WILLINGDEER Not any longer , Weebjob . You ca n't expect your children to understand your ways . Your sons have already left . William to Roswell and James to Socorro . CHALK They come back from time to time . WILLINGDEER Your wife 's at her sister 's . CHALK ( DEFENSIVELY . ) Just for a visit . She returns soon .

You 're the one who believes in loaves and fishes . You go find something . I 'll have to go to town if you want supper . WILLINGDEER ( HE LOOKS UP THE ROAD . ) Another car comes . CHALK A stranger ? CHALK No , Mighty Warrior is quiet . CHALK So what does that mean ? He 's like you . He would n't bark if it were Custer . CHALK It 's James . LONG CHALK ( ENTERS . ) Suzanne ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO PICK UP , WHO SHAKES HIS HEAD THAT SHE 'S ALL RIGHT . ) Hersah did n't know where you 'd gone . CHALK She tried to make her run to Gallup again . WILLINGDEER Someday she 'll make it . Then we 'll have to drive three hundred miles to retrieve her . ( HE PAUSES , AS THOUGH TO HIMSELF. )  --  Probably in my truck . p. 10 CHALK James , my younger son . I have n't heard from you  --  LONG CHALK I 've been busy , Father . CHALK It 's been a long time . LONG CHALK My job with the highway department takes me far away . I ca n't always get back . Hersah and Suzanne keep house for me . CHALK He could have gone to college if you 'd let him apply for a loan . And I could have a wool store in Old Lincoln and sell mother 's blankets . WILLINGDEER That 's six hundred miles by the time we get back to Salazar Canyon from Gallup , Weebjob . I do n't think my truck will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHALK Yes . I think she 's more Sweet Potato 's friend than mine . CHALK I 'd like for you to call me Suzanne , James . You do when I 'm in Socorro . And I think Hersah would be more your friend if you spent more time with her . CHALK She lives with him , does n't she ? WILLINGDEER Call her Sweet Potato , James . I like to hear it . CHALK Take me to the grocery store in Old Lincoln , James , so I can get us supper . p. 11 WILLINGDEER I 'll take you , Sweet Potato , Suzanne . That way I 'll be sure you come back . CHALK If Weebjob would come and see the buildings they 've restored , and how they 've made it into a town where people can stop , he 'd be interested in something other than Canaan. The old brown buildings used to look at one another with blank faces . Now they 're painted . Honeysuckle climbs the hitching posts  --  WILLINGDEER ( ALMOST MAKING FUN OF SWEET POTATO . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mark . ( WEEBJOB SCRATCHES HIMSELF . ) CHALK They asked me about Mother the last time I was there . Weebjob , you could fence off a corner of your land and keep a few sheep and shear them for wool we could sell in Old Lincoln . WILLINGDEER They were all shepherds in the Book . CHALK I 've already considered that . CHALK And he wo n't do anything about it . LONG CHALK Let 's go to the grocery store . WILLINGDEER ( LOOKS ANXIOUSLY AT SWEET POTATO . ) I 'll take her ! Give me a push , James . p. 12 CHALK I 'll come back , Pick Up . You do n't need to worry that I 'll run away to Gallup tonight . The desert gets too cold . WILLINGDEER ( HE STILL LOOKS AT SWEET POTATO . ) I need to take my truck . I ca n't let it set too long in one place or it decides it wo n't move again . ( PICK UP AND SWEET POTATO EXIT . JAMES FOLLOWS . WEEBJOB CHUCKS A STICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HE HEARS PICK UP 'S TRUCK COUGH AND START UP . SOON JAMES RETURNS . ) CHALK I feel badly , James . LONG CHALK Why , Dad ? CHALK Sweet Potato told me that you wanted to go to college . LONG CHALK I 'm doing fine with the highway department . I 'm getting an education from the horticulturist just the same as if I were in school . And I 'm getting paid for it . CHALK When she said that , it made me think how I have stayed here and not helped any of you . LONG CHALK I like my job . Do n't worry about Sweet Potato . William has done all right too . Sweet Potato just gets down on everything . Did n't William finish law school ? p. 13 CHALK Yes , because his wife 's family helped him . LONG CHALK ( HE TAKES WEEBJOB 'S SHOULDERS IN HIS HANDS WITH CARE . ) We do what we must . CHALK What 's wrong with her ? LONG CHALK I do n't know . She ca n't find anything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND PUTS HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS . ) Weebjob , I could bring you some Spanish bayonet or agave for your garden . I could bring you some vegetables and show you how to care for them , and how to cultivate the squash you already have . Then you could harvest a crop to sell in Old Lincoln each year . CHALK I do n't know . LONG CHALK You 've done nothing with the land , Father . You do n't even have a fishing license . A driver 's license . CHALK I do n't need a license to fish in my own pond . LONG CHALK The land deed  --  your will  --  CHALK I could think I was talking to William . Has he put you up to this ? LONG CHALK ( SARCASTICALLY . ) No , Dad . I actually thought of it on my own . p. 14 CHALK I do n't seem to know all I need to know either . ( THE PUZZLED LOOK RETURNS TO HIS FACE . ) What 's going on in Socorro that you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LONG CHALK Am I supposed to know everything she 's thinking ? I 'm gone sometimes several days on highway department work . She and Hersah talk . Ask her . All I know is that I heard them fighting one night . CHALK The girls ? LONG CHALK No , Father . Pick Up and Sweet Potato . CHALK Pick Up comes to Socorro ? LONG CHALK You did n't know ? CHALK Did n't know what ? There 's nothing to know . LONG CHALK Pick Up comes to Socorro sometimes to see Sweet Potato . CHALK Pick Up goes to Socorro to see Sweet Potato ? He 's my friend , not hers ! He 's old enough to be her father . I expect you to be your sister 's keeper and you let something like that happen ! He 's almost as old as I am . The fool ! ( WEEBJOB GRABS JAMES ' SHIRT . ) Why is he bothering Sweet Potato ? LONG CHALK ( TAKES HIS FATHER 'S HANDS IN HIS OWN . ) I do n't think she minds it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAMES . WEEBJOB HITS HIS THIGHS IN ANGER . HE PICKS UP A STICK AND CHUCKS IT IN THE DITCH OFF STAGE . ) Chew it to bits , Mighty Warrior . ( HE LOOKS QUESTIONINGLY TO HEAVEN . ) WORSE than what I feared has come upon me . ( LOOKS TO JAMES . ) Why am I not told anything ? That old man bothering my daughter ! What 's wrong with him ? LONG CHALK ( INTERRUPTS HIS FATHER . ) I came for another reason also , Father . Now that I know Sweet Potato is here , I see that Mother is gone . You did n't tell me . A letter came yesterday from Hobbs . She 's at her sister 's and assumes I know . Why am I not told anything ? CHALK You got a letter from your mother ? Let me see it ! ( JAMES TAKES IT FROM HIS POCKET AND WEEBJOB GRABS IT FROM HIM . WEEBJOB OPENS THE LETTER AND READS . ) Your father , as you know , is a difficult man to live with. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( JAMES LOOKS AWAY FROM WEEBJOB . ) He is not a practical man , but is caught up in his ideals . I thought I would stay at my sister 's for a month , but I think continually of Weebjob , and how he is getting along without me to cook his meals and clean his house . I think I will finish the visit with my sister soon , and return to Salazar Canyon with Weebjob . I 'll ride the bus as far as Roswell and William will bring me home  --  ( WEEBJOB LOOKS TO HEAVEN . ) William knows too ! ( READS AGAIN . ) I do n't like to be away from Weebjob after all  --  p. 16 LONG CHALK How long has she been gone ? CHALK ( REGAINS HIS COMPOSURE . ) Fifteen days . LONG CHALK How did she get to Hobbs ? It must be two hundred miles  --  CHALK I took her to the junction in Carrizozo and she caught the bus . LONG CHALK That was nice of you . Why did n't you make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding the bus . I would have taken her to Hobbs if I knew you two were quarreling . CHALK We 're not quarreling ! She simply wanted to see her sister . And it is n't any business of yours . LONG CHALK Yes , it is . CHALK The letter she wrote to you is hard for me to accept . I got Sweet Grass at an Indian Female Seminary . She would hardly look at me , much less speak anything to me . Now she tells you all this ? ( HE READS THE REST OF THE LETTER IN SILENCE . ) LONG CHALK I suppose she wrote so that I would understand why she was n't here when I came . CHALK Mutton . You used to be too young to know anything . Now you 're told all . ( HE CRUMPLES THE LETTER AND HANDS IT BACK TO JAMES. ) p. 17 LONG CHALK Things change .

CHALK She leaves your house in Socorro for several days and you do n't even call  --  LONG CHALK She could have come back here for all I knew . CHALK But you did n't know . How long has she been gone ? ( JAMES PAUSES . ) How long ? LONG CHALK Probably a week . CHALK And WHAT did you do about it ? LONG CHALK I thought she 'd gone off with Pick Up  --  ( WEEBJOB HITS HIS HANDS AGAINST HIS SIDES IN ANGER . ) But when Pick Up showed up and did n't know  --  CHALK What else goes on in Socorro that I do n't know ? LONG CHALK Nothing , except Sweet Potato was gone for a while . ( WEEBJOB TURNS HIS BACK TO JAMES. )  --  Hersah did n't know anything either , except that Sweet Potato talked about Gallup and the restaurant where she worked one summer  --  p. 18 CHALK ( TURNS TO JAMES . ) Why did n't you tell me ? LONG CHALK Probably for the same reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's different . Sweet Grass is only at her sister 's . We ALL hear from her  --  it 's not like Sweet Potato disappearing  --  ( WEEBJOB TURNS ANGRILY TO JAMES AND POKES HIS FINGER AGAINST HIS SHOULDERS. )  --  I did n't have your advice when I wooed my wife . Why would I need it now to keep her ? She 'll return . ( PROUDLY . ) She writes that she ca n't stay away from me any longer . You read the letter . ( CONFIDENTLY . ) And Pick Up does n't have any more chance than an albino squirrel with my daughter . Where are they ? ( HE LOOKS IMPATIENTLY UP THE ROAD . ) LONG CHALK They 've hardly gotten to Old Lincoln . I think if he wanted your advice on how to woo Sweet Potato , he would ask . CHALK Mutton .

I need to get back to feed Weebjob . WILLINGDEER Let him wait . CHALK I 'll hear him bellering in the valley if we do n't get back soon  --  he 'll be painting another sign for the fence by the road  --  ( PICK UP TOUCHES HER FACE . ) WILLINGDEER Where were you for a week ? CHALK You already asked me , and I told you I was on the road . ( FOLDS HER ARMS . ) Why did you bring me back to him ? You know I did n't want to come . WILLINGDEER You ca n't run away , Sweet Potato . CHALK My name is Suzanne Long Chalk . WILLINGDEER I 'll call you what I please . I ca n't have you hitchhiking on the road for anyone to pick up . You should n't be out on the road alone . It 's not good . What would you do in Gallup ? CHALK Get a job . I can cook , wait tables . I worked there last summer , if you remember . p. 20 WILLINGDEER Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  I do n't want you to go back there . CHALK You sound like my father . WILLINGDEER It 's not as your father that I 'm speaking . Work at the Civil War in Old Lincoln if you must have a job . Let the men gawk at you . Wait tables . ( HE PAUSES AND LOOKS AT HER . ) I care for you , Suzanne . You know that . ( PAUSE . ) More than as a father . I did n't come to Socorro to see James . CHALK I told you I did n't want to speak of these things . WILLINGDEER I did n't for many years . But now I ca n't wait any longer . You 're more than Weebjob 's daughter to me . CHALK Maybe we could be like cousins . WILLINGDEER I want you as a close friend . CHALK We are close friends , Pick Up , my father 's friend . WILLINGDEER Yes , I 'm his friend . CHALK You would n't be if he heard you speak to me like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) p. 21 CHALK I remember you , Pick Up , when you used to have a brown Volkswagen , and looked like a prune driving it down the road . WILLINGDEER I remember you , Sweet Potato , in a round purple coat , like a plum on narrow legs , with skinny braids sticking out from beneath your cap . CHALK I remember the night you got drunk in the Civil War Bar in Old Lincoln and came to our house and quoted poetry to the weed-clumps . WILLINGDEER I remember when the faintest bit of snow blew into the valley and you ran into my truck on William 's bicycle and sprang the tire . CHALK I remember  --  ( PICK UP PUTS HIS HANDS OVER HER MOUTH . ) WILLINGDEER I remember when you fell into the stream . I should have let you drown . ( HE KISSES HER . ) CHALK Would you call him Father ? WILLINGDEER ( HE ROLLS HIS HEAD BACK . ) I would rather have a buffalo for a father-in-law . CHALK ( SHE TAKES UP FOR WEEBJOB . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 22 WILLINGDEER I know . CHALK Wise and good-hearted . Quick-tempered . A little harsh with words and his head too much in the Bible , but a good man . WILLINGDEER I do n't know what to do , Suzanne . I want you , and I wonder why . I 'm almost as old as your father . How could I think of you as a wife ? How could you think of me  --  CHALK Do n't talk about it . WILLINGDEER Marry me , Suzanne . CHALK I can hear Weebjob roaring about it now . WILLINGDEER He will be all right . Think about me , Sweet Potato . ( HE KISSES HER AGAIN . ) Marry me . CHALK Maybe it 's what you deserve . p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE III CHALK Ah ! Here come Rumpelstiltskin and Juliet now . LONG CHALK Be kind , Father . CHALK Why should I be otherwise ? LONG CHALK Because he 's doing better with Sweet Potato than you 're doing with Mother . CHALK Now I am angry , James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . LONG CHALK ( He laughs . ) It might not hurt you to get away . It might broaden you to travel . CHALK I get enough broadening here in Salazar Canyon . WILLINGDEER ( ENTERING . ) Ola , Weebjob . ( SWEET POTATO FOLLOWS . CARRYING A GROCERY SACK . SHE GOES INTO THE HOUSE . ) CHALK Ola , Pick Up .

If you 'd get off your place  --  CHALK It took you longer  --  p. 24 WILLINGDEER You know Clement Thousandsticks . ( HE JESTURES WITH HIS ARMS . ) He waits on the road until he sees us coming , then turns on the highway in front of us and goes slow through the canyon where no one can pass .

I know how hard it is for you to feel about Sweet Potato as you do . Break it gently to Weebjob when the time comes ! ! ! ( WEEBJOB 'S VOICE RISES AGAIN AS HE FINISHES READING HIS WIFE 'S LETTER TO PICK UP . ) Tell Sweet Potato I 'm fine  --  ( WEEBJOB POUNDS THE TABLE AGAIN , RISES TO HIS FEET. ) p. 31 WILLINGDEER ( ANGRY NOW . ) Let me ask you something , Weebjob  --  I 've known Sweet Potato since she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Sweet Potato . CHALK ( ANGRY ALSO . ) It might have been . WILLINGDEER That was twenty years ago . I 've seen her nearly every week since then . I have loved her for years . Tell me , Weebjob , Gerald Long Chalk , holy man of Salazar Canyon  --  why are you the only one who does n't know ? Are you so buried in YOUR work , you do n't know when your friend is in love with your daughter ? CHALK You as a son-in-law . No , by thunder . I wo n't have it . ( BANGS THE TABLE AGAIN . ) How old are you , Pick Up ? WILLINGDEER 43 , and Sweet Potato is 21 . It 's as though I 've always been waiting for her . CHALK Bull crackers . You just do n't want the responsibility of a wife and family . WILLINGDEER That might be right . I saw you snorting about it so much through the years , I thought it could n't be much fun . CHALK It 's a responsibility to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem , listening to you . CHALK Have you asked her to be your wife ? WILLINGDEER Yes , and she almost agreed . CHALK She does n't know what else to do with herself . She has n't even been able to make it to Gallup again . Maybe that 's why she almost gives in to you  --  ( WITH HIS FIST TO PICK UP . ) How many young girls are there in the valley ? Why my daughter ? WILLINGDEER I would love Sweet Potato no matter what her age . I want her to be my wife and I do n't want any old crank standing in the way . ( HE PUSHES HIS CHAIR AWAY FROM HIM WITH HIS FOOT . PICK UP AND WEEBJOB STAND FACING ONE ANOTHER . ) CHALK I 'm not having an old Poker for a son-in-law . WILLINGDEER You will if Sweet Potato agrees . CHALK Mutton . LONG CHALK Break it up , Weebjob . How silly to see two old bulls ready to fight . CHALK Even if one of the old bulls is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sweet Potato . p. 33 CHALK It 's up to me to give permission . CHALK It 's up to me , Father . I do n't have to have your permission . CHALK ( LOOKING UP TO HEAVEN . ) My father , Seewootee , never would have believed this ! WILLINGDEER Sweet Grass would return sooner if she knew you were close to a wedding . CHALK There 's not going to be a wedding yet ! ( PAUSE . ) I think she wrote to everyone but me  --  CHALK She has n't written to me either . I 've tried to be like her . But I am not my mother . I ca n't be her . I know she 's sweet and gentle . And I 'm not any of that  --  WILLINGDEER ( HE GOES TO SWEET POTATO , PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HER . ) Let 's walk up the road . ( HE DRAWS HER OFF THE PORCH . ) CHALK ( LOWERS HIS HEAD , LOOKS AT THEM WITH A SCOWL . ) Such patience it will take for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will move to Gallup , James . But I know they wo n't . I 'll probably have them here with me in Canaan  --  p. 34 LONG CHALK ( LAUGHS . ) I doubt that . CHALK Sweet Grass will return and weave behind my house . I 'll watch her make the roaming antelope design , bringing the pattern to a point , a place of finish . Her weaving is resolution . William will come with his wife with their baby , and Reesah will still be unhappy that she 's going to have another . She 'll cry and I will hear her blow her nose into her handkerchief .

WHEN SWEET POTATO HEARS THE WORD , MUTTON , FROM HER FATHER , SHE TURNS TO LOOK . ) I will probably marry you , Pick Up . WILLINGDEER Are you sure ? CHALK At this moment , I am . WILLINGDEER When I was your age , you were n't even born , Suzanne . Does that change your mind ? p. 36 CHALK No . WILLINGDEER What would change your mind ? CHALK Nothing that I can think of right now . WILLINGDEER Is it because you do n't have any place else to go ? CHALK No . I can stay with James and Hersah in Socorro . Reesah is going to have another baby  --  I could probably stay with William in Roswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( PAUSE . ) I can go to Gallup and work in the restaurant again  --  it 's just that the nights are so cavernous in the desert  --  WILLINGDEER I know . CHALK You do n't mind that I 'm young ? WILLINGDEER Not as much as having Weebjob for a father-in-law , and him always at a crossroads in his life . CHALK Ca n't we get married in the old Indian way ? WILLINGDEER No . CHALK You could give Weebjob some horses , and I would just move in with you . If it does n't work , I will put your bedroll by the door and you can move out . WILLINGDEER No. p. 37 CHALK You 'd want the horses back ? WILLINGDEER I do n't have any horses . CHALK Your truck , then ? WILLINGDEER Yes . I do n't want to lose my house and truck both . And I do n't want you to be able to get out of it that easily . CHALK I do n't like complications . WILLINGDEER You do n't want responsibility , Sweet Potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Old Lincoln Church . And I want you in a dress . I 'm going to have you as my wife , Suzanne . I expect you to clean the house , cook my suppers , wash the dishes and clothes . You are n't going to run off whenever you feel like it . You can visit James and Hersah in Socorro . Do what you like . But I will have your attention . Otherwise , do n't marry me . You are n't coming to see if you like it . You are making a commitment I expect you to keep . I wo n't have it any other way . I 'm from the old school too . CHALK And in trying to get away from Weebjob , I come to someone like him ? ( SHE SHRUGS HER SHOULDERS . ) WILLINGDEER I expect you to come to me as a wife who wants to live with me . I expect you to sacrifice your burning ambition to hitchhike to Gallup . I wo n't have it . I 'm old enough to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find on the highway with her thumb up . p. 38 CHALK And what do I get in return for my unending subjection to you ? WILLINGDEER I 'm taking you off Weebjob 's hands . He should be giving me the horses . I 'm giving you a chance to come where you will have respect as a person , and a chance to be on your own , to do as you want  --  CHALK As long as it is n't making sudden trips ? WILLINGDEER That 's right . I will give you a chance to open your wool store with your mother in Old Lincoln , if that 's what you want . I 'd even buy you some sheep . Or you can wait tables at the Civil War if you like . I would rather that you did n't , but you are your own person , Sweet Potato . And I know you 're struggling to find something that will satisfy you . I 'm not taking you away from that . I 'm giving you what you have n't had  --  CHALK It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PUTS HER HANDS TO HER FACE . ) Unless I find I do n't have any place I belong . WILLINGDEER ( HE HOLDS HER . ) Then you can be satisfied to be my wife . I 'm making a place in my house for you . CHALK One concession , Pick Up . WILLINGDEER What ? p. 39 CHALK No wedding in Old Lincoln Church , and not in a dress . Father 's zeal has always made me shudder in church . I want to be married here  --  in Canaan. CHALK ( HERE THE STAGE LIGHTS COME BACK . WEEBJOB IS IN HIS SQUASH PATCH . JAMES IS IN THE HOUSE WASHING THE POTS AND PANS AT THE SINK. )  --  Humbleness of mind , meekness , long suffering . ( WEEBJOB IS ON HIS KNEES PRAYING . ) Forbearing one another , forgiving one another . ( HE MAKES A FIST TOWARD HEAVEN . ) Could you make this any harder ?

But I have always liked the yellow blossoms . WILLINGDEER Weebjob would never allow a wedding there . That is holy ground to him . I do n't want to be married on his place anyway .

WILLINGDEER Sweet Potato has consented to marry me . LONG CHALK ( JUMPS UP . ) You are going to be my brother-in-law !

I go hungry , and do not learn . ( HE KISSES HER AGAIN . ) Your wife did n't come ? p. 43 LONG CHALK She did n't feel well enough to come . I did n't bring my daughter because I wanted a chance to talk to Mother . The last time we took her for a ride it took Reesah and I both to hold on to her . LONG CHALK Hello , William . LONG CHALK James . ( THEY EMBRACE , BRIEFLY . ) LONG CHALK Nothing is wrong , though ? LONG CHALK No . She 's well . Just pregnant and not happy about it at the moment . She thinks a two-year-old and a baby will be a lot to handle . I do n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time  --  WILLINGDEER Hello , William . LONG CHALK ( HE SMILES . ) Hello , Pick Up .

I did n't want William to go any more out of his way  --  ( SWEET GRASS EMBRACES HER DAUGHTER. ) p. 44 CHALK We did n't know when you were coming back . After all the letters you wrote to everyone but me  --  LONG CHALK I wrote you , Sweet Potato . CHALK It never came . LONG CHALK It 's at the General Delivery in Old Lincoln . CHALK ( SWEET POTATO HITS HER HEAD . ) How could I not think of that ? Of course  --  and we were just there . I 've missed you , Mother . ( JAMES HUGS HIS MOTHER . ) CHALK Is my letter at General Delivery too ? I have a mailbox on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here now and then  --  CHALK When he can find it among your signs . LONG CHALK I see you have a few new ones , Father . ( WILLIAM GOES INTO THE HOUSE WITH HIS MOTHER 'S SUITCASE .

CHALK Did n't know what to say ! ( HE CLAPS HIS HANDS TO HIS SIDE . ) You told everyone everything that ever happened ! p. 45 LONG CHALK I did n't know how to write to you  --  CHALK Sweet Grass , my old wife back from her sister 's in Hobbs . Already things are better . I must make a sign for the fence . How is Mary Jane Collar ? LONG CHALK She 's fine , Gerald Long Chalk . CHALK Canaan is n't the same without you . LONG CHALK I wanted to get back to my loom behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feet while I weave . I even missed you too , Weebjob . CHALK Ah ! But not everything is well . We might get a buffalo for a son-in-law . LONG CHALK I 've known it for some time , Weebjob . CHALK So your letters to everyone said . LONG CHALK I was afraid to tell you . CHALK You certainly were n't afraid to tell all of Salazar Canyon about it . LONG CHALK Forgive me , Weebjob . I found that I liked to write letters when I was at Mary Jane Collar 's . It made me feel like I was with everyone . I 've never been away for a long time . CHALK How did you know about Sweet Potato and Pick Up ? p. 46 LONG CHALK I could tell they were in love . Even before Sweet Potato knew . At first , it upset me too . But now I 'm used to it . He might just be the husband Sweet Potato needs . CHALK I do n't know if I feel more sorry for Pick Up or Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOUSE WITH JAMES AND CALLS TO WEEBJOB AND SWEET GRASS . ) I have to get back to Roswell . CHALK ( SWEET GRASS TAKES WEEBJOB BY THE HAND AND THEY RETURN TO WILLIAM AND JAMES IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE . PICK UP AND SWEET POTATO SIT ON THE FRONT STEPS . ) Yes , I understand . Your job and family . But you 'll be returning soon  --  LONG CHALK Thank you for bringing me back to Cannan. ( THEY EMBRACE ALSO . WILLIAM LEAVES . ) I want to speak to you , Sweet Potato . ( SWEET POTATO LOOKS AT PICK UP . ) WILLINGDEER I 'll wait here with James . I need to get back to Old Lincoln after a while  --  I left in a hurry to look for you  --  ( PICK UP TALKS WITH JAMES ON THE FRONT STEPS WHILE THE WOMEN TALK BY THE FENCE OF WEEBJOB 'S SQUASH PATCH . WEEBJOB GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND WORKS AT PAINTING ANOTHER SIGN TO HANG ON HIS FENCE BY THE ROAD. ) p. 47 LONG CHALK Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CHALK No , I 'm not . LONG CHALK Do you love him ? CHALK Yes , I always have . I feel like I belong with him . I 'm not excited or bored with him . He 's just there . LONG CHALK But you ca n't go running away , as you have from us . CHALK I know . He 's said as much . LONG CHALK Is there anything you 'd rather do ? CHALK Yes , but it 's unattainable . I do n't like school . I ca n't be like William and go to college . I barely finished high school . And I was n't in the right place like James when he found his job . That desert clodhopper . He just happened to apply for a job and the horticulturist took him ! LONG CHALK He always liked the squash patch and cactus . CHALK I 've looked and seen things I 've wanted , but I could never have them . There 's never been any place for me , Mother . I do n't want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables . I 'm happy when I 'm on my way to Gallup . There is n't any room for me here on Canaan. LONG CHALK Yes , there is . You 're our daughter . p. 48 CHALK But I 'm not your child any more . LONG CHALK Just so Pick Up is n't a father to you that you 'd resent like Weebjob . CHALK ( SHE LOOKS AT HER MOTHER . ) No . He 's one of my friends , though he 's older . LONG CHALK He 's more like a brother ? CHALK No . He 's not like William or James to me . He 's not Weebjob to me either . How could they have been friends for so long ? They 're different from one another . LONG CHALK They compliment each other somehow . CHALK Pick Up also asks me why I want to marry him . LONG CHALK What do you tell him ? CHALK What I tell you . LONG CHALK You do n't know what else to do so you 're going to try marriage ? CHALK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't true . I do want to be with him . I think I always did , but was afraid it would look ridiculous . Now I might marry him . We could live in Old Lincoln and drive to Socorro to see James and Hersah on the weekends . Maybe  --  I could have a wool store . I even have a name for it . p. 49 LONG CHALK What ? CHALK The Spinners. I might even be able to have sheep on Pick Up 's place . LONG CHALK Will you finally let me teach you to weave ? CHALK Maybe . You 'll be supplier of the blankets I sell . LONG CHALK There is n't anyone else you want to marry ? CHALK There have been others . But they married someone else , or went off , or were n't interested in me . One was so worthless I knew the marriage would never work . LONG CHALK And you never had a child to shame us . What if someone came  --  more your age ? CHALK I would still be Pick Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother . He 's a friend  --  I want him to be my husband . LONG CHALK ( PUTS HER ARM AROUND SWEET POTATO . ) I 've always liked Pick Up though if I 'd known he would be my son-in-law , I might have kicked about it at first . But now I feel differently . I can see him as your husband . I can understand why he loves you . CHALK What is it like to be a wife ? LONG CHALK It probably feels differently to every wife . To me it feels right to be Weebjob 's wife . I see him as the man he wants to be , even when he falls short of it . p. 50 CHALK Which is most of the time . LONG CHALK No , it is n't . He 's a good man . I like to look at him , feel him against me , listen to him . I should n't be speaking of these things to you . But I must be with him . Even if he is in the squash patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I hear his prayers , his chants . When he has visions of the Thunder Hawk , I leave him to himself . He 's my companion . I do n't know what I 'd do without him . I suppose I 'd go live with Mary Jane Collar and we 'd can cactus jelly and paint her back steps . He 's all I thought about in Hobbs  --  CHALK You could live with us . LONG CHALK No . You would be camping out with Pick Up or hiking in the mountains . I would not feel welcome in my son's-in-law house , nor my daughter's-in-law , nor with James either . Do you think he 'll marry Hersah ? CHALK I do n't know . She really does n't want to get married . LONG CHALK I do n't like it . I 'm from the old school , like Weebjob . CHALK James knows that , Mother . He might be uncomfortable with it too . He 's gone a lot . The highway crews are n't a steady group . They might influence him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHALK I ca n't answer for him . William is really the only one of us that could endure discomfort for what he wanted . Well , James too , I guess . He reads his horticulture books at night until Hersah gets mad . Sometimes she and I go to the movies , or just into town and talk with the boys . But Hersah did n't like any of the boys the way she likes James . I may have liked some of the boys now and then , but I did n't want to be with them very long . Pick Up makes me feel happy , Mother . He 's someone to hold on to when there 's nowhere for me , no place I really fit . ( SWEET POTATO HOLDS HER HANDS TO HER EARS . ) Sometimes I wonder why I was even born . LONG CHALK Sweet Potato . Such talk ! CHALK Everyone can do something but me . LONG CHALK You just have n't found your place yet . The Long Chalks have always had God 's blessing . CHALK I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy William 's wife . I probably wo n't be a good mother either . LONG CHALK I think you will . There 's not much in the marriage for her right now but children and housework because William works such long hours . CHALK ( ENTERS AND JOINS THE CONVERSATION . ) Daughter , are you marrying Pick Up ? p. 52 CHALK It seems that way . CHALK Are you sure it 's what you want ? CHALK Maybe it will be my Canaan. Maybe I will finally understand  --  CHALK There 's no way marriage to Pick Up could be avoided ? CHALK You would n't like it . LONG CHALK Dad  --  CHALK God 's blessing on your marriage , Suzanne Long Chalk . ( THEY EMBRACE . ) CHALK ( AS WEEBJOB STARTS TOWARD JAMES. )  --  You still seem reserved about it . CHALK ( TURNS BACK TO SWEET POTATO . ) Pick Up has not yet asked my permission to marry you . LONG CHALK ( SWEET GRASS AND SWEET POTATO STAY AT THE FENCE AND TALK A WHILE LONGER . WEEBJOB GOES TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PICK UP REMAINS ON THE STEPS . ) Do you want me to close your paint cans ? CHALK At least someone asks something of me . ( PUTS HIS ARM AROUND JAMES ' SHOULDER BUT LOOKS AT PICK UP . ) Yes . How trying to think I will have Pick Up as a son-in-law  --  p. 53 LONG CHALK Weebjob , you 're like the Malpais lava pits beyond Carrizozo . Pick Up will be a good husband to Sweet Potato . CHALK Maybe before I make my death cry , I will understand it all . LONG CHALK ( THEY CLOSE WEEBJOB 'S PAINT CAN . ) Sometimes you 're like one of the trees in the nursery truck with your roots wrapped in a bag of sand . ( THERE 'S A NEW SIGN WHICH READS , YOU SHOULD LIVE SO LONG. ) CHALK I guess it 's my strict upbringing  --  LONG CHALK I 'd like for you to be more  --  with us. I 'd like to hear the sound of the rototiller on your land . CHALK ( WEEBJOB IS DISTRACTED BECAUSE SWEET POTATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Ah ! My wife is back . I will watch Sweet Grass weave  --  making form out of all those strands of wool , then I can make sense of everything again  --  ( SWEET GRASS ENTERS THE HOUSE .

HE FINALLY SHAKES HIS HEAD IN AGREEMENT. ) p. 54 WILLINGDEER Weebjob , father of Sweet Potato , may I have a word with you before I leave ? CHALK ( HE AND JAMES WALK TO THE FRONT OF THE PORCH . ) You may stay , James . WILLINGDEER I would like to speak to you alone . CHALK Denied . WILLINGDEER I would like permission to marry your daughter . LONG CHALK ( JAMES LOOKS TO THE SKY , EMBARRASSED THAT HE 'S THERE . ) It 's a long drive to Socorro  --  I need  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ah ! I was waiting for that . In the old days the father was the leader of the family . He was the thinker , the medicine man , the holy man , the elder . He was respected . No decisions were made until HE was asked . He had an HONORABLE place . WILLINGDEER You have an honorable place , Weebjob , father of Sweet Potato , as long as you do n't carry it too far and make a burro of yourself . CHALK So you want to marry my daughter ? WILLINGDEER And you consent ? p. 55 CHALK No , I do n't . WILLINGDEER ( HE LOOKS AT SWEET POTATO . ) I knew he would be obstinate . That 's why I did n't want to ask him . LONG CHALK Dad  --  CHALK Does this concern you ? ( SWEET POTATO GETS UP AND EXITS STAGE LEFT . ) WILLINGDEER Weebjob , father of Sweet Potato , holy man , prophet of Salazar Canyon , may I have permission to marry your daughter ? CHALK I know you 're serious about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from God . Now I know . Whom He loves He chastens . It does n't seem I have any choice . Yes , Pick Up , you have my permission to marry Sweet Potato . I wish it could be some other way  --  ( PAUSE . ) But I 've already given her my blessing . WILLINGDEER Thank you , Weebjob . LONG CHALK Thank you , Father . ( PICK UP LEAVES STAGE TO FIND SWEET POTATO . ) CHALK Now maybe he 'll stay home . LONG CHALK I have to leave now . Hersah will have supper waiting by the time I get there  --  ( THEY SAY GOODBYE AND JAMES WALKS PAST PICK UP AND SWEET POTATO . ) I 'll talk to you later . ( HE EXITS. ) p. 56 WILLINGDEER Weebjob has consented , and I did n't injure him before he did . CHALK You have shown patience . WILLINGDEER Now , when we can get married ? CHALK As soon as you like . But I wo n't wear a dress . WILLINGDEER And I will NOT be married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) See that bright spot in the desert where the sun comes through the clouds and makes a ring of light ? CHALK When I 'm standing on the road with my thumb up , the heat trying to take my breath , the fear of passing cars pounding in my chest , I feel one with the land . The shrubs speak to me like children . The dry river beds maybe without a trickle of water . I wash in the heat and feel alive on Interstate 40 West . Not straining for existence any longer , but filled with meaning . WILLINGDEER But what 's in Gallup ? CHALK Nothing , I guess , but getting there . I forget I 'm a reject of this world . When I 'm on my way to Gallup , I 'm INDIAN . I like these worn hills with wrinkles like an old man 's face , and with sand as brown as our skin . The divided highway is not like 380 through the canyon . Wind plays with my hair and the heat laughs  --  the terrible heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin are open and we are running with the heat . Not hardly anyone knows but us . I like the morning sun on my back and the long fingers of the evening shadow across the highway . I want to go again across the Cibolo County line to Gallup . p. 57 WILLINGDEER I believe you do , Suzanne . CHALK Palomino rocks . Mountains and plateaus . Sometimes I sit in the shade of a bush and listen to the cars pass . ( PICK UP LOOKS AWAY FROM HER A MOMENT . IT 'S HARD FOR HIM TO LISTEN TO PART OF WHAT SHE SAYS , ESPECIALLY WHEN HE REALIZES THERE IS DANGER IN WHAT SHE DOES . ) I do n't ride with anyone who stops . I look them over first . There are white men who would use me  --  WILLINGDEER ( TURNS AWAY FROM HER . ) Indians too . CHALK That 's why they ca n't see and feel the life of the desert , and ca n't hear the Great Spirit walking in the heat  --  in the midst of the fiery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . ( HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER . ) What 's the matter , Pick Up ? WILLINGDEER Go to Gallup . Maybe you have more there on the road than I can give you . CHALK When I get as far as Mesita I know I 'll make it . Rock slides where the highway cuts through the plateaus . Payute . Cubero . James goes up into the Pios Mountains , but I have to go farther . WILLINGDEER All the way to Gallup ! p. 58 CHALK What 's wrong with hitchhiking to Gallup ? WILLINGDEER It is n't for a woman . CHALK It 's exactly for me . Every place speaks my name and I know what to call them in return . The cactus and hills and arroyos . WILLINGDEER I do n't want you on the highway for another man to see . I do n't want you misused , Sweet Potato . You can understand that . I want to protect you  --  ( HE LOOKS AT THE GROUND . ) I want to consume you myself . CHALK Last week before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafael . Quemado . I do n't ride with anyone . Sometimes it 's like they 're dead already when I look at their eyes . They look like a lava rock to me . ( SHE TOUCHES PICK UP . ) I 'm glad you worry about me . It 's always been me who saw others look at you . I remember the women who wanted you  --  why did n't you ever marry after the first time ? WILLINGDEER I never found anyone I really wanted to marry . But you 've caught me , Suzanne . You have a sweetness too , like your mother . You get a little rusty sometimes , like the desert water in my well  --  but you 're not so tough , Miss Long Chalk . I wo n't tell anyone , though . p. 59 CHALK Sometimes the jackrabbits hop right in front of me . ( SHE IGNORES HIM . ) Pick Up , I 'm alive on the road to Gallup . WILLINGDEER It 's suicide for you to hitchhike , Sweet Potato . CHALK I 've run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PICK UP . ) There was a man who tried to pick me up once . He followed me along the highway for a while , but I would n't get into his car . WILLINGDEER ( ANGRY WITH HER . ) God , Sweet Potato . CHALK I always got away from any trouble . WILLINGDEER But you might not always  --  how can I let you go ? I remember when you had to sit on books to reach the supper table . And now you 're hitchhiking ? Why do you want to go to Gallup ?

To be around someone in love is like being in a mountain storm when the sky comes down upon you . The young are restless as the pines . But what 's his excuse ?

CHALK In the reservation and boarding schools as a boy , I first saw the Thunder Hawk vision . I did n't need peyote for it to come . LONG CHALK Weebjob , you do n't bend . CHALK No , Wife . It 's by faith we see these things . p. 62 LONG CHALK We do n't all see as you do , Weebjob . CHALK ( HE LOOKS AT HER AS SHE WEAVES . ) You never used to contradict me , Sweet Grass . LONG CHALK Because I express my opinion , you call it contradiction ? Have n't I always been free to say what I think ? CHALK Yes , because what you 've said always agreed with what I thought you should say . LONG CHALK But if I should want to say something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I should be quiet ? CHALK You 're not going back to visit your sister . LONG CHALK ( LAUGHS . ) It is n't her . CHALK ( SWEET POTATO JOINS HER PARENTS AFTER PICK UP LEAVES . ) Is he threatening to return you to the Female Seminary ? LONG CHALK Nearly . CHALK I ca n't . It 's closed down . CHALK It should have never been opened . LONG CHALK It was n't that bad , Sweet Potato . There was such upheaval in our lives  --  it was probably the best place for us . ( PAUSE . ) Why are you always against school ? p. 63 CHALK Why do you ask such stupid questions ? ( ANGRILY . ) Because I could n't do it ! You ought to know that !

LONG CHALK It 's not easy for anyone . I remember how hard it was to learn . The days were long  --  and the nights  --  memories were frightening as the booger dancers . Those wooden masks with their horrid faces jumped into my dreams . ( SHE LOOKS AT WEEBJOB . ) There were puzzling times too . I remember the heat under my nightdress where I had not felt a man  --  CHALK ( EMBARRASSED BY HER MOTHER 'S SUDDEN FRANKNESS . ) I never knew you felt anything like that , Mother . ( SWEET POTATO HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN AWE OF HER MOTHER , AND FELT SHE COULD NEVER EQUAL HER .

I did n't have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . But later  --  those feelings always stayed unspoken . CHALK How could you marry like that ? The very thought of it turns my skin . LONG CHALK We did n't know any other way . CHALK You 're quiet for once , Weebjob . CHALK Ah ! Yes , I am . I was listening to Sweet Grass , and did n't know what to say . I remembered when I went to the Female Seminary for a wife . I had a friend who I went to see , and all the girls out on the lawn made me think it was a place to get a wife . I was thinking of the boarding school for Indian boys  --  ( PAUSE . ) I like this time of evening . I remember the fingers of the sun across the yard of the boarding school from the canyons and arroyos as evening reached from the parched desert . We could n't ignore it . We woke up in the morning sweating with the heat . It only intensified during the day . We could n't ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . Our heritage was rich with tradition , and it was taken from us . We had to learn a new way , against our will . I longed for Indian ways just as the others . Christianity was n't enough . And nothing came to fill the particular hunger we felt . Others grew bitter , later drank and wasted their lives . But I have always felt the closeness of the Great Spirit , and that he would manifest himself to me . Why would I have the hunger if there was nothing to fill it ? And in the desolation of the nights , when I could hear other boys cry or moan with nightmares , the vision of the Thunder Hawk came , not the vision , for it was the Thunder Hawk himself . A magnificant bird from the spirit world full of light like a blue , stained-glass window in a cathedral . The vine at the window in the winter also reminded me of him . When the land was even deader than it was in summer . The dry vine rattling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to me right through the walls of the boarding school for Indian boys . It was like the sweat lodge I heard about from the old Indian men before we were taken to school . It seemed to me to be Canaan that was talked about in the Book . And this place too , here where I 've lived all these years , where I can do what I want without fear or interference . It is Canaan. I see the Thunder Hawk to this day . He has never left me . Great Spirit , how can you merge with us , who are mortal in our flesh and bound with error and filled with weakness ? I must go to the squash patch for a while . I feel the wind over me like the presence of the Great Spirit  --  like the hot shower in the motel in Roswell when William got married and I stayed until the water ran cold and Sweet Grass called for me to get out .
