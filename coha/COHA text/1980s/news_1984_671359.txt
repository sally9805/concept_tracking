A member of the Hunt family of Dallas , the clergy , the Allis Chalmers Corporation , employees who receive company awards , automobile dealers , the fishing industry - all would be in line for tax relief , provided the Senate ' s version survives after a conference committee irons out differences between the Senate bill and one approved by the House. // These special tax provisions are all part of how one gathers votes in the Senate . " This is the grease that smoothes the path , " a Senate Finance Committee staff member said . Not all are likely to become law , of course . But merely including such cuts , while knowing they will die in conference , is also part of the greasing . It gives senators a record that they tried. // // Items Large and Small // The various tax breaks come to about $14 billion , not counting the $11 billion in tax forgiveness for companies that sell a lot abroad. // The $14 billion does include some big-ticket items of broad application , such as the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts . But many other items are small and custom-tailored , often of the million-dollar variety that has become too modest for senators to quibble over now that deficits are reckoned in hundreds of billions. // When the bill was debated , Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum , the Ohio Democrat who is a self-appointed tax policeman , set out to oppose many of these small special items . But he quickly admitted that he lacked the votes to block them. // His first effort was to strike a proposal by Senator Jake Garn , Republican of Utah , to allow a company to give an employee up to $4 , 800 in awards , such as watches or medallions , in one year and deduct their cost as a business expense . The provision , which the committee staff said was actually drafted by an industry lobbyist , triples the deduction a company can take and , for the first time , makes the award tax-free to the employee. // According to his press secretary , Mr. Garn submitted the item for the O. C. Tanner Company of Salt Lake City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury an estimated $311 million through 1987 . But Mr. Metzenbaum , who dubbed the provision " the jewelry industry amendment , " lost , 64 to 18 , when he tried to delete it . <> <> The DISC Provision // // The $11 billion provision for exporters would benefit companies that had set up domestic international sales corporations . The DISC , a device to spur sales abroad , was approved in the early 1970 ' s , allowing such corporate giants as the General Electric Company , the Boeing Company , the Allied Corporation and McDonnell Douglas Corporation to defer taxes on exports . As of 1982 , Allied had deferred $76 million , McDonnell Douglas $290. 5 million and Boeing $292 million , Mr. Metzenbaum ' s staff calculated. // When the DISC was debated , proponents promised that it would not eventually lead to forgiveness of these deferred taxes , which is exactly what the new bill will do in switching to a new kind of export incentive . The companies lobbied for the tax forgiveness through the Emergency Committee for American Trade. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve tax breaks for specific projects or deals covering convention centers and other projects , from museums to city office buildings , in at least 30 states . Without these exceptions , which the Senators refer to as " transition rules , " new restrictions proposed in the bill would take those tax breaks away. // A deftly drafted transition rule can enable a senator to vote for tightening the tax law and raising revenue , while simultaneously sheltering a local project from the effect . Senator Alfonse M. D ' Amato of New York , a Republican , obtained a transition rule to allow the use of tax-exempt industrial development bonds in financing the sale of Roosevelt Raceway in Hempstead , N.Y. The bill otherwise prohibits the use of these bonds in the purchase of a gambling facility . <> <> Specific Beneficiaries in Mind // Though stated in general language , some tax cuts were drafted with particular people or companies in mind. // One would extend a provision allowing installment payment of estate taxes . According to the committee staff , it was intended for Ray Hunt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the family that owns Hallmark Cards . Senators John C. Danforth , Republican of Missouri , and Lloyd Bentsen , Democrat of Texas , backed the change. // How much these families would save is unclear , but the estimated revenue loss through 1987 is about $60 million , assuming that other families also invoke the provision. // Another transition rule would save the Allis-Chalmers Corporation of Wisconsin $16 million in taxes . It is building a coal gasification facility in Illinois , and the rule , backed by Senator Charles H. Percy , Republican of Illinois , would let it exploit leasing benefits that Congress curbed in 1982 . <> <> Some Rather Minute Changes // // Some provisions are , by Congressional standards , minute . Mr. Metzenbaum forced Senator Russell B. Long , the Louisiana Democrat and former Finance chairman , to defend a $750 , 000 break for the Pan American Life Insurance Company of New Orleans . Mr. Long justified the effort by saying that much of Pan American Life ' s business is in Central America and thus riskier than usual. // Another provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submillimeter telescope to be used at the University of Arizona ' s Steward Observatory in a joint project with the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in West Germany . This was won by Senator Dennis DeConcini , Democrat of Arizona. // One 28-line section deep in the bill , proposed by Mr. Metzenbaum , would prevent the Internal Revenue Service from charging a Chicago woman $20 , 000 in penalities and interest , provided she paid the income tax owed on a $75 , 000 house she won on a radio show . The house was built to accommodate her handicapped foster son . An anonymous benefactor has paid the tax for her , but not the penalties or interest . <> <> For the Fishing Industry // // The fishing and fish-processing industry won a provision that would save it about $74 million in taxes through 1987 . Under current law , a company can contribute to a fund for building a ship and neither the contribution nor the interest earned on it is taxable , even when the money is withdrawn to pay for the ship . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be expanded to on-shore fish-processing facilities. // In another section , automobile dealers won protection from a court decision that would take away their depreciation tax breaks in certain automobile leasing deals . In 1984 and 1985 this clause would save the leasing industry about $79 million in taxes. // The tax bill also extends through next year an exemption for the clergy , allowing them to use their parsonage allowances , which are tax- free , to pay mortgage interest and property taxes on their homes and nevertheless deduct the payments on their tax returns. // The Senate Finance Committee version of the bill took this exemption away , as did an I.R.S. ruling last year , but Senators Jesse Helms of North Carolina and John W. Warner of Virginia , both Republicans , restored it on the Senate floor . For good measure , they added a similar exemption for military personnel. // //
