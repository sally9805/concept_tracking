A few believe Carter can not win-and want an alternative <P> Even as Jimmy Carter was sweeping toward renomination , there was grumbling last week among Democrats about him as their candidate . They are worried about the latest polls , which show Ronald Reagan leading Carter by up to nine percentage points ; and they fear that Carter may not be able to recover by November because of the public 's discontent over the economy and foreign policy . <P> The loudest complaints were voiced by Democratic Governor Hugh Carey of New York . He urged Carter and Senator Edward Kennedy to release their delegates to permit a " totally open convention . " Democratic Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York agreed . Said he : " To choose between the two of them Carter and Kennedy is hardly going to help us put together a ticket that has a chance to win in November . " Other Democrats have talked wistfully , but unrealistically , of drafting Vice President Walter Mondale . Democratic Senator Henry ( " Scoop " ) Jackson of Washington , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " people come up to me almost every day and say , ' I wish you were running . ' " <P> The talk of an open convention infuriates Carter 's aides . " A bizarre suggestion at best , " said Tim Kraft , coordinator of the President 's field campaign . Scoffed New York Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo , a rival of Carey 's and supporter of Carter 's : " It sounds as though Carey is saying that if you get to the eighth inning and you do n't like the score , you should change the rules . " <P> Indeed , changing the rules is just what Kennedy 's strategists have in mind . They realize it is now virtually impossible for him to win enough of the remaining delegates to get the nomination on the first ballot . That would require him to win about 80% of the vote on June 3 , when Democrats in eight states will choose 696 delegates , almost one-fifth of those who will go to the convention in August . <P> Kennedy hopes to do well enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can win in November . Then , according to scenario , Kennedy partisans will persuade the delegates at the convention to change Rule 11H , which requires delegates pledged to a candidate to vote for that candidate on the first ballot . This would enable defectors from Carter to abstain on the first ballot or to vote for Kennedy . Said Paul Kirk , political director of the Kennedy campaign : " Most of these delegates are free and independent , thinking citizens who care about the party and its direction . " <P> But the Kennedy strategy is unlikely to work . Rule 11H also empowers a candidate to replace wavering delegates with staunch supporters . To identify potential defectors , about 75 Carter supporters are now researching the backgrounds of all Carter delegates . In addition , staffers phone the delegates regularly to encourage them to stay loyal . Said Tom Donilon , a Carter campaign aide : " There is no evidence of defections anywhere . But we are not taking any chances . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
