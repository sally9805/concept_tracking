I attempted to rise , but was not able to stir : for as I happened to lie on my back , I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground . . . I likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body , from my armpits to my thighs . . . I felt something alive moving on my left leg , which . . . I perceived to be a human creature not six inches high , with a bow and arrow in his hands . <P>  --  Jonathan Swift , Gulliver 's Travels <P> Do you recognize the little fellow ? He might be a lawyer or an income tax supervisor , an editor or a banker or a Medicaid investigator , or a number of other things . At least that might be the view of anybody who had recently been engaged in rebuilding a house or paying taxes , writing something or borrowing money or paying a hospital bill , or a number of other things . In fact , almost anything . The question is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booming $3 trillion economy , between the people who actually make things or actually provide services and the people who are paid to prevent the others from making things or providing services ? One to two ? One to three ? And if this is the case , why is it the case ? <P> Consider , for example , the sad story of Warner LeRoy 's attempt to help rebuild Manhattan 's Bryant Park , a nine-acre urban oasis now inhabited largely by drug peddlers . Almost four years ago , New York City authorities announced a grand rehabilitation scheme that would feature the construction of a glass- walled cafe-restaurant . LeRoy , who operates the city-owned Tavern on the Green in Central Park , offered to build the restaurant with $12 million of his own money . " That will help make the park a great , wonderful public gathering place , " said LeRoy , " like the Via Veneto or the Piazza San Marco . " <P> LeRoy did spend several hundred thousand dollars on architectural plans , legal fees and so on , but there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bryant Park Restoration Corp . and the New York Public Library ( which adjoins the park ) and all the private watchdog groups that doggedly keep watch over the fall of every sparrow . After nearly four years of effort and expense , with no actual building begun and no end in sight , LeRoy this spring abandoned the whole project . " The process has so many hands in it that it is terribly hard to do without being reduced to mediocrity , " said LeRoy . " I do n't know what the answer is . I know you ca n't ! just do it with endless committees making endless comments . " <P> It is easy enough to blame such situations on the proliferation of government regulations and the heavy hand of government itself . President Reagan , for one , took that approach a while back when he publicly denounced his own Medicaid administrators for paying $12,000 a month to keep 3-year-old Katie Beckett in a hospital but refusing to pay the mere $2,000 it would have cost for her to live at home . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . Katie was duly sent home , and a new committee was named to check on the several dozen other Katies caught in similar red- tape tangles.
