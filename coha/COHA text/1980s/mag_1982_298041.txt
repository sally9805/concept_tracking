Heavyweights <P> To the Editors : <P> I have never thought of boxers as eloquent speakers . Yet your profile on Gerry Cooney June 14 , showing his concern and appreciation for his followers , exhibited refreshing values in these days of the overpaid athlete who cares only for his paycheck . Despite the outcome of his fight with Larry Holmes , Cooney has already proved himself a champion . <P> Fred S. Ostern Arlington , Va . <P> <P> Thank you for your story on Sylvester Stallone . He has made three excellent films portraying that lovable character , Rocky Balboa . I never thought I would enjoy watching two grown men beat each other up , but the Rocky movies have brought me to like the sport . <P> Connie Crowley Vienna , Va . <P> <P> I wondered why Gerry Cooney , a pretender to the crown , and Sylvester Stallone , a heavyweight champion only in the movies , were pictured together . After the Holmes-Cooney bout , I know . Cooney and Stallone are both actors . <P> <P> Jeannette M. Johnson Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly was a genuine news story . It was an unpredictable match . With a white contender it had an element of novelty . And finally , boxing itself , of which the heavyweight title is the epitome , is enjoying a renaissance . Perhaps a TIME cover was in order . But to juxtapose this story next to one about a thoroughly mediocre movie is sheer gimmickry . <P> <P> Paul Riley Seattle <P> What is it going to take for Larry Holmes to get the recognition he deserves ? In spite of being a champion , he is forced to accept equal pay and equal billing with an untested challenger , who in turn gets to be the subject of your cover story . Holmes may not be a Louis or a Marciano or an Ali , but then they are not Larry Holmes either . <P> <P> Leslie M. Rosato Whitehouse , N.J. <P> <P> You owe Larry Holmes a cover . <P> Jean Codon Allentown , Pa . <P> <P> European Summit <P> For all its pomp and ceremony , the Versailles summit June 14 failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to help the Third World . Though mutual pledges were exchanged and an appearance of unity was displayed , once the spell of Versailles has faded , each of the seven will lapse again into nationalistic self-interest . The Western world badly wants unity , but the summit was just another show of pageantry . <P> Franois Vannereau Besanqon , France <P> Ronald Reagan 's assertive role at the Versailles summit , plus his recent nuclear arms-reduction overture to the Soviets , should forever lay to rest the assumption that the President is ready to push the button and blow us all to hell ! Your picture of Ronald Reagan saluting French Gardes Rpublicaines captures the President 's jaunty style . We have not seen flair and savoir-vivre like his in any of our leaders since John F. Kennedy . <P> <P> Harold O. Christensen San Francisco <P> I am unsure about Reagan 's Grand Tour . I do not see him accomplishing anything from this short of filling his photo album , yet I commend him for his efforts . <P> <P> Jeff Ramsay Amherst , Mass . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
