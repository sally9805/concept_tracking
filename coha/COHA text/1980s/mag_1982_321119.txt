Flush with success , antinuclear groups still lack direction <P> It was an altogether impressive turnout in New York City 's Central Park . Upwards of 700,000 people assembled for a festive day of speeches by antinuclear activists and pop music by antinuclear performers . " That was America out there , " said New York City Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis . But what did America want ? <P> Virtually everyone shared an acute concern about the prospect of nuclear war . An overwhelming majority favored an immediate U.S.-Soviet freeze on the development of nuclear arms . But beyond those points of agreement , the consensus was shaky . Some groups urged continued public education about the dangers of nuclear arms , but proposed no particular political action . At the other extreme , a few argued blithely for unilateral U.S. disarmament . Thronging along , too , were dozens of divergent factions seeking to hitch a ride on the antinuclear bandwagon to promote just about everything from Government day care funding to African development . <P> The broad appeal of the antinuclear arms movement , which up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become its most serious weakness . With so many constituents to please , the movement seems uncertain about what to do next . There is a vision of ultimate success , of course : the dismantling of all the world 's nuclear arsenals , no more threat of annihilation . With this dream no sane person can quibble . Where the disagreement comes is over what workable , real-world arms control measures will be acceptable and , even more , how to achieve them . <P> Hundreds of towns and states have endorsed practically identical freeze resolutions , all of which call on President Reagan to pursue such a treaty with the Soviet Union . In California , campaigners for a bilateral freeze initiative , placed by petition on November 's ballot , have an advertising budget of $1.2 million . Yet all the widely supported antinuclear initiatives are almost certain to be only symbolic outcries , since neither the House nor Senate is likely to heed the calls for an immediate nuclear freeze . In any case , Reagan is adamantly opposed ; he believes such an arms control gambit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moreover , only lock in a putative Soviet nuclear advantage . <P> Even some allied with the movement are unhappy about the obsession with a simple freeze . " We ca n't just say , ' We want a freeze , ' and pray that we get one , " explains Ezekiel Emanuel , a second-year student at Harvard Medical School . " We have to articulate a position on what the next step is in the long process of ending the arms race . " Roger Molander , the former White House strategic analyst who heads Ground Zero , a scrupulously non-partisan antinuclear educational campaign , understands that it is hard for an impassioned mass movement to accommodate either slow practical progress or technical complexity . " What people are looking for , " says Molander , " is someone who will say , ' Here is the path to the solution to the problem . ' But it 's characteristic of this problem that thoughtful people do n't know the answer yet . " To invest so much energy and hope in campaigns for a freeze , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are those who say the whole house of cards will fall into place once we have a freeze . That is clearly not true . "
