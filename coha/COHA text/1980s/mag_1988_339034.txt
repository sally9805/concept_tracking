Sometimes the history of a place is best told through the history of a remarkable man . Jiri Ruml is such a man . Twenty years ago this month , Moscow dispatched Warsaw Pact troops to Czechoslovakia to crush a budding reform movement , a brutal act that plunged the country into a dark winter of repression from which it is only now emerging . Ruml , a journalist in Prague , was fired , but that was merely the beginning of his troubles . Senior Correspondent Frederick Ungeheuer , who covered the invasion for TIME , knew Ruml well . This month he returned to Prague to find out how his friend has fared over the past two decades . His report : <P> Aug. 30 , 1968 . Soviet tanks are parked near Prague 's Old Town Square , ready to disperse the young people gathered around the mournful statue of Jan Hus , the 15th century religious reformer who was burned at the stake as a heretic . Looking down on the tanks from his third-floor office on Parizska ( Paris Street ) , Jiri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt at reform will have to come from the center , from Moscow . " <P> As deputy editor of an irreverent weekly called the Reporter , Ruml , then 44 , had chronicled the student protests that set the stage for the extraordinary reform movement known as the Prague Spring . He reported on the enthusiasm that Party Leader Alexander Dubcek 's vision of " socialism with a human face " had aroused among factory workers , and wrote scathing pieces about the ominous Warsaw Pact army maneuvers taking place in Czechoslovakia that summer . On Aug. 21 , those exercises had turned into a full-scale invasion . <P> When I saw Ruml again , two years later , the " Brezhnev winter " had descended on Prague . Ruml , along with 3,000 other journalists , had lost his job and been expelled from the Communist Party . His new career : working as a crane operator with a road gang . Ruml 's wife Jirina Hrabkova had been removed as the moderator of a popular radio program , and was selling sausages at the Prague Zoo . Worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jakob , 15 , were hounded out of high school and denied a university education . <P> This time , after not having seen my friend for 18 years , I barely recognized him . He stood in the doorway of his two-room apartment in a sooty housing project . He looked frail , his thin face tanned but deeply furrowed . But his blue-gray eyes still sparkled . On a small table in the corner stood a typewriter . " It is the fifth in 20 years , " he said . The police had confiscated the others in attempts to trace samizdat ( underground press ) articles critical of the regime . The harassment had brought on an ulcer complicated by other stomach ailments . After multiple surgery in 1980 , Ruml was declared an invalid and retired with a monthly pension of $200 . <P> " Only then , the real dance began , " he recalls . In 1977 his family had signed Charter 77 , a petition that called on the Prague government to observe the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights . Within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning . Ruml was frequently picked up by the police in the years that followed , and in April 1981 he and his son Jan were accused of organizing subversive activities , an offense that carries a ten-year jail term . They were kept in different parts of a Prague prison , seeing each other only once in 13 months . In 1982 Ruml and his son were released , but the charges are still pending .
