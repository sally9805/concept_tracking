Colorado 's Governor causes a furor on the issue of dying <P> The words seemed calculated to provoke an uproar . Elderly people who are terminally ill " have a duty to die , " declared Colorado Governor Richard Lamm , 48 , at a meeting of the Colorado Health Lawyers Association last week in Denver . " Like leaves which fall off a tree forming the humus in which other plants can grow , we 've got a duty to die and get out of the way with all of our machines and artificial hearts , so that our kids can build a reasonable life . " <P> An uproar is just what the Governor got . In Washington the American Life Lobby , an antiabortion , anti-euthanasia group , quickly called for Lamm 's resignation . Florida 's Representative Claude Pepper , 83 , Congress 's leading advocate for the aged , accused the Governor of " downgrading the elderly . " Lamm was confronted by angry older citizens in Denver . " I used to think the world of you , but I hate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 76 . <P> Lost in the ruckus was Lamm 's original intent : to call attention to the alarming fact that " medical science is replacing God in deciding when we die , " and to encourage discussion of the implications . " We can prolong our lives a few months or a year , but at what price ? " Lamm asks . The Governor insists that he did not intend to endorse mercy killing : " In euthanasia , somebody else makes the decision . am merely saying people have the right : o die without medical science intervenng . " In addition , he notes , the " falling leaves " metaphor was an attempt to paraphrase an article in the American Scholar by University of Chicago Philosopher Leon Kass : " It was unfortunate that it suddenly became my quote . " <P> However infelicitous his phrasing , Lamm was praised in some quarters for broaching one of the most sensitive issues of the day . Medical technology has become increasingly successful at keeping frail and withered leaves on the tree long after nature would have let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals or nursing homes , generally in the course of receiving some sort of medical treatment . Doctors no longer speak of death by " natural causes . " Because physicians have the capacity to extend life , they often feel obliged to use it , observes Dr. Bernard Towers , who helps direct a U.C.L.A. program for the study of medicine , law and human values . " Most people fear dying in the midst of electronic gadgetry , " he says , " but it looks like there may come a time when we will not be allowed to die without an I.V . tube running .
