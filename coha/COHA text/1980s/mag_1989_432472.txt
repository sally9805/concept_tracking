 | Seven fishermen stand , mending their nets , inside the seawall of Suttsu , a small village on the coast of Hokkaido in Japan 's far north . They look up as their congressman , Shizuo Sato , steps over a rope and greets them . " I 'm rallying support for the Liberal Democratic Party , " he says . " We 're in a tight spot . " The grizzled fishermen are anything but awed by the encounter . " You guys brought it on yourselves with that new tax , " says one . Another , gold teeth lighting up his grin , adds , " All those guys at the top are thieves . " Says a third , to guffaws , " If a man pays 300,000 yen a month for a woman , he ought to be more careful . " The fishermen are all smiling , but like the salt in the wind off the Sea of Japan , there 's an edge to their banter . Like many Japanese , they 're mad as hell at Sato 's LDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Sunday they just may vote to throw the rascals out in elections for the upper house of Japan 's parliament . The vote is a crucial test of the depth of voter anger . If the LDP takes a beating in the contest for the less important upper house in Japan 's bicameral Diet , it could foretell a similar loss in the lower house , where Shizuo Sato sits and laws are really made . That election is expected to be called for October or November . One measure of the near panic gripping LDP leaders is a suggestion that the party might voluntarily turn the government over to the Socialists , without a lowerhouse election , in hopes that the experience would expose opposition shortcomings and scare the voters . The LDP is on the run , precisely for the reasons cited by the fishermen . In April , it ramrodded a 3 percent consumption tax through the Diet that hikes the price of food and other daily needs , angering housewives and shopkeepers . The party already had been deeply wounded by the Recruit influence-peddling scandal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takeshita from office in May . The final straw for many voters , especially women , came with disclosures that Takeshita 's successor , Sosuke Uno , had extramarital affairs with as many as seven women , including one self-styled geisha who said Uno paid her 300,000 yen ( $2,140 ) a month . Recent opposition victories in regional by-elections and for the Tokyo Municipal Assembly underlined that disenchantment . Clearly , a defeat of the party that has ruled Japan uninterrupted since 1955 would hit hard at U.S. interests . The Socialists have long been critical of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and of the important U.S. military bases on Japanese soil . They could make delicate negotiations on trade matters even more difficult . But , like it or not , the United States must brace for the unthinkable . " Never in the postwar era have we sensed such a strong current of change in Japanese politics as we are registering now , " declared a recent editorial in the Asahi Shimbun , a leading national daily . Despite all the trouble facing the LDP , Japanese voters remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a yen , and the opposition parties are mired as ever in the ideological swamps , their only selling point the fact that they are not the LDP . Moreover , the LDP is fighting for its life , and , after four decades of pork-barrel politics , it certainly knows how to deliver the goodies . Turning the tide . Shizuo Sato , 47 , is counting on that political savvy and his own hard work to help turn back the anti-LDP tide . A lower-house member from Hokkaido 's huge first district , he has forged an impressive record for a first termer . He serves on key committees , including defense and political reform , and so far he has escaped any taint Personal politics . Diet member Sato , right , from the scandals rocking his party . Sato is a student of American-style campaign financing and last year hired a young American graduate of the University of Arizona , Chris Redl , to help him . Sato 's early life prepared him for the political grind . His father died when he was 5 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in a steel mill , an insurance firm and , in his first taste of politics , a local LDP office . His big break came in 1966 when he went to work for former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda , one of Japan 's shrewdest poll . After eight years with Fukuda , he was elected to Hokkaido 's local assembly . Somewhere along the way , like American Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater , he learned to pick a mean guitar . Sato lost his first bid for the lower house in 1983 but came back to win three years later . Tip O'Neill 's dictum that all politics is local is translated differently in Japan . Here , all politics is personal . Issues are paid lip service , but the political glue in Japan is the bow , the handshake , the few words that pass between a candidate and a voter . No Japanese politician relies on television or print ads to spread his campaign message . He must show sincerity by showing his face . The upshot for Shizuo Sato is an end- less run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch every one of the 1.6 million voters in his district . It 's impossible , of course , and the effort taxes even a burly 6-footer who lifts weights to stay in shape . Sato averages 43,000 air miles ( Hokkaido is 600 miles north of Tokyo ) and 13,000 land miles a year , keeping up his fences . The drill is essential : If he does n't do it , he will lose . And Sato hates losing . Sato 's take-home pay , after a 50 percent tax bite , is $42,850 a year , half of which goes toward staff and office expenses in his home district . The government pays for only two of his 15 staffers and none of his travel , telephone , mail and district-office expenses . Since 1976 and the Lockheed bribery scandal , Japan has had a 1.5 million-yen ( $11,000 ) ceiling on personal and corporate campaign contributions . But there is a loophole . At the heart of all Japanese campaigns are the koenkai , or supporters groups . They are an amalgam of big-city machine , political-action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members in each group . Koenkai members maximize contributions , buy tickets to fund-raisers and provide free services that keep costs down . Sato has 250 personal koenkai in his huge district , many dating back to the 1970s . They encompass potato farmers and dairymen , nuclear-power-plant operators and ski-resort owners as well as construction-company owners who expect Sato to funnel public-works projects their way . A recent campaign swing with Sato shows the frenetic pace of politics , Japanese style . Sunday : After a daylong round of strategic planning with his staff , Sato attends a reception for 100 retired military men at Sapporo 's Emperor Club . Sato warns the veterans that an opposition victory means defense-budget cuts , even for " you reservists . " He calls up Chris Redl to join him in a duet of " You Are My Sunshine . " Afterward , at a Korean restaurant , Sato steals an hour or so with his family ? wife Midori , her mother , and three sons , Shinichiro , 16 ; Seiichiro , 14 , and Soichiro , 12 . The eldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sheffield , Mass. , where he learned about heavymetal rock groups Def Leppard and White Snake . Asked about the large responsibilities that the oldest son must bear in Japan , Shinichiro says , " It sucks . " Monday : After breakfast , Sato visits the Sapporo headquarters of an LDP upperhouse candidate , who is trailing in the polls . Told that the office does n't open until 8 a.m. , Sato growls , " How can you win that way ? You should start at 6 . " Then it 's a 2-hour dash by car to his hometown of Kutchan . Zipping past potato fields , rice paddies and twin-siloed farms , Sato points out Niseko , his birthplace , which now boasts one of Japan 's prime ski slopes . In Kutchan , population 19,000 , Sato catches up with his wife and casts an absentee ballot , since he 'll be on the road on Election Day . Then they hurry to his local office , located in their modest home . Aside from 17 calligraphy brushes hanging on one wall , the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fax , computer , cluttered desks and photos of Sato with assorted big shots . His favorite slogan , in English , decorates a wall banner : " You Never Fail Until You Stop Trying . " Try he does , heading out to call at 27 businesses ranging from car dealerships to a farm-implement store . The moves are well honed : Sato leaps out to schmooze with the boss while his aides slip brochures onto each desk and , if permitted , tack up a Sato poster . At a toilet-paper plant Sato , dashing across an assembly line , narrowly misses an ignominious collision with an onrushing , uncut 8-foot-long roll of tissue . Issues are not discussed . The drill is to show his face , press the flesh , ask earnest questions about welding or tractors . Lat- er , Sato tours other local LDP campaign offices . One worker asks if Sato 's koenkai might support his candidate . Sato laterals , asking an aide to deal with the request later . The Japanese for this pocket veto is mokusatsu , or killing with silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ koenkai leaders . Sitting around the table are a forest ranger , a tax collector and some teachers . Sato fries mushrooms while his wife cooks steak . The atmosphere is relaxed ; Sato pulls out his Martin guitar and unlimbers a passable tenor on " Your Cheatin ' Heart . " Tuesday : The two-car caravan makes the run to the coast . After taking heat from the fishermen , Sato heads on into Suttsu , a port town of 2,500 . This is the other Japan , as different from glitzy Tokyo as Coos Bay , Oreg. , is from New York . Suttsu has two pay phones , gravity toilets , squid drying like socks on a line and open-front shops that sell fishing nets . " If you pay attention only to the larger towns , it can come back to haunt you , " Sato explains . At one meeting , Sato tries to address national issues like the new tax , but during question time , he gets an earful about road problems , the shortage of local doctors and the need for an airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lunch is served in a supporter 's seaside restaurant , featuring a special dish of raw sea urchins so fresh their spines are still waving while the diners spoon out the innards . Three more koenkai sessions . That night , up the coast in Shimamaki , koenkai leaders assemble 250 people . Sato , " the man who brought in all that construction work , " warns that there 's a good chance the opposition will take over . If they do , he says , they wo n't fund next year 's elaborate memorial service for the late Emperor Hirohito . Sato and the LDP seem determined to ignore the new interest of women in politics . He claims that for 80 percent of Japanese women " their children are the main priority . " He rushes off for curry rice and beer with eight local koenkai chiefs . It is 9 p.m. and an hour 's drive through rain to get home . In the car , he unwinds and answers questions . Yes , of course , he wants to be Prime Minister someday , but first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the scandals . Yes , of course , he is road weary , but he has a responsibility to the people . Can he stay clean ? Sato pauses . The only sounds are the tires hissing on wet pavement , the wipers metronoming , the croaking of armies of frogs in the paddies . Shizuo Sato sighs . " When you 're doing 70 in a 65-mile zone , the police wo n't stop you . The way I run my politics is at 70. "
