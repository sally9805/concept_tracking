" Do n't put the earth upside down , " warns Mark Petricone as his 13 students struggle with coat hangers and pliers . " And remember , folks , the earth is n't really in the middle of the universe . This is an incorrect scale model , but astronomers have been using it for a couple of thousand years . " <P> The goal for the juniors and seniors at Watertown High in Watertown , Mass. , is to mount a thimble-size metal earth on a coat hanger in the middle of a melon-size clear-plastic sphere that is supposed to be the universe . The students then use Magic Markers to trace onto the universe a computer-drawn map of a few hundred of the brightest stars in the night sky . They draw a line around the sphere to represent the ecliptic , or path of the sun through the constellations , and then they are ready for some gnarly astronomy . <P> Like the universe , Petricone 's classroom is a study in controlled chaos . " Are the Pleiades part of Taurus ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David explains the difference between a crescent and a gibbous moon  --  a waxing gibbous , at that . Barry Lyons solves the mystery of the moon 's phases for a visitor by drawing an impromptu diagram . " What was the moon last night ? " Petricone bellows . " A waxing crescent , " Karyn Woodbury shoots back as she assembles her celestial sphere . " What about tonight ? " Petricone pushes . " A first quarter , " pipes another voice . <P> This is classic instruction for Project STAR ( Science Teaching Through Its Astronomical Roots ) , a program taught in 18 schools in 13 states . STAR is based on the premise that books are abysmal tools for learning science . " It 's impossible to understand an astronomy diagram without using three dimensions at proper scale , " says Irwin Shapiro , the irrepressible director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass. , and the man who dreamed up STAR six years ago . " High school science textbooks are impossible . They are dense with concepts and jargon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth Mirvis , who writes STAR course materials : " This is not a curriculum of vocabulary but of concepts . " And , explains Shapiro , " facts are easy ; concepts are hard . " <P> In his years at Harvard and M.I.T. , Shapiro has been struck by the difficulty even well-educated adults have with basic scientific concepts . Last year he and some colleagues produced a half-hour film titled A Private Universe in which half a dozen Harvard seniors were asked on graduation day to explain why there are seasons . All blithely described how the earth is closer to the sun in summer and farther away in winter . Wrong . The seasons result from the tilt of the earth 's axis relative to its orbit . When the sun is highest in the sky , we have summer . In fact , the earth is closest to the sun in January . <P> Through Project STAR , which received $833,000 in seed money from the National Science Foundation in 1985 , Shapiro hopes to correct such misunderstandings . The goal of the program is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use astronomical examples to instill basic concepts of math and science . Thus students may master the inverse-square law of physics by seeing that when a star doubles its distance from a certain point , it becomes one-quarter as bright . Why choose astronomy for this purpose ? " It 's not as abstract as chemistry and physics , " says Shapiro , " and the sky is always there . "
