The year is 1866 , and an English governess consigned to doleful duty in a remote Australian backwater has her thoughts interrupted by a preposterous vision : " She was running through her list of unsatisfactory or irritating or boorish suitors when she saw a church made from glass towed into her field of vision by two men in wide straw hats . " This is no hallucination . The crystalline minicathedral that floats into view , with a framework of iron , measures 50 ft. in length and 22 ft. 6 in. across . It weighs twelve tons . <P> By the time the governess beholds the church , Australian Author Peter Carey 's third novel has begun to build to a spectacular finish . But none of the surprises to come are any more outlandish than the trail of circumstances and coincidences that have led up to them . Like the glass structure it celebrates , Oscar and Lucinda seems the stuff of shimmering , transparent fantasy , held together by the struts of 19th century history and the mullions of painstaking detail . The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will seem substantial enough to readers unable to put it down . <P> Carey 's title provides an answer to the first and most obvious question : Who on earth would go to the considerable trouble of making a glass church materialize in the Australian outback ? Why , Oscar and Lucinda , naturally . But who are ( or were ) they , what brought them together , and why did they conceive such a pointless , improbable dream ? Explanations , as the author supplies them , grow ever less simple and more entertaining . <P> Oscar , for openers , is the sole surviving child of a widower named Theophilus Hopkins , a naturalist renowned for his studies along the rugged English coast of Devon and a fire-breathing evangelical preacher . The lad eventually tastes a Christmas pudding , strictly forbidden by his father 's severe regimen , is punished and rebels .

" Oscar 's financial salvation comes when a well-to-do classmate looking for company knocks on his door by accident and then remarks , " I say , Odd Bod , do you like a flutter ? " Slowly , Oscar realizes that he is being invited to bet on horses at Epsom Downs . He would indeed like a flutter : " He knew that God would give him money at the races . " <P> While Oscar is successfully mastering and profiting from the odds , half a world away Lucinda Leplastrier finds herself orphaned in New South Wales . Her parents ' experimental farm has been subdivided and sold by her legal guardian , leaving her with an inheritance of more than ( pounds ) 10,000 and the freedom to move to the colonial metropolis of Sydney , where she buys one of the first things she sees , the Prince Rupert 's Glassworks . Lucinda 's purchase is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glass , with the conviction " that it is invisible , solid , in short , a joyous and paradoxical thing , as good a material as any to build a life from .
