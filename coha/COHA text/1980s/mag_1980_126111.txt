When the owners of the 24 NASL teams meet in Chicago on Dec. 1 , the atmosphere in the O'Hare Hilton will be distinctly gloomy . For a change , the league 's VIPs wo n't be hearing any talk of blue skies and rosy futures from Commissioner Phil Woosnam . No onward and upward message this time . The mood of uncertainty included the question of whether Board Chairman Henry Kissinger would show up . The fact is that the league is taking a pounding such as it has never experienced in a decade of heady expansion . The pounders include a militant union , a federal court , the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and a television network . The ledger books reveal an absolute torrent of red ink . Before the Chicago meetings are over , two and perhaps three teams will have been swept away . // Every one of the 24 franchises is believed to have lost money this year , with the across-the-league deficit amounting to about $30 million . Although attendance was up 7% over 1979 ( to 6,196,000 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the league had shrunk to five teams and no one thought it would survive . Is the situation really that bleak ? Well , the league will survive  --  but there will be scars. // The biggest crack in the league 's image and credibility may become visible as early as the first day of the meetings , at which time the Madison Square Garden Corporation ( which is owned by Gulf &amp; Western ) is expected to return its certificate of ownership of the Washington Diplomats to Woosnam . When a well-heeled , corporate-backed club in a prestigious city decides to fold , that 's trouble . Although Washington is a potentially lucrative market  --  and average attendance rose to 19,204 last summer from 11,973 in 1979  --  the franchise has lost $2 ? million in the two years MSG has owned it . MSG President Sonny Werblin cites the recession , bigger operating expenses and a geometrical leap in acquisition costs and salaries for players . Dutch star Johan Cruyff , a big gate attraction , alone commands $500,000 per year . // Neither the Houston Hurricane nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the NASL . They face an " Involuntary Termination " hearing in Chicago . " We could n't go on much longer , anyway , " says Lancer President Pat Dinolfo . A deal to sell the Hurricane to investors assembled by the California-based Athletes In Action , a religious group , fell through , and Houston 's fate is expected to be the same as Rochester's. // Nor could what happened to the Minnesota Kicks in the off-season give the owners much cause for cheer . For years during the league 's upward surge , the Kicks , owned and vigorously promoted by a group of Minnesota food executives , were one of NASL 's showcase teams , successful on the field and second only to the Cosmos in attendance . But last season the team sagged , and so did attendance ; three weeks ago the Minnesotans sold out , and the Kicks are now owned by a British group . // And the NASL 's relocation game has resumed . The Memphis Rogues are now the Calgary Boomers , owned by Nelson Skalbania , the Canadian sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Molson Brewery as its new proprietor . And Lipton 's Teamen , unable to settle scheduling and parking disputes with Schaefer Stadium in Foxboro , Mass. , have become the Jacksonville , Fla . Teamen. // The net effect of these failures and transfers is to leave the league with only two teams , Atlanta and the Cosmos , the latter perched outside New York in the New Jersey Meadowlands , on the East Coast between Montreal and Jacksonville  --  a truly gigantic void . // But embattled owners are adamant about cutting their losses and regrouping . Clive Toye is president of the Toronto Blizzard and has been a pal of Woosnam 's from early NASL days . " It 's not like 1969 , when no owner had success or saw any hope , " he says . " Now we 've gained a beachhead , but it 's a tangled one . To put it simply , we bit off more than we could chew when we expanded from 18 to 24 teams in 1977 . We all spent too much on players without a parallel jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're paying the price now . The price is contraction . " // The tide of owner opinion has now turned against weak sisters . Bob Bell is a commodities broker who has poured $5 million into the San Diego Sockers in the past two years . " It 's sink or swim . We 're not a socialist group , we 're businessmen , " he says . " If an owner ca n't make it , we wo n't go to the well for him any longer . " Jack Daley , president of the Seattle Sounders , is equally hard-nosed . " After the novelty of owning a sports team wears off , it 's a bottom-line business , " he says . " If your car dealership fails , you close up . It 's the same in the NASL now . " // Somewhat surprisingly under the circumstances , the league 's many problems have n't produced a coherent anti-Woosnam movement . The Welsh-born commissioner , who was the eloquent apostle of expansion , has been regarded as vulnerable to a **41;636;TOOLONG attack . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insiders believe that Woosnam is sufficiently sensitive to the owners ' new mood to turn from super-salesmanship to retrenchment . Says one owner , " Phil 's duties will be changing . He 'll be a consolidator , not a front man . " // In his New York office Woosnam broods , but because it 's his nature to do so , he broods optimistically . " We 're not an automatic success story , " he says . " But it took the NFL 40 years to get to where it was in 1960 , which is about our level now . We 've done it in 14 years . This , however , is the year of realism . The phrase is steady and slower . " // Compared to the basic cashbox problem , Woosnam 's other difficulties are less daunting . Take the labor dispute . The NASL Players ' Association recently forced the league to the bargaining table after almost three years in which the league refused to recognize the union . Talks promptly broke down , and the union asserted that the owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the items in dispute was payment for players in the NASL 's projected indoor season , the union asked a federal court to enjoin the league from going ahead with it . Although the judge issued the injunction , the league started indoor play anyway . In light of the judge 's decision and because of the potential involvement of foreign players in the dispute , Immigration authorities barred them from crossing the border into the U.S. , the theory being that because legally there were no games , the players would have no jobs , a requirement for admission to the country . With four Canadian sides in the 19-team indoor season , the border closing wrought havoc . For example , on Nov. 14 , the opening day 's Edmonton at San Jose game became Los Angeles at San Jose . // Nevertheless , both sides hope that the problem will soon be resolved . " There 's light at the end of the tunnel , " says Howard Wilson , an NASLPA aide . Woosnam says that 30 major issues have come down to " a handful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . It 's all very positive . " // Whatever the eventual settlement , it is n't likely to affect the NASL 's odd salary structure or the level of pay . In the NFL , 40% of an average team 's budget goes to pay player salaries . In the NASL , the figure is more than 70% . Many owners point the finger of responsibility at the Cosmos and Warner Communications , their owner . " I have an affectionate dislike for the Cosmos ' operation , " says San Diego 's Bell . " They go into a foreign country and pay , say , $500,000 for a player . I have to go in there next  --  and I ca n't afford it . " // But with major North American corporations controlling not only the Cosmos but also teams in Toronto , Portland , Montreal , Jacksonville and Los Angeles , the little guys likely will have to go on pinching pennies and egos . In all sports , owners grouse about another team buying a championship , but one NASL man probably spoke for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buying themselves out of the league . Who can play with them ? " // For its part , ABC-TV seems ready to deliver a blow to the league 's image . Ratings for the six games , including the Soccer Bowl , aired last summer , averaged out to a dismal 2.6 market share . ABC 's contract has expired . Around the league it 's believed the network will televise only the Soccer Bowl and perhaps one playoff game next season . But an ABC official says , " I would n't go that far yet . Nothing 's settled . " The loss of TV exposure would hurt the league 's pride but hardly its pocketbook . Last season 's contract meant a mere $27,000 to each NASL club  --  a cup of coffee compared to the $5.3 million feast that TV will confer upon each NFL team this year . // The NASL has always drooled at the bounty that comes with being an established major sport . But the rainbow seems to be a little longer now , the pot farther away .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
