" Well , it 's about time , " Katharine Hepburn told Henry Fonda , upon meeting him last summer to film On Golden Pond . Despite nearly a century of cinema experience between them , Hepburn , 71 , and Fonda , 75 , had never collaborated before . Now , says Fonda , " Katharine is one of my favorite leading ladies . Her instincts are perfect . " But not according to veteran Critic Helen Lawrenson . In an acid-etched piece in Dial magazine , Lawrenson dismisses the notion that Katharine is great as " twaddle . " Hepburn 's 1967 and ' 68 Oscars , says Lawrenson , " must have been for longevity . " Kate 's chief assets , she continues , are " photogenic bone structure , approximately two facial expressions " and a voice as " implacable as a dental drill . " This , retorts Fonda , " is a crock , " but Hepburn remains unperturbed . " I have n't read it . I only want to hear lovely things . " <P> She was found last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malnourished-and not knowing who she was . Florida doctors have since restored her health , but not her memory .

" Her nervous appeal , on Good Morning America , brought more than 500 inquiries to the Ft . Lauderdale police department from families searching for missing relatives . At week 's end , detectives were pursuing a handful of leads . <P> Baring her soul was just a first step for Rita Jenrette , 31 , estranged wife of ex-Congressman and convicted Abscam influence peddler John Jenrette , 44 . Last December , Rita shocked Washington and her own husband by publishing a " diary " detailing the drinking , mating and drug-taking habits of Congress . Now , in the April Playboy , she bares her corporeal self . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers the ten-page color spread " my way of purging the last political demons from my life . " Rita 's most titillating revelation : during one late-night House session John " led me into the shadows of the U.S. Capitol and we made love on the marble steps that overlook the monuments . " Knowing that his wife was telling all in Playboy , Jenrette broke the story first , noting : " It 's something I 'd always wanted to do . "
