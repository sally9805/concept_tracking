Iran announced yesterday that it will go before the UN Security Council in an attempt to show that Iraq is the aggressor in the war between the two Persian Gulf nations . UN Secretary General Kurt Waldheim , meanwhile , issued a call for a cease-fire in the Shatt al-Arab waterway leading to the gulf . Iran ' s special envoy to the United Nations , Ali Shams Ardakani , said his nation would take its complaint of Iraqi aggression to the council , but was not ready to discuss the 52 American hostages held in Iran since Nov. 4 . Until now , Iran has been reluctant to turn to the Security Council to try to gain international support , because it has ignored repeated calls by the 15-member body to release the hostages . Waldheim asked Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for a cease-fire in the Shatt al-Arab to safeguard international shipping . Waldheim ' s spokesman , Francois Giuliani , announced the move after Waldheim met with Ardakani . Giuliani said Waldheim sent messages to both nations ' leaders " asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful shipping in the conflict area - that is , the Shatt al-Arab area . " The waterway , which is the disputed frontier between the two nations , has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the war . Ardakani said Iran would " definitely go to the Security Council . " He said that he would file a complaint of aggression and that a delegation would comefrom Tehran to take part in the council session . In Iran , Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai was quoted by Tehran Radio as saying his nation would take part in the council meeting " as a wronged party , as a party subjected to aggression , so as to show the ugly face of this infidel oppressor ( Iraq ) to the world . " The council later went into private session to discuss what to do to follow up its unanimous Sept. 28 resolution calling on Iran and Iraq to stop fighting . After that resolution was passed , Iraq unilaterally declared a cease-fire , on the condition that Iran would stop shooting , too , but Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters that , in his message to the two presidents , Waldheim asked " that , as a first step , immediate measures should be taken toallow ships that are now immobilized in the area to leave safely . " The spokesman added : " In this message , the secretary general also pointed out that he understands the difficulties of making such an arrangement toallow the ships to leave the area in a conflict situation . " But he notes that in recent days there have been many casualties and damage incurred . . . a result of the hostilities between Iraq and Iran . " He therefore asks the presidents to make suggestions to him immediately as to the modalities that would enable the ships to leave the area and , of course , among those modalities there would have to be a local cease-fire . " The secretary general has offered his good offices to both parties to assist in making the arrangements and , in view of the international concern about this particular problem , he asks for a positive and early response to his appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
