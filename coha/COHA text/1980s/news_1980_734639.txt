txt A federal judge 's ruling against President Carter 's oil-import fee of $4.62 a barrel comes as no surprise . The chief executive has the power , earlier granted by Congress , to restrict imports through the imposition of a tariff , which Congress may then overrule if it chooses . But , with the best of energy conservalion intentions , the President tried to go further and exercise an authority Congress may not have granted him . He said the fee or tariff would have to show up as a 10-cent a gallon surcharge on all gasoline sold at the pump , whether refined from foreign or domestic oil . That turns the tariff into a domestic tax , which only Congress has the power to levy . Had the President let the tariff show up as an increased price for all products made from imported oil , there would have been no apparent violation of the law . But the politics of the situation precluded that . since any increase in the price of home-heating oil would have incurred the wrath of its principal users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Con-gross ) , The irony is that these people were up in arms anyway , since they believed there was no way , regardless of the intent of the Presidential order , to prevent the tariff from showing up as an increase in the price of heating oil as well as of gasoline . The administration may have believed that putting all of the tariff 's tax load on gasoline would result in more conservation than would be the case if the tax were spread more thinly among all oil products . But Mr. Carter was also sure that Congress would not go along with a straightforward tax on gasoline ? at least pot in an election year . So he resorted to a gasoline tax in disguise through the subterfuge of an import tariff effected by way of an executive order . Of course , other industrial democracies have managed to find a political consensus for restricting demand for gasoline through far heavier taxation of gasoline than the 10 cents a gallon in the Carter executive order . They have managed to get the idea across that this is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as has so often been the case , was admirable , But his means of attaining it seem once again to have fallen short .
