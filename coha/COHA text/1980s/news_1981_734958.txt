txt YOU DO N'T HAVE to be WA to afford an architect . At least two Chicago organizations offering low-priced , and sometimes free , chiteetural help for lower-income people . Ona organization , the Chicago Arcintecturai Assistance Center , ( CAAC ) , sets a maximum eligible income at $19,000 for a gamily with six or. , more scaled down to $12,000 for'ittingle person . If you make less thin that , Yitu Piiy lest . People-with extremely low incomes pay nothing , said John Tomassi , executive de/actor . A Client must show that he or she can afford to carry out the project , said Tomassi . THE OTHER organization , Arc Rehab Corp. , ' has no specific income limits , but aiMs ? at people-whose income falls between what the government considers low income and those who can afford a regular architect , said ctifounder Noelle Owens . " We do n't ask how much you make . If people can afford to pay a little more , we ask for more . We take into account the number , of kids they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or an elderly mother . " A lot of people just need somebodY tarchitee tura* qualified ) to answer a few , questions . But just to have somebody answer a few questions can cost a lot of money these days , " said Owens . Are Rehab usually charges $8 to $8 an hour , she said . , , aA ) wens said she could think of only ohe inst- nCe where a client turned out to be wealthier than the income group Arc Rehab aims to help . 4. rn the course of discussing the architectural work to be done , the client mentioned that she owned two other buildings , said Owens . " We let It drop , " she said . BOTH ' ORGANIZATIONS , and CAAC in. particular , do work for neighborhood organizations and people who have obtained financing at lower-than-market rates through government programs . But they 're also willing to work for any ifidividual who wants to rehabilitate his home , pull down some interior walls , build an addition ' to a room , . or fix up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner occupies one unit , are eligible for both pro- grams . And it 's surprising how many owners of such buildings fall within the income qualifications , said Tomassi . " We do a lot of that kind of work . If someone has a code problem with a three-flat , they need an architect to prepare drawings , Some of the buildings are in severely depressed areas , and the rents are not high at all . They might be old ladies whose husbands have died , and they 've owned the property for 20 or 30 years . They 're not on high incomes , " he said . The CAAC works only on buildings within the city , but Arc Rehab will take on jobs anywhere in the Chicago area . Both have done most of their work in the city 's low-income neighborhoods , although Arc Rehab 's current job list includes the conversion , of several Evanston buildings to the use of passive solar energy , in cooperation with Urban Ark , arc energy conservation eo ; op there . The CAAC excludes small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community service facility , such as a day care center , said Tomassi , ARC REHAB , on the other hand , ' has done several commercial jobs . ' ! ' You think if someone owns their own business they 're going to have more money . But a lot of times they do n't . They 're struggling along the same as everyone else , " said Owens . She lists renovation of a couple of small bars and work for the Fifth City Community Center , where Arc Rehab has its offices , among nonresidential jobs . The Fifth City work has included designs for a preschool project and a commercial school , in exchange for Arc Rehab 's office rent , she said . An important part of the help that both organizations offer is to give clients an idea of how much a project will cost , and then draw up specifications that the clients can take to contractors for price quotes . DESPITE THE similarities in services , the two organizations are somewhat different in nature . The CAAC. was founded in 1974 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now independent . It receives some public funding and has grants from about 12 private foundations , as well as donations from architects collected through the American Institute of Architects , said Tomassi . Arc Rehab was founded just last year by three students at Illinois Institute of Technology 's architecture school . SO FAR , Arc Rehab has been unsuccessful In its attempts to get private or public funding , largely because donors are concerned the nonprofit corporation might close down when the students graduate , said Owens . Both she and cofounder Bram Fine plan to stay on after ' graduation , however , hiring future students to help them . While Tomassi at CAAC is a fully qualified architect , none of the staffers at Arc Rehab has that qualification yet . But all their work is checked out and given a final stamp of approval by registered architect James Schriner , said Owens .
