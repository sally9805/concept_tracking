The Killing Fields , Birdy , The Falcon and the Snowman , Witness : all films acutely concerned with a crisis in American values , and all directed by " foreigners . " Be it Sunrise or The Best Years of Our Lives , Fury or Flashdance , Hollywood movies have seen their energy and conscience reflected through the fond , critical eyes of European directors . Be grateful to these immigrant artists ; they are among the last adventurers into the dark , hard regions of the American soul . <P> It is a troubled , divided soul that French Director Louis Malle ( The Lovers , Murmur of the Heart ) uncovers in Alamo Bay . The script is based on a conflict that exploded in the late ' 70s on the Texas Gulf Coast . In the film town of Port Alamo , " Anglo " shrimp fishermen battle the current , the depressed prices and the influx of Vietnamese refugees plying an old trade in a new land .

Dinh ( Ho Nguyen ) is a bright , ambitious immigrant who wants a chance to make a living in Port Alamo , whatever the odds . " You got ta be one of the last cowboys left in Texas , " Dinh is told by Shang 's lady friend Glory ( Amy Madigan ) , who finds her loyalties stretched tight . There is no easy , noble way out of this dilemma . No one can win . No one is wrong until things turn violent , when the good ole boys put on T shirts reading SECRET MEMBER , KU KLUX KLAN and try to blow these new boat people out of the water . It is as if both sides were waging a stupid , losing war all over again . <P> Screenwriter Arlen has a fine ear for Texas cadences : " Darlin ' , these biscuits are old enough to vote .

The script would have been even stronger if Dinh had been allowed some convulsive ambiguities of his own . Instead , he must simply endure , selfless and sexless . Such is the yellow man 's burden in films of the liberal persuasion . <P> In Malle , who brought sympathetic candor to Pretty Baby and Atlantic City , his earlier portraits of American dreamers lost in transit , Arlen has a director almost too alive to nuance . The film has a very long fuse ; for its first hour it meanders down familiar folkloric byways . It will stop to admire the sight of a Texas fishing boat cutting through the muddy water and purple sky , or linger over the electric heat in the slow dance of Madigan and Harris before their ideals fatally collide . But once it gets going , Alamo Bay delivers its argument with rigor and passion . <P> Shooting around Rockport , Texas , Malle must have realized that he too was an alien intruder  --  a rich Frenchman with a glamorous wife ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this foreigner was the right person to tell this abrasive story , and to capture it in warm colors and cold blood .
