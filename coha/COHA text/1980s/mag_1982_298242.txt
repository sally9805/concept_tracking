Lebanon 's crisis has made Gaddafi fume at almost everyone <P> Israel 's blitz into Lebanon and its brutal stranglehold on Beirut have aroused doubt , controversy , criticism and apprehension in the U.S. and within Israel itself . But one side effect of the episode is likely to be received as good news in both Washington and Jerusalem . Whatever damage it has done to the long-term interests of the U.S. and Israel , the crisis already seems to have increased the isolation of Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi . <P> Gaddafi has close military ties to the Soviet Union , a propensity for sending expeditionary forces elsewhere in Africa ( to Uganda and Chad , for example ) , and an undisguised ambition to radicalize such Third World bodies as the Organization of African Unity and the nonaligned movement . He is , therefore , pre-eminent in the demonology of the Reagan Administration . In a number of offices at the CIA , Gaddafi 's picture hangs next to those of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev and Cuban President Fidel Castro in a kind of unholy trinity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first among equals , our international public enemy No. 1 . " The Reagan Administration blames Gaddafi for sponsoring international terrorism ( he says he supports only legitimate liberation movements ) , and even for dispatching hit squads to assassinate the President and other public figures ( a charge that Gaddafi flatly denied , and one that seems to have faded for lack of firm evidence ) . Gaddafi is the only foreign leader whose forces have engaged the U.S. in armed combat during the present Administration ( the dogfight in the Gulf of Sidra last August ) . <P> But the greatest fear of American policymakers has been that the Arab-Israeli conflict would gradually , or perhaps suddenly , drive other , traditionally moderate Arabs toward Gaddafi 's militant banner . U.S. officials are concerned that Gaddafi-ism , as his brand of uncompromising opposition to the existence of any Jewish state in the area is sometimes called , will spread , and along with it his influence . <P> That nightmare seems , so far at least , not to be coming true . On the contrary , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with almost every Arab state , and a number of non-Arab ones as well , have deteriorated . Tensions have risen between him and Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization , between him and Syria and between him and the Soviet Union . <P> Last month Gaddafi issued a public message to the Palestinian leaders promising that Libya " will place all of its resources at the disposal of Syria and the Palestinian resistance . " Those resources have turned out to be mostly words of encouragement , plus some fraternal advice from Gaddafi : " I advise you to commit suicide rather than to accept disgrace . Your suicide will immortalize the cause of Palestine for future generations . Your blood is the fuel of the revolution . . . Let suicide be the priority . It is the road to victory .
