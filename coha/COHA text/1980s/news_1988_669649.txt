Unpaved streets and mud and clay huts bake silently in the sub-Saharan sun . Easygoing inhabitants engage in daily activities that have remained unchanged for generations . Strong-boned women dressed in gay , patterned cloth sell vegetables at roadside kiosks - red piles of tomatoes and chili peppers , yams , garden eggs , and groundnuts ( peanuts ) wrapped in newsprint. // // Old women and young girls pound fufu ( cassava and plantain ) in courtyards and stir chili-flavored stews . Chickens roam at will , and babies crawl on the hard-baked earth . Men work , idle , or hunt small game. // Traditional ways of life are preserved in places like Tefle , but someday this typical village scene may be extinct. // Like other African nations , Ghana lingers on the threshold of a technological world that allows no one to remain long on the outside .

Under close examination is the ancient art of storytelling. // STORYTELLING is a favorite pastime in most Ghanaian families and communities . More than simple amusement , it is a highly developed art form that provides a traditional way of disseminating information about society . For centuries , proud forebears have handed down history , customs , beliefs , and a code of social and moral conduct to their progeny through storytelling. // Elders impart this knowledge through stories that may be historical , religious , factual , or allegorical . They teach Ghanaian values like godliness , respect , honor , hospitality , gratitude , tribal pride , and morality. // Some stories teach etiquette - such as how to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how and when to request and receive favors . Tribal and clan history are revealed in stories that often combine fact and myth. // ' ' In my village , ' ' says Becky Amegby , a shopkeeper in Accra , ' ' storytelling is still an honored pastime in the family and community . It is how the children learn about their heritage . A favored time for stories is during a full moon , because our village has no electricity.

On this typical evening in Tefle , a brilliant moon pours streams of silver light over the tin-roofed houses. // In one of the compounds , a log fire highlights the anticipatory glances of children gathered in a squirmy group . Elders , draped in traditional robes , maintain a whispered dignity until the appointed hour when storytelling begins. // Soon an elder calls everyone together . Giggling girls and scampering children cap nervous energy and sit cross-legged near the warm flames . Mothers swaddle infants . Men stop gossiping . All find their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In several respects , storytelling resembles theater . Usually an elder man or woman is the ' ' director ' ' of the evening ' s performance. // When everyone is seated , he introduces the chief storyteller , who moves to a place between the group and the fire , creating a silhouette effect that is useful for acting out parts of the story in the dark. // Although the majority of storytelling is dominated by elders , everyone is expected to share a story sometime during the evening . Good storytellers are respected in the community - especially those who are eloquent , articulate , and accomplished at dramatization . Fables are by far the most popular. // TONIGHT the first story engages a favorite recurring character , Kwaku Ananse , whose escapades and activities teach moral lessons. // ' ' Kwaku Ananse lived with his large family in their village house , ' ' begins the storyteller , a bearded elder with a wizened face and bright , intelligent eyes. // He tells a tale of greed and deception . It ends when Kwaku is discovered and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where he can not be seen. // The story of Kwaku Ananse is a typical fable meant to teach a lesson about selfishness . Other stories might take up pride , greed , or self-centeredness. // Sometimes the stories are acted out by the narrator . Sometimes they take the form of dances . Others involve drumming and singing . Still others include audience participation : Part of the story is a song to which the audience joins in singing a refrain. // Some myths relate to creation or tell about heroes who have championed mankind or given them important benefits . Other stories tell about the origin of death , the gift of fire , the organization of societies , institutions , and customs. // Many of the popular tales feature God as a character .

It is no wonder that storytelling is so popular among villagers. // BUT in the cities , this form of entertainment has largely disappeared. // ' ' Here in Accra , ' ' states Becky Amegby regretfully , ' ' there are too many other things to do - especially for young people . There are restaurants , movie houses , and nightclubs for them . They are not interested in traditional ways. // ' ' To them storytelling is something for the old and ignorant .
