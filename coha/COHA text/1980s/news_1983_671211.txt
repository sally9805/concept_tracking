The M.T.A. board expects to approve the program at a meeting tomorrow despite some questions about how the $821 million to pay for these and other improvements will be raised. // Nearly half the money for the program is expected to come from the 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the Federal gasoline tax that took effect April 1 . But a struggle among different regions of the nation has raised questions about just how much New York will get. // // Ravitch in Washington // Richard Ravitch , the M.T.A. chairman , who was in Washington yesterday to testify before a Senate subcommittee on that very issue , said he was going ahead with the plan because he was " sure that New York will get its fair share. " // " Based on the experience of the last year , " he said , " I am confident that our new goals will be realized . " In the last year , Mr. Ravitch explained , the M.T.A. , using Federal and local subsidies , has purchased 1 , 375 new subway cars and spent more on track and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s. // " There were many who said we were crazy when we set our goals last year , " he said . A year ago , the M.T.A. board approved a $5. 8 billion , five-year capital program for the subways and buses . The new improvements will bring the total to $6. 6 billion. // The highlights of the new spending plan are these : // - Installation of air conditioners on 196 R-40 subway cars at a cost of $20 million . The cars , used on the IND and BMT lines , are 15 years old. // - Modernization of 28 subway stations at a cost of $189 million . This will be in addition to the rehabilitation of 50 stations under the original plan. // - An allowance of $100 million to buy and install an automatic fare-collection system that will reduce , and possibly eliminate , the use of tokens. // - Additions to the system ' s capacity to store subway cars so that all cars will be stored in secure yards . Officials hope that this program , which will cost $72 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depots , one in Manhattan and one in Queens , and the rehabilitation of a third depot on Staten Island , at a total cost of $81 million. // The rest of the money will be used for a variety of projects , including the overhaul of subway cars and the purchase of new buses . In addition , the M.T.A. board is expected to approve projects for the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Commuter Railroad . Details of the proposed improvements on the commuter railroads were not available yesterday. // Aside from the financing questions raised in Washington , other problems loom for the portion of the plan involving the subways and buses. // The rehabilitation of the first 50 subway stations was blocked by a State Supreme Court justice who ruled that under the state ' s Public Buildings Law , wheelchair access had to be provided for the subways . The M.T.A. is trying to have the law amended in Albany to exclude subways. // In addition , there has been community opposition to the building of the two new bus depots . One is planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other for Jamaica , Queens. // M.T.A. officials said the $821 million in additions to the capital plan would be possible because of three new revenue sources . The Federal gas-tax rise is expected to yield $382 million . Officials said they would not revise the figure until Congress took final action. // The agency predicts it will receive $356 million more than expected from the sale of M.T.A. bonds . This was attributed to a higher-thanexpected rating for the bonds , which made them more popular with buyers. // In addition , the purchase of subway cars at prices lower than expected will yield $83 million . In the last year the authority bought cars from companies in Japan , Canada and France. // The way in which the M.T.A. plans to spend the $821 million has come under attack from some local officials . City Council President Carol Bellamy , who is also a member of the M.T.A. board , said she was concerned that there was too much emphasis on " glamour projects " such as station modernization , and not enough on " infrastructure improvements , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her complaint , John D. Simpson , president of the Transit Authority , the M.T.A. agency that runs the subways and buses , said he was altering the plan by moving $12 million from station improvements to infrastructure projects. // These are the station modernizations scheduled under the new plan : <> <> MANHATTAN <> 86th St.-Lexington Ave . ; Brooklyn Bridge ; 96th St.-Broadway ; 59th St.-Columbus Circle ; 34th St.-Seventh Ave. ; 145th St.-St .
