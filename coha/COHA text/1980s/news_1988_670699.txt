And yet the busts probably represented slaves , servants of Rome ' s first imperial family , both of whom received their freedom and whose remains were laid in the columbaria of the Vigna Codini , Roman tombs where these handsome objects were found roughly a century ago. // " Roman Portraits in Context , " an exhibition of works borrowed from the immense storeroom of the Museo Nazionale Romano , one of Italy ' s major repositories of archeological finds , makes a case for the value of considering social history in the study of ancient art . Although there are many beautifully carved , evocative sculptures here , the marble busts have been chosen not simply for esthetic reasons. // It was the intention of the show ' s two curators , Maxwell L. Anderson , the director of the Emory museum , and Leila Nista , inspector of archeology at the museum in Rome , to go beyond the issues of chronology and portrait identification that have traditionally preoccupied archeologists studying these sculptures . In the past , scholars have had to rely principally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busts . Bad excavation techniques , inadequate record keeping and the loss of inscriptions that once accompanied the sculptures have frequently combined to make the business of identification nearly impossible. // By restricting themselves to objects whose past is extensively documented , Mr. Anderson and Ms. Nista have the leisure to consider broad subjects . Each of the works here boasts a provenance that sheds light on the character of the figure portrayed and , by extension , on the society in which the person lived. // That the images of slaves mimicked characteristics of contemporaneous aristocratic portraiture and that they were so elegantly carved - perhaps having been commissioned by members of the imperial family as gifts for their former servants - suggest that class distinctions may have been less rigidly delineated than scholars commonly believe. // Several other busts in the exhibition were originally made for display in the atriums of private houses . Portraits of ancestors were carried in funeral processions when a leading member of the family died . A mask of the deceased , notes Mr. Anderson in the show ' s catalogue , covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lifetime ' s contributions : the insignia earned in service of the state. // " The ritual animation of the dead is a practice we associate with primitive cultures , " Mr. Anderson adds . " Yet the superstitious character of Roman society was thoroughly institutionalized , and it would be mistaken to deprive such images of their original totemic significance because of our idolization of Roman rationality. " // Mr. Anderson and Ms. Nista have divided their display according to function ; there are not only funerary monuments but also propagandistic portraits for public display and self-conscious images made for private contemplation . The loan of these objects over a lengthy period of time - six months , ending Jan. 3 , 1989 - constitutes the inaugural effort in an ambitious and unusual scheme called the Emory University Museum International Loan Project . It promises to bring antiquities to Atlanta from the storerooms of various European collections. // Institutions like the Museo Nazionale are provided with a showcase for objects that they have neither the room nor the money to maintain on permanent display . Emory sponsors research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two museums ; and a scholarly symposium takes place at the school. // As an educational boon for the university and its archeology students , and also as a forum for the presentation of noteworthy works that are otherwise out of public view , the loan project would seem to serve all its participants handsomely . Plans are already in the pipeline for shows of classical Greek art and of early Roman colored-marble sculpture. // The busts in " Roman Portraits in Context " crowd one modest-sized room of this museum , which the architect Michael Graves redesigned three years ago in characteristic post-modern fashion . The exhibition betrays minor signs of an institutional collaboration still in formation . Neither the labels that accompany the objects nor the well-illustrated catalogue , with its unfortunately inelegant essay in English by Ms. Nista , provides information adequate for the uninitiated viewer. // Yet even a cursory perusal of the busts rewards a visitor with a survey of Roman portraiture in myriad stylistic guises . A penchant during the late Republic for painstaking realism and sobriety , inherited from both Etruscan and Greek Hellenistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reign of Augustus , in the first half of the first century A.D. Included here is a becalmed bust of the prince Germanicus from this latter period that was intended for display in a public square , where its regal , otherworldly countenance would serve as an inspirational image. // Beginning with Vespasian , represented in a craggy , unflinching portrait from the second half of the first century , realism re-emerges as a favored style among the aristocracy . Caracalla ' s rule during the third century A.D. solidified the reintroduction of worry lines into portraiture - a trait that certain scholars have extravagantly interpreted as expressing larger societal concerns about the empire ' s increasing instability. // Ms. Nista has ventured a guess at the identity of a previously unidentified bust : She links its discovery at a location where the Emperor Septimus Severus built a monument with what is known of imperial portraiture at the time . Judging by its cascading locks of hair , carefully parted beard and classicized , heroic features , the work , she thinks , may well have been an idealized vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagery on the Roman populace can be measured by another bust made around the end of the first century , portraying a woman whose carefully curled hair style studiously imitates royal tastes of the time . By placing this bust and the one thought to be Septimus Severus near a markedly benign , self-effacing depiction of an older woman who may once have been a slave , this exhibition underscores the subtle variety of social distinctions that ancient sculptors meticulously documented. // They are distinctions readily appreciated by modern viewers instinctively able to read meaning into the dress and facial expression of others . This show reminds us that such signals , fundamental and unspoken aspects of social discourse today , served the same role in centuries past . It is the lesson of " Roman Portraits in Context " that by learning about the milieu in which ancient busts were produced and exhibited , we see more vividly the faces they so eloquently depict. //
