EXTERIOR : NORTH WOODS - DAY CAMERA TRACKING FAST ACROSS the trunks of silver birch trees in dense forest . The movement is so fast the trees are blurred and barely recognizable . As titles roll , we hear : a large workhorse trotting hard on dirt and gravel ; the horse snorting , blowing hard ; a man 's labored breathing ; leather harness creaking ; the sounds of buggy springs and rubber tires rolling fast . ( Titles end . ) CAMERA STILL TRACKING , pans onto the flaring nostrils and teeth of a big draft horse straining in his bridle at a breakaway trot . CAMERA PANS CLOSE along leather harness and lathered horseflesh to arrive close on an old man 's burly , gnarled hands clutching the reins . Voice-over of the old man . &nbsp; BERTRUM ( voice-over ) Mel ! You meathead ! Goddamnit , yer gon na kill us both ! Whoa ! You sonofabitch ! PAN ONTO BERTRUM , CLOSE : In his late sixties but built like an oak tree . He wears a pair of old brown coveralls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded blue railroad cap with the Great Northern insignia on it ( a mountain goat against the Rockies ) . He clutches the reins of a makeshift buckboard and tries desperately to control the runaway horse . ANGLE ON BERTRUM 'S BACK as the horse breaks into a gallop . The buckboard careens off the road , away from camera , heading straight for a ditch . &nbsp; BERTRUMYer gon na be dogmeat when this is over ! I 'm sellin ' you at the killer 's price ! Mel ! Whoa !  --  53  --  Suddenly , the buckboard flips over completely when it hits the ditch , sending BERTRUM headlong into a birch tree . Mel breaks loose from his harness , then stops , turns , and just stands there looking at the unconscious BERTRUM and the overturned buckboard with the wheels still spinning . Vapor blasts from Mel 's nostrils . A moment of total stillness , then the cry of a loon is heard in the distance . ANGLE ON ROAD . CLOSE ON MEL 'S EYE staring at the wreckage . CUT TO : INTERIOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into room through a window in the door . She is carrying a small plastic bag full of lemon drops . She is dressed in fashionable big-city clothes -- dark skirt and jacket , white blouse , high heels . She is slightly rumpled from a recent airplane ride . KATE 'S POINT OF VIEW . She sees BERTRUM splayed out in a hospital bed , IV bottles hanging around his head . He is apparently asleep , his breathing slow and labored . Behind him is a large picture window framing a view of Lake Superior with barges and tugboats inching their way across the background in the distance ( mock-up ) . CLOSE ON KATE . CLOSE ON KATE 'S HANDS as she reaches into the bag of lemon drops without looking -- a few fall to the floor . BACK ON KATE 'S FACE , surprised . She looks down the hallway ; a nurse is rolling a cart away . She fumbles to get all of the lemon drops back into the bag . She kicks the few she 's missed and blows the dust off the ones in her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her father 's bed and stares at his sleeping face ,  --  54  --  bandaged and bruised . As she leans over to kiss his forehead he suddenly speaks to her , without opening his eyes . She pulls back . &nbsp; BERTRUMPregnant ? &nbsp; KATEDad --  &nbsp; BERTRUMYou are , are n't ya ? I can smell it . Pregnant women have this sweet smell they put off . &nbsp; KATECould you at least open your eyes when you 're talking to me ?

Used to be men . All men . &nbsp; KATEWould you mind opening your eyes , Dad ? I 've been flying for hours and I 'd like to see your eyes . BERTRUM pops his eyes open and stares at her . &nbsp; KATEThanks . BERTRUM spots the bag of lemon drops . He snatches it out of her hand and digs one out , but ca n't manage to bring it up to his mouth from stiffness . He holds the lemon drop out to KATE . &nbsp; BERTRUMDrop it in my mouth , would ya ? I 'm seized up . BERTRUM holds his mouth open like a bird . KATE drops it in . &nbsp; KATEYou had a wreck , huh ? &nbsp; BERTRUMBastard tried to kill me.  --  55  --  &nbsp; KATEMel ? &nbsp; BERTRUMYeah , Mel . Who else ? He 's had a grudge against me since the day he was foaled . &nbsp; KATEWell , it 's no wonder , the way you treat him . &nbsp; BERTRUMI treat him like a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... Whad'ya know about horses , anyway ? Yer a big-city-girl now , are n't ya ? &nbsp; KATEAw , come on , Dad . Knock it off , will ya ? Awkward pause between them . BERTRUM crunches down loudly on the lemon drop and grinds it between his teeth . He stares hard at KATE . She tries to force a smile . &nbsp; BERTRUMYer gon na have to shoot him for me . Ya know that , do n't ya ? Yer the only one I can trust to get it done . &nbsp; KATEI 'm not gon na shoot your horse , Dad . I left my work .

It 's not good for you to get so excited . I mean you 're supposed to be taking it easy now . The horse can wait . &nbsp; BERTRUMIt ca n't wait ! He wo n't know what he 's gettin ' shot for if we wait !  --  56  --  &nbsp; KATEWell , I 'm not shooting him ! Pause , as KATE just stares at him . BERTRUMUM cools down , settles back , disappointed in her . He gestures toward the bag of lemon drops . He points to his mouth . KATE takes one out of the bag and drops it into his mouth . CLOSE ON BERTRUM as he turns his head away from her and stares out the window , sucking on the lemon drop . BERTRUM 'S POINT OF VIEW of Lake Superior out the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . CLOSE ON BERTRUM . &nbsp; BERTRUM ( staring out the window ) You were my last hope . What I deserve for not havin ' a son , I suppose . CLOSE ON KATE . She makes a long exhale , tries to change the subject . We see a slight desperation come over her , as though trying to keep herself from sliding into old familiar emotional patterns with her father . &nbsp; KATEHow 's the rest of the family doing ? Anybody else in the hospital ? &nbsp; BERTRUMNot the ones who deserve it most . &nbsp; KATEOh , like Mom , for instance ? &nbsp; BERTRUMNah , she 's beyond the hospital . &nbsp; KATEGramma , I suppose . &nbsp; BERTRUMThere ya go .

BERTRUM struggles to prop himself up on one elbow . He leans toward KATE and suddenly becomes very confidential . &nbsp; BERTRUMHere 's what you wan na do . You draw an X. You take a piece of chalk and you draw a line from one ear to the opposite eye . CLOSE ON KATE as BERTRUM continues . She sees she 's getting nowhere with the old man . She sets the bag of lemon drops in his hand and starts to back out of the room as BERTRUM raves on . &nbsp; BERTRUMThen you do the same on the other side of his head . Now , where those two lines intersect , that 's where you wan na put the bullet . &nbsp; KATE ( backing out ) I 'll be back to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest now .

As camera keeps tracking in Kate 's point of view , a racetrack announcer 's voice on TV becomes dominant over the other sounds . The voice of the announcer rises with excitement as the horses close down the stretch . CAMERA ARRIVES ON UNCLE DANE 'S BACK . He is standing in one of the rooms watching the horse race on a TV mounted high on the wall . He is dressed in a hospital smock , hospital slippers , and a green baseball cap .

Look , you know when I first left here , there was n't a thing I had in my mind except to get as far away from this place as I possibly could . I mean , far .

KATE and RITA bend down and grab opposite ends of the TV and lift it slowly , as they continue their conversation . They start carrying  --  73  --  the TV slowly through the house toward the back door , struggling with the weight of it . Camera dollies with them as the dialogue continues : &nbsp; RITAI know Dad 's in the hospital . Christ , Kate . &nbsp; KATENo , I do n't know , it 's more than that . I guess it 's family , you know . Ever since you called me about his accident , I 've been feeling this thing . &nbsp; RITAWhat thing ? &nbsp; KATELike time is running out or something . Like this might be my last chance with him . They reach the back door , open it , and go out into a small wooden porch with a railing that drops steeply down into a little ditch . Bright moonlight .

KATE gives the TV a shove and it goes end over end , crashing into the gorge below with a white explosion . CUT TO : Section Details INTERIOR : HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME NIGHT BERTRUM is now rolling drunk and ranting at the world in general . He crashes around the room like a rabid bear . UNCLE DANE is in  --  74  --  even worse shape , but all he can do is switch the channels on the TV aimlessly , half listening to BERTRUM 's tirade . &nbsp; BERTRUMThe main issue ! The main issue of the world at large is one thing and one thing only . And you wan na know what that one thing is ? &nbsp; UNCLE DANEThere is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue .

Justice and Injustice . That 's the two main issues of the world today . &nbsp; UNCLE DANEI thought there was only one main issue . ANGLE ON TV SCREEN as DANE flips through the channels . BACK TO BERTRUM AND DANE in the room . &nbsp; BERTRUMNow , in a case like government -- big government --  United Nations kin'a stuff . You think they give a rat 's diddly-ass about a lone , single citizen like myself , for instance ? Up here in the frontier-locked away from the world in the far north of America ? A man who 's fought in the trenches of Italy ; in the slime of Korea ; who broke his back on the railroad tracks of Lake Erie !

CUT TO : CLOSE ON MEL 'S HEAD surrounded by blackness , as in a vision . There are two white chalk lines drawn on his black face ,  --  75  --  exactly as Bertrum described to Kate -- one from each ear to the opposite eye , forming a large X in the center of his face . His eyes are wild and fearful . A loud gunshot is heard on the cut . CUT TO : Section Details INTERIOR : AMY 'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING KATE sits up fast in bed , shaking off the vision .

Voice-overs of RITA and AMY with JILLY 's moans heard in the background . &nbsp; RITA ( offscreen ) Jilly , you do n't stop that moanin ' , you can go out in the barn . ANGLE ON KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING . RITA is standing , on tiptoe , up on the counter , putting the secret panel back together . The deer rifle lies on the counter below her . AMY is at the stove , fixing a huge breakfast -- much more than the four of them can actually eat . The table is set for four with stacks of steaming pancakes , toast , sausage , coffee , biscuits -- the whole works .

She could no more shoot a horse than a fly . You know how Kate is . She just talks . Just like her father . RITA climbs down from counter with the rifle . &nbsp; RITAWell , she 's got this crazy idea in her head that she owes Dad something and I do n't trust it . &nbsp; AMYWell , they 've always had a strange relationship .

Carry on as though you 're still in the land of the living . She turns and goes back to the stove , as though resigned to continue with her duties , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . That was always the thing with Mother . Bless her heart . Only difference today is a notable lack of menfolk . There used to always be men . Always . As she turns from the stove to carry more food to the table , suddenly the small Formica table is transformed into a long plank farm table , with farmhands and the men of her past . BERTRUM is there , at the head , much younger , in grimy overalls and work shirt . Big , burly uncles and cousins , all different ages . All men . They are digging into their breakfasts and ignore AMY 's presence . Loud conversation , boisterous laughter , pipe smoke , and steaming coffee . AMY continues in the scene as though this were strictly her memory . She remains in the present , dressed the same . She sets more food down in front of them and circles the table with a pot of coffee , reaching over and between them to fill their cups . She keeps talking to herself through all this . &nbsp; AMY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Elbows . Big beefy legs and knees . Had to serve them above their heads . Over and above with the gravy .

AMY returns to the stove with the coffeepot . She sets the pot down . As AMY passes an alcove doorway , KATE appears , brushing her teeth , wearing a bathrobe . She just stands there and watches her mother , listening casually to her . She 's become used to Amy 's  --  78  --  running monologues . AMY pays no attention to KATE 's presence . It 's as though she 's in a world of her own . &nbsp; AMY ( CONTINUING ; TO HERSELF ) Kinda miss it , though . Just the smell of them . Miss that sometimes .

No , I could never go to the city . &nbsp; KATEOh , come on . Just for a visit .

UNCLE DANE 'S POINT OF VIEW of car getting closer and closer . DANE gives a look to BERTRUM , then runs for the shoulder of the road , leaving BERTRUM , still bent over , hands on his knees . CLOSE ON BERTRUM staring down the road at the headlights , which are getting closer . He slowly straightens himself up to a standing position , facing the charging car , then slowly raises his arm high over his head and gives the car the finger . He just holds this position rigidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to the anonymous car . CLOSE ON UNCLE DANE lying on his belly , off the shoulder of the road , watching BERTRUM and the approaching car .

Bertrum ! &nbsp; BERTRUMThis is for Korea , sucker ! And the railroad , and everything else that happened before you were born ! UNCLE DANE 'S POINT OF VIEW . BERTRUM is steadfast , holding his position with his finger raised high at the speeding car .  --  116  --  The car horn blares and stays on a continuous note as the car heads straight toward the unyielding BERTRUM . BERTRUM 'S POINT OF VIEW . The car is heading directly toward him , headlights blinking , horn blaring . The car swerves at the last second and misses him by inches , tires screaming , then continues on down the road with the horn still blaring and fading into the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remains there with his finger still raised high , like a military statue . CLOSE ON UNCLE DANE , wild-eyed , splattered with mud , half buried by the side of the road . He stares at BERTRUM . ANGLE ON BERTRUM still standing like a statue with his finger up in the air . He squints at something down the road , in the distance . BERTRUM 'S POINT OF VIEW . Way down the road , in the middle of the yellow line , can be seen the image of Mel emerging , with the three women on his back , heading straight toward BERTRUM . At first , the image is slightly blurred and silent , like a dream , shimmering in moonlight . CLOSE ON BERTRUM still frozen . He blinks his eyes hard and tries to focus on the vision . BERTRUM 'S POINT OF VIEW . Now Mel and the women can be made out more clearly . They are getting closer . The sound of Mel 's hooves on the blacktop . CLOSE ON BERTRUM . His breathing becomes rapid . Sweat breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremble but keeps staring down the road and holding his position . He tries to speak to DANE , but nothing comes out . The high shrill sound of a loon is accompanied by the shrieks of all three women , but now they sound like barbarian hordes in full battle . The thundering of Mel 's hooves getting closer .  --  117  --  BERTRUM 'S POINT OF VIEW . He sees a nightmare approaching . Mel has the white X painted on his face and he 's in full gallop , sparks flying from his hooves . The women are all in primitive warpaint ; strips of rawhide with skulls tied to them clatter around their waists . They brandish sickles and lances with banners streaming from them . They carry knives between their teeth . They scream savagely like demons from hell as they swoop down on BERTRUM . CLOSE ON BERTRUM . He is shaking violently , frothing at the mouth , sweat rolling down his cheeks but still refusing to move an inch from his stance . ANGLE ON UNCLE DANE pulling himself up from the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DANEBertrum ? Bertrum ? CLOSE ON BERTRUM . He speaks to DANE . &nbsp; BERTRUMThat 's my horse !

Bertrum ? ANGLE ON UNCLE DANE seeing BERTRUM fall , then seeing Mel and the women approach . UNCLE DANE 'S POINT OF VIEW . He sees Mel and the women in their normal guise , all dressed as themselves and Mel without the X. KATE pulls Mel right beside BERTRUM and she dismounts and approaches BERTRUM . &nbsp; UNCLE DANEBertrum ? Bertrum ? CLOSE ON KATE seeing BERTRUM . &nbsp; KATEDad ?

CUT TO : INTERIOR : GRAMMA 'S HOUSE - MIDMORNING A large throng of women gathered around Gramma 's living room table for her birthday . They all sing a Finnish song for her . The remains of a gigantic breakfast on the plates in front of them . GRAMMA sits at the head of the table in her wheelchair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles . She is surrounded by the family and their children -- all girls . Not a man in sight . Close behind GRAMMA are AMY , KATE , RITA , and JILLY , all decked out in party dresses . GRAMMA wears a pink bow in her hair . She seems completely bewildered by the whole event . The  --  119  --  room is overflowing with laughter , conversation , and buoyant female energy . A bottle of champagne is making the rounds . Lots of beer on the table . JILLY is sloshed again and having a great time . All these women are big-boned , raw , blond country girls with a very definite Nordic similarity among them . ANGLE ON KATE as she steps forward to ask for a pause in the festivities . She moves up beside GRAMMA and puts her hand on GRAMMA 's shoulder . GRAMMA is still bewildered by it all . Singing , clapping ends . &nbsp; KATECome on , Gramma , blow out your candles . &nbsp; GRAMMAI 'm not gon na blow any candles out . &nbsp; KATEOh , come on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; KATEEverybody , one . . . two . . . three !

GRAMMA pulls the present out of its wrapping and stares at it . It 's the photo of Amy and the girls on the pony , now in a bright gold frame .
