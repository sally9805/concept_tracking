By the time President Reagan finally vetoed a congressional bill that would have imposed strong new economic sanctions against South Africa , the event seemed almost as anticlimactic as the Administration had probably hoped it would be . Last Friday at 8 p.m. , scarcely four hours before the bill would have become law without the President 's signature , the White House announced that , as expected , Reagan had vetoed it . Portions of the measure , said the President , would " seriously impede the prospects for a peaceful end to apartheid and the establishment of a free and open society for all in South Africa . " The U.S. , he added , " must stay and build , not cut and run . " <P> Congressional reaction was immediate  --  and strong . While some Republicans supported the President 's action , most Democrats were outraged . Even before the White House announcement , Representative Mickey Leland of Texas , chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus , told a rally that Reagan had been waiting " like a thief in the night to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " California Congressman Norman Mineta maintained that neither Congress nor the public would tolerate " this indecent act . " Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts declared , " It is sad that the President persists in locking himself into a failed and lonely policy that has put America on the side of racism in South Africa . " In effect acknowledging the criticism , Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole remarked , " It might have been a bit easier politically if the President had just swallowed hard and signed it , but he could n't do that in good conscience . " <P> This week , more than three months after the House of Representatives first passed a sanctions bill by a voice vote and later overwhelmingly approved a revised version by a vote of 308 to 77 , the final disposition of the measure may be settled at last . Attention will focus on the Senate , which passed the bill in August by a vote of 84 to 14 . To reach the 34 votes necessary to prevent the Senate from overriding Reagan 's veto , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds and support the President . At week 's end congressional observers thought the President had the support of no more than 28 Senators total , half a dozen short of the number needed to keep the bill from becoming law . <P> Last year the President adroitly headed off a similar defeat by announcing an Executive Order that imposed some of the sanctions included in a bill then pending in Congress . Among them : a restriction on loans by Americans to South African government agencies and a ban on the export of most nuclear technology and materials . But the current legislation , passed during an election year and at a time when American outrage against South Africa is on the rise , goes much farther . It bans all new American investment in and bank loans to South Africa , as well as air traffic between the two countries . It also prohibits the import of South African uranium , coal , steel , textiles , military vehicles and agricultural products .                 @ @ @ @
