 | Paul Volcker is showing that he really does have a warm heart after all . He 's going to let the economy try to pick up speed . The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and his colleagues , who get lots of blame for stifling economic growth when they push interest rates up , now have decided to let the money supply grow at a faster rate than they previously had thought prudent . That decision , reached at a policymaking meeting in early July , means : Interest rates are likely to continue to slide in the months ahead , the economy 's pace should accelerate and the dollar 's value should continue to fall . Tightening up might have squeezed inflation further , but it also might have risked throwing the economy into recession . What the Fed actually did was broaden its 1985 growth target range for the basic money supply and shift to a higher level the base upon which the target is calculated . The basic money supply , Ml , includes currency in circulation , checking accounts , traveler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a growth rate of 3 to 8 percent for the rest of 1985 , rather than the 4 to 7 percent approved in February . The money supply grew at an 11.7 percent rate through June . The change means the Fed now does not have to push down as hard on the money supply to hit its target . The stock market expressed its approval by taking off on a spree . The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a record 1,357.97 on the news from the Fed and elsewhere . The dollar 's value sagged in currency markets . Traders interpreted the new Fed policy as foreshadowing lower interest rates and possibly higher inflation in the United States . Either would make the dollar less attractive to hold . But a less expensive dollar would make it easier for American companies to sell their goods abroad . Where 's the " oomph " ? Says Ben Laden , chief economist for T. Rowe Price Associates , Inc. , in Baltimore , reflecting the prevailing sentiment among private analysts : " There 's no danger of a recession for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show any real oomph either . " The Fed 's new forecast sees " somewhat more-rapid economic growth " over the last half of this year than the weak performance turned in during the first half . Even so , the growth for all of 1985 is estimated at no more than 3 percent after adjustment for inflation , well short of the White House 's official 3.9 percent projection . Still , the Reagan administration refused to temper its optimism . At a press conference after Volcker disclosed the Fed 's moves , Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige merely reiterated the official prediction of " stronger growth in the second half . " Weak first half . The economy 's lethargic condition at midsummer has showed up in a series of new government reports . Total output of goods and services turned out to be even weaker than had been estimated or expected during the April-toJune months . The economy expanded by a skimpy 1.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter , the government said . That was far short of the 3.1 percent " flash " estimate issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasters were anticipating . Coupled with the barely perceptible 0.3 percent growth rate in the first quarter , that means the economy expanded by about 1 percent from January through June . For growth to achieve the Fed 's projection for the full year , Volcker said in his semiannual report to Congress , it will have to  | proceed at a " 4 percent plus " pace from now through December . The nation 's factories continued to show little life in June . Industrial production picked up a scant 0.1 percent over May . Factory output has been limp during the past year , rising only 1.8 percent since last July . Industrial capacity use edged down in June to 80.7 percent , an additional one tenth of 1 percentage point . The June capacity rate is the lowest since February of last year . Wave of imports . Domestic production still is being battered by import competition . The flood of foreign-made goods into the U.S. surged to a 440.7-billion-dollar rate in the second quarter from 435 billion in the first quarter . That means cost-conscious consumers still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar 's high value . Shoppers also were turning more cautious , even though their earnings were improving . Personal income rose by a 0.5 percent annual rate last month after declining by the same amount in May . Auto sales slid in June and early July . Retail sales slipped 0.8 percent in June . Consumer spending " has definitely slowed down , " said Philip Hawley , chairman of Carter Hawley Hale , Inc. , a major retail chain . Home-construction starts rose a slim 1.9 percent in June , disappointing many analysts who had expected a larger gain . Mortgage rates have been falling for some time . In early July , they hit their lowest level in nearly six years , the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported . Businesses are continuing to invest in new plant and equipment . Capital spending held strong in the second quarter , rising by a 13.6 percent annual rate . But companies are keeping a tight rein on inventories . Managers are working off existing stocks instead of buying more . Thus , inventories fell by 0.4 percent in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news is on the inflation front . The producer price index , which signals future retail price trends , registered no increase in June . The index is up only 1.4 percent , on an annual rate basis , for the first six months of the year . With inflation subdued , the Fed felt it could accommodate the bulge in the money supply in May and June . The central bankers do not see inflation breaking loose in the next 18 months . The board is forecasting an inflation rate for this year of between 3.75 and 4 percent , as measured by the gross-national-product ( GNP ) deflator , and between 3.75 and 4.75 percent next year . Those ranges compare with a 3.8 percent inflation rate in 1984 . Volcker told Congress he thinks " we will do better " in containing inflation than the official forecast indicates . He noted that the reserve board 's policymaking open-market committee has overestimated the extent of inflation in each of the last four years . He firmly rejected the notion that the new policy represents a " yielding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dollar 's value drops too sharply , which would be inflationary , the Fed might be forced to tighten up again . Some Fed watchers see the situation differently , however . " The war on inflation is over , though a lot of the troops do n't realize it , " declared A. Gary Shilling , a New York economic consultant . " The Fed is willing to settle for a 3 to 4 percent inflation for the foreseeable future . " Whether or not the war on inflation is ended , it seems clear that a truce has been declared . Since the Fed has decided " not to let the economy fall into a recession , " says Nariman Behravesh , chief forecaster for Wharton Econometrics in Philadelphia , " it wo n't hesitate to let interest rates come down . " Many private analysts are now looking for the prime rate , the interest that major banks charge on short-term loans to their most creditworthy customers , to fall further from its current 9.5 percent perch . The consensus sees the prime at 9 percent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key rate could drop as low as 8 percent . Lower rates should give the economy a boost , but that 's not expected to ease unemployment much . Analysts tend to agree with the Fed forecast that the joblessness rate will still be in the 7 to 7.25 percent range in this year 's fourth quarter . In June , 7.3 percent of the civilian labor force was out of work . Volcker told Congress that even if all goes well over the next 18 months and substantial gains are recorded in employment , " unemployment would be expected to drop only a little , if at all . " He said job opportunities would continue to expand in service industries but not in manufacturing , where employment has been falling . The great unknown in all the forecasts is what Washington will or wo n't do about the big federal budget deficits . Congressional negotiations were at an impasse in late July with a recess scheduled in early August until after Labor Day . Budget bargaining could be resumed in the fall , but that would not assure progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that we 're overspending , " an angry Donald Regan , the White House chief of staff , told a meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce . " That 's disgraceful . " Long-term outlook . At stake is the economy 's course after 1985 . Most experts believe the Fed 's money-supply decision assures that the economy will continue to expand through this year and into next . But many professional economists are convinced that failure by Congress to act on the deficit this year would release inflationary forces and send interest rates shooting back up next year . That would raise the risk of a recession later in 1986 or 1987 . Volcker said the Fed 's forecast of moderate economic growth in 1986 is counting on the passage of a deficitreduction package of about 50 billion dollars . Private analysts expect less , but they all assume some action to cut the red ink . If those expectations are dashed , warns Lawrence Chimerine , chief economist for Chase Econometrics in Bala-Cynwyd , Pa. , " by next year , interest rates will go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if Congress cooperates by paring the deficit as the Fed 's new policy takes hold , the economy could hum along nicely this year and next . Then Volcker could light up a celebratory cigar .
