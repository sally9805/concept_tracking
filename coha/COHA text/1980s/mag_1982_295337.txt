In Southern California , they have practically begged the swallows to return to Capistrano , where the birds are a big tourist attraction . But the central California city of Fairfield ( pop . 58,000 ) has for three months suffered an almost Hitchcockian invasion of birds . Starlings , perhaps 200,000 at one time , have chosen to winter in a local eucalyptus grove . Major Hal Biestek , a pilot stationed at nearby Travis Air Force Base , lives close to the grove , directly under the starlings ' flight path . " It was so loud , " said Biestek of the birds ' chirps and screeches , " it kept us awake at night . " <P> Noise was not the half of it . Starlings eat one-eighth their weight in food each day , and they have an extremely high metabolic rate . In short , Fairfield has been whitewashed with droppings , leading some townspeople to walk with opened umbrellas on cloudless days . <P> Fairfield 's citizens blew whistles , banged pots and rang cowbells to shoo the flocks . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A captured starling , rumor has it , was strangled , his death squeals recorded , and the tape played over loudspeakers . The birds were only briefly gulled . <P> Then Major Biestek took command in the way he knows best : airpower . With recruits from a local model airplane club , he sent up a squadron of a dozen remote-controlled planes to engage the starlings in dogfights . Said Biestek : " When you saw a flock coming in , you just aimed an airplane at it . The airplanes have a very high fright index . We got rid of well over 95% of the birds . " The starlings were only scared to death , not actually dead ; no bird casualties have been confirmed . But five of Biestek 's planes were downed , two permanently . And air superiority lasted only a few days . Last week a flock of some 50,000 starlings returned . Admits one model-plane pilot : " They 've got a lot more flying experience than we do .
