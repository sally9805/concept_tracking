alogue from a firm that sold power tools ; and a cashier 's check for $10 million . Of course at first she assumed that the check had been sent in jest and , after smirking , was about to tear it up when she reflected that , having no friends , she was unlikely to be the target of jokes : people simply did not pull them on strangers . Therefore next morning she went to a branch of the bank that issued the check . " Oh , that 's good as gold , all right , " said the teller to whom she presented it . He conducted her to the office of the branch manager , who was very obsequious , so there could be no doubt that the check was real . Janice put the bulk of the sum with a financial manager , who proceeded to increase it enormously through shrewd investments , and in no time she was one of the richest women in her part of the country and could quit her job and do anything she wanted with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hordes of people began to apply for her friendship , and the remarkable thing was that most of them had a great deal of money themselves , as much as or even more than Janice . That is to say , the expected fortune hunter was notably absent . Her new friends certainly did n't need her financial help . There was no getting away from accepting the fact that they found her well worth knowing for herself alone , insisting on entertaining her lavishly , even refusing , until she was at the point of being offended , to let her reciprocate , and when she was finally permitted to hold a dinner party at her new mansion , the guests brought housewarming gifts such as solid-gold teacups , real teardrop diamonds for the chandelier , and original canvases from the Venetian High Renaissance . Before long Janice had marriage proposals from the bachelor governor of a Midwestern state , a vintage motion-picture mogul , and several young leaders of industry . But she spurned them all for the moment . She enjoyed being in the world of money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreet practice of slipping out from time to time , dressed modestly and unaccompanied , for a few sets of tennis at the public courts , on which occasions she played well enough to hold her own with anybody . Or she dropped in at a unisex pool parlor , where she played badly , or perhaps loitered at the garden center , where she found all sorts of people who were interested in plants , or at a wine shop , where she was asked her opinions of various bottles . And in all these places Janice was now extraordinarily popular . Certainly the men were wild about her , and even the women thought she was an intriguing person , and nobody among them suspected she had a dollar . But after charming all these people Janice found that she was terribly bored with them . They had served their purpose once they submitted to her . She certainly had no reason to feel beholden to them : what had they done for her when she needed friends ? Therefore one day they saw her no more . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated by the granting of her wish . She only regretted that she had not asked sooner ! CHARLIE BOLGER was the " super , " which is to say , janitor of a large apartment building in the middle of the city . He had had this job since coming home from the war , and he hated it , and the tenants he served , more every year . He spent most of his days sitting in an old overstuffed chair , down in the rent-free one-room ground-floor apartment that the management used as an excuse to pay him very little in wages , and what he did when he sat there , though a working television set was just across the room , was nurse his hatred of the people who lived in the building that rose above him . He was fond of pointing out to himself  --  he had never had many friends  --  that you did n't know the human race until you served them as a menial and were called to unclog their drains and unlock their brats from the bathroom and clean up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his building ) and shuffle your feet while they fumbled for a stingy tip and go to the door of every apartment at the appropriate time and wish the occupant thereof a Merry Xmas and take the niggardly envelope offered in response . Charlie had remained a bachelor , because in his earlier years the occasional professional supplied all he needed of femininity . He had always disliked talking to women , believing them , however pleasant they appeared , to be secretly critical of him . Finally the day came when he found himself totally devoid of even the feeble physical need the other sex had sometimes stirred in him , and from then on his only association with the human race was as flunky to master or mistress , and he had hundreds of those . But Charlie 's hatred might well have remained passive , impotent , and routine in a city full of such types had he not , apparently by chance , discovered a device with which to express it effectively , even devastatingly , and incur no personal risk whatever . This discovery was preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faulty dryer in the laundry room had burned up a load of clothing belonging to a woman who was peevish and importunate in the best of times ) by Charlie 's uttering a sequence of oaths , followed by a fervent wish that he had some clean , quiet , secret means by which , with impunity , he could rid the world of persons who annoyed him . It was the next morning , while wrestling the garbage cans out to the sidewalk in preparation for the visit of the sanitation truck  --  single-handedly : his wretched helper had once again called in sick  --  that at the top of a lidless container Charlie found his weapon , a red-and-blue plastic toy pistol , a so-called Galaxy Disintegrator modeled after one brandished by the hero in a blockbuster science-fiction movie . This had obviously been discarded by one of the innumerable spoiled children who lived in the building . It was probably not even out of order : the kid had simply been bored . Charlie seized it by the butt , which was molded of flimsy , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its visible spring . No doubt it made a clicking sound when " fired . " He had not been especially childish even as a little boy , and whatever playfulness he had known had long since been exhausted , yet now , almost lightheartedly , Charlie raised the toy and pointed it at the approaching mailman , a malicious individual who loved to load building supers with armloads of packages too large for the postal boxes . At the moment this worthy was already extending toward Charlie a document to be signed  --  perhaps a registered letter containing a subpoena for one of the tenants , perhaps for a man who was delinquent with his child-support payments . You could imagine his gratitude to the super for accepting the envelope . " Hi , Charlie , " cried the mailman , making his habitual derisive grin and , if precedent were to be followed , preparing one of his insulting wisecracks , e.g. , " Still working on your first million ? " " So long , sucker , " said Charlie . He pulled the trigger of the toy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made by the tongue against the roof of the mouth , and the mailman instantly disappeared , without even the proverbial puff of smoke ! Charlie was badly frightened , not because he believed for a moment that he had actually caused the postman to disintegrate into particles too small to be detected by the eye , but rather because he suspected that his mind had cracked , that he had suffered a hallucination . For he had always been a very literal man , with no imagination and with no respect for anyone who had one . So now he was really worried about his sanity , and he even went so far as to make an emergency appointment with the psychiatrist who occupied one of the ground-floor offices in the apartment building . " Well , well , uh , Charlie , is n't it ? " said this practitioner when the super was seated before his desk . " Before we get down to business , I 'd like to point out that the lobby could use a good mopping . " Charlie told this doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suffered . Dr. Hilfer asked : " Has this mailman turned up since ? " " No , sir . But then he 's not due again till tomorrow morning . " Hilfer narrowed his eyes . " You 're saying you murdered him , are n't you , Charlie ? " At the super 's gasp-ing attempts to protest , the doctor raised a hand . " No , no . We 're not afraid to face the truth here . You did well in coming immediately to me . You 'll never spend a night in jail , I 'll promise you that . " He rose , finished with Charlie until the next appointment . Charlie asked him to specify his fee . When Dr. Hilfer said that , because of the courtesy discount extended to employees of the building , it was only $100 per visit , Charlie pulled out the Space Disintegrator and made the psychiatrist vanish . With this disappearance of another person at whom he had pointed the toy weapon , the super began to think that perhaps he was not imagining things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting rid of human beings without any attendant problems , not even the least destruction of property . He tried it next on a boy of twelve , an exceptionally obnoxious youth in a building full of such , and the Doberman that the lad allowed , even encouraged , to disregard the law against soiling the sidewalks . Click-click , another problem was removed . But Charlie was not a cruel man ; the kid had parents by whom he would have been missed . The super therefore considerately erased ( as he had come to call it ) Mr. and Mrs. Hochman as well . And also , in a development not related to the foregoing , all persons who lived on the south cor-ridor of the fourth floor were caused to disappear , for one or more of them persistently fouled the floor there with a dark , viscous liquid very like motor oil and also , sometimes , a very fine gravel . And soon to vanish was a wealthy man who lived in one of the penthouses and yet always tipped Charlie as though he resided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie also erased four airline stewardesses who shared an apartment . They were old offenders against the plumbing ; no sink or washstand would long run free if that hairy quartet were allowed access to it . And he expunged a pair of handsome men who shared one-bedroom quarters and had never , in four years , been seen to admit a female person onto their premises : Charlie had never subscribed to the principle of live and let . And the following persons were never seen again after he pointed the Disintegrator at them : his feckless assistant , who though twenty years younger always allowed Charlie to do the dirtier and heavier tasks ; the morning doorman , who believed that his uniform made him socially superior to a super in dark-green denim ; a passing stranger who spat upon the sidewalk ; the heavy , sour man who had replaced the mail carrier who had been Charlie 's first prey ; and a very fat woman who was so tasteless as to cram herself into designer jeans and a snug T-shirt . At this point he ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so designated , though there was no evidence that they suffered a split second of pain . The Disintegrator seemed simply to return them to the nothingness from which they had originally come as newborn infants . This would not seem to be murder . Charlie supposed that there was n't even a law against it , because it was unprecedented . But surely there would be one once it was known to be happening . Therefore only trouble could come from anybody 's learning about the Disintegrator . Fortunately the plastic pistol would not be difficult either to conceal or to justify having if it were detected . A super routinely collected lost toys or saw that the sanitation department took away the discarded ones . But of course there could never be any reason why the Disintegrator would be identified for what it was . Only those who had been erased by it would be privy to its extraordinary power  --  and perhaps not even them , were they somehow brought back from the void . Most of the persons at whom Charlie had pointed it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been , like the first mailman , would have seen nothing but the red plastic muzzle , from which came no slug or visible emanation before its target vanished utterly . There had never been anything of this sort in the history of man , and Charlie was aware that he could have used the Disintegrator to rule the world ! He might well have set out to do that had he been younger , but now his digestion was gone and his lower back sometimes ached so much he could n't get to sleep at night , and he really did not yearn forpositive power . Just getting rid of people who annoyed him was a great advantage , and he asked for nothing more than peace in his declining years . However , a strange state of affairs had come into being . Now that Charlie could erase those who bothered him , there were more of them all the time . Whereas when he had been helpless against them , relatively few persons had seriously bothered him on any given day , now , when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such individuals appeared in great numbers wherever he went . At the delicatessen , for example . while waiting in line for a brisket on rye , mustard only , the super was jostled savagely , and at least one other customer unfairly jumped his proper place in line , and when Charlie finally reached the counterman he was insulted by him for being too slow in giving the order ( being momentarily speechless with indignation ) . Really the only way to deal with this situation was to erase everybody in the deli  --  a job that , amazingly , took only a few pulls of the trigger : the Disintegrator could handle any number of persons who were in line with its muzzle . Charlie was soon to test its efficacy on a line before the ticket window at the ballpark , taking out twenty-three persons with one squeeze . Apparently it was like an X ray , going straight through living tissue but having no effect on inorganic matter . Before many days had passed , the effects of Charlie 's erasures began to be evident . Fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the survivors began to wonder audibly what had happened to the missing tenants . Sometimes they unwittingly asked the only man who could have explained : " Hey , Charlie , this place is beginning to look deserted , do n't you think ? " Or . " What 's become of everybody , Charlie ? " At first the super would cast doubt on their powers of observation . " Take it from me , there 's more people around here every day . You just missed a big crowd . " Next , when the reduction in population had become too drastic to ignore , Charlie would say something like : " Oh , everybody gets out of here on weekends nowadays . " And if the response was , " But Charlie , today 's Wednesday , " he might answer : " They stretch it to the breaking point , do n't they ? " and shake his head over the decadence of the typical contemporary jobholder . Finally , when nothing he could dream up would satisfy the inquirer , Charlie would shrug and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one , or sometimes little group by group , the remaining tenants , and soon the entire building was devoid of humanity except for Charlie himself . Now , certainly , the people who had lived there had relatives and friends who missed them , and many individuals came to the building in search of the whereabouts of the former tenants , including representatives of the large real-estate firm that owned the apartment house . Charlie erased all these 59 investigators , and then went downtown to the main office of the firm , his employers , and caused everyone there to disappear . Charlie continued in this fashion for several months , always finding new uses for the Disintegrator . For example , he was aware that even with all his power he was still not desirable to the kind of women , namely young and pretty ones , who now had begun to attract him . He might spot some knockout accompanied by a man and erase the latter , but the girl even so would see no reason why she should take Charlie as replacement for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of replacing all the other males in the city who were younger and/ or better looking than he , and he set about making wholesale erasures with his Disintegrator . This took a few weeks , despite the effectiveness of his device , for there were hundreds of thousands of persons he had to get rid of , but finally it was done , and Charlie was obviously , by default , the best date a woman could find in a city of the aged , the physically disabled , and the harmless mental defectives , and he could take his pick , with the exception of the contrary ones who said that if he was all that was offered they could survive without male friendship  --  naturally , he erased this sort immediately on hearing that argument . But at about this time life for Charlie began to be dissatisfying even though everything was going his way , for in the absence of all ablebodied and sane men a good many of the practical affairs of the city were in a mess . When there was trouble at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to the tiny number of female electrical technicians , and Charlie soon found his own building without lights , air conditioning , TV , or any of the other conveniences afforded by electricity . Most restaurants were closed for the same reason , added to which was the utter absence of garbage-removal workers . The few woman bus and taxi drivers were so overworked that most of them quit their jobs , and with the disappearance of gas-truck drivers , station personnel , and mechanics , the vehicles could not run long anyway , and of course the same was true of private cars . Some of the deprivations did not matter that much : most of the police were gone , but so were almost all of the criminals , except for a few tough girls whom Charlie found it simple to erase when he encountered them . Up to the time of the erasure of the men , television , radio , and the press had given daily attention to the disappearance of so much of the city 's population , and there were all sorts of theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the power failures this stopped , owing to the inability of the information media to continue to function . However , the girls dated by Charlie talked of no other subject , except the inevitable matter of the latestproblem such as lack of refrigeration , so no food could be had but the canned and dehydrated stuff . " Charlie , " they would say , " have you heard this theory ? That all the guys , every one , turned homosexual and went to some community in the desert where they wo n't have to listen to reproaches ? " " Hell with that , " Charlie would growl . " Do n't bother me about that ! " For with all those lonely women at his disposal , he did n't have to worry about being rude . And the fact was that he was getting pretty bored with women in general , now that he had them all to himself , and he was getting really tired of living without electricity , especially now that there were n't many places to go , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a date now he asked the girl why she had n't gone in for a career in technology . " Gee , Charlie , " the young woman would say . " I could have sworn you would have found that unfeminine . Do n't you prefer me as the high-fashion model I am , or anyway was until this current crisis hit the city ? " " I 'd rather have my refrigerator turning out ice cubes , " said Charlie . " I 'd rather not have to go around my apartment carrying a candle . " And in his annoyance with a situation that he had certainly brought on himself , he would erase this person . He had no patience whatever with anybody . He erased the rest of the men , the lame , the halt . and so on , for aesthetic reasons , and he got rid of more and more females because he was exasperated by their uselessness . Finally , without being fully aware of what he had done , Charlie got rid of the last person in town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had made too many jokes for his taste , and then he was all alone in the vast city . A sense of his uniqueness came to him after a day or so , and having taken one of the empty cars that had been abandoned at every curb and driven from one end of town to the other without hearing or seeing anyone , Charlie reflected on his lack of foresight in using the Disintegrator so lavishly , and he understood that such a fool as he should never have had his wish granted . He then turned the muzzle of the Disintegrator on himself and pulled the trigger . It was n't long before people came from other places and repopulated the city and became so involved in their own affairs that the strange disappearance of the original citizenry , never explained , was forgotten except by those periodicals perennially concerned with flying saucers and the Bermuda Triangle . Some kid found the Disintegrator where it had fallen after Charlie 's disappearance , and he pointed it at his friends , a stray dog , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking noise , nothing happened . He was still too young to have any really passionate wishes . ?
