Not anymore . Not only have European and U.S.-born players made well-documented inroads into the league but , somewhat more quietly , college hockey also has become a valued feeder system . Fifteen years ago the NHL had only five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In June 's amateur draft alone , 20 collegians were selected , and another 20 players in last season 's NCAA championship game between North Dakota and Wisconsin had already been drafted by NHL clubs . // Before the awakening , top Canadian players were a tough target for college recruiters . One college coach remembers trying to entice a youngster to his school by telling the boy 's father that his son had the potential to become an All-America . " Oh , no , " said Dad . " I want my boy always to remain Canadian . " Those days are gone . Canadian prospects are aware of the attention pro scouts pay U.S. colleges ( more than 25% of the games the NHL 's Central Scouting staff watches every season are in the U.S. ) . They also see college games on TV ( North Dakota 's , for instance , are televised as far north as Saskatoon ) . " As more players come into the league from the colleges , " says Islander General Manager Bill Torrey , " more kids are saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get an education and play good enough hockey to become a pro . ' " Because Canadian colleges offer few athletic scholarships , the players head south . // A lot of them come to the University of New Hampshire , where Coach Charlie Holt has turned out eight NHL pros in his 14 years in Manchester . Seven were in the league last season . Three-time NCAA champion Boston University also has had its share , as have Clarkson , Boston College and other Eastern College Athletic Conference schools . Nevertheless , hockey is n't as strong in the East as it is in the North Central region of the country , which in the college game is referred to as the West . Minnesota alone had 14 players in the NHL in 1981-82 , and the five other Western Collegiate Hockey Association members  --  North Dakota , Wisconsin , Denver , Colorado College and Minnesota-Duluth  --  contributed a total of 23 . Another 16 came from the four schools that left the WCHA in 1981 to join the Central Collegiate Hockey Association  --  Michigan , Michigan State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long dominated the college game , winning 28 of 35 NCAA titles . The season starts nearly a month earlier in the West ( this week for 17 schools ) than in the East and involves more games ( 35 to 40 vs. 20 to 25 ) . In addition , Western hockey is , by reputation , rougher , which helps attract NHL aspirants , and recruiting is more aggressive than at Eastern schools . One-third of the Division I teams in the East belong to the Ivy League , in which financial aid is based on need . " We operate on need , too , " says North Dakota Coach Gino Gasparini with a smile . " We need a goaltender . We need a defenseman. " // When asked to rank the teams nationally , only one of the 35 college coaches polled by SI rated an Eastern school No. 1 . That was perennial powerhouse Clarkson . Minnesota has seven NHL draftees among its eight blue-chip freshmen , and Michigan State is led by the best goalie in the country , Ron Scott . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NCAAs , chances are the Fighting Sioux will be the team to beat . North Dakota has the best coach in Gasparini ( now that Bob Johnson has gone to the NHL ) and , in James Patrick , a sophomore defenseman , perhaps the best player . // Two years ago Patrick was selected as the best junior Tier II player in Canada , and last season he was Freshman of the Year in the WCHA . Drafted No. 1 by the Rangers in 1981 , he is the only first-round pick ever to put off the pros for college . In fact , Patrick is so good  --  and so fortunate  --  that he has a tough time remembering what it was like to play on a losing hockey team . " When I was 12 our team was one of the worst in the league , " says Patrick , who 's now 19 . " At that age , you 're busy just playing and having fun . But you still hate to lose . I sure did . " // Thousands of young athletes learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Patrick has . Not since he was 13 has a hockey team he has played for failed to win the biggest prize available . After leading Bantam and Minor Midget teams in his native Winnipeg to Western Canada and provincial championships in 1978 and 1979 , respectively , Patrick entered Notre Dame College , a boarding school in tiny Wilcox , Saskatchewan with a marvelous hockey tradition and a fine academic reputation . The Hounds finished with a 67-2-1 record and won the national Midget title in 1980 . The following year , eschewing junior Tier I hockey to keep his college eligibility , Patrick played for the Prince Albert ( Sask . ) Raiders , a Tier II team . They , too , won the national championship , going 57-7-1. // Last season , despite being a No. 1 draft choice and the ninth pick overall , Patrick matriculated at North Dakota . He had five goals and 24 assists as the Fighting Sioux went 35-12 to win their second NCAA championship in three years . Patrick was the only freshman named to the all-tournament team . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Canadian team that won the Junior Worlds , in Minneapolis . " Up to now , every decision James has made has been perfect , " says his father , Steve , a real estate man who was a CFL All-Pro lineman for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers under Bud Grant and a member of the Manitoba Parliament in 1962-77. // While he could stand to beef up his 6 ' 2 " , 192-pound frame , Patrick has what it takes to be a Ranger right now . His defensive partner at Notre Dame and in the Junior Worlds , Gord Kluzak , was the No. 1 pick in the entire NHL draft this year . Barry MacKenzie , who coached them both at Notre Dame , says Patrick was the better player , albeit partly because he is 10 months older . // Why , then , will Patrick be attending an 11 a.m. economics class this fall while Kluzak skates with the Boston Bruins ? " I want to experience university life , " Patrick says . " Plenty of guys are 18 and in the NHL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make lots of money , but a lot of them sign and then end up in the minors , teed off . " // Witness Patrick 's older brother , Steve , 21 , who turned down a scholarship at North Dakota to play for Brandon , Manitoba , one of the top Canadian junior teams , because he was told the move would propel him directly into the NHL . Sure enough , the Buffalo Sabres made Steve their first pick in 1980 , but since then he has been shuttled among Buffalo , Brandon and Rochester of the American Hockey League . " Right now , Steve says if he had it to do over again , he would go to college , " says James . // Grand Forks , the original home of Cream of Wheat and one of the few places in the world that have legalized gambling with a $2 maximum ( in casinos and hotel lounges ) , is a grand place to play college hockey . As the only Division I sport in the state , hockey outdraws every other sport at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , teaches a rough brand of hockey , emphasizing defense , and Patrick practices what the coach preaches . " James has extreme quickness and a tremendous knowledge of the game , " says Gasparini . " He can make a play in open ice , and when there 's a lot of traffic , as well . " // " I can handle the puck and skate with it good , " says Patrick , " but that should n't take away from my defensive play . At the Junior Worlds , Gord and I had only one goal scored on us in seven games . " // " At first , people could n't figure out why he was drafted in the first round , " says Goalie Darren Jensen . " Some said , ' Maybe we 've been gypped . This guy is n't so great . ' But he does everything to a T. He makes it look so easy . " // Sometimes Patrick does n't even have to show up to be recognized . For finishing second in the RPI Invitational , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Junior Worlds , the Sioux were given a wristwatch . One watch for the whole team . Gasparini let the players decide what to do with it . By season 's end , they had : It went to the player with the best plus-minus total  --  Patrick . // Evidently , they had n't been gypped.
