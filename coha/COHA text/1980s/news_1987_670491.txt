Well , from the long reservation lists at the Four Seasons and La Caravelle and other favorites of the expense-account set in New York and elsewhere , nothing appears to have changed . Nor could one tell from the brisk sale of seats for Broadway shows and of season box tickets for the Mets , Yankees and other baseball teams . <> <> Business ' as Good as Ever ' // " I was a little worried about it , but right now I am relieved , " said Andre Soltner , owner of Lutece . " Business is as good as ever. " // Apparently undaunted by the tighter tax rules - under which only 80 percent of most entertainment and meal expenses are deductible instead of the full amount - executives and sales representatives are continuing to spend billions of dollars wining and dining clients and customers. // While precise figures have not been calculated since the new rules went into effect Jan. 1 , the spending seems as free as before , even though the Government is now picking up less of the tab. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Albert Ellentuck , national tax partner at the accounting firm of Laventhol &; Horwath , a specialist in advising small and medium-size companies . " I think it ' s inevitable that there will be some tightening up later because companies will be seeing that it ' s going to cost more. " // But for now , " it ' s basically business as usual , " according to Donald Tannenbaum , managing partner of the accounting firm of Oppenheim , Appel , Dixon &; Company . " The additional cost is just going to be a cost of business. " // Such is the case at the Tonka Corporation , a toy manufacturer that has not changed its expense-account policies despite the change in the law . " We already try to manage that type of expense to the point where it is necessary for business , " said Stephen G. Shank , the company ' s president and chief executive . " I have not heard this as being a matter of high concern at other companies. " // " It ' s important for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William P. Madar , president and chief executive of the Nordson Corporation , an Ohio industrial products company , which has not changed its policies , either . " The tax changes can ' t swing these decisions . You just roll it over and pay the taxes at the end of the day . " <> <> Change in Expense Forms // So far , one of the few visible signs of the changes has been the introduction by hundreds of companies of new forms to keep track of different types of employee expenses . The forms typically have separate listings for expenses that are fully deductible , 80 percent deductible or nondeductible. // The new law " turns out to be more of an aggravation in terms of recordkeeping than a burden on expenses , " said John V. Roach , president and chief executive of the Tandy Corporation. // The 20 percent reduction in deductibility is not the only change under the new rules , part of the sweeping Tax Reform Act of 1986 . The value of the deduction is further diminished because of lower corporate income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of entertainment and meal expenses by 35 percent . For example , a $200 bill for dinner and theater that used to cost a company $108 after taxes costs $145. 60 under the new law. // Moreover , the new rules require that business be a major topic of discussion during the meal . Under the old law there was no requirement that business affairs even be touched on , although there had to be a business purpose for having the meal in the first place. // The changes are expected to save the Government some $11. 1 billion over the next five years , according to the Treasury Department ' s Office of Tax Policy. // A recent survey by the American Express Company found that travel , entertainment and meal expenses are the third-largest expense at most companies , trailing only salaries and data processing . At least $90 billion was spent by businesses on meals and entertainment in 1986 , according to the survey. // During the tax debate in Congress last year , restaurateurs , theater operators and sports promoters lobbied vigorously to retain full deductibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , however , some industry groups concede that their fears may have been unwarranted , at least for the short term. // A Chase Econometrics study commissioned by the National Restaurant Association , for example , predicted that the industry could lose as many as 342 , 000 jobs and $8. 9 billion in sales this year because of the change . The industry has eight million full- and part-time jobs and revenues of $200 billion. // " We have not begun to feel it yet , " Jeffrey R. Prince , senior director of the Washington-based association , said of the projected drop in sales . " It ' s our hope that even though it costs more to continue these meals , companies won ' t reduce them because they are important to their businesses. " // Similarly , neither professional sports organizations nor theater operators have reported a drop in ticket sales . <> <> ' Selling to Capacity ' // " We have shows that are selling to capacity , " said Arthur Rubin , general manager of Nederlander productions , owners of theaters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax proposal was debated , " We obviously said it would hurt us because we were trying to defeat the bill . " He cautioned that it remained difficult to assess the long-term effects. // " I don ' t believe that the new tax laws will have an impact on the sale of season tickets , " said A. Bartlett Giamatti , president of the National League . " What will determine baseball ticket sales is how well the teams are doing. " // The Mets , for instance , coming off their victory in the World Series last year , expect to surpass last season ' s record sales of more than three million tickets . And the Yankees , who did not have quite as winning a record , report that season-ticket sales are up more than 20 percent over the comparable period last year. // " I know it will be more costly for corporations , " said Harvey Greene , spokesman for the Yankees , " but as long as we stay competitive we ' ll do good business. " // Mr. Giamatti said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the Pacific Coast , no one expressed concern that the new tax laws would hurt sales . Last season , businesses accounted for about 45 percent of the purchases of season passes . It remains too early to tell the effect of the Tax Reform Act on the sale of skyboxes , those luxurious rooms in sports stadiums and arenas that often contain televisions and bars , because the deduction for them under the new rules is sharply reduced over the next three years . <> <> Cutbacks May Still Be Ahead // Though the effect of the tax change has been negligible so far , some observers say companies will start to cut back on entertainment and meal expenses over the next year or so. // " As a matter of economic theory , the lower rates and higher expenses should mean cuts , " said A. Gary Shilling , an economic consultant . " Our clients are taking a hard look at it , but these things don ' t get changed overnight. " // He said that most 1987 company expense budgets were set before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a gradual shift , " Mr. Shilling said . " We may start to see it next year or in the second half of this year . It ' s a serious concern , but it ' s more in the ' to do ' stage than in the ' do now ' stage. " //
