The annual State of the State address by the governor of Massachusetts and a trip to New York City by Boston ' s mayor to discuss the city ' s financial needs with investment bankers will focus attention this week on the affairs of the state and the city . At the same time , two trials - one involving a suspended state official charged with corruption , the other a Newport millionaire accused of attempting to murder his wife - are also expected to compete for headlines in the week ahead . The trial of Barry M. Locke , the former state secretary of transportation and chairman of the MBTA board of directors , begins today with jury selection in Suffolk Superior Court . Locke was suspended from his job last May amidst allegations that a package addressed to him , which contained ten $100 bills , was evidence of a payoff scheme . He is charged with 17 counts of bribery , larceny and attempts to commit bribery and larceny . The money was discovered on April 30 by MBTA General Manager James F. O ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O ' Leary turned the money over to Atty . Gen. Francis X. Bellotti , which triggered an investigation of Locke . Locke has testified in pre-trial hearings that the $1000 was intended to pay back a loan . Before the trial is over , more than 40 witnesses are expected to testify . One of the government ' s star witnesses is Frank J. Walters Jr. , a former MBTA employee who , a year ago , was one of Locke ' s best friends . In Newport , R.I. , the trial of Claus von Bulow , a social figure in Newport , also begins today . The Newport millionaire is accused of administering repeated dosages of insulin to his wife - enough to cause her to lapse into a coma in December 1980 . She has been unconscious since . Von Bulow , who has been married to Martha ( Sunny ) von Bulow for 15 years , will claim that his wife was a self-destructive woman who brought about her comatose condition through abusive use of drugs and alcohol . The prosecution will seek to prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state ' s key witnesses is a maid employed by Martha von Bulow for 23 years , who claims that she found syringes and vials of drugs in a black bag owned by Claus von Bulow . Boston Mayor Kevin H. White left for New York City yesterday for meetings today with investment bankers who have financed municipal bonds for Boston . The mayor will tell the bankers that by the spring , he is hopeful the city will receive the legislative authorization it needs to borrow up to $75 million in muncipal bonds and ease its financial constrictions . White , who will take a two-week vacation after his meeting with New York bankers , leaves behind a city that has yet to find a solution to financial woes caused by the combination of the tax- cutting measure , Proposition 2 1/2 , and a court order requiring the city to pay some $75 million in property tax abatements . The state Legislature has refused to approve a bill to give the city authorization to borrow the money . A week ago , in his 15th annual " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston - short of money , services and solutions - was in trouble as it headed into 1982 . The city ' s firefighters may be the first to feel the sting of the mayor ' s somber assessment of the problems ahead . The president of the local firefighter ' s union warned last week that the city plans to lay off up to 200 more firefighters and close an additional 20 fire companies . Fire Comr . George Paul has declined to comment on the union ' s statements . Tomorrow , Gov . Edward J. King is scheduled to give the annual State of the State address , his fourth since winning election in November 1978 . He faces challenges from nine announced candidates , including two from his own party , in this election year . The first challenge from his own party came last summer from Lt. Gov . Thomas P. O ' Neill 3d . Yesterday , former Massachusetts governor Michael S. Dukakis officially announced his campaign to regain the governorship . So far , seven Republicans have also formally announced their candidacies for governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
