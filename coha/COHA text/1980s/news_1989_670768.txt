Mr. de Mare made his debut in 1986 , after he won a Young Concert Artists audition , and since then has been pursuing a career that involves overcoming a certain amount of resistance . " People have preconceived notions about contemporary music , " he said in an interview the other day . " But when you show people what has been going on in composition over the last 20 years - how music has branched out in all directions - they get excited about it. " // " There was a long period , " he continued , " when Serialism dominated new music , and when we lost a large part of the audience because composers were writing for themselves , and listeners couldn ' t understand the music . But with post-modernism as a stepping stone , audiences have started to come back. // " How do I define post-modernism ? Basically , I think of it as a reaction against Serialism . For too long , it has been used to mean only Minimalism . But now there is a generation of younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who are fusing those idioms , along with elements of jazz , rock and pop , and writing what they want . Part of my purpose is to show that wide variety . " <> <> Taking Variety Seriously // Variety , in fact , is a notion Mr. de Mare takes very seriously . Among the works on tonight ' s program are a rhythmic , Latin-flavored work by Ricard Lorenz , a Venezuelan composer ; the United States premiere of " Dreamlandscapes , Book 2 " by Douglas Young , a British composer who works in a more traditionally thorny academic style , and the New York premiere of James Sellars ' s " Patterns on a Field , " which the pianist says uses figuration that suggests a rock-and-roll vamp . There are a couple of modernist oldies - works by Charles Ives and Conlon Nancarrow - and a Lullaby by Aaron Kernis that the pianist describes as " a comment on Mahler. " // The works that will take him farthest afield , however , are Mr. Rzewski ' s " Lost and Found , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own arrangement of Ms. Monk ' s " Double Fiesta. " // " The Rzewski was originally written for a percussionist , " Mr. de Mare explained . " In fact , it doesn ' t use the piano at all - it uses a table and a chair . What he ' s done is , he has taken a letter in which a lieutenant in Vietnam writes home to his family about a class he gave in ambushes , for which he was commended . In the letter , he is clearly patting himself on the back . But the stage actions , which interrupt the reading , show the emotional unconscious . Some are gruff , some are bizarre ; but basically , he ' s beating himself up . It ' s theater , but I think body movement can be very musical . " <> <> Piano Aplenty in Monk ' s Work // Ms. Monk ' s work , on the other hand , uses plenty of piano : Mr. De Mare ' s is a solo version of a two-piano score . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of her works . Mr. de Mare , who has performed other works by Ms. Monk , is not in the least inhibited about this . He has also had a good deal of training in it , having performed with Ms. Monk ' s House ensemble between 1985 and 1987. // Mr. de Mare was born in Rochester , and became interested in contemporary music when his first piano teacher had him learn works by Khachaturian , Prokofiev and Debussy . " I also studied standard repertory works when I was in high school and college , " he recalled , " but I felt a greater affinity for music of this century . I found it more interesting , more challenging , something I could make a stronger personal statement with . And the more I heard , the more I wanted to investigate it all.

" In terms of scores and recordings , " Mr. de Mare said , " it was like being in a candy store . " <> <> Urged to Enter Competitions // Mr. Mikhashoff had his student devote a year to music composed between 1900 and 1950 , and a year working up to the present . He also encouraged Mr. de Mare to enter new-music performance competitions . In 1982 , Mr. de Mare won first prize at the Gaudeamus Competition , in the Netherlands ; and in 1983 , he won first prize at the Competition of Contemporary Piano Music in St.-Germain-en-Laye , France . These days , his repertory list is four pages long , and includes nothing earlier than Debussy. // " The list gets updated all the time , " he said , " because sometimes there are works composed for specific concerts . The difficulty with a new-music career is that you have to learn a lot of music very quickly . I am very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what works to play , and it varies with where the concert is . Often I play a lot of shorter pieces . Why ? Because when I program long works , only three or four composers are represented , and I begin to feel guilty - as though I ' m not acknowledging certain areas of contemporary composition that I want people to hear. // " I am aware that some people think of all-contemporary concerts as a kind of ghettoization . I don ' t see it that way . There are a lot of people who play standard repertory works beautifully , and not enough playing the new repertory. " //
