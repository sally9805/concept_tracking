The question from Secretary of State George Shultz was one that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir did not really want to answer . He remained silent , apparently in deep thought . " On that issue , " he finally said , " I will have to consult my Foreign Minister . " For a moment , the American negotiators said nothing . Then they remembered that Shamir , who had been Menachem Begin 's Foreign Minister , had never relinquished that title . In the ensuing laughter , Shamir achieved his aim : the question was forgotten . <P> That kind of finesse from a man not given to small talk or wordplay was seen by some of his aides as symbolic of Shamir 's growing self-confidence since stepping out from Begin 's shadow and into Israel 's most demanding office just eight weeks ago . " He behaved like a real Prime Minister , " said a top Israeli general who had observed Shamir throughout the Washington negotiations . " He was to the point , all businesslike , and ready to listen . He surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shamir 's aims in visiting Washington . Explained one of his aides : " He came to deliver a clear message : that he is ready to lead Israel ; that he is not a Prime Minister for a limited period ; that everything is open for negotiations . " <P> Under the intense and volatile Begin , Shamir had kept a prudently low profile , first as Speaker of the Knesset and then as Foreign Minister . He watched Begin chew up such outspoken potential challengers as Moshe Dayan and Ezer Weizman . Says an " aide who has worked closely with Shamir for four years : " His calculation was the right one . " <P> Although Shamir , 68 , lost most of his family in Poland during the Holocaust , he seems less traumatized than Begin about the past . Unlike Begin , he shuns the Talmudic obsession with verbal precision , concentrating instead on the practical reality that the words are meant to address . An uninspired and an uninspiring speaker , Shamir is also less divisive than Begin . He has few intimates outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 38 , an air force pilot , and daughter Gilada , 34 ) . " He is sphinxlike , " says Knesset Member Amnon Rubinstein . That befits a man who was a leader of the terrorist underground before Israel 's independence and a covert agent and high official of Israel 's intelligence agency , MOSSAD . ( Even his surname had been a deception ; born Jazernicki , he chose the new identity after escaping from a British prison in 1943 . ) When it comes to Israel 's basic security interests , those few who do know Shamir expect him to be at least as tough as Begin . <P> The key difference between the men may be that Shamir cares less about dogma than Begin did and seems more open to new approaches to the old Middle East problems . Where Begin heatedly dismissed the Palestine Liberation Organization as " the Nazis of the Middle East , " Shamir , says an aide , " believes that the Palestinians are human beings with their own ambitions and expectations , forming a human community the Israelis should learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has conveyed to aides his belief that Israel is part of the Arab Middle East and should not close itself into " a modern Jewish ghetto.
