Ordinary folks are likely to forget about letters , memos or grocery lists that they have jotted down ; it takes someone a little unusual to lose all recollection of having written a book . That is what happened to Author Graham Greene , 80 , who learned in 1983 that something of his called The Tenth Man had been unearthed from the archives of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . He remembered working under contract to MGM back in 1944 and thought he might have written a brief scenario of a story that could , conceivably , have borne that title . But when the discovered typescript was sent to him , as Greene notes in an introduction , he was astonished : " It proved to be not two pages of outline but a complete short novel of about 30,000 words . What surprised and aggravated me most of all was that I found this forgotten story very readable . " <P> Few of Greene 's constant readers will disagree . The Tenth Man offers , in small compass , the narrative combination that eventually became recognized as the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the hero must struggle not only for his life but for his soul . <P> Jean-Louis Chavel is one of 30 Frenchmen being held in a small prison block by the occupying German army . Chavel , a lawyer before the war , and his fellow detainees know exactly why their captors provide them food and shelter : the involuntary guests are hostages , meant to discourage local Resistance violence against the Nazis . This deterrent , of course , does not work . Two Germans are killed , and the order comes down from the prison commander : one out of every ten prisoners is to be executed at sunrise . The men themselves must choose the victims . Lots are drawn , and Chavel finds himself one of the three losers . As the only " man of position and property " among them , the lawyer keenly feels injustice and fear . He offers money and then all of his possessions , including his ancestral home , to the one who will take his place before the firing squad . Against all expectations he finds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailing mother to survive him as wealthy women . <P> Those who have spent time familiarizing themselves with the topography of Greeneland will have some idea of what must happen next . France is liberated and so is Chavel , who emerges from prison with papers that identify him as one Jean-Louis Charlot . Having lost everything but his life , the survivor feels driven inexorably toward the home he has relinquished . There he meets his unsuspecting inheritors : an old woman who knows nothing of the fate of her son and a sister who can think of little else . Therese gives the ragged visitor food and discusses the horrible man who bought her brother 's death : " I tell myself that one day he will come back here because he wo n't be able to resist seeing what 's happened to his beautiful house . " And when he does ? the uneasy Chavel wonders aloud . The reply : " I 'd spit in his face . "                   @ @
