' ' The house was mortgaged , and she didn ' t even have enough money to make the payments , ' ' explains Viola Dodge , president of Kansas Agri-Women in Olsburg , Kan . Although the widow contested the will and eventually received a better settlement , legal fees further eroded her share of the estate. // Her experience illustrates the economic vulnerability of women in states where property laws allow unequal control of marital property . Only nine states have community property laws , which divide marital property 50-50. // // ' ' In most states a married woman has no right to knowledge of , control over , or access to the family assets during the marriage , ' ' says Eleanor Smeal , president of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) . Marital property laws in the United States , she adds , generally do not recognize that marriage is a partnership , with each spouse making a different but equally important contribution. // To strengthen that economic partnership , NOW is launching a nationwide campaign to guarantee the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a national policy to protect the property rights of each spouse during marriage , at the death of a spouse , and at divorce. // The group advocates equal protection of the law for the marital property rights of each spouse . It calls for equal ownership of property and assets acquired during marriage , including pensions , retirement benefits , and other career assets . It also seeks to require couples to disclose information to each other about assets and liabilities , and to act together in buying , selling , or mortgaging real estate. // These changes are necessary , Ms. Smeal argues , because current laws ' ' encourage deception . We are contributing to a climate that enables a man to tell his wife what he chooses . Why should we have a system of laws that allow somebody to cheat others ? // ' ' We say to people , ' Don ' t leave the keys in the car and the motor running - it ' s a temptation for someone to take it . ' But aren ' t we tempting people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breakdown of the family ? ' ' // Under current law , says Eleanor Revelle , vice-president for advocacy of the Illinois League of Women Voters , ' ' It ' s very easy for a title-holding spouse to leave all the property to a third party by means of joint tenancy , a trust , or a life insurance policy . If you use non-probate means of transferring property , the property does not pass through the estate and goes directly to the surviving joint tenant or the beneficiary of the trust or the life insurance policy. // ' ' Most people will say it ' s against the law to disinherit a spouse , ' ' she continues . ' ' That ' s true if the person has left all their property by will to a third person , because then the surviving spouse can renounce the will . If that happens then the surviving spouse gets between one-third and one-half of the property in the will . But what people don ' t realize is that there are these other non-probate means of transferring property. ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , designed to serve as a model for nationwide standardization , at the death of a spouse the surviving partner would automatically own half the marital property . This includes property the deceased spouse holds jointly with another person . A spouse would have the right to will up to half the marital property to someone else . A husband and wife can retain as separate property anything they brought to the marriage , and any inheritances . They can also draw up agreements to set up different ownership arrangements. // Revised marital property laws could also help in divorce settlements . According to Lenore Weitzman , a task force member and author of ' ' The Divorce Revolution , ' ' women ' s standard of living decreases by an average of 73 percent after divorce , while men ' s increases by 42 percent , in part because of inequitable laws governing marital property , ownership , and distribution . Under UMPA , both parties would come to court with an equal legal claim to assets , although the law would not guarantee an equal distribution. // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives - among them passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and adoption of the NOW Homemakers ' Bill of Rights as public policy - would help to promote women ' s economic equality. // She also proposes adding a sentence , called the ' ' Bonnie law , ' ' to federal income tax forms . It states that anything on the statement that is jointly reported is assumed to be jointly owned. // Smeal explains : ' ' When you sign a joint income tax return , you ' re equally liable for any misstatement , even if you ' ve never had access to the books . If you ' re responsible for anything that goes wrong , there should be a presumption that it ' s equally yours if there ' s something right . This is such a simple way for millions of women to establish that they have a right to whatever happened during that year. ' ' // The task force is also calling for educational measures , such as state laws requiring that applicants for marriage licenses be given a pamphlet explaining the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men know their rights , they will work for change , ' ' says Smeal. // Not everyone wants that change . ' ' There ' s a lot of residual opposition out there , ' ' says William Cantwell , a Denver attorney who was instrumental in drafting the Uniform Marital Property Act in 1983 . ' ' It ' s very unusual to find any strong group of male lawyers who come quickly and naturally to the beauty of this idea , ' ' he adds wryly. // Yet acceptance is growing , task force members report. // ' ' Young people are much more amenable to this than older people , ' ' says Dorothy Jonas , chairman of the task force. // Although recent reforms in Wisconsin , Louisiana , and California represent progress , property law experts emphasize the importance of a national approach . The distribution of marital property ' ' shouldn ' t depend on which state you live in , ' ' says Kim Gandy , an attorney in New Orleans . ' ' It should be based on equity . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too spotty , ' ' Smeal adds. // Pointing out that love is ' ' not just words , it ' s deeds , ' ' she sums up : ' ' If from the beginning of a marriage you know that when you acquire things , you must by law share that information with your spouse , it would create an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding much more than we have now . Marital property laws should help create a climate of loving and understanding . You trust if there is openness and nothing to hide. ' ' // //
