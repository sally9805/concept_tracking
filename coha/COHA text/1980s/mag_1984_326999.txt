Humana offers proof that health is a sound investment <P> The sight of William Schroeder joking with his family last week was the best possible advertisement not just for the miracles of science but for Humana , the investor-owned medical conglomerate . In the fast-growing U.S. health care industry , investor-owned companies are challenging nonprofit organizations and community hospitals for a greater share of the nearly $1 billion-a-day business . Profitmaking companies now own or manage more than 20% of all U.S. hospitals , double the percentage of five years ago . Moreover , they are moving rapidly into affiliated areas such as health maintenance organizations , satellite clinics and surgical-equipment firms . <P> Humana ( fiscal-year 1984 revenues : $2.6 billion ) is the most aggressive of the companies that believe medicine is a calling for businessmen as well as doctors . But though it has 91 hospitals in 22 states and three foreign countries , Humana is not the largest hospital chain . Still bigger , for example , is Hospital Corp . of America ( estimated 1984 revenues : $4.2 billion ) . Last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 1979 . <P> Two Louisville lawyers , David Jones and Wendell Cherry , started Humana in 1962 with one Kentucky nursing home and $1,000 of borrowed money . Their business strategy was to bring innovative management techniques to a field noted more for compassion than cost efficiency . Says Cherry : " When I started to talk with physicians about what we were doing-marketing to the customer-some did n't like the word customer . " <P> Known as Heritage House of America at first , the company by 1968 had ten nursing homes and revenues of $4.8 million . <P> That year Jones and Cherry realized that hospitals were earning six times as much per patient as nursing homes because of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements , so they built their first hospital . In 1968 the company made its first public stock offering at $8 a share . <P> In 1972 Humana sold its nursing homes , then numbering 41 , for $ 14 million in order to concentrate on hospitals . Jones and Cherry at the time were buying a hospital a month , mostly from groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors had been running them for decades . What was new was the idea of linking them in large chains . <P> Today Humana has general hospitals from Geneva to Anchorage . Though Jones , 52 , and Cherry , 49 , resist the notion that their chain was modeled on the McDonald 's restaurant company , the two corporations are based on similar retail philosophies . Humana 's guidelines : consistency , quality and high-volume , affordable care .
