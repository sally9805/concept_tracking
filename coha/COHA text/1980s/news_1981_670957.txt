From that came a confrontation between a militant black labor union and a multinational company , the dismissal of 470 black workers , a call for a candy boycott , some firebombings and the jailing of 57 union men by the security police of a black " homeland. " // The union involved in the conflict , the South African Allied Workers Union , has been prominent on the increasingly turbulent South African labor scene because it insists on voicing the political grievances of black workers and refuses to play by the relatively rigid rules of an industrial conciliation system in which the rights of black unions were first recognized less than two years ago. // The response by employers and the police in this Indian Ocean port provides an especially sharp example of the industrial and political power struggles that have been set off across the country by the granting of black trade union rights . The Allied Workers Union claims to have organized 16 , 000 workers here since it came into existence in East London last year , but more than 2 , 000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in union protests. // // Only One Company Signs Accord // At least eight foreign-owned companies have negotiated with the union on terms for its recognition but only one has actually signed an agreement . Direct and indirect pressure from the authorities , who obviously view this union with extreme suspicion , has been a major factor in the reluctance of the others to conclude accords. // ( On Friday night , in the latest development , security policemen raided the office of the union in East London and arrested three men , including its national president , a 29-year-old former furniture salesman named Thozamile Gqweta , who spent 117 days in detention last year. ) // The union ' s vice president , Sisa Nijikelana was arrested in Johannesburg a month ago at the start of a police crackdown on black labor and student activists , and has been held without charge ever since. // In the same crackdown , much of the leadership of a similarly assertive black union in the industrial city of Port Elizabeth , the Motor Workers Assembly and Components Workers Union , has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not appear , as yet , to have weakened the Allied Workers Union ' s hold on black workers here . As an example of the pressure under which it is operating , the union is about to be evicted from its offices in East London , although it is not in arrears on its rent . But such setbacks seem to be accepted by its members as evidence that it is pursuing their interests. <> <> 1 , 000 Attend Protest Rally // Last night a standing-room crowd of more than 1 , 000 filled the East London City Hall for a rally to protest the jailing of the workers from the Wilson-Rowntree candy factory by black authorities in the Ciskei , a so-called " national state " that is due to be proclaimed independent later this year. // Almost all of East London ' s black work force is nominally Ciskeian because the borders of the black state have been gerrymandered to include the city ' s sprawling black township , Mdantsane . The regime that governs the Ciskei , a one-party state , is even more hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than white South Africa . All trade union activities are barred in the homeland , including meetings , with the paradoxical effect that East London ' s white business district serves as a kind of refuge for black labor activities. // The City Hall meeting unexpectedly turned into a celebration , for 21 of the 57 union men held in the Ciskei had just been released after 81 days in detention . The 21 included all the members of the former workers committee at the Wilson-Rowntree factory plus all of the union ' s former shop stewards there. // " If the Ciskei is interested in fulfilling the needs of the people , then why does it detain us when we fight for what belongs to us ? " Thozamile Gqweta , the union president , asked in a speech in which he assailed the plans for the territory ' s independence . " Mdantsane belongs in South Africa . We work in South Africa . We are still economically dependent on South Africa . We are workers of South Africa . " <> <> Union Leader Tells of Dispute // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose , Mr. Gqweta recounted the tangled history of the dispute that started at the toffee-wrapping machine. // In his version , three union men were ordered to change a belt on the machine after having previously been instructed in writing not to do so . When they refused , he said , they were dismissed and when others protested their dismissal , they were dismissed too . The management of the company set up the dispute as a provocation , he charged , because the union had refused to seek formal registration under the industrial conciliation system. // The labor leader ' s version was later contradicted in nearly all essential details by Peter H. Preston , a South African who is managing director of the British-owned company . Mr. Preston acknowledged that the union had appeared to have the support of a majority of the black workers at the plant when the dispute broke out but he charged that it had schemed to provoke a walkout. // The three workers , he said , changed the belt on the toffee-wrapping machine routinely on every shift and had never received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an issue of formal registration but had only been concerned that a majority of its workers , those of mixed race who are classified as " coloreds , " not be forced to belong to the black union against their will. // The managing disrector said his company was " most embarrassed " by the jailings in the Ciskei , which occurred after it started to hire new workers to replace the black union members it had dismissed. //
