Only 20% of registered voters participated last week in elections for the Indian chamber of South Africa 's new tricameral Parliament . That unenthusiastic showing came a week after a tepid 30% turnout in balloting for the colored ( mixed-race ) chamber . The two new houses , which will augment South Africa 's previously whites-only Parliament , were set up under a new constitution overwhelmingly approved by white voters last fall . The additional chambers will have authority to pass legislation affecting the nation 's 850,000 Indians and 2.8 million coloreds . But real power will remain with the 4.7 million whites . No power goes to the more than 23 million blacks , an omission that has soured many Indians and coloreds on their new voice in government . <P> Opposition turned violent near Johannesburg , where more than 100 people were injured as police used tear gas and sjamboks ( whips made of hide ) against Indian demonstrators . Prime Minister Pieter W. Botha is nonetheless determined to proceed with the three-part Parliament , which will begin deliberations in Cape Town later this month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
