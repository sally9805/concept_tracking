A newly divorced mom ( Dianne Wiest ) moves with her two sons to the California coastal town of Santa Clara , little suspecting that the community ' s problem youths are no ordinary punks . In a case of peer pressure run amok , her oldest is enlisted into the ranks of the suburban undead , and it ' s up to young Sam ( Corey Haim ) to wrest his older brother , Michael ( Jason Patric ) , from the clutches of the local teen-age vampire pack. // Joel Schumacher ' s film is a " hip , comic twist on classic vampire stories , " Caryn James wrote in The Times . " It laughs at the form it embraces , adds a rock-and-roll soundtrack and , if you share its serious-satiric attitude , manages to be very funny.
