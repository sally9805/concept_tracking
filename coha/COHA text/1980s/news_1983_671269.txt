Allan Kozinn writes frequently about music and musicians . These days , of course , the Brandenburgs are so frequently performed and recorded that they have become almost emblematic of the Baroque orchestral esthetic . Their esteem has not been unfairly earned : Richly endowed with Bach ' s melodic and contrapuntal invention , they are marvels of the concerto grosso form ; and taken as a set , they offer an extensive but concise overview of a good Baroque chamber orchestra ' s capabilities and timbral resources . They have also proven to be quite adaptable : In the few decades since the Baroque revival returned them to currency , the Brandenburgs have been offered in many guises , from Stokowski ' s full-blown Romantic orchestrations and Wendy Carlos ' s synthesizer adaptations , to scaled-down chamber versions , performed on original instruments. // By now , most collectors who have ever considered acquiring a set of Brandenburgs have already done so ; and anyone with a special interest in Bach , or in the Baroque era , probably owns several sets that reflect different viewpoints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several among the latest entries indicate that the interpretive possibilities the works offer have not yet been exhausted. // // One ensemble that has consistently shown imagination and originality in its recordings of familiar Baroque works is the English Concert , a London-based original instruments group , directed from the harpsichord by Trevor Pinnock . Even considering the hefty competition from classic recordings already in the catalogue , this ensemble ' s traversal of the Brandenburgs ( Archiv 2742 003 , two digital disks ) deserves a place near the top of the list. // Mr. Pinnock and his players seem to enjoy brisk tempos , which , combined with their precision ensemble playing and fresh , buoyant phrasing , give each of these familiar scores a new luster . Now and then , balances may seem a little unusual - in the first concerto , for instance , where the natural horns are especially prominent ; and at times , Mr. Pinnock ' s ideas about phrasing and emphasis within phrases pose a direct and provocative challenge to the generally accepted interpretations . But the performance here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also recently recorded a set of Brandenburgs on original instruments , with the Linde Consort , and their version ( Angel DSB-3930 , two digital disks ) shares many fine points with the English Concert ' s - the most important being an almost palpable enthusiasm . Tempos are generally a bit slower than the English Concert ' s , but the requisite energy is there . Here too , balances and phrasing are rethought , and there is much to admire in the interpretations of several of the concertos . Yet , if Mr. Pinnock ' s phrasings seem provocative at first , and convincing on reflection , Mr. Linde ' s innovations are sometimes a bit stilted . Moreover , his players are not quite as virtuosic as Mr. Pinnock ' s , and at times , their intonation is less than impeccable. // // Ars Musica , an original instruments group based in Ann Arbor , Mich. , has ideas of its own about the Brandenburgs , some of which can be examined on a single disk that contains the fourth and fifth concertos ( Timegate TG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , but it is worth seeking out : Lyndon Lawless draws crisp but comfortable readings from the group , whose playing is as accurate as it is exuberant . The disk ' s one drawback is its sometimes too " live " sonic ambiance - a rich , warm sound that occasionally makes the individual wind and string timbres melt together. // The first set of Brandenburgs to be released in the Compact Disk format is , predictably , a superstar version : Joining Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields are the violinist Henryk Szeryng ; the oboist Heinz Holliger ; the flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal ; the trumpet player Andre Bernard ; the harpsichordist George Malcolm ; and the recorder player Michala Petri ( Philips 400 076-2 , and 400 007-2 ; two CDs , sold separately ; or , 6769 058 , two LPs ) . Some of the soloists make fine contributions - notably Michala Petri and George Malcolm - and at times the players make brief and somewhat Romanticized stabs at embellishment . But there is little here to draw the listener into the music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been hailed as the picture of taste ; compared with any of the versions noted above , however , it seems bland and heavy-handed. // Beyond the Brandenburgs , new disk releases of Baroque music include some attractive Telemann and Handel disks . One of these , featuring the Aulos ensemble ( Musical Heritage Society MHS 824572T , two digital disks ) exhibits only Handel ' s name and likeness on its cover , but contains two works by Telemann , a few more by composers whose identities have not been ascertained , and a few by Handel . All these works , we learn from the notes by Richard Taruskin , the ensemble ' s gambist , had been attributed to Handel in the past , and some had become quite familiar as Handel scores before their dubious origins were discovered. // // It ' s not difficult to spot the " real " Handel works amid the fakes - for one thing , the Handel scores borrow lines from other works of the composer ' s , most notably from his " Water Music " Suites . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharper profile than the others , although all eight works ( diverse concertos , sonatas and trio sonatas ) are played with a magnificent sense of spirit and plenty of expressive nuance . Especially captivating are a pair of sonatas for viola da gamba - one authentic Handel , the other now said to be by Johann Mathias Leffloth - works to which Mr. Taruskin brings a full-bodied tone that he alternately casts in bright and dark hues. // On a larger scale , the English Concert offers Handel ' s 12 Concerti Grossi , Op. 6 ( Archiv 2742 002 , three digital disks ) . Composed in 1739 , these concertos were published as a set ; but they were performed one or two at a time , at concerts spaced throughout the winter of 1739-40 . Unlike the Brandenburgs , these can be difficult to get through at a sitting - a side or two at a time will be enough to satisfy most tastes . That ' s not to say that they lack variety , but while some of the concertos - the regal fifth concerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their charms more slowly . As in the Brandenburg set , the English Concert serves up ideal accounts of these dozen works - zesty and propulsive , and richly textured. // The English Concert ' s primary rival these days is another London-based group , the Academy of Ancient Music , led by the harpsichordist Christopher Hogwood . That ensemble has been more active in the recording studio - its best- known effort being its justly renowned Mozart Symphony series . Most of the group ' s recordings are of pre-Classic scores , however , and one recent disk is devoted to double and triple concertos of Telemann ( L ' Oiseau Lyre DSDL 701 , digital ) . An interesting stylistic cross section drawn from Telemann ' s copious output , the disk contains five works , each an individualistic gem. // Among these is a stately concerto for three trumpets , timpani and strings ; and a brief but chromatically attractive example of Telemann ' s contribution to the transitional quartet literature , complete with continuo . The first side ends with a concerto for flute and recorder that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telemann - until the wild finale , a hearty Presto that shows the influence of the folk music Telemann heard while serving as Kapellmeister to a Polish count . Those influences are even more manifest in the works on the second side of the disk , the Concerto Polonais and a concerto for flute , oboe d ' amore and viola d ' amore . In the concertos , the solo playing couldn ' t be more secure , and throughout the disk , the Academy ' s ensemble is finely polished , as always. // //
