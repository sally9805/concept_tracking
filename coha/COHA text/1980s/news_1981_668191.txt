HUDSON , N.H. - On New Year ' s Eve , about an hour before take-off for home , the Quinn family of Hudson stopped at one of Kenya ' s finest hotels for the last meal of their vacation . It was nearly the last meal of their lives . A bomb went off on the second floor above the dining room , injuring 85 persons and killing 19 , three of them Quinn friends who were sitting at their table . Pat Quinn , a zoologist at Benson ' s Wild Animal Farm who had taken his family on a vacation , his wife Donna , daughter Julie , 16 , and son Noah , 11 , were all injured when the explosion ripped through the fashionable Hotel Norfolk in Nairobi . The bomb was believed to have been planted by Palestinian terrorists . The Quinns had planned to be home on New Year ' s Day from their vacation trip . But they won ' t be returning to their home on Kimball Hill road now for at least another three weeks . All four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table were killed . They were Peggy Bartell , a Californian , Ian Ross , an Englishman , and Dutch citizen Annette Kanpinea . For Julie Quinn , a quiet dinner suddenly became " madness everywhere . " " It was 8:45 , " she told The Globe in a telephone interview . " We were just sitting down for dinner . Our bags were packed , and we expected to be at Nairobi Airport , which was close by , in time to take a 9:30 night flight out . We never made that flight . " All four Quinns are presently undergoing treatment in Nairobi Hospital . Pat Quinn , who suffered facial burns and an arm injury , had just come out of surgery when The Globe contacted the hospital . His wife , who suffered facial injuries , was confined to her bed , and unable to speak on the phone . Young Noah has a leg injury . Julie suffered facial and body injuries .

She alwayswent on my father ' s safari trips . She was going home too . The police out here think that bomb was supposed to go off exactly at midnight . They think it must have somehow been set off accidentally . " It was as though a balloon had popped in front of my face . That ' s the only way I can describe it . The balloon popped , and everything around us came tumbling down . I remember the walls , the ceiling , the tables , chairs , everything seemed to fall apart . " I was buried under a pile of wood . There were beams on me . One on my right leg kept me pinned there . I screamed for daddy . I couldn ' t see him in the darkness , but I heard him shout back . He wanted to know if I was all right . I heard Noah too . He was screaming . I didn ' t hear my stepmother . She was out there in the darkness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t hear her . There was so much shouting and screaming going on . " But the most terrifying part was when she got free and couldn ' t find her family and didn ' t know whether they were safe or not . Later on , Julie would learn her father had also been pinned under some heavy beams . His body was on an exposed electric wire , and every time water was poured on small fires that broke out near him , he received a jolt of electricity . Rescue crews pulled Quinn , his wife and Noah to safety . " A man came up to me with a flashlight , " said Julie about her own rescue . " He spotted the beam and tried to get it off my leg . He tried and tried , but couldn ' t budge it . Finally he gave up and went to help some woman who was screaming nearby . " I remember looking off to the side and seeing the fire there . It kept moving in closer to me . I wanted to be calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ' s what I did . I screamed as loud as I could . A man came out of nowhere . I don ' t know where he got the strength , but somehow he lifted that beam off of me , and I was free . " As I came out into the light , I could see a piece of wood sticking into my chest . Not a splinter . There was a piece of wood stuck in my body . My skin was all burned . I looked for my father . I didn ' t seem him . I couldn ' t find Noah or my stepmother either . I was all alone . " They put me on a stretcher , and they took me in an ambulance to a hospital in the town of Kenyappa . My family wasn ' t there . I kept asking for them . Nobody knew where they were . After they gave me emergency treatment , they gave me something to calm me down , but I couldn ' t go to sleep . I remember midnight arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin 1981 . " Then somebody came into the room and told me my family was at Nairobi Hospital . They were all alive . You ' ll never know how that news made me feel . " Julie expects to be released from Nairobi Hospital , where she was transferred two days later , sometime this week . Her brother may be released in a couple of weeks . It will be at least three weeks before Pat and Donna Quinn are able to return home . " It was a vacation trip . We had planned it all year . We left for Kenya on Dec. 15 , " Julie said . " What a beautiful country . What a wonderful time we all had . Then to sit down to dinner and have something like this happen . It ' s incredible .
