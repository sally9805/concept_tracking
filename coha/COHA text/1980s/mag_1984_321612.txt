Like everyone else in West Beirut last week , TIME staffers were engulfed by battle . As violence spread through the city , Middle East Bureau Chief William Stewart , Correspondent John Borrell and Reporter Abu Said Abu Rish found themselves caught in the crossfire . Their experiences : <P> As soon as fighting broke out in the streets of West Beirut , the Lebanese government ordered the army to shoot on sight . Steel shutters rang down on storefronts . Pedestrians scattered . Car horns blared incessantly . We were interviewing a former government minister when the fighting broke out , and emerged from his office to find shots ringing out amid the cafs and boutiques of Hamra Street , one of West Beirut 's busiest thoroughfares . We stopped briefly to buy provisions , then hurried to our apartment building . Not a minute too soon . The half a dozen men of the Lebanese Army contingent billeted in our lobby to protect diplomatic residents were already nervously fingering their M16s . Upstairs , we hastily improvised a late lunch . Suddenly an explosion shook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safest place in the apartment : a 6-ft. - long bathroom , away from any windows . As we huddled there , the clatter of M-16s and Kalashnikovs echoed off the walls of neighboring buildings . Now and then we would crawl on all fours to a window . Below us , the faint shadows of militiamen moved in the gathering darkness . Perhaps a mile out to sea , a U.S. Navy ship cruised past , a gray wolf on a gray sea beneath a hazy gray sky . <P> About two hours later we decided to seize the opportunity to move to the relative safety of TIME 'S office , located beneath the street level in an adjacent building . As we made our way down the stairs in the darkness , we found that the army billet in our lobby had suffered a direct hit . The ceiling had collapsed . The doors of our mailboxes had been ripped off their hinges . Not a window on the ground floor remained intact . We hastened to the TIME office 50 yds. away . As the night wore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; shells rocked the building . The tinkling of broken glass could be heard in the street above . Rockets roared overhead . Waiting for the next blast was almost as unnerving as the explosions . <P> By mid-afternoon on Tuesday the fighting had subsided , and on Wednesday morning we drove across town . A carpet hung limply from a gaping hole in a highrise . The thick steel cable of an elevator shaft dangled crazily out of a police station . No armed men were in evidence , sandbagged army checkpoints had been abandoned , and traffic flowed freely for the first time in weeks . But clearly the conflict was far from over . Militiamen had thrown up barricades around the district of Maasra , while fighting still raged along the green line that separates Christian East Beirut from the predominantly Muslim western half of the city . <P> That night we moved to a Druze-run hotel at some distance from the area of the most concentrated fighting . But we could not escape the sound of warfare . As we reached the seaside hotel , the U.S.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the city . Huge flashes of fire were followed by clouds of orange smoke . With each blast , the light fittings trembled , the windows rattled , and our hearts , for a second , stopped beating .
