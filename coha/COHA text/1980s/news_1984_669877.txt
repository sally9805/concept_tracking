When Daniel C. Johnson was growing up , he protested against the Vietnam War . Now he ' s a 29-year-old doctor in Oakland , Calif. , and he protests against U.S. Central American policy . Dr. Johnson ' s political conscience has stayed constant , but his life has changed : Now he has money to invest . So he tries to keep his investments consistent with his politics . For instance , he won ' t invest in military-equipment companies . " I don ' t want my money funding the current military policy of our country , " he says . Some people call this socially responsible investing ; others say it ' s just another name for left-wing investing and call it financially irresponsible . Whatever it ' s called , it ' s spreading . Several mutual funds , money market funds and newsletters catering to politically active clients have sprung up in the past two years . Traditional investment firms deride the investments as impractical money losers , but proponents predict that a good track record will eventually make this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social investing will be good investing , " says Wayne Silby , chairman of Calvert Group of Washington , D.C. " It won ' t be considered different . " Trying to exert political influence on corporations isn ' t a new idea . In the 1970s some shareholders used their votes as political tools . So-called socially responsible mutual funds aren ' t new , either . A fund that abstained from alcohol and tobacco stocks was started in 1937 by Putnam Management Co . In the 1960s , individual brokers began offering to " screen " investments politically , and in the early 1970s , two social investment funds , Pax World Fund Inc. and Dreyfus Third Century Fund , were started . But most of the growth has taken place since 1982 . Many of the children of the 1960s have money now , and they still worry about issues like nuclear weapons and U.S. business in South Africa . And a generally bullish stock market has given investors more confidence to play around with their funds . Within the past two years , a few new funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by Calvert Group and a money market fund run by Working Assets Management Co. of San Francisco , have been started . Two others are in the planning stage . Much of the social investing is done by individuals who are young , politically active professionals . Another common characteristic is inherited wealth . They are people who feel " my money is not something I ' m detached from , it ' s an integral part of my personality , " says Ronald W. Cavill , a Washington , D.C. , broker . " It ' s an identity thing  --  almost like monogrammed shirts . " Several activist organizations  --  including the San Francisco chapters of the Sierra Club , the Gray Panthers and the National Association of Credit Union Presidents  --  also invest in socially responsible mutual funds . Investors concede that their money isn ' t going to change the world . " We ' re not about to bring IBM ( shunned for its South African connections ) to its knees , " says a San Francisco community activist who inherited money . But " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The closest analogy is to a vote . It ' s important to do your bit . " In addition to companies that make weapons , do business in South Africa or produce nuclear energy , the funds stay away from companies that have bad records in equal employment for women and minorities and environmental and product safety . What the funds look for are companies with social consciences like theirs . Three " good " companies that crop up on some lists : Quaker Oats Co. , which makes low-sugar cereals , Dayton Hudson Corp. , which uses 5% of its federally taxable income for charitable purposes , and Magma Power Co. , a leader in the development of geothermal energy . The financial record of socially responsible funds has been mixed . In 1983 , the three general " social investing " mutual funds  --  Calvert , Dreyfus and Pax World  --  all earned a positive return . Pax World Fund even did a little better than the Standard &; Poor ' s 500 stock index , which rose 22. 6% but Calvert ' s funds earned only an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . Of the funds that exist now , only Dreyfus Third Century , which has the least stringent social criteria , has more than $100 million in assets . The others range between $10 million and $40 million . And last year , Shearson Lehman/American Express was unable to raise the $75 million it needed to start a socially responsible mutual fund . The funds look for new investors in magazines like the Progressive , the Nation , Mother Jones and Nuclear Times . One fund ' s ads picture nuclear cooling towers with the warning . " It ' s 11 p. m . Do you know where your money is ? " Another shows a castle made of money floating in the air with the caption , " Here ' s to a very romantic idea . A lot of people think ideas and finances can ' t mix . Yes they can . " Increased interest in social investing has recently spawned two newsletters , Insight and Good Money , which , among other things , track the performance of " acceptable companies . " And earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investors Guide , which examines the records of the 1 , 400 companies on the New York Stock Exchange in areas like labor practices and product safety . Two other concerns , Addison-Wessley Publishing Co. and Bantam Books Inc. , plan to put out how-to investment manuals in the next year . Some mainstream financial institutions are also beginning to accommodate investors ' social consciences . Since 1981 , Prudential Insurance Co. has attracted 20 pension-fund clients with the chance to invest in all-unionized construction projects . Favia , Hill &; Associates Inc. , the institutional investment management affiliate of Chemical Bank , is courting money-management clients with the suggestion that they can earn competitive returns with a " South Africa-free " portfolio . But most traditional mutual fund companies are still skeptical . " Our judgment is it ' s a fringe product and will stay that way , " says Arnold D. Scott , executive vice president and general counsel of Massachusetts Financial Services Co . Ronald P. Lynch , a managing partner of Lord , Abbett Co. , argues that brokers should concentrate on " making a profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcuffs on that . " Some proponents insist they can prosper not in spite of social screening , but because of it . " Corporate responsibility is important as an indication of enlightened and progressive management , " says Jerome L. Dodson , who founded Working Assets and is starting a mutual fund called Renaissance Fund . But for many customers , the return isn ' t so important . As Jamie Cope , a Newton , Mass. , photographer and investor , says , " If I put my money into something that made bullets and I was driving a Mercedes because of that investment , I couldn ' t enjoy it . . . . I ' d rather gain slowly and feel good about it .
