txt RATIONALITY scientific belief . At the very least , it was suggested , science is an instrumental modality , its idea is to manipulate the world , whereas religion is about higher things . I remain unconvinced . And a vigorous debate with J. H. M. Beattie over our magic paper shows ( Beattie 1964 , 1966 ; Jarvie and Agassi 1967 ; Beattie 1970 ; Jarvie and Agassi 1973 ) that the other side , particularly the symbolists , such as Needham , Beattie and Leach , are quite unconvinced too . And what is done , in cargo cults as in Ghost Dances and in other comparable social change rituals , is to enact , through a variety of symbolic performances , a kind of ritual drama . Essentially , cargo cults provide something to do , not just something to think , although of course they do that too . They do not seem to me to be primarily , as Jarvie suggests , types of explanatory theory ; rather they are recourses , in times of stress , to the consolations of rite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolations of make-believe . ( Beattie 1966 , p. 71 ) Why downplay cargo cults as something to think ? Because belief does not explain action , they maintain , and to say that it does is to commit the fallacy of intellectualism . Christians in general may believe the same things yet act very differently ; magicians may act much the same yet have idiosyncratically different beliefs . Intellectualism is such a dirty word in anthropology , the caricature of it as the if-I-were-a horse argument so ingrained , 18 that it is very hard to get over the idea that anti-intellectualism rests on a grasp of science and of thinking that needs to be rectified in order for rehabilitated intellectualism to be confronted . There is no rational thinking as such ; there is simply problem-solving as best as we can , which is a sub-category of goal-directed or rational action . 1.10 Further problems with cognitive interpretations Another reason why cognitive systems raise especially acute problems for the doctrine of the rational unity of mankind is because those systems may include denials of it . They may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the necessity to avoid and to eliminate contradictions in our ideas ; they may claim that the only true knowledge is religious or mystical enlightenment and further claim that that is already given to us in dogma or present only to those who open themselves to the experience ; they may even explicitly divide the world into rational and civilized men and irrational and uncivilized savages , as the Ancient Greeks // did . Obviously , then , the diversity of cognitive systems is a grave problem for the rational unity of mankind . My own view is that mankind 's capacity to act rationally , to pursue goals , to learn from experience , is unique to this particular species of animal and that science is the paradigm case of rationality as learning from experience . It is therefore important to overcome the difficulties I have outlined . This can be done , while allowing degrees of rationality to alternative cognitive systems and allowing full rationality to actions based upon those cognitive systems . Thinking , believing and acting are all , I have been arguing , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of goal-directed or aim-orientated action . I have already set aside the endlessly heard objection that there is more to magic and religion than their cognitive content ( emotions ; symbolism ) ; or even that if there is any cognitive content ( which some would deny ) it is sociologically insignificant . This may be true and for the sake of my argument I shall grant it , even though I myself think cognitive content is here of paramount importance . All I need for my argument is agreement that there does appear to be some putative cognitive content in the thoughtsystems we call magic and religion . Let me also set aside the worry that the three categories , magic , religion and science , are not distinct and hence should not be treated as though they were . As a disciple of Tylor and Frazer , who saw an evolutionary connection between them , I can hardly operate with some hard-and-fast distinction . Not being an evolutionist , I can go even further and say I believe there are elements of the other two in each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in science , both content and practice ; and the same goes for magic and for religion . The labels are simply analytical distinctions best employed in the manner suggested by Frazer . This rough and ready distinction turns on whether the causal agents thought to be at work are manipulable animated natural forces , in which case we call it magic ' ; personalized supernatural forces , in which case we call it religion ' ; or impersonal , inanimate natural forces , in which case we call it science ' . Where there is a mix or an overlap the label we choose will depend on the purpose at hand  --  hence such coinages as magico-religious ' systems of thought . 1.11 Views of science Much of the strength of my discussion draws upon a non-traditional notion of science . Deriving mainly from Popper , but reflecting also the impact of Agassi and Gellner , I offer a quite // broad picture of science , one in which it merges back imperceptibly into myth and story . On the methodological level I follow Popper in identifying science with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging it with theories , myths , ideas , conjectures and guesses , and by responding to difficulties in doing this by viewing them as learning experiences . Hence empiricism , inductivism , indeed all claims to a special method above and beyond that involving an attitude of learning and a procedure of trial and error , I consider too narrowing a picture of science . But in holding up science as an embodiment of the strongest idea of rationality ( rationality2 ) , one has to take into account the historical context that colours the reactions of most of one 's readers . For traditionally the rationality of science has been identified with far more precise methods and procedures than the truisms of trial and error , and as specifically hostile to all sorts of things ( such as myth and story ) my view is not in the least hostile to . For example many humanists of the present generation identify science with cold and anti-life objectivity ( cf. the Lawrence v. Russell debate mentioned earlier ) , with a false detachment of subject from object ( phenomenology ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mystery ( mystics ) ; with positivism ( whatever that now can mean ) ; and so on . I want not to be saddled with any of these attributions , although I can not expend space endlessly explaining what I do not mean or intend or imply . I know that whatever I say I am going to be read as committing myself to all those things . So be it . The key matter here is to set aside the specific historical identifications of science with certain kinds of models of rationality . One of the oldest was the identification of science with Euclidean geometry , namely an ordered and systematic set of deductions from explicit premisses . Even today there are philosophers of science ( not so many scientists ) who think a subject has n't finally become scientific until it is set out in a modern version of Euclid 's formal system : with axioms , theorems , lemmas , derivations , etc . This picture of the rationality of science I find too strong and specific not because it rules out magic and religion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to too much good science . There is the historical fact that science is a living tradition , a set of customs , social institutions and personnel , sets of books , papers , documents and apparatus , and a great many errors , side-tracks , complete nonsense . This is real science and this is also rational science , not some imaginary Euclidean formal system . If science is the search to find out what is written in the Book of Nature there is no good reason to think that it is written in a formal language system . // Science is also sometimes identified with the method of induction from experience , with slow and tentative advance up the ladder of inductive generalization , starting from indubitable facts and reaching indubitable axioms of experience . This too is an excessively strong and exclusionary view of rationality . Once again , my picture of science stumbling and fumbling , starting at all sorts of weird places ( e.g. sun worship ) , setting out to legitimate prejudices , to upset the establishment , gain the Nobel Prize , proceeding intuitively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideas at once in a rush , taking a lifetime looking for an idea and failing ( Einstein and Unified Field Theory ) , and there being nothing at all resembling hard and fast facts to start all this from will not fit the inductivist strait-jacket . Our present knowledge , as we laughingly call it , is an unsystematic and probably quite unreliable chaos . It is , however , all we have and we begin from there and scramble towards where we want to get using whatever footholds and handholds we can reach , and taking the falls that result . Furthermore , as in climbing , what looks like the way to a peak may lead down , what looks like a peak may be only a ridge , one may climb to the top only to spot a higher point further on . Indeed my picture of science is such that it can not be identified with any too specific a system or procedure , since it is a social institution . Efforts to attribute a system or procedure to it are efforts to reform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its capacity to learn from its own experience . The success of such efforts is quite moot . No one , including Popper , believes there awaits us an algorithm for the successful acquisition of knowledge , for the successful solution of problems . Hence the standing of methodological rules is problematic . Only by stressing that learning is mainly learning from mistakes do they make sense . We may devise some negative procedural rules that fence off obvious pitfalls , but these rules can not otherwise show us the way to go . The picture of science I offer , then , need be no stronger than this . We can learn to avoid some mistakes . This is a weak sense of progress . It gives us at best a little more power over ourselves and nature . We try to be orderly and systematic because it has the negative value of being a way of searching for mistakes , gaps , inconsistencies . Science does presuppose there is an external world that is in some sort of determinate state , i.e. in some sort of state such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be mistaken  --  not to mention irrelevant , foolish , metaphorical , etc . This is an image of science that somewhat transcends its embodiments in actual scientists and actual social institutions . It is norm- // ative and descriptive , because it is at the heart of science that it strives to better its content and its procedures . Hence it is descriptively constituted by its own norms . It is an image of science that lends some objectivity to our thinking , to our cognitive efforts . But it is an extremely liberal  --  I should say radical  --  view of the scientific enterprise . It is a picture of science that does not exclude magic , does not exclude religion and does not exclude emotion , feeling , superstition , darkness , the aesthetic , and so on . But it is a picture that denies the attempt to characterize primitive man as without science and also denies the picture of primitive man as somehow thinking in a manner that is totally different , more primitive or whatever and that in order to do science and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rationality as rational thinking Now that it is clear that I want rationality to be taken socially , as a characteristic of social systems , namely as a classification of the arrangements for learning from experience , I am in a position to tackle directly the alternative  --  rationality as mental act rather than social act . Two clearly related mental acts are involved : thought and belief . Thought is a process , belief an outcome . The two are connected . The outcome of some thought processes is the establishment of beliefs . Some would say rational = belief arrived at by rational thought processes ( such as induction from experience ) ; others would say thinking rationally about a topic means having rational beliefs about it ( involving only observables , e.g. ) . But we need not accept these stipulations . Let us explore them separately . This matter of rational thinking . Western culture is permeated with the idea that there is a split in the nature of man between thinking and feeling , reason and emotion , the rational and the irrational ; the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , warm , impulsive , involved and unreasonable . Life is sometimes depicted as a struggle between these two sides : emotion causes you to fall in love , but reason should decide whether to marry . Emotions lead us to war , reason is required to make peace . Perhaps our follies come from emotion , our successes from reason . Perhaps . Romantics and the followers of blood and soil ' think otherwise . Rationalists always felt that the danger was , as Hume put it , that reason is and always will be the slave of the passions . In late nineteenth-century evolutionist anthropology this split emerges in the view of human history as the evolutionary triumph of reason , or rational thinking , which has led to enlightenment , science , industry , progress and High Victorianism ( I apologize RATIONALITY for the irony ) over the dark forces of ignorance , superstition , contagion , association , emotion , mysticism and primitive fear . Primitive societies were those dominated by magic , taboo and even religion and hence prone to those sentiments . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be built on and their contact with civilization ' which would do the building necessary to bring them up into the light . Enlightenment was science , industrial technology and the Church of England . Passion , then , is dark and primitive ; where life is governed by these forces of primitive mentality , we get primitive culture . What was this non-rational thinking like ? Two main views of in what primitive thinking consisted contended . Levy-Bruhl thought that it was pre-logical '  --  logic was the measure of rationality . Tylor and Frazer thought science was the measure of rationality and for them = empiricism and induction . Hence while Levy-Bruhl saw a shift of balance from the complete dominance of mystical thinking in primitive society to its subordination to logical thinking in modern society , even though mystical thinking would always be with us , Tylor and Frazer saw empiricism and its product science as a progressive force that would vanquish the forces of unreason altogether . They drew the subtle consequence that magic was less irrational than religion because it was more empirical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rational , i.e. non-emotional , side is matched in popularity by the model that there are different kinds of thinking and that science stems from one kind only . The modern exponent of this view is Lucien Levy-Bruhl in his Les Fonctions mentales dans les societes inferieurs of 1910 . Levy-Bruhl demarcates primitive thinking from logical or modern thinking and he places these on a time scale : primitive thinking is earlier , logical thinking later . He does not hold that logical thinking extirpates primitive thinking , merely that it becomes dominant.19 How we think , according to Levy-Bruhl , has to do with how we participate in society . Primitive society is small-scale , undifferentiated , and each person plays many roles : familial , political , judicial , religious , economic . In primitive society people participate in the whole , in their thinking as well as their doing ; that thinking is mystical and prelogical : participatory . Mystical thinking resorts to explanation involving forces , influences and actions that are imperceptible ( p. 33 ) . Pre-logical thinking is that which does not bind itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead it is unspecific about what connections can be made , things are what they are and something else as well . The dictum deduced from Hume 's argument , that " anything may // produce anything , " might have served as a motto for primitive mentality ' ( 338 ) . As the social group grows and differentiates , as the division of labour spreads , the holistic participation is spoiled , allowing logical thinking , objective classification and perception to emerge . Levy-Bruhl is a thinker who has been much misunderstood , caricatured , even vilified . The problems of interpreting him are compounded by his own shifts of view and qualification within a rather large corpus of writings . His stoutest defender was EvansPritchard who in his 1934 article and in his posthumous 1981 history of the field , commends Levy-Bruhl 's work for its thoughtprovoking quality . And indeed we can see the sources of his own epoch-making ideas of 1937 already present : savages are prevented from pursuing enquiries into the workings of nature by their collective representations . These formalised patterns of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or motor , activities which conflict with them . ( 1934 , p. 41 ) After correcting us about Levy-Bruhl on the savage dislike of discursive thought : It is due neither to incapacity nor inaptitude , since those who have drawn our attention to this feature of primitive mentality expressly state that among them are minds quite as capable of scientific thought as those of Europeans ' .. . Neither is it the result of profound intellectual torpor , of enervation . . . for these same natives . . . show themselves ... observant , wise , skilful , clever , even subtle , when an object interests them . ( Levy-Bruhl 1922 , pp. 29  --  30 ) the question arises of what Evans-Pritchard thinks Levy-Bruhl does mean : If the mystical thought of a savage is socially determined so also is the scientific thought of a civilized person . Therefore , any evaluation between the savage 's capacity for logical thinking ' and the civilized man 's capacity for logical thinking ' is irrelevant to the question at issue which is whether patterns of thought are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies . . . are both thinking in patterns of thought provided for us by the societies in which we live . ( Evans-Pritchard 1934 , pp. 48  --  9 ) There is no mystical thinking ' , there are ' collective representations , i.e. social models . When a man is killed by a spear-thrust the savage works vengeance with magic , directed against the // other 's magic and its perpetrator ( We after all , blame he who spears , not the spear . ) Everyone can think , says Evans-Pritchard , but not everyone 's thinking obeys the canons of logic and scientific method . This is what is missing . He seems to want to detach the psychologism , to talk not of people 's thinking , but of the social institutions of logic and scientific method , so yielding a distinction , a non-invidious and valid distinction , much like the way we distinguish between acephalous and other societies , between matrilineal and patrilineal societies , between those with totems and those without . Returning to Levy-Bruhl thirty years later , Evans-Pritchard was more inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Levy-Bruhl could have posed the problem to better advantage . It is not so much a question of primitive versus civilized mentality as the relation of two types of thought to each other in any society . . . a problem of levels of thought and experience . . . Had he not been so positivistic . . . he might have asked himself . . . what are the functions of the two kinds of thought in any society . . . the kinds associated with what are sometimes distinguished as the expressive ' and the instrumental ' . ( 1965 , pp. 91  --  2 ) How very different were the views of the English School of Tylor and Frazer on the same issues . For them rationality was to be equated not with logic but with empiricism , and empiricism was equated with science . French logic led to failed Cartesian physics , English empiricism led to Newton . Magic , Tylor and Frazer noted , engaged in prediction and experimentation . Its failures led its followers to mysticism and religion , and the failure of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence science . Although this view of magic is resisted in some quarters , I will quote a field anthropologist : Behind this ritual idiom there stands a most rigid and neverquestioned dogma , learnt by every child in infancy and forced home by countless instances of everyday usage based upon it and meaningless without it or in its despite . This dogma , in general , is that effects are secured by incantation and that without incantation such effects can not come to pass . . . In brief , there is no natural theory of yam growth , of the powers of canoe lashings , of fish nets , of gift exchange in strange places overseas , of disease and death , of wind and rain , of love between man and woman . All these things can not possibly exist in their own right . All are supernaturally created // by the ritual incantation with the help of the appropriate technological processes in agriculture , canoe-making , fishing preparation and with the help of more mundane wooing in overseas gift-exchange and in love-making , but without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death or in their counteracting ( apart only from the practice of bleeding the patient in some cases of illness ) . This latter type of unaided incantation expresses truly the attitude of the native towards incantation throughout . It is the really important factor in producing an effect . ( Fortune 1932 , pp. 97  --  8 ) Philosophers , of all people , are responsible for discovering the decisive arguments that refute both identifications  --  that of rational thought with the logical and that of rational thought with the empirical . Sir Francis Bacon formulated the argument about logic in the early seventeenth century . He pointed to the wellknown fact that what any valid syllogism does is simply re-arrange the pattern of the terms , it does not add anything new . There is nothing in the conclusion that is not already contained in the premisses.20 But the rational endeavour of science is to get new knowledge , so logic can not be the basis of its rationality . In the late nineteenth century two logicians especially , Husserl and Frege , added the point that logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes at all , but the study of correct ( objective ) patterns of argument and hence is no more about mentality than is mathematics , which is the ( objective ) study of the necessary properties of different worlds . Some have concluded from this that logic has nothing to do with rationality , or that science is not rational . I hardly think this is warranted . The correct conclusion is that whatever rational thinking is , it is not a psychological state . But it would , for example , not be rational to violate the law of contradiction  --  I think it is easy to show that that would be inimical to learning from experience . As to the argument identifying rational thought with science , with empiricism and induction , David Hume , a great rationalist , found two great difficulties here . The first is that science is the knowledge of causes , whereas empiricism is a doctrine of what can be experienced through the senses ; the second is , how do we get from facts to causes ? Hume says you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , define cause as simply one observable event being constantly followed by ( ' conjoined with ' ) another . But then , he says , how can we know of it ? No matter how many times we have seen it , next time things could be different . No , you reply , because the course of nature does not // change . How do we know that , he answers , only because you have always seen that it is so . Next time it could be different , because you can never see anything that will make it necessarily so . To those who simply abandon a science of causes Hume would have answered that science was knowledge of causes because a causeless universe does not obey the principle of sufficient reason ( things are the way they are for a reason and change only for a reason ) . Such a universe is not rational and can not support an ordered science . The breakdown of the attempts to link rational thought to logic or to empiricism may have been discovered by philosophers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialists . The two arguments feed a despair of reason and provide excuses for three characteristic irrationalist and anti-rationalist reactions : they are dogmatism , scepticism and mysticism . All three are used as stepping stones to the relativism we shall discuss in Part Two . Dogmatism is the continued re-iteration of a failed idea as though repeated saying makes it so . Even today we can hear assertions to the effect that attention to the facts , or to the senses , or to logic is the measure of rational thought . Residual positivism is often in the background . Dogmatism on such issues is , however , the antithesis of rational thought . Scepticism is despair not of this or that idea , but of the hope itself that human thought can find answers . Hume himself is classified as a sceptic because at certain points he seems to think that balanced arguments can be found on both sides of most points ( such as whether rational thought leads to science ) and hence that decisions have to be handed over to common sense , tradition or inclination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mystic believes in truth or enlightenment but does not think rational methods , whether logical , empirical or other , are the path to follow . Instead some combination of faith and practice will do it , but only for each individual singly . No general articulable knowledge results . In so far as the search for rationality is a search for the principle unifying mankind , the collapse of that version that explicates rationality as rational thought is a blow to that project . The three irrational reactions , dogmatism , scepticism and mysticism , can be used to argue that mankind is unified only in its diversity and that no principle exists to explain and sort out that diversity . This is one formulation of relativism which I shall try to show is not compatible with the doctrine of the unity of mankind . // 1.13 Rationality as rational belief Now to rational belief . Or rather the identification of human rationality , the unifying principle of humanity , with the holding of rational beliefs . What would rational belief be ? A rational doctrine ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational doctrine ? Science ? That 's rather broad . Axiomatized thermodynamics ? That 's rather narrow . Euclid 's Elements ? Only science and mathematics ? The thirty-nine articles of the Church of England ? Astrology ? How do we discriminate among such candidates ? Again : what is rational belief in a given doctrine  --  believing the right things for the right reasons ? What would such reasons be like ? The demarcation of rational beliefs and the identification of the right reasons coincide in the philosophy of empiricism : the right beliefs are those based on observation ( your own or trusted others ' ) , observation is the right reason for believing them . The paradigm of this observationalist empiricism is science . All it commands any human being to do is Open your eyes and see ' . The great attraction of empiricism is its common sense , its simplicity , its optimism ( problems will be solved by opening our eyes ) , and its egalitarianism  --  all of us can observe , all of us can be rational and orderly in our thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a pity we have to muddy the picture . But , as we have seen , empiricism breaks down , induction breaks down , realism itself if taken too naively breaks down because clearly science and mathematics sometimes dabble in things that are anything but real , e.g. non-Euclidean geometry . To recap . Rational belief means there are certain doctrines or ideas that are themselves the touchstones of a person 's rationality . This has in the past been held of religion . Nowadays it is more commonly held of common sense , or of Marxism or of science . Whatever the candidate the problem is the same : beliefs change and doctrines change . What is a rational belief at one time can have one burned at the stake , sent to the Gulag Archipelago , or ridiculed at another time . Such a realization can lead to the same sort of breakdown and despair as we found with rational thought . The three characteristic reactions of dogmatically affirming some beliefs as rational , sceptically concluding that none are , or mystically holding that they surpass understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ideas against current science and find them rationally wanting . Others maintain that what is rational belief for us is not for cargo cultists . And Edward Rice ( 1974 ) has implied that he is prepared to grant that it is rational for cultists on Tanna // to maintain that they have made spirit journeys and communed with the spirit of the dead prophet John Frum even if such mysteries are closed to the white man . Westerners must try to accept Cargo on its own terms , not theirs , for Cargo is a reality , even though their westernconditioned minds tell them it is impossible . . . ( Rice 1974 , p. xv ) . Such despair of reason is excessive but entirely characteristic . It results from excessive expectations . Whence these expectations ? Well , the discovery , in Ancient Greece , of what we call mathematics and its exemplary character as an achievement of reason led to the question of , if in mathematics , why not elsewhere ? When modern science appears on the scene , employing mathematics and achieving spectacular success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science as rational ( even the irrationalists agree ) , mysticism and superstition as irrational . Where do we draw the line of demarcation ? Here we can turn to Popper 's demarcation based on attitude to error : the difference lies in the attitude of learning from it . In Bartley 's ( 1968 ) formulation the stress is even more on sociological features , because he is concerned to show that some systems of ideas have built-in evasion strategies to avoid learning from experience , and these are the pillars of intellectual irrationalism , sharply to be demarcated from open-minded learning systems . So we get the answer that rational belief is belief held in an open-minded , critical manner : no set of ideas is rational , rationality inheres rather in the manner in which they are held . Rationality is , then , different from truth . True beliefs are not the same as rational beliefs . It is entirely possible to entertain in an irrational manner statements that are true , namely by adopting a dogmatic or otherwise uncritical stance towards them . It is entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false , namely by adopting a critical attitude towards them . 1.14 Science as the supreme embodiment of rationality In Evans-Pritchard ( 1937 ) , we can find the suggestion to identify rationality neither with logic ( although that is part of it ) nor with empiricism ( although that is part too ) but with features of the social and cognitive systems to which we belong . A system subject to self-conscious review , both as a system and as to its adequacy , // hence to criticism and to change , is more rational than one without these features . This is argued apropos the closed and defensive thought system of the Azande . A most remarkably prescient book . The book outlines a weird and fascinating culture permeated by witchcraft ( bad ) and magic ( good ) and sorcery ( both ) . It shows how it all fits neatly together as Evans-Pritchard even tested the oracle for some of his own decisions and it worked quite well . I never found great difficulty in observing oracle consultations . I found that in such matters the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Azande and to take oracular verdicts as seriously as they take them . I always kept a supply of poison for the use of my household and neighbours and we regulated our affairs in accordance with the oracles ' decisions . I may remark that I found this as satisfactory a way of running my home and affairs as any other I know of . ( 1937 , pp. 269  --  70 ) For every failure there are excuses . We can derive inspiration from Evans-Pritchard for a characterization of what it is about our social system that makes it host to science . We can suggest its rationality has to do with criticism and change . Parts of our social/cognitive system are as it were open to change and development ; they do not , as Gellner stresses , collapse when some key cognitive component is replaced . The system flexibly incorporates and adapts to change of ideas , rather than resorting to ad hoc defences , still less to mystical , dogmatic or sceptical despair . As Evans-Pritchard says , in a closed system the web of belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the texture of his thought and he can not think that his thought is wrong ' ( Evans-Pritchard 1937 , p. 195 ) . If EvansPritchard is right here , the very difficult problem is how do savage societies ever learn , ever make the transition to open and changing ones ? How did it happen historically , how does it happen now ? How is what Gellner calls the Big Ditch between the savage and the modern mind crossed ? Those who would say the savage never enters into the modern thought-system have to say we or our predecessors were never savages . If the transition ever happens , and I suppose it must have , doubtless it is a partial , piecemeal , haphazard process . One explanation of it ever happening might be that a teacher somewhere once challenged his students to criticize and improve on his ideas . Why would he do that ? Was he a saint ? Perhaps it was culture clash , his familiarity with alternative ideas , perhaps awareness that other peoples acted and believed differently with apparent reason ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azande magic that led Evans-Pritchard to assert that it was as rational a way to conduct everyday affairs as any other . Not as much as science , perhaps , but then we do n't employ science to govern all our everyday affairs . Perhaps it was just a reckless challenge that was surprisingly fruitful and stimulating . Thus is acquired or invented the social embodiment of open-mindedness . Thought process and actual beliefs are no mark of rationality . So rational thinking is problem- or goal-orientated thinking and results in rational beliefs only if they are held open to criticism ; and rational action is simply a model that embraces both . Science is a paradigm of rationality not because of its ideas , not because it is true ; not because it is the result of special kinds of social institutions that foster if they do not impose the critical and openminded attitude of wanting to learn from experience . These institutions include language , traditions of argument , libraries , universities , journals , seminars , laboratories , conferences , and so on . Despite all these institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can find there dogmatism , both personal and institutional ; mysticism , mainly personal ; thoughtcontrol , propaganda , careerism , corruption and so on . Yet , like democracy , a terrible system but the best we have , science remains the best approach to rationality we have . The forces of irrationality and corruption are strong and have constantly to be struggled against : all social institutions require constant surveillance , maintenance , repair and improvement . The rational unity of mankind , then , is less an article of belief and more a social programme ( based , no doubt , on moral conviction ) under which we attempt to construct a certain sort of community of men in which we face openly and unsparingly the necessity and value of learning from experience , articulating our problems and assessing our solutions and hoping that in the process we make some modest progress in alleviating the worst features of our environment and of our lives together . 63 He that will carefully peruse the history of mankind and look abroad into the several tribes of men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy himself , that there is scarce that principle of morality to be named , or rule of virtue to be thought on ( those only excepted that are absolutely necessary to hold society together , which commonly too are neglected betwixt distinct societies ) , which is not , somewhere or other , slighted and condemned by the general fashion of whole societies of men , governed by practical opinions and rules of living quite opposite to others . Locke , Essay , Book I , 3 , 10 2.1 Relativism , moral and cognitive The problem of relativism is the problem of sustaining the principle of the moral unity of mankind in the face of the vast diversity of man 's moral practices . The moral unity of mankind is the idea that all men are of equal moral worth  --  a sentiment that can be cashed out in a host of ways . It can mean men are entitled to equal moral treatment . It can mean men agree on their moral prescriptions and proscriptions . It can mean that the human race constitutes a single universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral principles . It can mean that the notion of morality is found everywhere . Whatever the interpretation , it is contentious . There is not universal agreement that all men are entitled to equal moral treatment . In one society or another we can find race , rank , standing , wealth , power , moral condition and degree of ritual purity all affecting moral treatment . As Locke noted in the motto , there is scarce a principle of morality or a rule of virtue that is not slighted and condemned by the practices of other societies . Savages were arguably part of the human race but it was long thought they had no morality and hence did not participate in the universe of discourse ( see the discussion of the Amerindians in 1.7 above ) . The most glaring and problematic contradiction , however , is found in opposition to the general formulation : many societies would concede that slaves , women and children are members of the human race , but would not concede their equal moral worth and hence entitlement to equal moral treatment . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only at the whim of , their owners . // Relativism seems to come about like this . Assume all men are of equal moral worth . This seems to imply that what they do is of equal moral worth : in thought and deed , in their judgments of value and of truth , their construction of intellectual , valuational , technical and social structures . Hence if one culture excoriates all others , words and deeds , as worthy only of destruction , dispersal and enslavement , there is no way , without violating the principle of equal moral worth , that such excoriation can be criticized . It looks as though cultures have to beg to differ . One culture believes other people are not human beings and so not of equal moral worth , another believes women and children are men 's property and property has no inherent moral worth or moral rights , still another believes that equal moral worth is achieved , not inherent , still another that it is ascribed to some , achieved by others but not by everyone , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth defeat these alternatives and establish their own ? It looks hopeless . But perhaps here is a chink in this seemingly headlong clash : examination of each unit , culture or society , for consistency . If we can detect inconsistencies in the articulated or implicit views of a culture , we may then argue that not all of what is being maintained can be maintained together . Then we may suggest evidential and consequentialist tests for sifting the views . Obviously , where views are not articulated or are embodied in practices , little can be done . The problem of rationality was to a certain extent a conceptual problem . A conceptual problem arises when a word  --  rationality  --  is employed by many different commonsense and philosophical theories and confusion can only be cleared up by criticizing those theories and settling on a theory that explains and permits these others to make sense . The problem of relativism is rather more of a theoretical and practical problem , less a problem of confusion needing clarification , more one of error and inconsistency needing to be corrected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great hopes of mankind is that there is a species unity of interests and hence of mutual regard , that will sooner or later win out over the forces of divisiveness , partiality , parochialism , and domination that currently set us apart from one another . But before I go any further with this , I must clear up something that may bother the tidy-minded reader . Relativism comes in several packages , the most general is cultural relativism ; this is conventionally divided into cognitive relativism and moral relativism . I have decided for purposes of symmetry in this book to treat of moral/cultural relativism in this part . Cognitive relativism strikes me as rather different from moral // relativism , although they are sometimes treated alike . Moral diversity stimulates moral relativism . However , the diversity of human cognitive efforts is not the sole buttress to cognitive relativism . There is as well an argument at a meta-level that goes to suggest that all cognition , in some way or other , is suspect . Let me illustrate with cargo cults once more . Cargo cults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and what we human beings can do to make things happen in it . These conjectures have great charm and beauty . Here are two of my favourites : A cargo prayer : O Father Consel , you are sorry for us . You can help us . We have nothing  --  no aircraft , no ships , no jeeps , nothing at all . The Europeans steal it from us . You will be sorry for us and send us something . ( Lawrence 1954 ) And an idea of how the cults catch up with current affairs : in 1964 . . . a tribe in New Hanover had refused to pay its taxes and , instead , had saved up all of its money to buy ' President Lyndon Johnson . By getting numbah-one man belong America ' into their camp , the natives of Kavieng and other villages in New Hanover were sure they would be able to get their hands on the white man 's goods . A native prophet predicted that the Queen Mary would arrive on June sixteenth , and would disgorge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian oppressors. ' . . . soon at least 2,500 of the island 's 7,000 or so natives were firm believers in the Messiah from the Pedernales . . . the handsome young prophet of the Johnson Cult . . . asked Healy an Australian official if he would do a favor for the people of the village . He handed over a heavy bag containing more than $1,000 in shilling pieces . The money , Bos Mailik explained , was what they had gathered to buy ' President Johnson . Would Healy handle the transaction for them ? ( Machlin 1970 , pp. 24  --  5 ) Some are rather vague , some are metaphysical and some are clear , precise and false . False ? Yes , just that . It is quite fair to say something like this . To the extent that the cults endeavour to reunite the living with their dead ancestors , so far as can be known nothing we can do will bring this goal nearer . Compare the dreadful story of eleven-year-old Wesley Parker of Barstow , California , a diabetic , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then threw out his insulin supply . Within two days the boy was seriously ill , but his father concluded , I knew then that the diabetes was caused by two demons and that we could // no longer give him insulin without inviting the demon back . ' The demons were commanded to leave the boy 's body , but he died anyway . The father refused burial because he was sure his son would be resurrected . At a prayer meeting the boy was commanded to rise from the dead , but he lay still in his casket . Even after the funeral the father maintained he had misinterpreted God 's word and that his son would rise from the dead four days after he was buried , as in the Biblical story of Lazarus ( UPI report in Honolulu Advertiser , August 1978 ) . To the extent that the cults endeavour to bring about concrete social changes such as increased wealth for Melanesians , an end to discrimination and exploitation , and entry into the modern world with all its benefits and shortcomings , they propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , ritual purification , demonstrations of faith are not going to accomplish these goals.2 Concentrating then on such accomplishable goals , I want to make the case that not all approaches are relativistically equal . The goals may be achieved , but not by means of cargo-cult activity . On the basis of a scientific picture of the world and a social scientific picture of how people can make things happen we can I think extend a hopeful alternative to the Melanesians . Cashcrops , industrialization , appropriate reorganization of society along bureaucratic-rational lines , these are a better recipe for achieving the goals . Making no judgment on the goals ( although I believe that can be done too , see Gellner 1973b , 1975 , 1980 , 1983 ) , I nevertheless bring the rationality discussed in Part Ito oppose the relativism to be discussed in Part II . Offering scientific rationality as an alternative to cargo cults would hardly seem sufficient to defeat relativism , but it is . For relativism has a weak and negative case . It gains all its plausibility not from any strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any ) , but from seemingly fatal weaknesses its proponents seek out in absolutism ( which is taken to be the alternative ) . If the alternative can be shown not to have those weaknesses , or to have weaknesses that are not fatal , then the main argumentative prop of relativism ( ' What 's the alternative ? ) is removed . It then becomes possible to counter-attack and show how vague , inconsistent and defenceless relativism is . We can counterpose science , understood as a set of social institutions embodying and guarding the tradition of critical discussion , with relativism , the doctrine that categorical judgments about such things as the falsity of cargo cults can not be made . When I wrote above that cargo cults were false what this means to relativists is that in the context of my cultural criteria of falseness cargo cults // are false . But in the context of cargo-cult cultural criteria of falseness they are not . And between my cultural criteria of falseness and cargo-cult cultural criteria of falseness there is no mediator.3 Cargo cults are a useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermining can be turned aside . First , like many religions , cargo cults do make factual assertions and concrete predictions . We can invite ourselves to assess these by the usual means . In the event that they are false : a mountain does not open up , a ship bearing cargo and the spirits of the dead does not arrive , PORT MORESBY , New Guinea  --  Pulling the magic corks from the mountain peak did n't produce the expected torrent of riches , but New Guinea 's cargo cultists keep hoping . They thought two concrete survey markers atop Mount Turu were placed there by government agents to bottle up the mountain 's wealth , so 4,000 chanting cultists dug up the markers last July . Nothing happened . Now they plan to erect a $20,000 monument in Canberra and invite Queen Elizabeth and Pope Paul to attend its dedication . They feel this will assure a flood of foreign goods to their island . Kitchener-Waterloo Record , 20.10.714 , then we can , if the inferences to these predictions were validly drawn , work back towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which ones are false , is , of course , problematic . But that the set is collectively false is enough to avoid a relativistic head-shaking , or a mystical gaze , or an ad hoc suggestion that perhaps they should be taken symbolically . Second , we also scrutinize cargo-cult doctrines and their implications for inconsistencies : if the way to get landing strips and jetties for the cargo transports is collective physical work , why is not that the way to get the cargo goods themselves ? If the ancestors care about their dependants , why have they allowed diversion of treasure to go on so long ? So , both empirical evidence and logic can mediate between my . culture and cargo-cult culture because of course I submit my suggestions as to how cultists can achieve their aims to the same tests of evidence and logic . The most extreme , or the logically most swingeing , form of relativism thus becomes that which attempts to suggest that empirical evidence and even logic itself are culturally-bound tests and can not mediate between their culture and cultures with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attack have been overcome by colleagues , // as we shall explain . But here I must stress that these meta-level arguments for cognitive relativism clash with our rationality as I have argued for it , our morality , as I shall argue for it . In setting out to discuss moral relativism , I shall try not to cover old ground where myself and others have trod before.5 I shall digress on some quaint historical aspects , as well as worming my way through philosophical subtleties . Throughout , I shall try to be sympathetic to relativism , to stress its insights , its valid arguments , and the salutary effect its sometimes extreme postures have had on the behaviour of others . I view it as a paradigm case of what Agassi ( 1963 ) calls an intelligent error , or an important error . Yet error it is , and , so , criticized it must be . 2.2 Herskovits on method and practice Let me begin with modern relativism 's most able and sophisticated exponent , the American anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits . He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of a tough-minded facing of facts . He was far from limiting himself to moral relativism . The way Herskovits put it was this : We even approach the problem of the ultimate nature of reality itself . Cassirer holds that reality can only be experienced through the symbolism of language . Is reality , then , not defined and re-defined by the ever-varied symbolisms of the innumerable languages of mankind ? ( Herskovits 1973 , p. 15 ) But setting aside this rather big gulp , what did Herskovits mean by relativism ? The principle of cultural relativism , briefly stated , is as follows : Judgements are based on experience , and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation . Those who hold for the existence of fixed values will find materials in other societies that necessitate a re-investigation of their assumptions . Are there absolute moral standards , or are moral standards effective only as far as they agree with the orientations of given people at a given period of their history ? ( Herskovits 1973 , p. 15 ) Herskovits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practical levels ( see 1973 , p. 32 ) . At the philosophical level , as in the quotation , the question is raised whether there are absolute standards . In a way this is not well formulated . Of course there are absolute moral standards , // Cruelty is wicked ' , and , Eating people is wrong ' , would be examples . So that is not what Herskovits meant . By absolute ' he seems to have meant something like absolutely true ' , true in the absolute ( not relative ) sense ' . It would be hard to argue for this claim , since the mere fact that an absolute truth is denied does not render it either not absolute or not true , only controversial . Probably what Herskovits wanted to say was that there are no universally agreed upon moral truths or judgments . His thesis is about moral theory and argument at the philosophical level . Methodology is rules of procedure , so one might cash methodological relativism out in as if ' terms : act as if , report as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , practice means how we behave : respect other cultures by respecting and obeying their moral standards when you go among them ( if reporting is practice then the latter subsumes methodology ) . Do not cross forbidden social lines , do not eat forbidden food , do not break taboos , give sacrifices to the gods , etc . Herskovits 's contention that relativism can be adopted as a philosophy , a methodology or a practice , is well taken . One can object to the philosophy of relativism while endorsing it as a methodology or a practice . To recommend as a methodological device an attitude of neutrality , to eschew treating the customs of others as disgusting ' , revolting ' or savage ' , at least in the first instance , is quite salutary . This is not to say that later , in the course of more considered judgment , one may not reintroduce such epithets , as for example Colin Turnbull does in his examination of the Ik in The Mountain People ( 1972 ) . This book caused something of a sensation because Turnbull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rules ( or lack of rules ) that filled the reporting anthropologist with horror . He is not the first anthropologist to be less than enamoured of his subjects , but he is the first to have confessed this candidly and at length . Some of his colleagues were anything but pleased by his candour.6 One heard and discounted the scuttlebut only to read with surprise an imperious piece by Fredrik Barth entitled Calling a Colleague to Account ' . Not only was this published in Current Anthropology , a journal with worldwide circulation , but it was given CA* treatment , meaning it was circulated in advance to other scholars , whose comments , together with the author 's reply , appeared alongside the article . So lively was the response that a second round appeared eighteen months later . The gravamen of Barth 's article was that Turnbull had no business qua anthropologist allowing his own emotional reactions to // mode of government in dealing with barbarians , provided the end be their improvement , and the means justified by actually effecting that end . Liberty , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion . Until then , there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne , if they are so fortunate as to find one . . . ( Mill 1859 , p. 263 ) No matter how much of a society 's organization turned on a custom like head-hunting , if it offended the conqueror , it had to go . No matter if the kinship system of a society was completely different from our own , if it encouraged marriage within what Christians considered the prohibited degrees of kinship , then it had to be altered . British colonial officials went to the extent of outlawing dog meat in Hong Kong ! Missionaries , conquerors and colonizers , therefore , are responsible for much behaviour that anthropologists deplore , and rightly so . Anthropologists diagnose what they call ethnocentrism ' , the view that takes it for granted that the principles and practices of your own social or ethnic group are correct and should be used as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an antidote to ethnocentrism , relativism is laudable as practice . Although there is a logical sense in which one 's theoretical interest in another society is always a function of the background from which you came , from your training and preoccupations , there is also an obvious sense in which you must strive to be open to the evidence that you come across in your scientific work . It is all-too-easy to blind oneself to countervailing evidence . Hence one has to try to moderate the tendency to see things in terms of one 's theories , and look for places where that involves stretching them a bit . The encounter between the anthropologist and an alien people is a fascinating version of this struggle to see despite conceptual blinkers , one that should not be over-simplified . Complementing the oversimplifications of the missionary who thinks he carries around God 's word and anyone who thinks anything else needs conversion are the oversimplifications of the anthropologist who suggests that an attitude of respectful acceptance is owed to whatever practices he comes across and that dissembling is justified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anthropological encounter is no more simple than any other human encounter , and is a strange mixture of the encounter of strangers and the encounters of friends ( Jarvie 1968 ) . Curiosity and self-preservation are always involved , but so are decency and respect : and // respect does not endorse cheating and lying . If the anthropologist is in a position where his judgment is seriously sought by people who treat him seriously , I fail to see how he can evade his duty to be honest  --  unless he is in physical danger . He need not share all the views of missionaries and administrators , but he may well share some since it is their culture he comes from , and the question of what views he has and should disclose is not a simple matter . To think that natives only respect those who agree with them , or keep silent , or trickily give undirected responses , 7 may be a way of patronizing them . A fully human relationship includes disagreement and argument , anger as well as love . Barth could with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Studying the Yanomamo for further lessons in the complexity of field relations and the unlovability of some social systems . Barth 's own account in Ritual and Knowledge Among the Baktaran of New Guinea has a self-congratulatory and evasive air . To sum up this discussion of methodological and practical relativism , I see it as a valuable corrective strategy , to be discarded when it undermines the moral and scientific impulses that animate the exploration of the mores of other peoples . Science itself is a product of our culture and social system , one most of us believe generates knowledge that is universal . But universal knowledge is not harmless , and universal knowledge and the search for it is not compatible with all social and cultural arrangements . The enterprise of science is an interventionist one malgre lui . It must then avoid self-deception as well as deception . 2.3 Relativism as a philosophy This brings us to relativism at the philosophical level . Here is where I sharply take issue with Herskovits and believe anthropologists make a fundamental error in following him . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that hits both moral and cognitive , even though my concern at this point is principally with the former , is this . If relativism means something like the idea that all values are culturally induced and hence culture-bound , then anthropology in its traditional sense is impossible . For anthropology would then be simply the pretence of studying and recording other ' systems and their values , when in fact the anthropologist could be doing no more than projecting his own enculturated values on to what he appeared to be studying . Let us now frame this argument in a different way . Intellectual work is the study of problems , i.e. contradictions between statements , either statements of theory contradicted by statements in // fact , or statements of theory contradicted by other statements of theory . ( Popper 1959 ; Hattiangadi 1978/9 ) In going to an alien society to study some problem or other the anthropologist is , then , equipped , first and foremost with some explicit and many implicit theories or theoretical ideas . These are a product of his enculturation in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientist . Coming to an alien culture he is on relativist assumptions simply performing an exercise in reflexivity : he is bringing his culture-bound theories to bear on his culture-bound observations and interpretations of what one might naively speak of as another society . One might well question why he bothers : it seems he can not break out of his enculturating screen , so why not study figments of his own and other people 's imagination : novels , or science fiction , for example ? This sounds far-fetched but it is a crushing point . If we are imprisoned by an enculturating screen then all we ever do is study or work out the implications of ourselves . We are engaged in navel-gazing . But then there is no reason to do anthropology , since the distinction between reality and imagination , fact and fiction , on which the possibility of science rests , does not hold . What has gone wrong here is that Herskovits 's enculturation doctrine is too strong : we are enculturated , no doubt , but we are not trapped or imprisoned behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the break-through , the hope for coming into contact with the world , learning from experience . But relativism , be it noted , is resorted to because its alternative , realism , seems mired in difficulty . How can encultured human beings work with a concept of fact and experience that transcends enculturation ? That concept does not escape the screen . Positivistic views of a given real world , a world of atomic facts describable in a protocol language free of enculturation , are pipe dreams , it is true . Is such a strong absolutism the only alternative to relativism ? Can there not be a weaker , critical absolutism , that treats the concept of a real world , independent of all enculturating screens , not as a secret we can penetrate once and for all , but as a regulative idea to assist our self-critical efforts to transcend the cultural screen whenever we can detect it at work ? Gellner has compared this view , which is highly Kantian , to the writing of a constitution , that is , a basic set of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postulates as a rule of absolutist epistemology that there are no entrenched clauses . No idea , that is to say , can be held immune to challenge , including the idea that no ideas are immune to challenge . The beauty of this metaphor is how clear it makes the normative element in epistemology . Just as we say that the knowledge that all of us are biassed is no excuse for // failing to try to overcome specific biasses we are aware of , so Gellner 's view allows us to say that although we know we are enculturated is no excuse for failing to overcome the specific shortcomings of which we are aware . The moral problem is a close parallel . If we are philosophical relativists then we have to picture ourselves as prisoners of the moral enculturating process that has shaped us , and if we do that , then we must accept a rather odd , and seemingly futile , picture of the act of doing fieldwork . All we could be accomplishing is to bring our enculturated moral views into contact with our enculturated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enculturated and possibly parochial morality into contact with the real facts of the moral behaviour of other peoples . This is not logically possible on the relativist view : we are always looking through the screen . Indeed we can not even formulate the point like that , since the idea that our morality , what we have been enculturated into , is parochial , assumes that it can be contrasted with other and less parochial moralities . This is to assume a form of detachment and transcendence that enculturating relativism declares to be impossible . This very broad line of attack , showing the logical difficulty of extreme relativism , and showing how at the same time it makes nonsense of anthropological practice , is not going to be enough . Were it enough the preaching of relativism would long ago have stopped . This is far from being the case . Some still preach it quite overtly . Many others have retreated to surreptitious relativism , where it is hinted at , or ironical jabs are directed at those who do not display it . It is absorbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because they have not been taught it explicitly . Indeed they are sometimes bamboozled into thinking they do not accept it , but merely practise it . The problem for the relativist arises simply enough : Herskovits reasons that since all value judgments are enculturated , they are and can be valid only in the culture where they arise . Leaving aside the way in which this reifies an abstraction , culture , into a legitimating authority , the argument would probably , be in order if all cultures came up with the same value judgments . But this is not the case . Cultures differ on both large and small matters  --  over suttee and the morality of eating dog meat , over infanticide and the offering of hospitality . So the question is what to make of the diversity of human moral practice , the diversity of human moral codes . Ginsberg 's argument ( 1956 ) that diversity of practice conceals if not unanimity then at least convergence on a single code , we shall come to later . Perhaps the logically broadest matter over which cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known cultures are strong absolutist . Down to very recently our culture was unreservedly absolutist . Relativist sentiments are very ancient but they usually emerge within an absolutist culture . How can an enculturating screen teach some of us to see it as nothing other than that : a local peculiarity ? And does not the vision of us as all screened already transcend screening ? Certainly the argument that those customs which differ from what the speaker 's society accepts are morally objectionable is not a valid argument . But the opposite position , that because customs differ they are all morally equal and to be given blanket endorsement is not valid either . Difference is neither good in itself nor bad in itself . This is easily shown . Some cultures are racialist and practise discrimination against minorities , strangers , foreigners , outsiders or those of other religious persuasions . If the anthropologist winks at this he himself becomes a racialist at one remove . In other words , does the cultural relativist mean to condone or even endorse racialism , child-murder , discrimination , prejudice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very tricky question on the practical as well as the theoretical level . For the relativist anthropologist has used a mixture of empirical and philosophical reasoning to paint himself into a practical corner . His humanitarian impulse to respect and tolerate others may now conflict with his equally humanitarian impulse to help and teach them . Moreover , he refuses to extend his respect and toleration to those of his countrymen who suppress suttee , infanticide and dog meat , as well as go out to preach the gospel of our lord in the colonies . The cultural relativist can argue that he withholds respect because these activities of suppression , while morally approved in the culture of the suppressors , cross the boundary of enculturation and thus become ultra vires . This reply ignores what I have already pointed out , that many if not most cultures extend the writ of their moral judgments beyond their cultural boundaries . On what ground can the anthropologist select out those boundary-crossing judgments and say they are not to be tolerated or endorsed ? As parts of living cultures they are unassailable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what philosophers call reflexive ; it is not so much about moral judgments , as about moral judgments about moral judgments or systems of moral judgment . Moral judgments are self-regarding . We sometimes judge other moral views to be themselves immoral . This reflexivity is difficult to escape . Faced with diverse moral views we can either say there is no way to judge between them , so they are all equally moral or immoral ; or we can say , moral judgments are confined to the cultural and social systems in which they // emerged , and , since there can be no valid intersystemic judgments as they would not stem from a cultural or social system , then there is no means of comparing and assessing them . So , either all moralities are equal , or , moralities are non-comparable and the question of equality does n't arise . But both of these judgments are themselves extra-systemic and hence suspect on the relativists ' own premisses . Put simply , from what social and political context does the moral judgment that diverse moral systems are equal draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it draws it from the context of western society and culture that has given birth both to liberal tolerance and to anthropology . Western thought is imperialistic , tries to conquer other thought systems ; western morality is also imperialistic in that it too tries to conquer other moralities . Most other cultures in contact situations are the same , especially when they are literate or when their system has cognitive power . The difference is that in the west there is also this self-conscious stuff about objective , scientific , tolerant and respectful scientific inquiry . 2.4 The case for and against relativism Summing up so far , when we strip away all the sophisticated manoeuvres I think the case for relativism reduces to two arguments . One of these arguments is invalid , the other is entirely negative . The negative I have already objected to , the invalid argument is one to be sympathized with . The invalid argument stems from the noble aspiration to respect rather than denigrate the views of other people . The negative argument holds that there is no way to solve the reflexivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cross-cultural values ; that they can be justified . The invalid argument goes like this : premiss , let us respect not denigrate the moral views of other people . Premiss , such views are a result of enculturation . Premiss , enculturation takes place within cultures . Conclusion , let us therefore relativize views to cultures , universally phrased prescriptions or proscriptions ( e.g. Honour thy Father and thy Mother ' , or cruelty is wrong ' ) should be interpreted as having the suppressed qualifier , this is moral in this culture ' . The argument is so invalid it is hard to formulate . Respect for the views of others can be expressed by many other means than relativism and relativism may contain elements of condescension  --  the opposite of respect . Trouble begins with the first premiss . The peoples we are busy respecting may themselves not respect that premiss . Our relativistic modesty is not widely // shared . This leads to the further point that the premiss is a moral view and to be consistent must be relativized to our culture  --  it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since our anthropological ancestors displayed ethnocentric attitudes . If we are sensitive we know full well that many people in our culture do not respect other cultures , so our culture enculturates people into both the premiss of respect and that of lack of respect . Why , then , should anthropology be premissed on only one of the two possible views promoted by our culture ? The answer to this question goes to the second argument  --  on what basis can we erect a trans-cultural morality ? The same basis we use to choose between competing moralities in our culture ? And what basis is that ? It is a basis without a base . Bases , like revealed religion , do not solve the problem because some people do not accept them and others can simply question in a Kantian manner where they get their authority . How do we decide moral issues ? We argue them out . We especially concentrate on three lines of attack that are being exemplified in this work : factual inadequacy , inconsistency , and consequences . Arguing against relativism I have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and , since ought implies can , can not implies not-ought ; I have endeavoured to show it to be inconsistent ; and I shall now try to show it has unacceptable consequences , i.e. consequences inconsistent with other moral views we hold , tacitly and explicitly . 1 Relativism ends up by saying what is , is right : that a culture is the way it is and , that its morality endorses that way , implies , on relativist premisses , that what is is right . But what if both the way things are seems immoral and the endorsing of the way things are as moral seems immoral also ? Are these thoughts one is somehow not allowed to articulate ? Do they reveal some depths of superiorist thinking ? 2 This posture of what is is right is itself conservative and antiliberal , since it denounces in advance the forces of change and toleration if they come from outside  --  whatever inside ' and outside ' mean here . But societies , even entrenchedly conservative ones , change , sometimes with startling abruptness , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established morality has been endorsing the status quo and denouncing change . Yet once the change comes about it now has to be endorsed . This is the classic Hobbesian problem that the only revolutions that are justified are those that have already taken place . 3 Cultures or societies are neither homogeneous nor seamless : hence to be tolerant and accepting of them and their morality is vague advice . What exactly is one to be tolerant and accepting RELATIVISM of ? There may be both an establishment and a protest movement , and many shades in between . To what is a member of this society enculturated , then ? What if he is enculturated to believe the official teachings and preachings are all lies and hypocrisy and only outsiders like tourists and anthropologists can be turned to for enlightenment ? ( This is not so far-fetched ; there is a lot of this in the Communist block countries . ) What if the signals are confused and both the doctrines of respect for and condescension towards other moralities is preached ? 4 Relativism all-too-easily reduces to nihilism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there '  --  I have called it an abstraction : it is something we construct , build or imagine to make things coherent . Once one sees this one also sees that although our constructs may be co-ordinated ( as I have explained in Concepts and Society ) , they need not be . If they are not , then each of us mentally constructs something different as culture and hence each of us endorses acculturation to something different . In fact each of us becomes his own judge of morality ( and reality ) , which is a poor premiss for a scientist to begin with . Moreover , for each of us to say what is right is a formula for moral chaos and nihilism. 5 A final consequence of relativism is this  --  it reduces the notion of respect for others to agrees with ' or endorses ' . Yet in our own culture the most famous expression of respect is the slogan , I completely disagree with your views but I will die for your right to express them ! ' Respect has little or nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respect diversity and yet disagree with it . When it comes to head-hunting and eating dogs British colonizers found this beyond their capacity . But in the regulation of land tenure , marriage , inheritance and such like they often enshrined local custom in law . The lesson here is that neither respect nor understanding implies agreement . Let me go back over these numbered points to see if they can be dealt with frontally. 1 ' It is not the case that might is right . On the contrary , might is , very characteristically , wrong . Only in a caricature of a tradition-bound society is might declared to be right . ' The relativist exaggerates the homogeneity and seamlessness of cultures and moralities . Nearly all moral systems , i.e. those subsystems of cultures we call their moral systems , nearly all of them are in a constant state of flux , dispute , argument and review . Otherwise why would most societies have mediators and judges ? But if what we so glibly call a moral system is more a social system than some articulable set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relativist 's omni-tolerance ? It impales him , among other things , on contradictions ; because in endorsing local morality he may be // endorsing simultaneously contradictory views . More important , it gives the anthropologist some moral space of his own . While being reticent and respectful he nevertheless has an obligation to his own views on the matters at hand and , if asked to articulate them would be derelict in his duty to his own moral system ( both the general one and the specialized one of scholars and scientists ) were he to dissemble , pretend he had no views , or otherwise evade . Respect for others presumably means something like not condescending to them , not shielding them for their own good ( in fact for your own good , i.e. as salve to a guilty conscience ) . The fact is that if the anthropologist has been properly enculturated in western society ( a moot point , since so many of them are socially marginal ) then he will go to any lengths to avoid infanticide . Confronted with infanticide on the streets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did nothing . What is different if he is confronted with infanticide in Africa ? The child and its call on him as a moral being are the same , for we assume in both cases he has no connection with it . Practical arguments from personal danger aside , what is the morality of the matter ? At the very least a forceful expression of his views and an offer to explain them ? 2 ' Change is a topic anthropologists have always been ambivalent about . One of their long-term projects has been to record the main features of all extant societies before they are altered or dispersed . This streak of antiquarianism sometimes shows itself in stronger form when they ally themselves with forces resisting change . Such change stems predominantly from the economic and political forces generalized as modernization ' . Wage-labour itself can totally disrupt a society based , let us say , on kinship obligation . If a tribe is forced to wear clothes it has to start operating in such a way that money can be made to purchase the clothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of life they are entitled to and which is worth preserving . Some have collaborated with governments the better to cushion the worst impact of imposed changes on the people they study . Others have become militant advocates of resistance to change . In Canada , Inuit and other native peoples have vigorously opposed development of the Arctic . Many of the arguments smack of those generated by anthropologists . Yet it is not clear change might not bring benefit . 3 ' This applies to the divisions within society too . There are at least two sides to every question , and often more . Relativism is a hopeless platform for responsible decision-making . That can only come from making up one 's own mind by the use of reason , // weighing and assessing arguments and premisses , for their consistency , consequences and factual adequacy . 4 ' I have no doubt that the relativist has an answer to these urgings . Perhaps it could go like this . When we talk for example of believing in the rule of law , we do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean some system of law which may differ from place to place , and indeed is expected to do so . So with morality , we do not want to endorse chaos or lack of morality but some local moral system . What in turn I should say to this is that only Hobbes believed any system of law was better than none ; most of us would say that when we say we believe in the rule of law we mean in a rule of law that is just  --  and this is a transcultural judgment . We may wonder where it comes from , and in the third part of this monograph I shall endeavour to show that it comes from our rationality . At all events , it is preferable to Herskovits 's considered view : There is , indeed , some reason to feel that the concept of freedom should be realistically redefined as the right to be exploited in terms of the patterns of one 's own culture . ( 1973 , p. 9 ) 5 ' Respect should not include respect for exploitation , immorality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because these are the categories of that western culture that gave birth to science and social science does not make them culturally relative . Our culture , like most cultures , formulates its value judgments in universal and categorical form . This is not a philosophical mistake . We mean to reach beyond the immediate , we mean to articulate in the name of the whole of mankind . The universally available tools of reason being applied to the tasks of assessment is the most serious form our human responsibility to ourselves and others can take . By an historical or sociological account of the origins of relativism we can come to understand anthropologists as in reaction against the crimes and misdeeds ( non-relative judgments ! ) of their forebears who came into contact with primitive peoples . Such are the depredations wrought by European colonists and missionaries upon the peoples of the world that no one any longer wants to be associated with them . On the contrary , our impulse is to incorporate those far-away peoples into our moral community and accord them the dignity and respect we accord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I fully sympathize . It has not , however , become embodied in relativism . I think I have shown how the relativist in fact involves himself in a condescending , not an egalitarian , stance towards primitive peoples ; and I have also shown how the primitive peoples themselves and their often // rebarbative moralities can not be conveniently ignored . It takes two to make a moral community . In the absence of such twoway co-operation the problem becomes much more subtle and interesting , and relativism just a gross and uninteresting policy . 2.5 Relativism and diversity I turn back now to the argument from the diversity of morals which is the historical origin of relativism . A The first and most powerful argument on the road to relativism seems to be the fact of diversity in human custom . To be more precise , the same action may be considered moral in one society and immoral in another . If one assumes the premiss that societies can not be ranked in a way that makes the judgment of one override the judgment of another in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such an action is or is not immoral can not be answered . Instead the question has to be rephrased as , moral or immoral from the point of view of this society ' . This moves us towards relativism one step . Herskovits sums it up thus : Cultural relativism developed because the facts of differences in these concepts of reality or in moral systems . . . forced the realization of the problem of finding valid cross-cultural norms . In every case where criteria to evaluate the ways of different peoples have been proposed . . . the question has at once posed itself : Whose standards ? ' ( 1958 , p. 270 ) B Not only is there disagreement about how to slot actions into the moral categories , there is also a lack of agreement between different societies as to what the moral categories are . For example some societies may not have the category cruelty ' ; others may rank the categories differently ; still others may have categories like face ' or honour ' that scarcely exist any more in our society.8 Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , it follows that there are no fixed categories of morality , and how an act should be classified can be discussed only relative to social ( or cultural ) units . C So , while all societies have morality , their particular moralities differ as well as overlap , and there appears to be no way of transcending society to evaluate these clashes ( from which society would these standards come ? ) . It seems to follow that there are no universal moral rules , there are no absolute values . The consequence of all this is that all moralities are equal . If society X differs from society Y over a moral matter then both are right . What is , is right . What is , it so happens , is decided by // power and force  --  what else ? Moreover , whatever is enforced as right , is right and must be obeyed  --  on what grounds can it be dissented from ? An alternative view has as it were no claim , since it is not enforced and hence is not the morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any other legitimation , whether local or transcendental , it de-legitimates itself . The logic of this argument is not usually pushed through , but I think it should be . Not only is it true that societies differ on moral matters : but individuals within societies differ on moral matters too . Think of divisions between Protestants about war , the death penalty , abortion , permissiveness , punishment . And this despite the fact that they may well appeal ostensibly to the same moral system to buttress their claims . But if a system of moral authority is susceptible of different interpretations then the question arises of which interpretation is correct . For example , there are Christians who maintain that only pacifism is compatible with their religion , and there are Christians who can reconcile their religion to patriotic wars and there are Christians who supported the Crusades . In Iran there are zealots intent on killing people for all sorts of crimes in the name of Islam , and there are others who say all this is against the spirit of the religion . Cargo-cult societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if moral systems are legitimated by social embedding , and even if there are not alternative systems competing within the society , the given system still has to be interpreted . If the clashes of interpretation are between groups then presumably again morality is settled by a struggle for power . If it is not then we must raise doubts as to whether the society in question has anything corresponding to a single , coherent system of morality . If the clashes of interpretation are between individuals , if , as a thought experiment , we imagine that every man has his own interpretation , then it looks as though we have no morality at all , because moral systems are socially or culturally limited , they can not be validated relative to single individuals . Later , in the next part of this monograph , I shall show how these arguments can be generalized to the cognitive field and yield an epistemological relativism . I do not treat it in detail here because there is a seriousness to moral relativism that is lacking in epistemological relativism . Moral relativism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most admirable of motives . Epistemological relativism is , I am sorry to say , more like a plaything for intellectuals , a doctrine that no one takes seriously for a minute , but which is preached mainly because people argue themselves into it and then ca n't find any way out . Such a presumption on common sense is frivolous . // Peter Winch , who does not refer to Herskovits and who , I think , does not like to be called a relativist , has developed the enculturation of values argument most carefully by fusing the data of Evans-Pritchard with the philosophy of the later Wittgenstein ( 1958 , 1964 ) . His manoeuvre goes something like this . The meaning of what we say and do can be found by attending to the use we make of what we say and do . Use involves seeking out the patterns or rules to which our saying and doing seem to conform . Rules and patterns looked at generally seem to go to make up what we might call forms of life : forms are clusters of coherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference point for meaning . Forms of life ' , an expression that comes from Wittgenstein , is not the same as culture or society ( indeed it is not quite clear what it is as a glance at the exegetes will show9 ) , but it is not wholly unlike that either . In Winch 's use , forms of life seem to be intra-cultural as well as inter-cultural : he treats religion and science as forms of life , as well as Britain and the Azande . But for a moment stick to the inter . For Winch , truth , rationality and logic itself are bound to forms of life.io If the Azande are uninterested in consistency that shows that what they will accept as logic is perhaps different from what we will . Of course , by this logic , the problem of relativism can easily be resolved . If we are as it were free to choose our own logic then those of us who oppose relativism can simply attach ourselves to conventional logic and demand consistency and apply that standard wherever we see fit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistency we can simply insist that it has to be smoothed out . Even more simply , we can dismiss the arguments of the antirelativists by showing that from a contradiction everything follows so there will be no refuting , hence no arguing with , those who repudiate logic . Then why bother ? Faced with some of these bewildering and even nihilistic consequences of relativism there are those anthropologists and others who back away from it and seek an exit . I want to discuss three of these exits and show that however plausible they may appear , they are nevertheless rather weak and do n't do the trick . Exits . The Ginsberg manoeuvre goes something like this . " l True there are diverse moral views and practices around the world , but there is also an interesting amount of overlap and agreement . Murder , theft and adultery , for example , are penalized everywhere ; courage and honesty valued . Perhaps we can overcome the diversity of morals by attending to this overlap and agreement . Indeed , on an evolutionary scale , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convergence , a core of moral ideas // on which there is agreement surrounded by an accretion of lesser ideas . Areas of disagreement are those which are less important , less central , and on which agreement is less urgently required . The rational man seeking moral guidance in the chaos of diversity might look to these cores of agreement and use them as a starting point , at least , to work his way out of the chaotic diversity . There are two troubles with the Ginsberg manoeuvre . The first is that consensus does not legitimate ideas because we can always make the judgment that the consensus view is morally mistaken , and we can even judge the consensus method of deciding any moral issue to be itself morally mistaken . If we are told that 85 percent of the peoples of the world live in societies that do not condone but strongly penalize murder , we are still at liberty to argue that they are mistaken and the other 15 percent are right , and , further , to maintain that it is immoral to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the areas of disagreement , diversity , are being wished away rather than reasoned away . It has to be shown that areas of disagreement are less rather than more important , and that we might better concentrate on them . In science , after all , the problematic areas where we expect change and growth are precisely those where scientists disagree . Lack of moral convergence and consensus might similarly be areas of moral growth and progress . Popkin has argued that the radical millenarianism of the seventeenth century paved the way for the rational and secular enlightenment of the eighteenth . The same might be true of cargo cults . Radical dissent from the colonial morality can be a learning experience not only for the cargo cultists but also for the colonial administrators and missionaries . Values of orderly administration and of Christian worship might , after dialogue with cultists , come to seem low on any reasonable priority scale . Thus diversity-relativism is incoherent . Exit2 , the G. E. Moore manoeuvre , 12 proceeds somewhat differently by arguing that the source of morality is not some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of what might be called a basic moral intuition with which we are all endowed . We may learn and refine this in our upbringing , but it legitimates morality , not the other way around . Hence , the diversity of morals is to be handled by referring back to our basic moral intuitions ( knowledge of the good ) and acting in accordance with them , regardless of the prevailing view here or elsewhere . Apart from the trouble you can get in if your intuitions are grossly discrepant from those of others in your surroundings , there , is the little matter of disputes being unresolvable : you appeal to your intuitions , I appeal to mine and we may end up with moral chaos again . So // much for intuitionist relativism . Exit3 , the evolutionist manoeuvre , is to look at the diversity of morals and ask whether there is change , and to ask whether the change has any direction . That is to say , can we see evidence in our society or in the scene as a whole of something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : treating all men and eventually all men and women alike ? Can we see codes being more just ? Can we see greater humanity and compassion displayed towards wrongdoers in their treatment and punishment ? Duncker ( 1939 ) offers a variant of this when he maintains that valuation turns on meaning and meaning is a function of its social situation . For example , infanticide may be not murder but a sacrifice to the gods , or a guaranteed entry into heaven for the child . Hence he concludes : given the same situational meanings an act is likely to receive the same ethical valuation . If an act is found to receive different valuations at different times or places , this is generally found to be due to different meanings ' ( p. 44 ) . In fact , the same act , being the same with regard to all meanings involved , has never been observed to incur different valuations ' ( p. 50 ) . Bravery , justice , generosity have never been seen as vices . This does not mean relativism or lack of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lay claim to the title of moral evolution or progress . . . the advance from a conception of man as an incarnation of magical forces to the conception of man as a self-centred ( " Moral " ) personality ' ( p. 52 ) . In more modern terms we might say that any act can be included under numerous different descriptions . If we are to debate relativism we have , of course to ensure that we are talking about the same act , with the same meaning , i.e. under the same description . The problems with this exit are fairly blatant . The notion of progress is itself a moral one and so can hardly be introduced ex nihilo in order to assess the shortcomings and triumphs of moral systems . So we ca n't defend evolutionary relativism . Where does all this leave us , then ? At an impasse ? The complete picture of the way out I propose comes in part three because it is intimately connected with the view of human rationality I am also engaged in putting forward . A preliminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be left hanging by the basically destructive series of arguments I have been busy marshalling in re relativism . To begin with , relativism 's first mistake is to argue that we can evade the responsibility of making assessments and judgments by relating them to culture : there is no way this can be avoided . Even to declare them relative to culture is itself an evaluation stemming from this culture and // hence denying the universalist and transcendental claims of many of the systems being discussed . The believer in Islam , like the Roman Catholic , most definitely does not consider his morality culture bound : it is universally applicable and absolutely true . Whether he or she chooses militantly to implement this view is a matter of individual choice that does not affect the logic of his position . So cultural relativism , posing as neutral arbiter between views , clashes with those which do not allow there to be a neutral arbiter . Relativism also clashes with practice : few are the anthropologists who do not have strong moral views about some of the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In practice one has views , and to reassure oneself that they are merely a matter of enculturation is no comfort . We might be torn by the conviction that were the societies we are studying to gain a little in affluence it might be possible for them also to develop different and perhaps more humane means of ordering their social intercourse . To go further : it is immoral and irresponsible to preach and attempt to practise relativism . It is on a par with walking by on the other side of the street when you see a person being attacked . Hatch ( 1983 , p. 95 ) utilizes the self-same image : if we hear screams coming from a dark alley how can we walk away and maintain it is none of our business ? It is of course possible that we got it wrong , that the screams are theatre , or are of pleasure , or the apparent villain is victim , but these hypotheticals do not excuse indifference . Neither the decision to help nor its implementation involves any assumption of our superiority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , involve one distinction Hatch overlooks : that between the actor and the intervener , between the self and the other , between the observer and the observed . Our conception of ourselves as acting agents involves the idea of separateness , of boundaries between them and us . The test of the existence of such boundaries consists in our view that the screams are not there merely because we are , are not therefore figments of our imaginations , they would be there even if we were not , would continue were we to pass by . So we have the option of moving the boundary of ourselves towards the boundary of the person screaming to engage in interaction . No doubt this comparison will seem shocking and unfair . I do n't think it is , and I think anthropologists who preach relativism preach it innocently with the excellent motives and bad logic I have outlined . We have a responsibility to science and we have a responsibility as human beings . Every human being has a call on // us , and , no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not acting responsibly or morally , and we are undervaluing the peoples with whom we are in contact . What we owe our fellow man , as scientists and as members of the moral community , is respect . If he does not respect us as a matter of principle ( because we are white , Jewish or whatever ) it is absurd to adopt a stance of relativist indifference . The respect we owe him ( leaving aside that we owe it to ourselves to protect our own safety first ) entails that we not blind ourselves to his prejudices , but inform him of them , and try our best to indicate that the good life can be lived without the benefit of these props , or , if it can not , that it is better to impoverish life a little than to endorse such mistakes . Notice that I am concentrating on the acute situation where the visitor is himself the victim of his own relativism . I stress again and again that we must not infantilize those we are in contact with . Our moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted evolutionary strategy . They are ( or should be ) carefully thought-out attempts to regulate the relations of human beings both as to means and as to ends . Those with whom we disagree may have different values , in which case we have a clash to negotiate , or they may not have thought things out clearly or thoroughly enough . Either way we learn from them and about them by disclosing ourselves and our thinking and judgment . Anything less is indefensible . 92 In my discussion of rationality I argued a series of points : ( 1 ) that we should generalize the sociological model of rational action as goal-directed action , and subsume under it so-called rational thinking , rather than vice versa ; ( 2 ) that rational thinking is a problem-solving activity and the paradigm of problem-solving is science ( not chess ) ; hence ( 3 ) the usual elevation of science into a model of rationality would make sense . It is not hard to see how these points , if accepted , would pose an awkward dilemma for anthropologists . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A principal goal of anthropology is to give a rational reconstruction of such pre-scientific societies and their customs as being goal-directed and hence intelligible . Yet when anthropologists come to the cognitive systems of these societies , to their practical and theoretical knowledge-claims , to their world-views and cosmologies , they can not gainsay the fact that these fall somewhat short of science . Various strategies for evading the obvious conclusion  --  that there is a limit to the rationality of the societies anthropologists study  --  were discussed in 1.6 . If rationality has to do with goaldirectedness , and if the most effective efforts to achieve goals are those based on correct information about the world , then the possibility ( not the fact ) of rationality increases linearly with the growth of knowledge . Thus , while it does not follow that societies possessing science are more rational than those without , it does follow that such societies have the greater potential rationality and the potential to improve their own degree of rationality . This grates on anthropologists ' sensibilities because it smacks of late nineteenth-century evolutionist anthropology with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the rationality of science consists not so much of thought // processes of a special and exclusive kind , but of a means of organizing thought , of a set of social institutions , then we need deny no society some rationality and potential for more . To say that this society invented the transistor but that this one did not is no slur ; and it need be no slur to say that this society invented the social institutions of science and that this did not . Both transistors and science are exportable , although success with the latter is harder to achieve . In the second part of this monograph , I argued that moral relativism is untenable for the simple reaon that it is condescending , it does not take moral disagreement seriously . It gives blanket endorsement to alternative systems , leaving one 's own system unchallenged and intact . This is to entrench , to circumscribe , alternatives ; the only function such circumscription can have is to protect oneself . Only a genuinely reflective dialogue embodies the ideals of rationality ( applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . Rationality and relativism , I suggested , were two of the fundamental problems of anthropology : the problem of making sense of societies and the problem of comparing societies . The third problem to which I come now , was that of the relation of rationality to relativism , the problem of reconciling the rational unity of mankind with the moral unity of mankind . The problem of the relation of rationality and relativism has two parts : is it rational to be a moral absolutist rather than a moral relativist ; and is it moral to be a rationalist ? These formulations are somewhat gnomic , so I will unpack them before proceeding . At the beginning of this monograph we formulated the problem of the rational unity of mankind as what demarcates man from the beasts . The solution was that mankind is united in possessing the disposition and capacity to apply reason to tasks in order continually to get better at applying reason to tasks . The problem of relativism is that of sustaining the idea that mankind is a moral unity as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral systems in actual practice . What is the relation of this idea of moral unity to that of rational unity ? Are they simply two possible uniting ideas plucked out of all the logical possibilities ? My contention shall be that they are opposite faces of each other . That my model of the rational unity of mankind envisages mankind as a moral community ; that my vision of the moral community reasoning together is also a rational unity . One task to which we apply reason is that of life together . Human beings necessarily live in groups because of the demands of sexual reproduction and because many earthly environments // are too hostile for the single individual to survive in them . The result of reflection on this problem is what we call morality : rules to live by . The disposition and capacity to apply reason to tasks is what we use to cope with our environment . The better to survive together we utilize reason . We see then that applying reason to living together yields morality , and applying morality to living together yields reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the problems are formulated together and solved together . A rationality which also allows relativism is self-defeating ; relativism can not be sustained in the face of rationality . I shall proceed to deal with these topics in four sections : 3.1 Relativism in its cognitive dimension ; 3.2 The connection of rationality with weak absolutism ; 3.3 The connection of weak absolutism with rationality . A fourth section can also stand as an epilogue : Anthropology as sociocultural transcendence. 3.1 Relativism in its cognitive dimension The connection of morality and learning may be hard to grasp , so I shall proceed now to show how moral relativism generalizes into cognitive relativism and how that in turn undermines rationality . We can then consider the connection of moral to cognitive relativism and set up the discussion of the rationality-relativism issue . The relativism that is particularly influential these days is general cognitive relativism , a quite extraordinary generalization of moral relativism . Corresponding to the diversity of morals , there is the diversity of cognition . We in the West have some very clear ideas about where jeeps and lanterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different ideas . Any naive suggestion that we are correct and they are mistaken can be dispelled by experiment . Yali , a cargo cult leader , had spent time in Australia and was by no means unaware that consumer goods were produced by work and organization . But it was after he returned that he was gradually sucked into the cargo cults of his culture . Of course , one could simply conjure up a primitive mentality ' incapable of grasping the truth about things , but that is hardly compatible with the rational unity of mankind . Yali . . . assumed that white men had God and Jesus Christ , who were ultimately responsible for their material culture . This did not conflict with what he saw or otherwise learnt of industrial Australia : the sugar mill , brewery , tinned meat and // fish factories , and the aircraft repair shop . He was aware that Europeans could make their own goods , but he nevertheless believed that their God had taught them the requisite secular techniques . . . Moreover , the Europeans ' God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending cargo ready made and direct in times of shortage and adversity . This explained the vast fleets of ships and aircraft which suddenly came to New Guinea during the war ( Lawrence 1964 , p. 128 ) . Such a case is a great tonic to the relativist . He thinks it shows that reality ( and hence the truth of where jeeps come from ) is a social construction that varies from society to society across the earth . For Yali cargo is the explanation of what happens . The struggle for what you believe in must go on . Westerners must try to accept Cargo on its own terms , not theirs , for Cargo is a reality , even though their westernconditioned minds tell them it is impossible . . . . For , in a sense any expectation of a reward or a return , gratuitously given by some other force ' , physical or intangible , might be described as Cargo ( Rice 1974 , p. xv ) . From the sharp clash of views about how things are and from the seeming irresolubility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be some large or more general barrier to communication . The culprits can be identified as truth and logic . We westerners operate under the view that what is true , is true once and for all , here , now and everywhere for all time . Similarly , we operate with a notion of logic , of principles of inference , that are universally valid in all languages and cultures . But what if we want to say that Yali is correct in his culture and we are correct in our culture ? What if we want to say that the logic that we think of as inexorable , e.g. a jeep is either made by machines or it is not , is challenged by a logic that says that jeeps are made by machines and they are not because they are made by the spirits ? Certainly there is no way this dispute can be resolved . As a model for such a dispute we can take Lewis Carroll 's famous paper on how to convince a doubting Thomas : in this case a doubting tortoise.2 If someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no amount of additional premisses attempting to make the transparency transparent will serve to shift the doubter . As Bartley ( 1962 ) shows in his classic discussion of this paper , the argument has turned from one about the world to one about logic , it has moved to the meta-level and is not straightforward at all . When logic is in dispute logic will not help , but meta-logic might . // The relativist does n't know about meta-logic , he knows only that there is a dispute that seems irresoluble . It seems that when a dispute is irresoluble then the choice of sides , the backing of the winner , can no longer be decided by truth or by logic . Truth and logic can be invoked only after sides have been taken ; truth and logic are tied to , or are relative to , the system of ideas one chooses to attach oneself to . The most general systems of ideas are called cultures.3 So it might seem that truth and logic are relative to cultures . In a plural culture like our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture-area in which there are many subcultures that have their own ideas about logic and truth : the various systems of religion , including secular religions like Marxism and Freudianism , their irrationalist , dogmatic and traditionalist proponents all seeming to fly in face of any general logic and any standard notion of truth . Truth and logic are functions of the ultimate commitments embedded in general belief systems . Such ultimate commitments need not be thought of as conscious choices in the face of dilemmas.4 On the cultural scene they are far more likely to be positions to which people have been enculturated long before they were aware there were choices to make . Communication , on this commitment view , basically only takes place within cultures sharing ultimate commitments and hence notions of truth and logic . Cross-cultural communication , in the sense of dispute about what is so and what is not can not take place . Shifts of position by cultures , or subcultures , whether over time or not have to be explained sociologically , by impact ' phenomena such as drift , depredations of oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political revolution . Commitment denies the idea that rationality is a bootstrap process of constant attempts to improve our achievement by given standards and of attempts to improve those standards themselves ( see Agassi 1973 and Briskman 1977 ) . That logic and truth and hence rationality are culture-specific is a radical relativism and , I am inclined to think , clashes with the facts . Such evidence as I have seen suggests that most primitive peoples understand intuitively the principles of good argument ; have a correspondence theory of truth ; and distinguish rational conduct much as we do . Yet a whole school of thought exists that denies this . There is Peter Winch , D. Z. Phillips , Rush Rhees and , in some incarnations , A. MacIntyre . Their views are congruent with those of Toulmin who ( 1958 ) argued that logic is not even universal to our own culture  --  it is not uniformly used . We are being rational when we act as lawyers , or inductive scientists , so that category of the rational has to be seen as broader // than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my own position . Certainly rationality  --  goal-directed action  --  is a broader category than action that conforms to the rules of logic . The issue comes over just how the broader and narrower are thought to relate to each other . The post-Wittgensteinian writers I have referred to think the broader can only be captured by some extra-logical explication . Whereas my suggestion is to see logic as the structure or skeleton of rationality and to formulate the programme not of going beyond logic ( and abandoning , for example , the rules of valid inference as Toulmin does ) , but , rather , of expanding and enriching logic . My model here , clearly , is Popper 's path-breaking work in The Logic of Scientific Discovery where , while strictly conforming to the basic rules of logic , he offered other rules for the rational conduct of science to supplement them . What makes the Wittgensteinians take up their posture ? Apologetics for their secret or not so secret religious convictions which they want to shield from the harsh criticism of logic and the facts ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , which reifies basic British bourgeois complacency ( Gellner 1959 ) ? In this they have different motives from the other great relativist input : Mannheim 's sociology of knowledge that is an outgrowth of the Marxist notion of false consciousness ' and the reality principle , but which draws back from unchecked cultural relativism . What can be said against cultural relativism ? Does none of our learning , does not especially the cognitive power of science , transcend it ? Can we not discriminate good from bad goals , stultifying from liberating institutions , efficient from inefficient customs ? Four ways of making such discriminations and hence of escaping the consequences of cultural relativism are known to me , that of the sociology of knowledge , that of pragmatism , that of Winch and that of the view which I espouse . Each of these is different . Escape 1 : sociology of knowledge . Mathematics and logic were sacred for Mannheim , as was , in his later work , science . This creates the dilemma , what about the science of sociology ? Mannheim was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcending science , and hence its practitioners in some way enlightened , freed from the conditioning of the total ideology in which they were otherwise enculturated , able to see beyond the screen . The trouble is , to everyone else this looks like wishful thinking.6 If the sociologist can exempt himself from socioanalysis , can see through his own enculturating screen , then maybe others can too . Mannheim 's arguments , like Herskovits 's , were too strong : they sprang the self-referring trap . // Escape 2 : pragmatism . Pragmatism is the ( relativist ) view that what is true is what works , and that what works may from time to time and place to place be very different . Hence true ' is relative to time and/or place , what Duncker ( 1939 ) calls situation ' . So it is not that relativism leads nowhere , but rather that it confines us to in situ appraisal of goals , customs and institutions . If they work , well and good , if not they are wanting . The simplest objection to pragmatism is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are untrue , and what is true sometimes will not work . Connecting the two makes it difficult to explain changes and fixities in our ideas , which we usually attribute to the effort to bring the two into line . Escape 3 : Winch Has been patented by Peter Winch  --  each society has its own concepts , its own world ' , and yet they connect with each other somehow through their common confrontation with the basic facts of human life : not earth , air and fire , but birth , copulation and death  --  these are conceptualized by all cultures and hence we have some sort of benchmark for beginning cross-cultural dialogue . This solution is very Ginsberg-ish.7 Communication , however , implies disagreement as well as agreement ; stressing the one at the expense of the other is inadequate . Winch wants to explore and wonder at other systems of conceptualizing birth , copulation and death . Magic is the web of thought that can not think itself to be wrong . This , as other negative commentators were quick to point out , endorses Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain elsewhere ( 1970 ) , the key problem is that Winch shifts the task of anthropology from that of explaining other cultures to that of understanding other cultures . The two are very different : there are clear criteria for explanation , none for understanding . Practitioners of a local culture can be said to understand it . They can also , without inconsistency , be said to be utterly unable to explain it . The situation might be compared to the buyers and sellers at a street market . All they may know is that they assemble regularly and engage in trade . If we want an explanation of why they do so , and why in certain ways , and why there are certain outcomes , economics , not the informants , is where we should seek help . Similarly with belief systems . They may be understood by their believers in a limited sense , or in a sense that sets the standard , but they can not explain themselves . Furthermore , in fact , belief systems are constructs  --  abstractions from the congeries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ideas on the ground . People do not necessarily know of themselves as part of a belief-system , just as the idea that people always know // what to do and what they are doing in social life is naive . They are often doubtful and uncertain . This applies to conduct , values and beliefs . 3.2 The connection of weak absolutism with rationality Escape 4 : comes from the work of Popper , Agassi , Bartley and Gellner . We do as a matter of course make cross-cultural and interpersonal value judgments without any sense of inappropriateness . We do make transcultural , transpersonal knowledge claims ( magic is false , e.g. ) without guilt . Most important : communication precedes language ( else how did it start ? ) So argument between those with basically different even mutually unintelligible views does transpire . How ? By self-correcting struggle to do what so many philosophers ' arguments in principle declare to be impossible . Such as is modelled in this monograph . Let me now develop relativism in its extreme epistemological form and show how it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proposed , a concept which is not ethnocentric but which draws on no more than the human abilities to learn from experience and to communicate . The fundamental philosophical argument behind epistemological relativism is this . There is no way of mediating cross-cultural disagreement . If a conceptual system orders the world in a way different from the one we are used to , discussion between them will lead to a non-terminable disagreement.8 To a westerner rice is rice , snow is snow , cows are cows ; yet Asians can distinguish many kinds of rice , including some they feed only to animals but which we would eat , Eskimos distinguish many kinds of snow , and Nuer distinguish umpteen kinds of cow . Now , you can say , making such discriminations is a matter of training , like learning to hear ' the tones in spoken Cantonese . It takes time , but the differences are there to be grasped . What , then , if your informants tell you that misfortune is due to witchcraft , and witchcraft is a substance detectable at a post-mortem examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a passage between the left side and the right sides of the heart ? What if someone tells you health and disease turn on a balance between hot and cold , dry and wet , yin and yang , strange and poisonous conditions ? We can cut open ever so many bodies and find no witchcraft substance and no hole in the heart and yet fail to convince believers . We can even develop an elaborate and quite successful alternative explanation of health and disease and find that it does not appeal to those convinced otherwise . The world really is the way we see it , then , and like the duck-rabbit drawing , or the // protruding and recessive cube drawing , there is no correct exclusive way to see it . Let us look at a highly sophisticated philosophical formulation of this , W. T. Jones 's world-view relativism ( Jones 1980 ) . Jones notes the fact that persons have differing dispositions , both cognitive and attitudinal , and suggests ordering these differences on scales . Thus some of us may be very prejudiced towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us indifferent , some of us quite positive about them , some of us warm and welcoming . These are attitudes , but a similar scale could be constructed of cognitive **29;39;TOOLONG . Jones discusses very general dimensions such as those involving a preference for the static rather than the changing , those preferring immediacy to distance , continuity to discreteness . Bias to one or other poles of such dimensions causes one to focus on features of experience ignored or minimized by those of different bias . Hence diametrically opposed theories may be developed . Scrutinizing the metaphors and implicit assessments of Brand Blanshard 's Reason and Goodness , Jones argues : a philosophical theory . . . reflects a pre-theoretical vision of the world . . . the vision renders the theory and the doctrine convincing  --  to those who share the vision . . . . From Hume 's vision of reality the principle of induction can not be defended ; from Blanshard 's , it can not be challenged . Each is led to his conclusion by considerations that to him are irrefutable but to his opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a difference in world-view generates nonterminable disagreements . ( p. 326 ) Reflecting on possible challenges , he agrees that his view can not be proved , because proof itself is a feature of , and relative to , a different world view ( p. 330 ) . And he then considers the selfrefuting argument : that relativism absolutizes itself and thereby becomes incoherent ' ( p. 335 ) . His answer is blunt : But world-view relativism relativizes relativism , and relativizes it to a particular world-view . An absolutized relativism argues for relativism and seeks to prove it . A relativized relativism eschews attempts to prove relativism , for it views argument and proof as relative to a particular world-view ; they are part of the way of life ' for which rationalists opt ( p. 335 ) . This leads him to suggest that world-view relativism is not inconsistent  --  even though consistency as a value is a function of some world-views and not others . The crucial question becomes , then , is change of world-view // possible , and if so how does it come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , but not by rational means , but rather by emotional means : shock treatment and therapy . Non-terminable disagreements are to be leaped not by argument or proof but by persuasion . This position itself , and all possible replies to it seem to Jones to presuppose the point at issue namely , do all views presuppose the point at issue ? Suppose , then , that Jones is right : that relativism can be consistently formulated so that it does not exempt itself and become incoherent . Must it then be embraced ? Is it true , is it persuasive ? Readers who have stayed with me so far will know that from my world-view there is no way I could agree to that . Indeed , I believe the enterprise of human intellectual endeavour is the articulation and criticism and hence improvement of world-views . Unlike Jones and Winch , I think there is a consistent meta-language where we can transcend world-view bias by discussing it . Jones 's paper itself is in the meta-language and could not be written were it not available . To put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' can only be raised if it can be raised without presupposing an answer . If raising it presupposes an answer then it has n't been raised and hence has n't been answered . But this tortuous reply is not really required , given Jones 's formulation . All I need for my own claims is to say that , from the world-view I am stuck with , science is a universal and transcendent enterprise , that anthropology stems from that tradition , and hence appraisal , by anthropologists , of the cognitive and moral efforts of the people they study is intrinsic , presupposed . Anthropologists are using relativist arguments as a form of overkill . Not linking the actual judgments and views of their predecessors and some contemporaries such as Turnbull , they inconsistently maintain that all judgments are out of place . Hence it was possible for an high priest of relativism to be engaged in drafting for the United Nations a statement of Human Rights ( Jarvie 1975a ) . But , a relativist must argue that whether humans have rights as well as what those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concrete differences observable on these matters in the world . So what authority can Herskovits or the UN assert in these matters ? Jones 's argument is similar to Winch 's and is one that has been seized on by religious apologists , who saw it as an unassailable defence in the warfare with science ( White 1896 ) . Instead of allowing that science and religion are competing cognitive systems , world-views which explain , in which science comes off best , they can treat each as a sort of culture , way of life ' , conceptual scheme , or domain sufficient unto itself , not in competition , not even in // communication with each other . Religion and science become two different ways of life and thought and no clash between them is possible . Evans-Pritchard would not buy this : It is an inevitable conclusion from Zande descriptions of witchcraft that it is not an objective reality . The physiological condition which is said to be the seat of witchcraft , and which I believe to be nothing more than food passing through the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they attribute to it and the rest of their beliefs about it are mystical . Witches , as Azande conceive them , can not exist . ( p. 63 ) Ironically , it was from this passage that Peter Winch developed his ingenious version of radical relativism . Unlike Herskovits , Winch does not like to be called or thought of as a relativist.9 Winch attempts to fuse Evans-Pritchards 's grasp of the Azande world-view with the philosophy of the later Wittgenstein , to show that everything Evans-Pritchard.says is in order , down to the point where he says that witchcraft is false . Winch argues that it makes no sense to say that there are no witches . For the Azande there are ; their entire conception of the world embodies them . Forms of life have their rules , we can not step outside and say the rules are wrong , for whose rules then govern our discourse ? None ? But then discourse would not be possible . The Azande do n't worry about inconsistency , especially the inconsistency between witchcraft and apparent facts of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rational , even what is logical will vary from culture to culture and no extra-cultural court of appeal exists to adjudicate differences . Well , Evans-Pritchard thought there were no witches , and so do I. ( Although not because they are mystical , and , also , I do not agree that they can not ' exist . They can ; it is just that they do n't . ) In general , I think science , being super-rational , deserves credit for being nearer the truth than the world-view systems that preceded it . There is no way to turn base metals into gold , there is no influence of the stars on our lives , much disease is caused by the invasion of micro-organisms , not hexing ; the fickle finger of fate distributes misfortune mostly by chance , and so on . Moreover , we can argue the toss . It is not easy to argue these matters , but were it not possible , the progress of our own society from superstition and ignorance , to slightly less superstition and ignorance would be unintelligible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . But a rational account of these // changeovers is more plausible , is a better explanation than uncomprehending leaps from one world-view to another . Gellner in Legitimation of Belief argues in effect that the kind of relativism promoted by Jones and Winch is true for all prescientific cognitive systems . They are incommensurable in details because there are deep divisions of underlying world-view that can not be settled . As a bloc they are commensurable because of this similarity : they show little or no cognitive power , no selfstarting ability to progress , no separation of cognitive activity from the rest of the social . A huge ditch separates those systems where cognition , pollution , taboo , religion , social status , kinship and so on are all mixed together , from the cognitive system we call science ' . Gellner picks out four features of science that mark it off from systems on the other side of the Big Ditch . These are cognitive division of labour ; no entrenched clauses ; not judging in their own cause ; and mechanism . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better negative set for characterizing the sorts of thought-systems science had to free itself from . By the cognitive division of labour Gellner has in mind not the development of specialized expert roles or anything like that , but rather a doctrine about concepts . Since I am allergic to concepts , I shall talk about ideas . Translated to idea-talk , Gellner is saying that pre-scientific thought-systems use the same ideas for all sorts of purposes . An idea we might characterize as religious can also be used to cure illness , to predict eclipses or explain history . It is an enormous advance when this sort of wide use is overcome , and ideas are developed with precise domains of application . By no entrenched clauses , Gellner is drawing attention to the way many pre-scientific belief-systems allow a degree of freethought strictly circumscribed by certain entrenched ideas that can not be challenged . The most obvious case would be certain deep-seated religious ideas that must not be challenged on pain of death . There may be subtler examples of abstract ideas so much part of the texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim of the scientific world-view is to hold all questions open , allow all existing ideas to be challenged , to forbid entrenched clauses in the cognitive constitution . Boundaries of sacredness , pollution , centrality , ancientness , wide respect and so on , are all surmountable . Indeed , to the extent that science has deep roots in the questioning attitude of Socrates and Sextus , science virtually conceives it as a duty to challenge the received wisdom . By ideas not being judges in their own cause Gellner has in mind something along these lines . Science depends upon replacing traditional or received means of adjudicating among ideas with // means that are not themselves under the control of the possessors of those ideas , or of the ideas themselves . The analogy is in the attempt in legal systems to develop a court system of judge and jury that tries to determine the facts and apply the law disinterestedly . In practice this is very hard to do . It does not follow that it is impossible , or that because all attempts fall short to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim are equally futile . Similarly , while such notions as truth , reality and empiricism are full of philosophical troubles , the cognitive situation without even the attempt at them is much worse . Finally mechanism . Here Gellner takes over a widely held characteristic of the scientific world-view , namely that it explains the natural world by natural means , and that these means are not extraordinary and depend upon mechanisms and processes that are in principle open to inspection by anyone . Scientists are not priests administering mysteries , despite occasional resemblances in their guild organization and enigmatic style of utterance . Science is an activity open to all who will master it , not surrounded in any essential way by initiation ritual , and taking pride in its claim to expose all its ideas and their backing to public scrutiny , both expert and lay . In a way , and here I go beyond Gellner  --  or back to Bacon  --  the mission of science is consciously democratic and egalitarian . Scientists aim to rethink our world-view and so in the long run have the aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 , 1980 ) . This stringent and rather forbidding set of demands succeeded in bringing into being and sustaining a very powerful cognitive system , one qualitatively not just quantitatively different from all rivals and predecessors ; one which was to make possible industrialization , secularization , affluence and liberation , which changed the character of life in society and of man 's image of himself . current social thought is not in terms of transition as such , but of a specific transition : industrialisation ( including , of course , modernisation of agriculture ) . . . . The most important thing about this transition is that it is one-way : beetle into man , but never man into beetle . To this extent , a non-differentiating relativism , extended to all paths as well as all positions , embracing all directions under an equalising cloak , simply can not apply nowadays . . . societies can choose industrialism from a pre-industrial situation ( and generally do when they have the choice ) but not vice versa . . . . We may view traditional societies with nostalgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolted by their cruelty . It does n't matter : they no longer present a viable alternative . . . . In other words , // we are here in the rather fortunate , and rather unusual , situation of knowing with practical certainty both that something will happen ( though not just when and how ) and that it is good . ( Gellner 1964 , pp. 68  --  9 ) The picture this suggests is that our rationality leads us to take over from blind evolutionary mutations the problem of survival . Survival means food , water , shelter , protection from enemies , including disease . It means getting control over nature . Once this process has begun , other problems quickly surface to keep us busy , such as getting comfortable , having a high standard of living and so on . Nations and persons these days are not content to survive , they want to prosper . This seems to me eminently rational . Goal-directed action , problem-solving  --  rationality , in short  --  has given us the means to solve other problems than survival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rational and moral unity of mankind becomes apparent at this stage . The rationality manifests itself in communication and discussion about problems . The moral unity manifests itself in the selection of problems and the urgency given to them . Often enough any two given scientists will disagree on how a problem is to be solved ; but they will agree to , and their rational unity transpires from , work on the problem . Similarly , often two moralists will disagree on what are the correct or best moral rules , but that they are needed and must be discussed they agree . Here is their unity . Underlying a remark I made earlier about relativism having reasons behind it which we ca n't dismiss out of hand was this view : that the unity of mankind does not demand monolithic agreement  --  it requires open-minded discussion of what the problems are and how to go about solving them . Open-mindedness is both a rational ( open to learning ) and a moral ( respectful ) position , indeed only in such rationality can we find our moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moralities , diverse moral ideas , are not just random collections . They are systems of rules and injunctions to live by . As such they are neither fixed nor given . They change over time and they differ from place to place , even person to person . The question is whether their changes and differences are random or systematic . My suggestion is that there is an element of system in their differences and this links up with the struggle for rationality : to learn the better to apply reason to tasks . // If the problem of morality is to devise rules for living together one may rank systems partly by how well they acknowledge this . An absolutist morality , for example , that sees morality as a question of obedience to the gods , of not committing sins  --  regardless of the degree to which this interferes with harmonious living  - -  such a morality we may consider rather poorly adapted to the task . If the only reason for enforcing a taboo is that God has spoken against it , then that is saying little in defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind is a purely secular conception of morality , just as we have a purely secular conception of cognition . This conception of morality we owe to Kant , who gave crystal clear reasons why we can not pass the buck of morality on to some authority or other , human or divine . Since it is we who accept that morality and implement it , it is we who are unable to evade the responsibility . So morality is in the end traceable to down-to-earth human beings . But I want to go much further than this and argue for the value of a secularized notion of morality because that is a rational system . Rationality , as we have discussed it in this monograph , comes down to the disposition and capacity to apply reason to tasks . The task of morality is devising rules , injunctions , prohibitions , prescriptions and so on that facilitate harmonious living in society . We may also add to the accomplishment of this task various other values besides harmony , such as individual freedom , equal moral treatment for all , minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with God 's laws or , even more dangerous , the fostering of virtue and prevention of sin . My conception of morality as a task to which we can apply reason is to view it as a means-ends matter : we set certain ends and morality tries to devise ways in which we can realize them . Thus it is indifferent at the first stage to what set of goals and values it is being devised to facilitate . This is not true of the second stage , as we shall see . As in cognition , morality can be a rational learning process . The rules are a social institution in which many persons and their rational intelligences can participate . Morality is partly personal rules , partly it is embodied in what we call laws . In devising and revising laws we operate with a number of straightforwardly rational principles . It is important that laws be internally consistent and consistent with each other . It is important that the purposes of law be stated , so that their success can be estimated and their failure noted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may work or it may lead to their clandestine manufacture and the development of a large illegal traffic . The framers can then ask whether their campaign against alcohol might // be better fought in the open . On marijuana no western country has yet had the courage to abolish prohibition ; on prostitution , some countries make it clandestine , some have it in the open , carefully regulated . This is a rational or trial-and-error approach to law-making . There is a perfect parallel with morality in general . Consider the question of honesty and of self-deception . Honesty is not merely a virtue because some religions say it is so ; indeed , there are persuasive philosophical arguments to suggest that a society which lost the basic disposition to tell the truth could not function . So honesty is a crucial matter in the smooth working of life in society . What is the best way to promote it ? Some people believe that all immorality should be heavily penalized . Sometimes this leads those who behave immorally to lie about it . They thus sin doubly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to themselves about it : consider lying in the name of their religion . We need to discuss and learn from this about the best way to foster the virtues . We also learn to rank the virtues . Is sinning worse than lying about it , or is lying the worst sin , or perhaps self-deception ? Depending on our answers to these questions we may , by practice and the instruction of our children , rely on somewhat different sets of moral rules . Note that the process described is one of learning from experience . Because moral rules have no cognitive content does not mean we can not learn anything about or from them . We can learn about their many consequences ; we can learn about their consistency with other rules , practised and proposed ; we can learn about their feasibility in practice . All this is knowledge , not of two times two equals four , or that masses attract each other with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them , but sui generis : knowledge of morals . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life in human society . What of the second level I spoke of ? Well , I emphasized in the discussion of rationality that it is a reflexive process . That is , we learn not only about the world , we also learn about learning about the world . In so far as our methodological and sociological rules facilitate or hinder learning from experience , the growth of knowledge , we try to tinker with and add to them . It is a great advance , for example , to abandon attempts to formulate rules of inductive learning from both our philosophy of science and our scientific education . It is such a difficult task that although it was clearly preached by Bacon roughly three hundred and sixty years ago , it is still far from being accomplished . Such reflexive rationality is relevant in morality too . Kant , for 110
