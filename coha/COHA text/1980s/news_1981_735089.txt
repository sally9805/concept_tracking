txt MONTREAL  --  Firings always are lousy things to watch . Bob Geary , the general manager , led Joe Scannella , his soon-tobe.former coach , from a side door of the Montreal Alouettes ' dressing room . They slunk along the dim gray corridor as if they were going to a hanging , which , of course , they were , Upstairs , Nelson Skalbania , whose fortune Includes such nice tax writeoffs as shopping malls and four hockey and soccer teams including a junior hockey club that he bought for his 20-year-old daughter , swung his legs from a desk and denied that the Alouettes , his newly purchased bauble , can not ' cover their outlandish player salary budget . " You have n't heard of us bouncing any checks , have you ? " Skalbania rasped , his brown eyes piercing the reporter who vented the bankruptcy rumor . MEANWHILE , SCANNELLA awaited the word behind Geary 's door . He had received another word six weeks earlier , a two-year contract extension . A second vote of ? confidence came three days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports now that tax gatherers run the show . The club had slumped to 1-9 even after Skalbania had raided the border for expensive talent in the way of Vince Ferragamo , James Scott , Billy " White Shoes " Johnson , David Overstreet , and Keith Gary . Like many other carpetbaggers , he thought his money would buy happiness , certainly some healthy depreciation . Now he is settling for an ulcer. only ' Before Ferragamo , et al , the Alouettes had drawn only 20,000 fans  --  anemic even for the Canadian Football League . After Skalbania finished pouring an extra. $1.5 million into their portion of the budget , the crowds rose to all of 27,000 . EVEN MORE EMBARRASSING , a team that had gone 8.8 last year without an inpouring of pricey talent now had lost eight games in a row . Obviously , something had to be done . The script called for firing the coach . Ferragamo , a bargain at $700,000 , had turned up completely without the touch that sent Los Angeles to the Super Bowl two years ago and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's prime quarterback in 1980 . By the time he was benched a week ago for the $10,000 man ho had replaced , he had dished off 19 interceptions , Two more came last Saturday after the replacement had been hurt  --  sad , Indecisive throws between and behind receivers , Scannella simply had to go . The man had taken Montreal to a pair of CFL title games in the three years before Skalbania and his accountants slithered onto the scene , but obviously did n't know how to milk superstars . WHY , SCANNELLA HAD to be at fault for Overstreet 's fumbles . The rookie running back has seen the fatter Canadian football bounce away 13 times in 10 games , and 9 of those were lost . Scannella put him through special drills to get the hang of holding on but that clearly was n't enough . Gary , too , was Scannella 's failure , Hero was a rookie from Oklahoma who probably would have spent three years learning the Steeier system before getting a ' chance to play defense . He was hired to overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 points a game . Scannella just could n't get him to do the job . Well , at least he did all right with Scott and Johnson . The Chicago and Houston veterans ? jumped among the top receiv'ers in a league featuring secondaries staffed by NFL rejects . That alone is worth about $500,000 to Skalbania . No wonder Scannella got those extra two years of pay before he was dismissed . He deserved some reward . Maybe he 's really a ? specialist who should coach receivers . It 's the North American way to garret the coach whenever things go wrong . It 's easier to drop a coach than his players . The guy who hired the coach is never fired unless he happens to be a general manager . Too bad no one ever fires the guys who hire the ' general managers . SKALBANIA IS TILE PROTOTYPE of big time sports run amok . He made his fortune in real estate and got into sports , he says , " because the market was lousy . " He can afford to . throw huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writeoff , recouped through appreciation when he finally sells the club . Thus a Ferragamo can be brought in , paid more than the finest surgeons , handed the " messiah 's " role in a foreign system , and then be expected to perform the miracles he is , paid to produce . If he can not perform , , someone ( not the guy who hired him gets it in the neck . Ferragamo sadly stood before a knot of reporters in the Alouettes ' dressing room shortly after Scannella had been summoned upstairs . He tried to explain why he can not make it in the Canadian Football League , how he can throw interceptions every game and all week in practice and still expect to play . He denied the money makes for too much pressure . He said instead that it was the fatter ball , the wider field , the fewer downs , the extra defehsive back . He just has n't been able to adjust , he said . Not for $700,000 . Not for all the money in the world . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not quitting , I 've made a commitment to this league . " It just may take a while to learn this strange game , he said , to escape a bad groove . " We all are at fault , " Ferragamo said . " No one here is on the same page . " Upstairs , Skalbania was having second thoughts about his largesse . " Obviously , it was a mistake . " he said . " We are paying players 100 to 150 per cent more than the top three . teams in our league . Maybe we 'll have to start doing what the others are doing . " Behind him , Scannella waited beyond Geary 's door . After admitting his mistake , Skalbania did the only thing the system expects of him . He got rid of the coach .
