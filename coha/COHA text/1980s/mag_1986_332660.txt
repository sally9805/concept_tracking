The raids were well coordinated . One evening in June , 50 Brazilian federal agents in the southern state of Santa Catarina simultaneously swept down on the home of Lawyer Carlos Cesario Pereira , 40 , a maternity hospital and a number of clandestine nurseries . Police recovered 20 children ranging in age from newborns to 3-year-olds , arrested seven suspects and detained 22 Israeli couples who were seeking to adopt children . The Israelis were later released because they apparently did not realize that the adoption proceedings might be illegal . Police claimed that Cesario was involved in the illegal adoption of Brazilian children by foreign couples , primarily Israelis . <P> Cesario and two of his associates are suspected of trafficking in minors to obtain a profit . Although lawyers like Cesario routinely help foreigners expedite adoption proceedings , arranging adoptions for profit has been illegal in Brazil since November 1984 . Cesario has admitted that he handled 150 adoptions at an average price of $5,000 a child , ten times what an attorney would normally charge for the paperwork involved in the process . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he was simply providing a humanitarian service . A federal prosecutor is reviewing evidence to determine what charges may be brought against Cesario . <P> Brazil has an abundance of abandoned children , including an estimated 300,000 who live in the streets . Most , however , are dark-skinned , and foreign couples generally prefer fairer babies . As a result , light-skinned infants are at a premium for would-be adoptive parents and unscrupulous operators alike . Cesario 's special rapport with Israelis began in 1982 when he helped one couple with an adoption . Others later learned of him by word of mouth . According to police , Cesario ran a highly sophisticated operation out of a town near the port of Itajai . The region has a large population of German descent , which accounts for the abundance of light-skinned infants . Police claim that about 60 people worked for him , including doctors , nurses , baby- sitters , court officials , notaries and drivers . In addition , women he hired allegedly masqueraded as social workers to persuade poor women to give up their babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each infant procured . Rosi Jorje , 18 , says she met a " social worker " last October when she was six months pregnant . Since the father of her baby , a sailor , had disappeared , she accepted the woman 's help . In exchange for medical care , Jorje promised to give up her baby when it was born . " The social worker told me if I decided I still wanted to keep the baby , that would be all right too , " she explains . " When Daniela was born , I said I wanted to keep her . The social worker said , ' That 's too bad , ' and took her from me . " She never saw her baby again . <P> Members of Cesario 's group met prospective parents at the Itajai airport and escorted them to his luxurious farmhouse , where they were permitted to spend time with several babies available for adoption . Once a couple had selected a child , adoption papers , possibly obtained under illegal circumstances , were provided . " Cesario took advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners who would pay anything for a baby , " said Alcioni de Santana , the federal police superintendent in Itajai . " There is trafficking in babies everywhere in Brazil , but I 've never seen anything like this . "
