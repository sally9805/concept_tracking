This flat market for homes contrasts sharply with the region ' s real estate boom from 1983 to mid-1987 , when the prices of houses , condominiums and cooperative apartments more than doubled. // But surveys in the last 12 months show that price increases in the region have averaged 4. 9 percent , only slightly higher than the 4. 5 percent overall rate of inflation in the area. // While the flat market is a disappointment for people trying to sell their homes , the experts say , it is good news for a region where economic growth is threatened by a shortage of affordable housing . Many companies , in New York City and its suburbs alike , have slowed their expansion because their employees can not buy homes within commuting distance. // The leveling off is a result of a combination of factors , most notably layoffs on Wall Street , slower expansion by many suburban companies and the simple fact that the cost of homes in the region has soared far beyond the reach of many potential buyers. // Rapid price increases also appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northeast , particularly in the Boston area . But the slowdown is not nationwide ; prices are surging in California , where they are higher in some areas than in New York. // Experts in the New York area say some homeowners could be hurt if prices do not increase , or , worse , if they decline , as some predict . Indeed , the experts say that if some people who bought their homes at the peak of the region ' s boom in 1986 and 1987 were forced to sell today , they would not receive prices high enough to compensate them for their original investment plus the fees of lawyers and brokers and other costs associated with buying and selling real estate . <> <> ' Not an Easy Time ' to Sell // " This is not an easy time to be selling a house , " said Barbara Field , a travel agent who sold a four-bedroom , three-bathroom house in Stamford , Conn. , in late July for $407 , 500 . The asking price two months earlier was $459 , 000. // Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The market is terrible , " said Carl Peek , a real estate agent who specializes in apartments and brownstones in Brooklyn Heights , Cobble Hill , Carroll Gardens and other Brooklyn neighborhoods that have been attracting buyers who work on Wall Street. // " We ' ve got a whole generation of buyers going into culture shock , " he added . " These are people who assumed things could only go up , up , up , and now they are realizing they can go down. " // Throughout the region , the number of homes listed for sale is far higher than in previous years . Multiple listing services in the region reported this week that there were 7 , 093 homes for sale in Nassau County , L.I. , up from 4 , 706 a year ago , and 5 , 600 homes for sale in Bergen County , N.J. , up from 4 , 000 a year ago , In Stamford , there are 700 homes on the market , up from 500 a year ago , according to the city ' s Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City and the prices they are fetching are impossible to measure because no multiple listing service exists and prices are not reported to the city. // One real estate company , the Corcoran Group , which surveys its own clients in expensive high-rise buildings on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side , said the asking price per room had increased from $96 , 157 in January to $115 , 365 in July. // Nonetheless , the gap between prices asked and prices received is apparently growing . " Ninety percent of the Manhattan market is flat , " said Charles Urstadt , a partner in Pearce , Urstadt , Mayer and Greer , a Manhattan real estate concern. // While price increases have also slowed sharply in most of the Northeast , particularly in the Boston metropolitan area , two cities , Hartford and Buffalo , have defied the trend . Prices have been rising rapidly there this year. // In California , home prices in the 1980 ' s have appeared to move in direct opposition to those in the New York and Boston areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s , is surging , with prices increasing by tens of thousands of dollars each month. // Experts differ on the future course of prices , both in the New York area and in the nation as a whole . One extreme view is offered by Comstock Partners Inc. , a Wall Street money management firm , which last week predicted in a prominently displayed article in Barron ' s , a weekly newspaper for investors , that home prices would collapse , and the crash would be most severe in the New York area. // In an interview , Comstock ' s president , Michael Aronstein , said home prices in the New York area might fall 50 percent over the next 10 years . He said the collapse could occur because people have taken on too much debt to pay off their mortgages , many have come to consider their homes as speculative investments , and a sudden slowdown would lead to a wave of panic selling. // Economists dismissed the forecast , saying it does not take into account the emotional attachment Americans have to their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City , where the vacancy rate in apartments - both rentals and cooperatives - is 2. 5 percent . <> <> Higher Inflation Seen Later // Most experts said that they expected home prices to resume in the 1990 ' s a rate of increase that would exceed the overall rate of inflation by a margin wider than that being experienced now , but that the New York region ' s boom would not be repeated. // " People ' s homes are not something they treat like stocks and bonds , " said Kenneth Rosen , chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley and manager of real estate research for Salomon Brothers Inc . He said the Comstock forecast was " fear mongering. " // Other experts said there have been periods when the value of homes has declined temporarily . In New York City , prices for cooperative apartments plummeted , in some cases by more than 20 percent , between 1970 and 1975 , the period leading up to the city ' s financial crisis. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City was a reflection of broader problems in the region , although far less severe than those of the early 1970 ' s . With 15 , 000 layoffs on Wall Street since the stock market crash last October , and with thousands losing their jobs at banks , department stores , advertising agencies and other businesses , many homes are being put on the market . <> <> The Affordability Problem // A more fundamental problem , the economists said , is that few New York area residents who do not already own homes can afford to buy them . One analysis by the Federal Home Loan Bank found that the median price of a home in the region had more than doubled between the beginning of 1983 and the spring of 1988 , to $192 , 000 , even though the average family income in the region had increased by slightly under 27 percent in the same period , to $41 , 700. // Rae D. Rosen , an economist with the Federal Home Loan Bank , said that a family making the average amount of money would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify for a mortgage to buy the median-priced home , even if the family had enough cash for a 20 percent down payment. // And while the figures in this affordability index have improved slightly over the last 12 months because the rise in home prices has slowed , she said , the situation is still far different from that of the nation as a whole , where people making the average income have more than enough to qualify for mortgages on the median-priced home , providing they have the down payment . <> <> Why Slowdown Is Expected // Such analysis has convinced economists , real estate brokers and many potential buyers that a slowdown in price increases , or even a slight decline , is necessary to allow the gap between incomes and prices to narrow. // " At this point , it would be unrealistic to expect that some prices won ' t come down , " said Jim Merrion , senior vice president of Coldwell Banker , who manages the real estate brokerage ' s Northeastern operations. // Ms. Rosen , meanwhile , said she expected prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York area until 1990 . If inflation remains at its present level , that would mean a certain decline in home values. //
