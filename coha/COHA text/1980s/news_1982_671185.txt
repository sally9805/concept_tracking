With only a soft crunch , a 1 , 500-ton Weingartner press transforms a sheet of steel into the recognizable shape of a car door . Mechanical hands wisk it away onto the production line where 150 robot-welding machines , swaying and snapping like giant praying mantises , gradually build it into another Corsa , General Motors ' belated competitor for a share in Europe ' s important small-car market. // The scene is G.M. ' s new plant near Saragossa in the north of Spain . The nearly $2 billion facility , opened only last month by King Juan Carlos I , is the most modern and highly automated ever built by the company . <> <> An Underdeveloped Market // The factory and the Corsa automobile it builds represent G.M. ' s bid for a slice of what is regarded in the industry as Europe ' s last , though increasingly competitive , underdeveloped car market . But it is also another example of how small-car manufacturing in Europe is migrating south into Spain and Portugal , both low-wage countries hoping soon to join the Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer countries of northern Europe. // " It ' s the combination that counts - good Spanish prospects plus proximity to other potential small-car markets in Europe , " said Ferdinand Beickler , managing director of Adam Opel A.G. , the Frankfurt-based German automobile maker bought by G.M. in the 1920 ' s . It runs the American company ' s operations in Europe. // " We could no longer afford to be out of the small-car market , " Mr. Beickler said , noting that it represents 33 percent of the car market in Spain , 44 percent in Italy , 32 percent in France , 25 percent in Britain and 51 percent in Portugal. // " A geographical polarization " is taking place in Europe ' s car industry , said a recent study by D.R.I.-Europe , the London-based economic research group . Spain and Portugal , according to the study , will increasingly monopolize cheap , small-car production while more expensive autos will tend to be made in Germany and Sweden . " Producers caught between these two centers of strength " - Britain and France - " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> Large Import Tariff // Part of the reason for the migration of auto makers to Spain is that the Spanish auto market has long been protected by a prohibitive 36 percent import tariff , forcing manufacturers to build their cars locally. // Renault , Citroen , and Talbot ( Chrysler ' s former European arm , now , like Citroen , owned by France ' s Peugeot group ) have been established in Spain for years . So had Fiat until it pulled out of its joint venture with SEAT , the Government-owned Spanish auto maker . Volkswagen has recently become the Government ' s new partner in SEAT. // In 1976 , Ford opened a plant in Valencia that will produce 200 , 000 small Fiestas this year and 100 , 000 slightly larger Escorts . In Portugal , where Renault is installed , Ford has recently signed a letter of intent to build up to 200 , 000 cars a year. // Spain is still drawing auto makers because of its low car ownership ratio of only 212 per 1 , 000 people , well below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per 1 , 000 , highest in Europe , and France , Italy and Britain have more than 300 per 1 , 000 . <> <> Exports Stressed // Aside from the market in Spain , Ford and G.M. are counting on exporting cars made there to the rest of Europe . And the Spanish Government , in fact , requires them to export at least 66 percent of total production. // Both Ford and G.M. play down low Spanish wages and the prospect of Common Market membership as reasons for moving into Spain . " We ' re investing in machines , not workers , " said G.M. ' s Mr. Beickler . Patrick P. Byrne , Ford ' s managing director in Spain , said the Valencia plant was already " exporting profitably into Europe " over the Common Market ' s low 4. 6 percent external tariff. // Nevertheless , at a time of deepening recession and with each company having 9 , 000 workers on the payroll , Ford and G.M. executives concede privately that every small advantage helps . Currently , G.M. ' s chief European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total European car demand , from 9. 9 million this year to 10 million next year and 10. 5 million in 1984. // Spanish membership in the Common Market would also be particularly useful for G.M. Unlike Ford , it does not import many parts from Britain for its Spanish-built cars , although it hopes to sell the Corsa on the British market . As a result , British trade unions are threatening to oppose the Corsa . <> <> British Protest // Meanwhile , the British Government has protested that Spain ' s high tariff stops British manufacturers from selling cars to Spain while Spanish auto makers have virtually free access to the British market. // But problems are now starting to crowd in on Spain ' s foreign auto makers . French foot-dragging makes it unlikely that Spain will join the Common Market before 1986 or 1987. // In addition , the long-predicted boom in the Spanish car market has failed to materialize . Although Spaniards bought 700 , 000 new cars in 1977 , they will buy only 500 , 000 this year . And the market is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we set up here we thought the market would be one million cars by now , " Ford ' s Mr. Byrne said. // Ford , which has 16 percent of the Spanish market , reported aftertax profits equivalent to $51 million last year and will do as well this year . But after that it will face increasing competition from G.M. ' s new plant . Renault , with 34 percent of the Spanish market , had earnings of $20 million last year. // SEAT , however , with 24 percent of the market , is chronically in deficit and lost $158 million last year . Although its capacity is 400 , 000 cars a year , it currently builds only 300 , 000 - the same as Ford , but with triple the work force . Citroen , which has 10. 5 percent of the market , lost $3. 1 million last year. //
