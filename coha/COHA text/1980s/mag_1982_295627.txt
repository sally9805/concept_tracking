In a key arms address , the President proposes a controversial basing plan <P> His delivery was flawless , his tone somber , his message meant to be reassuring . " Our children should not grow up frightened , " Ronald Reagan said . " They should not fear the future . " But the President 's approach to preventing nuclear war was of itself , and necessarily , a frightening thing : he urged deployment of 100 huge new MX intercontinental ballistics missiles in a Dense Pack cluster near Cheyenne , Wyo . <P> " It is sadly ironic , " Reagan said , " that in these modern times it still takes weapons to prevent war . I wish it did not . " <P> Reagan 's decision on the MX amounted to a broad statement of Administration nuclear-weapons policy . Said he : " I intend to search for peace along two parallel paths-deterrence and arms reductions . " Reagan described U.S. military vulnerabilities in the most sweeping terms he has used to date , declaring : " In virtually every measure of military power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no certain deterrence against a possible Soviet attack in such a state of imbalance , he suggested , and no incentive for the Kremlin to agree to arms reductions . The Reagan policy , in short : to rearm America so that steps toward nuclear disarmament will become possible . <P> Whether the Administration can realize its goal of a vastly strengthened military depends largely on Congress . The decision to go ahead with the $26 billion MX system is certain to provoke stormy debate among the lawmakers , who are sensitive to growing public uneasiness about nuclear arms and the Administration 's increased defense spending . The outcome of the argument , which may begin this week , could profoundly affect arms negotiations between the two superpowers , the economies of both nations , perhaps even the chances of a nuclear war . <P> To drive home his plea for the MX , and indirectly for more defense spending in general , Reagan used electronic graphs that showed-simplistically , and some experts say misleadingly-the red line of Soviet military might darting far beyond the U.S. blue . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Viet Nam War , it dropped sharply to $116 billion in 1976 , and has recovered to just $195 billion this year . Soviet defense funding , by contrast , increased steadily from $137 billion in 1962 to $275 billion in 1982 . Two decades ago the U.S. had 3,090 strategic missiles and bombers , the U.S.S.R. a mere 510 ; now the Soviets have a lead , 2,498 to 1,918 . More than 200 long-range Backfire bombers have joined Soviet strategic forces , while the U.S. still relies on its aging B-52 fleet . " Many of our B-52 bombers are now older than the pilots who fly them , " Reagan noted .
