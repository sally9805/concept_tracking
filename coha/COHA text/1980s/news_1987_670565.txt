We already know that October is an exciting month for individual Broadway and Off Broadway productions , but it ' s also the month when theater companies get into gear . Take , for example , the WPA Theater , where early birds saw " Steel Magnolias . " The initial offering , Oct. 13 , will be the almost silver anniversary revival of Tennessee Williams ' s " Milk Train Doesn ' t Stop Here Anymore " in its original version . Elizabeth Ashley , returning to the stage after a long hiatus , will play the wealthy widow dictating her memoirs. // A few blocks away , at the Hudson Guild , Israel Horovitz ' s latest play , about an amateur production of Ibsen ' s " Wild Duck , " is scheduled to debut Oct. 7 . It ' s called - what else ? - " The Year of the Duck , " and will be followed by productions of " In Perpetuity Throughout the Universe , " by Eric Overmeyer ; " Cock-Ups , " by Simon Moss , and " Redlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ware .

The address is 519 West 23d Street ( 206-0523 ) . // // Australian Import // The Australian playwright Daniel Keene had several short works produced here last year and his latest , a full-length drama called " Isle of Swans , " is to open Oct. 15 . But the real news is that the play will both star and be directed by Rhonda Wilson , who will have the distinction of making some sort of theatrical history .

No , it can ' t be. // But it is , and it ' s a feat made possible because Ms. Newman is in only one scene - which takes place halfway through the first act . After that , there ' s still another 100 minutes before the cast takes its curtain calls. // " All the doormen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newman , explaining that she left the theater because " when you ' re revved up , you can only do so much reading and writing before the walls close in on you. " // The writing , started several years ago , will be a personal history - " not a memoir " - based on one event in her life , and she ' s not giving a clue as to what that event is . As yet untitled , it ' s scheduled for publication next year by Simon &; Schuster , she said. // But back to the strolling : She always allows adequate time after returning to the theater to get back in the right mood before the curtain calls. // " It ' s a very odd feeling because the family has been together all night and I come in for the bow , " she said . " And also because even in my one scene , I ' m an interloper. " // But the interloping " Aunt Blanche " was nominated for a Tony Award this year , a quarter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleeping.

" <> <> Delta Vignettes // A glance at the background material on Endesha Ida Mae Holland would indicate that the story of her life could encompass several plays - but the one that will have its New York premiere next month , presented by the New Federal Theater , is " From the Mississippi Delta . " It ' s a series of vignettes tracing her coming of age and growing up black , female and poor . Her background , in a nutshell : raised in a bordello , civil rights worker , university student , playwright and winner of several awards , and currently teaching at the State University at Buffalo .
