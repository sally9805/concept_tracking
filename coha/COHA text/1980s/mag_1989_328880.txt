Few issues touch as deep a nerve in the nation 's psyche as questions surrounding capital punishment . Thus reaction across the country last week was swift and in some quarters downright horrified when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that crimes by some juveniles and mentally retarded people may be punishable by death . By a 5-to-4 vote , the high court ruled in a pair of decisions that the constitutional ban on " cruel and unusual punishments " does not forbid the execution of youths who commit crimes at 16 or 17 years of age , nor does it automatically prohibit death sentences for the retarded . " By executing the retarded and people who are n't old enough to vote or serve in &; the Army , " said Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz , " we 're doing something barbarous : executing the least culpable people on death row . " <P> The dramatic decisions were written by Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor , who were joined by Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice William Rehnquist . The rulings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " exact form " of the Miranda warnings to inform arrested suspects of their rights , left little doubt that the court 's tough law-and-order majority is firmly entrenched . " The days of criminals ' getting off on technicalities are over , " declared Daniel Popeo , head of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation , surveying the overall rightward drift of the Rehnquist Court 's criminal jurisprudence this year . <P> The capital-punishment cases focused new attention on some of the 2,200 convicts on death row , 31 of whom committed their crimes as juveniles and as many as 30% of whom may be retarded or mentally impaired . While liberal activists fumed at the rulings , conservative legal experts and law-enforcement officials gave strong approval . Commented Phil Caruso , president of New York City 's Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association : " These are sound decisions , in keeping with what 's happening on our streets today . We 're talking about teenagers who have reached the age of intellectual maturity , who can distinguish right from wrong and who have committed heinous acts of premeditated , deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a nationwide poll conducted for TIME and CNN last week , those responding expressed strong disapproval of the death penalty for the retarded , although a majority supported executing teenagers . <P> The ruling on 16- and 17-year-olds grew out of murder cases against Kevin Stanford of Kentucky and Heath Wilkins of Missouri . Stanford was 17 in 1981 when he held up a gas station , then sodomized a female attendant and shot her in the head at point-blank range . At 16 Wilkins repeatedly stabbed a woman owner of a convenience store in the neck and chest during a 1985 robbery . Justice Scalia emphasized that the constitutionality of sentencing 16- and 17- year-olds to death depends on the " evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society . " Applying that standard with chilly mathematical precision , Scalia calculated that of the 37 states now permitting capital punishment , only twelve prohibit a death sentence for offenders under 18 , and three others forbid it for those under 17 . " This does not establish the degree of national consensus this Court has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual , " he concluded .
