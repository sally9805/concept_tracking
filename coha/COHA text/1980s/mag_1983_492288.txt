// Eric Sloane is an artist of notable gifts , who also has in him  --  in proportions that are in constant flux  --  generous streaks of poet , grizzly bear , philosopher , child , lover , farmer and guru . If we take Henry Thoreau , Wins  --  low Homer , Robert Frost and Huck Finn and stir well , we may not have exactly Eric , because he is unique , but we 'll have something of an idea . If that seems a bit high-flown , please ponder the following : At Eric 's country home in Warren , Connecticut , his personal bathroom is papered with the originals of lath-century newspapers and almanacs worth a pretty penny . It is also festooned with awards and memorabilia , which he prefers to display privately rather than publicly . Among these is a raffish holograph of Eric and his buddy immy Cagney . They are duded up for the picture like a couple of old-time Mississippi riverboat gamblers , and they look so lethal and comfortable in their getups that one can not help suspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that role all the time . On the other hand , at Eric 's elegant hacienda in Taos , New Mexico , there hangs in his private bathroom a " Dear Eric " kind of letter from that great admirer of American culture , the late Leonid Brezhnev . It thanks Eric for the tri  --  umphant visit he and his wife , Mimi , made in the fall of 1974 to Russia , bringing with them a collection of 36 large Sloane paintings for a Moscow showing entitled " I Remember America . " The exhibit , at the U.S.S.R. Academy of the Arts , drew crowds of Russians and lasted three weeks . Eric recalls that the " Russians were surprised to know that the Americans had farms . " ( / Remember America is also the title of a handsome " cocktail table " book of Sloane paintings and writings that was published in 1971 and reissued again in 1975 , following his Russian tour de force . Eric himself is not overly impressed by all of this . He has written and illustrated more than 30 books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life rhythms . ) Just the same , the Brezhnev response was unusual . Brezhnev was usually able to keep his enthusiasm for the United States under control , and Eric 's theme of the America he loves is unabashedly patriotic . These are intriguing clues to the frolic Eric Sloane has made of his busy 70-odd years . These days , there are moments when he seems to drop away into another world of thought . I suspect that Eric 's years may have something to do with this . He is a rugged , handsome type ( " The women go more for mama 's boys these days " ) , and I think that he is in an interim period of his chronology , when he is old enough to be glum about his age from time to time and still not quite old enough to boast about it . But the song is far from over . New plaudits are ringing for the soaring mural , 75 feet across and 56 feet six inches in height ( " seven stories high and a half a block long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. Taken purely as a physical achieve  --  ment , it is a monument to any man 's creative energies and sheer muscular power . Eric had n't even wanted to take on the assignment at first . He 's afraid of heights . He did n't like the idea of climbing around on all the ladders and scaffolding such a project would require . Almost too polite to turn down the job , as he tells it , Eric allowed the museum to send an emissary to visit him so that he might decline in a courteous and thoughtful manner . But the museum outfoxed him . When Eric took his guest for a luncheon at the famous Dutch Treat Club in New York City , it became clear in the midst of . the camaraderie of that special imagine a man looking at the sky and denying God . " You must come with me to Kent , Connecticut , however , to discover the quixotic way in which this man of the skies is of the earth also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own personality . For here we find one of the most hauntingly seductive little museums in all the world  --  the Sloane-Stanley Museum on the banks of the Housatonic River . We meet Eric at his hilltop house first , before going on to the museum itself . Here , on his 30 acres of woodland , is a country man by choice , a rugged figure with a face lined by outdoor living and indoor thinking , looking down on the river valley from about 1,200 feet , maybe ten miles north of Kent and a hound-dog 's bay from Cornwall Bridge , the old covered relic treasured by the kayakers and canoeists who search for white water on the Housatonic . We step into Eric 's home , built int() the hillside , and momentarily we forget about the museum  --  because this , too , is an unfor  --  gettable museum of rural America in its own right . " I 'm the only boy on the block who has a wooden plow on his living room table as a work of pure decorative art , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patina of the seasons , and his huge living room , set into a not-that big kind of country house , holds the historic shape of the great wooden earthmover in its center as corn 100 Long Livers continued from page 55 " Tornado ! " I yelled , jamming on the brakes . " Head for the ditch ! " To my surprise , that is exactly what she did . Unfortunately , two days of rain had beaten us to it . But when one 's life is up for grabs , what 's a little belly flop into that gunk ? Ten minutes later , with no action except from you-know-who , I decid  --  ed to risk just my head by standing up and peering over the bank . The clouds had by this time lifted a cou  --  ple of feet , and I was able to dis  --  tinguish the funnel cloud as the Mt . Pleasant water tower . A late-model wife , of course , would have slogged her way out of the ditch , floundered back to the car , picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver able to distinguish her from a mud statue . Happily , to broken-in models such as mine , incidents such as these serve only as barnacles  --  if you will excuse this change of metaphor  --  which , over the years , have formed the great barrier reef that protects yesterday 's marriages from today 's incompati  --  bilities . In other words , long-livers come from marriages that can rise up out of a ditch muddy but unbowed , so to speak . In fact , 1 held her hand all the way to the car . A woman ca n't stran  --  gle a man with only one hand . A Eric Sloane continued from page 69 stand in , and as deep as a cave . Carved on the mantel , a monolith of one enormous log , is the legend : " The providence of God is my in  --  heritance . " Above that ( philosophy with a smile ) are 14 antique hour  --  glasses in many sizes . Eric paints and writes within this room . There are 700 ( count ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 30-odd books Eric has written and illustrated are hidden in a huge oak closet that must have taken six men to bring into the room . His bookshelves are laden with other authors  --  leather-bound books of antiquity , old almanacs , treatises on art and photography and the col  --  lected work of the masters . Picture windows commune with the coun  --  tryside from every angle . In Eric 's basement studio he waves with a kind of throwaway modesty at about 30 paintings he has readied for a forthcoming ex  --  hibition at the Museum of the Southwest in Midland , Texas . The paintings are of the New England and Southwestern scenes , yet he has found surprising similarities in the contrasting structures of these two areas ; he calls attention to the steeples of Vermont churches mak  --  ing the same leap to the sky that is echoed in the high ladders of New Mexico Indian adobe prayer houses , where one mounts first to the roof , only then to descend to an enclosed space for spiritual uplift . I ask Eric if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing . Was it difficult borrowing them back from galleries and other museums and private owners ? Eric deadpans the answer : " Oh , no , I did n't have to do that . I just painted 30 new ones . " He goes on : " I paint very quickly , you see . Maybe I should n't admit to that , but in a certain sense , a paint  --  ing I may have taken only a couple of hours to work out has been in themaking in my mind for maybe 30 years . " I look at the paintings , and  --  as they used to say in the Rover Boys books  --  with a barely concealed smirk , I mention to Eric that 1 am very familiar with the tiny Vermont village he has painted with such af  --  fection , but I am sure there is no such mountain behind it . He wins the round and teaches me a lesson in one graceful , low-keyed reply : " I never paint on location , " he says . " 1 painted that here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any particular mountain for someone to recognize . " 1 like the painting far better with Eric 's special mountain in it than I do with its own less-memorable hill . He has made me more aware . A country man , did I say ? Eric Sloane had the good fortune to be born in New York City , which is about the best thing that could happen to anyone with a talent for painting rural scenes . A city 's gift is to drive the nature lover into ex  --  ile  --  or , rather , to create a love of nature by a denial of the coun  --  tryside . He was born in 1905 , into a fami  --  ly with no artistic leanings what  --  soever . He grew up in Forest Hills , New York , and had the good for  --  tune to have as a neighbor Frederic William Goudy , one of the great typographic designers of all time . The boy ( whose name was then Everard Jean Hinrichs ) , completely captivated by the magic Goudy had instilled in letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ameri  --  ca as a sign painter . Not that the youngster tarried in museums or art galleries  --  he painted one sign in ten-foot letters above the roller coaster of Steeplechase Amusement Park , advertising that temple of Coney Island fun to the world and those far at sea ; he did a I , 000-foot mural for the Luna Park Ballroom , then a Steeplechase competitor . He also added to the decor of the Half-Moon Hotel at Coney Island , fa  --  mous in the lore of honeymooners and gang warfare in New York . Floyd Bennett Field , the major Eastern airport of that era , hap  --  pened to be nearby , frequented by the likes of Wiley Post and Charles Lindbergh . Post took the youngster up in his plane and showed him the continued on following page fabulous world of the sky . Soon enough , the young artist turned out his first " cloudscape . " A lady who herself had a passing interest in clouds bought it immediately . Her name was Amelia Earhart . His sign-painting days beginning to fade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine Arts , and then joined the New York Art Stu  --  dents League . With his lifetime penchant for falling in with the right people , he came under the sway of John Sloan at the League  --  a mo  --  ment of truth . Sloan was then the leading light of the Ashcan School , which merely meant that this group was moving its art out of the studio and onto the city streets , not that its subject matter was garbage . The youngster was so inspired by his new artistic mentor that he took unto himself the name " Sloan , " merely adding an " e " to make the theft less direct . He also created his own given name of Eric by taking a word he loved after his own coast-to-coast travels ? " America " ? and simply deleting the first two letters and the final " a . " As I have suggested , Sloane is a complex personality . He can say , on the one hand , about his reaction to an old barn : " Although they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oversized beams made themselves felt , almost like some thing alive in the darkness . The in cense of seasoned wood and the per  --  fume of dry hay mingled to create that distinctive fragrance that only an ancient barn possesses . I felt a strong affinity with the man who built this barn . " And when he dis  --  covered in the plastered foundation the imprint of the builder 's hand : " Every line , callus and scar was there , and as I placed my hand into the imprint to compare sizes , I had the strange feeling of the past reaching down through the years to touch me . " Yet the same man says : " I am known as a painter of nostalgia  --  which I detest . I use old buildings to portray the wisdom and taste of yesterday . . . . Nostalgia is a dis  --  ease . Age will do to you exactly what it does to a dead fish . " Eric had answered all my ques  --  tions generously . But he had not yet offered anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This could embarrass you , " he said softly , " but I hope it will not . Things have usually happened in my life in threes . And as I look back , I see my whole career in three parts . The first was when I painted for discovery . Second came the time when I painted for recognition and fame . " Pause . " And now , " said Eric Sloane , " I paint for God . " After parting , as Eric drove away , I noticed his license plate . It was in letters , without any numbers on it . And the letters spelled : " Skies . " Vi
