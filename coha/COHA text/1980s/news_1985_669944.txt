SAN FRANCISCO  --  Sir James Goldsmith ' s $42. 50-a-share , or $807. 5 million , offer for as many as 19 million shares of Crown Zellerbach Corp. is an opening gambit , with the price likely to go higher during a proxy fight for the forest-products concern . Industry analysts believe that is how events will unfold in the latest takeover saga between the Anglo-French financier and the 115-year-old San Francisco company that has vowed to resist his advances . Its board met yesterday to ponder the company ' s next step . A spokesman said the concern " has nothing to report . We will be making a statement at an appropriate time . " As previously reported , Sir James ' s latest offer seeks to acquire control of Crown Zellerbach and elect new directors . Sir James now owns more than 8. 6% of the company ' s 27. 2 million shares , and , if he buys 19 million more , he would own about 78. 4% of the stock . His offer , which is scheduled to expire May 7 unless extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendered and on acquiring sufficient financing , part of which would come from a foreign private placement of securities of one of his Cayman Islands companies . The millionaire investor had earlier threatened to begin a proxy battle for a seat on Crown Zellerbach ' s 13-member board unless the company drops an anti-takeover measure it adopted last year . In an unfriendly takeover , that provision allows holders to buy two shares of the surviving entity for the price of one . Those rights won ' t be exercisable until someone acquires 20% of the company ' s common or makes an offer for 30% or more of all the shares outstanding . It wasn ' t clear if the anti-takeover measure became effective with Sir James ' s bid . Sir James ' s offer is calculated with an eye to Crown Zellerbach ' s " poison-pill " defense . The offer for 19 million shares at $42. 50 each is in effect a bid for the entire company , with a second-step merger occurring for the remaining shares at the same price . But if the company doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tender of at least 14 million shares is an attempt to reserve the right to buy 51% of the stock without assigning a specific price per share . His offer stated that if the company doesn ' t redeem the anti-takeover rights , he can change the price and other terms of the offer " in any respect . " Several analysts suggest the stakes will be raised in the takeover effort . " An eventual buyout will be in the $50 to $55 range , " said Mark Rogers , first vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . " If Crown appears to be losing the ( proxy ) battle , it ' s likely a white knight could be found at a price above $42. 50 . " Added Lawrence A. Ross of PaineWebber Inc . , " Based on book value and real-world values , plus earning power , a price in the $45 to $47 ( per share ) range is a price at which a buyer and seller could come together . " Sir James ' s announcement of his takeover bid indicated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominees on the company ' s board at its May 9 meeting , which will be two days after the expiration of his tender offer . This appears to indicate he may seek control of the company regardless of the outcome of his tender offer . It remains unclear whether Sir James is pursuing the company for its timberland or to acquire its mills and other wood-products operations . After he acquired Diamond International Corp. a few years ago , he sold off plants and equipment for a profit while keeping the timberland . Prices for western timberland , where Crown Zellerbach has much of its forest acreage , currently are depressed . Georgia Pacific Corp. recently sold a parcel of Oregon timberland for less than $500 an acre , which analysts consider low . " He ( Sir James ) may have a hidden agenda , but to activate it he has to appear to be credible and want the whole company , " said one wood-products analyst . In 1984 , Crown Zellerbach earned $86. 9 million , or $2. 61 a share , on sales of $3. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 million for projected losses on timber-cutting contracts . Since Sir James first showed interest in the company , its stock price has risen in New York Stock Exchange composite trading to yesterday ' s closing price of $41. 875 a share from $28. 75 on Dec. 12  --  the day before he said he intended to purchase as much as 25% of the company ' s common .
