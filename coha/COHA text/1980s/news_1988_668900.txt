It ' s time for a little geography trivia . What American city is famous for the intersection known as the " Four Corners of Law , " so named for the government buildings located there ? Washington , D.C. No . Here are some more clues . It is known as the " Holy City " because of its many historic churches . It was the site of America ' s first major victory in the Revolutionary War and of its first public library . Boston . Wrong again , as one glimpse of French-style ironwork and lush tropical vegetation would have told you . New Orleans . Sorry , the city in question is Charleston , S.C. Surprised ? So was I when I visited Charleston several weeks ago . I had been advised of the many exquisite gardens that are in full bloom by the end of March . And as a Civil War buff , I was fully primed for a visit to Ft . Sumter . But I was unprepared for the beauty , charm and cultural variety of this historic seaport of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s distinctive identity is its maritime location . The city is on a peninsula around which flow the Ashley and Cooper Rivers . According to Charlestonians , the Ashley and Cooper come together at the tip of their city to form the Atlantic Ocean , a slight , if understandable , exaggeration . What the rivers do form is Charleston ' s Harbor , one of the finest on the Eastern seaboard of the United States . It was this splendid anchorage and the broad rivers leading inland that attracted the first English colonists in 1670 . A decade later , the settlement of Charleston was built . A cramped , walled town subject to devastating fires , tropical fevers and British attacks during the Revolution , Charleston survived a turbulent infancy to become one of America ' s wealthiest and most cosmopolitan cities . Charleston retained its luster until the end of the Civil War , or the War of Southern Independence , as it is still referred to in some local circles . The legacy of that war is very much in evidence , especially at Ft . Sumter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sandbar at the mouth of Charleston Harbor , Ft . Sumter was claimed by North and South alike . The resulting firing on the fort on April 12 , 1861 , which was watched by enthusiastic Charlestonians from their rooftops , sparked the war that was to curtail Charleston ' s grandeur . Ft . Sumter is staffed by the U.S. Park Service and visited by tour boat several times each day . Tours of the fort last only an hour , so there is not much time to dawdle . An excellent museum and knowledgeable guide somewhat rectify this problem , but history-minded visitors are cautioned to take the earliest tour . Later in the day , invading battalions of school children swarm over the crumbling brick bastion . If Ft . Sumter is the most famous of Charleston ' s historic structures , the most popular is the Public Market . A brick-walled arcade of shops and stalls several blocks long , it is a bustling mecca of craftsmen , hucksters and curio sellers . Especially noteworthy are the Flower Ladies . These gifted women weave baskets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from West Africa . The baskets are one of the most distinctive and durable of Charleston souvenirs . The market is the terminal for several carriage tour companies whose horse and mule-drawn vehicles wend their way through the streets of the historic district . Carriage tours last an hour and are the best way to become familiar with Charleston ' s past and present . The guides , licensed by the city , are well-versed in local history and have a folksy flavor to their lectures . One of the bits of Charleston folklore that our guide imparted to us was a post-Civil War expression , " Too poor to paint . Too proud to whitewash . " This referred to the poverty that many of Charleston ' s old families suffered after the war . But what was a tragedy then has worked to Charleston ' s good fortune today . The postwar depression was so severe that few buildings were built or old ones demolished . Consequently , block after block of early 19th Century dwellings remain , many restored to their former glory . Charleston ' s Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of new ones in order to preserve this precious antebellum atmosphere . An impressive indicator of their success is the fact that it is automobiles , not carriages , which seem out of place on Charleston ' s streets . Among the important buildings open to the public are St. Michael ' s Episcopal Church , the oldest in the city , dating to the 1750s , and the Nathaniel Russell House , famed for its unsupported spiral staircase . The 24 , 000-square-foot Calhoun Mansion , one of the few noteworthy post- Civil War buildings , is even more impressive . It features a second-story ballroom with a covered glass skylight for dancing under the stars . The Calhoun Mansion , which is privately owned , was used as the Hazard Mansion in the TV mini-series " North and South . " Charleston is a rewarding place to visit at any time of the year . But spring is by far the best season . Beginning in late March , several local associations organize tours of private homes and gardens . The city is abloom , with incomparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a host of other blossoms . Charleston ' s streets are lined with palmettos , the state tree of South Carolina , and the old oaks in the city parks and cemeteries are draped with Spanish moss , giving them an ethereal beauty . Later in the spring , Charleston hosts the annual Spoleto Festival . This international celebration of music and dance will be held this year between May 19 and June 5 . In the 12 years of its existence , Spoleto has become the foremost cultural event of the South and hotel accommodations are often difficult to arrange . Charleston is a city that invites superlative comments . It certainly deserves them . The entire historic district has been designated a National Historic Landmark and the people of Charleston have been judged to be the friendliest in America . If there is ever a trivia question on where to find the best Southern hospitality , the answer for me will be an easy one .
