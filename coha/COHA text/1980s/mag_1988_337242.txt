" Look ! " says Private Dror , his eyes nervously scanning the street . " There are no youngsters over twelve in sight . Hell , where have they disappeared to ? " The five Israeli soldiers from the Nahal unit quickly slip down a narrow alley . Four Palestinian youths peek briefly from between two houses . Seconds later , a hailstorm of stones and metal pieces pelts the patrol . Hugging the walls , the unit breaks apart . When it reassembles , Dror , 20 , is breathless . Three masked men had hit him with rocks . " The bastards knew very well I could n't do anything to them , " he mutters to TIME 's Ron Ben-Yishai . " They know our orders . They knew I would not shoot . " <P> Tempers flare and subside along the Israeli-occupied West Bank , but life is not getting any easier for the Nahal soldiers . The unit was dispatched last month to patrol the city of Nablus and its outskirts . The soldiers have been instructed to keep main roads open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . If the group is large , they are under orders to call in a high-ranking officer . Their commander , Lieut . Colonel Yisrael , detests this assignment . " It 's against everything we teach them , " he says . " We train them to use their guns when they are attacked . Here it 's forbidden . " Here the aggressor , more often than not , is a woman , child or student . <P> The dilemma is no less uncomfortable for the local residents . Dror , who speaks Arabic fluently , asks shopkeepers why their stores are closed . Says one : " I got a telephone call reminding me that there is a commerce strike for 21 days to protest the expulsions and killings . " The call came from the Shabiba , a P.L.O.-affiliated youth group . A major instructs Dror , " Tell them to open the shops . Tell them we shall weld their doors shut and not let them open for a week . " He points to welding instruments . Ten minutes later most shops are open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my business down . " <P> Dror is not indifferent to the Arabs ' plight . " I do n't know if I could live with foreign soldiers around me , " he says . Still , this tour of duty has hardened many Israelis ' political views . " In the past I was ready to give up some of the ( ( occupied ) ) territories , " says Private Nir , 20 . " Today I think that 's impractical . " As children return to the streets , soldiers offer candy . The youngsters accept , whispering " Shalom . " For the soldiers , it is a welcome break from hostilities .
