Science <P> A record-setting mission underscores the Soviet space drive <P> Question : Why did the Soviet-trained Cuban Cosmonaut Arnaldo Mendez return from his recent trip into space with red hands ? <P> Answer : The Soviets aboard the ship were so worried about being hijacked to Cuba that they slapped his hands every time he reached for the controls . <P> That little joke is currently making the rounds at NASA headquarters in Washington , D.C. But the troubling fact is that U.S. officials have little to smile about when they look at the burgeoning Soviet space program . The faltering U.S. effort has been plagued by repeated delays of the space shuttle ( now scheduled for launch no earlier than next March ) , while the Soviets have been forging steadily onward , setting the stage for permanent occupation of space . <P> The latest evidence of Soviet ambitions comes with the return to earth of Cosmonauts Leonid Popov and Valery Ryumin from a record-breaking mark of 175 days in orbit but was 101 days longer than the stay by U.S. astronauts aboard the Skylab space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General Thomas Stafford , a former astronaut who commanded the orbital linkup with the Soviets in 1975 , the last manned American mission : " The Soviets are challenging the U.S. in space , and they are achievers . " <P> So they are . Though Salyut 6 may be smaller and more primitive than Skylab , which tumbled back to earth last year , the samovar-shaped space station has performed impressively . Launched three years ago , it weighs 20 tons , has as much room as a small dacha ( the amenities : a shower , 20 view ports , sleeping facilities for four ) , and has been occupied for 578 days , a little more than half its time aloft . The Soviets , using their new breed of Progress spacecraft-small , automated single-shot ferry ships-have repeatedly refueled and re-equipped Salyut , with a total overhaul of its inventory of more than two tons of scientific equipment . <P> Some of this gear seems to be military . Circling at an altitude of about 320 km ( 200 miles ) , Salyut provides an ideally situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Indeed , U.S. intelligence sources note that the Soviets have sent four unmanned satellites into orbit during the past three weeks , including one electronic eavesdropping vehicle . The frenzy is presumably part of their effort to keep tab on the war in the Persian Gulf . <P> <P> As important as spy-in-the-sky activity may be to the Soviet space effort , Salyut 's latest cosmonauts plainly had their hands full . In fact , they may have set a record for doing science in space . According to the Soviets , the experiments included physiological and biological stress tests , notably monitoring the skeletal changes that occur during prolonged exposure to weightlessness . The cosmonauts made extensive surveys of the earth , looking for oil deposits , checking crops and forests , and seeking untapped sources of fresh water . They cultured yeast cells and grew layers of gallium arsenide crystals , an important component of computer chips and lasers . The objective : to test the zero g environment for possible use in future space manufacturing facilities .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
