The battle over French television is now being joined in earnest . Last spring the government surveyed the terrain of existing channels , radically re- deployed its forces and accomplished the un-heard of : the world 's first transfer into private hands of a big and successful public television network . There followed a general scramble for stars , serials and exclusive sports events , with huge sums commanded from the zealous and newly placed competitors . Now all this has to be translated into what matters : ratings as a measure of advertising revenue . Not all the participants in this battle  --  two public networks , three commercial ones and a channel of pay TV ? will survive , and so the mood in the industry is a strange mixture of soap opera and skin game . But the situation in France is both part and illustration of a much more crucial struggle . With powerful satellites sent into orbit and cables spreading throughout the Continent , television , like radio , will soon know no frontiers . What is at stake is Europe 's cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does , the fact that such utter commercialization might be carried out by native masters of the media will be small consolation . France is both the laggard and the leader in this movement to privatize . Three years ago its television was still entirely public . This makes a contrast with the public/quasicommercial mix that has long characterized TV elsewhere in Europe . In Italy commercial television has been slowly invading the little screen for the past fifteen years . In Britain public and commercial have coexisted for decades , with Aunt Beeb , the BBC , so far holding its own and commercial channels subject to strict regulation . In West Germany , whose television system was set up by the British after the war , advertisers are not yet the full masters . France has , however , shown no interest in such cautious transition . The newcomer has become the trend setter , and the trend is unmistakable . The commercial tide is sweeping over Europe , public television is everywhere on the defensive , and the greedy tycoons are beginning to calculate their costs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the Socialists who put an end to public television 's monopoly . When they took over , in 1981 , France had three TV channels . The first , TF 1 , drew not quite half the total audience of around 35 million ; Antenne 2 accounted for well over a third ; and FR 3 , the smallest but with regional stations , took care of the rest . All three were financed partly by a license fee charged to each TV owner and partly by advertising , whose proportion to programming was fixed by the government . The Socialists made the Daniel Singer is The Nation 's correspondent in Europe . first breach in 1984 , when they set up Canal Plus , a national channel of pay television  --  much like subscription TV in the States  --  which can be received only with the aid of an unscrambling device . Its mixture of sports features and recent films , including occasional hard porn in the late hours , has finally proved a financial success , attracting some 2 million customers . The Socialists , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary elections of 1986 and then to hand both public and private television to its friends , Francois Mitterrand thought it clever to beat the right at its own game by creating a totally commercial channel , and placing it in hands friendly to himself . For funds he looked to the Schlumberger family  --  to Jerome Seydoux , the heir in this instance  --  and for expertise as well as funds , beyond the Alps , to Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi , the supremo of spaghetti television , a combination of American serials , sports and silly game shows . The fifth channel , La Cinq , was thus born ' Just before the general election . ( A sixth , Canal Six , was established at the same time , as a kind of MTV . ) La Cinq 's charter , by which the state nominally regulates its programming , was effectively a license to show American-made serials and films untroubled by considerations of educational value , minority opinion or quality . French viewers could add Star Trek to their weekly diet of Starsky and Hutch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western fashion of treating films and plays like sausages , which can be sliced and interspersed at will with advertising . It was one of those cases where you dirty your hands for no purpose . The right , having won the election that March , proceeded to alter altogether what is known , if you wish to be trendy , as the PAF , or French audiovisual landscape . The new government set up a National Commission for Communications and Liberty , or C.N.C.L. , to use again the French abbreviation . This " independent " supervising body at once appointed two political friends of Jacques Chirac , the new Prime Minister , as presidents of Antenne 2 and FR 3 , which for the time being remain in public hands . Canal Plus was allowed to continue its own way , but a new deal had to be reached over the fifth channel , which the right had stymied upon taking office by revoking its license to show films . Berlusconi , the Italian , knew the modern meaning of the old Roman saying pecunia non olet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . The right victorious , it had the prerogative to reshuffle the deck : Berlusconi was asked to share La Cinq not with Seydoux but with Robert Hersant , France 's reactionary press lord , a man who , in addition to the virtues of a Hearst or a Murdoch , has the past of an active Nazi collaborator . The C.N.C.L. also turned the sixth channel , which was supposed to be purely musical , into an all-round network , thus further increasing the competition for advertising revenue . But the C.N.C.L. 's main task was to sell TF 1 , the prosperous government-owned network . The commission completed the sale this past April and even managed to recover its mantle of independence in the process . Everybody expected the channel to be taken over by France 's publishingoctopus , Hachette . It was instead sold to Francis Bouygues , France 's international lord of construction and public works , whose annual business exceeds $8 billion . The consortium headed by Bouygues paid roughly $450 million for half the shares of TF 1 , the other half being offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station 's employees . Bouygues himself holds half the consortium 's shares  --  that is to say a quarter of the total , and a controlling interest . His main junior partner , controlling 12.5 percent of the total , is , significantly , Robert Maxwell , the British press magnate . The C.N.C.L. , incidentally , can now parade its putative independence without any risk . The new master of TF 1 is far from being an enemy of the establishment or of its current rulers . However , the expert in construction must have assumed that in buying the building he was inheriting the staff as well as the furniture . It was not so simple . The newcomer Hersant thought that La Cinq , which can not yet be seen throughout the whole of France , must rapidly gain a substantial share of the audience to be credible for advertisers and that this could best be achieved by poaching the most successful shows from his competitors . Comedians and comperes were wooed with fat contracts . By the time he realized what was happening , Bouygues found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about building an expensive , star-studded news team , which includes , it is worth noting , a trio of women near the very top ( Christine Ockrent , for years the main newscaster on Antenne 2 ; Michele Cotta , an old-timer in press , radio and TV ; and Anne Sinclair , co-host of a popular talk show ) . In the news area alone the income of star performers is approaching the middle six figures in dollars , which may not be in Dan Rather 's class but , allowing for the gap between average French and American salaries , makes announcers here the equivalent of Barbara Walters . The revelation of such exorbitant incomes has , judging by opinion polls , stunned the French public . The French , it appears , know little about the hefty salaries of their businessmen and care little about the big incomes of film stars or of such international sports figures as Michel Platini , the soccer sorcerer , or Alain Prost , the auto racing ace . They do not have the same indulgence for TV personalities , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit with them every evening at dinnertime . That such veritable cousins , however distinguished , should be getting fifty times their income , often for reading a Teleprompter , came as a shock to French viewers . Admittedly , at the very time when the boost in salaries was causing a scandal here , a snippet in the papers disclosed that the top earners on Wall Street were drawing more than $50 million a year ; by those standards even Dan Rather is a poor relation . In its egalitarianism , the French reaction was interesting , but it missed the most dangerous aspects of the shake-up , which each day become more obvious . Last spring , when they were bidding for channels , the tycoons could talk only of freedom , art and culture . In the fall they are back to profits , which for most remain elusive . The altogether reasonable thought is that France may not have enough advertising to support so much private TV . The expensive stars not having carried with them a captive audience , La Cinq is in real financial trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they all know that whoever wins in the end will win big . For now , the tycoons are united in their aim to deprive the public sector of its relatively meager advertising and , since the government will not increase the license fee , virtually of funds . They also want public television to increase its obligations while they shirk their own . Now when they hear the word " culture , " they reach for their computer . While painting the future black , one should not idealize the past . France 's public television was no model . Its main defect was its bald subservience to the government in office . De Gaulle and his successors treated it as " his master 's voice . " Direct government control over content has loosened in recent years , and the condition of television news can not get any worse with competition . The second point to keep in mind is that the commercial invasion did not begin only yesterday . With public channels competing for advertising , ratings were already the holy writ and Dallas and Dynasty the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualitative . Did French TV not produce good shows , plays or documentaries ? It obviously did and will . Anymore than with newspapers , books or radio , the problem is not to produce occasional quality wares for the happy few . As a wealthy man once used to keep a ballerina , Britain 's commercial TV now keeps a fourth channel with some space for innovation , and the French are already experimenting with a seventh channel , European and cultural . What is at stake is the rule , not the exception . The average person in France spends three and a half hours a day watching the little screen . It is the main source of news and entertainment , the main provider of food for thought . It could be an extraordinary instrument of democracy . The public service preserves , in principle , this potential for education , for enlightenment , for a genuine search for different forms of mass culture . A television geared to the marketplace can not be bothered by such impediments . The U.S. pattern of TV must prevail , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . They can put out better soap operas and serials . They have the skilled writers , the slick producers and the huge domestic market . They can , therefore , offer their European customers a more marketable product at a cheaper price . If that were the question , the answer for Europe would lie in a consolidation of resources . But it is not . Nevertheless , consolidation does proceed apace on both sides of the ocean . Scribblers may praise the virtues of small private enterprise , but their bosses are busy amalgamating . Newspapers are being merged , publishers taken over , and finance capital is getting increasingly involved in the media . National giants are looking beyond their frontiers . Berlusconi , after France , is investing in Spanish television . Maxwell is putting money into the French press but also into cables and satellites . So is Rupert Murdoch . Belgium , where you can see several British , French , German and Dutch channels , is a portent of the near future . In fairness , it must be said that Europeans are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few recent examples : Bertelsmann , the big German publisher , took over Doubleday ; Collins from Britain now , thanks to Murdoch , owns half of Harper &; Row ; and though Maxwell failed in his bid for Harcourt , Brace , Jovanovich , that was not the end of his American ambitions . The nationality of the streamliners is not really so relevant . As Byron put it , in another context , it matters little whether it is " the Jew Rothschild or his fellow Christian Baring . " It is , however , symbolic that Rupert Murdoch , the Australian who transited through London , chose to become an American citizen . As they extend their field of operations , the media magnates may tend to move to the heart of the Western empire . In any case , if the Europeans want to resist the dominion of Dallasty , they will not do it through pale imitation . But , comes the second objection , people get the television they like and deserve . Those who argue this way also call the majority silent when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suggesting that the international masters of the media meet regularly on an island to plot how to turn us all into morons . We must simply acknowledge that commercialism , with its emphasis on the lowest common denominator , tends to bring intellectual preoccupations down to the level of the latest " romance " of Joan Collins or  --  a question of generation  --  the color of Madonna 's underwear . And this from the Pacific to the Elbe , though not yet to the Urals . The third objection is more valid . A television , it insists , reflects a social system , and Europe will not be able to escape its American future unless it forges a radically different society . A recent French example confirms this point . Five years ago , after they got into office , the Socialists proclaimed the freedom of the airwaves , abolishing the state 's radio monopoly . Optimists assumed that a new era was to begin in broadcasting . Hopes did not last long . The small stations , though numerous , did not dominate without a grass-roots movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . A basic principle was reasserted almost at once . In our world , when the distasteful dictatorship of the state is lifted , it is only to be replaced by the naked tyranny of money . God , as usual , was on the side of the big and wealthy battalions . French broadcasting is now dominated by corporations . The FM wavelength in Paris sounds more and more like the one in New York  --  a bit of freedom and a lot of commercial schmaltz . Come to think of it , the lesson is not peculiar to Europe . It applies on both sides of the ocean . Here and there , we shall not have a radically different television , or radio or press , unless we do something about society as a whole . This should not prevent us from trying to influence the media , even if we have few illusions about the imminence of the transformation . Meanwhile , dear reader , without illusions but also without complexes , we must find the most convenient position within the cracks in the system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistic mood , can we dream of the day when the chinks and crevices grow big enough to bring the whole system down . J.R . and his universe will be buried in the ruins .
