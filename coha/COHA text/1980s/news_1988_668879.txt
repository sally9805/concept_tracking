Bloody Season By Loren D. Estleman Bantam , 231 pages , $15. 95 The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral lasted barely 15 seconds , but the shots are still heard around the world , more than 100 years later . Along with the Custer ' s Last Stand , the celebrated shootout has been the most aggressively recycled and merchandised of all Western myths , making international folk heroes out of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday and serving as the rickety inspiration for scores of pulp novels and movies ( the best but probably the most inaccurate of which is John Ford ' s dusty ballad , " My Darling Clementine " ) . Loren D. Estleman hasn ' t let all the overkill stop him from making yet another expedition into Tombstone Territory . In " Bloody Season , " he exhumes Doc and Wyatt , along with his four brothers , the scurrilous Clantons and McLaurys , Bat Masterson , Johnny Ringo and the rest of the gang , for a brawny reprise of the Tombstone shootings . In one major respect , Estleman ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than ends , with the 1881 gunfight , in which three men were killed , none of whom was on the side of Earp and Holliday . That wasn ' t necessarily the side of law and order , according to Estleman ' s revisionist version of the O.K. Corral fireworks . Though Earp was a church deacon and wore a badge when it served his purposes , he was less interested in keeping the peace than in protecting his private stake in Tombstone saloons , gambling concessions and whorehouses . And Holliday was not simply a quick-tempered scoundrel but a violent alcoholic and card cheat , whose favorite sport was beating up his mistress , the whore and madame " Big Nose " Kate Fisher . Worse , Earp and Holliday didn ' t win the battle at the O.K. Corral because they were fast on the draw but because they were first . As Estleman reconstructs the showdown , evidently from eyewitness accounts , the transcripts of a coroner ' s jury and other documents , they opened fire on the Clanton and McLaury brothers even though two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s better known as a mystery writer , Estleman is also an old Western hand , who ( like his Detroit partner in crime fiction , Elmore Leonard ) is as much at home on the range as he is in an urban precinct station . With " Bloody Season , " he has stirred up a hearty kettle of fiction and fact , possibly the truest and grittiest account yet of that uproarious chapter in frontier history . But in this case , Estleman is a better historian than storyteller . Because it ' s such a tangled yarn , the plot tends to wander in circles , while a lot of his invented dialogue has false whiskers . And toward the end , he simply abandons any pretense that he ' s writing fiction , concluding with an elegiac tour of contemporary Tombstone . In his attempt to set the record straight , Estleman does manage to dispose of a lot of ancient deadwood . For one thing , he points out that the shootout did not actually take place at the O.K.

Somehow , " The Gunfight at Sly ' s Boardinghouse " doesn ' t have quite the same dramatic impact . CAPTION : PHOTO : ( From the book jacket . ) Illustration PHOTO <>
