The messages keep coming at Ronald Reagan , from friends , senior leaders of both parties , veteran public officials belatedly summoned to provide outside counsel , even his wife . Their essence can be put in one word : act . Fire Chief of Staff Donald Regan or CIA Director William Casey , or both , as proof that the Administration intends to make a fresh start . Call the key figures in the Iran arms-contra funds scandal , Oliver North and John Poindexter , into the Oval Office and demand from them an accounting of their activities . But above all , do something . Do n't just wait for inquisitive journalists , congressional investigators or , eventually , an independent counsel to force out all the facts about North 's sticky web of arms and money dealings .

That charge is being made publicly by Democrats who have little evidence and obvious axes to grind , but it is a suspicion that is being voiced within the Executive Branch as well . According to one Government source , the Iranian arms profits were diverted into a political slush fund . According to another source close to the FBI , the bureau is " looking into the possibility of a connection " between money that was supposed to have gone to the contras and " Republican campaign contributions . " <P> Spokesmen at the White House and the FBI say they have no knowledge of that particular inquiry , and those people who have been cited as potential conduits for the funding of political campaigns deny any involvement . But officials note that the investigation into all aspects of the matter is still wide open . <P> Among the other revelations last week in the murky affair :
