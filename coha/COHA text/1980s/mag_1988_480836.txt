Last spring the writer and critic William Gass published an essay in this magazine entitled " Goodness Knows Nothing of Beauty , " an essay which toyed with the proposition that art and moral aspiration were mutually distant . Statements of this view very often seek to replicate in their style the kind of cool , amoral elegance they claim for good art , and Gass 's piece is not in this regard exceptional . It is characterized by paradox , alliteration , and a faintly decadent naughtiness suggestive of intense sophistication . In the end , as such pieces often do , it resolves itself solipsistically ; that is , it explains itself away in terms of its own moral and aesthetic definitions . But it is interesting to see this old opposition between art and morality appear again , offered by a commentator usually wise and insightful . " To be a preacher is to bring your sense of sin to the front of the church , " Gass writes , " but to be an artist is to give to every mean and ardent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godlike shape . " If Robert Stone 's short story " Absence of Mercy " appeared in the November 1987 issue of Harper 's Magazine . He is at work on his fifth novel . This essay is based on a talk he gave recently at the New York Public Library , sponsored by the Book-of-the-Month Club . this means that you get no points in art for good intentions , no one would argue . But I find here echoes of an old antinomian tendency that goes back at least to Nietzsche . It has been argued by people as different as Jose Ortega y Gasset and Oscar Wilde ; by Joyce speaking in character as Stephen Daedalus ; and by Shaw during the period when he was writing Major Barbara and , it now appears , attempting to invent fascism . In this antinomian vision , morality and art are independent and even in opposition . On the right squats morality . It may be imagined as a neoGothic structure ? immense , ornate , and sterile . Its self-satisfaction , lack of imagination , and philistine sentimentality are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembles the Mormon Temple , the one in downtown Salt Lake City , not the Hollywood-biblical one on Santa Monica Boulevard . It contains drear echoing silences . And over here ? art . Art is nothing but beautiful . Art is like a black panther . It has the glamour of the desperado . Art is radical , the appealing cousin of crime . Never a dull moment with art . Morality , in this view , is not only its opposite but its enemy . This claim of estrangement between morality and art retains its currency for an excellent reason : it 's fun . It 's agreeable for an artist to imagine himself as a Zarathustrian rope-dancer , balanced against eternity up in the ozone and thin light , while far below the eunuchs of the brown temple of morality whine platitudes at each otl , er in the incense-ridden noonday darkness : " I ssok before you leap . " " A stitch in time saves nine . " But let us pursue this notion . Let us imagine the novel , for example , freed completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing it might be like is one of the anti-novels Robbe-Grillet gave us 00. ? during the 1950s and ' 60s . These are novels without any moral context , but they are similarly without characters and plots , beginnings and endings . Surely such an exercise in doing without something serves to reinforce the idea of its necessity . Is it possible to postulate the idea of a successful novel about people , or about animals for that matter , in which the living of life , as reflected therein , exists beyond the signal area of moral reference points ? What about the comic novel ? Let 's eliminate at the outset the obviously sentimental or political comedies that have a message ( that is , a moral point ) at their core . Let 's take the work of two writers ? William Burroughs and Evelyn Waugh ? who have written very funny books and who are not usually thought of as kindly humanistic sages . Naked Lunch is the prototypical Burroughs novel , and like all the others it 's full of cruelty not just sadism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it contains is sometimes claimed as representing a moral dimension , but I think that 's bogus . The moral element in the work of William Burroughs is in its very humor . In the grimmest imaginable places , in the grammar of drug addiction , in the violence and treachery of the addict 's world , Burroughs finds laughter . The laughter itself is a primary moral response . Laughter represents a rebellion against chaos , a rejection of evil , and an affirmation of balance and soundness . One can see this principle at work in the way that laughter undercuts super-serious attempts at self-consciously " wicked " sex . I was once given a description of a waterfront S &M; joint that presented itself as the meanest saloon on earth . There was a dress code , and patrons were expected to present to any observer nothing less than a grim mask of depravity . There were two house rules , according to my informant . The first was , no rugby shirts . The second was no laughing . We must assume that the people who run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waugh seems to have been lacking in all the qualities we philanthropists find congenial . A bully , a coward , a fascist , a despiser of minor ities and the poor , a groveler before the rich and powerful , Waugh was surely one of the worst human beings ever to become a major novelist . But paradoxically , his life and work provide us with a ringing confirmation of the dependence of serious fiction on morality . By borrowing , spuriously or otherwise ( it does n't matter ) , the certainties of Catholicism , he was able to infuse his best work with the moral center that makes it great . The worldly lives described in the Men at Arms trilogy and Brideshead Revisited are constantly being measured against a rigorous neo-Jansenist Christianity . In these books the invisible world becomes the real one , and its meanings constitute the truth that undergirds the confusion of desires with which the characters struggle . ass 's essay starts by having us ask ourselves whether we 'd rescue an infant or a Botticelli painting , if we saw both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . The Botticelli 's a masterpiece , the baby 's only a " potential " human being . After prescribing this antinomian exercise , he commences to deflate his own balloon by running it on the thorns of common sense . He refers to the author 's historical struggle against censorship , as though this somehow establishes art 's essentially unmoral character , and then admits that each censoring hierarchy reacts to whatever inadequacies of its moral system are challenged by the work in question . He reminds us that good books were written by bad people ? had people ( and crafters of fine moral fiction ) like Waugh , I assume . Then he ends with a truism to the effect that propaganda can not justify bad art or bad writing . There are few statements in the essay which Gass does not obviate or contradict , but there is one that stays , unforsworn and unqualified , in my recollection . He refers to Keats 's identification of beauty with truth and vice versa as " a fatuous little motto . " Now it seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; surely we should meditate for a moment on this most appealing sentiment . Is n't it true ? Concerning Life , it is a question we can not finally answer . I think it tends to be true . The explanation at the core of any one of nature 's mysteries is often edifying . Job cuts through to the substance of it when he questions the beneficence of God . In the end he learns that God 's majesty and holiness suffuse the universe . This is what the medieval mystic Julian of Norwich was referring to when she wrote " all shall be well and all shall be well and all manner of things shall be well , " In terms of Western tradition it should he true that truth is beauty . Even if you take God out of it , the grimmest principles of existence have their symmetry . All the same , there can be a hundred different explanations for things and every one of them beautiful and none of them true . But , in art , is n't it always true ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every aesthetic response entails a recognition . What standard do we hold up to art , other than things themselves ? And what do we require from art if not a reflection of things , of our lives , in all their variety ? We in the Western world are what the Moslems call " people of the book . " The prototypical book in this culture has been the Bible , regardless of whether or not we are believers . After centuries of being Christians and Jews , our context and our perceptions continue to be conditioned by the Bible 's narratives . It 's hard to overestimate the impact of the Bible on our civilization and on our language . The novel came into existence with the rise of a literate mass readership , and the greatest vehicle of mass literacy in the English-speaking world has been the King James Bible . It has been the great primer . The Bible is unique among religious books in the relationship it defines between God and man , and in the view it takes of human life . The narratives about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean something . They are thought to be significant . This implies that the corporeal world in which people live is not an illusion to be overcome , or a shadow land reflecting the void , but an instrument of God 's will . For centuries we have been reflecting on peculiar things like why Esau was disinherited , and how Abraham could have been ready to sacrifice his son ? and asking ourselves : What does this mean ? What is at the heart of this strange story ? What can I learn from it ? How does it bear on my situation ? All our philosophies of history descend from the assumptions bequeathed by our Scriptures : they profess to detect the informing principles at the heart of human events . Life matters , lives matter , because earthly human history is the arena in which the universe acts out its consciousness of itself , displaying its nature as creation . Human annals become charged , they become an entity : history . History then is perceived as a rational process , the unfolding of a design , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of things . Any fictional work of serious intent argues for the significance of its story . A reader holds the characters in judgment , investing sympathy or withholding it , always alert for recognitions , hoping to see his lonely state reflected across time , space , and circumstance . How then can fiction ever be independent of morality ? To be so , it would have to be composed of something other than language . There is no brown temple , where morality resides . There is no high wire above it where the artist whirls in freedom . If there is a wire it 's the wire we 're all on out here , the one we live on , with only each other for company . Our having each other is both the good news and the bad . We deceive ourselves , we contemporary people , if we imagine that beneath our feet is a great , sound structure , a vast warehouse called civilization , chock-a-block with boring , reliable truths and insights . Around us there is only deep space . Out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mostly impromptu . Right-mindedness is cheap ? but goodness ? William Gass need not worry about its coming between ourselves and our pleasures . Lost journalists who worked in It was not necessarily that it was so uniquely horrible ; it was only that the brutality and confusion one experienced seemed to lose something when rendered , when written . Somehow , in describing the situation so that it could be set up in columns of type , one always seemed to be cleaning it up . As I pondered this process , a moment of illumination struck me . We are forever cleaning up our act . Not only in describing ourselves but in imagining ourselves , we project a self-image that is considerably idealized . In all our relationships , we present idealized versions of ourselves so as not to frighten others with our primary processes . And just as we individually cultivate an elevated image of ourselves , so we conspire as nations , peoples ? as humankind ? to create a fictional exemplar of our collective selves , ourselves as we have agreed to imagine ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are only what we are , we have the amazing ability to extend , to transcend the grimmest circumstances . Moments occur when we amaze each other with acts of hope , acts of courage that can make one proud to he human . The fact is that we absolutely require the elevated image of ourselves which we indulge . If we did not idealize ourselves , if we only accepted the reality of ourselves as we are most of the time , we would never be capable of the extensions of ourselves that are required of us . Things are in the saddle , Emerson said , and ride mankind . " Whirl is king . " Things happen ruthlessly , without mercy ; the elemental force of things bears down upon us . From one moment to the next we hardly know what 's going on let alone what it all means . Civilization and its attendant morality are not structures , they 're more like notions , and sometimes they can seem very distant notions . They can be blown away in a second , In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the morality to which we publicly subscribe seems so alien to our actual behavior that it seems to emanate from some other sphere . One might call it a fiction , but it 's a fiction that we most urgently require . It is much more difficult to act well than we are ready to admit . It can be extremely hard to act sensibly , let alone well . Storytelling is not a ' luxury to humanity ; it 's almost as necessary as bread . We can not imagine ourselves without it because each self is a story . The perception each of us has of his own brief transient passage through things is also a kind of fiction , not because its matter is necessarily untrue , but because we tend to shape it to suit our own needs . We tell ourselves our own stories selectively , in order to keep our sense of self intact . As dreams are to waking life , so fiction is to reality . The brain ca n't function without clearing its circuits during sleep , nor can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the world of the imagination , sorting and refining the random promiscuity of events . If the practice of fiction is inextricably linked with concerns of morality , what is there to say about the writer 's responsibility ? The writer 's responsibility , it seems to me , consists in writing well and truly , to use a Hemingwayesque locution . The writer who betrays his calling is that writer who either for commercial or political reasons vulgarizes his own perception and his rendering of it . Meretricious writing tries to conventionalize what it describes in order to make itself safer and easier to take . It may do this to conform to a political agenda , which is seen as somehow overriding mere literary considerations , or under commercial pressures to appeal to what are seen as the limitations of a mass audience . The effect of conventionalized , vulgarized writing is pernicious . Fiction is , or should be , an act against loneliness , an appeal to community , a bet on the possibility of spanning the gulf that separates one human being from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human condition in order to bring more of that condition into the light of conscious insight . It is part of the process which expands human self-knowledge . Meretricious fiction does the opposite of what fiction is supposed to do . The reassurances it offers are superficial and empty . It presents a reality that is limited by its own im poverishment , and as a result , it increases each individual 's loneliness and isolation . In the absence of honest storytelling , people are abandoned to the beating of their own hearts . It must be emphasized that the moral imperative of fiction provides no excuse for smug moralizing , religiosity , or propaganda . On the contrary , it forbids them . Nor does it require that every writer equip his work with some edifying message advertising progress , brotherhood , and light . It does not require a writer to be a good man , only a good wizard . Above all , what I wish to argue is that the laws of both language and art impose choices that arc unavoidably moral . The first law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law that requires the artist to constantly make decisions , to choose between symme-try and asymmetry , restraint and ex-cess , balance and imbalance . Because this law is ruthlessly self-enforcing in arc , the quality of the artist 's work will depend on his making the right deci-sion . The same law operates the scales the blindfolded woman in the court-house holds . Artistic quality is related to justice . Grammar is related to log-ic , which is the engine of conscience . Language is always morally weighted . Nothing is free . Political situations have always atwith the reaction to it . The novel centered on the exploitation of electronic media by the extreme Right , a phenomenon which we have not altogether put behind us . A Hall of Mirrors was not a strictly " realistic " book , but as young writers will , I put every single thing I thought I knew into it . I gave my characters names with the maximum number of letters because I thought that would make them more substantial . I had taken America as my subject , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years later , working in Vietnam , I found myself witnessing a mistake ten thousand miles long , a mistake on the American scale . I began to write a novel set in Saigon . As it progressed , I realized that the logic of the thing required that everybody make his or her way hack home , into the America of the early 1970s . The early to mid- ' 70s still seem to me , in retrospect , like a creepy , evil time . A lot of hills from the ' 60s were coming up for presentation . Dog Soldiers was my reaction to the period . I went to Central America in 1978 to go scuba diving while at work on a new novel , and returned to the region several times thereafter . I became acquainted with a few Americans working there . At that time relatively few people in this country knew where Huehuetenango was , and Managua , Nicaragua , was the title of an old Andrews Sisters song . The Somozas had been running Nicaragua for many years and they seemed quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Everything was quiet there . One day 1 even semi-crashed a party at the Presidential Palace . The palace stood in the middle of what was literally a fallen city . From a distance , downtown Managua looked like a park ? it was so green . When you got a closer look you could see that the green was that of vegetation growing over the rubble where the center of the city had collapsed two days before Christmas in 1972 . The palace stood unscathed in the middle of the destruction . Around it was a kind of free-fire zone of scrub jungle where no one was permitted . The palace stood just beyond the effective mortar distance from the nearest habitation . During my trips to Central America , I began to make a point of listening to as many stories as I could . After a while the stories began to form a pattern that conformed to my sense of Mesoamerica 's history . This band of republics between the Andes and the Grijalva seemed placed by its gods in a very fateful situation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most fanatical inquisitors . When they arrived , the Spaniards found holy wells of human sacrifice . Here , racial and social oppression had always been most severe . The fertile soil of the place seemed to bring forth things to provoke the appetite rather than things to nourish ? baubles and rich toys , plantation crops for your sweet tooth or for your head . These lands were eventually yoked to labor-intensive , high-profit products , bananas , of course , and coffee , chocolate , tobacco , chicle , emeralds , marijuana , cocaine . I decided to put down the book I was writing and begin a new one . My subject was again America ; the United States had been involved here for so long . The new novel became my third , A Flag for Sunrise . Children of Light , a novel about the movies published in 1986 , is also political , in my view . The process of creating Hollywood movies is loaded with examples of how America works . People in the film industry who see Children of Light as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverent it really is . Ido not claim to know much more people , it 's difficult to avoid politics . But if a novelist openly accepts that his work must necessarily contain moral and political dimensions , what responsibilities does he take on ? He assumes , above all , the responsibility to understand . The novel that admits to a political dimension requires a knowledge , legitimately or illegitimately acquired , intuitive or empirical , of the situation that is its subject . Political commitment is not required , although eventually most authors maneuver themselves into a stand . I think the key is to establish the connection between political forces and individual lives . The questions to address are : How do social and political forces condition individual lives ? How do the personal qualities of the players condition their political direction ? The novelist has to cast the net of his sympathies fairly wide . He should be able to imagine his way into the personae of many different people , with different ways of thinking and believing . The aspiring , overtly political novelist might spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of General Noriega , a man who actually exists . As far as political satire goes , it should be remembered that the best satire requires a certain subversive sympathy for one 's subject . The writer must remember the first law of heaven : nothing is free . Commitment can be useful because it brings a degree of passion to bear , but it 's also dangerous . To be the contented partisan of one side or another , one has to sell something . Because so much of serious politics in this century has to do with violence , this can he a morally enervating exercise . Moral enervation is bad for writers . Above all , the writer must not sentimentalize . He must remember that sentimentality is the great enemy of genuine sentiment . I believe that it is impossible for any novelist to find a subject other than the transitory nature of moral perception . The most important thing about people is the difficulty they have in identifying and acting upon what 's right . The world is full of illusion . We carry nemesis inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a whimsical friend of mine made up a little ditty that for me sums up the backwards-and-forwards tragi-comical nature of humanity 's march . It 's a highly moral little ditty and it may contain the essence of every work of serious literature ever written . It goes like this : Of offering more than what we can deliver , we have a bad habit it is true . But we have to offer more than what we can deliver to be able to deliver what we do .
