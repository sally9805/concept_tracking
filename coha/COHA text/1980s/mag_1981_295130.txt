Once a cottage industry serving the fringes of society , illicit drugs have become a brutal big business where customers are increasingly upscale , if no less immune to the dangers of abuse . For this week 's cover story on cocaine , the most deceptive and expensive of drugs , TIME sent a team of correspondents to measure its burgeoning popularity across the country . Jonathan Beaty interviewed sources in Washington , D.C. , New Mexico and Southern California , while Jeff Melvoin traveled in New England , Florida and Colorado , and Steven Holmes covered Northern California and the Midwest . Correspondent Robert L. Goldstein spoke with movie celebrities in Los Angeles and Reporter-Researcher Rosemarie Tauris talked to dancers and psychiatrists in New York City . Says Beaty : <P> " We began our assignment assuming that cocaine fans were found mainly among the glittery rich in Hollywood and Manhattan . As the story shows , cocaine has become a very middle class phenomenon and can be found everywhere . " <P> Though the illegal status of cocaine meant keeping the names of many sources confidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about their experiences with the drug . Says he : " The fact that they were so relaxed with a reporter is an indication of how casual cocaine use has become . " But Beaty found that some cocaine dealers in Los Angeles were considerably more cautious : " It was the first time I had been in an attorney 's office with semiautomatic weapons leaned up against the wall . It is safe to say that the paranoia level was high on all sides . " Senior Editor Christopher Porterfield , who edited the cover , was struck by the complexity of the current cocaine craze , both in its origins and implications . " Unlike heroin , cocaine use ca n't be tied to poverty and neglect , " he says . " It seems to have more to do with social ritual , spiritual impoverishment and lack of confidence in the future . " Senior Writer Michael Demarest , who wrote the main story , speculates that cocaine 's appeal is at least partly explained by its association with power and prestige . Says he : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be around for a long tune . "
