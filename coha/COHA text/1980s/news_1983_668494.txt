Another rock - or perhaps a pebble - has been tossed into the already muddy waters of condominium conversion in Cambridge . One member of the city ' s five-person rent control board has declared , in a letter , that a law which effectively bars condo conversion is no longer in effect . However , the chairman of the board says that the member was acting unilaterally , and , as far as he is concerned , the law is in effect . A city councilor and a tenant activist agree with the chairman , but a pro- condo lawyer says : " The ball game is over . " The controversy , which is always just below the surface of Cambridge politics , involves an amendment passed in 1979 to the city ' s rent control law , called the " removal ordinance . " It makes it necessary to obtain a permit from the rent control board to remove a rent-controlled apartment from the market for any reason - demoliton , conversion to office or manufacturing use , or conversion to a condominium . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat in the past three years , since only a handful of permits have been granted to the hundreds who have sought to convert apartments into condos . It is , in effect , a " freeze " on converting older apartments into condos . Last week , board member Sally Ackerman , herself a condo owner , sent a letter to the city clerk which said that the removal permit provision " should no longer be in effect " because the number of rental units in the city had increased , according to the 1980 census . The law says that if the number of rental units increases , then permission for condo conversion is no longer necessary . The law was designed to ensure a supply of apartments for low and moderate income tenants . But tenant activists and at least one councilor , the author of the condo law , are challenging Ackerman ' s figures , saying that she included quasipublic housing units to inflate the numbers . Mike Turk , of the Cambridge Rent Control Coalition , said : " There ' s been a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condo conversions , particularly in the late ' 70s , when several thousand units were converted . " David Sullivan , a lawyer and city councilor who often takes the side of tenants , said : " The removal ordinance is in full force and effect and I expect it to continue indefinitely . I believe the rent control board will continue to enforce it . . . . Cambridge tenants shouldn ' t have to worry . " He said Ackerman ' s " numbers are wrong and the whole board didn ' t agree to this . " The chairman of the rent control board , Acheson Callaghan , said : " I ' m not sure the ( Ackerman* letter had any effect . The board is continuing to process these cases ( removal permits* and there ' s been no change in the usualprocedure . " He said the board decided this past week to commission a staff report to analyze the census figures to arrive at a consensus on the actual number of rental units . The city has about 30,000 rental units , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . Ackerman , who made it clear in an interview that she was speaking solely as a member of the board , and did not presume to represent its official stance , said : " The letter has created a real flurry . " The reason I wrote it was that the board was not taking any initiative regarding the statistics . " " Frankly , I don ' t know " what legal effect the letter has , she said , but " I think it ' s a very unfair ordinance . The idea of condo control is reasonable , but to ban owner occupancy is ludicrous . " William Walsh , an attorney who represents many condo owners and developers , said he believes that " filing ( the letter* with the city clerk was sufficient to end the removal ordinance . . . there seems to be a very serious question as to whether there is an ordinance . " The City Council meets again on Aug. 8 , where this latest chapter in the condo controversy is expected to be a hot topic . Turk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s letter as just another skirmish in an ongoing battle : " This is just one more maneuver that occurs in an election year , a flanking maneuver to weaken confidence in the ( condo* ordinance.
