On the eve of a primary known in the past for its volatility , Senator Gary Hart of Colorado campaigned feverishly to capitalize on a recent surge of support that even Mondale aides acknowledged in their final surveys . Mr. Hart predicted a strong second-place showing , while Mondale officials insisted that the Hart gain was taking votes from the six other major Democratic candidates , not from Mr. Mondale. // Contributing to the uncertainty was the forecast for a winter storm of snow , sleet or freezing rain that could reduce the expected turnout of 110 , 000 Democratic voters . A severe storm would most probably favor Mr. Mondale , election officials said , because he has by far the largest organization of workers prepared to take Mondale voters to the polls. // // An Important Contest // // Even though this conservative , sparsely settled state is far from representative of the nation , or even of New England , its primary is considered highly important , both for raising some candidates to national prominence and for ending the hopes of others . Since 1952 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Hampshire primary. // The latest poll , by Claibourne Darden Jr. , gave Mr. Mondale 38 percent of the vote , Mr. Hart 22 , Senator John Glenn of Ohio 15 , the Rev. Jesse Jackson 7 , and former Senator George McGovern of South Dakota 6 percent. // The remaining 11 percent was divided among Senator Alan Cranston of California , Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and former Gov . Reubin Askew of Florida. // Pre-election polls are widely used as a gauge of contestant support but are frequently unreliable in state primary elections , because of uncertainty about voter turnout. // The Mondale and Hart efforts were lifted by their showings in the Iowa caucuses , the first step in the long process of Presidential nomination . Mr. Mondale took nearly 50 percent of the votes there , and Mr. Hart was second with 16 percent . Mr. Glenn placed fifth in Iowa . <> <> Unexpected Admission // // It has been a primary campaign marked by unexpected turns of events in the closing hours . The surprise this year came from Mr. Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synagogue in Manchester Sunday night and acknowledged he had referred to Jews in an informal conversation as " Hymies . " It was a remark that he had previously denied and that had damaged his appeal to the white audiences of this state for a " rainbow coalition " of various groups . The Jackson episode was not expected to have much effect on the outcome of the voting among the leading contenders. // Nor was the effort by conservative Republicans to persuade Democrats to write in President Reagan ' s name on the Democratic ballot , even though admiration for the President often reaches heroic proportions among voters here. // But both added to the uncertainty as the campaign , which began two years ago for some of the candidates , came to a close . Candidates and voters alike seemed weary of the speeches , the advertisements , the canvasses and telephone pleadings that have saturated almost every community in this state of fewer than one million people . <> <> Contrasting Finishes // Mr. Mondale and Mr. Hart ended their campaigns in contrasting fashion . While Mr. Hart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after an early-morning visit to the Myrna shoe factory in Manchester , left the state for Boston with no plans to return until after the votes are counted Tuesday. // A Mondale campaign official denied that Mr. Mondale was cutting his campaigning short because his presence would not add to his support. // " He wants to let his organization do their work on the final day and not to distract from their getting out the vote , " the official said. // Mr. Mondale himself said , " I think I ' m going to do well , but I ' m not going to get into the expectation game . I ' m not taking anything for granted. " // Mr. Hart , on the other hand , met audiences all day and wound up his campaign tonight with a rally in which he answered questions from a radio audience . His aides exuded optimism and Mr. Hart said , " We are not going to fail. " // " I think we ' ve already won in New Hampshire , " he said , noting that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks ago he was given little chance of competing with Mr. Mondale. // GLANCE <> <> History // New Hampshire citizens , fiercely proud of their first-in- the-nation primary , note that since 1952 , when the names of candidates first appeared on ballots in the state , no one has won the Presidency without first winning the New Hampshire primary . The state has been a political graveyard for some candidates , most notably Edmund Muskie in 1972 , who won by a smaller margin than as expected , and as a springboard for others . In 1980 , Ronald Reagan defeatged George Bush , giving his campaign more credibility and momentum . <> <> Candidates // The primary lists 22 Democrats and 5 Republicans on the ballot . Of the Republicans , only President Reagan is considered a serious contender . There are eight Democrats with full delegate slates filed : Reubin Askew , Alan Cranston , John Glenn , Gary Hart , Ernest F. Hollings , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , George McGovern , and Walter F. Mondale . In addition , a write-in campaign for President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State // The picture of New Hampshire as a rural , Yankee backwater is no longer accurate . Although the northern part of the state remains wooded and sparsely populated , the southern region is heavily industrialized , with high-technology industry predominating . In addition , large groups of French-Americans and Greek-Americans now live in New Hampshire , belying the Yankee image . Nevertheless , the populace retains many of the values embodied in the Yankee stereotype : conservatism , self- reliance and a general disdain for big government and government interference . <> <> Voters // Republicans and independents outnumber Democrats in this traditionally conservative state . Of the state ' s 450 , 000 registered voters , 184 , 000 are Republicans , 134 , 000 are affiliated with neither party , and 133 , 000 are Democrats . Over 110 , 000 are expected to vote in the Democratic primary ; because President Reagan faces no major opposition , the turnout for the Republican primary is expected to be less , which would be the first such occurrence in this century . <> <> Delegates // Only 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . In the Republican Party , all 22 delegates are awarded to a candidate in proportion to the percentage of the vote he receives in the primary . Under the Democratic procedure , 16 delegates will be awarded to candidates based on their showing in the primary , four will be elected later by these delegates and state Democratic leaders , and the remaining two will be the state party chairman and vice chairman , <> <> Results // In New Hampshire ' s towns , the polls will be open from 10 A.M. to 6 or 7 P.M. In the cities , the polls are open from 10 to 8 . Substantial returns are expected about 10 P.M. The cities use voting booths , the towns use paper ballots. //
