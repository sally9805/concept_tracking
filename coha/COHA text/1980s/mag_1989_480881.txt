Our mothers brought us all up to be nice people . We all knew what it meant . Around the age of fifteen we may have thought niceness was too uncool and was retarding our development as sex symbols and we may have bumped around in the dark for a while , being nice and trying to hide it , but eventually we came out as a very nice person , or basically nice , or nice once you get to know him . Or not so nice . Nice people are quiet and responsible and do n't make you pay a big price for their presence . They do n't beg or threaten , they are self-effacing , and they do what they can to make human life smooth and enjoyable . The fact that there are no flies on you does n't qualify you as nice , nor the fact that you never burned the flag or that an independent prosecutor has decided not to seek an indictment . It 's who you are that counts , not your reputation . So it 's unfortunate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Aunt Hazel , the Mother Teresa of Bonhornme , Iowa , hears via the Methodist grapevine that a neighbor named Mildred has told numerous Bonhommeans that she , Hazel , is n't as nice as everyone thinks Garrison Keillor 's new book , We Are Still Married : Stories and Letters , will be pub , lished in April by Viking . but is " selfish " and has a " glorified opinion " of herself , it knocks your poor aunt flat on her back . Stunned , she leaves the Community Outreach luncheon in tears , drives straight home , and spends the afternoon weeping on the couch , bewildered by hostility from a woman she had gone out of her way to be nice to . She imagines Mildred cutting her up all over town with lie after shabby lie ; but this cruel injustice does not make your aunt angry ? it fills her with sadness , and she feels depressed for days , imagining the terrible things people are thinking about her . It does no good to tell this wonderful Christian woman , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar , a piece of baggage . She drinks big rumblers of sherry in the morning , her house is filthy , her cucumbers are puny , her begonias are all eaten up with bugs . Do n't let the bitch get you down . " Hazel is unable to think in those terms . She 's all torn up over it . Of course , who can blame Mil-dred that Hazel 's extreme niceness invites disbelief ? Hazel 's reputa-tion suffers from a lack of negatives . Her faithful service to the church , the library , the Girl Scouts , the 4-H , the park board , the Bijou Theater renovation committee , the soup kitchen and shelter where she volunteers two days a week , her Sunday vis-its to the county jail , the parade of damaged children she has taken under her wing , her lifetime of Christian charity and hopeful good hu-mor in the face of drought and illness and death ? peo-ple are hungry to hear a bad word about her . Some Bonhommeans suspect that Hazel suffers from occa-sional depression and that she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time . lf , on the other hand , she were a profes-sional wrestler named Olga the Mis-tress of Death and Whore of Babylon , a three-hundred-pound witch with black lipstick and green-and-purple hair who spat big gobs on the flag and carried a whip and waggled her boobs at the referee and gouged her oppo-nent Betty Anderson 's eyes and screeched weird obscenities into the darkness , she 'd have a million fans around America , including many in Bonhomme , who 'd say , " You know , in real life Olga 's really a nice person . She knits and cooks and is de-voted to her husband and children . " But as Hazel the Soul of Kindness she has a hard row to hoe : after her three decades of good works , people say , " 1 heard that she may have seen a psychologist at one time . " the band warming up , the beer on ice , and the honored guest , Donnie , dressed in rags and smelling of pig shit , and his dad hugging him . His dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his dad was n't a hugger , but he was all wrapped around the prodigal . The brother said , " What 's happening ? Oh , hi , Don . Nice to see ya , fella . What 's going on , Dad ? " Then he caught the gleam on Donnie 's finger . " The emerald ? You 're giving him the emerald ring that you told me ? Dad , you promised me that ring . Two years ago . This is n't right , Dad . " Hot angry tears filled his eyes , but nice person that he was , he also felt darn guilty about making a stink when everybody else in the parable was jumping up and down . His dad said , " Look ! It 's Donnie ! He left and now he 's back ! Be happy ! We 're having veal tonight ! " So Donnie 's brother smiled and had a beer , but with a certain contrary inner resonance . Great . Wonderful , Dad . Terrific . be hitting the sack now . Back 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll sleep in the pigpen , seeing as how you go for that . See ya later , Don . Help yourself to my stuff . Clothes , jewels , shekels. just take what you need , Don . Take my room . Want me to introduce you to my fiancee Sheila ? Soon afterward , the prodigal 's brother joined a humane society opposed to cruel practices in the meat industry , e.g. , calf fattening . Poor dumb animals kept chained up in cramped dark pens and force-fed to produce pale tender veal for a feast to honor a jerk . The brother was a liberal , or Samaritan , as liberals were known in those days , and while there were a few bad Samaritans , about 95 percent of them were nice people who would have stopped to lend assistance To anyone who needed it ? a man set upon by thieves , for example . But if you run off and waste your substance on riotous living with a fast crowd in Galilee , you should n't expect to come home and get a feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Story : jerks rewarded , nice people abused . Take the liberals that our next president , George Bush , spent the campaign kicking down the stairs , the one or two that Ronald Reagan had n't kicked already . These are n't Iranian liberals , they 're a bunch of extremely nice American people . Call them reformers , progressives , New Dealers , or call them the Great Satan of Massachusetts and His Hounds of Heil : liberals are fundamentally democrats with a quick social conscience who carry water for a million good causes from here to 123 Maple Street , Anywhere , U.S.A. They are teachers , boosters , and inveterate instillers of social obligation . Call them schoolmarms , goody two shoes , busybodies , or bleeding hearts : basically , a liberal is a person whom you know very well and who loves you very very much , perhaps more than you deserve . Who wanted you to be aware of the hungry children in China as you played with the food on your plate ? Who taught you to take turns on the swings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty for being such a greedy selfish little child ? Who taught you to be decent to children whom you despised ? Who , when you lost the game and incurred the silent wrath and contempt of Dad , took you into her arms and said s'he loved you ? Who could possibly be more liberal than that ? old lady lay face up on the dank cellar floor , stunned and dizzy . A Sunday afternoon and she had been fixing pot roast and potatoes in the kitchen and then ? it all happened so fast : the sudden blows from her two sons , the long terrible fall backwards down the steps like in a nightmare , her hands grasping for the railing as she slid half sideways and then turned a complete somersault and banged headfirst on the concrete . She could n't see . Her neck felt as if it might be broken , and also her right wrist . She could taste blood . There seemed to be a loose tooth in her mouth . Her head started to pulse with pain . She lifted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and something wet . A radio was playing upstairs . She could hear loud breathing . Her dress was gathered up above her knees and as she tried to straighten it she saw , standing in the light at the top of the stairs , arm in arm , Ron and George , laughing . " Guess we showed you ! " She raised her head . What had she said to make them so angry ? She certainly was sorry , whatever it was . Had she been too hard on them about how they ought to attend church ? Had she nagged them too often about doing their homework and their Boy Scout projects ? She did n't mean to be a burden or a scold . She moved her lips , Ronnie , George , but no sound came out . She struggled to her knees . George took two steps down and spat at her . " Ptew . Guess you learned a lesson ! Guess you wo n't be buttin ' inna my bidness , Ma ! Huh , Ron ? Guess you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ! " The pain in her head was deafen . ing , and the words would n't come out . 0 my dear boys forgive me for provoking you to anger . But no matter what you do -- -if you kill me and throw my body in a ditch and rip out my heart , remember that with the last beat of my heart I will always love you . A liberal 's love can never be less . Never , no matter what you do . " Kinda weak on defense , ai n't ya , Ma ? Ha ha ha . " With the last ounce of strength in her battered aching body , she hoisted herself to her feet and stared up at the tall laconic young men in the light . " Mother ! Your dress ! " She looked down and saw that her blue knit dress had fallen down in a heap around her ankles , leaving her clad in a black spandex bodysuit she did n't know she possessed and also a pair of black knee-high steel-toe kangaroo combat boots with white laces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not in a bun like she usually wore it , and in her right hand she held a long riding crop . Across her bosom were silver-lame letters two inches high that spelled ONE HELLUVA WOMAN . " Mother ? " " Do n't say another word , " she said , " or I 'll bust your heads . " " Mom ? " She placed her right foot on the first stair , keeping her weight nicely balanced , her eyes fastened on George as he shrank back whimpering . She shook her head slowly and smiled and licked her lips . " Liberal , " she said . " I 'm going to liberate you boys from ignorance or die in the attempt . " She grabbed both banisters and rocked up and down on the balls of her feet , and took three long deep breaths , and sprang like a tiger , her hairy arms outstretched , her eyes burning bright red , and the sound she made deep in her throat was one they had never ever heard before .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
