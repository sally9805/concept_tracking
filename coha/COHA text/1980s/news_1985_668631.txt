Larry Bird ' s shots were flying off in all different directions . Kevin McHale and Robert Parish were being neutralized inside . The world champion Boston Celtics were in a world of trouble . That ' s when Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge came up with a better idea . They took matters into their own hands and shot the Celtics to a 106-98 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Tuesday night in Boston Garden . It left Boston with a 2-0 lead in the best-of seven Eastern Conference final that resumes in Philadelphia Saturday . " We came in at halftime and knew we had been playing good defense , " said Johnson about Boston ' s 52-46 deficit . " Our offense ( 38 percent shooting ) had just been , how do you say it , sporadic . " " ( Boston coach ) K.C. Jones called it ugly , " said one member of the media horde engulfing Johnson . " Well , okay , it was ugly . We weren ' t taking our time . The ball would go inside and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Johnson . " In the second half , we began passing the ball back outside and Danny and I weren ' t so hesitant about taking the shots . " With 5 minutes left in the third quarter , Bird scored to give Boston a 64-63 lead , and an advantage it would never relinquish . Philly ' s game plan after losing Game 1 to Boston ' s fearsome inside game was to pack it in and dare Johnson and Ainge to beat them from the perimeter . Every time Bird got some ideas of the same , Julius Erving or someone would climb all over him . " The scouting reports on us are to make Larry put the ball on the court , " said Jones . " Everyone knows he is our best outside shooter . If you make him drive and take away his shot , you can beat us . " Teams are so concerned with Larry that they forget about everyone else . " But this Bird never forgets . He is constantly aware of every one of his teammates ' movements , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open Celtic . This was never more evident than in the fourth quarter when , surrounded by three 76ers , Bird kept pivoting around and finally hit Ainge with a perfect feed for a layup . It gave Boston a 98-89 lead and so inspired the capacity crowd of 14 , 890 that the fans gave their team a 2-minute standing ovation as Philly called timeout . Whether Bird was ailing from his right elbow injury wasn ' t known because he is the kind of athlete who keeps such things to himself . In this day and age of the spoiled , pampered athlete , Bird is a throwback . He only made 8-of-23 shots , yet still led all scorers with 24 points . He hit 8-of-9 free throws , grabbed 8 rebounds and handed out 7 assists . In the critical third quarter when Boston came from six down to lead 78-70 going into the final 12 minutes , McHale seemed to be Bird ' s personal saviour . Time and again , when another Bird shot would glance harmlessly off the rim , McHale would gobble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , 11 rebounds and 5 blocked shots . Johnson contributed 22 points and 7 assists and limited one of the league ' s best shooters , Andrew Toney , to 7 points on 3-of-17 shooting . Ainge added 16 points and Parish 13 points and a game-high 16 rebounds . " I didn ' t do anything against Toney , " Johnson said . " You don ' t defense a guy like that . You just come in hoping he ' s going to have a bad night . I ask for a lot of help when I ' m out there . I ' m not guarding Andrew by myself . " CAPTION : PHOTO : AP Laserphoto .
