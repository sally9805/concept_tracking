By Sterling G. Slappey ASHINGTON - Driving down Capitol Hill you pass the Sam Rayburn House Office Building , unquestionably one of the ugliest buildings in Washington , and indeed the world . Along Pennsylvania avenue you pass the new FBI Building , Rayburn ' s worthy rival . Out on C Street you reach the State Department building which rounds out the unholy trinity of architecture . But don ' t stop there . Catch the elevator to the top floor and you enter another world , of beauty , high taste and history - the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the Department of State . The nine rooms strung together like a lovely necklace on an ugly lady ' s neck are acknowledged to be among the most beautiful in North America . The John Quincy Adams Room is widely believed to be supreme . What is more , it costs not a penny to tour the rooms . To see the rooms , simply write Department of State Tour Office , Washington , D.C. 20520 , or telephone ( 202 ) 632-3241 . Agree on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be welcome . Tours of 45 minutes are conducted by knowledgeable ladies . Your hosts will be Secretary of State Alexander Haig and Clement E. Conger , although most likely you won ' t see either . Secretary Haig will be away putting down foreign policy uprisings and Clem Conger will be lecturing or hardcharging another multimillionaire into donating some portrait or some fabulous piece of furniture , silver or china to the State Department . Whenever Mr. Conger can ' t fast talk a donor out of a valuable and historic item for the State collection , he will be delighted to accept cash donations instead . Clem Conger , six feet tall , slender and bold for 69 , officially is curator , and since 1970 when President Richard Nixon talked him into the job , he has been White House curator as well . He is often called " Curator for a Nation , " " Grand Acquisitor , " " Great Extortionist , " " World ' s Most Charming Arm Twister , " " Oriental Rug Merchant , " " Horse Trader " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia gentleman , behaving as such and with the pedigee to prove it . That he is good at collecting antiques for Uncle Sam is obvious the moment you step from the elevator after having passed the horrors of Rayburn , FBI and State . You step onto elegant , black and white squares of marble which , until Mr. Conger found them , had lain for years in a barnyard near the town of King of Prussia , Pa . The quarry is worked out , no more will ever be available . From that moment on American and foreign visitors move among magnificence that has taken 21 years to assemble . In 1961 Mr. Conger was deputy chief of protocol at State . Diplomatic Reception Rooms were airport gothic , filled with hotel Hepplewhite , Annie ' s Queen Anne , chipped imitation Chippendale and GI nothings , complete with scuffing . Mrs. Christian Herter , wife of the then secretary of state , asked Mr. Conger what he could do to make the place look better for the nextday visit of Queen Frederika of Greece and for later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolios . Conger knew fine things and where to find them . He also knew rich people and how to get at their pocketbooks , or at their heirloom . Time was too short to do much before Frederika ' s visit , but since that time Mr. Conger has made Uncle Sam more presentable by buying items valued at $30 million . Cost to Uncle Sam ? Nothing . Everything has come on donation , bought with donated funds or loaned to State . From that King of Prussia marble and elegant elevator paneling that once covered bare boarding and plaster , visitors wind among rooms , five of which are named for Secretaries of State who became President-John Quincy Adams , Thomas Jefferson , James Monroe , James Madison and Martin Van Buren . Although Benjamin Franklin never held either position , he is honored with a room . Names have not been given other rooms . That " Most Beautiful of all Rooms " - the 72 feet by 31 feet John Quincy Adams Room-is wall-to-wall with national treasures . Three superb examples : an English Sheraton tambour desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 3 , 1783 ending the American Revolutionary War ; an architectural style stand-up table desk of mahogany which belonged to Thomas Jefferson and used in his apartment at 7th and Market streets , Philadelphia , to write portions of the Declaration of Independence ; an unfinished group portrait by the 18th century American master , Benjamin West . The painting was to have shown the signing of the Preliminary Articles of Peace between the US and Great Britain in 1782 . West depicts the commissioners-John Jay , John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Henry Laurens and Commission Secretary W. Temple Franklin . West intended to paint in the British commissioner and secretary , but they never showed up . They had signed away half of the North American continent and obviously did not choose to appear . Values can not be fixed on those three irreplaceable items . Another of inestimable value in the John Quincy Adams Room is a chair used by so many Presidents that the count is lost . What may be most valuable dollar wise in any room is a Chippendale mahogany block and shell desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsman , John Townsend . The desk is worth $500,000 . " We have at least 10 other pieces worth $250,000 or more each , " Mr. Conger says . " To keep the collecting going properly I have to have on hand in the bank about $250,000 at all times so I can move fast to make acquisitions when I hear of something good coming on the market . " We get outright gifts of most desirable items each year but , unfortunately , we don ' t always get the items we want . We have to go after those by using stand-by funds and powers of persusion . We appeal to would-be donors with reminders that gifts are tax deductible and patriotism , national and family pride are involved in having their treasures at State . Hard times help us get valuable acquisitions because owners become short of money and sell to us . Closings of great houses are useful occasions . And , some people want their treasures in safe places during these days of crime . " Where ' s a safer place than the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes in the hard sell approach and he will not hesitate to suggest that you change your will so he can get your treasures after you pass on . He quickly admits that he will-to get what he wants- " Wait long while , beg , borrow-I ' ll do anything but steal . " This attitude of never-say-die has brought in such fabulous things as : a collection of chairs that belonged to Francis Scott Key ; Martha Washington ' s china and George ' s silver ; a lowboy that belonged to John Alden ; a secretary owned by John Hancock ; Jefferson ' s porcelain ; scores of portraits of early leaders painted by America ' s finest artists and thousands of other historic and lovely items . An example of fast pursuit of finery while having the money on hand with which to operate came last year when three oil paintings done in 1845 for King Louis Philippe of France suddenly came on the market in Paris . The painter was Prosper-George Antoine Marilhat . The oils , of Baltimore Harbor and two of the Great Falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Marilhat at the time of Louis Philippe ' s North American visit . Clem Conger says he heard from " one of my international art spies tha paintings were on the market , so I rushed over $90,000 from my uncommittedfunds to buy all three . A true bargain . " What may be the best bargain of all was the $6500 he paid several years ago for a portrait of Chief Justice John Marshall . " It ' s worth at least $50,000 now , " Mr. Conger says . Another bargain was an inexpensive Conger purchase of a poorly drawn , cheaply printed picture of the Boston Massacre . When first mass produced over 200 years ago , the picture sold for a penny . Today , it is worth $45,000 . Mr. Conger keeps a list of items on loan from owners which he would like to buy . About one-third of everything in the State collection is in this category , with the remaining two-thirds actually owned by State . One item on loan that Conger covets is a painting of Boston Harbor more than 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I ' ll get it yet . " When touring the rooms everyone is dead serious until Mr. Conger or a docent brings a group before a large 1803 painting , entitled " The Landing of the Pilgrims . " It amuses everyone that the French artist , Michele Felice Corne , wasn ' t checked out in history because he painted in English soldiers in naval uniforms of the late 18th century , a ship totally unlike the Mayflower , Indians watching from the hilly shoreline , a huge Plymouth Rock and a man on shore helping direct the vessel in . Visitors are quickly told that actually , the Massachusetts shoreline is more or less flat , Indians were not waiting on shore , certainly no 18th century Royal Navy men were aboard , the ship was not the Mayflower and Plymouth Rock is not large . Many times in the early days of collecting , Clem Conger either had no money or practically none . For several early acquisitions he had to borrow $10,000 . The items included are now worth $100,000 . As guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison Room before one of Clem Conger ' s favorites-a small , alabaster bas- relief of President Madison by the Italian master , Giuseppe Ceracchi . The bas-relief was rescued by Dolly Madison in 1814 when the British set fire to the White House . Early American antiques-furniture , table items , paintings-are certainly not as plentiful as English and French antiques . Three reasons : There never were very many American antiques to begin with ; over the years fires have devoured many pieces , and thirdly , precious pieces have often found their way abroad . Mr. Conger has located pieces as far away as Buenos Aires , Nova Scotia , Dublin , and London . Much fine early American furniture was made in Philadelphia , then the largest and richest city in the colonies . Pressing Philadelphia for leadership in magnificent cabinet and furniture making were artisans in Rhode Island , Massachusetts , New York and New Hampshire . Their work proves beyond doubt that early American artisans , few as they may have been , were the equal of anyone in London or Paris . These days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personlly does , Mr. Conger usually gets in the line : " Your European ancestors hardly believed such beautiful work could be done out in the wilds of North America . But , there it is , my friends . Look at it . " During the usual year , 100,000 foreigners and Americans do look closely , including 60,000 official guests of the government who view the magnificence while having a reception drink or attending a State banquet . Such heavy foot traffic , banqueting , drinking , celebrating , and just plain looking , make the Diplomatic Rooms a museum , of course . But , because the rooms are put to far greater use than just to look at , as in most other museums , these rooms are not static . They are useful , living , changing , functioning and they easily comprise the best free show in Washington . Sterling G. Slappey is a freelance writer from Virginia . B07831297
