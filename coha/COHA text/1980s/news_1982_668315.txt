Play it again , Sam . Play it again and again and again . For all the myth and hype of the National Football League was justified yesterday afternoon in a truly classic game that ended in truly classic style with a truly classic touchdown . Play this one again and again , for rarely , if ever , will you see one better . And it was only fitting that this game of style was played out in San Francisco , the city of style , just as it was fitting that it was the young , courageous , rambunctious 49ers who toppled the lordly Cowboys from their throne as America ' s Team in the final five minutes with an 89-yard drive that was pure perfection . It was a one-point game , a game that will be listed as a 28-27 win for the 49ers before a mad throng of 60,525 at Candlestick Park , but it was so much more . It was San Francisco ' s first NFC championship , the 49ers ' first championship of any kind , but never mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , will be in the Super Bowl against the AFC champion Bengals . That ' s two weeks from now ; let ' s just enjoy the beauty of yesterday . There was so much . Start with the winning touchdown , a 6-yard pass from Joe Montana to Dwight Clark with 51 seconds left in the game , a play that was first broken in pieces but finally came together in a classic football Renoir . Montana , besieged and hounded by Too Tall Jones , Harvey Martin and D.D . Lewis toward the right sideine , threw a pass that was headed for Sausalito . As the pass went up , San Francisco wide receiver Freddie Solomon was shouting to Clark , the 49er nearest the ball , " Pleeease catch the ball . Puh- leeze catch it . " At the rear edge of the end zone , Clark went up - some say two feet , some say three feet - and R.C. Owens never alley-ooped higher nor has Dr. J skied longer than Clark did in catching the ball . " Unbelievable , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark ' s catch . " He jumped three feet off the ground . " " When I released the ball , I knew it was going to be high , " said Montana , " but I was pretty certain that Clark could catch it . But . . . I didn ' t know how high it actually was until I saw the replay in the locker room . " The ball was so high , said Clark , " that it was either going to be caught by me or it was going to be incomplete . I just had to go up and get it . " After the score , though , the melodrama wasn ' t over . The Cowboys took over on their 25-yard line with 44 seconds left , and Dallas QB Danny White hit Preston Pearson with a 31-yard rope to the Niner 44- yard line . Thirty-eight seconds remained , but on the next play , San Francisco ' s Lawrence Pillers bulldozed Cowboy guard Kurt Peterson , crashed White , and the ball popped loose to the 49ers ' Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining about the fumble ( " I was throwing out to the flat to the halfback , and just as I turned to release it , I got hit ; it should have been an incompletion " ) , and Dallas coach Tom Landry took his shot at the 49ers . " The 49ers aren ' t a better team than us , " said Landry , " but the game ended at the right time for them . Montana has to be the key ; there ' s nothing else there but him . " A loser ' s lament , for as the winning TD was a catch that showcased superior talent , San Francisco ' s winning drive was a coach ' s masterpiece . San Francisco coach Bill Walsh , the master of the offense , put it bluntly but truthfully : " On that final drive , we methodically cut them apart . " The 49ers zigged and zagged across the Candlestick turf for the winning score , starting from their 11-yard line with 4:54 left in the game . Mixing their plays masterfully , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computerized Cowboys by running five times for 49 yards . " The way they do everything , " said Cowboy safety Charlie Waters , " it ' s like they ' re playing in the schoolyard . They do everything . " For instance . . . On third and 4 from their 17 , the 49ers completed a 6-yard pass to Solomon . On the next play , Lenvil Elliott circled right end for 11 yards , then zipped through the left side for 7 more . A Montana pass to Earl Cooper picked up 5 more before Solomon circled left end on a wide receiver reverse for 14 more . A pass to Solomon picked up 12 , another pass to Clark gained 10 and Elliott picked up 7 yards on a second-and-10 run to the Dallas 6-yard line . In truth , the Niners deserved the game , their six turnovers notwithstanding . San Francisco outgained the Cowboys , 413 yards to 288 , Montana completed 22 of 35 passes for 286 yards and the Dallas secondary was exposed for what it was - second-rate . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco defensive end Fred Dean . " We came from behind , and that ' s what it takes to win the Super Bowl . We knew we had to stop them on the final drive , and we did . The action on the field spoke louder than their ( the Cowboys ' ) words during the week . " The game was topsy-turvy after the 49ers cut through the Cowboys for a 63- yard drive in the first quarter . San Francisco scored on an 8-yard passfrom Montana to Freddie Solomon in the right flat , but Dallas came back on a 44-yard field goal by Rafael Septien and a 26- yard TD pass from White to Tony Hill . But Montana eluded Dallas ' Lewis and did a Nureyev leap from Bob Breunig ' s grasp in throwing a 20-yard TD pass to Clark midway throught the second quarter for a 14-10 lead . Tony Dorsett gave the Cowboys a 17-14 lead at thebreak on a 5-yard run . After Johnny Davis ' 2-yard scoring run , the Niners were leading , 21-20 , entering the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard scoring strike after Cosbie eldued 49er linebacker Jack Youngblood , producing a 27-21 lead with 10:51 left in the game . After five minutes of scene-setting action , the 49ers then set off on their winning drive . " The last drive was typical of our entire season , " said Monaana . " We did what we had to do .
