 | firstborn , who lived for three days swallowing her milk , then flew away . Both unworldly creatures with tiny feet . Between feedings the bird slept , pulsating on its cotton bed , then waking to feed every twenty minutes , a creature bent on survival . When Bert came home that night Milly told him over and over how she 'd found it . After she finally went to sleep , Bert sat with Owl at the window watching over the tiny bird lost in its basket . " Do you think it will live ? " she asked ; but he never answered . In the morning it was still alive , though its cheep was weak . " Come on , Mommy , it 's begging for food , " prodded Milly . When Owl fed it , its nourishment seemed to go straight through it . She watched the pellet of food go down its throat through transparent tubes into its enlarged stomach , bloated like the stomachs of the starving she had seen in the camps at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed of cotton . After that , it would not swallow again . Its movements were feeble . Though Owl kept trying to feed it , the thin mixture seeped out onto its breast like the drool of sleepers . She rolled the bird over to wipe it by raising one side of the basket and then the other ; it weighed so little and its stomach was so bloated that it rolled like a marble . But it was too weak to right itself , remaining beak down in the cotton , and it never ate or cheeped again . " The bird is dead , " said Bert , angel of death , coming into the kitchen that night . Owl ran to look . In the brief time it took her to cook dinner , the bird had already begun to decompose . It had turned from pink to yellow and the cotton beneath it was wet with yellow . So fragile was its life that the dampness spread like a shadow . Owl covered it with Kleenex and returned to the kitchen . The next time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone . At the time , Owl thought Bert must have flushed it down the toilet to spare her  | the job , but she was never sure . Now , remembering how Bert had taken everything from her , she thought how easy it would be to slip quietly out of the world like the dead bird disintegrating at her feet . But she was unwilling to give him that satisfaction . At the near corner of her block , she probed for fortune in a wire-mesh trash can with an umbrella shaft . Each day held the prospect of sudden wealth . Already , trash cans of this neighborhood had yielded astonishing finds . A woman from the Shelter named Red Mary had once found a wallet stuffed with money , probably abandoned by a thief . Another acquaintance had found a new pair of leather boots he had sold for cash . Stories circulated in the park of stashes of narcotics , sterling silver candlesticks , murdered newborns ; and Owl herself had once discovered a damaged but glorious leatherbound book in which s 's looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , for someone with Owl 's keen eye , the problem was not to find but to reject . Nothing raised her higher than giving new life and love to the forsaken ; yet if she did not ruthlessly discriminate , she was in danger of being buried in the glut . With two full bags of acquisitions on her arm , she considered and rejected a broken lamp , a dirty pink comb , a rusty ice-cream scoop , and moved on to the next station on her route , pleased with her frugality . Not so long ago she had gone to Sunday church sales at the hour when the ladies gave the stuff away : all you could carry for the price of the bus fare . But now she tried to be selective , knowing that once she adopted a discard , redeeming it through love , it became dangerously part of her . Every loss was like a little death . She remembered the priceless treasures she had lost already  --  the beautiful Balinese painting of a hundred dancing figures with golden peaked helmets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from the war . She had placed it carefully , in its cardboard sleeve , behind a chest of drawers ; but when she packed to move it was gone ?  | thrown out , she assumed ; found by someone else , she hoped . A mosaic butterfly pin from Florence , Italy , fallen from her clothes . An old book of fables she had let fall as she dozed , with the picture of the black fox ever reaching for the grapes . Gone , all gone , some lost for fifty years ; gone as if to the bottom of the sea where lost treasures go . Her last stop was the alley to feed her cats . This time as Owl arrived at the fence , not all her cats leaped to welcome her . Ignoring their daily ration of dry cat food which Owl purchased each fortnight out of her welfare check , the largest tom in the colony , a ragged calico missing part of an ear , and several other long-term residents raced around in a frenzy of excitement over some large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pounced upon , and shook rapidly in their jaws like wild animals . At first Owl thought they must have killed a rat . She had often seen rats in the area : dead in the hotel courtyard , alive in the park , once running boldly across a side street in the middle of the night and now and then in an underground passage . But as the big tom , racing forward with the prey in his mouth , skidded past her chased by the others , she recognized a wing hanging down from a bloody body . Two dead birds in a day : a bad omen . " For shame ! " she cried , forgetting nature ; then , switching tactics , she tried to believe the bird had been dead when the cats found it , for there were corpses everywhere . But she knew there were also wounded birds and sick ones in the streets , perfect prey for alley cats . She had seen them in the park , wings immobile , hiding in bushes and under benches , or dragging themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets where they puffed up their feathers and waited alone to heal . Once she had found an injured pigeon , left for dead in a trash can or tossed there to die . She had carried it to the park and hidden it , surrounded by bread , in a  | hedge . The next day it was gone . She chose to believe it had flown away , but even so , she tried not to think about that bird , vulnerable to every carnivore . She knew the cats were driven , like everyone , by more than hunger ; still , she tried to divert them from their bloody pursuits by pushing morsels of food under the fence until all she had was gone . As best she could , she watched the kittens eat , ignoring the tom still tearing at the bird . There was a reason to all this , she assured herself ; there was a reason for everything . But as she left the alley for the Hotel Venus she could not remember what it was . Prince ambled into the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet Robin . The place revolted him . Broken chairs and fixtures , wrappers on the floor , peeling paint , and in the air the sickly sweet smell of disinfectant , the same smell that filled the peep shows where as a porter he had scrubbed down the viewing booths several times a night to get the jism off the walls . In contrast , Prince was showered , shaved , perfumed , shined . It did n't take much to make yourself presentable . Growing up in Washington , he remembered garbage in the halls and even rats in the basements of all the houses he had lived in ; yet his mother had managed to keep their own apartments spotless . Instead of English , she spoke cleanliness . After working eleven hours in a shop , she came home to clean . ( For the day his father returned , she said  --  though he had n't been seen since his unit left Manila when she was five months pregnant with Prince . ) He could barely remember a kitchen floor without a newspaper covering to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the training ship after he 'd joined the navy gleamed like his mother 's kitchen floor . Prince lit a cigarette and checked his watch . So far , every-  | thing had gone according to plan , but certain problems would have to be dealt with . The friend Boots was one : if she turned up , he 'd have to catch her too . The runaway habit was worse : he 'd have to turn that around if he wanted to lock the bitch . At least she was n't a junkie . But there was still plenty about her he did n't know . Some players skimped when they took an application from a ho , but Prince knew the importance of a complete record . According to the pimping code , every little fact had to be put to use . Otherwise , you might catch your girl but fail to lock her , or lock her up but train her wrong . The rules were all there for a reason . With so few chicks coming through anymore , you could n't leave anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in the service with that check coming every month , he 'd had plenty of women . They swarmed around him , ogling the uniform , admiring the tattoos , fingering the cash . He 'd had enough for everything then , even a wife and son . But when he got out he blew them all : checks , women , wife , son . Back on the street with no job and no money , he could n't even buy a woman a drink . When his wife took him to court for alimony , he left Washington for New York and changed his name to Prince . At twenty-two , unable to use his real name , the only square jobs he could land were porter in a peep show or straight messenger boy . What did he care ? He was young and good-looking . He hung out on the street and in the sailors ' bars , admiring the players ' craft , eager to be a runner , a hustler for anyone with cash . But pimping never crossed his mind . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moneymaking talent if he 'd only use it : his way with women . Prince had merely laughed . He was so broke , he said , that if he took a woman for a beer he would n't be able to pay . " Pay ? " said Clem . " Tricks pay . Pimps get paid . Which one you want to be ? " Then one night an ex-dancer named Alma put him in a pimping position , and by the following week he had to admit  | Clem was right . He did have something of a talent . Shaky from his battles with his wife , he 'd been slow to respond to Alma . She was a slender , delicate woman , much older than he , with maple-brown skin , soft heavy-lidded eyes , a pretty face marred by a mysterious scar , firm small breasts , and a slight limp , but one of the best-loved hookers on the stroll . For some reason he did n't understand , she attached herself to him , sitting in a booth at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her touching but felt awkward without money . She stirred him by painting pitiful scenes of her life : a hip injury that had finished her for dancing , a man who beat her , another who left her , a baby abandoned , a second child sick . . . . Listening to Alma talk , Prince was unaware that she was submitting her application to be his ho . Not even when she pressed into his hands a small purse containing a thousand dollars and a promise of that much more each week if he would be her man , did he know what she was offering . At twenty-two , fresh from the service , he lacked imagination . He thought Alma had simply been scared someone would rob her . He 'd never heard of " choosing money , " much less a thousand dollars of it . He did n't even know that a ho chooses her man , not a man his ho . He certainly did n't dream that she was choosing him . And when , half out of pity , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her later , he had no idea he had taken the job of pimp . But as Alma continued to present him each week with more money than he 'd ever made , he began to appreciate his talent . Alma might be trouble and getting old ; but how could you beat two hundred dollars a night just to be there listening and now and then give up a little dick ? It was as if he had been handed a treasure map in a difficult code , and then a key to the code . All he had to do was read the map , dig , and pick up the gold . He started learning the names of things all over again . Bad meant good . Alma in love was eager to front off her young Prince . When  | she learned he was part Filipino , she bought him a purple silk kimono ( " to go with your eyes " ) . She dressed him in elegant clothes , gave him a diamond ring , and introduced him to everyone she thought might help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Alma 's , undertook to school him , even though Prince was n't black . " I 'll do what I can , " he told Alma , appraising Prince . " Maybe he 'll get the style down , but he ai n't got the blood . " Nevertheless , he taught Prince threecard monte and the murphy game , where a shill who looked like Prince could be a real asset , and gave him his own copy of Iceberg Slim 's famous memoirs to read . He talked game with him at every chance , lectured him on the pimping code , instilled contempt for the small-time popcorns and respect for the real boss players , those beautiful , legendary black men known all over the east for their furs and suedes and eyeturning women and long custom cars whose names ( Eldorado Eddie , Mark V ) they took for themselves . At last Robin emerged from the elevator . Prince jumped to his feet and donned his Mr. Reliable smile . Fifteen minutes early : could she have been planning to sneak off before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared . She probably just did n't know the time . First thing he 'd buy her was a watch . Her face lit up as she spotted him . " Mornin , Robin , " he said , walking over and taking her arm like a longtime friend . " You 're here . " " Well , sure I 'm here . Did n't I say I 'd be ? " She was holding on to his arm like someone up a tall , shaky tree holding on to the trunk . The way she was giving up rhythm , he figured he could probably have her right there and then , but he was going to play this one carefully . She needed reassurance more than dick . He held her hand up close against his ribs and steered her toward a diner , allowing no space for doubts . " How 'd you like  | to call up your friend and ask her to meet us for breakfast ? " he asked . If she said yes , he 'd be able to see who he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she said no , then either there was no friend , or Robin preferred him to her at the moment . Either way , he 'd score a point of confidence , showing her he had nothing to hide . " No , that 's okay , I 'll try her again tonight . She may be sleeping . " Her answer was cool , but Prince could see his suggestion upset her . He filed the fact away for the day he might need it and ordered them donuts and coffee . " So tell me , pretty lady , how 'd you sleep ? " She shrugged . " It was noisy . Kinda scared me . I have to get used to the city , I guess . " He took her hands while she told him of her terrors , and leaning close to her , he said at last , " You know , baby , you do n't have to stay at the Moon . You can stay with me if you choose to . " She inhaled sharply , as if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her reply , holding her in an eyelock , hoping to disarm her with directness . " Are n't you going away tonight , though ? " she stalled . " Not till tomorrow . Tomorrow I got to leave you alone . So you better hang on to this till I get back . " He slid the satin treasure bag across the table , watching her closely . Good timing , he thought , feeling her relax . Timing was everything . It felt like the moment in three-card monte when the bets go down . First your partner 's bet and then the mark 's . Returning the satin bag was the partner 's bet . And now he waited for the mark 's . She picked up the case and tucked it into her shoulder bag . " But how come you 'll let me stay with you ? " she asked , stalling or fishing , he was n't sure which .  | " Where else you gon na stay ? " " But how come ? " " How come ? You got to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want to see you on your feet , I got to have a special reason besides ? " He withdrew his hands from hers and let his mouth form a pout , then waited to see the regret in her eyes before he finally gave her what she wanted . " Maybe I just like you . That 's how come . " Her pleasure spread over her face . He was sure she would take the bet . ( When she was his , he 'd have to teach her how to hide her feelings , he thought , jumping ahead . ) He paid for their breakfasts and said nothing more about where she 'd sleep , allowing her to think the decision was hers . But when he set out to show her the town , tucking her hand back under his arm , he could tell by the way she leaned on him that the first round belonged to him .  | Even before she opened her eyes , the whines of small children , a radio through the wall , the smell of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peepers , no surf ; still , day : city day . She had been dreaming about the island . About Bruce Stockton from outside Newton , Mass. , whose family had rented a beach house on the island for the month of August of the summer between her eighth and ninth grades and to whom she 'd lost her virginity . It was just before high school , after she 'd started to get breasts . They 'd been good friends that summer , so naturally they spent the night before he left lying around on the beach , drinking Cokes , listening to the local rock station on his portable radio , looking up at the stars and the Northern Lights , and it had just " happened . " It was the last thing she 'd expected , for she was not like the others , the popular crowd , she never ran after boys , she was a tomboy type , despite her uninvited breasts ; why , she 'd never seriously even kissed a boy before . But people talked about it so much , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , so that when it did happen it seemed natural , and she did n't understand why people made so much fuss about it . She opened her eyes cautiously , but the dream disappeared . Here she lay , stretched out in a well-used bed , still wearing the bikini underpants and the yellow T-shirt that said " Born to Dance . " It was the bed Prince had tucked her into after buying her drinks in two more spots and taking her for a big dinner of Chinese food , food she 'd never eaten before . Across the room lay yesterday 's clothes in a heap beside her backpack . Where was Prince ? They 'd slept in the same bed ?  | she remembered the strange tattoos on his chest and arms , a moon over a palm tree  --  but without touching . She 'd certainly been willing after all his kindness  --  she 'd done it with others for less  --  but he 'd gone out before she woke up . She sat up and looked around . Dusty light and steady traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . A leopard fur rug and gay print pillows gave an air of decoration to the otherwise plain room . But even the drab beige sofa , chest of drawers , several shiny lamps , and simple chairs seemed elegant after the awful Moon . Slowly the night came back to her : the doors on her left led to a bathroom and a closet , and a short corridor across the room led to a tiny compact kitchen where Prince had mixed them their last drinks and toasted her , looking deep into her eyes . She reached over and fiddled with the clock-radio dial till she found her own music . The clock read 12:42 ; she 'd already slept away half the day ! Quickly she scrambled out of bed , stopping for clean clothes and shampoo from her pack , then headed straight for the shower . The water , responding to her every whim , came bubbling forth , hot or cold , in a soft steady stream . It filled up an entire little room lined in patterns of pink tile , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not like the hand-held showers on the island . ( Prince said Manhattan was an island too , but she did n't believe it . ) When she was clean and dry , she put on a fresh T-shirt and a clean pair of jeans , brushed her long wet hair and her teeth , and then , pulling a chair over to the window where she could dry her hair in the sun , snapped up the shade on the strange city . There was a great bustle of activity in the street below , like the chattering and feeding of a thousand birds . Pedestrians rushed by , horns bellowed without letup , in the alley across the street cats cried like gulls . Her father would have cursed them if he were sober , pelted them if he were drunk . But instead ,  | they were being offered scraps of food from a ragged shopping bag by an old woman dressed like a witch . Robin smiled as she realized her father was hundreds of miles away and would never be able to find her . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature too small for its pelt with ungainly white paws , a white muzzle , and large bewildered eyes , lost in the world . No native , Owl was sure . Without visible connection in the alley , it had probably been newly exiled from some human family ? another tossaway . It had not rushed to greet Owl like the others when she arrived with their food but had hung back bewildered . Neither did it eat when the others ate . Remembering the kittens she had ignored , the starving cats of Europe she had failed to notice in her wild youth , all the creatures she had once in her ignorance passed callously by , Owl sucked air through her missing tooth at this cowering kitten and held out her hand , her heart . It did not move . But noting that it did not flee either , Owl allowed herself the luxury of pity that felt like love . Her bosom swelled , her heart lifted , and , like that impulsive girl she once had been who knew how to give herself to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity , she pulled the kitten under the fence and lifted it to her cheek . The first kitten she 'd loved she 'd got for Milly because Bert , who hated cats , had left them . For months after he 'd gone Milly would climb into Owl 's big half-empty bed each morning and cry . " Where 's Daddy ? " " He 's in California . " " When 's he coming home ? " " I do n't know , darling . "  | " I want him to come home now . " " I know , I know , " soothed Owl , stroking her child 's fine yellow hair . She tried to be strong , though she was griefstricken ; when Milly cried Owl had to console her . Still , she did n't know what to say . Should she tell Milly the truth about her father ? Or should she cover for him to spare Milly pain ? For a while she wanted to keep everything as it was before Bert left , on the chance that he might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . Instead , he sent a large plastic present , some kind of game too old for her . Placing it with her own presents to Milly beneath the small tree she had decorated ( what a bleak ceremony , opening presents for two ) , Owl resolved not to wait anymore . ' When , later that day , one of the neighbor children showed Milly the kitten she 'd gotten for Christmas , Milly begged for one of her own , knowing there were still four more in the litter . Owl had never much liked cats ; she had thought attachments to pets sentimental . She had once let her fish die out of laziness and agreed with Bert that the smell of cats was distasteful . But now on an impulse she decided to take one of the kittens . For Bert , the cat hater . Now that he was gone they did n't have to cater to his objections . They were free to do whatever they wanted . The kitten they took was a tiny black and white tiger  --  a miracle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owl imagined what a joy it might be to have a kitten . The first day they had him at home she and Milly did nothing but follow him around in astonishment , observing his movements , marveling over his odd feline ways . The way he licked himself all over , beginning with his head  --  first wetting a paw and rubbing it over his ears , face , muzzle , neck , then working his way with his tongue systematically down to the tip of his tail . The way he used the litter box from the start , neatly covering every sign of soil . The way he invariably curled up on any small , flat , discrete object ?  | the page of the book Milly was reading on the floor , an envelope , a napkin . For one full day the spectacle of instinct distracted them from their pain . But that night , after they had gone to bed , the kitten whimpered continually , and Owl could not sleep . At the very first whimper Owl woke with a start , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't respond to a baby 's cry , it might not stay alive ! ) Then , once she was fully awake , painfully sensitive to the kitten 's pain , she began to think about Bert and how he had gone off to California and left them , and their wasted past  --  and when dawn came she was still awake . The next night when the kitten cried she woke again , and again she could n't get back to sleep . And the next night again , and the next . Soon she was one of those people who wake every morning at four to stalk a specter in the corner of the room . Instead of sleeping , she would lie in bed in the dark trying to sleep and rail against Bert the betrayer , giving him all her reasons , going over and over in her mind every minute detail of the quarrel between them , all their recriminations . And even after the kitten learned to be silent through the night , even after Owl understood what a privilege it was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another species ( as , later , after Milly had gone , she would know what a gift it had been to be made guardian to another human soul ) , Owl remained an early-morning waker , someone who found sleep an ordeal and faced the nights with dread . Now , feeling this new kitten against her cheek , helpless , soft , needy , she knew she would take it home . Let the manager use it against her , she had no choice : if it did n't eat , it would die . She stroked the small animal absently until she had fully accepted her new responsibility . It meant trouble , but so did everything she did . This was an emergency . Carefully she rearranged the contents of her shopping bags , moving a few  | things from the fragile Ellen to the heavier Barbara , until she had cleared enough room . She lifted the kitten by the loose pelt at its neck and lowered it in ( it belonged , like her , to a species fond of shopping bags ) and covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned tufted kind used widely for bedspreads , that she kept on hand for just such purposes . Her rounds finished , Owl proceeded home , hoping to make it to her room before the thugs and thieves were stirring . But as soon as she entered the Hotel Venus and saw a girl bound past her , gazellelike , pursued by a hunter 's murderous cries , she knew she was already too late . Cowering inside the narrow doorway with her shopping bags , Owl saw the hunter leap down the stairs advancing toward her . She tried desperately to flatten herself and her bags against the open door and let him pass , but she was no longer of a shape to flatten . On the contrary , her fate was now , perhaps forever , to stick out like a tumor , protrude like a wen . As for her bags , they had been created for no other purpose than to expand when filled and were at that moment stuffed to overflowing with the morning 's haul . " Outa my way ! " screamed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Witch ! I 'll kill you ! " Recognizing the rage , Owl hid her head in the crook of her arm before the blows began . She remembered the Peruvian painter she 'd picked up in Rome who 'd drawn her portrait in chalk on walls all over the student quarter . He had called her bewitching , a beautiful witch , and as she saw herself flat against the walls of Rome so charmingly drawn , she had agreed . But the following day while they made love in his room , the rains washed all the pictures away . Nothing remained . And soon she had had to leave the city  --  or was it he who left ? She heard a thud against her head as from a great distance and stoically steeled herself . ' When her glasses were  | dangling from one ear , the other earpiece gone , her attacker turned his wrath to her property , going at her shopping bags with alternate feet . The kitten ! She knew it would end like this . It was her bags they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse composed of a long string of epithets in five languages and the complete range of human inflection . While her enemy the manager cackled in appreciation ( but would n't stoop to help her ! ) , her astonished assailant sheathed his fists in his pockets and swaggered off , leaving Owl to try to re-collect her things . She would salvage what she could . She wanted to examine the kitten , to see if it was still alive . ( Had it escaped in the melee ? Why no sound ? ) But the manager and several residents were watching her . Smart kitten , to make no sound , she thought , moving toward the stairs with her bags . Either smart or dead . When her hair was dry and brushed , Robin pocketed the key Prince had thoughtfully left for her on the table , popped a stick of gum into her mouth , and walked down the stairs to the lobby of the Royal Arms . A cluster of men stood gossiping at the desk and did not notice her . She slipped past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like crabs in the mud flats , spilling over the curb . She looked around for a phone booth . The first one she spotted was occupied by a man shaving before a mirror hung over the dial . Sheepishly she entered the adjacent booth and dialed Boots 's number , but when the same gruff voice answered she hung up . Walking downtown , she was overwhelmed by the fierce wheeled traffic : kids on skateboards , men on roller skates ,  | women with shopping carts , only inches from death ; cars and buses attacking traffic ; enormous trucks backing up blind ; three-wheeled delivery carts pedaled by men . Sometimes when the traffic lights turned red , motorists stepped into the streets , leaving their motors running , and shook their voices and fists at one another , then returned to their cars on green and tore away . Wide-eyed , she watched it all  --  the whores and hags , the sex peddlers with their wares , the noisy , brash pedestrians . Risky , exciting ; yet whatever the dangers , she knew she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered why she had waited so long to come to this place , why anyone would stay in Maine when the city was only a day 's ride away , and why her mother , who had once had her feet underneath her , had n't just packed up her children and run away . She did n't know which had been more terrible , to see her mother slip silently into drunkenness where she would sit or lie beyond reach , or to hear her rail loudly against the pain of her bitter life . Like the time one of the summer people , enchanted by their simple hand-built house , had crossed the beach and climbed the stairs to borrow a cup of sugar . Sugar ! It was funny . Had n't anyone warned her ? She had even brought her small child with her . " Well , of course you may , " her mother said , inviting them in . It was early in the day  --  early enough for her still to be acting normal . " What a charming house , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child tentatively explored the house . " Oh , yes , " said her mother , with her cynical smile , " it 's very pretty here , " and poured sugar into the woman 's cup . She handed it to her with a strained smile , and they all walked out together to the porch . While the two women drew out their goodbyes , the child  | strayed unobserved to the very edge of the porch . No one noticed until Robin 's mother suddenly cried , " Watch him ! " and leaped to snatch the boy back . The house , built high over thorny brush , was encircled by a railing of a single board about three feet off the porch floor  --  well designed to enhance the view but far too high to protect anyone under eight years of age . As she pulled the startled child back from under the railing to safety and he began to scream , she let out a long wail of despair and spewed forth her own pent-up bitterness . " There , now ! You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I begged him to enclose this porch . At least put up another rail . And still  --  still ! ? it 's like this ! All the years of watching them , waiting for them to fall , worrying over them , while he .... " She beat her fists against the railing . " See why I hate this place ? Hate it ! I know , I know . Everyone who comes out here loves it . The magnificent view , the workmanship . How lucky you are , they say to me . Lucky ? Sure . But no one ever thinks what it means to raise three children with no railing , no water , no separate rooms , no heat . Or what it 's like just getting a meal . Sure , the pioneers did it , sure the country 's being ruined , big business , TV , welfare . But I 'm not a pioneer ! Luke  --  there 's the pioneer . Luke sacrifices , Luke provides . Now he 's going to build us a new wing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll build a wind generator , solar heating , a sauna . And my rail ? And does he bring us what we need ? He does n't even know what we need ! And when his own family are n't labor enough , he brings home his lackey , his whores . To live , when there 's hardly space for us to live ! " By the time she had finished , tears were streaming down her cheeks , and her words were incoherent . " Please , Mom , please , " whimpered Robin , mortified . But her mother did n't hear . The visitor , embarrassed , took her child and the sugar and tiptoed down the stairs . Even when they were halfway  | across the beach , Robin 's mother was still standing alone on the deck , addressing herself to the sky , shaking her fist at the sun . " Heeey , " said Prince , long and low , when Robin walked in . " Pretty girl . Like I said  --  a shower , a night 's sleep , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Yeah . My trip 's been put off . But I brought you some presents . A couple a new outfits to try on , they 'll give you a whole new personality  --  you can be anyone you want to be now , you know ? " " For me ? " He looked around . " No one else here they 're gon na fit . " He held out the packages and winked . " Well , are n't you gon na help me with this stuff ? " She stood watching him . No one had ever brought her presents . " Well ? " he repeated , still holding out the packages , cocking his head to one side . " Do n't I at least get a kiss ? " Her legs carried her across the room and her lips shaped themselves for a kiss . Prince wrapped her in his arms and dropped the packages to the floor . Robin remembered her dream of Bruce Stockton lying on top of her , but as Prince began to kiss her , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longing she could n't control . One moment she barely acknowledged the feeling , and the next moment it was filling her up , the way the tide sometimes filled the cove so suddenly that you 'd drown if you could n't swim . Prince pulled away with a friendly pat on her behind . " C'm on , " he said , piling the packages on the table . " Style em for me. "  | While Prince withdrew to the bed to watch , Robin opened the boxes , one by one . Delight lit her face . A black skirt , two pretty sleeveless tops , one red , one striped , and a pair of sheer black pantyhose , all with labels intact . As she took the skirt out of its box and began to open the zipper , she realized that to try it on she would have to remove her jeans , and for the tops she would have to take off her shirt . Overcome by embarrassment , for one agonizing moment she hesitated ; then , taking courage from the memory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed into the skirt and pulled the T-shirt quickly over her head , exposing her breasts . " Very nice , I like it , " said Prince , absorbed in the clothes . " Turn around . " She turned . " Now try the other one . " Again , she removed the top and stood exposed until the new top was on . " You look very good in an outfit like that , " he said without emotion . " You 're a natural . You do n't have to go around like a high-school dropout , you know , askin for it . " She put her own clothes back on , refolded the new ones neatly , then sat beside him on the bed , grateful and relieved that the ordeal was over . They talked till it was quite late . Finally Prince looked at his watch , yawned , and began to take off his clothes . Robin wanted to trace his strange tattoos with her fingers and ask him what they meant . But Prince had said he was done talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . When they were both under the sheet , he kissed her chastely on top of the head , ruffled her hair , turned off the light , and put his arm limply around her shoulders . She moved close to him in the dark , half wishing to go on talking , half wishing something more . In her mind she kept repeating the single  | word " please , " without knowing exactly what it was she wanted , until she fell asleep . In the morning when she opened her eyes the word was still on her lips . She felt it like a call . " What do you say ? " said Prince , greeting her cheerfully . Music was playing softly , and she smelled the strong smell of the city . " Please , " she said , " please . " He looked at her with his dark-lashed languid eyes until she " pleased " again . " If you want me to , baby , " he said . He covered her raw loneliness with a long and ardent kiss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he was lying naked beside her . With no fear of her father or of anyone , she lay in his bed , and soon he was covering her with kisses and caresses , even there between her legs . After a while a feeling she had never felt rose up in her . It began to assail her like a sudden storm , filling her with fear . She could almost hear the thunder , rumbling its distant threat , getting closer and closer . She lay very still , waiting , listening , barely able to breathe . She wanted to run for shelter before it broke , but Prince would n't let her go . He kept on with his caresses , steady , insistent , until suddenly the storm was bursting upon her , it was everywhere , pounding in her ears , stopping her heart . She was drenched and shaken . On it came , wave after wave , and no escape . Soon he was inside her , moving with the music , pressing his lips to her lips and his hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She shuddered , she cried , she could n't believe what had happened . This feeling , filling her , drenching her , sinking her down , down , down , had nothing to do with what she 'd known of sex . It frightened , it terrified her . Lying beneath him , feeling his weight upon her , she squeezed his hands as if he were a raft and could save her from her own pounding pulse . And as she  | felt his penis wither inside her , she held his hands so he would n't leave . " That what you wanted me to do , baby ? That make you feel happy ? " " Yes , " she whispered , afraid to hear her own voice speak the truth . " That 's good , baby . That 's good . All I want to do is make you happy . "  | Owl had seen Milly twice now without speaking , both yesterday and the day before ; the next time she must be ready to make contact . She must offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . She must offer her everything she had , from a kitten to a mother 's love , before she disappeared again . Seating herself on her bed , ignoring her neighbor 's cough , Owl shooed away the new kitten and carefully arranged around her her five main bags ( three that traveled with her and two that stayed home ) , preparing to take inventory for Milly 's sake . The first bag , a plain brown bag named Belle , contained the remnants of her childhood , the crumbling contents of her cedar box : her mother 's picture , her father 's postcards from the West  --  those photos of snow-covered trolleys climbing steep hills that reminded her of home , pictures of milk wagons and beer wagons pulled by large drayhorses with flowers behind their ears . She could no longer tell if the old pictures reminded her of something real she could recall or if her memories were only of the pictures , they 'd been with her so long . One picture she was sure of : a rare snapshot of their Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child Lilly on a kiddie car in the long shadow of her father the photographer . " Come on , Lilly , " she could hear him call , " we 're taking some pictures . " She remembered leaving the others , racing up the hill to where Papa stood fiddling with the Brownie . Her mother was not in the picture , but Owl felt her presence in the scene . In this same bag she also kept , miraculously , the very pin she had made for her mother in school , out of copper and wood  --  her  | last gift to her before she had died . Holding it brought back everything  --  the last Christmas , her mother 's smile , her own joy making the pin . So many steps to completion , so many pitfalls . Her own toys and jewelry were gone , but not this pin she had made for her mother . Here in this bag , named after her mother , she also kept new reminders of those days . Once she had found a discarded cache of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the piano bench at her grandmother 's house : " Bye , Bye Blackbird , " " Button Up Your Overcoat , " " Over There " ( with a picture of Caruso on the cover ) . Winter evenings with her mother and all the aunts playing their best pieces and singing in harmony in the parlor with the gas fire lit . In summer they sang a cappella on the front porch , sliding the glider back and forth in time to the music . In this bag she put scraps of oilcloth and old wallpaper that reminded her of back then and would have put , if only she still had them , the shark's-tooth necklace from her papa , the rabbit 's foot , the cocoons she 'd tried to hatch , pressed flowers from the rock garden , the silver snake ring with the green glass eye from her Aunt Hilda she had lost along the way , and her autograph book . Gone . She 'd found another autograph book like her own but not her own . The verses were familiar but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Belle . The second bag , Ellen ( Altman 's to the unknowing ) , recorded her wild youth , her beauty , her stint as a WAC , her reckless love affairs all over Europe . This bag was full of lies . Pictures of Owl with many men , pictures of young men , of soldiers . Steamer stickers , cheap souvenirs of resorts , a travel notebook with addresses of friends and long defunct restaurants in Paris and Geneva with their bygone prices that made her laugh when she read them . Precious picture postcards of Venice and Rome , maps , coded lists of lovers and near-lovers , voluptuous poems never sent , deceitful and passionate letters  | written in dark blue ink on light blue mailgrams , every usable corner consumed , including copies of two love letters from a now famous poet , the originals of which she had sold to a collector some years back , proud letters home from around the world saved for her by her Aunt Hilda . Lies . Lies . And what had she left of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The taste of absinthe , the blue of ski slopes rushing past ( on a forty-eight-hour pass ) , an endless train whistle , feel of featherbed , the warm body of Jay nestled against her , Voice of America . A headful of stories and no one to tell , a souvenir packet in her shopping bag . Here too she kept her honorable discharge , a yellowed letter from the colonel To whom it may concern , and her postwar passport . The Barbara bag into which the kitten had climbed held the truth of her life . Sturdy plastic bag printed with ugly pink flowers . Owl removed the kitten by the scruff of his neck and peered inside . To look at the bag , who would guess it contained the essence of her marriage ? Actually , her second marriage . Her first , her foolish marriage , did n't count . She remembered the name , the wedding , the clothes , the too-high voice of her husband ; otherwise , that time was all but lost to her . Was there a honeymoon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she thought of her first husband she saw not his face but the bowl of his cherrywood pipe , carved like a head , on a curved amber neck . Otherwise , blank  --  though she remembered thinking him quite handsome when they met . He 'd had a shrill accusing voice which kept her guilty and a forced laugh she came to dread . Now he 's going to make that laugh , she 'd predict , and he would . Their life ? Her days of wedlock were spent in the same office she 'd worked in before him and again after him . She remembered the office better than she remembered him . The liaisons , the politics , her dark oak desk , certain conversations at coffee break  --  Mary B. the Marxist saying she would never invest in the stock market and  | support the system and Norman suggesting that if she felt that strongly about it then she could always sell short ; the would-be actresses in the typing pool . But of their homelife she remembered chiefly the apartment , the kitchenette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chops ( 49 ? a lb . ) , Tuesday chicken ( 390 ) , Wednesday beef ( 790 ) , Thursday a casserole , Friday fish ( 390 ) , weekends open . A few stories , a few jokes ; otherwise , of her first , her childless , marriage , she remembered almost nothing . She 'd heard from a neighbor in their building that her husband had remarried almost at once and that his new wife wore Owl 's abandoned clothes . This knowledge somehow relieved her of guilt , as if he considered her and her successor interchangeable . After that , though she had worn his name for several years , she almost never thought of her first husband . But her second husband , that one , she never stopped thinking about . She needed a truck , a warehouse , not a shopping bag . Fifteen years building a nest , making room in the closets , rocking in that rocking chair , cooking , making peace , squabbling , soothing , packing , unpacking . Even now , still , remembering him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick if she let it . An office romance ! She should have known the signs ; why had n't she seen ? Finding lipstick on the collar when she did the wash  --  could n't he have spared her that ? Who did he think did the wash ? Fifteen years wasted . Sometimes she thought it was wrong to keep Milly 's things in the same bag with his even separated by a box of their own ( Milly 's baby teeth , Milly 's class pictures , Milly 's Music Prize , Milly 's valentines and drawings and poems ) . If only he had n't married that bitch . Things were all right till he remarried . He 'd left Owl once and come back ; why not again ? She 'd told him he did n't have to marry the bitch , but he was worried about the scandal . Why did he go and marry and take Milly away ? It was in this bag that Owl kept her wedding pictures , the footprint of the boy , the divorce decree from Mexico gaudily sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't she strangled him with those ribbons ? ) , her precious instruments of revenge . Here she kept the lawyers ' documents , the intercepted letters from her to Bert and from Bert to her , including one retrieved in pieces from the wastebasket and carefully pieced together ( where Owl read the awful name the lovebirds called her ) , one stolen from his wallet along with a picture of them taken on a street where palm trees grew . And the lipstick ( Devil Dance ) she 'd found in the car , and the calendar she 'd kept that year she discovered them , on which she 'd noted the exact time he came home each night . ( And still , despite the evidence , she 'd believed his story . ) Besides the original evidence , she had newspaper accounts of similar cases , Supreme Court citations , stories and poems that nailed him , her own letters to Bert . She knew she had an airtight case against him . When she filed her suit he would have to answer for ten separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise , incarceration , lies and perjury , false witness , assault , kidnapping , fraud , and deceit ! And the damages  --  how could she assess them ? A million dollars at least . Not for herself ; she could live on bitterness alone ; she wanted them for Milly . This time she would tell Milly all . No longer would she try to protect her from the knowledge of her father 's cruelty . She was old enough now to know the truth . And when she won her suit for pain and damages she would have a million to leave to Milly , and not one penny for Bert . Sister Theresa had once said , " You 're still pretty angry at him , are n't you , Owl ? " But Sister Theresa had been wrong . " Angry ? " Owl had replied . " No , I 'm not angry . I loathe him . I hope he roasts in hell ! " The fourth bag ( really , two bags , a sturdy brown paper one inside a water-proof plastic one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to passersby ) , commenced after the divorce . It held necessities , all the things she might suddenly need . Welfare forms , elastic bandages , spare bags large and small , flashlight , scissors and knife , paper and pens , a bankbook with a balance of  | $236.57 plus interest , a bit of cash , medicine , tape , eating utensils , including her precious fish knife . She held up the fish knife with pride and wondered again , for the hundredth time , whether it belonged here in the Susan among the other eating utensils or in the Ellen with her souvenirs . Heavy , broad , fiat , blunt-bladed silver knife , beautifully shaped , ornately monogrammed with the initials of that unpronounceable inn where the colonel had taken her , it belonged in the Ellen . But if she was not to use it for fish , then it would be only a remnant of the past and like so much of the intricate knowledge she had acquired in her years , wasted . Waste of any kind distressed and saddened her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort her possessions once and for all . She turned over the fish knife and thought how much she wanted to give it to Milly , who had years ahead of eating fish , whereas she , Owl , with no place to cook , might never get to use it again . I could get a fish from the market and broil it over a trashcan fire , but if I tried to use my fish knife it would be stolen as soon as I looked away . Maybe I should keep it in the Ellen after all , with all the other things I have to thank the colonel for , because never again will I have a fish like that first one . Bless the coloneI 's appetite  --  otherwise we would never have stopped for lunch so early . A week with him was enough . Not that I was n't happy to go with him to France , but when he wanted to stop at " a little inn I know on the Bodensee " on the way back to Stuttgart so soon after breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along for his pleasure , not mine . We went around to the terrace where tables were set for lunch in the open air at the edge of the still , blue lake . After the base and the rubble of France it was enchanting there ; I thought we must be in Switzerland . The waiter frightened me , portly and severe beside our table , waiting stiffly , linen napkin folded over his arm , as we read over the large handwritten menus with red tassels hanging  | down the centers as if there 'd never been a war . " What will you order ? " I whispered , afraid of being overheard by the intimidating waiter . " Order on the Bodensee ? Naturally we 'll order fish , " cried the colonel . Naturally . As it was still morning , we were the only diners . I was glad not to have to consider the impression of my ignorance on anyone but the waiter . The colonel did n't count , he was used to it , he enjoyed teaching me things which made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's how he wanted me to think of him . The sky and lake were a single , perfect blue , cloudless , clear ; you could hear the plop and echo of each pebble the colonel flicked into the lake as we waited for our fish . We drank white wine while the waiter removed our dinner knives and replaced them with the blunt-bladed fish knives . " What are these ? " I whispered . The ignorant would have taken them for butter knives , but I knew better ; they were far too big for butter knives , they were instruments of some importance . " They 're fish knives , " said the colonel . " You know , no steel blade must ever touch a fish . " For all his self-importance , he did impress me , that colonel . I never knew that about fish . I wondered what steel did to a fish . At last the steaming fish arrived at our table . I do n't know anymore what kind it was ; the names of fish were always strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marseilles , sole in England , and the birds , too . He said since they lived only in their native habitats there were no translations . ) But whatever its name , there it lay on its silver platter , a large fish with a flared tail of silver blue , and iridescent fins as green as a parrot , and a large white staring eye . One whole fish for each of us . Sprigs of parsley and slices of shallot were arranged around them  --  to make them appear more comfortable on land ? But that fish was of the lake ; the skin glistened like the sunlight on the surface of  | the water . I could n't bear to break the moment ( there were few enough magic moments when I was traveling with the colonel ) by breaking the shiny skin or cutting off the head . Besides , I had no idea how to proceed . The colonel shook open the Iarge linen napkin , laid it across his lap , and tucked it into his belt . I did the same . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish knife in the other , he flourished both and said , " Now watch . " I watched , engrossed , as he proceeded to press the edge of the knife into his fish , opening it from gill to tail . " Go only as far as the bone , " he said , " but not through the bone . Then slip the side of the knife under the flesh along the bone like this and flip back one side . " The fillet came up clean , whole , and boneless . " Then do the same on the other side , " he said , doing the same on the other side , " and there it is . See the skeleton ? " The skeleton was laid bare . " It 's ready to be lifted off with the head , and you 're left with the other fillet on the bottom , clean as a whistle . That 's all there is to it . Now you try it . Go on . Take your fish knife and try . " It was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , even on my first try . I , who avoided fish because of the bones , had filleted it perfectly . Of course I could n't leave that enchanted knife behind at the inn . I was not even ashamed . People took ashtrays and towels without a thought ; soldiers were going home with paintings from palaces and statuettes from churches , not to mention china , figurines , silver , you name it . I could have asked the colonel to buy me one , but it might not have been the same . I slipped the magic fish knife into my bag . Reluctantly she put the fish knife back into the Susan , where it would remain as long as she had hope , and turned to the next bag . The fifth bag , the Gloria , was named for the City Council  | candidate whose name and picture appeared on its side . Also known as Miscellaneous ( Misc . Gloria , she sometimes said or , nowadays , Ms. Gloria ) , it held her wig , her other shoes , soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic for rain protection which she kept tucked over the top . Here too she kept the cat food and breadcrumbs for the birds , and here she carried the kitten when she went out . But the bulk of her daily goods  --  towels , food , clothing for warmth and disguise , books , pots , newspapers and rags for insulation  --  were distributed throughout her room for temporary transfer to one bag or another . It did n't bother her to spread them about , knowing that , in the end , all things are connected with all other things , making her divisions ultimately arbitrary , like the arrangement of pictures on a wall or dishes on a shelf . Her supplementary possessions too were temporarily stored in an order that sometimes pleased but sometimes troubled her in piles , bags , and cartons around her room . Most of them were reserve supplies or inessentials which , however , gave her the sense of security , even comfort , that goes with being well supplied . You never knew when an emergency would arise . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin again . She kept a full complement of kitchen utensils in case she found a place with a kitchen . She had a line of beauty aids in case she fell in love one more time . She hoped Milly would recognize the value of her things , but she wondered if they were enough . Money : that was how Bert had won her away . Should she close out her bank account and offer Milly cash ? Owl lay down on the bed in the corner of the room . She was tired , weary of striving . If she got Milly back she could rest . Through the window she saw the tower of a forgotten building , ornately shaped and decorated , whose beauty was now hidden to all but her . She drew the kitten inside the sleeping bag and hummed a lullaby .  | On the one-week anniversary of Prince 's rescue operation at the Port Authority , he did not show up all day or night . He had drawn their baths and bathed her , he had brushed her hair , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a reluctant goodbye , warning her as usual of the dangers of the street . " Do n't worry , " she 'd said , " I wo n't talk to anyone . Who would I talk to ? I 'll be right here waiting . " When dinnertime came and went without his return , Robin told herself he was planning a surprise because it was their anniversary , and she dressed up specially for his return . But the hours came and went without him until midnight ended their anniversary . She took off her clothes and got into bed alone . For one whole week she had been happy , happier than she 'd ever been , more than happy . She 'd felt cared for , even cherished . The other men she 'd known had only used her , and afterwards had avoided her eyes . But Prince searched her eyes . His interest in her was so keen that sometimes he reminded her of her father keeping tabs . He wanted to know everything , and instead of despising her life , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love her for it . Love . She had not believed in it , and then , suddenly , there it was . She knew it by these signs : that he chose to be with her every day he was in town for seven days from the moment he 'd met her until now ; that he looked deep into her eyes when she spoke ; that he wanted to know her feelings ; that he brought her presents , watching her face light up ; that he taught her how  | to avoid the police ; that he bathed her , brushed her hair , and carried her to bed to make love to her . Now , without Prince , she plunged into despair . She knew all about disappearing ; it was her own best trick . Now , to be its victim , to be left alone like her mother . . . She could not get out of bed in the morning . She lay there all day as her mother used to do , betrayed , but willing him back . When he finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't ask about his absence . Instead , she tried to make him believe she had just got into bed . He took off his clothes and lay beside her without a word . When she leaned over to kiss him , he kissed her back quickly , then turned away . " Not now , baby , " he said wearily . " Is something wrong , Prince ? " " I got a lot on my mind , baby , " he said , silencing her with a look . She said nothing more . From the beginning she had been outside his confidence . When they talked it was about her , not him . She knew only that he was of mixed parents , that he 'd grown up in the toughest slums of DC , and that he 'd served a stretch in the navy . The rest , even his work , was a mystery . She guessed it had something to do with gambling  --  he frequently telephoned from the bar and at night practiced dealing cards for three-card monte  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea what he did with his time away from her , what his life had been like before he met her . The next day too he stayed out until very late . He spoke vaguely of " money trouble , " and acted resentful , as though she were somehow to blame . When she tried to be comforting he snapped that she 'd better start thinking about what she was going to do now , because he could n't go on feeding them forever . " Maybe I can find Boots , then , " she suggested unhappily . " Boots , " he said with contempt ; " Boots ! " She was afraid to dial Boots 's number again , but the next  | day when Prince had gone out she decided to look for her . Not since her first day in the city had she walked the streets alone . Either Prince had been with her , or she had stayed inside . He had filled her head with bleak tales of the fate awaiting runaways : of the sly questions the authorities would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can get picked up just for walkin down the street if you 're underage , " Prince had warned , advising her precisely what to say if she were caught ? false name , false age , false origins and residence . " You look like a kid , " he said , shaking his head , his voice filled with pity . " You 're a setup . Me , I know em , I can take care of em , you 're safe with me . But alone on the street ? Not a chance . " And when she proposed to work as a waitress or a checker as she 'd briefly done in Maine , he 'd merely snickered and said , " Yeah , can I see your workin papers , miss ? Your Social Security card ? Name ? Address ? " So protective had he been that he 'd bought her clothes ( a low-cut red dress , a sequined shirt , the newest highheeled shoes ) to make her look , he said , " older . " But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened to her . She walked among the streets vaguely looking for Boots , sinking into a state of lethargy . Instead of exciting her , now the streets depressed her , with their sordid store fronts and dirty windows , their screaming billboards and broken sidewalks , their trash-strewn gutters and grease-filled air . Everywhere she saw ugliness , squalor . Even the excitement of evening approaching , the sparkle of the women , the gaiety of the bars , seemed false as she made her way back toward Prince 's place at the Royal Arms . Looking for comfort , she crossed over to peer down an alley at the neighborhood cats whose gull-like cries made her think of Maine . But they were city cats , lean , caged behind a fence , probably mean . A dozen or more moved about , scuffing , scrapping , watching , or crying their endless lament . The alley reminded her of the dark hollows among the rocks , the space  | under the eaves , the boiler room in the school basement , the ladies ' room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces where she too had sought refuge from a cruel or indifferent humanity . " Here , kitty , kitty , kitty , " she said , wriggling her fingers through the fence . But they ignored her . All of a sudden cats came bounding from the back recesses of the alley to gather at the fence , as Robin had seen them do from the window , and she knew that the old woman with the shopping bags who fed the cats was somewhere near . She stepped aside as the cat lady stooped before the fence . Her large skirt formed a tent around her feet as she reached out to pet and comfort her charges . Patiently the old woman extracted an assortment of newspaper-wrapped morsels from one of her shopping bags , unwrapped them , then pushed them through the fence . Not until the cats were busily lapping the food , and she stood up to steal a look at Robin , did Robin see her face straight on . She was old and wrinkled . Her grayish skin was marked by several moles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sagging mouth , and her blue , wide-set eyes , now gleaming excitedly , were red-rimmed . Perhaps because they were almost devoid of lashes , or perhaps because the old woman was now staring fixedly at Robin , her eyes appeared extraordinarily round . Robin avoided her gaze , first raising her glance to the uneven fringe of white hair circling the old woman 's face , then dropping her glance to the equally uneven hem of her large flowered skirt , which dragged along two torn , dirty sneakers , from each of which a toe protruded . But feeling the beady stare , Robin could not long avoid the woman 's eyes . Though she found her grotesque , Robin stood transfixed in her stare , until slowly the woman raised one knobby finger , took a step forward , and spread her lips into a smile that revealed two appalling things : first , a black hole where a tooth belonged , and second , an intention to speak to her .  | The prospect of being suddenly spoken to by a witch so unnerved Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned abruptly , and fled across the street , not daring to stop till she had reached the Royal Arms . At the distant end of the block , she saw the sunset redden the luminous sky , silhouetting the warehouses against the rapidly descending evening , and she ached for the solace of the surf , for something familiar , for someone who cared about her . The room was just as she 'd left it , empty . She turned the radio on very loud , hoping to take her mind off the image of the toothless witch smiling down on her , now fixed in her eye . She showered , dressed , straightened up the room , dabbed perfume ( that Prince had given her ) behind each ear , determined to be cheerful when he came in . But as soon as he walked through the door she felt her own resolution dissolve into his mood . She felt like her mother facing her father , all her will slipping away . If only he 'd kissed her , maybe she could have pulled it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him what was the matter , a small muscle in his jaw began to jump  --  as if there were trapped words pressing to get out  --  but he said nothing . " Please , " said Robin , " please . " He looked at her , then clapped his hands . " Oh , what the hell ? " he said , relenting , and carried Robin to the bed . They made feverish love . She felt as if her world had disappeared and then come back . Afraid to ask him what was wrong , she pretended to be happy . He told her to put on the red dress he had brought her , he was taking her out . He had taken her out before  --  to bars , for ribs , for Chinese meals ; but she knew this was going to be different . When he was dressed in a fancy suit of cream-colored silk , he opened a small packet of cocaine , which he carried to his nostrils on a tiny gold spoon ; then he showed her how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said when she was ready . She had lipstick on her mouth and high-heeled sandals on her feet . She looked up into his beautiful face , his long almond-shaped eyes , and felt that whatever had been wrong was now over ; he was no longer angry , he cared for her again , she was safe again . They went to a small restaurant in what seemed like a private residence , for there was no sign outside , only the name " Continental " on a brass plate beside the entrance . A doorman opened the door , a slender woman in a snaky gown played piano softly and sang low torch songs from Broadway 's past while men and women in elegant clothes mingled at the bar . Smoke rose slowly in the softly tinted light . As Prince led Robin by the elbow past the bar , several people greeted him by name and looked her over  --  admiringly , she thought . A waiter in black took them to a small table near the piano and , after pulling out a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the menu . She was proud to be with Prince , pleased to be admired by his friends and served by his waiter , but bewildered by the new way people looked at her . Was it the high heels and the red dress ? She felt that Prince must be proud of her , too  --  as if the dress and he had somehow turned her into a different person . Prince ordered himself a Scotch and her a marguerita . While she sipped the salty , sweetened drink , he took her hand and told her with stoical regret that this dinner might be their last one together for a long time . " The honeymoon 's over , " he said , shaking his head . She opened her eyes incredulously . She could feel the tears welling up . " Well , what did you expect ? That you could just go on living off me ? Forever ? That what you thought ? " She had no answer to give . She had n't thought that , but she had n't thought anything else either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire week they had been together with no  | idea what would happen to her . " I love you , Prince , " she said simply . The tears began to slip down her cheeks . " Chicks . Do n't you know you do n't get nothin for nothin ? " She seemed to be hearing a recording of Prince rather than Prince himself . She tried to concentrate on staying upright . " I was happy to help you out as long as I had the cash . But now I do n't have it . My deal did n't work out . Now it 's your turn . Now you got to get us some cash . " " But how ? You told me I ca n't get a job without papers . You told me ... " He shook his head . " There 's plenty of work you could get if you wanted to . Beautiful little girl like you could make us a small fortune if you wanted to . One , two , three hundred a night , easy . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Like that ! " ? he snapped his fingers in the air . Robin felt her stomach drop . She did n't have to ask him to explain , for somewhere she had always known what he intended for her . Slowly she shook her head . He shrugged . " You 've done it plenty for free , baby , it never bothered you much . You did it for Boots , for strangers . Now you can do it for us . You can do the same thing and get paid . " " Please do n't make me , " she said , half to herself , shaking her head . " Make you ? No , baby , I would never make you . ' You 've got to want to . For us . " For them ? But did n't he want her just for himself ? " Just your body , baby . You save your feelings for me . " She shook her head . " I could n't . I could n't . " Prince looked at her mockingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many pleas . But each time she repeated it , it became less and less true , until finally she knew that for him , in fact , to keep him , she could . " I would n't know how to begin . " " Anything does n't come natural you can leave to me. "  | Now she felt herself grappling to find an out , stalling for each extra moment . " But what if I ca n't ? " she asked weakly . " Ca n't ? Did you ever have any trouble ? " Oh , she had always had trouble . " Of course , " said Prince , " you could always go home . You could always ? " " But , " she interrupted in desperation , " I mean , what if " ? her voice was now barely audible ? " what if I just ca n't ? " He leaned forward toward her across the table . His eyes glistened . " Ca n't ? How ca n't ? You owe me this . " She could see he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , then you 'll just have to pay me back what you owe me and find yourself another daddy . Cause this one ca n't carry you no more . " Prince flagged the waiter to bring them each another drink . As their glasses were removed Robin remembered that she was about to get her period . No one would want her , she rejoiced , while she had her period . When the waiter had gone , she looked up at Prince sitting poised and unruffled across the table and asked soberly , " Starting when , Prince ? I 'm getting the curse . " " Starting now , baby , " he said softly . " Starting now . "  | Although they spent their days in the same ten-block area and frequent nights on opposite sides of the same wall , Owl and Robin seldom encountered each other after Robin had been turned out on the street . To gather enough food Owl needed to search the gutters on the western side of the bus station where the markets were , while Robin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-being demanded nights indoors and days on the street , whereas Robin had been directed by Prince to work the night shift . Thus , even though Robin took her tricks to the very Hotel Venus to which Owl handed over more than half her welfare money every month , neither one knew it . The Hotel Venus had once been a minor monument of the area . Richly decorated with moldings and marble , it had been known for its six-story-tall central stairwell , with every stair carved of marble and the entire flight ringed to the top by a delicately turned mahogany banister . Though its graceful proportions were unchanged and its handsome facade was concealed by nothing more than several decades of grime , the hotel , like the neighborhood  --  indeed , like Owl herself  --  had fallen on hard times ; now the world saw only squalor . A skylight at the top of that graceful stairwell lit up the shame of the once fashionable place , now a last resort for the desperate and destitute . The lower floors were reserved for prostitutes and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivisions into Single Room Occupancy for the otherwise homeless . The mirror in the forlorn lobby was dirty and cracked . On each landing rotting trash overflowed the con-  | tainers and spilled across the hall . Plaster fell in clumps from the walls . Faucets dripped ceaselessly , lights burned out and were forgotten , no piece of furniture was whole , the ancient rugs were no longer of discernible color . A glassed-in courtyard beside the stairs , once a source of air and light , was now piled up well beyond the second floor with broken furniture , trash , and the carcasses of several disintegrating pigeons and rats , trapped long before in the shaft  --  all on permanent display . The tiled shower rooms were dark and musty ; the elevator was dangerous . Outside , the facade , with its elegantly carved statue of Venus , who lent her name to the hotel and still held up a graceful balcony adjacent to what had once been a lovers ' suite , went unadmired . Now , in fact , that balcony was fitted out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm to secure her room 's only window against intruders . Of course the manager complained , seeing only another pile of junk ; but given that for the previous year alone police records of the hotel reported three kidnapping-rapes , four dead-on-arrivals , one murder , and eighteen prostitution charges originating under the averted eye of Venus , he quieted down at check time when he got his rent . As for Owl , she felt completely justified . Danger was everywhere . Given such odds , she felt the fewer neighbors she encountered the better , and like most residents of the Hotel Venus she refused to answer a knock on her door . She had not always been so prudent . In her youth , thinking herself immortal , she had chased after thrills as ardently as any of the young toughs and molls who now strutted through the streets of the neighborhood . She remembered as a child watching a fire destroy a neighbor 's house , her first grand spectacle . While great , mysterious , yellow flames leaped crackling into the Buffalo sky , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red helmets trained their huge hoses on the flames and climbed tall ladders to the roof before an enthralled audience . It seemed to her that the worst misfortune  | of the dead man laid out on the lawn ( Eric Ludlow 's grandfather , who , it was later reported , had caused the blaze by smoking in bed ) was his having to miss the wondrous event . The terrifying spectacle had lit in her a fascination with danger that eventually took her all over Europe . In her fifteenth summer she landed a job near the deadliest roller coaster on Lake Erie and befriended the concessionaire in order to establish for herself free of charge the world 's record number of uninterrupted consecutive rides , no hands . For years she recklessly trusted strangers , running off on a whim with some , antagonizing others ; she had joined the WACs , taken joyrides on deadly mountain roads , swum in shark-infested waters , made love without precautions , hitchhiked through occupied war-tom lands where people wondered at a young woman alone . But as she gradually aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intimately how predictable were setbacks , how common reversals , how precarious survival , how inevitable disaster . Eric Ludlow 's grandfather , jackknifed over the fireman 's shoulder , replaced the flames in the center of that memory ; after the birth of her child , roller coasters made her shudder . Death could happen in any unguarded moment . That very morning , in fact , her next-door neighbor , the old man with the terrible cough who smelled up the hallway with whiskey , had left the hotel on a stretcher . Now , as she crossed the lobby toward the elevator , she heard the gossips still discussing him . " Dead or alive ? " " They do n't take corpses out through the lobby , stupid . " " Oh , do n't they ? Then why did they put him in a hearse ? " " It was an ambulance . " " Was his face covered ? Did you see ? " " I did n't hear no sirens . " Hearing the talk of death , Owl decided to forgo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bags and the ache in her legs . Given the hazards , few precautions seemed  | too troublesome to consider . Like every decision , it required a trade-off : safety for comfort , or comfort for freedom , sometimes one way , sometimes another  --  nothing was clear-cut . If she were neat enough to escape police detection , the greater her chances of being robbed : the perfect victim was a small , clean , defenseless possessor of several very interesting shopping bags . If , on the other hand , she looked fierce enough to repel muggers , the lobbies of banks and public buildings would be barred to her . As she was turning the key in the door of her room , she sensed something wrong . The feeling was often with her lately : several people on her floor had been attacked in their rooms in recent weeks while she had been spared . Could she have been saved for something worse ? Was this Bert 's doing ? She put down her bags and , hesitating on the threshhold , peered in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a velvet cloth that kept out light , the switch was halfway down the wall , and Owl 's flashlight had only one battery . She felt in the Susan bag until she found her knife , but as she was afraid to have it wrenched from her hand and turned against her , she stealthily held it behind the folds of her skirt as she inched her way into the room . Something hit her knee . The kitten , leaping toward her skirts , mewing for food . With pounding heart she picked him up with her free hand and , holding him like an amulet , took several cautious steps toward the light switch . She flicked it on . No one . Nothing . Yet she could not shake the feeling that her room had been invaded , contaminated . Nothing seemed disturbed ; still , the danger she 'd felt so often lately came through strong and clear . More than a feeling , it was a message , a warning from Beyond . She knew to respect such messages . A couple of years earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detour through  | the very intersection where the sisters of the Shelter were doing outreach to homeless women on the very day a fire in the Midway Hotel had left her homeless . The very intersection , the very day ! Clearly a message . Or the time she had followed a sudden impulse to go to the dance hall by herself and wound up meeting the person who would introduce her to Jay . That must have been according to a plan . Or the time she decided for absolutely no good reason to demand her love letters back from Jay , the entire collection of them , his and hers , only to learn a week later that he 'd been killed . An accident on the autobahn . He 'd survived the war only to fall on a maneuver . She could still see the tall , awkward sergeant telling her , as he turned his hat nervously in his hands , how Jay had been thrown from the jeep clear off the road and a branch of a tree had gone through his trachea . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said to her . She had been so shocked that more than thirty years later her throat still ached when she remembered ; she would never really recover . A freak accident ? If it had n't been planned , why would she have taken back her letters just then ? If she 'd done it a week later , it would have been too late ; the whole camp would have been able to read their most intimate declarations . So amazing did such " coincidences " seem that sometimes she believed she had powers not only to receive warnings but maybe to control events as well , nor did she rule out powers of life and death . Was n't it true , for instance , that for several months wherever she went people fell down on the ground in epileptic fits ? In the bus station , on the pavement , once two rows behind her in the balcony of the theater where she was watching the last performance of a closing play with Sister Theresa and some of the other Shelter women . She alone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra and had gotten Sister Theresa to summon an usher . It had been terrible : they stopped the show , turned up the houselights , and sent someone out onto the stage  | to beg for a doctor to rush to the balcony . Who knew who else would fall down frothing in her path ? And Milly 's husband Harry almost died of a fit too when he heard of Owl 's impending visit , or so he said . Owl held the kitten and searched the corners of the room . Now she was convinced her scare was Bert 's doing . He knew Owl had a sworn statement out against him and a suit for millions of dollars which , if she managed to find him , she would press and win . And whatever money she won would only be a fraction , a symbol , of what he owed her . She put down the cat and took a packet of papers out of the Barbara bag . First : he owed her for the house and all the furnishings he 'd stolen  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked by hand while she was pregnant with the boy , the picture of the Balinese dancers . . . . Everything but one trunkful of clothes and personals left behind in the attic . He 'd driven her mad with betrayals , then packed her off to the looney bin and stolen everything . He 'd planned it all  --  otherwise why had he come back to her after leaving the first time ? After her discharge she 'd gone back to her house ready to start again . She had walked up the drive and seen a strange car in the garage with Jersey plates ( the garage door had foolishly been left open ) and a green swing set in the backyard she 'd never seen before and a new set of redwood lawn furniture . And the box hedge neatly trimmed . Bert had never trimmed the hedge unless she 'd carried on about it . She remembered thinking , looking at that hedge , Maybe he 's really changed , and she looked around for Milly . And then she saw a strange woman in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen door . This ca n't be his new woman , Owl had thought , she 's not his type , she 's too old . What do you want ? asked the woman in a cold , suspicious voice .  | What do you mean asking me what I want . I ought to ask you what you want . This is my house . Your house , she said , her hands on her hips . Your house . And then she reached up to her dark temples and smoothed back her hair and said , Oh , you must be Mrs. Fox , and now you 've come back . That 's right . Did n't you know this house was sold ? Almost a year ago . Did n't they tell you ? Did n't who tell me ? I asked . I did n't trust her . Your husband . Him . Of course , I thought , this has to be his doing . I looked at her hard . After everything else he 'd done , there was nothing he could do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , Do you really expect me to believe a thing like that ? I knew my own house when I saw it , whatever the woman said ; I 'd lived there for eleven years . Hey , I said , angry as hell , what are those swings doing here ? And where 's my daughter , anyway ? She stepped back inside and talked through the screen door . Listen , she said , we moved in here nearly a year ago . They 're my kids ' swings , we put them up . I do n't know where your kid is . The place was broom clean when we arrived , the only thing they left behind was one trunk in the attic . Do you want to take a look ? Listen , they should have told you , this is terrible , I 'm really sorry , you know ? I 'm sorry , she said to me . I should have told her to get out of my house . But instead , like a fool , I asked , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were my letters from jay ? Did Bert steal them too ? Jay 's letters were n't in the trunk , just my clothes and all the things I 'd kept in the front hall  --  Milly 's report cards and poems , my cedar box , old datebooks , but nothing of Jay .  | And that 's the second thing Bert owes me for , thought Owl . Jay 's pictures . The only two pictures she 'd ever had of him Bert made her destroy . Out of pure jealousy . And because she wanted to start out the marriage clean , she 'd let him take Jay 's pictures and burn a piece of her . Because everyone was trying to forget the war and start again . So many had died , so much had been destroyed , everyone wanted to bury the past and make life grow again . You do n't need these anymore , Bert said as he put a match to Jay . I 'm going to take care of you now . You do n't need anyone but me now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country was pairing off , settling down , and moving into new houses like the one Bert bought on a GI loan the minute she got pregnant , a two-bedroom ranch with a front yard and a backyard . This is okay for now , he said , but just wait till you see how I 'm going to take care of you . Lies : the third charge against him . Now he owed her hundreds of thousands of dollars for ten thousand lies . The Easter he said he was going fishing with two salesmen but he never went fishing . The season he said he was taking an extra line on the road that turned out to be a redhead . And after the boy died and Milly was born , he was never there when she needed him . That time Milly fell off the swing and needed seventeen stitches in her head , Bert could n't be found at his office , at the customer 's , anywhere . Three hours after he left for work , at eleven o'clock in the morning , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time she realized he could n't be trusted she 'd buried one baby and half raised another and had forgotten how to fix a light switch . By then she could barely remember she 'd once traveled all over Europe , the indispensable right-hand gal of a colonel in the US Army , the fiancee of the handsomest soldier in France . In that township of brand-new houses , where everyone started out equal , nobody had a past . You had nicer parties or duller ones , better eggnog or worse , a larger car or smaller , smarter kids or dumber ones , more money  | or less money . But no one had a past . Since the war ended people admitted only to futures . Plus damages , of course , unspecified amounts , for all he had made her suffer . She could n't begin to name the damages . To every lawyer 's consternation , the amount would have to remain unspecified , because the longer she lived the greater the damage , the deeper the debt . And when you counted inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage became incalculable . Even without adjustments , he could never repay her for the damage he 'd done . The debt could only be wiped out by death And suddenly Owl knew what was wrong in her room . It was the missing sound and smell of her neighbor . The whiskey smell had been erased by the fumigators whom the city hired to follow two steps behind the corpses and scrub away the smell of death . The ceaseless cough Owl had gradually come to count on had abruptly ceased . In its place was only a silent threat : death on the way . This was the warning , then , the message from Beyond : death on the way . She put away her knife and stooped to mix milk for the kitten , sprinkling powder from a box into a saucer of water . She hoped it would forestall death ( though milk from her own breasts had not saved the boy ) and welcomed the scream coming from somewhere down the hall . Indeed , if one day the familiar scream failed to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would mourn , so precious were all the signs of life , even the questionable ones like the sound of sex coming through the floor and walls that most nights kept her awake . The first night Robin took a trick into the Hotel Venus as Prince had instructed , she was so terrified that her trembling fingers could not undo her buttons . ( Later they laughed about  | this , and she took the street name of Button . ) On the street where Prince had left her with praises , reassurances , and a few brief instructions as to price and procedures , she had been merely numb . Standing alone , she had talked the project up as an adventure ( thinking of Boots ) and down as just another job , reminding herself how sex was nothing but a diddle and a squirt and how in the past she had been able to do it painlessly with strangers and how the worst that could happen was she 'd lose her nerve and be back where she was when she 'd arrived . Carefully she observed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lines , until the first man approached her . It happened so quickly , she did n't have time to be afraid . She performed by rote , following her cues like an actress in a play , reciting lines she had memorized . He said his , she said hers , and she was proud of her performance . But once she was alone with him in the second-floor room of the Hotel Venus , she began to sicken and shake . All alone on an island with the tide coming up and no boat to save her . He was her father 's age , of medium height but solidly built , even plump , with hardly any neck and a beer belly and small gray beady eyes that frightened her . The minute he closed the door behind him and leaned against it , his eyes , terrifyingly bright , bore right into her . She thought there was murder in his eyes . ( She had seen that look before ! ) Frantically she looked around for some escape . But the tiny room was barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , and a small drawerless bureau . She remembered each detail of the room , that prison : Room 2o6 . Graffiti on the wall in nail polish : Indio y Esmeralda , Feb. 7 , 1978 . Ancient , greenflowered wallpaper , ugly stains on the floor . The patched and repatched door frame , betraying many forced entries , offered no hope . The ceiling was pocked with bubbles of bulging plaster , the remnants of years of unattended leaks which now threatened to burst through like crashing surf . The wall behind the sagging  | bed was disfigured with gouges and holes where the ill-fitting headboard had been banged repeatedly ( and she knew how ! ) against the wall . In the corner , a small marble basin , cracked and discolored , echoed a faucet 's steady drip . The only light , a bare bulb screwed into a wall socket , left her in semidarkness . The single window was covered by a gaudy paper curtain tacked to the frame , disguising whether beyond it lay safety or death . How had she managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly felt frail and tiny and young , a country person in a big city . She backed toward the window corner , afraid to anger him by screaming but ready if necessary to jump . Instead of pursuing her , the man stopped at the bed , removed his pants , tossed them over the chair , and lay down . Once his pants were off and he was flat on his back , Robin felt a giddy surge of relief . She remembered the giant Ferris wheel in Birchville . Hanging in terror at the top , nothing below you but sheer drop , then a sudden lurch , a plunge  --  and just in time , as she felt her heart ready to burst from her and save itself , the reprieve from annihilation that returned her safely to the ground . She began to giggle , then laugh , like someone suddenly saved . Laughing , her hands shaking , she fumbled with her buttons . " What 's so funny ? " asked the trick . Now , he seemed not frightening but ridiculous . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on laughing . " Come on . What 's the joke ? " He raised himself on one elbow and peered past his belly . " I 'm just embarrassed , " she said coyly . " Aw , " said the trick , " you want me not to look ? " Suddenly she could n't wait to tell Prince . Suddenly she remembered everything he had told her to do  --  get the money up front , fill the basin , soap the washcloth . Now she was eager to do it right and get it over with , for she knew that this  | act , completed , would somehow bind Prince to her as nothing else could . At last the buttons yielded . As she pulled her top over her head ( " You want me not to look ? " he said again ) embarrassment flowered into contempt . They were partners now , Prince had said . He had promised her a golden charm to wear around her neck to commemorate her first trick . He had given her a pep talk and advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hotel Venus where he 'd introduced her personally to the night porter Vego and had shown her where to stand a few doors down on the stroll . " I 'm in your corner , baby ; remember that , " he had said , squeezing her hand . " Now you got to show me you 're in mine . " Then he had let go and moved away . " Prince ! " she called after him , afraid to let the next moment come . " Wait . " He turned and blinked his eyes . " Baby ? " " Tell me what I 'm supposed to say . " He smiled and shook his head . " Nothin , baby . Trick 's not buyin conversation . " And as he continued walking away , leaving her to stay or run , she saw her choice . The bed creaked as she worked her first trick with her hand , getting him ready . A cat was crying somewhere near . She hoped , as she remembered hoping before , that he would come quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat went on , like a crying gull at dusk swooping over the rocks ( and the sky behind the distant pines streaked with red , and her mother on the deck with a cigarette in her red hand ) . The trick put his hand on hers and gave her his rhythm . " A little faster now , sweetheart , like this . That 's a good girl . " She listened for the wind in the pines and the surf pounding against the rocks . But she kept hearing the cat cry , and her heart went out to it .  | Owl opened her eyes . Flash of red and green neon at the dark window behind the velvet cloth , harsh music through the thin walls ; bass guitar , something rattling the glass , monotonous thud , thud , thud of sex . Once Owl would n't have cared about the sounds of sex , or , if she had , would merely have turned up the music on the radio . But in recent years she had become a light sleeper , with fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long since gone to thieves . The walls , thrown up quickly to make ever smaller and smaller rooms , were thin enough to be kicked through . This knowledge kept her alert . The moans and thuds of sex were indistinguishable from those of assault ; the sounds of pleasure were like those of pain . Whereas once it would have taken a great disturbance to wake her , now all it took was that monotonous , steady thud . She unzipped one side of her sleeping bag to check the kitten . She knew she should n't let him sleep with her , for how would he ever learn to survive in the alley ? But somewhere she had lost her knack of discipline and lived by the kindness of the moment . She stroked the kitten , accepting her wakefulness , and , listening to the sounds , imagined lovers . In Roma , in Munich , the walls had been thicker , the rooms made for love . Even the crumbling palazzos with their peeling paint were adorned with ornately framed mirrors on whose gilded moldings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the streets , but inside lovers lay intertwined , fresh curtains hung at the windows . When the love sounds came through the walls up went the music out of modesty . Fox-trots and waltzes had played on the GI station , war songs , " The White Cliffs of Dover , " gay songs of homecoming , and love songs about remaining lonely and faithful and true . Owl closed her eyes , moved her body rhythmically , and hummed a tune from the past . Sometimes , she recalled , if there was wine , we kicked off our shoes and danced in the rooms . And if he had a thirty-six-hour pass we called it love .  | The rhythm from below stopped abruptly . Was it to be three tricks an hour , then , all night long ? Twenty minutes a trick , cash in advance , plus ten dollars at the desk protection fee for transients . TOS 's they were called : Tricks Off the Street . Pulling in fifty dollars a night and more . No wonder there were fewer and fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything for money . He could forbid pets , true love , but TOS 's with their moans and groans that kept the residents awake were perfectly acceptable . Money , money , money . Owl remembered hotels in other times where people cared about other things . Not only the rich had nice hotels ( though she remembered the Excelsior on the Via Veneto in Rome where the prostitutes were movie stars , and the thieves were some of the richest and shrewdest men in Europe and fat King Farouk of Egypt sipped aperitifs with his entourage ) . She also remembered the poor pensions on the Ramblas of Barcelona with their iron balconies and white-washed walls overlooking the fresh flower stalls , where , when you wanted to go home , no matter what the hour you clapped your hands and a gatekeeper appeared with a great ring of keys to unlock the door for you . She remembered the antiseptic Swiss pensions where , even in the hotels of the lowest class , your room was spotless , there were two fat pillows , and you were treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London where bed and breakfast included tea with your landlady , who tucked a blanket over your legs at teatime to make you cozy and even covered the teapot with a fitted quilt on the frostier days and always heated your bed at night with a bedwarmer filled with hot coals . She remembered the funny room in Paris she had shared for a month with Jay before they sent him off to die : the ancient floor slanted steeply , the walls had layers of flowered papers going back centuries , the WC in the hall was often clogged or occupied , for that winter there was an epidemic  | of dysentery in the quarter ; but the people made that one the nicest room of all . Almost immediately Fouchet the concierge began sending a fresh flower in on the breakfast tray , sometimes a carnation , sometimes a rose , to celebrate the presence of lovers . ( How French ! Jay had said . ) Later , they discovered the flowers came from the trash can across the street next to a theater where Fouchet 's young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you thought about it . And even in the poorest quarter of Naples , where it seemed everyone was forced to steal or sell themselves at the end of the war , Giuliano , the one-armed youth who sold his cousins to officers , shared his food with orphans . But here ! Now ! How many times had she found herself swearing to leave , to sweep her belongings into a blanket , throw her whole life 's remains into one of the laundry carts left standing unguarded in the halls while the maid was cleaning the transients ' rooms , and depart ? But then it would begin to rain , or the sun would shine familiarly on the little cactus on the windowsill ( if it was morning ) , or her sleeping bag would look too worn to make the move , and she would remember that people had grown cruel everywhere ( for times had changed and she was an old woman now ) ; and here at least she had only two flights of stairs to climb to her room . Yes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wished she were the sort of person who could simply stay inside her room for days at a time . Some did . There were even groups of volunteers who regularly dropped in on the " housebound " to make sure they had n't croaked . But for herself , she would have found such a life unhealthy ; she would rather drop in on the volunteers . Indoors for too long one suffocated . If she were the sort who could stand being a prisoner even in her own room , then she 'd have been better off submitting to a home , where at least her meals would be provided , or the grave ,  | where they 'd be unnecessary . But she was not yet ready for oblivion . Shut up inside she knew she would soon be forgotten . Whereas , on the street , around the corner a free breakfast awaited her , it was only two blocks to the bus station , the neighborhood cats and birds now counted on her , and soon she would invite Milly to stay with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rent , though exorbitant , was manageable if she was careful about everything else ; the neighborhood , though alarming , was familiar . And though she no longer had a radio , she could start music in her mind at will to drown out the sounds of sex , and use the past for entertainment . The thumping had started again ; someone was banging on the wall . So what ? Her nights of easy sleep had long since vanished ; it did n't matter what went on in the rooms below . Her window stuck , soot piled up on the sill , the neighborhood was finished , the whole world had gone to hell . Bombed-out buildings , dirty kids begging in the streets , selling black market cigarettes , coffee , older sisters , meat . Where had the time gone ? What had happened to the years ? She wanted to save one more memory from oblivion before it was too late . Tomorrow she would start . She would try to arrange her things in some inevitable , irreducible order , strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noisily Owl collected into one small compact mass the thin layer of nighttime phlegm that lined her throat , rolled it along her tongue , and with precision spat it into the litter box . A beginning . She rezipped her bag , buried her better ear , and selected . . . a tango .  | As he waited in their room at the Royal Arms for Button to come back from work , Prince slapped the three cards between his fingers , shuffled them , and called to an imaginary mark : " You can win and your money wins too . Pick the red , forget about the black . Pick the Queen , forget about the Jack . " He liked the rhythm of the monte rap , the charm you had to use with it . Three-card monte was a cleaner game than poker , more challenging than craps , requiring speed , skill , psychology , and art . The player needed a magician 's sleight of hand and an actor 's presence . He 'd been a shill and a lookout in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into his own game . He was good , but not yet good enough . Even experienced players sometimes made mistakes that cost them ten to thirty days in the joint . He 'd been in once ; that was enough for him . He wanted to raise his game so high he 'd never have to worry about the joint again . One day he hoped to join the top players in real estate , banking , government , gold , men who were rich enough to be jailproof . Work did n't scare him : every morning and every night he did an hour of pushups , deep knee bends , and one hundred shuffles , just for investment . A true player was on the job twenty-four hours a day , always ready to pursue an opportunity . Because if it was you against the world , you never knew when you might have to split ; you always had to be ready to live some other way . You could n't  | afford to have only one game or be dependent on only one person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when folks were really out for themselves . He 'd made the mistake himself once , getting married . Even his own mother had been a chump , putting all her faith in one disappearing man . Leaving her family in the barrio near Manila , leaving her home , traveling all the way to Washington with a baby inside her to search out a tall , fair-haired , balding man who had told her only lies . Finding instead ? Work , work , and more work . For years she waited , praying in church , enlisting priest and neighbor to petition the government , finding nothing . She was so single-minded that not until Prince was twelve years old did he understand the truth : his father had never wanted them ; his mother would never find him . No matter how much she prayed or slaved or preached right and wrong , Prince could see there was no one in the world to do right by her unless it was Prince himself . His father , on whom she pinned her hopes , was of no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince 's white blood meant nothing to the handful of neighborhood white kids , though it won Prince hostile looks when his black friends talked about whitey . Who was he ? He did n't know . He only knew that he had been duped no less than his mother . He learned many things that year he turned twelve and wised up . When his class moved up to junior high , an almost all-black school , the very whites who had excluded him because of his mother 's eyes were themselves excluded from the newfound pleasures of the street . He was glad to see them put in their place , even by the girls whose kisses were prized and who preferred his looks to theirs . Neither black nor white but always the exception , he studied the ways of both . Hanging out on the street , he copied the walk of one friend , the smile of another , the jive of a third , learning how to move ahead . His mother , a saint , was also a fool , trying to hold him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please her , he knew that the  | dead life of the believer or the slavery of the trusting was not for him . That year he made a private vow : to outsmart everyone . He valued brains and cunning above all . Not school brains that studied books ( which he mastered in the arms of girls who lent him their homework to copy and let him crib off their tests ) but a man 's brains that mastered life . He 'd wanted all his options open . And still did . Because you never knew what might happen . You could spend all your time on your main lady  --  making the necessary appearances on the stroll and in the bars , checking out the new arrivals , staying in shape , arranging your woman 's ID , medical checks , comfort , bail , knowing the movements of the heat , giving up a little dick  --  and still she could go down to work one night and never come back . She could decide to blow ( like Sissy ) , she could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't much you could do about it . Like the poor suckers who got themselves killed in Nam , while he cheated death by joining the navy . But even on a ship , or even with two or three women working for you , it was an insecure life . One night they could all run off , and then ? With most chicks it was cop and blow  --  cop one week and blow the next . And it was hard work copping , you could n't hope to catch every day . You could run down your best shit six days a week and still draw a blank or lose out to the competition . So you had to do your pushups every morning and do your shuffles every night and keep your eyes open for every chance to lift your game . Button came into the room , dropped her purse on the table , kicked off her shoes , and collapsed onto the bed . Prince put down the cards . " How you feelin , baby ? " " Okay . " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her , searched her face , and kissed her mouth . She looked troubled . " Somethin wrong , baby ? " She started to say something , then hesitated . " Just tired , I guess . "  | But there was something in her voice that bothered him . He 'd have to figure it out fast ; this might be the moment he 'd either lock her or blow her . He tried every way he knew to ease her job , tuning her up with candy , jewelry , and smoke before she went out , tuning her down with baths , rubs , and understanding when she came home . But the pressures of the street were hard on a fresh young ho like Button , and it took skill to get her thinking like a ho . " Anything happen you wan na tell me ? " he asked , gently stroking her cheek with his knuckles . She closed her fingers over the gold heart he had given her to wear around her neck and shook her head . " Okay , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I fix you a bath ? Close your eyes and relax till I call you . " He turned back his shirt sleeves , picked her purse up off the table , and walked back toward the bathroom . Robin closed her eyes and waited on the bed while Prince ran her bath . Usually the thought of the bath awaiting her when she came off the street got her through her last few tricks , but tonight nothing would relax her . For the first time in the week since she 'd been hooking she had n't made her trap . She was afraid of what Prince would do . Since it was the first time , maybe he 'd let her off ; but she 'd listened to the other hos enough to know that coming in short was serious . Lana would n't have dared go home short ; her man would think she was stashing money for herself or taking time off the job . Robin wanted to explain to Prince that it was n't her fault ; it was simply a slow night , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't made for hooking . When she could smell the lilac bath salts , she took off her clothes . Soon Prince came in from the bathroom , took her hand , and led her to the tub . He was big on washing . He 'd  | bought her a douche bag , bubble baths , bath salts , mouthwash , and assorted lotions and scents . Just as he kept their shoes heeled and shined , their clothes laundered and pressed , he saw that their hands were manicured and their bodies clean . On the island she 'd seldom taken baths . Her father 's grand future plans for solar heating meant they had to heat their bath water on the wood stove . In summer when you could bathe in the ocean no one ever bothered and in winter the air was so cold that the water cooled down as soon as you got in . Until Prince took charge of her body , she had n't known what pleasure a bath could be . Until Prince took care of her , she had n't known what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gently with the warm scented suds , then took a bath sponge from the shelf and , starting with her toes , washed her all over , working slowly up her body , bathing away all the bad she 'd felt that night . Always before she had loathed her body  --  the knobby knees , the smells , the pubic hair . But knowing herself under Prince 's care , she came to see her body as a thing of value and even , when he washed her , of loveliness . Besides insisting she use the douche bag twice a day , he made sure she took her pill each morning and her bath each night . He scheduled her for a monthly visit to the doctor  --  to check on her " little gold mine . " Now he was patting her dry with clean towels , gently rubbing her thighs , placing a sweet kiss on her navel . " Come to bed and I 'll rub your back for you , " said Prince , throwing the towels in a heap . While he kneaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a half-sleep . She wanted to stop , sleep forever , never go back to the stroll ; she wanted to ask Prince to let her quit , or at least to lower her trap . But she knew he would never agree . If she gave up hooking she 'd have to give up Prince , and that she could n't do . Only a couple of weeks , but he was part of her now ; even in her dreams she was hooking.  | He kneaded her shoulders and watched her doze . He had counted her money and found her short . So that was the problem . Now he had to decide how to handle it . Some pimps would discipline their bitches for being a penny short , but Prince liked to think he played a higher game . Of course , every bitch needed a certain amount of discipline and maybe an occasional scare to keep her in line . But if you felt you had to use threats of force all the time on your woman , then something was seriously wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman was going to cut out . You could n't just blindly follow the rules . You had to know your woman . With a kid like Button , affection was better than discipline , she was so grateful for every little bit . If you scared her she would probably run . You wanted her trusting , not afraid . Trust was her greatest need , and therefore her weakness . Not that he would n't play on her fears if necessary , but they had to be fears of what would happen to her without him . Getting picked up , being sent back home  --  these were the fears she harbored all the time . It would be stupid to threaten to hurt her , like any dumb popcorn , when her own natural fears were working for you and a hint would probably be enough . He watched her firm young flesh resist the pressure of his thumbs and wondered why she was short , what she was doing wrong . Young pussy ought to draw the best ; that was why he risked the dangers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you could pull seven years . ) He doubted she was holding out on him . In fact , if he trained her right and she did n't burn out or get hooked on junk , he believed she had the makings of a first-class ho . But like anyone in the life , she had to correct her mistakes and keep lifting her game . Maybe now was the time to teach her how .  | She opened her eyes abruptly to Prince 's voice . " You know , baby , " he was saying , kneading the last trick 's touch out of her hips , " I notice you 're a little short tonight . That 's not good . Now do n't worry , I 'm not gon na send you back out there tonight , though you know I have every right to . I just want to talk it over with you so you can learn some better ways to make your trap . " She was angry and grateful at once . " Thank you , " she said , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart . " Forget it , baby . If I had money comin in and it was you here countin on me , I expect you 'd treat me just the same . You 'd rub my back ; you 'd do the listenin . When I have money in my pocket , you can be sure my lady 's gon na have money in hers . Right now , my lady 's the one out there workin . Naturally , when she comes off the bricks after workin all night , I got to make her feel good . She 's got to know that her work is appreciated . She 's got to feel glad she had that opportunity ; otherwise , why 's she out there at all ? " It was true , she was out there for him , because he took care of her ; that was the deal . And he did his part so well , how could she not do hers ? He kept saying he only needed a little more time to tighten up his own game , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the street and back in school , " taking care of the brains . " She 'd have liked to hear more about his plans , but she did n't want to press him . When she was suspicious , so was he ; when she was trusting , he relaxed . He called her his lady , slipped spending money into her pocket , dressed her , fed her , bought her anything she wanted , took her hand when he walked beside her as if he was proud . He thought about her life , her future ; since he 'd paid off his bills and got back his wheels he was even putting money in a joint  | bank account for them . How could she ask for more ? But she was glad she was lying on her stomach so he would n't see her face . " How we ever gon na get ahead if you keep comin in short ? A few nights like this and we 'll be really hurtin . There 's lots of things I want to see us doin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat for winter made of some soft , pretty fur . And a diamond ring like mine . Hmm ? I 'd like to see you back in school , too . But all those things cost . " He was waiting for her comment , but all she could think of was how she was n't really a whore at all , she was just an understudy who 'd landed the part for two hundred dollars a night and ought to feel lucky to have the break . " I 'm real proud of the way you been workin , Button . You 're a smart little girl ; you learn fast . But now it 's time for you to spread out , climb on up to the next step . You got to make your trap and save your body at the same time . For example , you could start doin a little creepin . " " What 's that ? " she asked . She was an actress and Prince was her director , her audience , her fan , waiting in the wings with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . " Basically , it 's very simple . After the john takes his pants off , you make sure they 're hangin over a chair right near the door . Then when you 're workin him over , another ho  --  your partner , Jacki , say  --  will creep into the room , slip out the wallet , take out the cake , and put the empty wallet back . If you 're doin your job , trick 's too busy to notice a thing . You get on top , kinda cover his face , let your hair fall down on his eyes  --  that 's all there is to it . You do the same thing for your partner , and you split the take , fifty-fifty . Now is n't that a ways up from just layin on your back all night ? " " But that 's stealing , " said Robin , alarmed . Prince smiled . " Stealin ? From a trick ? I would n't call it that . I 'd call it gamin . You got to remember , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it 's up to you to turn that game around . A trick 'll rip you off every chance he gets . You do n't believe me , just forget to ask for your money up front some time and see what happens . " It was true . They always tried to beat her down . " But what about later , when he finds out ? " " What about it ? You 're just as surprised as he is . You do n't know a thing about it . He was with you the whole time , right ? " " But what if he sees ? " " What if he does ? He sees someone else in his pants , not you . You do n't know nothin about it . The way he 's dressed at that moment , he 's not gon na go chasin your partner , either . That 's the beauty of it . " Prince 's voice purred with satisfaction . " And you can always run off before he 's in his pants again . " Robin knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants or out . Running was her specialty . But if he went for the police ? " What if he gets a cop ? " " Come on , Button , use your brains . What 's he gon na tell a cop ? I was fuckin with this ho , see , and someone rifled my wallet , officer . , I do n't know who she was , officer . ' No , forget your what-ifs , baby . Creepin is just part of the game . It 's a matter of skill like all the rest . " He turned her over onto her back and smiled down at her , while she studied his beautiful face . She hated everything about his plan , but she was too exhausted to protest . Even when she was fresh , he could sweet talk her into anything . Now all she wanted to do was sleep . " I just want to see us get ahead , baby , that 's all . If you 're goin back to school , we only got the summer to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you know that . But Ceepin , you can make it in half the time . Think about it . Smart little girl like you is gon na come up with the right answer , sooner or later , I guarantee . "  | Usually Owl tried to get back to her room by dark . But today was Saturday , and Saturdays she stayed out late to feed her cats . On Saturday a certain fish store threw out whatever fish would n't last the weekend . Then Owl took an extra plastic bag from her reserves , filled it with fish treats , and walked directly to the alley . The pleasure she took watching her cats gobble up the fish and lick the last morsels from their whiskers and mouths made up for the fact that her own meals lacked such luxuries . Now , returning late to the Hotel Venus , her munificence was rewarded . For there across the street was Milly again , playing dress up , walking up and down the street on high glittery heels with the other whores . Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Owl , she must be on her own and Owl might have a chance to win her back . She got out her glasses for a better look . How the time flies , she thought . The old-fashioned shoes are back again . The high spikes with ankle straps , glittering platforms , silver ornaments , open-toed sling-back pumps , and the round-toed ones called babydolls . Wait long enough and everything returns : long skirts , short skirts , long hair , short hair , low heels , high heels , even the wonderful hats  --  their day is coming too . Now , thought Owl , I could wear a comfortable blouse from any year and sneakers that fit ; but poor little whores refuse to be seen in last year 's clothes . . . . Whores ? Just little girls dangling cold butts from their lips , Lucky Strikes or Camels , cheap men 's cigarettes , same as in the war . Hardly anyone  | actually smoked them , of course ; they brought too good a price to smoke . Like the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better things . Owl wondered briefly if anyone ever smoked them , or if they just went round and round , tobacco money ? Owl feared she had nothing to offer Milly now . All the beautiful clothes , the spring hats and pastel toppers and little white gloves Milly had loved to wear , all were gone . In the Misc . Gloria bag she had nothing of value but a bit of old lace and a curly brown wig she had picked up at the Shelter . ( Sister Theresa had insisted she take the wig , saying someone had donated two hundred shiny new wigs and what were they to do with them ? ) And some very beautiful old jet buttons . But nothing with which to buy Milly . For without a doubt she was up for sale . For rent , at least . Owl was n't surprised . She 'd seen it in the war : young girls in bombed-out cities and even in Paris , selling themselves for their next meal . The soldiers paid for a night or a week or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States like black market treasures . She had to admit she had sold herself too  --  down the river , into marriage . She , should have known better . She 'd seen the faithless officers , she knew what happened to wives . She 'd been reluctant to become one a second time , but Bert had convinced her to trust him . Then he turned out exactly like the rest . His betrayals  --  so trite , so predictable . Lipstick on the collar , out-oftown trips , furtive phone calls , erratic hours , a sudden interest in new subjects , new music he 'd never listened to before . Oh , she could tell . After so many years a wife could certainly recognize the signs . When he 'd finally confessed , it turned out he had not one woman but a string of them , all kinds of them , a private phone in his office , a room in town . He was no different from all the rest ! " But Lilly , " he said , " they meant nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get out ! Get out ! " she screamed , and went on screaming long after he had gone . For herself , she thought she would not have cared , seeing how he was . But for Milly .. . " Where 's Daddy ? " " In California . " " Will he come back for my birthday ? " Seeing Milly weep , Owl wished needles sunk into the centers of Bert 's cold brown eyes , she wished his hands scalded in boiling oil and worse . " I ca n't talk to you when you 're hysterical , Lil . Get hold of yourself . I 'm going to count to five and if you have n't calmed down , then I 'm going to hang up the phone . " Even now , when she read over the letters she had sent to him in California she would weep or scream again . Even now . After she left the hospital her bitterness , like the bitter poison deep inside the convoluted pit of the peach , continued to poison her , keeping her half-crazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she still carried them in the Barbara bag , a strong bracing spice to flavor her hate that she could take in small or large doses whenever she chose . On doses of poison she grew strong , she grew fierce , her bitterness gave her strength and reason to live . Now she was very strong . She needed no one . A man with a limp approached Milly and her friend . Owl knew what he wanted , what they all wanted . Owl wished she could spare the girls . None of those men had anything to offer but cash , whereas Owl was willing to share a lifetime of treasures , knowledge , priceless love . What a pity there were so many children sleeping in doorways , begging on corners , selling their favors , or she would take all of them home . She wanted to rush up to the two girls , hug them , whisk them off the street , give them something to eat  --  fruit , chocolate , something to delight them as the fish had delighted her cats , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child into a shopping bag , take her to her room ,  | and begin to show , tell , and explain . She would start with now , pour out her heart , explain the shape of her life , how she had come to this , then go back and back and back until the vise of the past came open and Milly finally understood . The man with the limp had gone off with the other girl , leaving Milly alone . Now was Owl 's chance to make her move . Oblivious of oncoming cars tooting their horns , she lifted her bags from the curb and moved into the street . Screeching wheels swerved close to her , puffing out her skirts . What did she care ? Across the street she marched , lugging her bags , her eye on Milly , until the light turned yellow and a long van hurtled to a stop , cutting her off . " Dirty old bag ! " shouted the driver , honking his horn . " Account of you I miss my light ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground in the middle of the avenue , stranded behind the truck , unable to see through it to the far side of the street . Let them honk , she did n't care . Old bag ? She could not be dismissed so easily . If she 'd waited for the light to change , she could have lost Milly . Let the cars wait instead . She pressed ahead , swinging her bags , weaving among the cars as the light changed again and the mad traffic resumed . When she finally reached the other curb , she saw Milly running up the stairs of the Hotel Venus with the colonel close behind her . Owl could hardly believe her luck . After all those years of thinking Milly dead , to find her staying in her own hotel ! Quickly she would prepare her room for company and invite Milly in . As soon as they got to the room , the trick moved close to Robin , explored her face , and in a voice barely over a whisper offered her an extra twenty if she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly ? " she asked .  | He laughed gleefully at her innocence . " You just sit on me the way I show you and . . . urinate . " Her eyes opened wide as she stared at him . " You mean , pee on you ? " " You got it , honey . Do it and this is all yours . " He held out five crisp tens . " Do n't worry , I 'll tell you exactly where to sit and what to say . It 's easy . Think you can do it ? " Robin looked longingly at the bills . Almost as much as she 'd get for two plain tricks . " I do n't know . Maybe you should explain it first . " " Okay , " he said . " Here 's what I want you to do . You 're a little kid , see , on your way home from school . You 've got ta go real bad , you 're practically peeing in your pants . When you get to the corner there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted the bed . " You know you just ca n't hold it anymore , so you go into the field and take off your pants and squat down . Meanwhile , you do n't know it , but I 'll be waiting right there in the bushes . I come up and ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " That 's it . I get under and then you pee . Okay ? " Robin wondered what Vego would have to say about her getting the bed wet and if the pee would come out at the moment she wanted it to . " I 'll try , " she said , taking the money and slipping it into her pocket . Owl offered the kitten a fish treat and explained her plan to him . She would divide everything into three rough categories : those to be saved , those to be reconsidered , and those to be dumped , in preparation for Milly 's return , for the room was a mess . Invoking her old rule of travel , she vowed to keep nothing she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she set herself the task , it became clearly impossible . That rule of her youth no longer applied . For one thing , it assumed a long future in which there 'd be plenty of  | time to replace whatever might be hastily abandoned . But having long since turned that corner beyond which her future was a rapidly diminishing fraction of her past , whatever she dumped she would probably never recover . And how could she tell when her reserves , now piled to the ceiling around her room , might be required ? For another thing , such a rule was mindless of the irreplaceable value of the old . That no one else wanted a thing was to her reason in itself to preserve it ; the most precious creatures in the world were the nearly extinct . For these reasons she was afraid to part with anything . Even her books and magazines , seemingly dispensable , she was reluctant to give up , for those she 'd read were now part of her , and as for the others , having once assessed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she prematurely jettison them unread ? If she had had access to a library , then she might , in the interest of order , have gritted her teeth and banished them all . But the library  --  that great , vast storehouse of the past , that enviable public monument to order , which she circled every day  --  was barred to her as long as she refused to check her bags . And recklessly check her bags in a public checkroom for any clerk to ransack was one , thing she could never bring herself to do so long as she was free , not even for access to all the knowledge in the world . It would be like placing her soul in a 42d Street checkroom . If she could do that , she could use a public shelter ( where they searched your bags ) , submit to a home ( where they emptied them ) , consign herself to a hospital , a suburb , or a prison ( where they confiscated them ) . No , she could as soon abandon a wounded bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to throb from the effort of fighting against herself . She could assign each object in her room a value on whatever scale she chose ; she could class an item essential , important , of interest , possibly useful , worth considering , unimportant , unnecessary , probably useless , and so on , to as narrow  | a category as she liked , but she could not consign it to oblivion . Let there be a thousand classes , or a thousand thousand , to choose from ; the lowest would remain empty . The only way she would ever be able to reduce her inventory was to stock a shop with her treasures and sell them off , or let it all go up in flames . She sat down on her bed and lit a cigarette . The kitten leaped into her lap . The fact was , she had accomplished no more than to divide her possessions into new and subtle categories spread all over the floor and shift them from one spot to another around the room . To be " reconsidered " later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or another what to keep and what to dump required an exact knowledge of the future , or a disregard for it , equally beyond her capacities . Of her own future , she knew only that she wanted it to end well . She could not afford to enter it ill-equipped . Whatever she had so far failed to acquire , she would probably never have ; what she had failed to accomplish would remain undone . She was formed , fixed . She could not change herself even for Milly ; Milly would have to adapt to her . She decided she would be content if she could simply pile the piles higher to clear off the table and chairs for a place to serve Milly tea , and empty a spot on the floor for Milly 's sleeping bag . The Fourth of July was approaching : celebration time . She would pick some flowers in the park to brighten up the place and hope for the best . At the start of rush hour on Friday , to the signal of a cherry bomb prematurely exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , soared over the park , circled the great New York Public Library , and with a whir of wings landed on a lintel above the side entrance , touching off the long weekend on 4zd Street . Below them on the sidewalk a virtuoso combo ,  | consisting of a youth on alto , another on tenor , and a seasoned old-timer on vibes , took up their instruments to blow holiday spirit into the hearts of office workers now heading for the subway and their long-awaited holiday weekend . The summer 's first ; the hustlers ' best . Downstairs in the subway station , a pickpocket couple ( he the jostler , she the snatcher ) searched for the unlatched purse or the carelessly pocketed wallet as each customer left the token booth . Across the street the unflappable three-card monte team , consisting of Sweet Rudy shuffling , Bluejay as shill , and Prince as slide , used more subtle means to separate the suckers from their cash . " You can win and your money wins too . Pick the red , forget about black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pick the red , get your money back , " sang out Sweet Rudy , dealing a red queen and two black jacks onto a hastily upturned cardboard box . Prince listened to the music of Sweet Rudy 's rap while he watched for signs of police . He knew it by heart  --  the rhythm of the words , the feel of the cards slipping between the fingers , deliberate and devastating , like whispers slipped between lovers ' lips . He practiced the shuffle every day , those movements fast as the flick of a tongue , the tips of the cards bent like winks , the lightning signal to the shill , the split-second timing , the teasing play of win and lose breeding confidence and greed . Soon , now , he would be ready to deal . Of course , the slide was essential too . Without Prince to warn of danger , Sweet Rudy would not be able to concentrate all his skill on the cards and his attention on the mark . But anyone could serve as lookout , and what Prince had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on top , calling the plays himself . It was n't just the flash of the game that  | made him want to deal , though he longed to show off those skillful fingers and seduce strangers with his tongue . It was n't so hard to entice a sucker into thinking he could pick the one red card out of three and then prove he was wrong . Nor was three-card monte , which any dude could pick up quickly in the joint , particularly high game . Working in the open , you risked arrest , and splitting the take with at least two others , you could n't get rich off it . But you could get smart . Unlike mugging or thieving , buying or selling , or working for chump change , monte was a mind game requiring discipline and nerve that could train you for life . It gave you capital for higher game , kept you careful , and best of all , gave you a quick win . It was the start of all Prince wanted : to impress , stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inside for fifteen days . A six-by-eight cell with iron bars , twenty watts of light , a dripping faucet , a clogged piss hole , and three cellmates , all losers . That was all , that was enough . Fifteen days to think , fifteen nights to feel bugs crawling through your bed , to breathe the stench of vomit and filth , to hear junkies sob , to see men humiliated like animals . Shortly before he was to leave , a young hustler named Black Oscar joined his cell , replacing one of the losers . Small and alert as a weasel , Black Oscar used jail like a training camp : starting the days with sit-ups and pushups in the cell , running in place on mess line , dressing in his prison garb as if he were going dancing in custom clothes , making contacts and conquests at every meal , befriending the guards , using his spare minutes to make plans , dealing imaginary cards in his bunk at night . Respectfully Prince watched him , amazed at the possibilities of life in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day Prince was to leave , Black Oscar asked him to deliver a message for him when he got out ; Prince accepted the mission as if it were a personal gift . Later that day , just before he was released , Prince suffered  | a lecture on the future from the warden . " You 're young . Your life is ahead of you . No one can decide how to live it for you . Except you . You can work for a living or you can wind up back in here . It 's up to you to decide . We 've got plenty here who have n't made up their minds . They 're in and out , in and out , till one day they find out they 're in for good . Ten years , fifteen , twenty-five , life  --  you name it . Now , you can go out and find yourself a job or you can go right back to the street . Be a winner or a loser . Think about that , young man . It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that , hard , for fifteen days . Long enough to play right past the warden and his jive . The only chump jobs he could ever get were just like being in the joint . Break your ass for a paycheck too small to let you live and wind up back inside anyway . No , he had decided ; he would give himself a break . Walking out that prison gate into the sweet autumn air with Black Oscar 's message and trust , he knew he could never again be a chump working for pennies and death if he could be a player working for riches and life . At a signal from Sweet Rudy , Bluejay adjusted his black eye patch , donned his most earnest look , and put two tens down on a losing jack . Two marks in jackets and loosened ties groaned no in unison . " I know where it is . There 's the red , " said the towheaded mark , bending toward his friend . " Is n't that it ? " asked the other politely , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his black mustache and thrust a twenty into the mark 's hand . " The money 's yours if you call it right . You want to bet ? Put up your cash and I 'll let you see it . " But both marks refused the money , taking a step backwards . Down the street rolled the plain green Chevy Prince knew as the wheels of the pussy posse . As slide , his job was to spot the blue dangers  --  marked cars , uniformed men . Lately ,  | plainclothesmen had been entering the game , changing the rules and the odds . Sometimes Prince wondered why the police even bothered with pussy and street gambling when the rest of the world did the same things for higher stakes . How did they draw their lines ? Now , you never knew when a mark or a trick would flash a badge , when a bag lady would turn out to be a decoy or a bum stand up and make an arrest . It got harder and harder to tell who was gaming and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , with plainclothesmen tricking players , players gaming off squares , hos off tricks , pimps off hos , the rich off everyone . The whole world was into it . Even the squarest square thought he 'd outsmart the rest when he tried to pick the red . In the end , thought Prince , you could only tell the chumps from the players by who won and who lost . He let the green Chevy roll on past without sounding his alarm , knowing it was stalking female game , and wondered if Button was where she was supposed to be . Sweet Rudy picked up Bluejay 's bet and with a sympathetic grin turned up the losing black . " Almost , " he said consolingly , falling back into the rhythm , " almost but not quite . You can win , all you got to do is play it right . Pick the red . Pick the red . Pick the red . " Again he threw the three cards down on the box in quick succession , capturing the longings of the growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , face down , while all up and down the block , every fifty yards , wherever a game was set up , marks emboldened by shills reached for their wallets . Some people , thought Prince , were dying to lose . But what did he care as long as his team did n't ? One blast of his whistle , one shout from his lungs , and the team would kick over the box and disappear into the crowd as quickly as the cards flew under Sweet Rudy 's fingers . Each would pivot on his heel , push his hands into his pockets and join the marks , leaving no trace of the game but a cardboard box . " Beautiful , " said Sweet Rudy proudly each time they reconvened safely around the corner for another go .  | That day they 'd already played four different gigs . Between two and three the team had bagged three hundred plus from the paycheck-happy crowd emerging with stuffed pockets from the bank conveniently located at Fifth and 43d Street . " Like Willy Sutton said , " observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . " Following the money , they snagged another two from afternoon shoppers several blocks up Fifth . Now the money was en route to the bus and train stations in the pockets of commuters on their way home , and when that supply diminished , they could work the visitors coming in . Bluejay had carefully plotted their movements to coincide with the movements of the marks . " Marketing , " he called it . Bluejay bet another twenty , this time on the bent card , the red . " I knew it ! " repeated the towheaded one , as Sweet Rudy paid Bluejay off , two for one . Three pretty teenaged girls sharing an ice-cream cone sauntered by , catching Prince 's eye . " Hey , pretty baby , got a lick for me ? " he called , flashing his best smile as they came abreast . They turned on him with a snarl . " Fuck off , jerk ! " " Punk ! " " Pig ! " If he had n't been working he would have shown them who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get you later , " he hissed menacingly , marking them as dykes or libbers from the way they screamed . It disturbed him deeply , the way the world had turned . People had revolted against nature . In Tahiti he had seen the way life ought to be , but here , it seemed , men were giving up control and everywhere women were taking over . Soon no one would even remember what nature meant . With their power slipping away every day , men became lax , weak ; some even sold their manhood , their bodies , to other men , like low-down hos . No wonder women thought they could walk all over men . When men acted like women , women were free to act like men . And even the best of women , like his mother , who wanted nothing more than for her man to rule her , were forced to live unnaturally . He sent her money when  | he could , but not even money could make up for his father 's failure . Every man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No longer was there any respect . Men who could n't control their wives turned into tricks , forced to buy what nature gave to them by rights . He watched the three bitches swing on into the crowd as if he did n't exist . Sometimes , he thought , he 'd like to let go and smash heads . And then he saw them  --  two men in blue moving in fast from across the street . Had the chicks been decoys sent to distract him ? No time to think  --  he had to sound the alarm . He shoved the whistle between his lips and blew two shorts and a long , loud and shrill . Too late ? " Slide em up ! " he yelled , wildly waving his arms . He leaped for the corner , his heart thumping , as the other players , transformed into pedestrians , disappeared before the approaching police . Prince turned the corner to see someone who looked like Button with her arm linked in a man 's cross the street . She could be cheating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else . No time to check on her now . Behind him another whistle blew . More cops or another slide from another game ? Four games in the block including a dice game called cilo had dissolved like raindrops in dust at the first sound of the whistle . In their place , clutching twenty-dollar bills , stood several bewildered marks , now doomed to live out their lives without knowing if they had been denied their just winnings or luckily saved from scam . In that eternity between flight and safety , when anything could happen , Prince wondered if in the end you could ever really know who were the chumps and who the winners .  | Owl woke to a sharp , hammerlike clap just outside her room . The kitten tore across the floor , from their mattress to the door and back again , where he cowered in a corner . Gradually Owl focused her eyes . A man was leaning against the door , just inside , staring down at her . It was dark in the room ; only a periodic flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's feverish eyes glowed bright , his long narrow teeth shone iridescent in a demented grin , his greasy blond hair glinted as it brushed against his shoulders , his narrow nose was like a blade , and his watch , buttons , and belt buckle flashed a harsh metallic flash . Let it be a dream . A dream ? Yes  --  for her failing senses were perfect again ! But everything was happening too fast to be a dream ; too fast and too slow . The man grinned . Her heartbeat raced , her breath stopped , the pulses were pounding in her ears so that she could n't hear , her hands were icy , her knees uncertain , all the tempos and temperatures of her body were madly out of whack . One minute she was dozing and the next she was staring up into an absolutely terrifying grin . How , without breath , would she continue to live ? Slowly the truth seeped in . A man . Half grin , half leer . She could n't look away . She filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was check time ; she should have taken double precautions . That day she 'd cashed her check and paid her rent and everyone in the lobby knew it . Paying her rent set her up for the jack rollers . She should have waited or gone to the sisters ; she had known it was unsafe at the Hotel Venus .  | And she had seen that face before , too . Once near the bus station in front of a grown-over lot where a burned-out building had stood ( that was the first time ) . She was sure now that it was the same face , same man she had noticed standing alone , his hands thrust deep in the pockets of his long jeans , his shoulders hunched over to disguise his height , that demented leer on his face . Creep , she had thought , first seeing him , creep ! creep ! ? and in the same moment had regretted the thought , knowing how people looked at her with loathing too . Still , she had crossed to the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but those bright feverish eyes and grin had stuck in her mind . She recognized it several times again after that , as she saw the man alone in a doorway smoking cigarettes on her own street , doors from the hotel . Yes , it was the same man ; with her sudden super-vision she was quite certain , even in the dark , of the nicotine stains on his long fingers with the bitten stubs of nails  --  drifter 's hands now tugging at the buckle of his belt . Belt ! Then it was not her money he was after , it was her-self ! He took one step toward her , slowly , that mad look on his face . Her bags were out of reach . Terrified , she forced herself to her feet , bracing her body against a pile of cartons against the wall . Seconds more , she knew , and his belt would be open and then his pants  --  and once he had gone that far he would never retreat until he had her . If she had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept in the Susan bag , she might have plunged it into his middle , or hit the bull's-eye of his Adam 's apple on that too long stem of a neck . What loathing she felt ; she tasted loathing on her tongue , felt it constricting her throat ; each discrete instant of this passage was suffused with loathing that filled her mouth , making her fierce enough to kill . But her bags were out of reach , there was nothing but papers and old clothes in the cartons at hand , and she had no  | other weapon than her body , herself . Herself  --  all but useless against the hulking form leaning toward her with that hideous grin . Yet she had to act  --  now  --  before the hands were done , now ! Instinctively she opened her mouth and let out a terrible rolling scream . He could have silenced her forever with one well-directed blow ; still , she had to scream . She had led several lives and known many men , some needy , some dangerous , some careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt such rage . Enraged by her own terror , she could hardly meet her attacker without puffing out her feathers and fur , without arching her back , hissing , fluffing her tail , like the animals and birds she fed , letting loose her most ferocious cry . It was not a calculated scream , for she had not even known it was inside her ; yet it was deep and necessary , a missile with which she pitted her will against her assailant . It filled the space they shared , it spilled into the hallway , invaded the corridors , rang like a siren through the empty street , shrill , resonating , desperate ; she heard it rise and build , becoming an impenetrable wall of sound , a barricade against that monstrous leer . On it rang , one long , unflinching note , and far above it like dream music she heard her voice weave intricate flourishes of sound that carried her high and away . Those feverish eyes were glazing over and she thought she saw the grin intensify into a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , higher , higher , as high as she could go . She wanted to deafen her assailant with her scream , stop him , turn him back , obliterate him . She would never have guessed such a scream lay waiting inside her . His eyes wavered , feared ; his hands fumbled on the belt ; she saw him hesitate  --  and then very slowly they began gliding apart , he was growing smaller , less sharply focused , he was holding his pants together at the waist , backing out of the room . He turned and fled .  | Robin had grown accustomed to the screams and cries in the Hotel Venus , as she had to the sirens and the sharp crack of trucks backfiring on the street . A moment 's panic , then calm again . But this scream was such a long wailing cry , like the wailing note of the foghorn in Hewitt 's Sound , that she forgot herself . " Jesus , what 's that ? " she said , breaking the rhythm of the trick on the bed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fog , boats could break , men could drown , wives would worry and get drunk . " Do n't worry , honey , please , " said the trick , moving her hips with his hands . " You got ta keep going and I wo n't take too long . " The way he swallowed his words and glanced sideways at her from behind his glasses , she could tell he was half embarrassed , half ashamed . And when he came right out with apologies , pitying her for having to service him , she almost pitied him for needing her . For however unpleasant this flabby , defeated flesh ( turkey throat , drooping breasts , Buddha belly attached to the little pink penis ) , she favored it over the proud and dangerous kind . She looked down on his face , thrashing back and forth as she moved her hips in small circles , and felt her pity drown in contempt . Tricking was like Indian wrestling ? seeing whose contempt was stronger : his toward her for selling it , hers toward him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy your way , but there was also power in being desired . She 'd learned that from Jacki , whom Prince had entrusted with her instruction . Now , hearing the trick grunt ( and the scream still coming through the wall ) , seeing the sweat on his brow , Robin knew she had learned the lesson well . Jacki was a large , impressive woman : fleshy , big-boned , generously endowed . She had a large head with double chins , round pink cheeks , big brown eyes , a pouty mouth with brightly  | painted lips , and mounds of coarse bleached hair . Perfume and smoke preceded and followed her . From her full breasts and huge swaying hips she abruptly narrowed down to delicate feet pressed into narrow shoes with high spindle heels , in what seemed a precarious balance . A sophisticated lady from Virginia , at twenty-eight she was the bottom lady of Sweet Rudy , and an old hand in the life . " What does a man know about this work , honey ? Now listen to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very smart lady , " said Prince . " I 'd trust her with anything but my life . " ) Jacki had taught Robin many things : Turn down any trick you have a funny feeling about ; always get your money up front ; go twice for no one ; save your body ; stick to Swedish massages ( by hand ) , or French ( by mouth ) , and only go Spanish ( between the breasts ) , Russian ( between the thighs ) , American ( a body roll ) , or Danish ( inside ) if it 's worth the money . Never go longer than fifteen minutes for one trick . " The meter I use , " said Jacki , sounding like Boots with a drawl , " is a cigarette . I light up when we get in the room , and when that cigarette burns down , that 's it , I 'm done . For special customers I light an extralong . " Now Robin was able to win the contempt match much of the time . Her island training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work : once you overcame the initial embarrassment and could tune out trick talk , it was just a job , better than free fucking or working for chump change , with plenty of drawbacks but with plusses too . " Where else , " asked Jacki , " can a girl like me hope to land a job that pays fifty thou ' a year working my own hours with no references ? " Jacki showed her the practical side of hooking . The first afternoon she dropped in on Robin , bringing with her a box of fried chicken and two large chocolate bars , it was a little after two . Robin had been up for about an hour and Prince was out . Jacki announced she had come over because her own TV was broken and she did n't want to miss her soaps ; but privately  | Robin wondered if Prince had n't sent her over . True , Jacki did turn on the TV as soon as she arrived and pulled a table and chair up near the set , but the sound was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the kitchen with beer , Jacki led right in talking . " The things I 've seen , " she said , opening the box of chicken with her long red nails , then taking a bite of thigh . " Listen , nothing surprises me . Around here you see everything . Some of these tricks are so sick I feel sorry for their wives . One old fart , a big lawyer downtown , all he wants to do is to howl at me like a wolf  --  ow00000 ? and another one wants to hear me panting . They probably stepped out of the same wet dream . And a couple of my regulars want nothing else except to dress up in my clothes , especially my shoes and underwear . I charge them all extra and give them what they want . What do I care ? I 'll listen to them howl , I 'll pant , I 'll tell them how gorgeous they look in lace , I 'll do anything they want as long as they 're not diseased or dangerous and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how to check if they 're clean ? " Robin shrugged and chewed on a mouthful of chicken breast . " You do n't need a doctor to tell you how to spot disease . It 's easy . But I 've still known hookers who 've gotten so sick they 've had to leave the life . I think that 's the sickest , not taking care of yourself . Me , I 've got too many big plans ; no john 's going to infect me ! If you do what I say , you 'll be safe , too , Button . You 're young . You 've got a dozen good working years ahead of you . You can build yourself a small fortune if you 're smart . " A dozen years ! Prince had promised her she 'd be off the street by the end of summer . " As soon as you get into the room with your trick , " said Jacki , " you fill a basin with warm water and get it soapy . If Vego tries to cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At  | the Hotel Venus you 're supposed to get clean towels and soap with every trick ; only the key is extra . Anyway , once you 've got that water good and soapy , you can start working on him . Use the washcloth first if you want , but then use your hands . If you 're doing it right you 'll be getting him hard while you 're soaping him up . You 'll be rubbing his prick and tickling his balls with your nails and talking real sweet to his cock . You 'll tell him how you think his great big cock is your personal ticket to heaven . Then he probably wo n't even notice when you milk that prick like this " ? she took Robin 's hand and gently squeezed up and down on her thumb ? " and watch carefully to see what comes out . If you get anything yellow or pus-y you give that john back his cake and send him on his way . I do n't care what he 's paid , believe me , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth getting diseased . You 'll be the only loser . But if you just ca n't afford to lose the bucks , or if you think he 'll freak out on you , then you could give him a hand job or use a condom and wash yourself real good afterwards , and then go see the doctor . Some girls always use a condom and skip the examination , even if they 're on the pill . You 're on the pill , are n't you ? Personally , I think they take too long coming with a condom , but it 's up to you . With a condom it 's not even messy . " Robin half agreed . Nurses and doctors had it messier , maids and masseurs . Robin herself had had messier jobs . When her mother was trying to kick , she vomited every time she swallowed water , and Robin was the one who cared for her . As she cared for her brothers the summer the Red Tide got the clams . Even cleaning fish for her father during mackerel season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never bothered to pay her , talk about chump change ! ) was messier . " But for myself , " continued Jacki , " I would n't let a sick trick near my pussy or my mouth , even with a condom . I take care of myself , my body . You should too , Button . I give myself  | a vacation from the street for at least a month a year , just to clean out my system . Even if there is n't any heat I give my body a rest , maybe work a while as a stripper , get a change of scene . It 's too easy to burn out in this life . I 've got too big an investment down there , I 've got too many plans , to take unnecessary risks . " " What kind of plans ? " " Did n't I tell you ? I 'm going into business . Very soon . I 've got it all figured out . A beauty parlor with a mini-boutique in the front where I 'll carry a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry , maybe leather things , designer stockings , cosmetics  --  stuff like that . I 'm going to do the whole place in white and glass and one color , maybe fuchsia . The ceiling will be fuchsia with recessed lighting and music and probably fuchsia chairs . I 've got a collection of catalogs with all the kinds of equipment . Dryers , sprayers , shampoo chairs , and booths  --  you name it . You 're welcome to come and see . Sweet Rudy says we 've already got half the money saved up . " Robin was impressed . She had no plans . To find Boots or maybe a rich john ; to be an actress or a stewardess and ride in planes and travel ; to get to see Adam and Billy again . But her hopes were more a feeling than a plan . Prince was the one who made the plans . " And another thing , " said Jacki , picking the last crumbs out of the box , " watch out for pacemakers . Look them over for scars , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . It sounds unkind , but it 's no joke when they croak on you . You do n't want to be there , believe me , and the heat all over the hotel . It happened to me once , a trick died before I even got started . He just plops down on the bed and never gets up . There 's this trickle of blood coming out of his nose , and I ca n't wake him up . Hey , I was scared . A bloody fuckin nose ! I thought for sure they 'd try to pin a murder on me . I did n't know what to do . I was n't even sure he was dead . "  | " What did you do ? " " First I got him dressed . That 's when I saw the scar on his chest . I knew what it was , cause other tricks had told me about theirs . Now I can recognize them half a block away . " " And then ? " " Then I split and phoned the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take him away . But he was already dead . It was too close for me . After that I worked as a stripper for a few weeks till I got my nerves back . " Nerves . Jacki said success on the job depended on your nerves . No matter what they said , you had to remember they were just johns and not let them get on your nerves . That was the part Button had n't yet mastered and maybe never would . She 'd been at it for weeks now , but her nerves had got worse , not better . Prince was pushing her to do more specials , but she could still barely manage the regulars . There was always that moment with each new trick when her stomach dropped , her hands started sweating , and she wanted to run . She tried to dismiss her fears , remembering that , as she 'd learned from the boys peeking into her tent , it was she who had the laugh on them ; but the contempt she 'd cultivated to use against shame was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of cake ? She hated the job but she loved the cake . Prince said that at a chump job ( if she could get one ) she 'd be the boss 's trick and have to work all day long for what she made off one twenty-minute trick of her own . In one night on the street she made a waitress 's weekly wages . In a month she 'd have enough to send for her brothers , get her nose fixed , trace Boots , buy two tickets to California , anything they liked . A little more time and Prince could buy new wheels , she could go back to school . . . . No , she could n't think of quitting now , just when they were moving ahead . The future was so long . Anything could happen later . She could n't get into making plans like Jacki . Already she was a  | different person from the one she 'd been a month before ; when the summer was over and they were ready to move she 'd be another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a year she might be flying , in five years she could be married , and in ten years . . . But ten years was forever ; in ten years she 'd be twenty-six . Maybe she 'd be rich and famous by then . Or maybe dead . She was relieved when the scream finally stopped . At once she got the rhythm back again . After that , it was only seconds till the trick came . With the condom it was n't even messy , just as Jacki said .  | Owl lay curled up for the night in a recessed doorway across the street and three doors down from the Hotel Venus in clear view of her window and balcony . The kitten was tied by a ribbon to her waist ; the Barbara and Susan bags were heaped as a makeshift pillow . Nostalgically she watched the window of her abandoned room , trying to remember the names of all the things she had stored upstairs that were now fair game for the looters . Her things ! Her things ! Soon now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no way to save them . Already the swelling had worsened , the blue veins pressed dangerously against the skin . Already she was plagued by painful cricks in her back and neck when she awoke in the mornings stiff , stooped , weighted down with fatigue . But what else could she do ? This was as close as she dared approach her now contaminated room . Up there the sick leer of the man she modestly chose to call the Flasher ( though he might have been worse ) hung in the doorway , awaiting her return . Owl could almost see it reflected in the luminous green of the neon sign flashing GIRLS , GIRLS , GIRLS , the teeth gleaming in rows like the bars of a cell rendering her room a dangerous trap . Each image of it , of him , made her shudder . Not even her bed , reduced by him to a dispensable luxury like love or meat , would entice her back , for what was a bed compared to freedom ? A bed was the bribe they held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shelter , a brothel . . . . No , she 'd rather do without a bed than be trapped alone in a dangerous room or be locked up for life . Part of her had to be glad , even grateful to the Flasher for exposing that terrible baited trap of a room in time for her to escape !  | The great thing was , she was still alive . She had cheated death and the Flasher for another week , and though she no longer had a room to offer Milly , at least her best bags were beside her or else safely locked in a locker . Perhaps one day soon she would feel safe enough to return to her room to rescue the few important things she wanted for Milly , since her rent was paid up for the rest of the month . If not , she would make do . She had survived on the street before . She knew several abandoned buildings and all-night offices where she could go in case of rain , and an alley where she could change her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of the crowded street where even in the deep of night she could hear the songs of sailors in port and the murmur of vice , and between naps she could keep an eye on Milly plying her trade across the street . Owl closed her eyes to watch Milly out the kitchen window playing in the backyard . In and out of the garage she ran with that exuberant squeal , now fetching a rake for gathering leaves , now carrying tiny teacups , now playing hopscotch on the driveway or jumping red hot pepper through the rope , her yellow hair flying up and swinging down . The customers with their hot desires who stalked these girls up and down the block , then followed them into the Hotel Venus , reminded Owl of the neighborhood boys chasing the girls back into their own yards at dusk . When Owl looked up she saw a soldier looking Milly over . Owl knew why . But could n't he see she was just a child playing dress-up ? She was teetering on those too-high heels , nervously twirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her school play  --  could n't he see ? But of course he saw ; he did n't care . Just like a soldier . Thinking all he needed to take her away was that uniform and money . Maybe nothing ever changed . She remembered her own unbidden passion for soldiers in uniform , that delicious long-  | ing that never let up , that secret consolation of war . She remembered her first . She still carried his picture in the Ellen bag  --  one of those pictures you took in a drugstore booth for a quarter and that came preserved in a small metal frame . A stranger on the way to the German front who offered to help her find her way to the right platform , he had invited her to have a drink with him . How could she resist the lure of that uniform ? He cocked his head at a charming angle , rubbed his jaw , tipped his soldier hat with a smart little bow , and took her hand . Then , in the station bar , unwilling to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was short ) , he persuaded her to miss her train . For half a second she hesitated , afraid to expose her inexperience ; and were n't soldiers shipping out supposed to be dangerous ? But her eyes were drawn to his chevrons and medals , she could n't keep her hands off his khaki sleeve , and who was there to stop them ? There would be another train at midnight and another the following day . They took a room in the station hotel and were asked no questions , for he was a soldier with a pass in wartime . Time ran differently then , remembered Owl ; you did n't have time for the usual questions , you would n't suffer the usual inhibitions , you seldom told each other your real names . Beyond the inescapable fears  --  VD , pregnancy , fate , and hopeless love  --  there was nothing to hold you back . Time was short  --  one night  --  and were n't final nights of war reserved for love ? In that snapshot of the two of them , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture had been snapped before they 'd gone to the hotel , though in truth she no longer remembered . " For lovely Lilly from Alexander the Great " was gallantly penned across the bottom  --  some private joke , the meaning of which she had long since forgotten ; for her lover 's name had certainly not been Alexander . Whatever  | it was ( Steven , maybe ? Charles ? ) , he had gone to Germany , she had had word of him once or perhaps twice , and then no more . Later , after she had enlisted herself , she heard he had probably been killed . She forgot the details ( it was so long ago ) except for a few . He had given her a box of Russell Stover chocolates and a red rose as he said goodbye ( tipping his hat with a smart little bow ) , he drank rum and Coke , he smoked ? Camels ? But she forgot . What she did n't forget  --  what she remembered with perfect clarity despite the years  --  was the disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each sexual touch ; how he placed a towel over the sheets and then , when they were finally exhausted , how he slept in his underwear when she longed to feel him close against her . At the time she accepted his fastidiousness as her due , even as thoughtfulness . Her inexperience kept her from knowing that men who so rigorously insist on the rites of cleanliness are either men who go with whores or men who have been impressed by the hair-raising hygiene lectures fed to GIs . Eventually she came to treasure the smell of sex ( of love ) , the feel of a spent , sticky man against her , the dampness of his body and the sheets . Even then , she would have relished his lying on her with all his weight and sweat . But being shy and inexperienced , she said nothing . That he hardly touched her body with his hands or lips , as if she were somehow dirty from the start ; that he ignored her inexperience ( for she had confessed to knowing intimately only one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment he awoke in the morning , though she had been waiting half the night for him to wake up and renew their kisses ; that he said nothing tender or reassuring to her afterwards , though earlier he had remarked on her eyebrows and lips , even tracing them with his fingertips , were details she would often remember over the years . His name was gone , but not his ways ; and whenever she looked at the photograph she  | would compare him and his ways to men who had excited her less but loved her more , men who delighted in her body and gamed with her mind , men who loved and licked and treasured her . With the knowledge found in new experience and every passing year , she would judge him anew  --  sometimes more harshly , sometimes less . But that night she 'd ignored his slights , attributing his habits to the mysterious ways of soldiers ( he was her first ) , or to the fears instilled by war , or to her own vast ignorance . That night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , she thought only how beautiful were the buttocks of a man and how fine it was to be able to rub against that lean body ( underwear aside ) all through the night while he slept without his pulling away . He came as a gift . He did not hold her in his sleep like a husband or fit himself against her like a spoon against a spoon ; still , she was able to lay her head against his chest and throw her leg across his leg and twine her fingers in the curl of his hair without his drawing away , and over breakfast admire his magnificent uniform . " You sure do go for this uniform , do n't you ? " he had asked , catching her eyeing him , embarrassing her beyond words . ( For indeed , she did . ) Was he insulted ? " I wonder why ? " he continued . " It 's just a uniform . We all look alike in them , do n't we ? They 're all the same . " She had demurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that it was he she loved ( Steven ? Alexander ? Charles ? ) and not the uniform at all . She had loved her soldier all the night ; the feeling had been strong and new and pure ; long after the war surely ( she insisted ) she would love him again . But after the war he was gone , and what she remembered was not him but her own feelings  --  how exciting to be with him with his chevrons and medals and soldier hat perched cockily on his head ( as in the picture ) , and how thrilled she was when he touched her and how confused when he washed her away .  | There had been many others since , whose names she had also forgotten ; she had learned to spot a soldier half a mile away , for a while she could n't look at a civilian . She was sorry he had n't come back , for she had wanted to get to know him better , get him to trust her enough to hold her naked through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that terrible war had ended ( and a new one had begun ) , she knew she could always recapture the delicious secret of that wartime night simply by watching the springy walk of a dark-haired khakiclad soldier ; all it took was a photo , a uniform , a longing , a little imagination . What did the details matter ? Or even his name ? She could get the feeling now without the insult , she could have it any way she chose ; for it had happened long ago and had lodged in her soul , she had loved an unknown soldier all night long , she could feel him inside her still when she closed her eyes , he was almost certainly dead now , and she was alive . Robin had begun to consider herself one of the luckier hos on the stroll . She had been working six days a week for a month , turning more than half a dozen tricks a night , and had never once pulled a cop , a gorilla , or a freak . Not that she thought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached her . But unlike some of the sad hos in Sallee 's Coffee Shop who recounted new tragedies every day , or the human wrecks who slept in doorways reminding them all of what could happen , after a month of steady work her worst fears seemed to be unfounded , and Robin felt more oppressed by the tedium , the squalor , and the dreary hours of her profession than by the well-known dangers . Then one Tuesday night her luck changed . The night had started out slower than usual . After standing for an hour in the same doorway as always in one of her better outfits , she was still waiting for her first trick . Hot and  | bored , she lit a cigarette and gazed up at the sometimes red , sometimes blue , but now green lighted tip of the Empire State Building , thinking how like a lighthouse it was , a beacon warning passing planes that this was New York City . When a sudden breeze blew up her skirt , making it billow out like the skirt of Marilyn Monroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin imagined herself a flight attendant , walking hard against the stiff jet wind of her superliner , her hair blowing straight back as she climbs the stairs to the cockpit , just behind the pilot . Flying high , she looks down on the great lighted city and thrills to recognize below that landmark of light , the Empire State Building . The familiar green light signals to her that in another minute she will be flying directly over the scene of her own astonishing youthful triumphs . Down there , back then , when she was only sixteen , she 'd held her own among the most accomplished and wicked women in the world . She , friend of jet-setters , confidante of the famous and rich , admired , widely traveled flight attendant , had even then managed to make hundreds of dollars in a single night by being extraordinarily desirable . Men sought her out among many and paid her large sums just to be alone with her . Some , unable to resist her , returned again and again ; others tried desperately to lure her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love belonged to one to whom she would always be faithful , no matter who else might claim her . His love was her safety , her beacon , her protection , her green-tipped steady light . While she gazed up , Robin became aware that someone was watching her . She pulled herself from her dream to see a trim man of medium height with clipped brown hair , a protruding chin , and intense eyes observing her from a short distance off . She quickly returned his look and strolled toward him with her most seductive walk , preparing her standard opening . But before she could get out the words he stepped forward and accused her sharply , " You 're too young to be doing this . " Robin was puzzled . The man 's neat appearance  --  fresh  | blue shirt , well-creased trousers  --  was no guarantee that he would not harm her . Was he reproving her or coming on ? The sentiment was one she 'd heard often . Prince told her to call them Daddy and up the price when they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapprove . Prince explained how a trick 's mind worked . " Look at it this way , baby . If you do n't know a person , I mean know all about em , how their mind works , then you 're gon na believe anythin you want to about em . Take you , for instance . A trick sees you , you could be anyone from a schoolgirl to a dropout , right ? Now , that trick 's got to believe somethin about you . What 's it gon na be ? What he wants to believe . That 's why he 's pickin you . Now , if you can open him up a little , see what he wants , you can play on his idea , whatever it is . Like , he thinks you 're some poor little white gal , he 's gon na want to save you . Then you let him know you 're dyin to be saved , all you need is the cash . Another one thinks , only reason you 're on the street is you love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play it right , he 's gon na make you one rich come-freak . " Some tricks , he explained , tell themselves a young chick ca n't be a real hooker , she 's just acting like one for the fun of it , not the cake ; and some of them think if you 're very young you 're dumb enough to let yourself get taken . Without Prince to advise her about this one , Robin gave him her standard response . " Not too young to have some fun with you . " He searched her eyes , then quickly lowered his own to ask , " How much ? " " Depends on what you want to do . " He was well dressed and soft-spoken ; she went for the higher price . " Basically forty for the date and ten for the room . " He stepped up beside her , ready to follow . As she led him toward the Hotel Venus , she noticed that the clock in the window of the coffee shop showed exactly ten o'clock . They exchanged names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk David asked Vego for a room key .  | " Sorry , " said Vego , signaling Robin with his eyes . " The only room left got no lock on the door . " " Never mind , " said David and paid . Robin took the towels and proceeded down the hall . Passing the marble stairs , she wondered if the garbage piled in the courtyard had actually increased overnight or if it only seemed that way . The dump on the island was bulldozed twice a year and picked over daily by the housewives and seagulls . But this dump was never emptied . A young he-she named Alice seated on the bottom step looked up from examining his nails to whine at Robin , " Button , I broke a nail . Do you have a file I can use ? " " Later , " said Robin , patting Alice 's shoulder . The trick hurried them away . Robin might have been friends with Alice ? they were the same age , both hookers , both from far away ? if Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you messin with one a them filthy he-she hos again I got to charge you . My lady do n't talk to funny folk ! " ) In the room Robin went straight to the basin to begin soaping the cloth . " Never mind that , Button . You wo n't be needing it . I 'm not going to do anything dirty . I just want you to pull down your panties , " said David , making no move to undress himself . Either an easy trick or a pros cop , thought Robin , remembering that New York City police were not allowed to remove their pants , not even to make an arrest . Jacki had explained that massage-parlor girls avoided arrest by insisting that every customer strip as soon as he walked in . But street hos had no house rules and were n't offering massages . " Money first , " said Robin . " Sure . " David took a wallet from his pocket and counted out three tens and two fives . " What do you want me to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her skirt . " Just pull down your panties. "  | When she saw him unbuckling his belt she felt safe again . She stepped out of her underpants . But when she looked back he was still dressed , his belt was in his hand , and his body was blocking the door . " I want you to bend over , Button , because I 've got to punish you now . " He crooned his words so softly , so respectfully , it sounded almost like a song . Robin 's muscles tensed . Her father 's voice softened too when he was about to punish her . Always let the trick go into the room first , Jacki had warned . Stay between him and the door till his pants are off . But Robin had n't listened . " You do n't really want to do that , " she said . " It 's not because I want to , " said David . Her father 's very line ! " I 've got to . You 've been a very bad girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got to be punished . " She 'd always known her punishment was coming . He took a step toward her . Should she scream and bring Vego running ? But what if her voice failed her ? And who else might a scream bring ? " You do n't understand , " she said , stepping backwards . " Really , I hate doing this , but I 'm always watched . They wo n't let me leave . They force me . Right now there 's someone outside the door waiting for me , and if I scream ? " David slapped the belt against his thigh in several short strokes , like twitches . " But you 're not going to scream , because I paid you . " In the ill-lit room his eyes seemed to disappear into their sockets and his strange jaw was set hard . " Bend over , now . Robin winced with pain as she felt the metal buckle of the belt against her thigh through her thin skirt . She knew from years of experience how to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surveying the room , she made her calcula-  | tions and was amazed at how calmly she planned to lure the trick around the bed and then break for the door . Speaking fast , she said , " Okay , I 'll bend over if that 's what you want , but you 'll have to pay me more . Spanking 's a special service . I have to charge extra . " " Oh , you are a wicked one . " He swatted at her again , but this time she jumped away in time . " Oh , no , " she said , running around the back of the bed . " You have n't paid me . " With strength she did n't know she had , she shoved the bed toward him . " You ca n't do that unless you pay . " he looked indecisive . " Flow much ? " " Twenty-five more . " " Twenty-five ? For the devil 's work ? I wo n't pay the devil . I do n't have to pay you anything . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw forward belligerently and once more lashed at her with the belt , this time grazing the mattress with the buckle . She winced at the thud . " If you pay up , I 'll bend over for you . But I 'm a working girl ; I ca n't give you specials for nothing . Tell you what I 'll do , though . I 'm supposed to charge twenty-five , but I 'll make it ten dollars for you cause I like you a lot . That 's the best I can do . " She held her hand out toward him , without budging , willing him around the bed . He looked at her for a long moment , then began to respond . When his hand was in his pocket and he was advancing toward her , she scrambled across the bed and dashed for the door , practically flying down the hall and past the stairs , not stopping until she reached the street . The running music was screaming in her ears , filling her head . People were fighting down the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept in the doorway was shouting something . No one was safe . When she got her wings she would fly far away . But now she had no place to fly or even to run . Except to Prince .  | Owl saw Milly running toward her with terror in her eyes . Her heart clenched . Had the Flasher found Milly , too ? She raised herself from the step and opened up her arms . " What is it , my baby ? Tell me . What 's the matter ? " If they wanted to make her suffer , this was the way : through her child . In all other ways she had made herself strong ; but here she was weak . Bert had known it . Not enough they had hounded her out of her room into the street , now they were after Milly too . " Milly ! Stop ! " she cried , stepping forward . But it was too late . Once they were grown there was no stopping them and once they were gone there was no way ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without stopping , like a bird heading straight for the windshield . Bursting through the door , ready to tell Prince everything that had happened , Robin was crushed to find the room empty , Prince out . With her chest still heaving for breath , she collapsed into a chair and tried to think . Now , Prince would have to let her quit . She 'd take a straight job instead , anything , taking care of kids , selling , waitressing , even stripping if that was all she could get . But not hooking . If he knew how it felt to have that belt coming at her and no way out of the room , then he 'd let her quit now . . . if he loved her . He 'd even help her leave , the way her brother had helped her leave the island . Boots would understand . She rummaged through her bag till she found the old phone number , then dialed . This time a woman answered . " I 'm trying to find Boots Fergusson , " said Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers from high school . She gave me this number to call if I ever got to New York . Well , I 'm here . "  | " Well , she 's not . She 's gone to California . " " California ? " said Robin , incredulous . That was as far away as you could get . " Did she leave an address ? " " No . I have n't heard from her since she left . But if you want to leave your number , I 'll give her a message if she gets in touch . She said she would . " " No , " said Robin , " I 'll call back again . Just tell her Robin called . " She hung up in despair and lay down on the bed . Using her real name for the first time in weeks gave her a weird feeling . Robin . California . Both so far away . When she opened her eyes again some time later , Prince was standing over her looking down with his hair falling over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his breath . " What are you doin home at this hour ? It 's way past gitdown time . Why are n't you down on the street ? " She threw her arms around his neck and quickly recounted what had happened . But he shook her off , put his hands on his hips , and said , " I am really disgusted with you , Button . Totally disgusted . I thought you had guts . I thought you were comin up boss material , not just baby-pro . But if you lose your nerve and get ready to blow after your first little half-ass freak , then how 'm I ever gon na trust you ? Maybe Sweet Rudy is right about babypros . Maybe I need someone more mature , someone I can count on . " Robin stared at him . " How can you trust me ? Is it my fault I pulled a freak ? " " You been out there a whole month and you pull one freak , maybe the only one you 'll ever pull , and look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect you ? No , eleven o'clock you come runnin home . Shit , if all you want is safety , baby , you 're no different from any square . You do n't get nothin without takin a risk . You could step off a curb in front of a car .  | You could go up in flames sleepin in your bed . You could be gunned down by a cracko or picked up by the cops for sitting on a bench in the park , or you could be tracked down by your dad or ripped up by lightnin . Are you gon na lay up in bed all day long worryin ? No . These are the chances you got to take . " She listened silently , watching the muscle go in his jaw . She could hardly suggest quitting now . " Now , Button , this time you know I got to correct you or else I ai n't doin my job . I got to charge you for comin off early without my permission . I got to do this for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I do n't charge you now ? " Robin felt tears of outrage spring to her eyes . She could not believe she was to be punished for pulling a freak . Please do n't let me cry , she prayed . " Anyone else 'd whip your ass for bein outa pocket , but all I 'm gon na do is charge you this time . And you got to pay that charge , baby ; you got to find me two more bills . You got to git right back down there until you make that trap and the charge besides . " Her father would have beaten her for sure . Some of the girls claimed that a man who did n't correct you did n't really love you . She hoped being charged meant he loved her . At least he was speaking calmly again . " And if you do this tonight , if you git down and show me you 're not just a scared , half-steppin ho , then Saturday we 'll spend the whole day together . " He raised her chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own bloodshot ones . " Understand , baby ? " For the first time , she pulled away from his touch . No , she did not understand . But she could n't fight him . He watched her steadily , saying nothing , until she finally pushed her feet back into her shoes and moved toward the door . Back on the street , she lit a cigarette , searched the sky for a star , and tried to concentrate on Saturday .  | Owl opened her eyes to a glistening morning and rejoiced . Birds chirped urgent messages somewhere overhead , though the block had no trees . Sunlight glinted off shop windows and shimmered above the pavement like footlights on the day . Even the rattling of the grates as a train passed under 42d Street sounded important , like a drum roll preceding momentous celebrations . Owl stood up creakily , untied the kitten from around her waist , stretched , yawned . She felt it must be Saturday , for the summer air was thick with festivity . She accepted the cricks in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without complaint . A full-time street person now , she respected the elements . Her season of comfort was brief  --  without a room to sleep in , briefer still . Forced to wear , like a dog , her winter coat all year round ( for it had a fur collar , deep satin-lined pockets , a pile lining which cold people understandably coveted ; the embroidered label read " Pierre " ; even if she had not been forced by circumstances to vacate her room , it was hardly a garment to leave unguarded anywhere , even in summer , in a climate of harsh winters ) , she appreciated all the more a day as sparkling as this . Her bladder and belly would have to be served ( and soon ! ) , but today she would serve them out of respect , not misgiving or fear , for her body was her safest dwelling . Suddenly the meaning of the day was revealed to her . The drum roll announced her mission , as urgent as her full morning bladder pressing to be emptied . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first things first . She gathered up her bags ( with the kitten curled inside Misc . Gloria ) and searched for a place to  | pee . As she did each morning , she considered the toilet in the Hotel Venus lobby , then rejected it . Though she was well disguised from the Flasher in a brown curly wig , a hat with a feather , and an old green shawl , she saw no reason to risk recognition by the manager . He would be sure to ask insulting questions even though her rent was still paid up . She was through with furnished rooms in run-down hotels and their unjust managers , at least while the weather held . And the lobbies were as bad as the rooms . Screaming matches were always breaking out among the residents over nothing more important than which TV channel to watch , and if a fight got bad enough the manager started throwing his weight around , evicting innocent people on the spot . Just like Bert . The manager of the Midway , her last hotel , had evicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't want fires they should send up heat ; it was the manager 's own fault . Was a person supposed to freeze ? She had warned him but he had ignored her . Worse , he had laughed when she told him that there were actually icicles forming inside her room , hanging like swords from the sill beneath the window she could n't get closed . ( Naturally he laughed . His office had an electric heater , and in the lobby you could hear the pipes whistling with steam . ) " If you do n't believe me , come up to my room and see , " she 'd challenged him . " Gee , I 'm scared to go into your room . I might get stabbed by one of the swords , " he 'd answered , mocking her . So she had gone back upstairs and made a small fire fueled by useless summer clothes in the empty can she used for trash . We 'll see if he comes up now , she raged , shooing the black smoke out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was a lucky day , too , her last day at the Midway . Even now she was n't the least bit sorry , she was pleased , remembering the manager 's face . He thought she would burn  | down his whole hotel , not just a few rags . His very face resembled a hot , red flame . After he kicked her out of the Midway , she banked her rent money for the next rainy day when her check failed to arrive , then she went to the Shelter , where the sisters were understanding . They served hot thick soups with chunks of meat and beans and asked no questions . They did n't force you to empty your bags or fill out forms or disinfect , like the city shelters ; they prayed for you ; they listened ; they gave you advice when you wanted it and help with your papers ; they told you your rights ; they never laughed at you or mocked you ; they allowed you to shower , do your wash , and use the toilet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it to the Shelter in time , or even to the bus station . No matter  --  she would settle for a doorway . At the end of the block she squatted at the top of the stairs leading to the back entrance of a porn palace . Having dispensed with underwear for the summer , she could huddle inside the tent of her skirt and relieve herself without attracting attention . She watched the dark stain of urine trickle past her sneaker , down three iron stairs to a landing where it widened into a pool . In winter , she remembered , pee turned to steam as soon as it hit the pavement . That terrible winter before last when she had slept in the steam tunnels underground , she had learned what people would do for steam . Muggers and madmen lived in harmony for love of steam . The snows had come in torrents that year , but her room had so little heat that her very breath formed steam , hinting to God to send her heat . After leaving the Shelter she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bus station , and then she was ready to face the dangers of the notorious steam tunnels under Grand Central Station . Down under , hundreds of homeless men basked in the heat . Florida , she called it . Others called it Hell or the Waldorf , because you descended through a passage beside the Waldorf-  | Astoria Hotel , where rooms were a hundred dollars a night . She was terrified below : you could lose your way among the turnings or be scalded on a pipe or be robbed or even raped . But one thing the tunnels had was plenty of heat . Certain pipes were so hot that people heated cans of soup on them for dinner . Earlier that week she had cut the sleeves off sweaters to wear as warmers on her legs , leaving seven layers of vests on her bosom ; but the tunnels were so warm that instead of bundling up she gave sweaters away and folded up her coat to use as a pillow . Heat , toilet , food : the body 's necessities . Now that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the corner where she waited for a light she conjured up breakfast , wondering what Grace might have left for her . Inside Misc . Gloria the kitten was mewing . Soon she would have to return him to the alley , let him out of the bag , for he was growing large , straining at the leash . Love and lose  --  but not yet . If she provided for him , then Grace would provide for her , for there was order in the universe on such a day . Behind the door at Sallee 's she found her breakfast waiting in a white paper bag . It smelled of coffee , felt like donuts . Through the window she searched for Grace , hoping to wave her thanks , but she saw only unconscious people sitting on plastic stools at the red Formica counter , sipping coffee , huddled over newspapers , oblivious of the announced magic of this day , unaware of how quickly the past was slipping by , breaking old connections , one by one . She sighed for pity of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park where she could imagine the library a palace and , ignoring the drunks sprawled on the stately rectangles of untended lawn , enjoy her memory of the small , once splendid park ( hedges carefully pruned , borders planted with flowers , fountain dancing in the morning sunlight ) , now spoiled and gone to seed . Times had changed . She lifted the kitten from the bag , secured his leash  | under her foot , and placed before him a mound of cat food . Only then did she open her own meal . One large cardboard container of coffee ( light and sugared  --  bless Grace ! ) and two cinnamon donuts . She teased her tongue with a lick of cinnamon , then carefully raised the coffee . The aroma was nutty and titillating , strong as magic . With coffee like this , she needed nothing more to start her day , though she would n't have minded an egg . Nothing matched the concentrated protein in the white of an egg . In the DP camps , where the rations consisted of potatoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people would have killed for an egg . If she 'd still had a flatiron , she could have plugged it in and fried an egg on it whenever she pleased , even without cooking privileges . But her iron had long since been stolen , and even if she found another , she 'd have no place to plug it in . Too bad . Cholesterol of eggs was said to be bad , but she did not believe in cholesterol . Man-made poisons , yes , but an egg  --  passage from bird to the world  --  was clearly God-made . Not that she believed in God , but she did know there was something controlling the universe . She had lived long enough to see the pattern . It was something large , important , very strong . Fate , maybe ; destiny ; Nature  --  it . It was as good a word as any . It . Once , speaking of it , she 'd said , Oh , what the hell ? Why not call it God ? And the name had stuck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what difference did it make what you called it ? Whatever it was , it had set aside today for settling things with Milly . She hoped she was ready . She took a sip of coffee and a bite of donut and let them blend on her tongue . She pressed the donut to the roof of her mouth , and suddenly , there on her tongue , she felt something restorative , life-giving . Holding it against her palate , eating the gift of life , she felt a familiar rapture , a transformation approaching bliss . Gently she returned the kitten to his bag to protect the  | birds ; then she reached into a plastic bag in a paper bag in the Gloria for a handful of bread , and with a large sweep of her arm that made the old flesh quake , she scattered it joyously to the wind . There was a fine breeze blowing by the time Prince , springing on shiny cordovan shoes , tucked Robin 's hand up under his arm in her favorite way and took her walking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream and talked , as she loved , about " plans . " At a little past noon , a slender young man in black pants , black slippers , and white shirt rode a unicycle past them . Old people feeding pigeons and drug dealers setting up all followed him to the center of the park . " Come on , " said Prince . " It 's Fidelio . You gon na see somethin now . " From a black leather bag the young man Fidelio took a rope . He tied one end to the trunk of an elm , the other end to the pole of a lamp , pulled it taut , and tested it with all his weight . After tightening the slack , he flexed his muscles , donned a bowler hat , and began to juggle with impeccable style five yellow balls . " Now you gon na see a real show . " Prince danced on his toes and rubbed his hands together . " Wait . " While Fidelio juggled , the curious and knowledgeable continued to assemble . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch , tired shoppers , the unemployed . Some sipped soda , some licked ices , some stood around with their hands in their pockets watching Fidelio 's work grow fancy as he altered his rhythm and added objects to his juggling act . When a sufficiently large crowd had gathered , Fidelio gestured them back and drew a large circle around him with a piece of yellow chalk . He raised his hand and  | held the spectators behind the line with a look , then he mounted his unicycle and rode it twice around the circle , establishing his inviolable space . He bowed to all sides until the audience was in his control and then began his beautiful , intricate juggling dance . Prince stood behind Robin with his hands on her shoulders , watching Fidelio , enthralled . As far as Prince could tell , he used no shills , though he often drew the public into his act , giving them props to hold and roles to play . His investment was nothing but a few balls , some rope , four bowling pins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . That was it ; yet he could build a big audience , cast a spell over them , hold them , and keep them . They could be anyone  --  kids , businessmen , bums  --  it did n't matter ; and in half an hour several hundred folks , including Prince himself , would be just begging to give him their cake . Damn ! He 'd be stuffing his hat with it ! And afterwards , when he 'd mounted that silly wheel and disappeared , instead of feeling they 'd been had , folks would be dying to have him back again to give him more . With respect , Prince calculated the preparation that had to go into this act . Fidelio 's warm-up juggling and sleight of hand made three-card monte look like making Jell-O . He 'd heard Fidelio had been busted more than a hundred times , but it did n't seem to bother him . Nothing ever tempted him to break his front . Nothing riled him , he just kept those balls circling in the air , adding his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dancing in the air at once . How did he do it ? He was a little guy , slender , even slight . But he could discipline hecklers with a scowl , build confidence with a stare , control whoever got out of line by raising a finger or just an eyebrow . He used every part of the scene in his act . He mimicked passing dogs , babies , drunks who wandered into his space , converting each mistake to a challenge , incorporating every distraction . He was a master of con , comedy , and timing . The crowd was  | his . It was more than instructive , it was inspiring to watch so tight a game . And the climax of the act was still coming . Like a boss player , Fidelio always waited until he had his marks right in his fist  --  like now  --  before giving them what they wanted : that rope . Fidelio bowed , tested the rope again , removed his shoes , dipped four bowling pins in kerosene and tucked them under his arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lithe Tahitian youths who walked straight up the sides of the coconut palms to pick the fruit when they were thirsty or who dived into the water to spear a fish when they were hungry . Now , with one arm raised like a plume behind him and the other spread like a wing to his side , two pins in each hand , slowly , cautiously , with unfaltering grace , Fidelio slid one foot onto the rope . " Get ready , " whispered Prince , leaning down to Robin 's ear . Ready ? Oh , she was ready , she 'd been holding her breath in anticipation from the start . She did n't need Prince to tell her . Fidelio was like a bird , Robin thought  --  a graceful heron gliding through the air , or a ruddy turnstone flitting from rock to rock , or like finches on branches , one step and another and another , while waves broke distantly below . Without wings he moved across the rope to the center , then stopped . She and the crowd sucked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore . Spreading his arms for balance , he bowed his head to one side of the audience , then to the other , letting them know he took this risk for them . Fixing his gaze on one face in the crowd ( On mine ! prayed Robin , glad Prince was standing behind her and could n't see ) , carefully he lowered himself till he was resting one knee on the rope . The crowd and Robin returned their breath to the air .  | His eyes , with the will of her father 's , the charm of Prince 's , held her up in the sky . Oh , to be part of such a man ! Kneeling midair , Fidelio took a lighter from his pocket and held it to the kerosene-soaked pins . One , two  --  the tips burst into flame . Now , a dip of the arms , a prayer , and the master kneeling on a tightrope juggled the torches toward the sky . Could it be true ? Had he looked at her ? Seen her eyes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Robin , was there anything she would n't do ? She saw herself in a costume  --  a leotard , a mask  --  holding his hat , testing his rope , kissing his lips , lighting his pins , handing them up . The envy of all . Oh , her love would sustain him , and for this he would love her too . Even Prince at her elbow would have to bow to such a perfect love . Without altering his rhythm , Fidelio reached out , plucked her heart , and tossed it up until it blended with the rest . And for a little while Robin , like him , stood free of gravity , a flame dancing in the windy air . Ahead of her , through an opening in the trees , Owl thought she saw a man in the sky wearing a halo of flames , kneeling in a circle of fire . A flasher assaulting the sky ? She thought not . But then , what could it mean ? For she had seen in a vision that everything has meaning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her room she knew that everything was part of the pattern that had been revealed to her ; she felt herself in phase with the universe . Like the animals and plants , she was part of the whole . This park , the food she ate , the birds she fed , the infants she ogled in their carriages , this day that followed yesterday like a faithfully kept promise  --  all were part of the whole . Deeply she breathed the bright air of the day with its brew of bark and soot and flame , wafted to her nostrils by a  | slight breeze that marked this day as absolutely unique and unparalleled in the entire history of the universe . Once , many years before , she had been taken to a private garden on a hill in Rome . The garden had a wall , the wall had a gate , the gate had a keyhole . And through the keyhole in that garden gate she had seen the splendor of Rome with its spires and cypruses and ancient ruins , the rubble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there , in the exact center of the keyhole view , was the dome of St. Peter 's itself . A nobleman , it was said , had had the wall built ; nevertheless , through that hole in one glance she had seen the pattern of part and whole , past and present , dome and spire , earth and fire , that held together the universe . And now  --  this breeze : part of this moment and also of all the breezes that ever sailed around the earth in all former moments and now connected the cloud blowing toward the noonday sun ( she sneezed to look at it ) with the halo of flame through the trees , image of the sun ( she sneezed again ) . He was tossing the flames around his head , and as the breezes passed through the branches the flames dipped and danced . The very breeze that now blew a kiss up her skirt and kissed her knees and neck fanned the flames . The breeze did not avoid old women . On her neck the skin responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames leaped . As a wave of prickles flashed through her in one erotic shudder she was one with the flame , one with the quiver of leaves ( green to silver to green again ) , one with the crumpled papers , wrappers of straws , and straws themselves that held the touch of lips and scooted across the ground , one with the universe . She gathered up her bags and walked toward the man of flame . A yellow circle enclosed him and held her back . At the edge of the circle she stopped ; and seeing all the eyes bound in the circle , she began to see the meaning of the flame . It was the dome of St. Peter 's , the melody , even the scream which , once screamed , joined all the other gusts and hurricanes and  | cries to make a universal wind , flame , breath of life , voice of God . Of this she was quite certain , because there  --  there ! ? was Milly . The magic held . She now knew what she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held it close to her cheek one last time , letting him watch the fire . At last Fidelio leaped to the ground . In one sweeping movement he smothered the flames of the pins in an asbestos cloth and bowed . The crowd applauded wildly . Fidelio placed his shoes back on his feet and his hat back on his head and with one upheld palm stayed the crowd . No one moved . Robin blushed and held her breath , knowing he 'd soon be coming near . She wondered , Will he remember me ? He tipped his bowler , crown over brim , down the steps of his lean body  --  nose , chest , elbow , wrist  --  into his hand . Then he stepped nimbly to the edge of the circle and began circulating with his hat outstretched . " Now this is the best , " said Prince , shifting his weight from one foot to the other . " With one hand he can keep the whole crowd from walkin off free . God damn ! See them just dyin to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pocket and gave two of them to Robin . She waited for her turn , wondering what she would say . With Prince beside her she could say nothing . She longed to toss her soul into Fidelio 's hat , her body into his arms . But when he was finally beside her holding his hat to her , she could only drop her coins in the hat and look one last time into his eyes . At that moment , as Fidelio moved on toward Prince , someone thrust a kitten into Robin 's arms . It was an old  | woman with gnarled hands , a missing tooth , and a mad look on her face . " Take him , take him , there 'll be more ? , " she said and moved quickly away . Robin wanted to follow her , but now Fidelio was moving back into the center of the circle . He tossed the dancing balls in the air for one last act , a virtuoso play . Then quickly he untied his rope , packed up his pins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder , steadied his unicycle , and bowed a final , appreciative bow . While the crowd continued to applaud , he gestured them to open up a path for him . He mounted his wheel , backed up to the edge of the circle , and with his hands folded behind his back rode across the circle , through the crowd , out of the park . " What 's that ? " asked Prince when Fidelio was gone . " A kitten . Is n't it the sweetest thing you ever saw ? " " Where 'd you get it ? " " I do n't know . Someone just handed it to me and disappeared . " " Handed it to you ? " Robin shrugged . " Too many kittens born , I guess . People must have a hard time getting rid of them . At home they leave them in boxes on the steps at school . Is n't it dear ? " Prince looked at it suspiciously . " You 'll let me keep it , wo n't you ? Please ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cool , and vowed , remembering her father , If he says no , I 'll run away . Prince shrugged . " A cat , is it ? " " Please , Prince . Please . " He shrugged again . " Sure , baby , if you want it , keep it . If a cat makes you happy , keep it . I want to see you happy . "  | When the scream began Owl believed it was her own voice defending herself from the Flasher . Still ? Again ? She tried to wake up and protect herself , but she could n't ; instead she watched the dream change until the sound came from the infant Milly , crying for her four o'clock feeding . The stench of garbage from two full cans beside the doorway she slept in called forth dream memories of diaper smell ; the high-pitched wail from the hotel across the street made her dry breasts yearn to help ; the very hour of night ( for ever since she 'd nursed Milly in the rocker while Bert slept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back to that deceitful time when an infant at her breast made her feel the future a high , pink , cloudless sky . Since she 'd moved to the street , her dreams lasted only a moment . Now , in this one , when Milly cried , Owl leaped from the bed , dripping milk from her breasts , to suckle the child . But the basket she kept her baby in was filled with rags . Where was the baby ? Frantically she began to search through the rags as her power leaked out through her nipples . Between two worlds , Owl reached for the Susan bag and felt inside for her glasses . The night gave off its eerie green cast ; Owl was cold , even under layers of wraps . She wondered if the wail from across the street was the same scream she 'd loosed on the Flasher , become one now with the countless other voices in an unending fugue that played on , night after night . The cries of the wounded soldiers , the displaced persons , the infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , the junkies , the cats , herself . Had the Flasher returned ? She tried to sing an air , her part in the fugue , but her voice faltered .  | A moment later she heard a thud , as if a large bag of garbage had struck the pavement , special delivery , bringing the song , the scream , to an end . Coda . Thud . End . Now the street became deathly quiet . Owl huddled inside her coat under the green light and pulled her shawl close around her . She tried to sleep , but with the first hint of dawn she opened her eyes and remembered . A scream , a thud , something airmailed to the pavement , night people stepping around it in the eerie green light . A body ? An egg fallen from the nest ? An infant flung against a wall ? Bad dreams ? There was something on the pavement across the street . She stretched out her swollen legs and laboriously picked herself up . She reset her wig on her head , covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and assembled her bags . A workman in cap and apron walking past the hotel detoured slightly around the heap . Another pile of clothing discarded in the glut ? Owl thought of all the dead , discarded things she passed each day . She had to pee , but first she would investigate . She made her way across the street . In the chilly gray Manhattan dawn , there on the pavement , partially hidden by trash , she saw the broken body of a child . A small adolescent child with a broken neck , face smashed on the pavement , arms akimbo , dirty nails , yellow hair , bloody head . Milly ? Owl reached down and lifted away the hair covering what remained of the face . The child 's mouth hung open and her eye stared out like the eye of a fish , the limbs were bent at an inhuman angle , as if they were floating in a smooth blue lake in which the water 's surface bent the shapes beneath . The knees were skinned and bloody , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . The time Milly fell out of the swing and split her scalp , the blood poured out ; I thought her skull had cracked open , finished her . I picked up my baby , ran inside , wrapped her in a blanket ,  | and desperately tried to reach Bert . Calling , calling , busy wire , dial again , finally through . But he was n't at his office , the secretary did n't know where he was . And when I called him from the hospital emergency room he still was n't there . I called him again and again but he was never there . He was never there , not once , when I really needed him . Owl thought of the dead birds , the wasted lives . The boy , her firstborn , dead after three days ; she never even got to take him home . She wanted to salvage this one , take her home ? but she had no home . She would have to leave her here . Bert could bury her . I should never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempting fate . There I lay on a long sterile table under a spotlight , legs in stirrups , waist distended while a medium in a white coat listened to my navel through a stethoscope . Was it my own wild heartbeat spilling over ? No  --  definitely a separate pulse . Alive ! Well , why not a name , then ? A mistake . In the fifth month I stained ; when I smoked my gums bled . Then one September morning the pains came , a whole season too soon . I 'd been expecting them anyway . The book said : to prevent contractions , pant . All the way to the hospital and onto the ward I panted like a sunstruck hound ; they could n't get me to stop . But the pains kept coming , weak but persistent , like the creature that followed them nine hours later , a perfect little miniature . " Is it alive ? " I asked . " Yes , " said Bert , sitting on my clean sheets looking down at me . " He 's alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes three times a day , straight from the incubator . We kept looking at each other . Beautiful huge trusting eyes . Then one evening I asked , " Is he still . . . ? " And from the look on Bert 's face I knew he was dead . Nothing left but the  | footprint they took when he was born , and I never spoke his name again . Owl reached down and touched the cheek . It was cold . Too late , too late , too late . Her tears fell freely this time . She had waited too long , thinking there 'd be time enough ; but there was never time enough . For how many years had she and Milly been out of touch , except for a card at Christmas ? She 'd given her a kitten , but it had n't helped ; Bert bided his time , then took Milly away . This time too : A kitten and then . . . Gone . Everything repeated . She 'd given her a kitten but it had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would it have saved her ? But she 'd been afraid to impose . Always afraid . And now ? Too late . Now she would have to drop her suit . What would be the point with no one to carry on , no one to leave her treasures to ? She lifted her own brown wig from her matted hair and placed it over the bloody head . She would try to get a blond one from the Shelter , but for now the brown one would have to do . She took off her shawl and covered the body , though it was already quite cold . How many times would she bury Milly before she was through ? Too many . Too late . The bad vibes hit him the minute he walked into the Casanova Bar . The dim lights behind the bar seemed dimmer than usual . The TV was off , the jukebox was silent , and the airconditioner hummed eerily . The players had left their fancy threads behind and no one was laughing . The place was practically empty , just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar with grim faces talking very soberly , very low , without a glimmer of their usual flash . No one selling bracelets or cameras or radios ; no couples in the back ; not even any johns . Sweet Rudy , who usually sported outrageous boots and covered his black balding head with a fancy hat , now wore only work shoes and a tweed workman 's cap . Prince put his  | hands in his pockets and ambled down to the group at the end of the bar , taking a fast reading of his stomach on the way : bad news . Sweet Rudy threw his arm over Prince 's shoulder . " Let me buy you a drink , bro . I thought it was your people when I heard the news . Man , I 'm glad it 's not . " Prince checked the room in the long mirror behind the bar . Not one woman in the place . Something was wrong . Forget the stomach ; he needed a drink right now . " Thanks , Sweet Rudy . Run it down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ordered a Scotch as the men gathered to tell the story . It seemed a white ho , street name Vicki , was found dead on the pavement in front of the Hotel Venus . No one really knew what had happened , but under her brown wig Vicki was blond , blue-eyed , and not a day over fourteen . The cops were all over the stroll , and in another hour Father Glendon would be holding a press conference . Reporters and photographers would be down , camera crews would be swarming everywhere , politicians would get into it , before night a grand sweep would be on and it would be open season on pimps . Prince felt his body stiffen . ' Whenever there was trouble with a ho it was open season on pimps . Just when he had a little money saved , just when he was getting ready to lift his game , something like this happened . Every time you moved up you got pushed back down . Before he even got born his father ran off , leaving him to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suffer just to keep them alive sent him back to start . In the service , where he finally got some of the pussy and cash coming to him , his own stomach betrayed him . Goodbye , navy ; goodbye , Tahiti . Even his wife turned against him when the cash was low , stealing his son , trying to stick him for alimony . Not one step up without two steps down . Running his best game laid him up in the joint .  | Just as he settled back into the life , Sissy , that bitch , whom he thought he could trust , disappeared out of state . And now ? He should have known the day he turned Button out that a sweep would be coming down . He slammed his fist on the heavy bar so hard the pain shot up through his arm . " Shit , man . I 'd like to kill the gorilla who 's pollutin the game , drawin the heat down on everyone . Pimpin 's a mind game , not a muscle game . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " " Hold on , " said Sweet Rudy , smoothing down his mustache . " You do n't know she was pushed . Maybe she jumped . She was a kid , you know , maybe she was speedin . If she was a dog , maybe she checked out on her own . Mighta been an accident , you do n't know . " " I was there when the heat came . I saw her , " said Shorty , sipping a beer . He waited till everyone had turned to listen . " It was really weird . She was all twisted up , with everything broken , her neck and her legs and her arms , like someone really wanted to mess her up . Twisted like a pretzel , you know ? With a curly brown wig setting on top a her head . Weird , man . But they found her covered up with some kinda blanket , or some kinda shawl , like someone wanted her to die comfortable and look neat . Like someone was sorry for what he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who that got ta be ? That got ta be some freaked-out crazy trick . Right ? " " Yeah , nine times outa ten it 's a freaked-out trick , " said Sweet Rudy . " A pimp can cut a bitch loose easier than droppin her out a window and bringin the heat down on everyone . " As Prince saw it , it did n't matter . Whether she fell or jumped or got pushed out the window , she was young and white and the heat was on . Tricks never got busted . Tricks were the lifeline of the life  --  no con without marks  --  but the man always played right past them . When one of them got violent , the man just clicked his tongue and called the trick  | crazy . But if a player turned up with a new set of wheels , the man was ready to lock him away . No one even knew who this Vicki was , much less how she checked out ; but the man was out to get himself some pimps to burn anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their operations or how to lay low till the sweep was over and the heat was off . They were taking their women to Miami and Atlantic City , Boston and Vegas , or over to Jersey City . Not Prince . Button was too young to take out of the state and too hot to work in the city , even in Queens . Bad risk . If they busted her now they 'd do everything to make her finger him . He 'd have to get into something fast or they 'd be out of money in a week . Sweet Rudy put his hand on Prince 's arm . " We 're all cuttin out tomorrow for Boston . I got somethin goin there , you know ? I 'll run it down for you and you can tell me if you want to come . " Prince shrugged . If the sweep went on for a couple of weeks he 'd be right back where he started , with no cake , no one on the bricks , no work of his own , alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , man . " Maybe he 'd never get past today , tomorrow , and one day more . " Leave the young stuff here and bring yourself . Let Button visit her mother for a while . We 'll be back in a few days , soon as it 's safe , " said Sweet Rudy . Prince wondered if he dared leave Button now . Sometimes he dreamed of a different life  --  moving up into some legitimate game , living in a real house with a family , fruit trees , a yard to fix up , his lady so tight with him he could just relax backstage , instead of being onstage every minute . But he knew it was a dream . A blow to the heart kills , Sweet Rudy had told him , and Prince kept it in his own heart as a motto . A blow to the heart kills . Let that woman open you up and you were on your way down . She 'd be tricking off you the next day , gaming on you that night , destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her strike a blow to your heart and you 'd be just another trick , free fucking , used , wasted . He wondered what Button had heard about the accident and if she knew the chick . He had to get back and calm her . If she was n't too shaky , maybe he could go to Boston with his buddy . But he had to think out his plan . " Thanks , Sweet Rudy . I 'll let you know later . You planning to be at home ? " " If I 'm not there leave a message for me here with Tony . I 'll be by for my messages . " Prince felt his stomach starting up . He needed some milk . " Thanks , " he said , clasping Sweet Rudy 's hand . Then he left an extra large tip for Tony on the bar . For good luck . They 'd all need it . Who was Vicki ? All afternoon the whores sat in Sallee 's Coffee Shop huddled together over coffee at a table in back , avoiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out what was coming . Who was the dead girl ? Even after carefully pooling their stories , they knew almost nothing about her . Someone said she 'd been on the stroll for nearly a year . Robin was shocked . A whole year here and no one knew her ? No one knew Robin either , but she 'd been there only a month . By the time a year went by she supposed she 'd be living differently . She looked at the five other hookers at the table . The most she knew of any of them was their street names , their home states , their old men , and how long they 'd been in the life  --  about as much as they knew about the dead girl . Her street name was Vicki , her man ( though some said she did n't have one ) had conveniently disappeared . She was a lot younger than she looked . She liked to wear little ruffled tops and tight skirts in shocking colors . Though she was reported in the papers to  | be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown wig . ( Funny . ) No one had claimed the body yet , but a family had been traced and was supposedly on the way from somewhere out West . One paper said there were seventeen warrants out on her . Another paper said she was only twelve years old . Quietly , Robin listened to the women talk . Lana ( California ) speculated wildly ; Pearl and Sugar ( New York ) wept , wadding handfuls of tissues in their laps . Jacki ( Virginia ) was being practical ( " Give me a quiet old geezer anytime . They 're too weak to kill you " ) , and Cheryl ( New Jersey ) seemed to be speeding on the sheer excitement . " Of course , I 'm really sorry about Vicki , it 's a real tragedy ; but as long as there 's heat here , Bluejay is taking me to see my sister in Louisville . Boy , can I use the vacation ! " Robin was subdued . Like Vicki , Robin was young , white , unknown . Like Vicki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Vicki , she was a runaway , probably wanted by police at home . But for all the parallels , Robin could not mourn . Pearl , the large woman beside her with a pervasive smell of spice and soft , powdered cheeks , kept offering Robin tissues . She was one of the copious weepers whose tears made Robin feel acutely embarrassed for her own dry eyes . All the buildings fronting Eighth Avenue flanking the Hotel Venus had been cordoned off , bringing to sudden scrutiny the cracked , shaded windows , the sagging sills , and the staring faces behind them . Now suddenly the neighborhood was flooded with uniformed police looking for suspects and private detectives looking for lost daughters . From every paper headlines announced that across the city sex was for sale . Newly noticed and newly deplored . The mayor had ordered a special task force to investigate youth ; slum clearance projects were fished out of the files ; little-known ordinances were invoked ; photographers and cameramen stalked the streets ; a sergeant was suspended , a lieutenant was promoted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Authority ; the Council committed emergency funds ; and the dreaded Pimp  | Squad was assigned three additional cars , ten in personnel , and an executive mandate . The whole neighborhood , usually so cocky , had been quietly subdued . The movie palaces on 42d Street conducted business-as-usual and the buses arrived and departed from the Port Authority more or less on schedule , but the normally tumultuous streets and bars seemed abnormally quiet . Now no hawkers hustled outside the Live Sex Paladium , only one silent ticket taker covered the door ; the Casanova Bar and Grill was all but deserted ; Rena Ray , the topless dancing star of the famous Riviera , was fired after calling in sick ; the pimps and girls , big time and small time , were lying low . The Lighted Way , the religious bookstore , kept its doors open extra hours , but many other establishments were slowing down or closing up for a while as the sweep spread . The big question still was , What had happened ? Though someone was always popping into Sallee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you read in the papers . Had Vicki fallen , leaped , or been pushed ? No one knew . No note had been found , but who knew what she 'd been on ? The press was playing up the angle that she 'd been shoved and reported all the usual rumors about violent quarrels with her pimp , about kidnapping , rape , detectives on her trail , about a furious father , about arrests , about attempts to escape ; but no one really knew . And what if one day I happen to " fall " from my window , thought Robin , who would care ? She wondered if and how they 'd be able to discover who she was . Would Prince , like Vicki 's man , refuse her body ? Yes , she knew he would refuse . He loved her now , but if she were dead , if they were after him , if there was a sweep , if the action was out of town , he 'd have to split . For a moment she saw her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her own ; she saw her father , at last abject ; she saw her brothers , ashamed , teased , and taunted in school ( Robin , Robin was a whore , / She 's not fucking anymore ) . She was n't sorry for her father but she would  | have done anything to spare her brothers that humiliation . Like Vicki , she was only one fall from exposure . Vicki 's family was coming from the ' West ; her name was in all the papers ; her hometown was probably celebrating with laughter and sneers . No one had heard of her yesterday , but now the women in Sallee 's all spoke her name easily , as if they had always known her : " She always had a smile , you know ? A bright word to say to everyone , even though her man treated her like shit . God knows why she put up with it , " said Pearl , dabbing at her red eyes . " She should have left him ages ago . I would 've , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Oh , yes , thought Robin enviously , you would . You do n't need anyone . But Prince says you 're getting old , Jacki . You 'll need someone , too , one of these days . ) " No you would n't , " said Sugar , " not if you was just a little kid with no mama and nowheres else to go . " " Yeah , some folks , they be born a ho ; some folks ai n't never been treated nice one day in their life . " " She musta been stashin , holdin out on her man . " " You sure she was n't shooting up ? " " She looked a lot older than twelve to me . Where 'd they get twelve , anyhow ? " " From papers they found . " " By her teeth . " " From her mother , who 's coming for the body . " " I remember , " said Lana , " she never could stand still . Kept running back and forth , up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me she thought she 'd be going home for Christmas . Christmas ! That 's half a year off . " " Is n't she the kid who always had chewing gum ? She used to offer me some when we were working , I think that was her . I liked her , you know ? "  | " Is n't she the one who took on Bruzer , that freak trick ? Well , let me tell you about him ! " Which was worse ? Robin suddenly wondered . To be exposed when you die , or to die unknown to anyone but a few whores who thought they saw you yesterday ? " Yesterday she was crying in the Casanova Bar . " " Yesterday she knocked off early , I wonder why ? " " She said she had a headache . " " I tried to warn her . " " I had a feeling . " " I just knew something like this would happen . " " Yesterday she was alive , but now she 's dead , " said Pearl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know what 's going to happen . "  | That night Prince brought Robin a gold S-chain bracelet . ( Probably hot , but what did she care ? ) Since he was going away " for a few days , " he let her get very stoned and took her out to a new disco in Queens . The club , lined with billows of deep blue satin and thousands of tiny reflecting mirrors , was dotted with people from the life , including Prince 's running partner , Sweet Rudy , and two of his ladies , Jacki and Lana . Prince was more openly affectionate than he 'd been since their first days together . It seemed to Robin he held on to her hands nearly the entire night , across the table , dancing on the dance floor , even on their way back to the parking lot . She was proud to be with him there . She was proud of the way he danced , the special way he stood in his perfectly creased pants and black silk shirt with the red satin trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , the muscles she could see and feel under his fitted clothes . He held her eyes with his while they danced and made her feel so proud and pretty that once , laughing , he taunted her with , " Hey , I wonder if you care about me or just wan na front me off ? " All the way back to Manhattan she wanted to go on holding hands , it made her feel so safe . But he was a busy driver , forever adjusting the windows and vents , using the window washer , changing the music , weaving in and out of traffic like a skater . It was after four when they got back to their apartment at the Royal Arms . The cat was asleep on their bed . Robin wanted to chase him off before Prince had the chance . Prince was funny about the cat . When he bothered to notice him , he often found  | him amusing . The first time they gave him a ball of catnip , for example , Prince was so impressed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking it , batting it wildly with his paws , rolling over and over with it on the floor , then leaping with it from wall to wall  --  that he invited Sweet Rudy and Jacki to come over and " see a kitten with a catnip Jones . " For a week thereafter he gave the kitten a fresh dose of catnip every night and joked with Sweet Rudy about selling tickets to the show and raking in the bucks . But soon he got bored with the performance , turning his attention from catnip to coke , and ignored the animal except when he saw him violate his rules . Prince tried to be strict in the exercise of discipline , even with a cat . Sensing this , Robin tried to keep the two apart , though usually the cat disappeared on his own as soon as Prince appeared . " I should pack tonight , " said Prince , unbuttoning his shirt . " But shit , I 'm too tired . I 'll do it in the morning . " Robin was glad he was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he 's really going away then he has to make love to me tonight . If she kept him up late enough , then maybe in the morning he 'd oversleep and decide not to go at all . He lit up a joint and handed it to her while he stripped to his yellow underwear and carefully hung up his clothes , taking special pains with the creases in his pants . Long and deeply she drew on the reefer , wanting to be quickly stoned again , wanting not to think about his leaving her . She was glad not to have to go to the Hotel Venus for a while , but she was afraid to be left alone in this city with no one but a cat to talk to . He helped her out of her dress , ran his fingers softly across her breasts , pausing over her nipples , and down her hips , sheathed in the lace-trimmed satin slip he had bought for her . " You 're very sexy for a kid , you know ? Go and wash yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powder her body . She saw the glow of her own excitement on her face in the mirror . When she returned , Prince was sitting  | in his yellow underwear in the wooden chair with his feet up on the table , one hand holding the reefer , the other behind his head , his gaze off in some distant place . The radio was turned low . She knelt on the floor beside him . She laid her head upon his smooth thigh and took four good hits of the joint . She let her mind go blank to everything but this man , this thigh against her cheek . Stoned , she ran her fingers slowly up and down the long , smooth limb in time to the music until all the feeling in her body was concentrated in her cheek leaning on that thigh . Prince moved his fingers to the back of her neck and with small , slow , circular strokes caught her rhythm . His penis began to stir and rise beneath the yellow shorts , like a thick stalk of purple kelp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moved , she pulled aside the yellow curtain of his fly and released him . Deep inside , Robin felt herself stirring . She moved her fingers to his cock . If she could make him happy , would he stay with her ? She had no other power . She ran her tongue along the back of his cock , feeling the heat of her own loving , and up over the mushroom 's ridge . She slid her lips slowly down over it . When his fingers tensed on her neck in a sign , she began to move her mouth slowly up and down , like a buoy in calm waters , feeling the delicate skin of him against her tongue and throat . After a while she glanced up . His head , thrown back against the chair , was perfectly still . His hands hung limp , his mouth fell slightly open , his eyes were closed . Was he giving or withholding ? She wanted to see him respond , to know where he was , but he remained still . She felt in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were melting together inside her , becoming one smooth flow . She pressed her pelvis against his hard leg as she sucked him , feeling a pleasure , a melting pleasure , she wanted to save . She willed the feeling never to stop . After a long while Prince sat up , leaned over , and kissed  | her full on the mouth . He ran his tongue inside her mouth and over her lips , sucking gently , softly pulling her breath into his mouth , then blowing it back again . Then he lifted her in his arms and carried her to the bed . They dropped their clothes to the floor . Then he lay with his face buried in her thighs and began to kiss , then lick , her cunt . Though she had stopped coming since the night she pulled a freak and Prince had punished her , she moaned to let him know how she treasured this caress , this sign that he cared to please her . He stopped too soon and moved on top of her , abruptly ending her pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was forbidden . According to the pimping code , as much as a woman desired that caress , that much must a player withhold it . To her a little was the same as a lot , since she could never have enough ; she was always ready to begin again . It was for this reason that she allowed him to believe , as he pumped himself up toward his own explosion , that she was exploding too . The pleasure she felt with him was more than she 'd ever known ; she would n't endanger it with intimations of failure or even restraint . At last he came . " That should tighten you up till I get back , " he said , kissing her forehead and rolling away . Sometimes , after Prince rolled away from her to the edge of the bed to sleep facing the wall , her mother would appear to her , drink in one hand , cigarette in the other , standing on the high deck , thin , delicate face staring far over the sea to the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Prince ? You asleep ? " " Ca n't be asleep if you 're talkin now , can I ? " She feared to ask her question , but she had to . " Ca n't I go with you tomorrow ? "  | " No , baby , you ca n't . Too risky . " " Then , if you 're worried about crossing out of state with me , ca n't I take a bus and meet you there ? " He lay still , with his back to her . " I told you . I do n't want anythin messin us up now when there 's so much heat . I 'll be back . You rest yourself up here , read some books , take it easy till I get back . " He reached over to the table beside the bed and lit a cigarette . " But if you do n't want me working , why ca n't I rest up in Boston with you ? I just want to be with you . " The muscle in his jaw started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of with your brains . You better leave the thinkin to me . " He got out of bed , crossed to the window , and stood there smoking , looking out . His face was lit by harsh neon light . He looked tired to Robin , tense , muscle weary , like the exhausted fishermen who chased the herring up and down the coast , laying and pulling their huge nets every night for weeks , until the fish escaped to deeper waters where the hunters could not pursue them . " I 'm afraid , " she said from the bed . He turned to her and , with the strained patience of a teacher who knows he must go through the lesson one more time , folded his arms and asked , " What 's the trouble now ? " She knew she was out of bounds pestering him , but she could n't help it . " I do n't know . What if something happens while you 're gone ? " " What if , what if . What if the city blows up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us or do n't I ? I 'm leavin you money , I 'll phone you every night , nothin 's gon na happen if you do like I say . " When the herring were running , her father turned mean . Six or more fishermen sat in their house playing poker and drinking whiskey and eating sandwiches that her mother fixed  | them all night long , waiting to hear where the fish had been spotted . Sometimes they waited a week or even two , talking about the big money to be made , while the tension of the hunt mounted . When the fish were sighted the men leaped into action , becoming one person , manning the boats , racing through treacherous seas to spread their giant nets for that once-a-year , multithousand-dollar haul . Sometimes they won , sometimes they in Boston , an older one whom he liked better and was free to travel with  --  what would happen to her ? He was taking his things ; the rent was paid up ; he had his wheels . " How do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . " I 'm gon na play right past your worries , baby . We ai n't got time for jealousy . I 'm leavin you here because I got to , it 's the best thing for us , no other reason . Now , turn over , close your eyes , and let me hold you the way you like . Close your eyes and get some sleep and leave the worryin to me . " Owl sat in a side pew toward the back of St. Agatha 's Church where she could pile her bags beside her without attracting attention and weep for Milly . She loved the slow , sure , ceremonial pomp of funerals , the way the light through the stained-glass windows spilled jewels on the stone floor , the church 's deep respect for age , dignity , death . She took comfort in the knowledge that she and everyone gathered there were in communion . The rich organ music , now low and ominous , now high and serene , that caused the pews to vibrate as it filled the church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred her deeply . She remembered her grandmother 's parlor in winter with Aunt Rose at the piano and all her aunts singing in harmony , and then that other time when  | red-nosed weepy aunts and angry uncles reeking of alcohol clasped Lilly to their bosoms , squeezing and wailing , placing wet , boozy kisses on her cheeks , and Aunt Rose played the organ at the funeral . Even as the mourners , the neighborhood regulars , the religious , and the old gathered in the church , spreading themselves on the hard wooden benches like birds on branches , Owl gave herself up without shame to her most extravagant feelings , the pure contemplation of life and death . How easily the tears flowed now . In her youth she had witnessed terrible acts without feeling or understanding : a burning house , beggars in the streets , humiliated children , bombed cities . But now , the slightest thing could move her . One golden leaf still clinging to the branch , its color heightened by decay , one alley cat licking another 's ears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trash that reminded her of something gone , and her tears would well up and overflow her lids . She cried for kindness , for sadness , for no reason ; she cried for memory and loss , for Milly and the boy , for life and death . Sometimes she wondered if she did n't suffer some physical defect to produce so many tears . Her mother had cried whenever she read aloud . Whatever the book , at a certain point she would have to stop and blot her tears in order to see the next words on the page . Scrupulously she explained away her tears so Lilly would know it was n't sadness or even the story that made her cry but some peculiar connection between voice and ducts . Then she had died . Father Glendon in his black robes walked solemnly to the pulpit . Now the service would begin . Owl raised her black veil and looked around for Bert . He had n't come . Well , had n't she known he would n't ? Had he ever been where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All the more comforting was Father Glendon 's tall , lean presence , his gaunt features , his velvet voice . He , at least , would do his duty ; he was not a man to wait  | until you had made yourself over and then , with a fanfare of lies , disappear . But she was growing confused . Had n't all this happened before ? The music was music she 'd known before , the incense , the candles , were comfortingly familiar . They opened their books to page 267 and sang a hymn that merged with other hymns ; among the pews people wept tears that flowed into rivers of other tears . And now he spoke of " holy unity . " Owl sank herself deep into unity and remembered her grandmother 's house in Buffalo the night her mother died . One moment the house was throbbing like Christmas , with all her aunts and uncles talking at once ; the next moment her grandmother was flinging herself onto the high-backed velvet sofa , and there were screeches and moans and grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic of her grandmother 's house . A clock ticked loudly on the bureau , the rocker in the corner where she laid her clothes threw frightening shadows on the wall . Aunt Rose had told her her mother 's heart had stopped because someone had put her to sleep while her brother was being born but had forgotten how to wake her up . Forgotten how ? Lilly was afraid that if she slept , the clock would stop and with it her own heart and she would never wake up . After a while she heard her papa 's voice downstairs . She stole down the attic stairs and sat on the familiar landing from which she could watch the others in the parlor below . Papa sat on a chair with his head in his hands . He looked so unhappy , she wanted to run down and comfort him and make him laugh . But they were talking about her , so she sat on the stairs and listened . " Who will take Lilly ? " " Rose says she 's willing . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilda is farther , but at least Hilda has the space . "  | " Why do n't we see what Mama thinks ? " " Mama ? No , she 's too upset , we can settle this ourselves . Do n't ask Mama ! There 's no tragedy in life worse than burying a child before her time . " Later , after Lilly had returned to the attic , Aunt Hilda slipped into bed beside her . Her aunt 's tears wet the pillow , her sobs pierced the night . All through the house where people slept , sounds of mourning broke in on the steady tick of the clock . Lilly thought that if she closed her eyes not only she but all of them might die in their sleep . Bravely she sat vigil , watching the clock 's big green hand drag the little one slowly behind it , moving minute by minute across the night , until at last the black sky began to lighten through the window of that small attic room . The rocker became a chair once more , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened , gradually the clatter of hoofs and wheels and horns from the tradesmen 's carts and cars began to fill the street as they did each day . Aunt Hilda , waking , took Lilly in her arms and told her she would have to go home and put on her best clothes for the funeral . It was then Owl first observed that though everything had changed , nothing had changed . Now , Father Glendon delivered his eulogy . His voice rose like a flame , curled against the high arches , leaped from the walls causing Owl to suffer once more that worst of tragedies , burying a child before her time . The name of the departed was not Milly , but what difference did it make what he called her ? Owl had been born Lillian , had taken her husbands ' names , was now known as Owl , yet she was the same . She had called Milly many names herself . The dead were one . ( Holy unity . ) The organ was playing softly , sadly , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stood nodding gravely just outside the door . Owl collected her bags and followed . When she reached the door she welcomed the feel of
