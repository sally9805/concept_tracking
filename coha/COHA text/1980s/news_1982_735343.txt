txt This past winter was so foul here , and spring took so long to arrive , that when the weather finally turned warm it seemed only fitting to write something that necessitated a long walk around town . Maybe it was time to go see how construction was coming on the Vietnam Veterans ' Memorial : I could stare into the ditch on the mall and ruminate about how the fights over its design had been a veritable mirror of the national debate on the Vietnam war itself I tried this thesis of mine out on my neighbor . Judith Waldrop Frank , a Washington history buff . She informed me that the " veritable mirror " idea was no big deal . The physical city of Washington . she lectured me kindly , is nothing if not a running record of America 's political debates and fashions . First of all , the capital was established in 1791 in a new town apart from any existing political jurisdictions : the American planners had looked across the ocean at the French Revolution and recoiled from the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was supposed to be a sanctuary for lawmakers , " Mrs. Frank explained , " not the turf of anyone who might decide to throw a rock through a window . " But this high idea of republican virtue was n't what accounted for the city 's grand Capital Chronicle by Suzanne Garment public buildings . " That was from George Washington , " Mrs. Frank recounted . " People followed George Washington in part because he flew the flag so bravely . This was a man , remember , who went to the Continental Congress dressed up in his uniform from the French and Indian Wars . He was someone who knew the importance of display , and he was the reason for the tremendous imperial scale of this city . " L'Enfant . George Washington 's architect , expressed this idea for him . L'Enfant grew up at Versailles . surrounded by its conscious decision to involve the imagination with magnificence . Washington got to know him when he put on pageants for Washington during the revolution . L'Enfant built the props , like the victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " L'Enfant was the Busby Berkeley of the 18th Century , designing circuses for people who mattered . The genius of George Washington was to expand the definition of who mattered . And Washington 's notions of democratic magnificence won out in this city over Jefferson 's yen for the small . " But that was only the beginning of the debates , she said . Next came the question of how high a value this country was going to place on the maintenance of political order . " That question got asked through the debate that went on for years in this city over the merits of Greek versus Roman architecture  --  embodying the Greek ideals of beauty , pliability and creativity , versus the Roman notions of a harder . masculine , systematizing political spirit . It 's amazing how well the Romans came out in the controversy . Montgomery Meigs , who built Washington 's aqueduct system in the 1850s. said that the Roman republic was all very nice , but he would like to be remembered with as much respect and affection as the Roman emperors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their system of aqueducts . " It 's interesting that he could say that , and interesting that you can see the Roman influence as late as the Lincoln Memorial in 1926 . " But meantime , " she continued . " another rivalry was brewing . The partisans of Greece and the partisans of Rome agreed with one another that they had to hold the line against the encroachment of Gothic architecture upon the city . The substantial completion of the Smithsonian building in Gothic style in 1855 meant they had failed . Gothic became so chic that at one point it was proposed as the architectural style of the nation . The American system , you see , had already solved enough public problems so that it was safe to retreat to the private life . The richness of this private world  --  and its sentimentalism ? were what the Gothic style expressed . " It faded by the end of the century , and another movement began leaving its monuments in Washington : the city beautiful movement , child of the professional architects . This bunch built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificence for the politicians , but the pill underneath was that the architects were carrying out a democratization of the city . " There were to be parks now , and baseball diamonds on the Ellipse . Promenades for the wealthy , too  --  but even this was democratization . Previously they had fled the city for their summer places at the slightest opportunity ; now they were going to stay in Washington and be ogled by the masses . Democracy was becoming safe for the rich , and vice versa . " And Washington today ? I asked Mrs. Frank what message anyone could possibly see in the monotony of modern office buildings in the city 's new northwest . " For the first time , " she replied . " this city is now what George Washington thought it would be  --  a great commercial center . The only thing he would have been appalled by is the length of time it took . " So much for the fight over the Vietnam Memorial and whether it was to be white or black , above or below ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was clear , had been small and brief ; overall , the city is probably just enjoying a breathing space before the next big one .
