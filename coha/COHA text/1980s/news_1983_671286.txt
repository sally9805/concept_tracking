Mr. Joseph is president of the National Association of Arab Americans , and the brief press session and its setting indicated both a plus and a minus concerning the efforts of American Arabs to make their views felt in the nation ' s center of power. // First , the fact that he and some associates met with the Vice President indicated the growing influence of their viewpoint . Second , the sparsity of the press turnout indicated that , as movers and shakers in Washington , groups such as Mr. Joseph ' s were still nascent. // " We have no illusions , " Mr. Joseph said later in an interview . " The Israel lobbies have about a 50-year head start on us and are extremely well-financed . They have a lobbying effort second to none . We are placed in the David position in a David-Goliath role. " // The National Association of Arab Americans is one of a growing number of groups attempting to sell the Arab viewpoint on events in the Middle East and to influence American foreign policy in that complex and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations that amount to little more than a newsletter or an occasional press release . <> <> Competition With Jewish Groups // Others , such as Mr. Joseph ' s group and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee , are larger , growing organizations that are using the techniques of the computer age to galvanize the more than two million Americans with Arabic backgrounds and trying to compete with well-structured Jewish groups devoted to Israel ' s interests. // The National Association of Arab Americans , which was founded in 1972 , has a staff of 30 and is the only group officially registered with the Federal Government to lobby in behalf of American Arabs. // " We have to develop our political clout , " said Mr. Joseph , a Pittsburgh manufacturer whose parents came from northern Lebanon . " American interests demand a change in our foreign policy . Even if we can ' t effect the change we want right now , we will no longer be silent . We ' ll be heard . If we go down , we ' ll go down kicking and shouting. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of American Arabs into the Congressional hearing rooms and the Government agencies where decisions are made was a latecomer to the Washington scene. // " People ask , ' Where have you been all these years ? ' " Mr. Joseph said . " The answer is we were busy being Americans , being assimilated . I ' m not crazy about ethnic politics but apparently they ' re needed . " <> <> Reagan Efforts Backed // Most of the American Arabs are of Lebanese extraction , Mr. Joseph said , although his organization has members whose roots are Egyptian , Palestinian , Syrian and Iraqi as well . The National Association of Arab Americans is more moderate than some of the other organizations . It supported the troop withdrawal pact signed by the Israeli and Lebanese governments last spring. // " We likened the Lebanese to parents trying to ransom a kidnapped child , " Mr. Joseph said . And the organization is supporting the efforts by the Reagan Administration to get the disparate factions in Lebanon to sit down and produce a plan that will assure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s group opposed sending American marines to Lebanon , but it changed its view and supported the Reagan policy . Commenting on the killing of more than 200 marines in Beirut on Sunday , Mr. Joseph said : " We feel the grief being felt by all Americans all over the country . But the U.S. at this point can ' t make a precipitous withdrawal. " // In response , Mr. Joseph said his organization was calling for an international embargo of all economic and military aid to any country currently occupying Lebanon or sending arms to its many militias . " As Arab-Americans , we ' re saying enough is enough , " Mr. Joseph said. // He acknowledged that the Sunday explosion could result in a setback for groups such as his because of a perception here of " Arabs killing marines . " <> <> Marines Called ' Sitting Ducks ' // " Sure that could have a bad effect , " he said . " Those young men are sitting ducks in an untenable situation. " // The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June , 1982 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided opportunities for groups of Arab Americans to gain some exposure . Some new organizations , small and focusing primarily on relief efforts for Palestinian refugees , came into being . But , said Mr. Joseph , the impact of the invasion is " diminishing with time - people forget. " // A primary goal of the groups is to curtail the American commitment of aid to Israel , something they have not achieved . They want the funds to go to Lebanon for reconstruction projects and for Palestinian projects on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. // Mr. Joseph ' s group is also backing a House resolution introduced by Representative Mary Rose Oakar , an Ohio Democrat and one of the few members of Congress with an Arab background , that would put the House on record as opposing any partition of Lebanon , a prospect that has been raised if the central government of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel is unable to assert itself and become broad-based. // The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee , one of whose organizers in 1981 was former Senator James Abourezk , a South Dakota Democrat , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereotype of Arabs in the United States . It seeks to erase such synonyms for " Arab " as " drifter , " " floater " and " vagrant " and has done battle with cartoonists who have portrayed oil-rich sheiks as leering despots with a stranglehold on the nation ' s gas pumps . <> <> Dispute Over a Textbook // Recently , John Zogby , the antidiscrimination group ' s national field representative , contended that his organization had been instrumental in having the State University of New York Press discontinue the publication of a textbook on the Middle East . There were passages in the book , " The United States and the Middle East , " by Philip L. Groisser , the group found offensive . The university says the book was discontinued for financial reasons. // The oldest of the groups is the Association of Arab- American University Graduates , which was established in 1967 after the Six Day War . According to a study by Kent Obee , the university group , which has headquarters in Belmont , Mass. , focuses primarily on the Palestinian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it has produced a large array of studies on the Palestinian problem along with papers and monographs on the overall Israeli-Arab dispute. // The university graduates association is to hold its 16th annual convention in Washington Nov. 10-13 on the subject , " The Arab World - Human Rights , Political and Economic Challenges. " // In addition , there are a growing number of seminars at universities and conferences sponsored by study groups that , while somewhat rarefied , have contributed toward an expanded airing of Arab views. // At the diplomatic level , according to one expert who did not wish to be named , the Arab governments have " become aware of the Hill " and are " just beginning to get active and alert . " Domestic American-Arab groups , the expert said , were doing " a reasonably good job " but " the problem now and forever is the Arab- American community is not the American Jewish community " and does not have its numerical strength and organizational edge. // " We don ' t have to be as big or as powerful as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to be strong enough to educate Congress. " // //
