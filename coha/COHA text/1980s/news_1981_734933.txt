txt A British law suit of extraordinary interest in this country is the recently concluded one in which the Unification Chtirch ( better known as " the Moonies " ) sued a newspaper , the Daily Mail , for libel . Not only did the Unification Church lose , but it was ordered to pay nearly S2 million in court costs , and the jury recommended that its tax-exempt status be reconsidered . The perpetually tense relationships among government , press , and religion become especially strained when a church appeals to government to punish the press . The Unification Church made a tactical error , it would appear from the outcome , when it.decided to sue the Daily Mail . Perhaps subjective confidence in their own righteousness led Unification Church leaders to underestimate the chances that a trial jury might conclude that what the Daily Mail had published Was true , if derogatory . The paper had quoted the father of a British ' ex-Moonie as describing Unification Church members as " robots , glassy-eyed and mindless , programmed as soldiers in this vast fund-raising army withno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-baked ravings of Moon , who lived in splendor while his followers lived in penury . " On the other hand , spokes-Men for the Unification Church said that they were making " every effort " to move Britain to choose the goal of " a godly society " rather than " a Marxist society " . and that they hoped to become " greater than the Church of England . " Both government and press do well to avoid defining for other people what " a godly society " is , and to accept evangelists ' having great latitude in trying to win adherents through persuasion . But also churches do well not to cry " libel " when uncomplimentary accounts of their activities are published . The freedom to proselytize and the freedom to publish are two facets of the same diamond . The . public interest is served by respecting both . Most spectators who identify with neither of the parties in the Unification Church v. the Daily Mall will be pleased that the to lost , that government declined to penalize an example of press coverage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
