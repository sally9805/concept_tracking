Most people regard a census as a minor nuisance . But in West Germany a national census scheduled to be completed on May 25 has become a cause for protest . The pro-environment Green Party , which won 8.3% of the vote in this winter 's parliamentary elections , is leading a census-boycott movement under the slogan ONLY SHEEP ARE COUNTED . <P> West Germany has not had a census in 17 years , and officials insist they need current data for deciding such matters as tax allocation and the delineation of election districts . The census poses 33 questions , on topics ranging from a person 's religious affiliation to whether he has a toilet in his home . The Greens argue that the census is an invasion of privacy and that officials will misuse the statistics . The government has struck back by bursting into the Greens ' offices and seizing anticensus brochures .
