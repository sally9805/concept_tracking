Coke 's Columbian connection <P> <P> Since he became chairman of Coca-Cola ( 1981 sales : more than $6 billion ) last March , Cuban-born Roberto Goizueta has added new life to the once staid and secretive company . He has revitalized sales and marketing efforts and erased a lead that Pepsi-Cola had opened in the crucial race for grocery store business . Last week he uncapped his most stunning announcement : the Atlanta-based bottler will spend about $820 million in cash and stock to buy Columbia Pictures ( 1981 sales : $686.6 million ) . <P> The deal will push Coke into the forefront of the entertainment industry . It will give the firm access to Columbia 's studios and its library of 3,000 films and 10,000 television programs . Five television stations and twelve radio stations that Columbia is buying are also part of the deal . <P> The takeover is attractive to Columbia , the last of Hollywood 's independent studios , because it provides access to Coke 's vast reservoir of cash . Those funds will allow the film producer to compete with bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms have already become subsidiaries of larger corporations that can provide the financing for developing movies and TV shows . <P> On Wall Street , however , investors did not generally think that Coke would go better with Columbia . The beverage firm 's stock dropped 2 points the day of the announcement and 1 ? more the following day . Coca-Cola finished the week at 31 , compared with 34 ? the week before . Said the portfolio manager of one of the largest pension funds , who was without a Coke or a smile : " I think Coca-Cola 's paying too much , and I 'm not excited about Columbia . " The offer works out to about $70 a share for the movie firm , which had been trading for about $42 a share immediately before the merger was announced . <P> Analysts also wondered what Coca-Cola , which has promised not to interfere with Columbia 's management , knows about the entertainment business . Goizueta inists that his firm has already been in that field . Says he : " We felt entertainment made a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been in the entertainment business for almost 100 years . After all , we sell a little moment of pleasure , and that 's what entertainment is . " <P> The Coke chairman also points out that he is acquiring a solid company that has been doing very well . Says he : " We 're not buying a turnaround situation . We 're buying a very successful operation . " Frank Price , a former screenwriter who has headed Columbia 's motion picture division since 1979 , is a sharp-eyed budget watcher in an era when studios spend $10 million on average per film and must earn back nearly three times that much just to break even . Columbia 's recent big moneymakers include Kramer vs . Kramer , The Blue Lagoon and Stir Crazy . Among the TV hits it distributes are Hart to Hart , Fantasy Island and Barney Miller . Says Roy Furman , a leading film industry analyst : " Under Price , Columbia has had a greater percentage of hits on less cost per picture than any other studio . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
