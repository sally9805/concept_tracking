President chun Doo Hwan ' s state Jan. 29 to Feb. 6 was the first major event of the year , as important for its symbolism as for its substance . First and foremost , the visit signified that Korean-American relations were back to normal after a long period of strain . That in turn gave reassurance of south Korea ' s security against the ever-present threat from communist North Korea. // Along with the improved domestic atmosphere shown by the reduced sentence granted to opposition leader Kim Dae Jung ( his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment ) and a relatively smooth transition from martial law to the Fifth Republic , the state visit strengthened President Chun ' s own position and thereby helped promote the image of restored political stability. // Not that Seoul ever looked abnormal , except for a few days last april when the smell of tear gas hung heavy on the air , or when full martial law was declared May 17 and armed guards took up positions at the entrances to banks and news organizations. // The city still bustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seoul to the airport in 20 minutes . Subway construction goes on space . Gleaming skyscrapers increasingly crowd out the picturesque pointed-roof courtyards and the maze of alleys in which much of the city ' s life still goes on. // At the same time , there seems to be an increase in the number of beggars and of disconsolate-looking men with sturdy wooden A-frames on their backs  --  porters looking for loads to carry , perhaps pushed out of factory jobs by the current recession . Unemployment stands at 5 percent of the working population of more than 15 million . This year , the government says , it may go down slightly , to 4. 9 percent. // Despite the Chun government ' s purge of allegedly corrupt officials and politicians and its frowning on evidence of conspicuous consumption , the affluent society is still very much in evidence in places like the Lotte hotel ' s 37th-floor restaurant. // Once Korean businessmen used such restaurants to entertain their foreign guests . They still do , but on almost any weekday the Korean clientele engulfs the occasional foreigner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plates from buffet tables groaning with delicacies from smoked salmon and raw oysters to roast beef and Chicken Oreintale. // And the restaurants down in the alleys where one can enjoy bulgogi ( grilled beef ) or seafood pancakes or any of a variety of exotic foods for a fraction of the cost of the Lotte are similarly crowded with office workers relaxing with their friends before having the crowded bus ride home. // So the economic picture is mixed . For every story of a business failure or of a ricebowl-winner forced out onto the street there is a matching story of grandiose plans for 1981 . The restoration of political stability , however , is a very important ingredient in the renewed business confidence being shown this year. // No less important , in terms of the export orders , foreign loans , and investment that South Korean needs , is the image of a government with a coherent economic plan . Here too , after a period of confusion in the summer and autumn of last year , especially over plans to reorganize heavy industry and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Chun government seems to have got its act together. // Heavy industry is being reorganized . One key element , however , the merger of three automobile companies into one , has run afoul of foreign complications and the government may pragmatically allow things to remain as they are . Hyundai , with a link to ford , will continue to be South Korea ' s main passenger car manufacturer . Saehan , a smaller company , with a 50 percent investment by General Motors , will remain independent unless General Motors and Hyundai can reach a compromise share in Hyundai as well. // The government plan for 1981 forecasts a real economic growth rate of 5. 4 percent , in contrast to the steep decline of 5. 7 percent seen in 1980. ( south Korea was the only non-communist country in the region to register a negative growth rate in 1980. ) // To achieve this , the government hopes to hold inflation to 20 percent , in contrast to the more than 30 percent registered in 1980. // To achieve this , the government hopes to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 30 percent registered in 1980. // Wages , which increased last year by 27 percent  --  less than the inflation rate  --  will be held this year to 15- to 17- percent raises . Government employees will be given only 10 percent raises  --  if the government can get away with it . Will workers faced with continuing inflation accept a second straight year of reduced real wages ? If the alternative is unemployment , they may. // The government is telling enterprises to set up labor-management councils in which the need to raise productivity before wages will be stressed . It was , after all , the continuous raising of wages in disregard of productivity after the oil shock of 1973 that diminished the competitiveness of Korean exports vis-a-vis rivals Taiwan and hong Kong. // These exports , in turn , are to be raised to $20. 5 billion , compared with $17. 5 billion in 1980 . The increase of 17 percent is modest , and according to Kim Woun Gie , former deputy prime minister and now chairman of the Korean Traders Association , the target should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with $21. 7 billion in 1980 , leaving a trade gap of $5. 5 billion . Because South Korea ' s invisibles account ( such as tourism , shipping charges , investment income , and repatriated income from workers abroad ) will be more or less in balance , the current-account deficit will also be $5. 5 billion. // To finance this deficit , a net capital inflow of $6. 1 billion will be required . In round figures , South Korea will probably have to borrow about 8According to Hah Young Ki , governor of the Korean Development Bank , South Korea now pays about $3 million a year in interest and repayment of principal on foreign loans outstanding . This means a debt-servicing ratio of 13 percent , comparing favorably with Mexico or Brazil. // In fact , foreign banks are eager to lend to South Korea , the main haggling point being the extent to which South Korea will have to pay interest above the London interbank lending rate ( libor ) . A World Bank report says that in some recent loans the rate has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the base rate in negotiating international loans by commercial banks ) . // South Korea expects its currency , the won , to float down a further 5 percent vis-a-vis the US dollar in 1981 . This compares with a 36 percent decline during 1980 . Devaluation helped South Korean exports but also spurred inflation because of the higher costs of imports ( nearly all of south Korea ' s exports depend on processing imported raw materials or semifinished goods ) . Governor Hah and other South Korean financial authorities think the won is now about where it should be , at around 665 to the dollar . Thus , a further gentle decline of 5 percent will not have the severe effect on inflation that last year ' s steep slide had. // If South Korea can hold the line on wages , then the recovery of production this year will not of itself fuel inflation , because production early in the year stood at about 68 percent of capacity . When production recovers to around 80 percent of capacity , the authorities expect enterprises to resume investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economy . The government hopes such investment to begin in the second half of the year. // Two international developments could upset this calculation . The first is the price of oil . South Korea experienced nearly a 100 percent increase in the price of oil last year over 1979 . The government is assuming that increases in 1981 will not go beyond 15 to 20 percent and that oil companies may be able to buffer part of these additional costs. // The other international development that could affect South Korea ' s recovery plans is the state of the economy in the developed nations , notably the United State and Japan , which are South Korea ' s largest suppliers and largest markets . A sustained economic recovery in the US and Japan would spur Korea ' s exports. // Finally , nearly half the decline in South korea ' s economic growth last year was caused by a disastrous harvest brought on by a cold , wet summer . A normal harvest alone would add 2 to 3 percent to South Korea ' s growth rate this year. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not going to repeat the extraordinary combination of factors that caused our economic growth rate to decline by 5. 7 percent last year , " Governor Hah says. // " These factors are : first , the social and political instability of the first half of last year . Second , the devaluation of the won by 36 percent . Third , the skyrocketing price of oil . Fourth , a harvest nearly 50 percent lower than normal. // " So , if we just have a normal year , it is not unreasonable to expect a growth rate of 5 to 6 percent. " // Chung Ju Yung , South Korea ' s leading entrepreneur , chairman of the Hyundai Group and of the Federation of Korean Industries , is even more optimistic. // " Last year things were so uncertain no one wanted to invest , " he said in a recent interview in his 14th-floor office near the state capitol and Kyungbok Palace . " This year , everyone wants the economy to grow  --  the government , the public , businessmen themselves . Even without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have social and political stability we are bound to have growth . I think that 7 or 8 percent is not at all unreasonable. " // Which of these predictions and assumptions will prove true ? // Foreign observers are cautious , seeing the problems that lie ahead both for the international economy and the Korean . But they know this nation of 38 million has shown great resiliency in the past . The level of education is high , the work force skilled and well motivated , despite what one prominent thinker calls the " revolution of rising frustrations. " // If , for whatever reason , there is renewed political instability , if inflation gets out of hand and a new wage spiral begins or is violently demanded , then all predictions of economic recovery are invalid. // But most South Koreans know that they live pretty close to the margin , as it is . They may not all be enamored of PResident Chun or of the way he acieved power , but neither can they forget that North Korean troops and tanks are poised on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontations of the past , there is still time for military and civil officials , businessmen and workers alike , to come to a solid understanding that they must work together to build the better Korean they all want . If they do , the 1980s could see a second economic miracle no less impressive than that of the booming ' 60s and nearly ' 70s. // //
