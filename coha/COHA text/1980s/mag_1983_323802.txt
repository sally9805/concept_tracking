Washington works out an arms-control agreement-with itself <P> After months of arduous negotiations , an agreement on Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ( START ) was finally reached . All the parties involved at last accepted a radical new " double build-down " plan that would reduce the total destructive capabilities of the Soviet and American strategic arsenals as well as cut the number of warheads on each side 's long-range missiles . Amid the fanfare and self-congratulations at the Rose Garden ceremony marking the agreement , it was easy to forget that the tough bargaining had taken place entirely within Washington , and that there was no sign at all that what had been worked out between the White House and Capitol Hill would be accepted by the Kremlin . <P> Indeed , the Treaty of Pennsylvania Avenue seemed to have followed Alice through the looking glass . Usually the White House sets U.S. arms-control policy and tries to get Congress to go along . This time President Reagan let a group of Congressmen take the lead in fashioning an imaginative initiative of their own . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it evolved has changed the nature of the domestic debate over nuclear arms . " We have been able to get the Administration to adopt an arms-control approach that is genuinely bipartisan and will provide a consistent , sustainable basis for the next Administration , whatever it is , Democratic or Republican , " said Congressman Les Aspin of Wisconsin , a liberal Democrat . <P> Reagan was amply rewarded for not standing on presidential prerogative . In the first place , he secured congressional backing for the MX missile . He is also able to present Moscow with a START proposal that enjoys strong bipartisan support . Said Kenneth Duberstein , the presidential assistant who helped to put the package together : " It gives a signal to the Soviets that we are united . " Not least of all , Reagan may have been able to dispel his image as an inflexible hard-liner and defuse the arms-control issue before the 1984 elections . Said one of his senior advisers : " This is what we should have been doing a year ago . " <P> The double build-down plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and the U.S.S.R. reduce from approximately 8,500 apiece to 5,000 the number of warheads they have deployed atop long-range missiles . It incorporates the novel proposal that both sides destroy more than one old weapon for each new one deployed as they modernize their forces . Reflected too is the idea that certain weapons are more threatening , or " destabilizing , " and should be discouraged . For example , large land-based missiles that carry multiple warheads have the capacity to destroy enemy missiles in a pre-emptive strike and are more susceptible to being destroyed by a first strike . Since both sides know that they may have to use such missiles first if they are to use them at all , they encourage hair-trigger reactions . In addition , the new proposal meets the Soviet desire that bombers , in which the U.S. enjoys a strategic advantage , be simultaneously placed on the negotiating table in Geneva with land-based missiles . A complex formula has been devised to measure each country 's nuclear firepower on missiles , submarines and planes ( see box ) .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
