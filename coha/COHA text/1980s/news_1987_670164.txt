PHILADELPHIA  --  Rising above the plateaus of boxy buildings that once dominated this city ' s skyline is a sleek glass tower with a tapered top . To admirers , the new building symbolizes a brighter future for a city whose image has been sullied lately by charges of corruption and mismanagement . To detractors , it insults the city ' s past by overshadowing the City Hall tower that was Philadelphia ' s tallest structure for almost a century . But everyone agrees that Willard G. Rouse III , the developer who dared to break with tradition and build the city ' s first skyscraper , has radically altered Philadelphia ' s appearance . Now , the 45-year-old Mr. Rouse is trying to uplift the city ' s psyche as well . Several times a week , in speeches to community organizations , he invites people to dream with him about how great Philadelphia could become . He also tries to practice what he preaches : His company , Rouse &; Associates , is backing a for-profit affiliate that rehabilitates old buildings and constructs new ones for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with black businessmen to create a black cultural center in the heart of a slum . Four months ago , when the city ' s highly touted tribute to the Constitution was floundering , Mr. Rouse was recruited by the mayor to try to salvage the bicentennial festivities . Now , as the unpaid chairman of the planning organization known as We the People 200 Inc . , Mr. Rouse is working 13-hour days to firm up schedules and raise cash . " I see it as one of the few events in my lifetime that can positively change a lot of attitudes in this city , " he says . " The city needs the psychological boost of doing something successful . " In some ways , Mr. Rouse typifies a new breed of real-estate developer . " In the past , developers looked only as far as their property lines , " says William Zucker , a co-director of the Real Estate Center at the University of Pennsylvania ' s Wharton School . " Today , they are recognizing that their real-estate assets will be viable only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mega-developer Trammell Crow has helped build the city ' s arts district and has donated $6 million to Southern Methodist University ' s business school . In New York , William Zeckendorf Jr. is helping to rejuvenate the Union Square neighborhood with his Zeckendorf Towers condominium and office project , which includes space for a theater group . Mr. Rouse ' s uncle , James Rouse , who made his name by creating festival market places in Boston and Baltimore , devotes most of his time now to working with neighborhood groups in 26 cities to provide housing for low-income residents . But the younger Mr. Rouse stands out . One reason is that Philadelphia ' s civic leaders have a tendency to shoot themselves in the foot . Two years ago , police dropped a bomb on a house occupied by a radical group known as Move . In the fire that ensued , 11 people died and 61 homes were destroyed . More recently , the developer chosen by the city to rebuild the houses was indicted with his partner on charges of stealing more than $200 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mr. Rouse ' s company was allegedly approached by a mobster and a city councilman seeking to extort a $1 million bribe , he went straight to the authorities . His firm ' s cooperation led to the recent convictions of Nicodemo " Little Nicky " Scarfo , the organized-crime boss in the Philadelphia area , and the councilman . Simply put , Mr. Rouse is filling a leadership vacuum . He believes that low expectations , more than anything else , limit a person ' s  --  or a city ' s  --  achievements . " I don ' t think there are a lot of people in Philadelphia who say , ' I can , I should , I will , ' " says James H. Simon Jr. , a developer and friend of Mr. Rouse ' s . " If there were , he ' d be less noticeable . " Indeed , Mr. Rouse has been in the public eye so much lately that many people believe he has political aspirations . But he says that negative news stories about the Constitution celebration have soured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin is too thin to get into politics , " he says . " I enjoy chasing my rainbows in private . " Not everyone sees a pot of gold as the city ' s reward . Dennis Clark , a historian who has written extensively about Philadelphia , says Mr. Rouse ' s efforts to address neighborhood problems have so far been " microscopic and almost marginal in the face of the collapse of urban life in this city . " In any case , Mr. Rouse has his hands full at the moment . Although the opening ceremonies of the Constitution bicentennial went smoothly in May , We the People still faces several hurdles . It is about $9 million short of its $20 million fund-raising goal . And it is still looking for sponsors for floats for a nationally televised parade in September . But Mr. Rouse and other officials are quick to point out that as much as $5 million in state financing is expected to arrive this summer and that announcements about other donations are imminent . Fund raising has been difficult because the organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infighting and made promises it couldn ' t keep . At one point , it said that the governors of the original 13 states would convene in Philadelphia in May to mark the start of the constitutional convention here 200 years ago . The organization also said that a joint session of Congress would be held here in July . But only six governors attended the opening ceremony , and the joint session has been replaced by festivities that are expected to attract less than half the 535 members of Congress . " It isn ' t going to be what it could have been  --  or should have been , " complains Richard Rovsek , who resigned recently as the group ' s fund-raiser after failing to line up a single national sponsor . But Mr. Rouse vows that the bicentennial will be " a howling success . " And , he adds gleefully , " I think I ' m going to serve crow to the press come October . " Mr. Rouse , who grew up in Baltimore and is known as Bill , clearly isn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For many years , he toiled in obscurity , building mostly speculative suburban warehouses and office buildings that lacked the pizazz of his famous uncle ' s projects . His first break came at the age of 26 , when he visited a California developer seeking a job . The developer , Guilford Glazer , invited Mr. Rouse to stay at his home . Soon , he offered Mr. Rouse the chance to develop a 600-acre industrial complex in a Philadelphia suburb . Four years later , Mr. Rouse took nearly $80 , 000 of his profits from the venture and set out on his own . With three partners , he formed Rouse &; Associates , now among the dozen or so largest diversified developers in the U.S. Even in his early days , Mr. Rouse had a knack for pulling off deals that others thought were impossible . Once , he rented two bulldozers for an hour to help woo Owens-Illinois Inc. as a tenant for a building he planned to construct on a piece of land he didn ' t yet own . When a skeptical real-estate salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owens-Illinois representatives , the bulldozers were cruising around , looking busy . Mr. Rouse spread out his plans on the hood of a car and launched into his pitch . " He was able to romance them and get them interested in the deal , " recalls Mr. Hayden , now an executive vice president of Cushman &; Wakefield Inc . In the mid-1970s , when the bottom fell out of the real-estate market , Mr. Rouse ' s firm shrank , and he contemplated bankruptcy proceedings . One of the lessons he says he learned is that lenders are harder on developers who flaunt their wealth . Today , despite his success , Mr. Rouse shuns fancy cars , boats and clothes . Although his equity interest in Rouse &; Associates is considerable , he pays himself an annual salary that is said to be only about $150 , 000 . He lives with his second wife and their four young children in a farmhouse on several acres in a rural area outside Philadelphia . He usually tools around in a beat-up station wagon , although his colleagues recently insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule . And he dresses so poorly that one of his bankers bought him a $600 silk sport coat a few months ago to replace the shapeless green plaid jacket he wore incessantly , including one time when he met President Reagan . Despite its size , Rouse &; Associates reflects Mr. Rouse ' s personal values . The company , which operates in seven states and has assets of $550 million , is highly decentralized and gives even beginners a chance to prove themselves . Mistakes are viewed as the price of educating the troops . None of the 220 employees , including the 35 partners , have titles . Mr. Rouse insists that making money isn ' t his firm ' s primary goal . " This is a company that makes deals with its gut , " says Jill Felix , a former social worker and real-estate saleswoman who joined Rouse eight years ago . " It has to feel good , it has to look good , and hopefully the numbers work . " Consequently , Rouse projects are known for their quality . The company doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-cost approach even wins accolades from Mr. Rouse ' s bankers . " It doesn ' t bother me so long as each project is well conceived and well underwritten , " says David Boucher , who until recently handled Mr. Rouse ' s loans at Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia . " As it turns out , all the projects we financed for Bill Rouse are financial successes . " Mr. Rouse and his associates can also be quite shrewd . Before they could start work on Liberty Place  --  a $600 million project that , when completed , will include Philadelphia ' s tallest building , a second office tower , a hotel and retail space  --  they had to overcome several obstacles . The first was gaining control of a chunk of prime property . Rouse had bought some of the land , but much of it had been snatched up by a competitor who also wanted to put up a building on the site . Neither developer could proceed without the other ' s land , so a high-stakes auction was held to determine how much the winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls the contest the " Shootout at the OK Corral . " No one will say how much he ended up paying , but the price was apparently more than twice the city ' s going rate at the time of $300 a square foot . " We didn ' t expect to lose at the price we were willing to pay , " says Donald W. Pulver , the president of Oliver Tyrone Pulver Corp. , which bid against Mr. Rouse . " We were very disappointed  --  and very rich . " Next came the matter of the gentlemen ' s agreement that for 90 years prevented builders from constructing anything taller than the statue of William Penn , Philadelphia ' s first urban planner , atop City Hall . When Mr. Rouse unveiled his plan , conservative Philadelphians were aghast . Others fretted that Mr. Rouse ' s 60-story building would destroy the human scale that makes Philadelphia so livable . But with promises of jobs and tax revenue , Mr. Rouse quickly won over the city council . Today , the first Liberty Place tower is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Rouse certainly enlightened a lot of developers , " says Jay Cranmer , a Linpro Co. managing partner who plans to put up two 50-story towers . Mr. Rouse , meanwhile , has moved on to other challenges . At a recent conference on low-income housing , he pitched his vision of Philadelphia as a hotbed of social experimentation . He proposed bringing together 10 experts on low-income housing , giving them a week to choose their best ideas and making a commitment to execute those ideas . Although several of the projects are sure to fail , Mr. Rouse said , " to fail is not wrong . To not take a chance is wrong . " Someone in the audience asked how such an experiment could begin . " I ' ll put up $20 , 000 , you pick the 10 people and we ' ll do it , " Mr. Rouse said . So why does he care so much about Philadelphia ?
