When Alan Greenspan became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board a year ago , no one expected him to behave like a blindly loyal servant of the Republican Party . But some skeptics feared that his long-standing ties to the G.O.P. would make him loath to hurt Republican chances during a presidential campaign by raising interest rates , even if such a move seemed necessary . <P> Last week Greenspan proved those critics dead wrong . In an effort to keep inflation at bay , the Fed raised its discount rate from 6% to 6.5% . That bellwether interest rate , which the central bank charges on loans to financial institutions , now stands at its highest level in two years . Says Robert Hormats , vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs International investment house : " The increase , announced just a week before the Republican Convention , puts to rest any doubt about Greenspan 's independence . " <P> Major banks followed the Fed 's lead . By week 's end the prime lending rate for business borrowers rose from 9.5% to 10% , a three-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market : the Dow Jones industrial average fell 73.26 points in two days after the central bank announcement and closed on Friday at 2037.52 , down 81.61 for the week . <P> The Fed Chairman and his five fellow board members boosted the discount rate because they feared that the economy might be overheated enough to speed up the pace of inflation . The Fed became particularly concerned a week and a half ago , when a new employment report was released . While it showed that the unemployment rate climbed from 5.3% to 5.4% during July , largely because of a surge in the number of teenagers entering the work force , the figures also indicated that the economy had created 283,000 jobs in the month , a sign of strong growth . One other worrisome sign appeared last week , when the Government reported that wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 5.7% in July , up from a 2.2% rise in 1987 . <P> Many economists share the Fed 's view that inflationary pressures are building . Paul Getman , director of financial services at the WEFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , predicts that within the next six months consumer prices will rise by as much as a 6% annual rate , compared with last year 's 4.4% . But others voice concern that the hike in the discount rate could damage the economy . Democratic Senator James Sasser of Tennessee is concerned that higher interest rates could strengthen the dollar and widen the trade deficit . A rising dollar tends to make U.S. exports less attractive to overseas consumers at the same time that imports become less expensive for American buyers . <P> The jump in the discount rate did give a short-term boost to the dollar . In one day , the value of the greenback jumped from 1.90 West German marks to 1.92 , its highest level in 18 months . But by week 's end foreign-exchange traders sold dollars and drove the value of the currency back down . They calculated that U.S. trading partners might intervene to prevent the U.S. currency from rising too far .
