MEXICO CITY  --  Mexico has been struck by a political earthquake . It is five days now since Mexico ' s presidential election . Vote results remain in dispute , three presidential candidates still each claim to be ahead in the balloting , and the only certainty is that neither Mexico nor Mexican-American relations will be the same again . Carlos Salinas de Gortari , the candidate of Mexico ' s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which has dominated Mexican politics for nearly 60 years , remains the most likely contestant to take office for what would be a six-year term beginning Dec. 1 . But even that remained in doubt yesterday because the government electoral commission , after stalling for days , still hadn ' t released an official vote count . The delay has sharply raised speculation that Mr. Salinas failed to win even a plurality of the popular vote in last Wednesday ' s balloting . Even if he manages to get a plurality , Mr. Salinas , unlike his PRI predecessors , who reigned over Mexico like monarchs , will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be much diminished by enlarged and emboldened opposition parties on both the left and the right , and his ability to keep his promise to continue a policy of economic liberalization will be greatly in doubt . " How do you govern when there are serious doubts about whether you won or not ? " asks Jorge Castaneda , a noted Mexican political commentator . Unofficial government vote counts show Mr. Salinas and leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas as the first- and second-place finishers , respectively , with conservative Manuel Clouthier running a strong third . While close election results are common in the U.S. and other Western democracies , they are entirely new to Mexico , where the ruling party has been accustomed to announcing election majorities of more than 70% every six years  --  amid recurrent charges of vote fraud , to be sure . Ironically , Mr. Salinas who actively campaigned for a more genuine democratic process in Mexico , has to some extent become the victim of a process that almost certainly exceeded his own expectations and desires . For the U.S. , an increasingly democratic Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As much as American bankers and diplomats have often criticized the authoritarianism of PRI-dominated Mexico , they had privately come to rely on the one-party rule . " You could always count on the PRI to keep a lid on Mexico , " says one worried American banker based in Mexico City . " Who knows what happens now ? " A clear victory for Mr. Salinas most likely would have meant continuation of President Miguel de la Madrid ' s pragmatic policies of privatizing Mexican industry , opening Mexico ' s economy to more foreign investment and global competition , and making painful interest payments on the country ' s $107 billion foreign debt , much of which is owed to American banks . As budget and planning minister in the present government , Mr. Salinas helped draft these policies . But whether he will have the courage or political capability to carry them forward is in doubt . Mr. Cardenas , who is claiming victory with 39% of the vote to what he says is Mr. Salinas ' s 33% , campaigned vehemently against government economic policies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico ' s debt payments even if it means a moratorium on payments to international banks . " The people simply can ' t sacrifice anymore , " he said over and over again to loud cheers from Mexicans who have been increasingly pinched by economic austerity . Although the charismatic Mr. Cardenas may have difficulty transforming an outpouring of popular support into an effective political machine , his policies may still triumph . The reason : One technique the PRI has traditionally used to squelch the opposition is to appropriate its agenda . Some bankers say they already saw the influence of Mr. Cardenas in the Mexican government ' s debt policy even before his election showing . During the campaign , the government increased its rhetoric on the debt , at one point calling for a halving of Mexico ' s $10 billion annual debt service . The government ' s electoral commission met late into the night yesterday amid speculation that final results mightn ' t be released until midweek . The mounting delays have only further fueled discussion of possible fraud . The government insists the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voter turnout , which was the biggest in Mexico ' s history . Some 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 64 Senate seats were also at stake in Wednesday ' s voting . The latest unofficial vote tallies released by the government this weekend show Mr. Salinas with 48. 7% of the vote , Mr. Cardenas with 27. 2% and Mr. Clouthier with 18. 9% . The PRI concedes its opponents won more seats in the Mexican congress and senate than ever before but it doesn ' t say which seats or how many . Mr. Cardenas claims to have won Mexico City , which includes one-quarter of Mexico ' s 80 million people , and most political observers believe he is correct . Many analysts say that Mr. Cardenas , who was a PRI member until last year , may still have friends in the PRI who are trying to undermine Mr. Salinas , a 40-yearold Harvard educated technocrat . Mr. Salinas , who was hand-picked for the presidency by Mr. de la Madrid , is widely resented in the PRI for his youth and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over government claims of victory , the PRI ' s reach into nearly every phase of society continues . On Saturday night , an army general appeared on the government-controlled television news to assure the public that everything was under control . Indeed , some government-supported news magazines with deadlines before last Wednesday ' s election already have run articles speaking of Mr. Salinas ' s victory in the past tense . But over the weekend , tension on the streets increased , as anticipation of the release of the election results grew . The conservative National Action Party , or PAN , which has for months been preparing a Philippine-style program of civil disobedience in the event of electoral fraud , began to put its plan into action . A throng of 70 , 000 PAN supporters led by their presidential candidate , Mr. Clouthier , marched in protest on the National Palace here Saturday night . And in the northern Mexico PAN stronghold of Chihuahua Saturday , party supporters withstood rain to shut down two bridges linking El Paso , Texas , and Ciudad Juarez , Mexico . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge takeover was part of a broad strategy to close other international bridges along the 2 , 000-mile border to protest alleged electoral fraud . Mr. Cardenas so far hasn ' t urged his supporters to take to the streets . If he ultimately does so , either independently or in cooperation with the PAN , the confusion and tension here clearly would escalate . Mr. Cardenas , however , charged at a weekend press conference that for Mr. Salinas to take office would " be the technical equivalent of a coup d ' etat , " indicating that he hasn ' t any intention of simply watching Mr. Salinas assume the presidency . Whatever his immediate intentions , Mr. Cardenas is the new and potent wild card in Mexico ' s political game . The 54-year-old politician is the son of Mexico ' s most revered modern president , Lazaro Cardenas , who nationalized the country ' s foreign-controlled oil holdings in the 1930s . He is an engineer by training and was drummed out of the PRI after starting a dissident movement , the so-called Democratic Current , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more populist economic program . His support is based on a combination of nostalgia and discontent about Mexico ' s economic crisis . Barnstorming the countryside in an unreliable Volkswagen bus , Mr. Cardenas had the sort of helter-skelter intensity that Americans have seen in Jesse Jackson ' s presidential bid . Mr. Cardenas ' s stance as an outcast from the PRI won him strong support from those who were most damaged by recent , wrenching changes in the Mexican economy : peasants , the urban poor , some union members and students . Clearly , pain for many has been great . Unemployment has doubled during President de la Madrid ' s six-year term , inflation has often reached into triple digits and the real income of most people has been halved . The government and many international economists have argued that this is a short-term price for a stronger economy , and healthier nation , in the future . It was precisely to take the nation ' s mind off its economic misery that the PRI held out the prospect of greater democracy through clean , competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed himself but he virtually handpicks his successor , as Mr. de la Madrid chose Mr. Salinas . Mr. Salinas presumably never thought that Mexicans would take his call for " modern politics " so literally . The PAN , a pro-business party , has been running candidates for years , with little effect . But it was Mr. Cardenas , leading the newly resurgent left , who brought this election alive and helped put an end to Mexico ' s anachronistic oneparty rule . At a time when the Philippines touted People Power and the Soviets glasnost , the Mexicans continued to cling stubbornly to the doctrine of the carro completo , or , the full car . This meant that the PRI loaded up all of the victories in every presidential , gubernatorial and senate race , allowing the opposition nothing . But last Wednesday , the proverbial car ran out of gas and , at this juncture , no one can accurately predict who is going to pick up the passengers.  --  - Dianna Solis in Ciudad Juarez and Alfredo Corchado in Mexico City contributed to this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
