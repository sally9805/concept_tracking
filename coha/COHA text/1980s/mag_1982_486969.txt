In the bad old days of J. Edgar Hoover , the F.B.I . did not go in for undercover investigations of corruption . Hoover cultivated the F.B.I . ' s reputation as the fearless and squeaky-clean foe of the forces of godless communism and gunslinging bank robbers . To William Webster 's credit , today 's F.B.I . devotes much of its energy to investigating political payoffs and other crimes largely ignored in the Hoover era . But , , as a just-issued A.C.L.U. report on The Lessons of Abscam makes clear , the F.B.I . has not yet learned how to do its job in a manner that comports with principles of due process of law . This is not to deny that its task is sometimes difficult . The courts have not developed case law and Congress has not enacted guidelines - that protect the innocent from becoming targets of highly intrusive undercover investigations . The report documents how easy it is for carefully conceived investigations to slip over into operations that are vulnerable to manipulation by those who have political or bureaucratic motives rather than valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how targets , of undercover investigations are chosen that is the main concern of the report . There should be evidence , the A.C.L.U. maintains , that a target is engaged in an ongoing pattern of criminal activity before an undercover investigation is launched . The report also-calls for continuing supervision of investigations to insure that safeguards are being respected , and it proposes civil damage remedies for victims of unwarranted undercover operations . We join in recommending the standards proposed by the A.C.L.U. If enacted into law , they would permit the F.B.I . to maintain its focus on political corruption and would help-assure that individual rights are protected . WHY-THEY CA N'T RULE THE RETREAT - OF THE RIGHT ALAN WOLFE As recently as four years ago , the prospects for the right in the developed world were brighter than at any time since World War H. Joining Margaret Thatcher in the Commonwealth were conservative Prime Ministers in Australia and Canada . The United States was mired in the , disillusionment with government that would bring Ronald Reagan his greatest starring role . One could not deny the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental Europe . Sweden 's Social Democrat &; had lost control of the government to conservatives for the first time in forty-four years . And in Israel , Menachern Begin had come to power , as much because of domestic unease as foreign policy designs . This will not be a conservative quarter-century ; the rout of the right has clearly begun . Norway and Denmark are experimenting with conservative coalitions , but these are notable for being unable to touch entrenched social policies rather than for enacting new programs . Australia still has Malcolm Fraser , but he is , according , to all polls , in deep political trouble . The Netherlands faces a stalemate that should result in a center-right government , but if it agrees to allow U.S. missiles on Dutch soil , it will face an uproar . Everywhere else  --  with the possible exception of an England condemned to the euphoria of winning a colonial war  --  the right has either been significantly defeated or-is beating a hasty retreat from its principles . Consider the global picture : ? Canada threw out its right-wing government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trudeau in the absence of any alternative . ( Continued on Page 399 ) Drawings by Robert Durham The Smear A alit 1 f the campaign to smear and discredit the nuclear freeze movement goes on as merrily as it has in recent days , all may be well . Sordid accusations  --  such as the President 's suggestion that antinuclear groups are controlled by the K.G.B .. : . always rebound to discredit those who make them . A recent case in point . Seldom has a respected , influential newspaper debased itself as The Washington Post did on October 6 : its editorial " Hot Words for the Freeze " alleged that two groups  --  the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom and Women Strike for Peace  --  are Soviet fronts or dupes . And seldom has such a newspaper abased itself as The Washington Post did on October 9 : its editorial " The Peace Groups " unreservedly withdrew the allegations and an apology was tendered . The paper 's ombudsman , Robert J. McCloskey , may regard this as an " extraordinary ' atonement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is really extraordinary - is that a paper of this stature should have joined in the McCarthyism in the first place . Even Jeremiah Denton , the oafish Senator who originated the , smear against the women 's groups ( with as-sists from the October Reader 's Digest and the scurrilous Information Digest ) , has backed away from his position ? somewhat . His accusation of un-Americanism against Betty Bumpers , wife of the Senator from Arkansas and head of a group called Peace Links ( which has representatives from Denton 's target groups ) , must have ultimately seemed incredible even to its promulgator . This does not mean we have seen the last of this old , old tactic . Like a jack-in-the-box , it keeps popping up every so often , a source more of amusement than alarm . But when it is not hammered firmly and quickly back into place , it ceases to look funny  --  which is why Frank Donner will be documenting the smear campaign in a forthcoming issue . We take some pleasure from the fact that the time between the bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be getting shorter . We hope , though , that readers  --  and voters  --  will observe the silence on this matter from the White House . Reagan has neither come to the support of the grotesque Red-baiters in their hour of need and humiliation with a repetition of his ugly charges nor offered any atonement , extraordinary or otherwise , for his statements . In all fairness , he should either provide some evidence to back up his cavalier charges  --  difficult though that may be  --  or he , too , should apblogize . Rhetorical Device ? ) entral America is now divided over how to avoid the region 's first major modern war . What began C as a simple , straightforward proposal has been confused by Washington rhetoric , and the result-ant delay could be dangerous for everyone . Mexico and Venezuela took a constructive and timely step last month in recommending talks between Nicaragua and Honduras to resolve the escalating conflict along their border . Panama supported the proposal . The State DepartMent , however , has said that it addresses " only one aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now become interested in a regionwide agreement . It suggested a instead a plan that would include a ban on foreign arms and advisers in the area and would , in addition , outlaw " subversion " ? e.g. , Nicaragua 's alleged aid to rebels in El Salvador and Guatemala . Central American countries supporting the U.S. initiative include its major military clients , El Salvador and Honduras , and frightened Belize and Costa Rica . The two proposals may not be inconsistent , for in fact they address separable issues . But Honduras has been using the U.S. initiative as an excuse to put off serious bilateral negotiations with Nicaragua . Last week , Honduran President Roberto Suazo announced that he would not meet with Nicaragua 's head of state unless the agenda was approved by other Central American and leading Caribbean countries . The earlier Honduran response was even more revealing . - Suazo was , said a spokesman , " too busy " to attend the proposed talks . Indeed , Honduras has been busy , as only poor countries drenched in military aid can be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half and absorb a 300 percent increase in military aid over only two years ; to upgrade one 's navy ; to cooperate with the Salvadoran Army in harassing and killing Salvadoran refugees ; and , not least of all , to welcome the stream of U.S. military officers and training teams . It 's also busy work to serve as a base for exSomocista National Guardsmen out to overthrow a neighboring government  --  the basic cause of the border tensions in the first place . That border conflict is Central America 's paramount problem , a short fuse potentially leading to a large-scale explosion . Bilateral negotiations should not be clouded by demagogy over Nicaragua 's purported involvement in other countries . If the Hondurans are " too busy " to talk seriously now , they are likely to be far busier fighting a war later on . In criticizing and bypassing the Mexico-Venezuela proposal , the Reagan Administration seems to be more interested in winning some rhetorical war of its own than in saving lives in Central America . Funding Apartheid p ure gall . Now that the International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with , South Africa is trying to obtain a $1.1 billion loan through the back door . Pretoria made a formal request for the easy-term loan earlier this month after downplaying suggestions at the Toronto meeting in September that it would need a financial bailout . At a press conference on October 5 , Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said the Reagan Administration would judge the loan strictly on its economic merits . I.M.F . sources told Jim Morrell of the Center for International Policy in Washington that they understand this to mean the United States will instruct the American director of the I.M.F . to support the loan at a meeting scheduled for November 3 . If approved , the $1.1 billion loan will be the largest ever received by South Africa from any source . And for what purposes will the country use the money ? It can not be a coincidence that the sum is equal to the increase in South Africa 's military expenditures from 1980 to 1982 . As the London International Institute for Strategic Studies reported in its most recent Strategic Survey : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors , and particularly her highly aggressive campaign in Angola , were substantial . Her defence budget rose by 30 percent , to a record level of almost $3 billion for 1981/82 . " The last time South Africa was allowed to dip into the I.M.F . kitty , in 1976 , it took $464 million to pay off the $450 million increase in its defense expenditures over the preceding few years . Given the criticism the L.M.F. received on that occasion , few observers thought South Africa would dare to make another request this year , despite evidence that a drop in world gold prices and the effects of the worldwide recession have made it difficult for Pretoria to meet its foreign debt obligations . When rumors of the South African approach to the I.M.F . circulated earlier this year , critics of the apartheid regime responded . On September 5 , twenty-two members of Congress asked Secretary . Regan to oppose any South African loan request . - The formal position of the United States and the I.M.F . has always been that loan decisions must be made on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the United States has a history of pressuring the I.M.F . ' s executive board , where it has an influence far beyond its 19 percent of the votes , to favor loans to countries it supports and to cut or deny loans to those it does n't . In July 1981 , for example , U.S. director Richard Erb persuaded the fund 's executive board to approve a $36 million compensatory financing loan to El Salvador  --  even though I.M.F . staff economists had refused to recommend its adoption and the directors representing most of the major nations of Western Europe had accordingly opposed it . Conversely , the United States has successfully opposed loans to countries it disapproves of , such as Grenada , Vietnam and Nicaragua . Clearly , a double standard is at work , which in the long run can only undermine support for the I.M.F . both here and abroad . South Africa 's latest request should be rejected ; it is designed for nothing more than financing the military defense of apartheid . - Heeere 's ! In recent weeks , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign trail , in person and on the air , with what seems to be a grim determination to use humor to deflect criticism . When the number of unemployed , for instance , reached 10.1 percent of the work force , he said , " It was 7.4 when we started . Going to 10,1 makes it 2.7 that has occurred since we 've been here . And I am willing to accept responsibility for the 2.7 if those others will accept responsibility for the 7.4 . " Very funny . As a public service we asked our resident expert to speculate as to where this trend might lead . ?

And that 's only the people who are still looking for work ! ( Laughter ) The Bureau of Labor Statistics says-'the 1.6 million people who have given up job hunting do n't count as unemployed . Why , if this recession goes on long enough , the unemployment rate will be zero . Nobody will be looking for work !

No  --  the black fellow . - REPORTER : Last week , campaigning in Texas , you took credit for the big stock market rally , as you did for the one in August . Most experts attribute the rallies to a prediction of lower interest rates and the Fed 's loosening the money supply  --  in both cases , due to the recession .

RicHARti LINGEMAN Sovieticus S o much of what we know about the Soviet Union is , - reported through a haze of cold war rhetoric and ideological stereotypes . And yet such skewed wisdom shapes our decisions as a nation on everything from the hot school lunch program ( can we afford it ? ) to the nuclear freeze ( can we not ? ) . - In an effort to get at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have asked Stephen F. Cohen , a professor of politics at Princeton University , to write a series of monthly columns for us over the next year . Cohen , a frequent visitor to the Soviet Union , is the author of several books on Soviet affairs , including Bukharin and the Bolshevik Revolution , The Soviet Union Since Stalin and the forthcoming Soviet Politics and History Reconsidered . His articles have appeared in The New York Times , The Washington Post , The New Republic and other periodicals . His first column appears on page 390. 390 The Nation . October 23 , 1982 STEPHEN F. COHEN SOVIETICUS . T he Siberian pipeline controversy in the Atlantic alliance is an international Hamlet without the Prince . The real drama , and possibly the tragedy , will be played out in Moscow . . , President Reagan 's campaign to stop the natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe could affect the , outcome of the most important debate in Soviet politics to-day : Should the Soviet Union move toward or away from the West ? . On one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that progress requires more political , economic , scientific and cultural " bridge-building " to the West . On the other are a growing number of xenophobic Russians , nurtured by the Stalinist experience and a resurgence of traditional nationalism since the 1960s , who see all Western influence as a " cesspool " of corruption and subversion and as the source of the country 's problems , from unrest in Poland to falling Slavic birth rates and nonconformist children in the U.S.S.R. Espousing a truculent Russophilism , they want to close off the opening to the West , which has been growing larger since Stalin 's death in 1953 , and return the Soviet Union to its autarkic ways behind an imperial iron curtain . This is no peripheral issue ; it is a deep-rooted and poten- , tially fateful struggle over the future of the Soviet Union . Echoing nineteenth-century quarrels between Westernizers and Slavophiles , the present debate over a Western-oriented or an iron-curtain Russia divides leaders , dissidents and ordinary citizens alike . It underlies a muted controversy inside the Politburo and . the political establishment ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pits ancient cults of Rodina , or the Motherland , against modernism . Beneath the surface , the clash is often acrimonious , as I have witnessed repeatedly . Two middle-aged officials , both Communist Party members and neither Jewish , quarreled at a private gathering . One insisted : " To save us from our own traditions , from people like you , we need more of the West . " The other replied : ' " You and our Zionist scum would sell Russia 's soul for Pepsi-Cola . " In the early 1970s , it seemed that the Western orientation would prevail ; Despite strong opposition , Khrushchev had knocked a large hole in iron-curtain Stalinism at home and opened cooperative relations with the citadel of the West , the United States . The Brezhnev government , while reversing other Khrushchev policies , pursued that opening to the fuller d  --  tente of the 1972 Nixon-Brezhnev accords . Soviet lines to the West seemed firmly laid , including trade , scientific exchanges , emigration and arms talks . But the Western orientation has suffered a cascade of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet-American trade and emigration to a ' trickle . - American grain embargoes , boycotts , technology bans and : renewed drives for military superiority displaced first-the spirit of SALT II and then the treaty itself . An arc of border crises from Afghanistan and Iran to Eastern Europe , exacerbated by the specter of a Sino-American axis , made Stalin 's fortress strategy seem safer than Brezhnev 's bridge-building . Events in the Middle East revived " world Zionism " as an anti-Semitic synonym for everything Western . Poland 's economic crisis demonstrated the " perfidy " of Western credits . Iron-curtain Russophilism has gained new force in Soviet politics as a result of these and other shattered " illusions . " It is now a clamorous opposition to the whole opening to the West and a contender for power . It is entrenched in powerful party and military organizations and in the K.G.B . and is trumpeted daily by influential newspapers and journals . The bridge-building Brezhnev leadership appears to be on the defensive . Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko expressed its lament and its vulnerability in June : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another , that were built over decades . " Reagan 's antipipeline campaign could deal Soviet Westernizers an even worse blow . The 3,500-mile gas line symbolizes everything iron-curtain Russophiles despise : a permanent opening to the WeSt , the selling of Russia 's treasures for foreign cash and financial dependence on the outside world . Above all , Reagan 's campaign undercuts the Westernizers ' essential argument that stable Soviet-American relations are possible because American anti-Sovietism is merely an electoral tactic always abandoned by latter-day Presidents , such as Nixon ; for " bilsinesslike relations . " Reagan 's willingness to jeopardize the NATO alliance and apply sanctions even against American-owned companies in order to " punish " the U.S.S.R. proves , Russophiles now can argue , that American Sovietophobia is an organic obstacle to a stable opening to the West . Completion of the pipeline over American obstructions , as is likely , will give Soviet Westernizers one- fallback position  --  an opening to the West without the United States . That position is being encouraged by Western European editorials protesting Reagan 's measures and dissenting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Brezhnev emphasized hopefully in late September , d  --  tente has " deeper roots " in Europe than in America . But given the obsessive importance of the United States in Soviet thinking and the fall of Schmidt 's pro-d  --  tente government in Bonn , that position may not offset growing anti-Western influence in determining power and policy after Brezhnev . Should we care about this internal struggle over the Soviet future ? Clearly , the American hard line on , the pipeline could foster a more lasting Western European estrangement from the United States , But there is also a worse prospect . Reagan 's crusade " to prevail " on the pipeline issue abets the political fortunes of the most xenophobic , militaristic , pogrom-minded forces in Soviet politics . A Russia isolated again from the West would be a nuclear superpower driven back upon its most despotic traditions , resentments and anxieties . Such a development would help no one . Its first victims would be what we profess to care about in foreign affairs  --  human rights , Eastern Europeans and a safe world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
