For 10 years Mr. Wright had served as House majority leader . According to tradition , that put him on deck to be the next Speaker of the House . Yet Wright - always loyal , usually fastidious in his pronouncements - had been careful not to seem smug about his career prospects and not to upstage the Speaker of the House , Thomas P. ( Tip ) O ' Neill Jr. // ' ' I don ' t want to be speaking for the Speaker , ' ' Wright would protest . ' ' As long as I ' m the majority leader , the Speaker won ' t need a food taster. ' ' // // Wright ' s circumspection was about to pay off in his election as the the 51st Speaker of the House , commencing a new congressional era . The 63-year-old Texan was off at the far end of the chamber , quietly making some final changes in his acceptance speech . A few moments later his colleagues dispensed with the customary election by secret ballot and elevated Wright to the speakership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. O ' Neill had announced his impending retirement two years ago , Wright ' s candidacy for the speakership had generated the momentum of a freight train - so much so that no one bothered to oppose him. // During 31 years as a congressman from Forth Worth , Wright quietly did the things one must do to climb the rungs of influence in the House . The effort culminated in a 1976 surprise victory over two more-senior rivals to become the majority leader. // President Reagan and the Republican Senate took their places in 1981 ; the House of Representatives became the only Democratic stronghold in the government , and Wright became ' ' Tip ' ' O ' Neill ' s man Friday while the Speaker led the opposition. // When the 100th Congress convenes in January , the Democrats will be astraddle the Capitol , retaining their huge House majority ( now 258 to 177 ) and having taken control of the Senate , 55 to 45 , in the November election . Democratic leaders have a chance to challenge the President with the sort of legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate. // House Democrats are banking on Wright ' s seizing the opportunity . Members of Congress and congressional observers say Wright is more interested in the details of legislation than was O ' Neill , whose strength lay in broad political strategy . They expect that the details of many bills coming from the House will bear Wright ' s mark to a much greater degree than they did O ' Neill ' s. // ' ' Jim Wright knows as much about the levers of this place as anyone , ' ' says House majority whip Thomas Foley ( D ) of Washington , who will succeed Wright as majority leader when Wright officially becomes Speaker. // Like O ' Neill , Wright is known as a fierce partisan , with a penchant for leaping into political confrontations with abandon . He was one of the most vocal advocates of an attempt by House Democrats to repeal the third year of the 1981 Reagan tax cut . The House passed the repealer , but not the Senate. // Wright has been a consistently vocal foe of Reagan administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He broke with most of his colleagues in the Texas delegation to seek defeat of aid to the Nicaraguan contras. // But many Republicans say they would rather deal with Wright than O ' Neill , if only because Wright has a reputation as an indefatigable worker who seems to be better versed on the issues than was O ' Neill . ' ' He is the quickest study I know , ' ' says Craig Raupe , a former Wright aide and close friend , now a Washington lobbyist. // Says House minority leader Bob Michel ( R ) of Illinois : ' ' Jim will be aggressive , but I think fair. ' ' // Wright himself says , ' ' I don ' t have in mind a grandly ambitious shopping list of things to do , but I do think we have a responsibility in Congress to come forward with our own agenda . We are not just supposed to react to the President. ' ' // He will reintroduce the comprehensive trade bill , attacked by the administration as brazenly protectionist , and revive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other matters on Wright ' s agenda : welfare reform and an overhaul of the farm subsidy program. // Perhaps the clearest sense of the independent tone Wright might set came after his election as Speaker , when he told reporters that he thought the tax cuts for higher-income taxpayers as set out in the tax-code overhaul adopted earlier this year ought to be delayed . It was a daring pronouncement , and Wright ' s colleagues in the Democratic leadership stifled looks of horror . They knew what was coming : Within 24 hours , the proposal had elicited howls from Republicans and conspicuous discomfort among Democrats , particularly in the Senate. // The episode underscores a political reality Wright will have to accept as Speaker . Rep. Dick Cheney ( R ) of Wyoming says , ' ' He ' s not going to be able to be a free agent and enunciate policy and make it stick if that ' s not where his troops want to go. ' ' // The new Speaker acknowledges that he will have to work closely with the newly empowered Democratic leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wright says that fact ' ' places upon the ( House ) leadership a different responsibility to work in tandem with the leadership of the Senate . ' ' But he calls it ' ' an opportunity more than a problem. ' ' // In fact , Wright has an excellent working relationship with the incoming Senate majority leader , Robert Byrd ( D ) of West Virginia . The two have already begun to confer on an almost-weekly basis. // Wright ' s dealings with Senator Byrd and the Senate Democrats in the center may be helped by the fact that he is considered to be of a more moderate philosophical stripe than O ' Neill , who represented one of the most liberal districts in one of the most liberal states in the country . Wright hails from a district that went for Reagan in both 1980 and ' 84 and has strong oil and gas interests. // Some observers say Wright is closer to the ideological center of the House Democratic Caucus than O ' Neill and thus may not become as prominent a national spokesman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also encounter a degree of resistance to his House leadership. // Some people find Wright ' s adrenal personality jarring , especially next to O ' Neill ' s avuncular style . ' ' Jim Wright ' s not a guy that has a lot of friends on this side of the aisle , ' ' says a Republican member of Congress . ' ' Clearly , Tip was a much-loved figure. ' ' // Late one evening at the end of the congressional session , the member recalls , when House members had nearly finished debate on the omnibus drug bill and were preparing for a vote , Wright asked the presiding officer if he could make a final , 10-minute statement on the floor . When the presiding officer asked the chamber if there were any objections , hisses and catcalls echoed through the chamber . Wright backed down. // ' ' I was fascinated that they treated him just like any member , not like the person who was going to become their Speaker , ' ' the Republican member says . ' ' Tip wouldn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t even think Bob Michel ( the GOP minority leader ) would have. ' ' // Wright ' s temper is legendary . He is reputed to be thin-skinned , and to accept criticism with difficulty . Twice , he has nearly come to blows with colleagues on the House floor. // He is known to explode at colleagues in private meetings . But he cools down as quickly as he heats up . ' ' He always assumes it is his fault , ' ' Mr. Raupe says . And so Wright usually follows his outbursts with effusive apologies. // ' ' Jim needs to watch his temper , ' ' says O ' Neill . Wright does not disagree : ' ' I think he ' s right , no doubt about it. ' ' // Some Democrats are also concerned that Wright does not project the image they want on television . It has been suggested that he is more a master of the 30-minute harangue than the 30-second sound bite . On the House floor , a Wright performance can be excessive , or stirring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch him and you know when he ' s going to get partisan , ' ' Republican leader Michel said in 1984 . ' ' The eyebrows start to rise . The voice begins to stretch out . And the Republicans say , ' Snake Oil is at it again. ' ' ' // Others have a different reaction . ' ' Jim can go to the ( House floor ) and make a speech and change a dozen votes , ' ' says O ' Neill . ' ' That ' s a talent. ' ' // Wright ' s persuasive powers will be taxed to the utmost in his new position . The Speaker has enormous power to decide what legislation reaches the floor and when . But ultimately his power , and the power of the leadership he heads , is of a collaborative nature . He must persuade and cajole committee and subcommittee chairmen to his point of view , and he must corral members of the House , who tend to be better educated and more independent-minded than their predecessors of a generation past. // Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline over House members than O ' Neill did . But ' ' it ' s a tall order , ' ' says House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman John Dingell ( D ) of Michigan . ' ' Have you ever tried to discipline 258 Democrats ?
