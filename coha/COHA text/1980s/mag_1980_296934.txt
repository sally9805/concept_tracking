With a running mate and a platform , the third man revs up <P> For Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan the campaign is only beginning , but for Independent John Anderson it has already reached a crisis stage . Over the summer , the white-thatched Congressman passed his first vital test : getting on enough state ballots to be considered a serious candidate . But that victory was bought at a heavy price . While Anderson was preoccupied with collecting signatures on petitions , his ratings in the polls dropped , the flow of money to his cause dwindled , and his image blurred as the man who faced tough issues unflinchingly . <P> Anderson must move immediately . Improving his poll percentages enough by the end of next week to be included in the debates staged by the League of Women Voters is only the most pressing challenge . Anderson has to develop themes and strategy quickly to convince voters that he offers a positive alternative , not just a name that is neither Carter nor Reagan . Says John Sears , Reagan 's former campaign manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick with you . Anderson has not done that very well . " <P> The Congressman from Illinois knows all too well the fix he is in . " We are getting into a critical phase of the campaign , " he says . He tried his best to perk up his showing by performing the tasks that party candidates accomplish at conventions : choosing a running mate and issuing a platform . His vice presidential selection , Democrat Patrick J. Lucey , former Governor of Wisconsin ( see box ) , is hardly likely to give Anderson a major boost . Lucey is a skilled campaign planner and organizer , and has close ties to labor leaders , who have been very suspicious of Ander son . Still , Lucey has neither a widely recognized name nor a national constituency . <P> The 300-page platform released by Anderson promises " an untraditional program that responds to new challenges in new ways . " Among them : a set of tax rewards for businesses and workers that obey wage-price guidelines , and tax penalties for those who break them ; exempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several months in order to boost employment . <P> For the most part , the platform illustrates Anderson 's eclectic mix of conservative and liberal positions . For conservatives , it promises only programs " small enough " to be paid for out of the normal growth in tax collections " associated with an expanding economy " and opposes large cuts in personal income taxes before the budget is balanced . For liberals , the platform advocates a ban on construction of nuclear power plants until work begins on a permanent site for the disposal of atomic wastes . It also calls for ratification of the SALT II treaty , with some " supplementary measures " to be proposed to Moscow that , Anderson hopes , would allay some Senators ' doubts that the Soviets ' observance of the treaty can be verified .
