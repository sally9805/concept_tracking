Although faced with the threat of an imminent federal takeover , a far- from-supplicant Chicago Housing Authority is demanding nearly $500 million in additional federal funding over the next three years to improve the living conditions of Chicago ' s 145 , 000 public-housing residents . The demand , one of the CHA ' s major negotiating points in talks with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) , was included in a proposal delivered Friday to HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce . A HUD spokesman said Pierce and other top-level department officials were in budget meetings and wouldn ' t have any immediate comment on the proposal . Submitting the proposal , which for the most part was a restatement of the housing authority ' s previous negotiating stance , was an attempt by the CHA board to reopen talks with HUD . Negotiations broke down on July 27 . Wayne McCoy , a private attorney hired by the housing authority for its negotiations with HUD , said the additional money is needed " to make CHA whole . " The funding demands have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to writing or mentioned publicly , McCoy said . For several months , federal housing officials have been withholding millions of dollars from the housing authority in an effort to pressure Mayor Harold Washington and the CHA board to cave in to HUD demands that the agency ' s day-to-day operations be turned over to private management selected by HUD . Washington and his representatives have agreed to hire a management team , but they want the CHA board to make the selection and to retain authority over the team . Like the HUD plan , the city proposal would set performance objectives that would provide the basis for judging the team ' s work . But McCoy said the increased federal funding is " a quid pro quo " for any performance standards . Without extra money , improvements won ' t be possible , he said . If the housing authority ' s demands were met , the CHA would receive as much as $853 million from 1987 through 1989 . The bulk of the extra money would be for renovation of aging and deteriorating buildings . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a huge increase over the $34. 5 million it could expect to receive if HUD continues its previous funding levels for such work . For this year , the CHA is seeking $50 million for emergency work such as asbestos abatement , lead-paint removal and the elimination of fire hazards ; $6. 6 million for the often-delayed rehabilitation of the Lakefront Properties ; and $52. 2 million for capital improvements caused by years of deferred maintenance . The request for each of the next two years is $100 million . In addition to the renovations , the CHA is demanding $398. 4 million in operating funds over the next three years  --  an increase of $102. 6 million over what it otherwise would expect to receive . HUD has argued that it must take control of the agency because of past mismanagement . Also Friday , CHA board members and officials signed a " Pride Agreement " and joined tenants in cleanup efforts at three public housing developments as part of CHA Pride Day . More than 50 CHA employees and residents of the Washington Park Homes swept , mopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cottage Grove Ave. before heading to Cabrini-Green . Another group did cleanup work at the Ida B. Wells homes . " We hope this cooperative effort will spread throughout the developments , " said Brenda Gaines , the CHA ' s interim executive director . Gaines signed agreements with building council leaders that spell out tenant and management responsibilities for cleaning and maintenance of buildings in the Washington Park Homes , at 4414 S. Cottage Grove Ave. ; in Ida B. Wells , at 706 E. 39th St. ; and in Cabrini-Green , at 1230 N. Burling .
