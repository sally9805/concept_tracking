" As far as I know , there has never been an animal like this set up in Government , " said L. William Seidman , who is chairman of the agency , known as the Resolution Trust Corporation , as well as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. // " We ' re really sort of the body , and they ' re the mind , " he said of the agency ' s oversight board , which consists of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady ; Jack Kemp , the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , and Alan Greenspan , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board . Two people from outside the Government will be added to the board by the President. // Since President Bush signed the legislation two-and-a-half weeks ago that created the trust corporation and authorized the $159 billion rescue of the savings industry , the oversight board has already stepped in several times to alter the plans of regulators. // In one instance , the overseers delayed the sale of five multibillion-dollar savings institutions until a review can be conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Administration is ultimately accountable to Congress for spending $50 billion of taxpayer and savings industry money , the overseers warned , they intend to intervene whenever they think they should. // The trust corporation faces numerous challenges . It will have to find buyers for vast tracts of arid land in Arizona . It will have to decide whether scores of half-built apartment buildings in Texas should be demolished or sold , and determine the fair market value for windmill farms , racetracks , yachts , private planes and tens of thou-sands of abandoned single-family homes. // What is more , in the next five weeks , the corporation will have to spend $20 billion of Treasury money to close down small institutions and pay off about $15 billion in high-yield deposits throughout the savings and loan industry. // That deadline was set in the recently enacted legislation , which requires the corporation to spend $20 billion by Sept. 30 , the end of the current fiscal year. // Given that the trust corporation has spent only about $1 billion so far , it is supposed to spend at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has the responsibility for managing the trust corporation , and for the first time its officials will have to report to a higher authority . <> <> ' Ways to Work Together ' // " We ' ve got to find ways to work together , " said John Robson , Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and acting president of the trust corporation ' s oversight board. // Banking experts warn that the very nature of the new agency makes it prone to in-fighting and disputes over bureaucratic authority . For years , the F.D.I.C. has been subject to a minimum of political influence , largely because its chairman , once appointed by the President , could not be easily removed. // That independence helped it carry out its mandate as a bank regulator and manager of the banking system ' s deposit insurance . The F.D.I.C. officials assigned to manage the resolution trust are instinctively ready to fight fiercely to keep the executive branch from stepping on their toes . <> <> Accountable for Problems // But the bailout legislation also holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the agency , by having the President appoint the oversight board. // Both the Bush Administration and the F.D.I.C. are concerned about which will be blamed if something goes wrong , banking experts say . Moreover , they warn that it will not be an easy adjustment for the F.D.I.C. to understand the savings and loan industry , which differs from commercial banking in a number of ways , from its loan portfolios dominated by real estate to its relationships with regulators. // Given the task facing the Resolution Trust Corporation , the potential for problems is enormous. // The agency will essentially become the mortuary for insolvent savings institutions . It is expected to take over 400 to 500 sick institutions , as they are called , with assets approaching $300 billion. // As Mr. Seidman has repeatedly said , the resolution agency will take charge of more assets than the F.D.I.C. has handled in its 55-year history. // The strains between officials of the new agency and its oversight board have been made public several times since the legislation , which provides for expenditures of $159 billion over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five Deals Stopped // At a news briefing on Tuesday , Mr. Seidman and David C. Cooke , the agency ' s chief executive , said the oversight board had stopped them from proceeding with the sale of five multibillion-dollar savings associations three weeks ago. // They said the board had told them to delay any complex deals in which the Government might plan to hold a stake or issue guarantees , until the oversight board could review the situation. // Mr. Seidman and Mr. Cooke added that while they agreed with the orders , the delay was costing the taxpayers money. // The public discussion of the issue infuriated Treasury officials , who were unhappy with the way the F.D.I.C. described the five transactions. // " The fact was that they were ready to put the five institutions up for bids , " said one official who asked not to be identified . " Final sale would have been weeks away . They were nowhere near completing any of those deals . " <> <> Moments of Tension // Officials on both sides admit there have been other tense moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first week when it proposed to liquidate three institutions and requested financing to complete the transactions . F.D.I.C. officials say the oversight board refused to release money until highly complex documentation was presented . They complained that Treasury officials who report to Mr. Brady were was trying to micromanage the F.D.I.C. // But Treasury officials said the F.D.I.C. had requested more money than was actually needed and had been using five-month-old data. // " The oversight board is ultimately accountable , so we have to have assurance that the numbers are right , " an official said . " We felt really exposed. " // Taking on the management of the trust corporation is a herculean task for the F.D.I.C. , which until recently was a quiet , highly efficient agency that had developed acknowledged expertise in shutting down commercial banks , both big and small . <> <> Two Basic Functions // As trust corporation ' s manager , the F.D.I.C. will have two basic functions . First , it will find buyers for hundreds of troubled institutions or liquidate them , if no buyer can be found . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps as much as $150 billion worth . These tasks will require a high degree of management expertise. // The F.D.I.C. has already transferred at least 600 employees to the trust corporation , and 250 more have come from the defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board , which formerly regulated the savings industry . The new agency plans to call on private real estate experts to handle the bulk of the sales of bad assets and will also hire hundreds of its own liquidation specialists. // The concern about which agency would be blamed if anything went wrong is particularly difficult because the Federal Home Loan Bank Board came under a blistering attack last year . Members of Congress criticized transactions it had approved for the sale of giant institutions to financiers like the chairman of Revlon , Ronald O. Perelman , and the Texas-based financier Robert M. Bass . <> <> Seen as Sweetheart Deals // Both the trust corporation and the oversight board want to be sure none of the new transactions are perceived as sweetheart deals benefiting takeover specialists or other entrepreneurs . They are also concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled real estate , investors might find ways to gain windfall profits at the taxpayers ' expense. // While the White House determines who sits on the oversight board , the F.D.I.C. is likely to get much of the blame , since it will be making the decisions on transactions. // " This may be the case of getting what you ask for being the worst curse , " said Karen Shaw , who heads the Institute for Strategy Development , a financial consulting concern. // " Having pushed as hard as it did for a management role , it was unable to get an independent role , " she said of the F.D.I.C. " So it has ended up accountable but not responsible . Everybody will end up blaming the F.D.I.C. " // Moreover , many experts say the F.D.I.C. could be swamped by the added responsibilities it received in the law . Not only will the F.D.I.C. continue to deal with bank failures , which are expected to reach almost 200 this year , it also has been given new authority to manage the insurance for savings and loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> The Structure of the Resolution Trust Corporation and its Oversight Board . <> <> Resolution Trust Corporation <> <> Principal Manager : Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation <> Chairman : L.
