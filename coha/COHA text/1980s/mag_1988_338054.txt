The menu at Alejandra Mirano 's restaurant on the dusty main street of Pantasma is as sparse as the surroundings . Brown beans , rice and corn tortillas are the staples , served sometimes with eggs from the hens that cluck about the bare concrete floor . The ancient refrigerator no longer works , so the syrupy sodas are served at room temperature , an oppressive 90 degrees F at midday in April , as the town awaits the onset of the annual rains . <P> If the food and ambience at Mirano 's restaurant are spartan , they mirror life in Pantasma , a garrison and farming town in Nicaragua 's Jinotega province that has been as close to the center of the brutal six-year war as any other town in the country . Pantasma 's 4,000 inhabitants should be happy : after signing a 60-day cease-fire last month , Sandinista and contra leaders met in Managua last week to negotiate details of the final accord . The talks bogged down on both technical and substantive issues , but the two sides predicted that progress would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pantasma seems more weighed down by its bloody past than it is buoyed by any belief that the battles may finally be over . " The people have no confidence in either the government or the contras . They have been oppressed by both , " says Padre Victor Mendoza , the town 's Roman Catholic priest . " They hope , but they do n't really dare to believe in an end to the war . " <P> ! " This is a town of widows , " says Mirano , 31 , a mother of five who lost her husband three years ago . Marlene Jarquin , 28 , nods in agreement ; she regularly visits the little cemetery by the river where her husband and 36 others , all victims of a contra attack in 1983 , are interred in a mass grave . " Life is hard for us , " Jarquin says . " It is difficult to believe in peace until it happens . " <P> Such skepticism is understandable in Pantasma . The golden patchwork of maize and tobacco fields that spreads outward across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wavy line of thick rain forest . It is ideal guerrilla cover , and the contras have used it to put Pantasma under a siege that has lifted only as the truce has taken hold , and then just partly . A dusk-to-dawn curfew continues , and government troops still patrol the winding mountain roads leading into Pantasma . <P> While peace means different things to different people , no one in Pantasma seems to feel that the conflict should continue until victory is claimed by either side . " We want peace because we want to be free , " says Omar Cruz , a farmer . " In a war , no one is free . " <P> The truth of that observation is apparent to Noel Rodriguez Sanchez , 19 , a conscript in the Sandinista army who has spent nearly two years based in and around Pantasma . During that time , he says , he has been involved in more than 50 skirmishes or battles with the contras and seen more than a dozen friends die . " In Managua they do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is tough and it is dirty , and people get killed every day . " As Rodriguez sits in the shade of a store 's veranda , his AK-47 gripped between his knees , he is counting the days until his demobilization . " Just a few more now , " he grins , " and then I 'll be going home . I do n't want ever to fight again . "
