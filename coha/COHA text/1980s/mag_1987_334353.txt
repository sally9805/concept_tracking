The videotape image showed a weary-looking American hostage with a stubbly growth of beard . " This is the last message , " wrote Captive Alann Steen the next day . " Once again we announce that we will be executed at midnight . " Steen issued his stark pronouncement in an open letter last week that was signed as well by fellow U.S. Hostages Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner . Terrorists were threatening to kill the Americans and Indian National Mithileshwar Singh , also a Beirut University College professor , unless Israel released 400 imprisoned Arabs by the following midnight . But as the deadline expired , the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine , which holds the four captives , said it would spare their lives " until further notice . " <P> % The last-minute reprieve was amplified at week 's end by another statement from the captors that omitted any new threat of execution . It was one of the few hopeful signs amid what appeared to be a hopeless stalemate in efforts to free any of the 24 foreign hostages in Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel were negotiating through third parties with Shi'ite Muslim terrorists over the release of some or all of the kidnap victims in exchange for the 400 prisoners . As the guessing game continued , pessimism grew about an agreement anytime soon . With rumors shifting almost by the hour , Washington kept the Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean . The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and six other warships were ordered to leave the port of Haifa in Israel after a six-day call , and resumed sea patrol . Meanwhile , anxiety deepened further over the fate of Anglican Envoy Terry Waite , who vanished last month while seeking freedom for the American captives . <P> At times bloodshed seemed to be war-torn Lebanon 's only certainty . A powerful car bomb killed 15 people and injured 80 in a suburb of Muslim West Beirut as the week began . The moderate Shi'ite Amal militia blamed the blast on the Palestine Liberation Organization , which was driven out of Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion , and is now trying to make a comeback . Battles raged throughout the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relentless Amal blockade of Palestinian camps forced thousands of starving residents to adopt extreme measures to feed themselves ( see box ) . In southern Lebanon , Israeli warplanes struck Palestinian guerrilla bases outside the port of Sidon . <P> The week 's most riveting drama focused on the four Beirut University College teachers who were kidnaped in January . As the week began , Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut a six-minute videotape of Steen reading a statement from the captives . Then , hours before the execution deadline , the terrorists released a handwritten text of another letter that ended with moving messages . Steen , a journalism instructor , wrote to his wife , " I do n't want to see you cry anymore . Tell them to release the 400 . I love you . " Wrote Accounting Lecturer Polhill : " Foura , I love you . Sorry I 've messed up so much . " Referring to himself in the third person , he added , " Life was the only thing he ever finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV for mercy for their husbands .
