Learning hard lessons and devising new approaches <P> The Democrats knew they were going to lose . They had time to steel themselves , to discount the loss and change the subject to 1988 . Nevertheless , when the digital displays started flicking on Tuesday evening and the vote totals appeared , the thud of defeat was at last palpable . The party has now lost four of the past five presidential elections . It is being deserted by the nation 's middle class and , perhaps even worse , by the young . One Democratic strategist , a key figure in the past four presidential campaigns , seemed almost excited by his own gloominess . " This party is in the worst shape of my lifetime ! The worst since the Civil War ! If the old forces hold on , " he said of the Democratic Establishment , " this party is not going to hold together . " <P> Are the Democrats really done for ? They certainly have some fundamental kinks to work out . Their party is confused philosophically . What was long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American pluralism for almost half a century , is now widely seen as a creaky conglomeration of self-interested constituency groups , alternately dithering and carping . The wholesale rejection of Walter Mondale , who tried to stitch the New Deal coalition together yet again , demonstrated both the weakness of that strategy and the dire nature of the party 's condition . Bullied by interest blocs , the Democrats showed themselves without clear leadership and devoid of a solid ideological or geographical base . <P> But the defeat of Mondale is hardly the same as the demise of the Democratic Party . A solid majority of House members are still Democrats , as are two-thirds of the Governors and three-quarters of all other elected officials . Moreover , 43% of Americans are registered Democrats , including 5 million who enrolled just this year ; only 30% are Republicans . " This kind of handwringing about the party is familiar and knee jerk , " says Mondale Campaign Chairman James Johnson , refusing to see any general portents in Tuesday 's terrible results . " It was a victory of personality far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party elder , is not fretting either . He recalls that four years after the Democratic rout of 1964 , the Republicans took the White House , and that four years after the Republican rout of 1972 , the Democrats took it back . " I 've been in and around presidential campaigns for 40 years , " says Clifford . " And every time there 's been a landslide , people say the party that lost is through . Well , it does n't happen that way , and it wo n't this time . " <P>
