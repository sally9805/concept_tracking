txt Two weeks ago , Alfred Taubman bought a Picasso crayon drawing at the New York auction house of Sotheby Parke Bernet PLC , the well-known London dealer . " It 's embarrassing what I paid for it . " he said Last week , Mr. Taubman , a 58 year-old Michigan-based real estate developer and regular Sotheby customer , announced his in. tention to bid on what could turn out to be an even more expensive treasure : Sotheby itself . It is n't known how much he is pre ? pared to pay for it , but he said he will al least match the about $100 million bid laid on the table last month by General Felt Industries Inc. , a Saddle Brook , N.J. , maker of rug padding and office furniture owned by Marshall S. Cogan and Stephen Swid . Sotheby , which lost the equivalent of $4.6 million before taxes in the year ended last Aug. 31 but retains considerable pride , says it likes Mr. Taubman a lot better than it likes Messrs . Cogan and Swid . It welcomes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executive Graham Lewellyn said at a news conference in London . " When you 're talking about a company that is so very much involved with people , chemistry plays an extremely important part . That chemistry simply did n't exist in the case of the previous bid , " he said , referring to the General Felt offer . " It exists very strongly in this particular case . " Six-Month Review The auction wo n't begin until Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission completes a review of General Felt 's bid for the auction house , and that could take as long as six months . It could turn down that bid , or allow both to proceed . In the meantime , General Felt vows to hang on to the 29.8% of the company it had accumulated before the review blocked further purchases . And Mr. Taubman said he will add gradually to his current stake of slightly more than 5% in the auction house . The identity of the white knight raises some questions about Sotheby 's reasons for resisting the first offer . Many observers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauvinism , or perhaps snobbery . Some on Sotheby 's Bond Street staff protested its suitors ' lack of background In the art world , although both of General Felt 's owners are collectors of 20th-century art and Mr. Cogan Is chairman of the American Council on the Arts . Sotheby found General Felt 's balance sheet " overleveraged , " and has noted that Mr. Cogan was subjected to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disciplinary action ten years ago . Trade Secretary Lord Cockfield , in directing the bid to the Monopolies Commission , raised the question whether a takeover was In the public Interest , suggesting that he felt the 239-year-old auction house ought to remain British Mr. Taubman , of course , is American . He is a collector , a trustee of New York 's Whitney Museum of American Art and a member of the Detroit Institute of Arts , but his main business , developing shopping centers , is far from the art trade . No Changes Planned Sotheby 's approval of Mr. Taubman may have more to do with his plans , or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't envision any major changes at all , " he said at a news conference in London . Although Mr. Cogan says he wo n't encroach on day-to-day affairs , he and Mr. Swid are known for aggressively turning around sluggish companies . The premier position of Sotheby , which expects a small profit this year despite a first-half loss , is " under threat , " they have said . Said one Sotheby executive of Mr. Taubman : " He is n't saying  --  as Mr. Cogan and Mr. Swid are  --  that he wants to get right alongside management and make all kinds of changes . " Mr. Taubman wo n't have to borrow money to make his offer , said Marcus Agius of I . a7ard Bros . &; Co. , which introduced Mr. Taubman to Sotheby . In the past , the developer has teamed up with Henry Ford 2nd , the former head of Ford Motors Co. ; Max Fisher , the retired chairman of United Brands Inc. , and David Murdock , a Los Angeles investor who already owns 6% of Sotheby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Taubman in a later interview . " I 'm sure they would be people with whom I 've done business before . It certainly could be Mr. Ford 's or Mr. Fisher 's kind of deal . " Neither could be reached for comment , and a Sotheby official emphasized late Friday that " there 's no arrangement now of any sort . "
