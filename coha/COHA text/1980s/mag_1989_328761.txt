When Christopher Whittle unveiled his plans to bring TV to the nation 's classrooms earlier this year , he served up the deal with the classic pitch : everybody would win . Underfunded schools would get tens of thousands of dollars ' worth of video equipment free , students would get a news program to teach them that Chernobyl is not Cher 's full name , advertisers would get a captive teenage audience , and Whittle would make a healthy profit . Despite loud criticism that the daily newscasts amounted to cynical commercialization of the classroom , Whittle announced last week that he was not only going ahead with Channel One but also expanding his service . <P> Along with the original newscasts , the reconstituted Whittle Communications Educational Network plans to offer two broad categories of new programming . &lt; Classroom Channel will feature educational material chosen by an independent advisory board , which will also determine whether the channel will accept advertising . Educators ' Channel will offer instructional services for teachers and school administrators . But the ambitious scheme will still be funded by four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new plan no longer requires a school to offer the program in every classroom . <P> Whittle touts the new network as a watershed in American education . The company promises to provide 1,000 hours of free satellite time and $500,000 annually to make instructional programs accessible to participating schools . The Whittle network could even accommodate Channel One 's recently announced cable competitors : CNN 's Newsroom , a 15-minute daily newscast , and Discovery Channel 's Assignment : Discovery , an hour of instructional programming . <P> While the company , which is half owned by the Time Inc . Magazine Co. , is confident the new plan will win approval from the 8,000 schools needed to make its $200 million investment pay off , Whittle still has not redressed his critics ' biggest grievance . Says Peggy Charren , president of Action for Children 's Television : " The whole thing is still being paid for by selling kids to advertisers . The Trojan horse now has a golden harness . " <P> The question of advertising in schools has already raised legal challenges in several states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're paying kids to watch commercials , that violates our state law , " insists California Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig , who has pledged to cut funds to schools that accept Channel One . Whittle is adamant that advertising is the only feasible way to foot the bill . Says he : " Schools have a choice : either do without , or do it this way . " <P> This spring 's five-week tests of Channel One in six schools around the country were generally well received . " We saw positive changes in our students , " reports principal Stanley Jasinskas of Eisenhower Middle School in Kansas City , Kans . " They became much more knowledgeable , and they took positions on issues . " Elaine Green , assistant principal of Mumford High School in Detroit , says , " The teachers , the students , the parents were all pleased with the quality and content of the show . " With educational leaders and school personnel apparently divided on the merits of the program , the battle over Channel One may have just begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
