With illegal immigration rising , Congress belatedly tries to act <P> By twilight , about 300 illegal immigrants had massed on " the soccer field , " a patch of rock-strewn brown earth halfway up Otay Mesa and just across the U.S. border from a rundown section of Tijuana , Mexico . Some bought tacos from a vendor who wheeled a white cart through the crowd ; others burned old tires to cook makeshift meals before pushing off into the rattlesnake-infested canyons leading toward San Ysidro , Calif. , and points north . Two dozen agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) , deployed in Dodge Ram trucks on surrounding hillsides , squinted through binoculars to count the aliens and prepare to intercept them . <P> As the light faded , groups of pollos ( chickens , a slang term for the immigrants , who tend to travel in flocks ) filed into the canyons and the chase began . A border patrolman looking through an infrared nightscope at a hillside spotted four human shapes and summoned a helicopter hovering over a nearby ravine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . Another agent was about to leap out of his truck and arrest three illegals in Moody 's Canyon when his radio crackled out news of bigger game : a dozen immigrants heading toward the fields abutting Otay Mesa Road . The patrolman gunned his Ram along rutted dirt paths , dodging boulders placed by pollos to slow him down . When he reached Otay Mesa Road , however , his quarry too had disappeared , presumably picked up by smugglers driving cars or trucks toward El None . <P> The illegal visitors had one more major obstacle to pass : an INS checkpoint on Interstate 5 , where agents kept a sharp watch for vehicles heavily weighted toward the rear or bouncing oddly . Those are clues that pollos may be hiding in the trunks of cars or under the floorboards of false-bottom pickup trucks . On this particular Sunday night , agents working the 3 p.m. - to- 11 p.m. shift rounded up 155 aliens and took them to a detention center . INS guards then put the pollos aboard buses , drove them to a border crossing and herded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all would try to slip across the border again , many only hours later the same night . They would keep coming until they eventually escaped to pursue the irresistible lure of jobs that are unavailable in Mexico . Says Alan Eliason , chief of border patrols in that section of California : " We are overwhelmed . Congress has to come to grips with the problem . " <P> Belatedly , Congress is trying . After long hesitation , the House last week began debate on a bill , already passed twice by the Senate , that is supposed at least to slow the torrent of illegal immigrants across the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border . A floor vote on the Simpson-Mazzoli bill ( named for its coauthors , Republican Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Democratic Congressman Romano Mazzoli of Kentucky ) is expected this week . President Reagan put in a plug for passage at his news conference Thursday night . Said he , with a touch of hyperbole : " We have lost control of our own borders , and no nation can do that and survive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
