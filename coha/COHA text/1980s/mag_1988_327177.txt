Peering out at the assembled Palestinians in the domed auditorium of the Club des Pins convention center , Yasser Arafat donned a pair of spectacles and began reading softly from the document he held in his hands . Then the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman 's voice suddenly rose in a crescendo and his right arm chopped the air . " In the name of God , and in the name of the Palestinian Arab people , " Arafat shouted into the microphone , " the Palestine National Council announces the establishment of the state of Palestine , with holy Jerusalem as its capital . " <P> For all the fanfare at last week 's gathering of the P.L.O . ' s parliament on the outskirts of Algiers , Arafat 's new state came into existence in name only , a largely symbolic response by P.L.O . leaders who wanted to show some political results for the eleven-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . Only hours earlier , Arafat had overcome the protests of Palestinian hard-liners and persuaded the council to reverse its long-standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - implicitly recognize Israel 's right to exist . Needing a legal foundation for setting up a Palestinian state , Arafat cited the U.N . Partition Plan of 1947 , previously denounced by the P.L.O . as illegal , which recognizes the right to statehood of both Jews and Arabs . <P> Arafat 's supporters hailed the moves as a historic compromise with their enemy . Certainly the actions represented a victory for Palestinian moderates . Starting with Algeria , more than 30 countries , including Turkey , Yugoslavia and numerous Arab and nonaligned nations , quickly recognized the self-declared state ; as many as 130 are expected to do so . The Soviet Union recognized Arafat 's proclamation but did not immediately extend full diplomatic relations . In the occupied territories , the Israeli army clamped on curfews to prevent violent outbursts or jubilant displays . Though shopkeepers in Arab East Jerusalem passed out chocolates and local residents exchanged greetings of " Mabrouk " ( congratulations ) , some West Bankers disparaged Arafat 's half step toward Israel . The fundamentalist-led Islamic Resistance Movement distributed a leaflet that declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick move by some of the Palestinian ranks to steal the fruits of the intifadeh 's victory . " <P> Israeli officials quickly dismissed Arafat 's actions as irrelevant gimmickry designed largely to improve the P.L.O . ' s image abroad . Arafat 's message , in fact , was aimed not so much at Israel as at the U.S. , which the Palestinian leader feels is the only country that can pressure Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza . Said Arafat : " The ball is now in the American court . "
