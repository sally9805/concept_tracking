The best description of Bellman and True is an oxymoron : it is , of all things , a dour caper . That is , a usually merry cinematic enterprise  --  the one in which a group of swagmen laugh all the way to the supposedly impenetrable bank vault from which they intend to extract millions  --  is shown with brutal realism . <P> Such a stroke of honesty is alone enough to commend this good little British picture . But it is almost the least of its virtues . The mobsters force an alcoholic computer engineer named Hiller ( played with a wonderfully watery passivity by Bernard Hill ) to act as their " bellman , " or alarm-system neutralizer . His only virtue is his devotion to his stepson ( Kieran O'Brien ) , who has no name but the one we impute to him : True . He is a wise , sober child , spunky and devoted to the man who takes responsibility for him when both are deserted by the child 's mother . <P> Hiller concocts elaborate electronic toys to amuse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from his loss . Their unsentimental relationship is developed with a clarity that makes a shining contrast with the instinctive violence of their criminal associates and the devilish complexity of the heist . Hiller 's contributions to the proceedings are as witty as the toys he builds for True , and the denouement of the whole tale is gratifying . But it is constant , often startling , shifts in the film 's emotional tone , the economy of its writing and its lively movement through the - bleak London landscape that lend it true distinction .  --  R.S.
