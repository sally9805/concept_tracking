It was fight night again at Madison Square Garden last night , and the bloodlust of the mob of almost 17,000 lifted the two battlers to the sunburst ceiling as they charged into the final round . As midnight neared it became primal and animalistic , the customers screeching and the antagonists grunting and straining as they flailed at each other again and again . They had done it many times , from London to Tokyo , but it was closer now than ever before , and they were swinging as though each thrust might be the last , looking for the Sunday punch , and the Thursday kill , crunching away like a couple of guys trying to make a pebble pathway out of a block of granite . Somehow , although it wasn ' t a title bout , it seemed to mean more because one of them - the Swede - had become the American ' s master , and the feisty kidfrom Illinois was doing everything to bend those metal bars that held him and spring from bondage . But Jimmy Connors couldn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit . The last round was a tie-breaker , and the fighters were engaged not in boxing but the supposedly genteel game of tennis . There isn ' t anything genteel about the way they go at each other , though . It is always an alley fight in clean white pants , and the Swede finally knocked out his adversary of seven years , 3-6 , 6-3 , 7- 6 ( 7-4 ) in a rowser that would have set a Quaker meeting to screaming . Although this was only the second day of the 1979 Masters , the season- closing convocation of the leading eight finishers in the Grand Prix campaign , what Borg and Connors did to each other and for the roaring devotees was worthy of their past Wimbledon and US Open finals . Tennis as played by these two against each other is combined slugfest and marathon . They ran and banged for 2 1/2 hours , never letting up , booming away at each other , punching and counterpunching until it seemed their legs and arms would disintegrate . Borg seemed to be traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , but New York City as well . He ' d never beaten Jimmy here in three shots , and the salty Connors , goading himself on with curses , is New York ' s baby . " I got scared he was going to catch me . I came close to winning several times , " said Borg , " and Jimmy kept coming back . I ' m playing the best tennis of my life , and I thought when he almost went ahead at the end : It ' s not gon na happen to me again in New York , is it ? " It didn ' t . Although Connors , assailing Borg again and again in the concluding tie-breaker , volleying astoundingly in banzai rushes , cancelled two match points , the Swede , at last , recorded his seventh successive win over the rival and increased his edge to 11-8 . Aside from the greatness of their firefight , the result left Connors ( 1-1 ) in plenty of trouble in the tournament , needing a victory today over Roscoe Tanner ( 1-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2-0 ) sits atop the Red Group with 2-0 in round-robin play , having qualified for the semis regardless of what happens against Jose Higueras today . John McEnroe ( 2-0 ) , the 1978 Master , was a volleying genius in humbling Guillermo Vilas ( 1-1 ) 6-2 , 6-3 despite the Argentine ' s fine effort and is into the Blue Group semis . Vilas can make it by beating Harold Solomon ( 0-2 ) who fell 6-1 , 7-6 to Vitas Gerulaitis ( 1-1 ) . Tanner won , 7-5 , 6-4 , over Higueras ( 0-2 ) . The Borg-Connors showdown was mostly toe-to-toe from the baseline , just seeing who could outsock the other . Their two-fisted backhands generated more power than windmills in breathtaking rallies when shots zinged so fast they seemed impossible to return . Yet they kept coming back with more steam , and the witnesses steamed along with them , yelling encouragement , crying out in admiration , elation and despair . Although Borg broke on top , 5-2 , in the third set , Connors rebounded to 5-5 and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective lead of 6-5 . " I was really scared then , " Borg said . " A little tight , hitting short , and Jimmy likes that . If I lose my serve , then he beats me . " But Borg refused to buckle , and he ended the game with an ace . " Man , I was ready , " Connors said . " If I make a couple of shots . . . well . . . " And there wasn ' t much more than that between them , a shot here or there . " I thought I ' m OK at 5-2 , " Borg said , " but Jimmy is so tough . " So tough that he leaped a sideline fence in making an unbelievable forehand passing shot to overtake Borg at 5-5 . " I had to start the tie-breaker good , " said Borg . Nothing better than an ace , and quickly he was up , 3-0 , as he took both of Connors ' serving points . Jimmy then lashed back by taking both of his to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8 of 11 points in overtime went against serve . Then it was 6-2 for Borg . Facing four match points , Connors guarded the net like his wallet , saving two with splendid volleys . On the third he was wide with a forehand , and Borg grinned broadly . " I had something to prove here in New York . I did it . " They had always been cool to each other , but this time , like good pugs , Bjorn and Jimmy hugged , and were enveloped in the appreciative clamor of the mob .
