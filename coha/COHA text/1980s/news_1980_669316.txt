Frank E. Morris , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , says , " Yes , I think so . " Mr. Morris , a member of the Fed ' s 12-member Federal Open Market Committee , which makes monetary policy , adds : " We all feel we are in a situation where we simply have to stick to our targets , simply because the long-run consequences of failing to deal with the inflation rate in this go-round would by 1985 be socially destructive. " // If the Federal Reserve were to move to an unrestrained monetary policy in an effort to get unemployment down as soon as possible , he noted , the rate of inflation would exceed 20 percent by 1985. // After each recent recession , the government ' s effort to speed the recovery has resulted in inflation moving a notch higher than during the previous expansion and unemployment bottoming at a worse level than during the previous recovery , he added. // " However , " he cautioned , " it will be a lot easier for us at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The Federal Reserve System , he said during an interview that was unusually candid for a central banker , has sometimes been described as a fourth branch of government after the presidency , the Congress , and the Supreme Court . " But that is not true , " he said . " The Federal Reserve has a certain amount of independence designed into it by Congress . But we don ' t have the independence of a separate branch of government . Therefore , we can not follow a position for a long time that is contrary to the view of the majority of the people. " // If the Fed tried this , he added , Congress by a simple majority could alter the laws governing the central bank to make it more compliant to congressional desires for an easier monetary policy. // Mr. Morris said : " We can drag our feet and do an unpopular thing for some time . But there is no quick fix to inflation . It will take us at least five years to get it down to a level that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five years is a long time. " // In the meantime , he predicted , the nation will experience a recession that could be close in severity to that of 1974-75 . There will be " a lot of slack " in the economy in both 1980 and 1981 , he said . Unemployment could hit 9 percent in the first half of 1981 before gradually moving down to around 7 percent . But inflation , which already shows signs of moderating , could drop to a 7 percent annual rate by the end of 1981. // " If we want to continue to reduce the inflation rate , we have got to follow a slow-growth policy and maintain enough slack in the system that it is difficult for producers to pass on cost increases , including wage hikes , " he said. // By 1985 , he went on , the United States should have established the economic conditions for a healthy economy . During the last half of the 1980s , the nation could once more enjoy faster real growth and rising living standards without excessive inflation. // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous for , and that is patience . We have a national propensity for quick solutions . If we are making some sacrifices , we want quick results . It will be difficult for us to show the kind of patience required for this sort of monetary program. // " If the American people aren ' t willing to show this patience , then the Federal Reserve will have to give in to the wishes of Congress , reflecting public opinion. " // Mr. Morris sees one hope for speeding the transformation to a noninflationary economic environment . If the administration , Congress , and the Federal Reserve demonstrate they are really serious about controlling inflation and staying with a restrained economic program , it will change public expectations for inflation . Businessmen will not be so quick to boost prices . Labor will not demand such high wages . Long-term interest rates will quickly decline . Then the inflation rate will drop faster. // The Fed ' s strategy has been termed " monetary gradualism . " The plan is to reduce the rate of growth of the money supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate has been established . Some academics have advocated that the Fed announce in detail its monetary targets for these years. // Mr. Morris commented : " I am hesitant to set forward the exact course of money growth over the next five years . We don ' t know enough about the exact relationship between the money supply and the course of the economy . Moreover , a lot could happen in five years . I ' m not convinced that is a sensible thing to do. " // Nonetheless , he does maintain that " a big majority " of the Federal Open Market Committee is committed to monetary gradualism. // The cost of such an anti-inflationary strategy is high , he admits . But the cost of a " quick fix " severe monetary contraction would be even higher . " It would require such a sizable depression that no one would contemplate that as a sensible course of action . Gradualism is the only responsible course . It has a connotation of ineffectiveness . But I don ' t think that is true. " // One difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Morris explained that the Fed is now following a monetary policy of controlling the growth of money rather than interest rates . So , once the economy starts expanding again next year , the new demand for credit will not be accommodated by a more rapid expansion of the money supply. // " What that means , " he said , " is that interest rates will start moving up at a time when the unemployment rate is probably still over 8 percent . That is precisely the point when the Federal Reserve will need some political support if we are going to be able to hang in there. " // Mr. Morris said he believes the American people have become concerned enough about inflation to accept some economic sacrifices to battle it . But it remains an open question as to whether the public and Congress have the patience to slog it out over several years. // //
