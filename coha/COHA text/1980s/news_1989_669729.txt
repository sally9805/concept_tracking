Chipping ice off the windshield with our Boston-bought scraper , I was glad we had come here . Santa Fe had reaffirmed my sense of the West both as a physical presence and as a state of mind. // // So had the drive west across Kansas and south across the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles into New Mexico . After a year living in the East , I had longed for that reaffirmation of the West. // At the Acoma Reservation , we turned off the Interstate . Leaving behind the signs and the semis , those manifestations of the Business Culture that is replacing the West ( or at least what I conceive of its being ) , we drove down off the plateau and across a small valley to Acoma Pueblo . It sits atop a 70-acre mesa about 300 feet above the valley floor . Locals claim this mesa as site of the longest continual habitation in the United States . People are said to have lived on it continually since AD 600. // A Roman Catholic cathedral , built in 1629 , dominates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtyards at various times each year . Its altar includes four tree-trunks carved in the shape of candles , each one carried the many miles from Mount Taylor - so says our guide , an Acoma woman - by young men who never let the wood touch the ground . The guide tells us this with evident pride . Her pride rests perhaps not so much in the undefiled condition of the wood as in the ritual cooperation required to accomplish its transportation to the mesa. // She also tells us that no Acoma man has ever become a Catholic priest . However , she believes that several women of the Lagunas , a neighboring pueblo tribe , may have become nuns. // Not far from the cathedral stand five kivas , unusual in that they are square ( whereas most kivas are round ) and also in that they must be entered first by climbing ladders up to their rims and then down into them . The rock of the mesa does not permit the building of traditional underground kivas . Here Acoma men worship and perform rituals as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral , I am struck by the fact that for 350 years Acomas have accommodated themselves to two different systems of belief , systems based on contradictory perceptions of reality . And I am also struck that - here on the mesa , anyway - a coherent Acoma tribal life endures despite the very different belief system of the Business Culture that manifests itself out on the highway . Clearly the Acomas have learned to live with contradiction. // We like the freedom from highways built to transport travelers so quickly across terrain that they need not look at it . We drive across the Navajo and Zuni reservations . There are no trucks here , no billboards , no telephone poles or electricity cables. // There is only space : vistas , enormous skies across which today phalanxes of clouds march in the aftermath of the storm . There are distant horizons , mesquite , gullies , canyons , and pink , ocher , and bluff mesas stretching away forever . An occasional man , an occasional town . That is all. // This is the West. // There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all this space ; it ' s easy to overlook him . There is room to move here . The landscape is the only stimulation one needs . The sky is enormous , but if your dream is a landmark on the horizon , you feel certain you can walk to it . Here the traditional Indian beliefs make sense . Man is a part of nature . His role is not to dominate nature , but to live in harmony with it. // A long day later we left the West behind . We leave the highway at Indio , a town on the western edge of the Mojave Desert , where we stop to buy dates to send to friends in the East. // The orange groves of my youth - I grew up in California - have all been replaced by houses . There seemed a certain logic to that , perhaps because I accepted the premises of the era in which the replacements occurred. // Now the date palms of this desert are being uprooted . The groves are being converted into houses . We drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These once-dusty crossroads are now suburbs for the rich . Here the neighborhoods are fenced off and guarded . Large , pastel houses cluster at the edges of golf club fairways . Their lawns stretch expansively , shimmer brilliantly green . Although there is drought in other parts of California , sprinklers ply back and forth across the late afternoon , spraying across these lawns a commodity more precious than the coins that built these suburbs. // Here man is everything . He dominates nature . There is no sky , no horizon , no sense of nature . No West . I find it impossible to accept the premises of these conversions. // Here man ' s mind and body need constant stimulation . Of course , the Business Culture provides this , even makes profits out of it . There is little natural beauty , but here are arts : painting ( by numbers , if necessary ) , movies , TV , VCRs . There is dance or its Business Culture offshoots : jazzercise and aerobics. // There are no communal purification rituals akin to carrying tree trunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . But purification rituals do exist here : tanning , dieting , therapy sessions. // Here natural process provides stimulation . Health obsessions provide diversion . Procreation becomes recreation . Ceremonial dances give way to ceremonial tennis. // I jot these notes the following evening . We are staying with friends . I am alone . The other people in the house are watching TV . In a week my son arrives for a vacation from boarding school. // I love my wife . I love my son . I want them to be happy . I want them to have a good life . I want them to ' ' have it all. ' ' // I write quickly now to say that I hunger for the West . I long to be a mere dot in the freedom of space . I yearn for enormous skies , a multitude of mesas , for horizons I can walk to. // I write because I know the Business Culture will reabsorb me - and quickly . I do not want this to happen . But like the Acomas I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
