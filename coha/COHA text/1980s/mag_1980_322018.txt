Changing winds cause deluges , droughts and misplaced snows <P> Even the Old Farmer 's Almanac could not have foreseen it all . Barely a trace of snow in New England , yet mounds of it down in Dixie . Norfolk , Va. , accumulated twice as much snow as Burlington , Vt , or Portland , Me. , and about one-third more than Chicago . Florida too was taking its licks . In early March , temperatures plummeted below freezing , putting a squeeze on the citrus crop , and tornadoes cut across the southeast part of the state . Up North folks were trying to decide whether to pack away mufflers and mittens after spring-in-December readings of 16 C ( 60 F ) . The most startling weather occurred in California , where downpours of almost biblical proportions caused floods , mud slides and untold havoc . <P> This crazy-quilt winter weather was the result of erratic changes in the usual pattern of westerly winds-especially the high-altitude jet stream-that whip across the U.S. Part of a broader global feature known as the circumpolar vortex , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northern Hemisphere , like the bottom of a whirling crinoline skirt . Sweeping northeast over the Pacific , the winds pick up warmth and moisture . Heading down again from the cold north , they cause heavy rain and snowstorms from the Rockies through the heartland to New England . <P> Last December scientists at the National Weather Service noticed an unanticipated change in air flows . It was as if the skirt had stopped undulating : the curves in the prevailing winds flattened , and fewer chill breezes were blowing down from the north . High-level winds above the 40th parallel ( near Philadelphia ) were running at extra high speeds , while those to the south slackened . In effect , explains Donald Gilman , the service 's chief long-range forecaster , the cold arctic air was blocked , almost as if it were being held back by a great fence , letting warmer , southern air dominate the weather . For the Northeast as well as other parts of the Northern Hemisphere , Gilman 's fence meant a December of mild temperatures and little snowfall . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper-level westerlies south of the 35th parallel ( from Southern California to North Carolina ) had picked up speed while those north of it had slowed . The jet stream had edged to the south , along a path that was much less curved . Instead of sweeping north over the Pacific with a cargo of warm , moist air and dumping snow and rain on Alaska , Washington and Oregon , the westerlies now were aiming their punch directly at California . The result : Southern California was inundated for nine days by storms that brought a total of 32.39 cm ( 12.75 in. ) of rain .
