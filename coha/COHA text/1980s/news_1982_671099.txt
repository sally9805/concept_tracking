The Columbia rose from the launching pad on time for the first time , a few microseconds before 11 A.M. , New York time , bound for a planned week of circling the Earth . It is the spaceship ' s fourth and final test mission. // Thunderclaps from the rockets reverberated through the humid air , the ground trembled and eventually the spaceship disappeared in its own vapor trail . The astronauts , Capt . Thomas K. Mattingly 2d of the Navy and Henry W. Hartsfield Jr. , were on their way to a 185-milehigh orbit , the highest thus far attained by the shuttle. // // Smoothest Launching Yet // The countdown preparations had been remarkably smooth . Alfred D. O ' Hara , the launching director at the Kennedy Space Center , recalling the malfunctions and delays that plagued earlier shuttle countdowns , said , " It ' s amazing how far we ' ve come along. " // Official liftoff time was 10 : 59 : 59 : 864 A.M. - 136 milliseconds early . As the astronauts climbed into orbit and settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm signals , abnormal instrument readings and other signs of trouble , real or suspected , that had characterized the first hours of the Columbia ' s first three outings . There was a minor leak in one maneuvering jet and a high temperature reading from a fuel cell , but these caused little concern at Mission Control in Houston . <> <> Rockets Sink in Atlantic // The launching ' s success was not total , however . The two solid-fuel rockets that helped boost the Columbia toward orbit were reported to have sunk in 3 , 100 feet of water off the Florida coast . They were designed to be retrieved after they spent their fuel in the first two minutes of ascent , then refurbished and re-flown . This is one of the several features that make the space shuttles generally re-usable. // Officials of the Kennedy Space Center said that both rockets apparently sank about 160 miles downrange , in the Atlantic Ocean . The two rockets had separated from the Columbia as planned and dropped by parachute to the water . Aircraft and recovery ships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the submerged rockets , which are 149 feet long and 12 feet in diameter . There was no immediate explanation of what went wrong. // Each rocket costs $25 million , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reported , and it costs more than $7 million to refurbish one for reflight . All the rockets used so far have been new , though re-used parachutes were installed in the ones for this flight. // Previously , the recovery ships had had no trouble finding and hauling in the spent rockets . The astronauts appeared to be healthy , showing no evidence so far of the motion sickness that bothered the third shuttle crew and eager to get to work . After the doors to the cargo bay were opened in an early test , Captain Mattingly reported , " We ' ve got the doors open , and we ' re setting up shop. " // Later , when the crew were assured they could stay in orbit , Captain Mattingly told Mission Control , " All right , sir , in that case we ' ll get out of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In the ascent , the astronauts dress in the rather bulky pressure suits , but for most of their time in orbit they will be wearing jump suits . <> <> Mission Shortened by 15 Minutes // As planned , it took four firings of the Columbia ' s two orbital maneuvering system rockets to boost the spaceship to its working orbit of 185 miles , five miles lower than desired . The shuttle had used more fuel than expected in its early ascent firings . Flight controllers said that the only effect would be to shorten the mission ' s duration by about 15 minutes. // The craft is circling the earth once every 90 minutes on a course that crosses the equator at angles of 28. 5 degrees , a more nearly equatorial orbit than usually flown by manned space vehicles. // Because this reduces the time the Columbia will be in range of tracking , communications with the astronauts will be less frequent than on previous missions . The course was chosen because most of the communications satellites that the shuttles are to deliver to space need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps also because the Columbia will in this way avoid passing over the Soviet Union , an evasion that may have been arranged on account of the shuttle ' s military payload . <> <> Secret Military Cargo // Bolted into the cargo bay of the Columbia this time is a package of Defense Department experiments , classified secret and known as D.O.D. 82-1 . The experiments are generally believed to include infrared and ultraviolet horizon sensors for possible future use in satellites designed to warn of enemy missile and satellite activity. // The astronauts activated the military payload this afternoon . They are under instructions not to discuss this part of their work in communications with Mission Control or to transmit any television pictures showing the cargo bay. // But once an astronaut was heard establishing a communications link with an Air Force data processing center at Sunnyvale , Calif . This center handles information from Air Force surveillance satellites . Discussions of the secret payload were presumably conducted through cryptic messages heard from the astronauts and through the teleprinter on board the shuttle. // Another assignment for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canister in the cargo bay that contains the first of the shuttle program ' s " getaway specials . " These are small , self-contained payloads that individuals , businesses or school groups can send on the shuttles on a space-available basis. // On Monday , the astronauts plan to activate and operate the rest of the payloads , including the first commercial experiment flown on the shuttle . This is an apparatus developed by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in conjunction with Johnson and Johnson , to process ultra-pure biological products in the microgravity environment of space. // Another experiment planned for Monday involves observations by motion picture cameras of thunderstorms and lightning in the skies below . Scientists want to study thunderstorms from above in an effort to understand their dynamics over a period of time. <> <>  --   --  <> <> Soviet Tests in Orbit // MOSCOW , June 27 ( Reuters ) - A Soviet-French space team was in good health today at the start of their second day of scientific experiments aboard the Salyut 7 space station , according to Tass , the Soviet press agency. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronaut , Col.
