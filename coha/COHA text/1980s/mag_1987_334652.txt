The American press can hardly be blamed for the Iran-contra scandal , since it deserves so little credit for unearthing it . It found the Iran story in a Beirut paper , while it had all but ignored Lieut . Colonel Oliver North 's gallivanting around gathering arms and money for the contras . Yet after the big story broke , the press fell out of public favor , even if not as steeply as did Ronald Reagan . Dan Rather , for example , was rated high for believability by 40% of those questioned in June 1985 and by only 28% in a January Gallup poll . <P> Many have accused the press of devoting too much space to the story . Some have blamed bias , others the press 's itch to sensationalize . In fact , because the story has thus far lacked Watergate 's drama and turned on the accumulation of details , newspaper stories ran at such length that they came to be of interest primarily to scandal junkies . But the press was not so much overplaying the story as playing catch-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to make the story big and clear again . <P> Looking back , some in the Washington press corps acknowledge that they had slacked off in frustration from pursuing stories of the Administration 's bumbling and misdeeds . The public seemed either to ignore the stories or find them carping . Not only was the President immensely popular , he had made the country feel good about itself again . His aides had succeeded as no Administration had before in managing and staging the news so that Reagan would be seen in the most favorable light where it counted most , on nightly television . In a forthcoming book , Behind the Front Page , David S. Broder of the Washington Post describes how CBS Correspondent Lesley Stahl once put together a tough , critical piece illustrating White House hype , full of flags , balloons and children . She expected to be chided for it ; instead , a White House aide said he loved it and asked , " Have n't you figured it out yet ? The public does n't pay any attention to what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed her report with the sound off and found that it looked like an unpaid political commercial . <P> In some of the comment and columns out of Washington there is now a patronizing note of **44;8948;TOOLONG . James Reston of the New York Times , dean of Washington columnists , has accused the American public of taking the Fifth Amendment , blaming everybody but themselves : " How could it have happened ? What did the American people know and when did they know it ? They knew everything from the start and did nothing about it . They like him because they 're like him : well-meaning , optimistic , credulous , stubborn and a little bit dumb . " <P> Elected politicians know better than to blame the customers . In fact , Reagan 's precipitate fall in popularity suggests that people had all along known many of the weaknesses in a President they nonetheless liked . It is hard to decide which is more remarkable in their attitude : that they think Reagan is lazy and uninformed and tells lies or that they still approve of and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions suggests a willingness to be as optimistic as he is.
