When his hopeless and long-forgotten 1976 campaign for the presidency ended  --  and even his last-ditch , favorite-hopes were thoroughly dashed in his home state by Jimmy Carter  --  Lloyd Bentsen had still not passed the asterisk level in national name recognition . Twelve years later , at 67 , the senior Senator from Texas remains largely unknown outside his home state and Washington . His career has played out in the boardrooms of Houston and the hideaway offices of the Capitol . The backslapping style of a Lyndon Johnson or a John Connally , two of his early supporters , is totally foreign to this patrician son of a wealthy landowner in the Rio Grande Valley . With his well-cut suits , nails that look manicured even when they are not , and silver hair he never lets down , he is Texas without the swagger , the kind of gentleman that stuffy men 's clubs were made for . <P> Bentsen is the oldest vice-presidential nominee since Harry Truman picked Senator Alben Barkley , then 71 , in 1948 . He lives the life of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not give up his Mercedes even when he was shepherding sensitive trade legislation through - Congress ( although he now drives a Lincoln ) . His wife of 45 years , Beryl Ann , better known as B.A. , is a former model for Vogue and Mademoiselle who gave up her career to marry Bentsen in 1943 . Of the rolling-bandage school of Senate wives , B.A. last year served as first vice chairman of the group 's organization , supervising its lunch for Nancy Reagan , and headed up a March of Dimes fund raiser . <P> The couple spend weekends at their farm outside Middleburg in Virginia 's Shenandoah Valley and play power doubles at the annual Senate tournament at John Gardner 's tennis ranch when they can get away , although Bentsen prefers singles . With the same understated courtesy he employs in the Senate , when a ball goes close to the line , he inquires with a small smile , " And how do you call the Senator 's ball ? " <P> Years ago Bentsen was known as an awesome poker player . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Congress when he won a house from a fellow Representative . <P> Bentsen 's father Lloyd Sr. was well on his way to his first million by the time Lloyd Jr . was born in a small cottage on a dirt road in Mission , Texas . " Big Lloyd " arrived in Texas from South Dakota with $1.50 in his pocket and became one of the largest landowners in the Rio Grande Valley . He started his empire with a grocery and a land-clearing operation . He hired Mexican laborers to clear the land , and instead of paying them half the contract price , as was the custom , he paid them the full amount  --  but in scrip good only in the grocery store . Soon he was buying the land he was clearing ; the small cottage gave way to a sprawling ranch house with a 27-acre man-made lake stocked with ducks and geese . At 94 , Lloyd Sr. is still running the ranching and farming business , with more than 50,000 acres , valued at around $50 million . <P> Lloyd Jr . graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 and enlisted in the Army .
