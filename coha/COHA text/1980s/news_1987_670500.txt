For example , most taxpayers wait until just before the filing deadline to contribute to an Individual Retirement Account as a way to earn an extra $2 , 000 deduction , even though the tax year had ended. // But a great many people who now have I.R.A. ' s will no longer be eligible to claim an I.R.A. deduction under the new law . For the 1987 tax year , I.R.A. deductions will be limited or eliminated entirely for taxpayers covered by a retirement plan at work and whose adjusted gross income exceeds $25 , 000 , or $40 , 000 on a joint return. // // The 401(k) Alternative // Such individuals need to move quickly if they want to wind up with the same tax benefit next year from an alternative source , such as a 401(k) employee retirement plan. // While 401(k) ' s offer tax benefits that can even exceed fully deductible I.R.A. ' s , people can not wait until the last minute to decide , as they can now with I.R.A. ' s. // Contributions to a 401(k) for 1987 can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by deducting a fixed percentage from a paycheck each week starting when the worker enters the plan . Many companies do not allow late arrivals to play catch-up . In other cases , the law puts strict limits on catching up. // Thus , employees who wait too long may discover they can contribute only a fraction of what they wanted. // " You can ' t just write a check to the company to cover the rest , " said Andrew Zuckerman , a senior tax manager at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen &; Company . " So the time to decide whether to contribute to a 401(k) is now rather than later. " // Under the new law , employees can earmark up to 20 percent of their salary to a 401(k) , up to a maximum $7 , 000 a year . But many companies allow employees to designate only a smaller percentage , such as 5 or 10 percent , thus requiring a longer period for employees to contribute the maximum allowed . <> <> Deferring Income // Taxpayers also need to take action quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it will be taxed at lower rates . For instance , someone with funds invested in a money market account earns interest now that will be taxed at rates of up to 38. 5 percent . But if the investor were to put the funds in a Treasury bill that does not mature until 1988 , the interest that technically accrues henceforth will be taxed at rates no higher than 33 percent . That is because interest on a Treasury bill and certain types of bank certificates of deposit is not deemed paid - nor are taxes due - until the maturity date. // Similarly , taxpayers considering withdrawing money from a retirement plan may want to wait until next year , when it will be taxed at lower rates. // Indeed , many of the tax-saving strategies that millions employed last year to take maximum advantage of deductions before they were curtailed or to enjoy the new law ' s lower rates are still valid - even though last year was commonly hailed as the " last-chance opportunity . " <> <> ' Same Climate ' // " In many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sidney Kess , national director of tax policy at the accounting firm of KMG Main Hurdman . The reason is that the new law is still phasing in ; tax rates are going to be reduced even further next year and deductions will continue to be cut. // For example , there is still an advantage to settling tax disputes with the I.R.S. this year or paying off outstanding credit card balances while such interest is 65 percent deductible . In 1988 interest on consumer loans and tax deficiencies will be only 40 percent deductible. // Giving money to charity this year will also be a more rewarding gesture than next year , when the charitable deduction will be worth less because of the lower tax rates . For example , giving $5 , 000 to charity this year means saving as much as $1 , 925 . In 1988 , when the top rate is reduced to 33 percent , the same contribution will provide no more than $1 , 650 in tax savings . <> <> Capital Gains // Throughout this year , investors need to keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet passed into extinction. // The length of time a stock or other asset is held before it is sold is still critical for upper-income taxpayers . Assets held longer than six months will still get preferential treatment . They will be taxed at a rate no higher than 28 percent , which is an important break for those in the upper brackets who will pay taxes at the rate of 35 percent or 38. 5 percent on short-term gains and other income. // Not until 1988 will the distinction between long-term and short-term gains be eliminated for all taxpayers. // Taxpayers who donate stocks , art work or other appreciated property to charity also need to keep the capital gains holding period in mind - even after this year . How long the asset was held before it was donated will continue to dictate the size of the charitable deduction. // The property has to be held more than six months for a taxpayer to claim a deduction for the fair-market value . Otherwise the deduction is limited to the original cost of the property . The difference can be huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deductions // Preparing for next year is not totally divorced from the 1986 filing . For instance , after sending in their 1986 returns , most taxpayers will probably stuff their tax records into a box , to which they will not return unless they are audited . But this year , taxpayers should set aside records of expenses they could not fully deduct on their 1986 return but which can be deducted in future years. // For example , people who refinanced their homes last year are not allowed to fully deduct the points they paid to the lender . Rather , these up-front fees have to be written off over the life of the loan . Thus , the record for this expense should be set aside as a reminder of a deduction for next year ' s return. // The same applies to multiyear subscriptions to business and investment publications , as well as other business and investment expenses . The Internal Revenue Service ruled last year that only a portion of these expenses can be deducted on 1986 returns . The excess will have to be claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people will find that filling out their 1986 returns may also help a bit in completing an agonizing chore mandated by the new tax law - filling out a new W-4 wage withholding form . Every employee is required to complete one so that the amount of tax withheld from paychecks can be adjusted to reflect the changes in the new law . Because of a loud outcry over the complexity of the new W-4 form , the I.R.S. has been trying to devise a simpler W-4 package , which is scheduled to be shown on Monday. // For those needing help in coping with all the changes in the new law , as well as in completing their 1986 returns , there is plenty to be found. // Taxpayers who use professional help will often fare best if they arrange an appointment sooner rather than later. // " Accountants are already busy , but they get busier as the filing deadline draws near , " said Albert Ellentuck , national tax partner at the accounting firm of Laventhol &; Horwath . " You ' re really getting less attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need for Homework // Taxpayers will also benefit if they do some homework before seeing their tax preparer , including figuring out deductions they might be eligible for . Some tax professionals are more thorough than others . But it is rare that an accountant will be able to ask enough questions to uncover every possible deductible expense the client may have incurred. // The I.R.S. has a phone service for questions on 1986 returns and basic questions on the new tax law . But as the filing deadline approaches , the phone service can at times be deluged. // " We suggest that people call toward the midweek period and in the morning , or later in the afternoon , " Roderick Young , an I.R.S. spokesman , said. // To order tax forms , the I.R.S. has set up a separate phone service . The phone numbers are listed in the back of tax return booklets. // Taxpayers aged 60 and over can take advantage of free tax counseling through the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program sponsored by the American Association of Retired Persons . Another free counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program . The service is staffed by volunteers from community groups . Local I.R.S. offices will supply locations and phone numbers for these services. //
