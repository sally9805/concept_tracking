The great gelding Kelso dies <P> A walnut horse so homely and cantankerous that he was gelded as a yearling heard the sweet cheers of a racetrack crowd for the first time in 17 years , and then he died of colic the next day at the age of 26 . Kelso , the great-grandson of Man o ' War , was fetched to Belmont in New York State the Saturday before last along with Forego , a younger pensioner similarly handicapped . The occasion was the Jockey Club Gold Cup , a stake that Kelso won five years in a row ( 1960-64 ) , when he was the horse of the year every year . <P> They led the post parade to promote a retirement fund for elderly Thoroughbreds , but they pranced like colts . <P> The particular pet of Allaire du Pont , Kelso was kept in luxury at her Woodstock Farm in Chesapeake City , Md . <P> <P> Not many geldings see a pastoral ending , but the ones that earn $1,977,896 do . <P> That stood as the record for 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry 's $3,906,297 would compare . Kelso won 39 of 63 races . After retirement at nine , Kelso kept busy , occasionally accompanying Du Pont on hunts . For a bachelor , he had a full life .
