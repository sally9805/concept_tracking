Facing 40,000 roaring youths at a Caracas stadium last week , Pope John Paul II asked , " Will Venezuela 's youth have the valor to be true Christians ? " The crowd shouted , " Si . " " And will they have the valor to construct a more just society ? " Again a thundering " Si . " " More fraternal and more peaceful ? " Once more a booming affirmation . <P> The incident typified the rousing reception accorded the Pope during the first phase of his twelve-day Latin American tour . The exchange , however , underscored a more important matter : John Paul was not just a barnstorming superstar generating good cheer , but a taskmaster issuing challenge upon challenge . When chants broke out in the stadium proclaiming the Pope to be Venezuela 's friend , he ad-libbed , " Yes , I am your friend . Yes , I am a demanding friend .

The Pope told them to oppose both the " unacceptable injustice " of their situation and the use of violence to bring social change . <P> At week 's end John Paul landed in Peru , the birthplace of liberation theology . Speaking in Lima , he attacked radicals who seek to undercut the Catholic hierarchy , and urged priests and nuns to forsake " passing ideologies . " After four days in Peru , John Paul was scheduled to touch down in Port-of-Spain , the capital of Trinidad and Tobago , before flying to Rome this week .                   @ @
