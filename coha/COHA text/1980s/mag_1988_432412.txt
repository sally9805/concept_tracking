And on the edge of the small bed sat a pale young man , his blond head bowed but his body rigid in defiance . " It would have been easier for me , " said the father , his voice trembling , " to have been told my son was dead . Rather than this . " I felt like an intruder in that intimate and agonizing scene . Half an hour earlier the young man , a white postgraduate student in my department , had telephoned to ask me to come to his digs . He had just informed his parents that he was in love with a girl classified as Coloured ( that is , of mixed blood ) . " What will become of us ? " asked the old man in horror .

The episode illustrates a point made by Willem de Klerk , sometime editor of the leading Afrikaans newspaper Rapport , before he was forced to resign because of his criticism , however mild , of the government : " The Afrikaner is bursting out of his definitions of himself as well as those of others . " There were no problems with these definitions in my childhood . As a boy I lived in a succession of small villages in the arid interior , where English was an almost unspeakable foreign language , where the only black people one encountered were servants or laborers , where God was a daily reality and visions of apocalypse pervaded one 's dreams . Some of my earliest memories ? images that persist as archetypes in the collective Afrikaner mind ? derive from a feeling of snugness and security , staring out at the world from a brightly colored wrap that held me tightly to the motherly back of a black nanny whom I knew as Aia , or squatting on the back porch eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handfuls from a black iron pot and molding it in my small fist before tucking it away . I remember visiting my maternal grandmother in Bedford in eastern Cape Province and the solemn family excursion every Sunday afternoon to the churchyard where , beside my grandfather 's tombstone , my  |p560  grandmother 's own grave had already been dug . Other summer holidays were spent in the Boland , the " upper country , " of western Cape Province with its Mediterranean climate , often on the fruit farm of my Oom ( Uncle ) Jannie at Tulbagh . He was one of the country 's expert vintners ( having studied in France , something almost unheard of in his time ) until my pious Aunt Dolly , persuaded of the sinfulness of drinking , instructed him to uproot every single vine on the property . I remember farms where all the boys , black and white , would roam the veld together and make clay oxen , or cavort in the dam , or tend the sheep , or milk the cows , without thinking about black or white . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 and the farmers ' sons began to go to boarding school in town , did the white boys settle into their roles as masters and the black ones become their servants .

If indeed there used to be a stereotype of the Afrikaner , it is no longer applicable . The angry young poet Antjie Krog , 35 , who lives in Kroonstad , the Orange Free State version of any midwestern town in the United States , 1988 The Afrikaners  |p563  says : " Sometimes I envy our parents . They knew exactly what it meant to be an Afrikaner . My generation no longer does . " THE NAME Afrikaner was used as early as 1707 during the struggle of Dutch and French Huguenot colonists against the nepotism of Cape Governor Willem Adriaen van der Stel and his get-rich-quick officials , when the unruly young Hendrik Bibault resisted arrest : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an Afrikaner , and even if the landdrost magistrate beats me to death or puts me in jail , I shall not be silent . " At that time the name simply referred to someone born on African soil , in contrast to officials of the Dutch East India Company who , from 1652 , were sent from Europe to run the small victualing station at the Cape . For almost two centuries afterward Afrikaner designated mainly persons of mixed blood . The Afrikaans language was partly shaped by slaves and others who could not speak proper Dutch . Even today the term remains loaded . Many whites insist that it embraces Afrikaans speakers from the white race only ( some would go so far as to exclude even fellow whites who do not belong to the Dutch Reformed Church and the National Party ) . Some Coloured speakers of the language ( many of them also members of the Dutch Reformed Church ) accept being called Afrikaners ; others , affronted by the ideological content of the term , object vehemently . All this makes it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as " the white tribe of Africa . " During the century following the clash with Governor Van der Stel , at least three different branches of Afrikaners emerged . Some became officials in the service of the Dutch East India Company and later of the British ; some of these displayed remarkable business and judicial acumen and were quite liberal in their views . A second group continued farming in the vicinity of Cape Town , maintaining some contact with Europe . A third group , the trekboers , many too poor to survive on their own but too proud , in a slave-owning society , to do manual labor for others , trekked into the vast interior to establish patriarchal families ? " a master , his wife , his children , and his dependents . " But gradually the frontier was closing around these trekboers ? especially after the Cape was first occupied by the British in 1795 , followed by permanent occupation in 1806 . Though most acquiesced to British rule , between 10,000 and 20,000 ( less than 20 percent of Afrikaners in the frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1840 to attempt survival on their own . This exodus brought increased contact with black peoples , and what , to whites , was a great evasion was experienced by blacks as a great invasion . In many instances the two peoples managed to negotiate some form of coexistence ; more often there was fierce conflict , culminating in Natal in the Battle of Blood River ( 1838 ) , where a few hundred Boers repelled an attack by more than 10,000 warriors of the Zulu king Dingane. 563  |p564  What force drives Afrikaners ? " The urge to be left alone , " says author Brink . Thus Boers turned their backs on British rule and pressed inland in the Great Trek of the 1830s . Once there , adds Brink , they lived " as far apart as possible : The mere sight of a neighbor 's smoke on the horizon could be reason for suspicion . " Even today , " hands off , that 's our problem " bristles from Afrikanerdom 's highest levels . In the push for elbow room , trekkers ran up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some 500 Boers defeated more than 10,000 Zulus . A painting depicts Zulus attacking a Boer camp ( above ) in an earlier battle . Victory was taken as divine approbation ; God had chosen sides . Years of battling black tribes stiffened racial attitudes . In 1948 the National Party instituted apartheid , literally " apartness . " In recent reforms many beaches , cinemas , and restaurants have been integrated . Passbooks that blacks once carried to permit travel have been abolished . But apartheid 's framework stands . Under the Group Areas Act , blacks , Coloureds ( those of mixed blood ) , and Asians must live in segregated enclaves . A tricameral Parliament gives nominal representation to Asians and Coloureds but ignores blacks who can not vote . The Afrikaner sees himself besieged by a world that demands he give up land he bled for . Most regard yielding power to a black majority as intolerable . " Once you 've given power away , you ca n't get it back , " says one . Meanwhile , South Africa sees no end to confrontation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . The centenary celebrations in 1938 , with their reenactment of the Great Trek , became the catalyst that caused Afrikaner national consciousness to crystallize in the form the world knows . Today , with Afrikanerdom torn apart by infighting , the new celebrations acquire particular significance in recasting the past in a heroic mold in an attempt to reunite the yolk ( people , nation ) . But the event also highlights divisive forces in society as two opposing series of festivals unfold ? one organized by the government , the other by the extreme right wing in the political spectrum that wishes to exploit the occasion toward the attainment of a new whites-only Afrikaner state carved out of the Republic of South Africa . Both celebrations kindle suspicion and resentment among the black majority , which perceives the threat of white supremacy reconfirmed . The discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal prompted Britain to become more aggressive toward the two small republics the trekkers had formed , and after the devastating Anglo-Boer War ( 1899-1902 ) they lost their independence . In 1910 South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep animosities surrounding that war persisted , and even today many Afrikaners react with rage to the memory of 18,000 to 28,000 women and children who died in British concentration camps ( as compared to the 7,000 Boers who died in battle ) . Ever since union two major attitudes in Afrikaner politics have prevailed ? on the one hand the conciliatory and fairly liberal policies of General ( later Field Marshal ) Smuts and his successors , on the other the narrow brand of nationalism championed by the party that finally came to power in 1948 with apartheid as its battle cry . For the first time in their history , Afrikaners had come to power in South Africa on their own , and they had no intention of relinquishing it to anyone else . They brought to their new task much of the crude skill through which they had survived for three centuries as a largely rural people . WHAT STRIKES ONE today is that so many Afrikaners ( more than 80 percent in 1985 as opposed to just over 40 percent in 1946 ) have become city dwellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York or Sydney . One of the first Afrikaners to reach the top in South African industry ? until comparatively recently the near monopoly of English and Jewish businessmen ? was Albert Wessels , who progressed from barefoot farm boy in the western Free State to chairman of Toyota South Africa Ltd. with assets of more than 300 million dollars . The white-haired , urbane Wessels , now 80 , recalls how after the AngloBoer War his parents returned to their farm to find the homestead burned down , the  |p568  orchards and garden parched , the fields barren after three years , and no stock or seed with which to start again . Yet somehow the family made a new start , and his mother , strangely unscathed by bitterness , insisted on a sound education for her children . Wessels embarked on a degree in theology ( with teaching , the traditional professions for " clever " young Afrikaners ) , but finding that he was too critical-minded for the church , turned to business instead . " It became a matter of conscience to succeed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could become the equals of the English , " he says . To Wessels , as to others like him , big business never became an end in itself but remained an effective means of furthering the " Afrikaner cause " and the image of the Afrikaner as a worthy man of the modern world . Among the younger generation of achievers there seems to be less concern about " demonstrating " something ; achievement becomes its own justification . A case in point is Naas Steenkamp who , at 55 , has reached the top in the mining profession as president of the powerful Chamber of Mines . " It 's not a matter of what group you belong to , " he says , " but of personal abilities . " @#  |p569  Even today Steenkamp has little time for " sentimentality about Afrikanerdom . " And yet . . . . Taking me outside his home high on a koppie ( hill ) in the fashionable Johannesburg suburb of Melville , Steenkamp showed me the stretch of land far below where his grandfather 's farm had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house and complete a circle . On the farms and in the little dusty dorpies ( villages ) of the interior , a new breed of Afrikaner has appeared . Larger than life among them looms Oloff Hennig , lord and master of several farms on a small fertile plateau above Piketberg . Oloff is well over six feet tall , with the physique of a buffalo and a voice like a peal of thunder . Oloff also comes from humble origins , and ' 1988 The Afrikaners it was many years before he and his wife , Gill , owned land . Once they did , Oloff became one of the first farmers in the area to buy a computer ; using the most up-to-date scientific methods , he has turned his orchards into a major concern . In South Africa he is the acknowledged king of buchu ( a medicinal herb ) , has a stake in west-coast real estate , and is a breeder of racehorses . Oloff rules over his laborers like a feudal squire of medieval times ; at the same time he has ensured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in an extensive recreation center . " Do n't talk to me about apartheid , " he says , waving a colossal hand . " I ca n't stand all this meddling by the government . Look at the schools : White schools standing half empty , Coloured schools overflowing . Why ca n't they be shared ? They should leave it to us to make our own arrangements . " NOT ALL present-day Afrikaners are well-to-do , of course . Donald Riekert , who lives in close communion with nature in Kuruman at the edge of the Kalahari Desert , actually regards wealth as the greatest curse of the Afrikaner . " The day our yolk got rich , it lost its soul , " says Riekert . " I often think that the worst sin the Afrikaner has learned to commit is to want to hold on to everything ; he 's lost the capacity to give . " Don worked in a cafe for years to support his studies by correspondence , and nowadays he runs a small photographic business while producing his own brand of folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a drought-stricken farm , feeding mostly on blackthorn honey , prickly pears , and locusts . During World War I ? at 16 , though he pretended he was 18 ? he joined the army to fight the Germans in German Southwest Africa . He stayed on for several years and returned home as a lifelong convert to the German way of life , with Bismarck , Radetzky , Moltke , and Hindenburg as his heroes . Don had planned to call his own firstborn Maxmiliaan Maria Joseph Freiherr von and zu Weichs an der Glon . But unfortunately ? or fortunately ! ? the child turned out to be a girl . Between the two World Wars a number of future cultural and political leaders studied in Germany , where they were profoundly 569  |p571  impressed by what they saw as the resurrection of German pride and strength after the humiliation of 1918 . On their return to South Africa they were faced by their own people who , economically broken by the Anglo-Boer War , were moving to the cities , establishing an entire generation of poor whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty ; that , and a terrible drought in the early thirties , linked to the Depression , threatened to extinguish the Afrikaner people . They were saved mainly by cultural and social welfare organizations inspired by political motives . Among these was the Afrikaner Broederbond , or League of Brothers , a secret organization to promote the Afrikaner cause . Significantly it was born , in the words of its initiation rite , out of " the deep conviction that the Afrikaner nation with its own nature and task was called into being in this country by God 's hand . . . for as long as it pleases God , to remain in existence . " In many of these organizations key roles were played by the leaders newly returned from Hitler 's Third Reich . They also had a hand in the continuing rewriting of Afrikaner history , creating a new mythology to bolster national consciousness , and eventually in the victory of the chauvinistic core of Afrikanerdom in the elections of 1948 . TRADITIONALLY the church has played a key role in the structuring and cohesion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ambiguous in their attitudes . Donald Riekert does n't regularly go to church , and to the horror of some of his neighbors , he has not even had his children christened . Yet he would never dream of setting out on a trip by car without first asking the Lord 's blessing . In my youth , on Oom Jannie 's farm , we had to spend the interminable Sunday afternoons indoors ? those sweltering summer days redolent of ripening fruit and crushed grapes and bruised grass , resounding with birdcalls and the alluring murmur of a cold mountain stream under ancient oak trees in the farmyard ? forced to read Bible stories or @# " uplifting literature . " Today many younger Afrikaners never set foot in a church ? although before a meal they may still hold hands and intone a prayer . There are no fewer than three Dutch Reformed Churches , each with the same confessions of faith , same language , same people , in the same country . The Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk ( NGK ) has 1.5 million members , as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of the Gereformeerde Kerk . More than 70 percent of all Afrikaners belong to the three Dutch Reformed Churches . In 1987 the extreme right wing in Afrikaner politics , rebelling against a recent decision of the NGK to open its doors to all races , formed yet a fourth branch , the Afrikaner Protestant Church . In addition , of course , there are separate Dutch Reformed Churches for Coloureds and blacks . The situation is compounded by the fact that more and more Afrikaners , ill at ease among the political tensions of the white church , become members 571 1  |p572  of these later branches . One of the first to do so was Beyers Naude , once an important figure within the Broederbond as well as a leader within the Dutch Reformed Church . In 1963 , no longer able to agree with the clandestine methods of the Broederbond , he was instrumental in exposing the organization 's secrets in the press ; soon afterward , when he refused to give up his position as editor of the liberal publication Pro veritate , he was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was placed under banning orders , and in due course he joined the ( black ) Dutch Reformed Church in Africa . " When people become entrenched in their positions as enemies , " he recently told me , " the danger is that they can no longer think of any other form of existence . It has happened in Northern Ireland . It is also happening to Afrikaners . We have lost our faculty of compassion . " Anton Vorster , the young man who was disowned by his pious father when he decided to marry a girl of mixed blood , traces many of the roots of that family break to religious experience : " The church played a central role in my youth . My father gave large amounts of money to our ' church , but when a black preacher came to the door to ask for a contribution , he was told very patronizingly to approach his own ' people . " FOR CENTURIES the church fulfilled more than a religious function in Afrikaner society : It offered almost the only occasion for social gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , brought farmers in outlying districts to town to attend the church services , and also to sell their produce , mingle with their fellowmen , and enjoy the great variety of events made up of boeresport ? pillow fights , three-legged races , catching a greased pig , tug-of-war , and innumerable others . At New Year 's this would invariably be rounded off with an allnight ball in a barn or farmyard , accompanied by drinking on a great scale ? witblits ( white lightning ) , mampoer ( peach brandy ) , or more innocuous ginger beer and lemonade . With the dawning of a more urbanized age , these social events have almost died out , though they still mark festive occasions like Heroes ' Day , New Year 's Day , or Easter Monday . In small communities eating is still a popular pastime that brings people together , whether at wedding or funeral rec:ptions , church bazaars , vendusie ( cattle auctions ) , agricultural shows , or by inviting friends over for braaivleis ( barbecue ) or potjiekos ( stew prepared in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large regional and national competitions organized annually to pick the best of these backyard cooks . Stellenbosch boasts a Gourmet Guild , which has revived traditional Cape cooking with its strong Malay influence : bobotie ( a richly flavored curried mince dish ) , waterblommetjiebredie ( a stew made with water hawthorn ) , and the like . In Namaqualand you may be invited to taste the curious mottled greenish sausage-like National Geographic , October 1988 p 575 puffadder ( springbok bowel stuffed with pluck ) , or less exotic but delicious wild cabbage bredie ( stew ) , or kidneys roasted in caul . A very special social art is that of the storyteller , a , id in the Marico region of the Transvaal , in Namaqualand , or in South-West Africa ( Namibia ) old men still can hold an audience captive for many hours with colorful anecdotes and hyperbolic tales of the feats or foolishness of country heroes . In recent years storytelling has been brought to television by the tremendously popular Jan Spies ; he has turned into national heroes the well-meaning country-bumpkin son of a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's head , or the old man who chiseled away the underside of a railway bridge to let his donkeys through . Asked why he had n't simply dug a trench in the ground , he pointed out that it was the donkeys ' ears that were too long , not their legs . In other respects television ? introduced in South Africa only in 1976 ? has ended many traditional forms of entertainment . The extent to which television has mesmerized people and broken down communication is illustrated by a recent event in Pietersburg in the northern Transvaal , where the body of the elderly Mrs. Anna Bronkhorst was discovered in front of her TV set after she had been dead for three days . Her husband , Lourens , had n't even realized that she was dead . If TV forces people indoors , it inevitably cuts one 's ties with the outdoors ? and this threatens one of the central urges in the Afrikaners ' collective consciousness , the dream of the veld . Especially during the " hundred years of solitude " of the trekboers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ability to tune in to their continent ? to adjust to the rhythms of the seasons , to face drought and flood , to read the veld and the skies , to find medicines in bushes and roots and bitter berries . THE DREAM PERSISTS . In a classic story by the early Afrikaans writer Jan van Melle , " Oom Karel Neem Sy Geweer Saam ? Uncle Karel Takes Along His Gun , " an old Boer on his deathbed comforts himself with the belief that he will be allowed to take his gun to heaven : " His life has been filled with hunting and war . He has helped clear the land ; he 's been in most of the frontier wars ; he was in every battle against the English . How would he feel in heaven without a gun ? Surely there must be something to hunt over there ? The devil is n't dead yet . Somewhere beyond our known world there must still be places to be cleared ; places where one would find dangerous animals and kinds of savages and kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slicker among Afrikaners continues to cherish , deep down , a nostalgia for the bush . Some devote their whole life to nature . Ludwig Wagner , game ranger in the Kruger National Park , points out that of 22 rangers in the park only five are of English descent ; he himself has been there for 20 years . No matter how modernized the 575  |p577  park may become , he assures me , a mere 200 yards from the road you 're back in the Africa of centuries ago . In some frontier areas of the Transvaal fear of " terrorists " has drastically changed the patterns of life : safety wires , security systems , armed commandos , and radio watch patrols characterize daily existence . But it seems that nothing will drive those Afrikaners from the land . There is something painful about the way in which they grimly persist , behind barbed wire , to pursue a life normally associated with freedom and open spaces . In another form , something of the past seems to persist in a constant wanderlust , for if a traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that a laager was made of wagons , and that the urge to explore , to trek into the unknown in search of open spaces , has been a motivating factor throughout Afrikaner history . One curious aspect of these historical evasions is singled out by the jovial Ronnie Melck of Stellenbosch , a vintner of renown and an eighthgeneration member of a family that has never left the Boland . " On more than one occasion Afrikaners trekked right out of their country , " he points out . " And where did they end up ? In the desert of Patagonia , or in the most barren region of Angola , or in the arid Enkeldoorn area of Rhodesia . I tell you , it 's because of the Calvinist streak in us : it makes us feel good when we suffer . Yet , at the same time , these experiences have strengthened us and made us more durable . " Writer Jan Rabie spent many years in Europe . " Europe taught me , " he says , " that the more my mind is opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tiny portion of it , by being an Afrikaner in a small village , in a small language . " Perhaps this " small language " is the crux of the matter , even if many Afrikaners are embarrassed by the Language Monument ( South Africa may be the only country in the world that has ever erected a monument to a living language ) . It stands on a granite hill outside the Boland town of Paarl , where the Society of True Afrikaners was formed in @# 1875 . For many years the language remained intimately associated with the " Afrikaner cause , " but in the work of a new generation of poets and fiction writers in South Africa , its frontiers have been consciously extended to include dissent . As a writer I find it tragic that the best known words Afrikaans has contributed to the vocabulary of the world are apartheid , laager , baasskap , and others in the same mold , for I know intimately the exhilaration of working in such a young , virile language . According to the poet Uys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Afrikaans at its present stage of development is comparable to Elizabethan English . This idea makes it almost a crime that in the mind of the world the language should be associated only with one political ideology . Says Chris Barnard , of the watershed generation of Sestigers ? " Writers of the Sixties " ? and 1988 president of the Afrikaans Writers ' Guild : " The Afrikaans language is our only real achievement , the only thing that 577  |p579  keeps us together . There is nothing else : neither politics nor religion nor anything else . " HISTORICALLY , the Afrikaners ' group awareness has often been defined in terms of a threat . Increasingly , since 1795 , this threat was posed by Great Britain . And it is amazing to discover , even today and even in many sophisticated Afrikaners , a deep-seated mistrust , if not actual hatred , of the English . At the very least , there is an active sense of always having to compete with the English , of having to " show " them ? exacerbated by a persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or uneducated . A friend , who gave up her librarian job to help her husband on his prospering farm in the lush subtropical eastern Transvaal , recalls with gleaming blue eyes how , when she had her baby son , an English colleague commiserated : " How awful to bring up a child in this country in times like these . Does n't it make you shudder to think he may marry a black girl one day ? " My friend 's reaction came from the guts : " I 'd rather have him marry a black girl than an English girl . " The Afrikaner has traditionally defined himself in relation to the black African . At the outset race relations were largely determined by the labor situation ( slavery and enforced employment of indigenous peoples ) . On the other hand , early Dutch sailors and colonists had no compunction about miscegenation , and as early as 1671 three-quarters of all children born to Dutch East India Company slaves were of mixed blood . Today 's Afrikaners have been estimated to have an average of 7.2 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes have prevailed ever since the late 18th century , when frontier farmers encountered black peoples in the interior . Military clashes were frequent , yet on several occasions white Afrikaners and black Africans allied themselves in attempts to repulse the British , whom both regarded as a foreign invader . White farmers and free Khoikhoi ( the nomadic people incorrectly called Hottentots ) regularly did service in the same commandos . And when , after 1828 , a number of Afrikaners left the Cape Colony in open revolt against a new British  |p580  policy proclaiming the equality of whites and Khoikhoi , some of these same " racists " settled in black communities across the frontier , submitted themselves to the authority of Xhosa chiefs ? even married black wives . While many early Afrikaners subjected indigenous people to " the most inconceivable maltreatment , " others adopted remarkably liberal attitudes . One of these was Andries Stockenstrom ( 1792-1864 ) , landdrost of the remote district of Graaff-Reinet . Confronted by angry frontiersmen who demanded to take the law in their own hands in dealing with " vagrants " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he replied : " From the principles to which I have always clung , I shall not deviate one hair's-breadth . . . . In one word , equal rights to all classes , without distinction . " Many of the younger generation have grown up expecting a volcanic eruption of black violence . This sometimes leads to vicious emotional manifestations on the extreme right . When an Afrikaner mission returned from Senegal in mid-1987 after meeting representatives of the banned African National Congress ( ANC ) , it was greeted at  |p581  Jan Smuts Airport by hostile members of the extremist AWB ( Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging ? Afrikaner Resistance Movement ) . A British Airways flight attendant carrying a black baby was confronted by the demonstrators : " Put down that child , " they shouted . " The Bible tells us not to consort with the animals of the veld , " one man cried . At the other extreme are people like the young son of a leading Afrikaner industrialist in Johannesburg who found fulfillment in being a member of a crack army unit . But studying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witwatersrand changed his outlook , and when he was called up for duty in a black township , he refused , left the country , and is now associated with the ANC . And , again , there is Anton Vorster , who now lives happily married with his wife in a white suburb of Johannesburg where more people from other races are moving in , even though a government crackdown is a constant possibility . " We have never been harassed by anybody , " he assures me . " Even the landlady of our apartment building sometimes drops in for a chat . " In the middle ground between these positions one finds an attitude demonstrated by farmers like Jan " Boland " Coetzee ? a legendary rugby player and nowadays a leading vintner in Stellenbosch ? who devotes much of his time to the improvement of labor relations on the farms . " For many years we farmers thought of nothing but capital and land . Now we 're beginning to think of people again , and the result is a change in mentality difficult to explain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my countrymen , black , white and Coloured , to believe we can find a solution together . " THE AFRIKANER WOMAN holds a difficult and ambiguous position in a strongly male-dominated society . Her role has traditionally been that of wife and mother , subservient to her husband . And even today any woman wanting to enter public life or embark on a career faces a tradition of female submissiveness . " Hers is a cruel world , " says Jeanette Ferreira , who lectures at the University of Zululand while running a household and looking after an energetic small daughter . " She remains torn by a professional life that poses enormous demands because the forefathers decreed that a woman 's business is to serve . ' She 's regarded as a newcomer who constantly has to prove herself . She feels guilt if her household or homelife does n't come first . " The poet Antjie Krog ( who explains that she comes from a line of strong women ) has another perspective : " The Afrikaner woman , in my view , is a privileged species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time granted us by cheap , intelligent , black domestic help . So we can select the tidbits and specialize in entertaining , or designing clothes , or studying , or gardening , becoming a connoisseur in silver , and making our own pots or poetry for Christmas . " Tossing back her short-cropped dark hair , the hint of a steely smile in her mocking eyes , Antjie continues : " I blame the men for it . They like it that way . The more idle their wives , the more successful they obviously must be . Most have remained totally unliberated , living the way their ancestors did ? complaining about the government , hunting up north , or telling racist jokes in clouds of braaivleis smoke . " But there is another side to being an Afrikaner woman . If she generally retreats into her home , she also turns it into a stronghold . Historically she has played a key role in the  |p583  survival of the species : When many menfolk were prepared to surrender to British annexation of Natal after the Great Trek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Drakensberg peaks rather than lose their freedom . In the Anglo-Boer War their determination to survive the concentration camps kept their husbands fighting in the veld . " The Afrikaner woman is always in the kitchen , always organizing everybody 's life , always in the very center of everything , " explains Rachel Breytenbach . Rachel 's family is an eloquent illustration of this viewpoint . Her four brothers represent the full political spectrum among whites in the country , from Jan , the eldest , whose exploits as an army commander during the first South African incursion into Angola in 1975 made him a hero in the military establishment , to the poet Breyten , who spent seven years in a South African jail as a convicted terrorist for allegedly plotting against the state . " The tensions in our family were almost unbearable at times , " says Rachel . " The one who tried to keep us together was my mother . Whenever a quarrel broke out , she would retreat to the kitchen and come back with the 0.1988 The Afrikaners  |p584  favorite food of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her love and of patching up hostilities . And it worked . " Because of her position in the family the Afrikaner woman has been able to exert a very strong influence on her children and on patterns of social intercourse . Which is why Marina Geertsema can affirm : " Women , more than anybody else , have kept traditional values alive . " By acting as custodians of " the system , " women have maintained both the good and the evil inherent to South African society . But Jeanette Ferreira is optimistic : " I can see a whole younger generation of mothers like myself emerging , who are lovingly but resolutely beginning to liberate their children from all the preconceived roles . " IN ALMOST EVERY SPHERE one finds evidence of an old Afrikaner order breaking down . There are still those whose lives are ruled primarily by ideology , the " super Afrikaners , " while others have adopted more open value systems . Hardy Botha , one of the most dazzlingly imaginative artists in the country , has had his work accepted by international exhibitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his youth and his maturity : By birth a staunch Gerhardus , he prefers the more congenial name Hardy ( which reaches back to his mother 's Scottish ancestry ) . " I 'm scared by nationalism , " he says bluntly . " I grew up with it , and I know how destructive it can be . It is shaped by the same instinct that causes gangs and mobs , and my worst nightmares are about mobs : You cpr see that in my paintings , ca n't you ? All those carnivals and witches ' sabbaths are a way of exorcising the idea of the mob . " In the end it comes down to a question of definition . And Breyten Breytenbach , now living in exile in Paris , eloquently makes the point : " I am an Afrikaans-speaking South African , bound to Africa , and living in Europe for the time being . But one can not escape from what one is . " On the bistro terrace where we sit , late autumn sun beats on Breyten 's tanned face ; passersby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have never heard . Then the world streams on again . To be an Afrikaner is a schizophrenic experience . " We belong to Africa , yet too many of us think of ourselves as European , " says Breyten . " That 's why politics in South Africa is such a deadly serious business . With everything we do , our whole future is at stake . " Africa and Europe : Always it comes back to this . The Africa discovered by early trekboers , who survived because they had learned to tune in to the heartbeat of a wild continent , but which they betrayed when apartheid was devised to justify white European supremacy . " The enduring tragedy of the Afrikaner , " says Frederik van Zyl Slabbert , erstwhile leader of the white opposition in the Parliament , who quit his position to explore other democratic alternatives , " is that he is a white African who refuses to come to terms with his own continent and its people . Most of them still wish to be here but apart , and after more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still has not come home . "
