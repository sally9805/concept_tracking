 | In 1953 my husband , Warren , and I were happily expecting our first child . My best friend , Earlene , was also pregnant , and she and I went to the doctor 's together , swapped child-care books , and compared symptoms . We were at the obstetrician 's one day when a big snowstorm hit our town , Salt Lake City , and delayed some buses . When we left the doctor 's office , we had to struggle several blocks to another route where the buses were still running . As we stood waiting for the bus , a strange weakness came over me ; in addition I was sure I could smell rubber burning , my hearing began to fade , and my vision closed in so I could n't see anything but a small tunnel-like area directly in front of me . At the same time I had a curious sensation of having stepped " outside myself , " where I could sense that my balance was gone . I was literally afraid to move . I tried to ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though we never splurged on taxis , she hailed one and brought me to her mother 's house , where after a little chicken soup and a short nap , I was as good as new . Of course I reported the symptoms to my obstetrician . " Do n't you know that swooning just because you 're pregnant is out of style , " he said , laughing , and I laughed with him . When I suffered several more similar episodes , the doctor lectured me on nutrition and the need for adequate rest . Finally , in exasperation , he admonished me to " curtail my vivid imagination . " In June Warren and I welcomed our son , Robin , and I was relieved that my dizzy spells were a thing of the past . But in October I discovered that I was pregnant again , and to my distress , the same strange symptoms reappeared ; this time the doctor attributed them to my becoming pregnant too soon . It seemed plausible , but when the attacks went on after the baby , our daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My husband and I wanted a large family , and I became pregnant for a third time . I expected the strange physical symptoms to continue and I was right , but our son Morton was safely born in 1956 . With my fourth pregnancy the next year I noticed that the spells were increasing in frequency , and for the first time I began to be afraid to leave the house . After Tamara was born in 1957 , I pressured my obstetrician for a diagnosis . " You do have a persistent anemia , " he said . " It is a rather common problem among Nordic types with blue eyes . " " Are you trying to tell me I 'm just another dizzy blonde ? " I joked , and we both had a good laugh at my expense . Little by little I was reaching the conclusion that if doctors did n't take my problems seriously , why should I ? However when I became pregnant for the fifth time , for the entire nine months I ran a low-grade fever , was anemic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told , suffering from a strange blood disorder . Dozens of doctors were brought in for consultations , but no one could figure out what was wrong with me . Julia , our fifth and final child , was born in 1959 . Then in 1962 I contracted hepatitis and came as close to dying as anyone can and still survive . I slipped in and out of a coma for almost a month . Gradually I recovered , but the dizzy  | spells were worse than ever : I no longer remembered the days these episodes occurred , but instead only remembered the few days when they did not . My doctor felt I had a psychological " hangover " from my close encounter with death . Time and outside activities would solve my anxieties , he assured me . A specialist finally diagnosed my blood disorder ? acute hypogammaglobulinemia , an almost complete failure of the body 's immune system , which explained the severe hepatitis and other illnesses . Though my blood disorder could not cause the kind of dizzy spells I was experiencing , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my troubles . One day I suffered one of my strange episodes in my family doctor 's office . Though I had just about despaired of getting any doctor to understand my pain , I did tell him , " I am having one of those spells right this minute . " He took my pulse , noted that it was rapid , and had me lie down while he left the room . " If it 's anything serious , " he said , " it should soon progress into something we can detect . " He was gone for almost a half hour , and when he returned , I was feeling fine again . Abruptly he asked , " You have five children do n't you ? " " Yes , " I stammered . " Housewife 's syndrome , " he announced . " Lots of kids , too much responsibility , boring job . I see women like you all the time . " He then went on to describe me and " other women " as smart but frustrated , unhappy with our lots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of excitement and attention from our constant trips to the doctor 's . " You need to get out of the house and live a little , " he concluded brightly . He had n't described me at all , but I apologized to him as I got up to leave . He handed me my first bottle of tranquilizers . They did help me in a way ? they kept me so sedated I gave up trying to find a solution to my suffering . Only when I saw a new physician would I dare confide my troubling symptoms . I saw countless doctors during this period , all of them intrigued by my rare blood disorder . Each new person listened to me but paid more attention to my chart , which was peppered with opinions about " housewife 's syndrome " and my need to invent symptoms . Sensing their skepticism , I would apologize for feeling the way I did . I was , in fact , a " model patient , " giving in , agreeing , never questioning , always making little jokes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin , " I 'm sorry to be so much trouble , but then a bad penny will always turn up , wo n't it ? " Seven years went by ? from 1964 to 1971 ? and I was being treated only with tranquilizers . It 's hard to describe how desperate my life was . The children were growing up ( the older ones were now teenagers ) , and our family was in turmoil because of my problems . Warren , who was working at the postal service , had to take on a second job to pay my medical expenses . Now , it seemed , even the most ordinary activities triggered frightening episodes of dizziness , tunnel vision , and a feeling of losing my balance . I could not go to the store alone but had to take the children with me , sending them through the checkout line , which particularly bothered me . I could n't car pool ; it was frightening enough to be responsible for my own children ? I could not risk driving others . Nor could I take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows left me in a total panic . Worse yet , the tranquilizers made me so tired and apathetic , the children had to do most of the housework . Eventually the doctor doubled the dosage of tranquilizers , and the combination of medication and dizzy spells so clouded my memory I often did not remember what the children told me . This gave rise to countless arguments . Once I roused the entire neighborhood at 2:00 A.M. because I thought Robin had n't come home from a party . We found him sleeping in his bed . He had come in and said good-night to me , but it just had n't registered . The neighbors ' description of my mental state was blunt and accurate : " Her porch light 's on , but nobody 's home . " The next day my husband , Warren , had another talk with our family doctor , and I could tell when he got home that he too was becoming convinced that I had no real problems . Acting on what he believed was sound medical advice , he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I had learned were impossible for me . He 'd hand me the car keys , saying , " It 's your day to drive , " or he 'd plan excursions to get me out of the house . T hen , one weekend in 1971 , we tried one last family outing . And it was because of that trip that my life was changed . My children and I sat in the front row of a train that was to take us down into a mine . The moment we entered the tunnel , a revolving headlight was turned on , and I knew I was in trouble . " Do you smell something burning ? " I asked quickly . No one did , so I knew I was imagining things again . To distrast myself , I stared at the headlight . And as I did , I felt so terrible I tried to pop a few antidizziness pills into my mouth . But it was too late . I was overcome with that awful feeling again : My vision narrowed to a pinpoint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled my nostrils , and I could n't move . Finally the train stopped , the headlight was turned off , and I recovered myself somewhat . On the ride back we were seated in the rear of the car ; the probing headlight was too far away for me to see . For some reason this made me feel better , and once we were back on the surface I felt fine . Till I saw the looks of disappointment on my family 's face . Once again I had spoiled an outing because of my illness ? and they were disgusted with me . Yet everyone kept telling me there was nothing wrong wih me . There could be only one explanation left , I realized : I must be insane . At that point I was ready to commit myself to the state mental hospital . The next week Warren and I saw our family doctor to discuss the procedures for my admission . He had been the one to originally suggest the plan and agreed now . First , he added , I would have to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took me by surprise with his first question : " What do you think is wrong with you ? " No doctor had ever asked for my opinion before . " I think I 'm losing my mind , " I said . " What makes you think that ? " he shot back . " Because everyone says so , " I answered , and I went on to tell him everything , from my first dizzy spell to my problems driving , staying in the checkout line ? everything up to the mine tunnel and the bright light . The neurologist interrupted me . " Is there a flashing light at the checkout stand in the store ? " he asked . It seemed a strange question to ask a woman who was insane . " Yes , " I said . " And when you 're waiting for a left turn , is there a flashing light on your  | dashboard ? Flashing lights when you drive at night ? Maybe some faulty fluorescents in places you 're afraid of ? " I nodded yes to his questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted some preliminary tests and gave me the first neurological workup I had ever had in 19 years of intensive medical care ! They were the standard neurological tests ? I was told to close my eyes and touch my nose ; close my eyes and stand with arms out ; stand on one leg and touch my knee with the other foot . I could n't do any of them . Next I was led to the electroencephalograph room , with its intimidating array of electrodes that were attached to my scalp . After a few other tests I was told to breathe very rapidly . Even then I experienced nothing more alarming than a feeling that the whole room was on fire . While I was trying to calm myself down , the technician turned on a strobe light just inches from my face . Immediately , kaleidoscopic pictures whirled faster and faster in my mind 's eye , and I knew I was out of control . I closed my eyes to make the whole awful experience go away . W hen I opened my eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on , and the doctor was looking down at me . " How do you feel ? " he asked . " A little dizzy , " I lied , " but otherwise okay . " He smiled that knowing smile I had learned to hate in other physicians . After freshening up , I went back to his office to sign the commitment papers . The doctor asked if I had my tranquilizers with me . When I handed them to him he just threw them into the trash can . And then he totally shocked me . " You 've suffered for enough years , " he said , as he handed me another bottle of pills . " This is Dilantin and it 's used to control seizures . " I stared at him in disbelief . " But I have housewife 's syndrome , " I said . " Never heard of it , " the doctor answered . " What you have is some slight damage to the left temporal lobe of your brain , which controls how you see , feel , smell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be no more pressure than that of a piece of paper ? but it 's enough to cause your troubles . " The doctor went on to explain that flashing lights were often the trigger for the kind of psychomotor seizures I suffered . He also told me that this damage to the brain , which is a form of epilepsy , typically occurs during the birth process but could have happened at and time . I may have had a few seizures when I was younger , but my pregnancies really accelerated them . Warren and I left in a state of shock . and when we reached the parking lot . he leaned his head against the car and wept . I knew how guilty he felt for not believing me . " I do n't understand , " he said . " How can you be so calm , not shed one tear ? " " Why should I cry ? " I answered " Today somebody finally understands . " The neurologist set to work to reverse the damage that had been done by all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeedec so well I finally had the courage to face the family physician who had first categorized me as a victim of " housewife 's syndrome . " " How could you have been so wrong ? " I demanded . " I do n't believe you ever told me your symptoms , " he said as he flipped to the front of my voluminous chart . There , on the first page , he had written down my chief complaint : frequent dizziness , weakness , visual disturbances . strange smells . It was a lucid and clinically correct description of what it is like to experience a psychomotor seizure . And next to it the doctor had written : Usual bored housewife ; tends to exaggerate her problems . He looked up at me and shrugged . " I 'm not a neurologist , " he said . It was an honest mistake . " But I could n't accept that . Would a man walking into a doctor 's office with my complaints have been told he had " housewife 's syndrome " or would he have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her busy time schedule , would have demanded some answers . But as a full-time homemaker I could adapt my schedule to accommodate my seizures without realizing I was doing it . And as a homemaker I could believe I had something called " housewife 's syndrome . " Today I have picked up the threads of my life . The children are all grown and on their own . I am writing a novel , and Warren is still at the postal service , where he is manager of customer services for the state of Utah . Sometimes I think about the ending of that last conversation I had with my family physician . " You have other housewives as patients , " I said to him . " Do you really listen to them now ? " " I think so , " he said after a long moment . " At least I 'll try a little harder because of you . " And that at least makes me feel I achieved something after those long years of suffering .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
