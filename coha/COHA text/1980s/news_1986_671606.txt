The signature dance of " Sweet Charity , " famously heralded by the raunchy downbeat provided by the composer Cy Coleman , is " Big Spender " - in which the painted hostesses of a New York tango palace joylessly entice their customers to a " good time " from behind the long railing that borders their nightly encampment . The bleak yet affectionate deadpan humor of the staging is worthy of Reginald Marsh drawings of Depression honky-tonks . Even more impressive is that moment when the women suddenly come together to move as a single , finger-snapping organism through the blue nocturnal light : the various bodies form a syncopated Rube Goldberg contraption , a pulsating sculpture of human neon advertising soulless sex . This is a glimpse of hell - lewd , fleshy , funny - as only an inspired student of burlesque like Mr. Fosse could imagine it. // None of these routines would deliver if they weren ' t outfitted with galvanizing dancers and music . Mr. Fosse ' s corps is first-rate , and the choreography has been drilled to that precise point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Robert Randolph ' s sets and lighting . No less attention has been paid to the cinematic staging transitions , in which the dancers , often seen in silhouette and crowned by flashing title cards , assume characteristic Fosse postures ( knees turned in , fingers spread out ) to give " Sweet Charity " the look of silent-film comedy . Mr. Coleman ' s accompanying , rousing show tunes are trumpeted by the belting voices , percussion-minded orchestrations ( by Ralph Burns ) and swinging band ( led by Fred Werner ) that this kind of musical requires. // Be warned that the kind of musical in question is the tired-businessman ' s entertainment , mid-1960 ' s subdivision . With its mildly off-color jokes , laughably spurious song cues , jolly subway straphangers and rolling cartfuls of living-room scenery , the form seems as dated as the miniskirts and hoop earrings of Patricia Zipprodt ' s tongue-in-cheek period costumes . Yet it says a lot about how the Broadway musical has deteriorated - as gloomily exemplified by Mr. Fosse ' s own current " Big Deal " - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its day , seems to have appreciated in value now . This is attributable to the decline of the competition , not to an improvement in the show ' s quality. // While Mr. Coleman has modestly modernized the sound of a couple of songs , Neil Simon ' s hapless script could still use major surgery . Maybe the author himself might choose to forget this book , which starts off flat and reaches oblivion by the fumbled bittersweet conclusion . In remaking Fellini ' s Roman prostitute into a Manhattan taxi dancer , Mr. Simon created a love-starved heroine ( named Charity Hope Valentine , no less ) of such sentimentalized masochism that she makes a doormat seem like the Rock of Gibraltar . Only Dorothy Fields ' s delightful lyrics lavish some humor and compassion on the stereotyped " girls and chicks " of the evening . The lyricist , who died in 1974 , sardonically imagined that dance-hall hostesses would aspire to a bourgeois respectability in which they eat " frozen peaches and cream " and wear " a copy of a copy of a copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Simon ' s words benefit much from the acting , which is mostly broad . Bebe Neuwirth and Allison Williams , as the heroine ' s hardened sidekicks , are better seen dancing than heard wisecracking ; Mark Jacoby brings a robust voice but little else to the role of an Italian film star . Far superior is Michael Rupert , whose kindly charm redeems Charity ' s Mr. Right , a milquetoast in a gray-flannel suit whom she meets in a stalled elevator at the 92d Street Y. Lee Wilkof is another happy exception to the general comic pushiness , summoning up the Runyonesque spirit of Stubby Kaye as the brash but good-hearted Fan-Dango Ballroom proprietor. // Miss Allen may have spent a bit too much time in television since her memorable Anita in the 1980 " West Side Story " ; her joking , too , can be overstated , and she doesn ' t find the pathos in the Fields lyric for " Where Am I Going . " But if she somewhat lacks the vulnerability of the original Charity , Gwen Verdon ( who assisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her re-creation of her predecessor ' s Chaplinesque gait and sparkling gymnastics . Let Mr. Fosse place his sizzling star before his phalanx of dancers , and a vastly imperfect musical ignites , as if by spontaneous combustion , into a rollicking show. // A Musical Romp SWEET CHARITY , book by Neil Simon ; music by Cy Coleman ; lyrics by Dorothy Fields ; based upon an original screenplay by Federico Fellini , Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano ; directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse ; scenery and lighting by Robert Randolph ; costumes by Patricia Zipprodt ; musical direction by Fred Werner ; orchestrations by Ralph Burns ; production manager , Phil Friedman .
