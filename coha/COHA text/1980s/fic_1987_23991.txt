S T OR Y THE BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA By Hanif Kureishi 0 ne day , when my father came home from work , he put his briefcase away behind the door and stripped to his undershirt and shorts in the front room . He spread the pink towel with the rip in it on the floor . He got onto his knees  --  and he was by no means a flexible man  --  placed his arms beside his head , and kicked himself into the air . " I must practice , " he said . " Practice for what , Dad ? " Now he was standing on his head on the pink towel . His stomach sagged . His balls and prick fell forward . The muscles on his arms swelled and he breathed energetically . My grandmother , who was not unkind but no physical radical , came into the room with a cup of tea . She looked at Dad and looked at me . " Practice , practice , practice , " Dad said . Grandma raised her gray head and called out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again ! " " Leave it , Grandma , " I said . " Please . " " What are you , a policeman ? " she said . She called out once more . " Margaret ! Just when we 're having our tea ! " Soon my mother hurried into the room to see Hanif Kureishi is a British film writer , journalist , and fiction writer . Kureishi was nominated for an Academy Award for his screenplay for My Beautiful Laundrette . His new movie , Sammy and Rosie Get Laid , will be released in the United States later this year . the spectacle . She wore an apron and wiped her hands again and again on a tea towel . " Oh God , Haroon , " she said to my father . " Oh God , oh God , oh God . All the front of you 's sticking out like that so everyone can see ! " She looked at me violently . " You encourage him to be like this ! " " No I do n't . " " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held her head . " Why ca n't he be a normal husband ? " My grandmother blew on her tea . " Do n't upset yourself , " she said . " That 's why he 's doing it . " " That 's not true , " said . My mother 's voice rose . " Pull the curtains , someone ! " " It 's not necessary , Mum . " " Do it now ! " I quickly pulled the curtains on our back garden . We sat there for a while and looked at oblivious , upside-down Father . Neither my mother nor my grandmother smiled or said anything . When my father spoke his voice came out squashed and thin . His insides must have got pretty bent up when he did his positions . " Karim , Karim , read to me from the book . " I fetched the book from among all his other books on Buddhism , Hinduism , Confucianism , and Sufism , which he bought at the Oriental bookshop in Cecil Court off Charing Cross Road . l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breathing in , holding his breath , breathing out and holding his breath . I read  --  and I was a good reader , fancying myself at sixteen a potential actor : " Suryanamaskar revives and maintains a spirit of youthfulness , an asset beyond price . It is wonderful to know that you are ready to face up to life and extract from it all the teal joy it has to offer . " He grunted his approval at each sentence and then opened his eyes , seeking out my mother . But she had her hand over her face . I read on : " This position also prevents loss of hair and reduces any tendency to grayness . " That was the coup . Satisfied , my father stood up . " I feel better . " " Have you finished then ? " Mother said . " For today . But I see it as a very regular thing . " " Oh no , " she groaned . He softened . " By the way , Margaret , coming to Mrs. Cooper 's tonight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on , sweetie . Please . Let 's just go out together for once . " " But it is n't me that Cheryl wants to see , " my mother said . " It 's you . She ignores me . She treats me like muck . I 'm not Indian enough for her . " " You could wear a sari , " he said . This was my opportunity . " I 'll come with you then , to Cheryl 's , if you want me to . I 'd planned to go to the chess club but I 'll make the effort . " l said this as innocently as a vicar , not wanting to stymie things by seeming too eager . I find that in life if you 're too eager others tend to get less eager . And if you 're less eager it tends to make others more eager . So the more eager I am the less eager I seem . Dad slapped his bare stomach rapidly with both hands . The noise was loud and unattractive . It filled our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room like bad news . " O.K. , " Dad said to me . " You get changed , Karim . " He turned to my mother . " Margaret , Margaret . If only you 'd come . " " I 'm not wanted . " " You 're pathetic , " I said hotly . " Yes , I 'm pathetic . " And I added , having been reading Nietzsche recently : " You do n't matter , " She sighed , having been reading the Gospel : " No , I do n't matter . " charged upstairs to get changed . I could hear my parents talking downstairs . Would he persuade her to come ? I hoped not . My father was more cheerful when my mother was n't around . It took me a long time to get ready . But at seven o'clock I came down dressed for Cheryl 's . I had on turquoise flared trousers ; a blue andwhite flower-patterned see-through shirt ; blue suede boots with Cuban heels ; and a scarlet Indian waistcoat with gold stitching around the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On top of all this I put on my grandmother 's fur coat , strapping a belt around my stomach . I was right up-to-date . My father waited at the door for me , his hands in his pockets . He had on a black polo-neck sweater , black leather jacket , and gray cords . He looked very handsome . When he saw me again he looked agitated . " You have n't shaved , " he said . " No . And now there is n't time . I forgot . " " Well . Next time . " He could be kind like that . Unlike Mum , he was no big conformist . In the living room my mother was watching TV and eating a big bag of sweets . Without turning round she said : " Karim , do n't show yourself up . Get changed ! You ca n't go out like that ! " " What about Grandma ? " I said . " What about her ? " " Well ... she 's got blue hair , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman ! " My father and I got out of the house as quickly as we could . At the top of the street we caught a bus . It was n't far  --  about four miles to the Coopers ' . But my father would n't have been able to get there without me . I knew the streets and every bus route and shortcut perfectly . I spent as much time as I could outside the house . My father had been in Britain since 1948 ? twenty-two years  --  and for eighteen of those years the family had lived in the South London suburbs . But he still stumbled around the place like a new immigrant . He asked people incredible questions like : " Is Dover in Kent ? " I would have thought , as an employee of the British government , as a Civil Service clerk , he 'd just have to know these things . But he did n't . I 'd crawl under the table with embarrassment when he halted strangers in the street to ask directions to places that were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for almost two decades . But people were n't repelled by his naivet ? , and women seemed drawn by his innocence ; they wanted to wrap their arms around him or something , so lost and boyish he looked at times . Not that he was a complete innocent . When I was small and we 'd sit in Lyons Corner House he 'd send me like a messenger pigeon to an attractive woman at another table and have me announce : " My daddy wants to give you a kiss . " Looking at him , they were never offended ; they were inevitably amused . So he taught me how to flirt with everyone ; but I do n't think he 'd slept with anyone but my mother while married . I suspected that Mrs. Cheryl Cooper  --  whom Dad met at a " writing for pleasure " class  --  wanted to chuck her arms around him . On the way to Mrs. Cooper 's we stopped off at a pub and had a pint of bitter each . I was n't used to alcohol and became drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " She does n't join things . It 's only my damn effort keeping this whole family together ! No wonder I need to make my mind blank ! " I suggested : " Why do n't you get divorced ? " " Because you would n't like it , " he said . " Otherwise  --  who knows . " " I see . It 's all up to me then . " But I knew they would n't divorce , even though they fought all the time . It was n't something that could possibly occur to them . In the suburbs I knew , people rarely dreamed of striking out for happiness . It was all familiarity and endurance . Nothing would change . the Coopers were better off than us and had a bigger house , with a drive and a garage . Their place stood on its own in the tree-lined road off Beckenham High Street . It had an attic , a greenhouse , three bedrooms , and central heating . I did n't recognize Mrs. Cooper when she greeted us at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The only thing she had on was a full-length multicolored caftan . Her hair was down , and out , and up , and wild-looking . She could have benefited from my headband . Her eyes she 'd darkened with kohl . Her feet were bare , the toes painted green . My mother never painted her fingers or toes . When the front door was safely shut , Cheryl hugged my father and kissed him all over his face . This was the first time I 'd seen him kissed with interest . There was no sign of Mr. Cooper , When Cheryl moved , when she turned to me , she was like a human crop-sprayer , puffing out clouds of Eastern-smelling perfume , like some of the hippie girls I went to concerts with at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm . I was trying to think if Cheryl was the most sophisticated person I 'd ever met , or the most pretentious , when she kissed me on the lips . She looked me all over and kept saying : " Karim , Karim , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! " " Thank you , Mrs. Cooper . If I 'd had more notice I 'd have dressed up . " " With your father 's wonderful wit too , I see ! " she said , I looked up and saw that Paul , her son , who was at my school but a year older , was sitting at the top of the stairs , behind the banisters . He was smiling at me . On the way to Cheryl 's I 'd deliberately excluded him from my mind . I had n't believed that he would be in , that he would have stayed in to see me , that he would n't have had something terrifically important to do that evening , like doing a psychedelic painting , playing a noisy gig with his band , or making love to his girlfriend at a party . " Hallo baby , " he said to me , coming downstairs . " Glad to see you . " He embraced my father and called him by his first name . What confidence and style Paul had ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuck was going on ? Cheryl had pushed back the furniture . The Liberty-patterned armchairs and Habitat glass-topped tables were up against the bookshelves . The curtains were pulled . Four middle-aged men and four middle-aged ' women , all white ( terribly white ) , all suburban , sat cross-legged on the floor , eating peanuts and drinking wine . There was some terrible old-fashioned chanting music playing that reminded me of funerals . " Do n't you just love Bach , " Paul said . " It 's not really my bag . " " O.K. Fair enough . It 's not everyone 's . I think I 've got something that 's more your bag upstairs . " " Where 's your dad ? " " He 's having a nervous breakdown . " " Oh . " " He 's gone back to his mother . " " I see . " I realized then that in a lot of ways we were just a plain family . Divorces and nervous breakdowns were n't really within our ambit ; nervous breakdowns were as exotic to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a straitjacket , perhaps in a padded cell . Now my father was sitting on the floor , talking to some of the people in the room . The talk was of music and books , of people like Dvo'fg.k , Krishnamurti , and Jung . Looking at them closely I reckoned the men were in advertising or design or something almost artistic like that . I remembered that Paul 's father designed advertisements . Whoever these people were , there was a terrific amount of showing off going on  --  more in this room than in the whole of the rest of southern England put together . At home my father would have roared with laughter at all this hot air , telling my mother how much he hated jumped-up people . But now , in the thick of it , he looked as if he was having the highest time of his whole life . He was leading the discussion , talking quickly and loudly . He talked over other people and kept interrupting them and he was n't afraid of touching whoever was nearest . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him on the floor . I wondered why he saved all the sullenness and resentful grunting for us . Did these people know he 'd sit with his back to us , his supper on his knees , staring out at the back garden while we ate unhappily at the table ? Did they know he would go a fortnight without speaking to any of us ? I noticed that a man who was sitting near me turned to the man next to him and indicated my father . Dad was now in full flow about the oneness of the cosmos with a woman who was wearing nothing but a man 's shirt and a pair of black tights . The woman kept nodding enthusiastically at Dad . The man said to his friend : " Why has Cheryl brought this brown Indian here ? " " To give us a demonstration of the mystic arts . " And has he got his camel parked outside ? " " No , he came on a magic carpet ! " I gave the man a mean little kick in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , and touched the palms of my hands together and bowed my head . I could hardly believe it myself , but he did the same back to me . Paul turned to me . " Pretentious , " he said . " What ? " I moved closer to him , holding his arm . " Yes , the sound of one buttock farting . " " Come to my pad , Karim . " " O.K. , let 's go . " Before we could leave the room , Cheryl came back in and turned off the lights . Over the one remaining lamp she draped a large , diaphanous neck scarf . I noticed that her movements had become rather balletic . One by one people fell silent . Cheryl looked down and around at everyone , smiling like mad . " So why do n't we relax ? " she said . Three or four of them nodded their agreement . Someone said : " So why do n't we ? " " Yes , yes , ' . " someone else said . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his mouth as wide as he could and thrust his tongue out . Cheryl turned to my father and waved her arm at him . " My good and deep friend Haroon here , he will show us the way . The Path . " " Oh Christ , " I whispered to Paul , thinking how my father could n't even find his way to Beckenham . " Christ Almighty . " " Watch , watch , " Paul said . My father stood up and Cheryl sat down . Now Dad moved easily among the sitting people . They looked keenly and expectantly at him , though two men glanced at each other as if they wanted to laugh . Dad spoke slowly and with confidence , as if he knew for sure he had all their attention and they 'd do everything he asked . I was sure he had never done anything like this before . He was going to wing it . " The things that are going to happen to you this evening are going to do you a lot of good . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing you must not do . You must not resist . If you resist it will be hopeless . If you resist it will be like trying to drive a car with the brakes on . " He paused . They did n't take their eyes off him . " We 'll do some floor work . Please sit with your legs apart . " They parted their legs . " Raise your arms . " They raised their arms . " Now , breathing out , stretch down to your right foot . " They all stretched out for their right foot , the women being more flexible and graceful than the men . They came up , looking a little flushed and distracted . " Down to your left foot ! And hold it ! " After five or six basic positions which 1 recognized from the yoga book Dad had got out of the library , he had them lying on their backs . Obviously unused to exercise , they were giad to be resting . To his soft commands they were relaxing their fingers one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles , their foreheads , their scalps . They were making the low " Om " sound , their stomachs vibrating . They were imagining beaches , gardens , and palm trees . They were taking a psychic holiday . Even I felt weak . Meanwhile Dad had removed his shirt and undershirt , shoes and socks . He padded around the circle of dreamers , lifting an arm here , a leg there , testing them for tension . Cheryl , lying there on her back , was watching my father with one eye open . When he walked past she lightly touched his foot with her hand . She pinched his big toe . My mother was eating sweets in front of the TV . I hissed to Paul : " Let 's get out of here before we 're hypnotized like these fucking idiots . " " O.K , But is n't it fascinating ? " " Absolutely unique . " Paul and I climbed the ladder to the attic , where he had the whole huge space to himself . It stretched out across the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hippie heads on the sloping walls and low ceiling . His drum kit stood in the center of the floor , Big cushions were flung about . " Heard anything good lately ? " " Yeah , " I said . After the . calm silence of the living room our voices sounded absurdly loud and strained . " The new Stones ' album . Get Yer Ya-Ya 's Out it 's called . I played it at the school music society today and people threw off their jackets and ties and danced . I was on top of my desk ! You should have been there . " I knew immediately that I 'd been crude . Paul threw his hair back . " On top of your desk ? I think I 'd better play you something really good , Karim . " So he put on Pink Floyd 's Umrnctgumma . While I forced myself to listen he sat opposite me cross-legged and rolled a joint . " Your father . He 's the best . He 's wise . D' you do that stuff every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A nod ca n't be a lie . " And chanting too ? " he asked . " Chanting ? No , not chanting every day . At least not in the morning . " I thought of the morning in our place : the toast on fire ; me frantically conjugating French verbs for my first class ; my father running around the house , his face covered in shaving cream , looking for his train pass ; my sister and I wrestling over the newspaper ; my mother complaining about having to go to work in the shoe shop . Paul handed me the joint . I pulled on it and handed it back . I had never taken drugs before . I was so excited and dizzy I stood up immediately . " What are you doing ? " " I have to go to the bathroom . " " Now ? " " Yes , yes ! " I flew down the attic ladder . In the Coopers ' bathroom there were framed theater posters for Genet plays . There were bamboo and parchment Zen scrolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidet . As I sat taking it all in , I realized suddenly and with excitement I wanted all my life to be lived this intensely : mysticism , alcohol , sexual promise , clever people , and drugs . I had n't come upon it all like this before , but now I wanted nothing else . And Paul ? Paul had the longest hair in the school . Parted in the center , it curtained his face and fell straight down his back . He was a painter , a poet , a musician , as well as the school rebel . He had a motorbike and a girlfriend with pre-Raphaelite hair . To me Paul was a god . But my love for him was unusual : it was not generous . I admired him more than anyone but I did n't wish him well . It was that i preferred him to me : I wanted to be him . 1 wanted his talents , his skills , his face , his taste . I wanted to wake up with them all transferred to me . Beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew it was Dad because he was crying out , " Oh my God , oh my God , oh my God , " across the Beckenham gardens , with little concern for the neighbors . Was I conceived like this , I wondered , in the suburban night air , to the wailing of Christian curses from the mouth of a Moslem masquerading as a Buddhist ? Suddenly Cheryl slapped her hand over my father 's mouth . This was a little peremptory , I thought , though I refrained from objecting . But my God , Cheryl could bounce ! Head back , eyes to stars , kicking up from the grass like a footballer , her hair flew . But what of the crushing weight on my father 's backside ? Surely the impress of the thrusting bench would remain for days burnt into his poor buttocks , like grill marks on a steak ? Should n't I rescue him ? This could not be pleasure . Then Cheryl released her hand from his mouth and he started to laugh and laugh . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure all right . I rapidly crawled away , wondering if Cheryl was watching my wriggling rear . In her kitchen I poured myself a glass of whiskey and threw it down my throat . Paul was lying on his back on the attic floor . I took off my boots and lay down beside him . He passed me the joint he was smoking . " So , Paul . Everything all right ? " " You 're all right , Karim . You 're terrific . " " Am I ? " I was encouraged and uplifted by his words . " But listen , " he said . " You 're not to take this badly . " " No , never . " " You 've got to wear less . " " Wear less , Paul ? " " Dress less . Yes . " He got up onto one elbow and concentrated on me . I loved his beautiful mouth being this close . " Levi 's , I suggest , with an open-necked shirt , maybe in pink or purple , and a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headband ? " " Yeah . " I ripped my headband off and tossed it across the floor . " For your mum , " I said . He laughed . " You see , Karim , you tend to look a little like a pearly queen in that gear . " " A pearly queen ? I see . " l , who wanted only to be like him , as clever , as artistic , as attractive in every way , tattooed his words on my brain . Levi 's , with an open-necked shirt , maybe in purple or pink . I would never go out in anything else for the rest of my life . While I contemplated myself and my entire 50 HARPERS MAGAZINE / JUNE wardrobe with absolute loathing and wished to urinate on the lot , Paul lay there massively calm with his eyes closed . Everyone in the damn house but me was practically in heaven . And the dope was refusing to fly me anywhere . When I put my hand on Paul 's thigh he made no response . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the ends of my fingers . Then I moved my hand up a couple of inches . His eyes remained closed . But in his jeans he was growing , the dirty bastard . I grew confident . I became insane . I dashed for his belt , for his fly , for his cock , and I took him out to air . I held him without moving my hand for several hours , thinking of nothing but whether I should go on , go back , or remain . But then he twitched himself . A sign ! He was alive too ! Whenever I stopped moving he twitched himself . Through such human electricity we understood each other . " Where are you , Paul ? " I said , moving to kiss him . He avoided my lips . He turned his head to one side . " Do you dig this ? " I asked . " Me ? " he said . " But you know me , Karim . Try anything once . " " Ca n't you ... wo n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . When he came , it was , I swear , one of the great moments of my earlyish life . There was dancing in the streets . My flags flew , my trumpets blew ! Iwas licking my fingers and thinking of bloody shitter ! A shitter ! A bum-banger ! A shirt-lifter ! My own son ! How can it be ? " He jumped up and down as if he 'd just heard that the whole house had been burned to the ground . I did n't know what to do . So I started to imitate the voice he 'd used earlier with the advertisers and with Cheryl . " Relax , Dad . Relax your whole body from your fingers to your toes and send your mind to a quiet garden somewhere , where there are roses and sand castles ? " " I 'll send you to a fucking garden ! I 'll send you to a fucking doctor , you fucking shitter ! " He really was mad and he was at full volume . I had to stop him before we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , " I whispered . " You saw nothing ! " " I saw you . " Then I added significantly : " I saw everything . " " Do n't be so stupid . " But he looked at me with a shadow of worry in his face . " At least ... " I said . " At least what ? What ? " " At least . At least our mother has both breasts . " ? " What ? Oh yes . All right . I understand . I get you . " He went into the toilet without shutting the door and started to vomit . I went in behind him and rubbed his back as he threw up . " It 's all right , it 's all right , " I said as kindly as I could while he cried and heaved , heaved and cried , splattering his shoes and trousers , the floor and walls , with his turmoil . " I 'll never mention tonight again , " I said . " And neither will you . " He nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the toilet . " Why did you bring him home like this ? " said my mother , who stood behind us in her dressing gown . It was so long it almost touched the floor . It made her look square . " Could n't you have looked after him ? " She kept plucking at my arm . " I was looking out of the window and waiting for you for hours . " My father eventually stood up straight and pushed past us . " Make up a bed for me in the front room , " Mum said . " I ca n't sleep next to that man . " When I 'd made up the bed for her and she 'd got into it  --  and it was far too narrow and short for her  --  I told her something . I told her that whatever happened she was to understand one thing , one thing that I 'd decided . " What ? " she said . " I 'll never be getting married . O.K. ? " " I do n't blame you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't blame you at all . " a
