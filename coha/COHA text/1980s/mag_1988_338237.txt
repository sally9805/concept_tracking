Japanese officials are almost unfailingly circumspect . Then there is Seisuke Okuno , director-general of Japan 's National Land Agency . Last month Okuno provoked protests throughout Asia by declaring that his country " was by no means the aggressor nation " in World War II . On a recent visit to China , which suffered at Japan 's hands from 1931 to 1945 , Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno apologized for that remark . But last week Okuno was at it again , telling the Diet that Japan " had no intention of invading China . " <P> In South Korea , which was part of a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945 , the daily Kyunghyang Shinmun expressed outrage at Okuno 's " chauvinistic psychology . " China 's People 's Daily called for " effective measures " to counter Okuno 's message . After initially hesitating , Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on Friday demanded and received Okuno 's resignation .
