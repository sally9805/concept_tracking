A move is afoot in America to make English the official language not only of state and local governments but also of the nation , through an amendment to the United States Constitution. // Californians helped to ignite the movement when they voted 3 to 1 in November for Proposition 63 , a proposal to make English the state ' s official language. // // Heading the national drive are U.S. English , an organization formed three years ago by former US Sen. S.I. Hayakawa of California , and various state legislators. // Opposing the move are Hispanic groups concerned that the movement will stir up anti-Hispanic emotions , civil rights watchdog agencies such as the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , and organizations and state legislators who question the cultural value of such laws. // ' ' America agrees with us , ' ' says Steve Workings , a lobbyist for U.S. English . ' ' Let ' s make English our nation ' s official language . This idea is neither mean nor racist. ' ' // U.S. English will push for the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bikales , its executive director. // ' ' Calls for us to write model English-only legislation are coming from all over the country , ' ' says Ms. Bikales , speaking from the group ' s national office in Washington , D.C. // ' ' We definitely will increase our efforts to get a constitutional amendment making English our nation ' s official language , ' ' she says. // ' ' We oppose the movement , ' ' says Arturo Vargas , senior educational policy fellow of the National Council of La Raza , a national Hispanic organization formed in 1965 to help Hispanic immigrants adjust to life in the US. // ' ' On paper Prop. 63 is innocuous , ' ' Mr. Vargas says . ' ' Its effect is much deeper . It would eliminate all public use of any non-English language . The end result would be a community divided along ethnic lines . This offends me. ' ' // Proposition 63 poses a significant threat to civil rights and equal protection under the law for people who may speak a language other than English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ACLU. // ' ' We expect strong legal challenges to English-only in California , ' ' he says . ' ' And more problems could arise in Texas and Florida where there are large numbers of Spanish-speaking people . ' ' The whole one-language idea is a byproduct of the push for immigration reform , he says , and the ACLU will seek to be alert to any threat to the rights of the individual that it may cause. // This proposal is dangerous , Mr. Vargas says . It targets nonwhites , he says . ' ' I question the motives behind this type of legislation , ' ' he adds . ' ' It could eliminate all public use of non-English languages. ' ' // The success of future English-only legislation may depend on how California implements Proposition 63. // Supporters there want government in Sacramento to print no more bilingual ballots , to post no more bilingual traffic signs , and to reduce other bilingual services , which some contend are costly to taxpayers. // Also subject to the English-only drive would be such services as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing of such documents as drivers ' licenses and unemployment benefit forms. // Proposition 63 can not currently be made applicable nationwide . Federal voting-rights law requires that bilingual ballots be provided in elections in 197 counties - where the population is at least 10 percent Hispanic. // Pro-English politicians say Hispanics are spoon-fed extra services , but they failed last year in efforts to anglicize some activities . In Dade County ( Miami ) , Fla. the marriage bureau survived pressures to conduct weddings in English only . Los Altos , Calif. , refused to anglicize its name to The Heights. // National advertisers do not adhere to English only . They push their goods in Spanish-language media - on 300 television stations , on 200 radio stations , and in 200 newspapers . They are spending $300 million this year in TV commercials on Spanish-language outlets , reports The Economist , a British publication. // A typical state battle will be fought in Massachusetts . Heading the English-only forces is Republican state Rep. John H. Loring whose bill passed the state House of Representatives , but failed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proposition 63 in California , Mr. Loring says he has resubmitted his English-only bill for the next session in January . His bill , he says , simply states , ' ' The English language will be the official language of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. ' ' // ' ' This bill is for the good of the people who speak another language when they come to Massachusetts , ' ' he says. // ' ' Some people have the misconception that this is punitive , ' ' he adds . ' ' It doesn ' t mean everything ' s done in English . That ' s impossible . On the other hand , business , education , and all meaningful activities are conducted in English , but we have no laws. // ' ' Why not make English official ? This will encourage newcomers from other lands to learn our language for their own good. ' ' // Democratic state Sen. William Keating objects . He says : ' ' No constructive purpose can be served by passing such a law in Massachusetts . It can cause confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could play into people ' s fears. ' ' // Senator Keating , chairman of the Senate ' s steering and policy committee , opposed the 1986 bill . The Senate took no action. // The National Council of Teachers of English warned lawmakers and educators of what it termed the dangers of English-only in a resolution at its national convention Nov. 26 . The council pledged ' ' to oppose actively action intended to mandate or declare English as an official language or to ' preserve , ' ' purify , ' or ' enhance ' the language. ' ' // ' ' Personally , I ' d say this legislation is absurd on its face , ' ' said John C. Maxwell , executive director of the council . ' ' It has potentially harmful implications. ' ' // California is one of eight states with English as their official language. // Others are Nebraska , Illinois , Virginia , Indiana , Kentucky , Georgia , and Tennessee . At least 16 other states considered bills during 1986 , but none of them passed . More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says U.S. English ' s Mr. Workings. // One state , New Mexico , officially recognizes two languages , English and Spanish , as official. // //
