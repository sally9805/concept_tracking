txt head and the pull of the thread in the lower piece ? so there should be a clearance hole in the top piece . Make it just large enough for the screw to slide through ( Fig. 3-5A ) . This hole should go right through the top piece . If that is very thin , you may have to continue it a short way into the lower piece if the plain neck of the screw will project below , particularly if you are using a very hard wood . The size and depth of the hole in the lower piece depends on several things . A screw that will cut its own way into softwood may need a hole in hardwood . A small screw in softwood may be given a tap with a hammer , and it will then turn in with no other preparation . Other screws and other wood will need an undersize hole drilled to allow the threads to enter . Usually this tapping hole need not go the full depth in softwood ( Fig. 3-5B ) , but in a harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The work done to the mouth of the upper hole depends on the wood and the screw . In some softwoods a flat head screw will pull itself in flush , but in hardwoods a countersink bit is needed to prepare the hole ( Fig. 3-5C ) . It is best to try one screw first . If it does not pull in enough , withdraw it and countersink the hole . Screw holes are best made with the small twist drills primarily intended for metal . For the smallest sizes it is sufficient to push in an awl . If you want the narrow heads to be below the surface , do not just countersink excessively . That makes a wide tapered hole that will not hold stopping . Instead , counterbore the hole with a bit about the same size as the head , then drill the other holes in the usual way ( Fig. 3-5D ) . Stopping may be used above the head , in the same way as dealing with a nail , or there can be a wooden plug glued over the screw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thicker screws should have a better grip than thin screws of the same length . An examination of other assemblies , not necessarily toys , will provide a guide . BOLTS Bolts are needed in toys that have parts moving over each other and that are of more substantial sizes than can be held by clenched nails . A bolt may have any of the wood screw types of heads , or it can be shaped to turn with a wrench . Although the name bolt is loosely applied to all these fastenings , it is only partly threaded ( Fig. 3-6A ) . If the threads are taken to the head , it is more correctly called a metal-thread or machine screw ( Fig. 3-6B ) . For toys there are some thinner bolts with flatter curved heads . They may be stove bolts . A convenient type for use with wood is a carriage bolt , which has a square neck under the head to pull into and grip the wood so the bolt will not turn ( Fig. 3-6C ) . Nuts are shaped to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to move on each other , a single nut may work loose . This is prevented by using two nuts to form locknuts ( Fig. 3-6D ) . It is insufficient to merely tighten the top one onto the lower one . There should be a wrench on each nut , they are turned against each other to jam them . There are also nuts that include something to provide friction and prevent accidental loosening , so a second nut is unnecessary . A nut can be locked with epoxy adhesive . You can also hammer over the end of the bolt to prevent the nut from coming off . Wood rubbing on wood or the metal of a nut or bolt head pressing on wood will abrade away the wood surface . To reduce this , use washers whenever possible . A thin metal washer between parts will give smoother movement and reduce wear , while washers on each side will prevent the nut or bolt head from pulling in ( Fig. 3-6E ) . GLUES At one time some of the common glues were made from fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their way into youngster 's mouths , particularly as moisture would soften and melt these glues . In recent years nearly all glues have changed considerably , and they are now made with synthetic materials . Once set , in most cases there is nothing that will cause them to 21 Figure soften . Any of the available glues that set solidly and permanently should be safe to use for toys . Read the instructions with a particular glue as satisfactory results may only be obtainable in the way suggested . Always check the description of a particular glue . For maximum strength and suitability for constructional work in wood , the glue should be described as suitable for wood and nothing else . If a glue is described as suitable for paper , cardboard , cloth , and other things besides wood , it is probably a general-purpose adhesive strong enough for fancy goods and things with very light use . It is no use for load-bearing wooden constructions . Most glues supplied in one part depend on the evaporation of a solvent , which may be water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in contact until the glue has set , usually by light clamping . Warming the joint may speed setting , but do not heat excessively . This may damage some glue as well as distort the wood . Older craftsmen will remember the need for tight clamping with traditional glues , but modern glues are better with only just enough pressure to keep the surfaces in close contact . Excessive tightening may cause glue starvation by pressing most of the glue out of the joint . 22 For general work on toys there are several makes of white glue which are plastic-base and supplied usually in a semiflexible applicator bottle . These glues have good moisture resistance , but they will not stand up to really wet conditions . They should be suitable for most toys , except those intended for use outdoors or in water . The strongest and most waterproof glues are in two parts , with the glue itself accompanied by a hardener that causes it to set . There are several trade names . It is not always obvious what form a particular glue is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strong and fully waterproof , or nearly so . One two-part waterproof synthetic glue is urea formaldehyde , often called resin glue . There is a resin of a thick consistency or a powder to mix with water to make a resin of thick consistency . With it is a hardener , which is a mild acid . In some of these glues the hardener is added to the glue just before it is applied . In another type the hardener is put on one surface and the glue on the other . Setting starts when they meet . Another type has a dry powder hardener mixed with the powder resin . Setting commences after water is added , and there is a limited time for use . Any excess mixture will harden in the pot . Another two-part glue is resorcinol . It has a reddish color and is often used in plywood . It is not really a glue to choose for toys . The strongest and most waterproof glue is epoxy . It is more expensive and not necessary in toymaking , except it is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including metals to themselves or to wood . The strength of most modern glues builds up progressively . The instructions may quote clamping times . After that clamps can be removed and work done on the assembly , but the glue may not gain its full strength for several days . Some glues cause discoloration of the wood if they are in contact with metals . This may not matter with a painted toy , but the glues should not be mixed in metal containers or brushes used with metal bindings . For the glue areas likely to be covered in toys , the glue can be spread with a piece of wood . Screws or nails in contact with the glue may cause staining . If you want to put melamine laminated plastic on wood to make a water-resistant hard working surface , it has to be attached with contact adhesive . This is unsuitable for wood to wood joints , but it is particularly suitable for one type of plastic . Usually both surfaces are coated and left to almost dry . The plastic sheet is then sprung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct position , then pressed down . Once the surfaces have met , the parts can not be repositioned . They have to be right the first time . STOPPINGS Materials used to fill cracks and holes in wood are collectively called stoppings . They are mostly puttylike pastes that can be squeezed from a tube or used with a knife from a can . Their purpose is to fill spaces . They do not provide strength like glue . Most will set quickly without expanding or contracting . It is normal to let them stand slightly above the surface and sand them level after they have hardened . Stoppings colored to match the wood are available . Some are waterproof , but that will not be an important consideration for most toys . If the wood is to be stained , the chosen stopping should be one that will take stain and finish the same color as the wood . It should be of the final color and applied after staining . If the toy is to be painted , the color of the stopping does not matter . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations where the wood may be expected to expand and contract . These stoppings never completely harden and will always be sufficiently flexible to allow for slight wood movements . Use the rigid stoppings for nearly all toys , but the flexible stoppings may have uses in toys that are to remain outdoors in wet weather . Nearly all glues require the surfaces to be in close contact . They are not gap filling , so a poor open joint will not be successfully glued . If parts do not meet as they should , or there are holes or cracks to be filled where some strength is welcome , ordinary stopping will not do . The alternative is to mix sawdust with glue to a thick paste , which can be pressed into a space with a little excess left standing . Leave this to harden and sand level . Most untreated glues will craze if put into an open space ? they set with minute cracks that weaken the glue considerably . By mixing in sawdust , the glue is given more small particles of wood to adhere to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused with fillers . Some woods have very open grain , so spaces in the grain pattern on a surface can be clearly seen . Fillers are used all over such a surface to close these small spaces and present a level surface for polishing or other finish . For a painted or varnished wood toy , there should be no need for a filler first . The finishing material will serve as its own filler . 24 Chapter 4 Tools and Techniques Most toys can be made with few tools and little woodworking skill . Obviously there is an advantage in having a variety of tools and the skill to use them , but for the simpler things there is no need for a special shop . The work can be done on a strong table . This is not a book on more advanced woodworking techniques , but for anyone who wants to take up woodworking seriously see my book , The Woodworker 's Bible ( TAB Book No. 860 ) . This chapter is more concerned with ideas that may help a beginner to produce wooden toys more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , so you must also have the means of sharpening them . For general planing a good choice is a Stanley number 4 steel plane . If you buy wood machine-planed , this tool will do all of the hand planing you are likely to need . There will have to be one or two chisels ; ' - inch and 1-inch bevel-edged ones are useful . A good knife also has uses . It may be a type with disposable blades or one with a permanent blade . Other useful cutting tools are those that work with a file action such as the Surform , with disposable blades , which may be flat or curved . They can not be sharpened and are replaced when blunted . Woodworking tools may have to be ground , and that requires a rotating grinding wheel . Grinding is a comparatively rare need , and you may get tools ground elsewhere . There is a more frequent need to hone them , and this is done on an oilstone . A useful size is about 2 25 inches by 8 inches by 1 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need a coarse surface for the rapid removal of metal , as when you have to eliminate a notch caused by hitting a nail . That does not leave a very good edge , so there also has to be a fine surface for finishing . A convenient buy is a double-sided stone . Otherwise , you need two stones , although it is possible to use a medium one . Use a thin oil . Thick oil prevents the grit in the stone cutting . Do not use a dry stone , as that rapidly wears away the surface . Light lubricating oil is suitable , or you can use kerosene . Chisels and plane cutters usually have two bevels ( Fig. 4-1A ) , although thinner ones may have single bevels . The long bevel is produced by grinding . The other is made by rubbing on the oilstone . This means that the " sharpening " bevel gets longer until there has to be a renewal of the " grinding " bevel to bring the sharpening bevel back to a reasonable narrow size . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sharpening can be done on the oilstone unless the edge gets uneven or damaged . Hold the tool so the sharpening bevel is flat on the stone ( Fig. 4-1B ) , with one hand on the handle to provide control and the fingers of the other hand spread just above the cutting edge to provide pressure . Keep the same angle as you rub the tool over the stone . To keep wear on the stone even , move the tool about ( Fig. 4-1C ) . Continue until you appear to have rubbed a thin edge . Wipe off the oil and stroke a finger towards the edge on the other side . If the edge is sharp , there should be a burr or wire edge there ( Fig. 4-1D ) . This is a particle of steel rubbed from the tool but still clinging to the edge . Put the blade flat on the stone and rub it with a circular motion ( Fig. 4-1E ) to remove the wire edge . To make sure the wire edge has gone , slice the tool diagonally across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a coarse stone , go through this complete sequence on it , wipe the blade clean , and then repeat the actions on a finer stone . You will not have to do this for long , as all you are doing is removing the marks made by the coarse stone . A knife edge is restored in a similar way , but sharpening has to be done from both sides . Use one hand to control and the other to provide pressure . Tilt the blade on the stone so the edge is in contact , and rub one side until there appears to be a good bevel to the edge . Turn the blade over , and do the same on the other side . Wipe the steel . If the two bevels meet , there will be a wire edge on the side that was uppermost . If there is not , continue sharpening on both sides , then remove the wire edge by slicing across scrap wood . 26 It is often possible to see bluntness . Hold the tool edge upwards with a light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it reflects light . This check is useful with a curved knife edge , as it will show parts needing further attention . SAWING AND PLANING A vise is useful for holding wood being worked on , but another useful tool to make is a bench hook . It is just a flat piece of wood with strips nailed or screwed across ( Fig. 4-2A ) . You can hook it over the edge of a bench or table and push wood against it , particularly for sawing ( Fig. 4-2B ) . Abacksaw about 10 inches long will make most cuts in small toys . It is also possible to hold smaller pieces of wood against the bench hook for planing . For longer pieces you need a bench stop , which can be a piece of wood nailed temporarily to the bench top ( Fig. 4-2C ) . Use two hands on the plane and stand so you are pushing it , not swinging it across in front of you . 27 The plane blade ? often called an iron although it is made of steel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 4-2D ) . Adjust that fairly close to the edge , certainly no more than 1/16 inch from it . Adjust the cutting edge so it only projects just enough to cut . If you try to take off too much with each cut , the plane will jump and the surface will be poor . If the surface tears up , turn the wood around and plane the other way . 28 There is not much difficulty in using a chisel , but consider safety . Never cut toward your body or hand . Have the wood held down in a vise or with a clamp . Use two hands on the chisel . One hand is for control , while the other hand directs and is ready to restrict if the cut begins to go too far . If you are paring with a chisel , move it sideways and forward to get a slicing action . This is particularly important if you are cutting across the grain ( Fig. 4-2E ) . There are many toys that include round rods . You may use prepared dowel rods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as satisfactory to use octagonal pieces made by planing the corners off square strips . A trough is needed to hold the pieces while planing . It can be simply made by planing angles off two strips . Nail or screw them together and make a notch for a stop to fit in ( Fig. 4-2F ) . Otherwise , make it shallow to go on top of the bench against the bench top . DRILLING Small holes for screws and similar things can be made with metalworking twist drills , but they leave ragged edges . For holes over about V4 inch , use proper woodworking drills , either the type for use in an electric drill or those intended for a hand brace . If a hole is to be drilled right through , always have a piece of scrap wood tightly against the far side to prevent grain from breaking out ( Fig. 4-3A ) . Even better , only drill until the point breaks through , then drill back from the other side ( Fig. 4-3B ) . The second method is more easily applied when using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a series of holes ought to be at the same depth . If you use an electric drill in a stand , there should be a depth control . For hand use there are depth stops available to attach to the bit . A simple stop is a piece of drilled wood on the bit ( Fig. 4-3C ) . To sharpen a woodworking drill bit , use a fine small file . If it is a bit with a rotating spur to cut the outline of the hole , only sharpen on its inside , or you will alter the size of the hole and may cause the chip-removing blade to go outside the spur . CURVES Many toys have shaped outlines . An electric jigsaw is a useful tool , but there are handsaws that will do the same work . A coping saw ( Fig.4-4A ) has a disposable blade about ' inch wide , and it will follow curves in softwood up to about % inch thick . There are two ways of using the saw . You can either cut on the push or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is held upright in a vise ( Fig. 4-4B ) . The blade is put into the frame so the teeth point away from the handle . Both hands grip the handle . Use most of the length of the blade and keep it moving , particularly when turning corners . Cutting toward the handle gives better control over fine details . Notch the end of a piece of wood to act as a sawing board ( Fig. 4-4C ) . Have the teeth pointing towards the handle . Sit so you can hold the handle with one hand and steady the wood with the other ( Fig. 4-4D ) . For an internal cut , drill a hole in the waste part and thread the blade through ( Fig. 4-4E ) . A coping saw leaves a rather ragged surface which has to be sanded or otherwise smoothed . Afretsaw works in the same way , but the blade is much finer . Some blades are so fine that the only way to test the direction of the teeth is to feel them . For most work there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades are not very strong , and you will probably break several of them . The edge left by a fretsaw should not need any other treatment . There are powered fretsaws which work accurately . They are the tools to use if you want to make jigsaw puzzles from pictures stuck to plywood . If you have to use a plane or chisel on a curved edge , look at the grain direction . If you think of the grain parts as a bundle of straws and you are to make a sloping cut across them , trying to cut toward them will make the straws bend . Slicing in their direction will pare them off . Make cuts with the grain whether the curve is concave 30 31 ( Fig. 4-4F ) or convex ( Fig. 4-4G ) . This applies whether you are using a tool with a single cutting edge or a file type such as a Surform tool or a rasp . If you use a knife to whittle a curved shape , consider the direction of grain but also be careful . It is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either damage the work or yourself . Never cut toward your body , and never have one hand ahead of the knife while cutting with the other . It is better to have the wood held by a vise or clamp . Treat the knife in a way similar to a chisel , with one hand on the handle and the other pressing the blade . Both hands are ready to restrict if the cut starts going too far . Shaped work may have to be finished by sanding . Modem abrasives are mostly manufactured , and the older natural grits are not used much . Grading systems tend to vary , so it is probably better to talk about fine , medium , and coarse and leave the supplier to select what is appropriate . If you have to sand a flat surface , wrap the abrasive paper around a flat block of wood . Using a piece freehand is less effective and more wasteful of paper . On curves a strip of abrasive paper pulled backwards and forwards will take out tool marks and produce even shapes . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be given a clear finish , complete sanding by rubbing with the grain to remove the crossing scratches . For most toy finishes it will probably be sufficient to use medium abrasive paper , but you can get a very smooth finish by working down through finer grades . MARKING OUT You may feel that for many toys there is no need for a great degree of accuracy . That may be so , but if you make a cut that should be square and is not , or something that should be parallel is not , the faults will be very obvious to all ? even the child . Check straightness with a straightedge , which may be a rule or simply a piece of wood . Close one eye , look along an edge , and you can soon detect a hollow or round . Check squareness from a straightedge . The tool you should have is a try square ( Fig. 4-5A ) . It can test an end already cut or be used with a knife or pencil to mark while being held tight to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a try square , you may manage with a set square ( Fig. 4-5C ) . There are other things that should be square and may be used for squaring . The corner of a sheet of plywood should be true , and you can make a set square from that . Even the corner of a magazine page should be true and can be used for 32 checking . You will not get very far in woodworking without a try square , though . If parts have to match , mark them out together as far as possible . Suppose there have to be four matching legs . Put the pieces of wood together and mark across them all ( Fig. 4-5D ) . Where there have to be saw cuts , you will get a cleaner edge by severing the grain fibers with a knife . If all the marks are for is to locate a hole , then use a pencil . Be careful not to put knife scratches across a face that will be exposed in the finished work . If you have to make lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marking gauge , but that is not an easy device for a beginner to handle . If you have to mark the same distance many times from an edge , it helps to notch a scrap of wood and use it with a pencil ( Fig. 33 Figure 4-5E ) . If you have to get an exact position for a hole , always mark its center with crossing lines . It will help to push an awl in at the crossing to give the drill a start ( Fig. 4-5F ) . JOINTS For much toy construction it will be sufficient to let pieces of wood overlap . Join them with glue , nails , or screws as already described . There will rarely need to be joints of the types used by cabinetmakers , but two worth knowing about are halved or notched joints and doweled joints . If two strips have to cross at the same level , half must be cut from each piece ( Fig. 4-6A ) . This also applies when they do not , come at the same level . Notches may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notches are also good ways of positively locating another part . Crossings do not have to be at right angles . In the basic halving joint , mark each piece from the actual size of the other with knife cuts . Then gauge or mark the depths of the cuts ( Fig. 4-6B ) . Hold the wood in a vise or against the bench hook , and saw on the waste sides of the lines ( Fig. 4-6C ) . If you saw on the lines , the notches will finish too wide . 34 Remove the waste with a chisel , but first cut from each side , sloping upwards to the . center ( Fig. 4-6D ) , before paring straight across ( Fig. 4-6E ) . Check flatness across ; it is better to be slightly hollow than rounded at the center . Dowels have taken the place of traditional mortise and tenon joints and other constructions particularly in industry , where they are more suited to quantity production . In making individual things , dowels are easier to use and produce satisfactory results . Dowel rods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This makes them suitable for other things besides joints . It is worthwhile to build up a stock of dowel rods in many sizes . It is also possible to get short dowels already prepared for making joints , but for most toys it is better to cut your own from rods . Joints are usually made with at least two dowels ( Fig. 4-7A ) . A single dowel might allow for twisting . If there are more , the parts are definitely located in relation to each other . That means you have to get them right , or one part may not be exactly in the correct position , and you ca n't do much about it . Accurate marking out and drilling are important . There are doweling jigs that are useful for anyone making a large number of joints in furniture , but for toymaking you can rely on marking out . In the joint shown , square the end of one piece , but 35 there can be a little extra left on the other piece to clean off later ( Fig. 4-7B ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the front surface . Put them together and square across the dowel positions ( Fig. 4-7C ) . Dowel diameters are usually slightly more than half the thickness of the wood , but you have to choose sizes to suit available dowel rods . The distance the dowels go in is not critical , but somewhere between two and four times the diameter will do . It is important to get the holes drilled squarely with the surfaces . If you have an electric drill mounted in a stand , that should take care of squareness . Otherwise , have the wood in a vise . As you drill , look over to see that the drill is held squarely in that direction . Have an assistant looking in a direction at right angles to your view , so he can check that the drill is true . It does not matter if the holes are deeper than the dowel is to go , as that will allow some air space and prevent the bursting tendency that may be present if the entering dowel compressed air and glue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pare the ends slightly ( Fig. 4-7D ) . Use a saw lengthwise to make a shallow groove ( Fig. 4-7E ) . This allows air and surplus glue to escape as the dowel is driven in . Make a joint completely in one operation . It is unsatisfactory to glue the dowels in one part and let the glue set there before introducing the dowels to the other holes . The joint can be taken tight so surplus glue oozes out , indicating that you have a close fit right through . If the item you are making has several dowel joints , prepare and make all of them at one working period . Otherwise , you may not get the assembly properly squared up . As a final check on this or any other jointed assembly , inspect it for flatness . Sight across opposite sides . If there is an obvious twist , it should be possible to force the parts true while the glue is still liquid . Leave the assembly under weights for the glue to set if you have to correct a twist . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wipe off any surplus with a damp cloth after it has partly set . With many glues it is better to let them set , then use a chisel to chip off any glue that has oozed from a joint . 36 Chapter 5 Simple Toys It may seem easy to provide a child with plenty of wood blocks for building homes , walls , forts , and other structures , and for use as loads in trucks and boats . There are a few points to consider , though ( Fig. 5-1 ) . BUILDING BLOCKS The blocks should be made of a close-grained hardwood that is unlikely to splinter in use . Corners should be rounded . For most purposes the faces of the blocks should be squared properly , although there may be used for triangular and other shapes . Make sure that blocks for a young child are not too small . The child must be able to handle them , but he or she can not deal effectively with things that are tiny . Many things a child handles will find their way to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a problem , and a boy or girl at the stage of playing with models may prefer plenty of smaller bricks so walls , roads , and buildings more nearly in proportion to the models can be assembled . It may seem like a good idea to provide a miscellaneous collection of blocks of many shapes and sizes , so the child can build whatever suits his or her fancy . He or she will actually do better with some standard size pieces . The child will build something more satisfying with perhaps 20 blocks all the same size than he or she can with 20 which are all different . There can be some blocks in odd sizes which have been created by using up off cuts of wood from 37 Figure other projects . The basis of a collection of building blocks should be pieces that conform to standard sizes . Adopt a unit and let all the dimensions be multiples of that unit . It will then be possible to put the blocks together systematically . For some blocks it may be best to halve the unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole units . For the youngest child attempting his or her first building with blocks , it is best to keep to cubes . With the dimensions the same all ways , it does not matter how blocks are put together . Other blocks are better if they are 1 by 1 by 2 units or 1 by 2 by 3 units ( Fig. 5-2A ) . Prepare strips to the section you want ( Fig. 5-2B ) . If you have a table saw ? even a small one ? the blocks can be carefully squared to size using a slide and the fence ( Fig. 5-2C ) . If you have to cut by hand , carefully square around the wood with a pencil and a try square ( Fig. 5-2D ) . In both cases allow a little extra for the thickness of the saw cut , particularly if you are making cubes . Otherwise , a block turned on end may not match one the right way . Use a fine backsaw for hand cutting . Watch the lines on two surfaces as you cut ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactorily , although it can be done with a sharp finely set plane while the wood is held with the minimum amount extending above the jaws of a vise . It is safer to rely on sanding . With a powered belt sander , the sawed ends can be quickly smoothed ( Fig. 5-2F ) . For hand leveling , have a sheet of fairly coarse abrasive paper on a flat surface and rub the wood in 38 circles on it ( Fig. 5-2G ) . Follow with a finer abrasive on the end grain and the other surfaces . Use folded abrasive paper in your hand to round the edges and corners slightly . Triangular blocks are most used if their apexes are right angles ( Fig. 5-2H ) . Let the thickness be one or more units . Have an exact 39 number of units along the short sides of the base . Avoid triangles with little height and rather acute and sharp angles at each end of the base ; they might harm a child . Semicircular blocks can also be included ( Fig. 5-2J ) . Round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one unit upwards , so pillars and chimneys can be made . With all of these shapes , make sure that flat surfaces are true . If a part will not stand or only does so at a slope , it can not perform satisfactorily in an assembly . If building blocks are frequently used , as you hope they will be , they will get rough treatment . It is of little use trying to put a high finish on them . It may be better to use colored stains of the types sometimes sold as wood dyes , in bright colors as well as wood shades . If paint is used , the end grain should be treated with filler . Otherwise , much of the paint will soak in , even after many coats . It is possible to buy decals of individual letters . These can be put on the faces of cubes , so a child can put them together to form words . They may not last long if untreated . It is advisable to paint the cubes , then apply the decals . Allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them one or two coats of varnish . Other decals of flowers or nursery rhyme scenes could be used in a similar way . A final project can be a box for the blocks . It may be large enough to take the blocks tossed in haphazardly . For a simple set of standard sizes , you can arrange them in a pattern that just fits the box , while not being too difficult for the child to treat as a puzzle . DOLL 'S PLAYPEN This toy will keep dolls and their things together . It folds flat and can be stored in a small space . The young owner can then regard it as something like its full-size counterpart . Mother may regard it as a way of keeping some of the child 's toys together . As shown in Fig. 5-3 , two opposite sides fold inwards to go between the other two for packing . A bottom that folds in half will fit between the opened framework and keep it in shape ( Fig. 5-4 ) . The framework can be used either way up , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing the playpen . The sizes given will make a playpen suitable for most purposes . If sizes are altered , take care that the folding sides are a suitable size to fit between the rigid sides . If their overall length is the same as the rigid sides , the fact that they overlap at the corners makes them short enough to have clearance at the center when folded . Making all four sides the same simplifies setting out and construction . 40 Mark out all the top and bottom rails as if they were all to be rigid ( Fig. 5-5A ) . The half sides can be cut across the middle later ( Fig. 5-5B ) . Cut the rails to length and drill for the dowel rods ( Fig. 5-5C ) . If possible , use a depth gauge on the drill to get all the holes the same depth . Check the size of the hole against the dowel rod by drilling scrap wood first . The joint should be a push fit . It is better to reduce the ends of the rods slightly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glue alone will not fill spaces and form a rigid construction . Cut all the rods at the same time and to the same lengths . Assemble all four sides . Glue the dowels in place . Check squareness and be sure the overall depths are the same . If one framework is assembled satisfactorily , the others can be checked by assembling over it . Let the glue set before continuing . 41 Mark the centers of the two frames to be cut . See that they are the same . Cut them and round the outer corners . Sand all edges and corners , so there are no ragged parts or sharp angles left . Metal hinges will be too large and clumsy . It is better to use fabric . Canvas-backed plastic of the leathercloth type is suitable . Cut pieces about 1% inches long and slightly narrower than the wood rails . Take off the corners . Use fine nails with flat heads . Gimp pins intended for upholstery are suitable . Smear glue under the fabric as well . Three nails in each position should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close to the angle of the " hinge " as possible . If driven slightly diagonally back into the wood , there will be little risk of splitting . Get the size of the bottom ( Fig. 5-5E ) by measuring inside the assembled framework . Allow an easy fit . If necessary , cut away the corners to clear the hinges . Glue and nail the stiffening pieces underneath . Hinge the two parts with more of the fabric used at the pen corners . The finished playpen and its bottom can be painted in bright colors . If a suitable hardwood has been used , it may be better varnished . Figure 42 DOLL 'S ROCKING CRIB This model crib is based on a pioneer design . The example is about 24 inches long , but sizes can be easily adapted to suit a doll of 43 any size . When an allowance is made for bedding , anything much smaller ceases to be practical . Sides and ends flare outwards to give a pleasing and authentic appearance . This gives a compound angle at the corners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correct angle of cuts , but the flare is so slight that the grooves can be cut as if there was no flare . The crib ( Fig. 5-6 ) is made of solid wood , with plywood top and bottom , using dado joints at the corners . A close-grained hardwood is best . The rockers have slight curves , so there is little fear of the young owner turning the crib over . She can sit back and rock her doll with one foot in the traditional way . The best sequence of work is to make the head and foot first , then use these to get the sizes of the sides . Mark out the head ( Fig. 5-7A ) first . Give it 1 inch of flare on each side . Use the scale on the drawing to obtain sizes . The angle to plane the bottom edge is 15 degrees . Use the head as a template to mark the foot ( Fig. 5-7B ) , which must have the same angles at the sides and bottom . Round the top of the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head square across to take the plywood top . On the wood for a side , set out the shape ( Fig. 5-8A ) . Allow a 15-degree slope at each end , with grooves marked to take head and 44 45 foot . The upper part at the head is at 90 degrees to the end . Allow for the part that will support the top , then draw a freehand curve for the shaped edge . Cut this out and mark the other side as a pair to it . The slope of an end 's side can be used to set an adjustable bevel for testing the bottom edges when they are planed . Cut the shallow trenches for the dado joints ( Fig. 5-8B ) . Drill for screws ? three at each foot joint and five at each head joint should suit most woods . To get a good hold in end grain , use 46 1 ? - inch by 6- or 8-gauge screws . Assemble the four parts with glue and screws . Let the glue set before continuing . Plane the lower edges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While doing this , check squareness of the assembly when viewed from above . Round the edges that will be exposed to a child 's hands . The top is a piece of plywood sprung to a curve ( Fig. 5-8C ) . Round the front edge , both in plan view and in cross section , but leave the other edges slightly oversize to be trimmed after fitting . That will give you something to press on . Allow for correction if you get the plywood located slightly out of true . It is possible to bend and nail flexible plywood , but small screws will pull and hold the plywood to a curve better . Use glue as well . Trim and round the other edges when the top is securely in place . The rockers ( Fig. 5 - 7C ) have flat tops , but get the curve for the bottoms by springing a lath and drawing with a pencil around it ( Fig. 5-8D ) . Cut the curve on one rocker . Sight around it to see that it follows a smooth shape , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends and all exposed edges . Attach the rockers a short distance in from the ends by screwing through the bottom from inside . Traditional cribs of this type were given a natural finish or left bare , probably because the pioneers did not have paint to spare . The paint they had contained lead , which could be dangerous to a child . This toy crib may be finished in bright colors , although it looks best with a light color on inner surfaces and any color that appeals to you on outer surfaces . DOLL 'S CRIB This is one of the simplest cribs ( Fig. 5-9 ) . All of the parts can be plywood . If suitable pieces of solid wood can be obtained , the finished crib will look better . Construction will be slightly simpler . Set out the shape of the head ( Fig. 5-10A ) . The heart-shaped cutout is not just decoration . It is intended to admit two fingers for lifting the crib . Mark out the foot from the head , but cut it down to size ( Fig. 5-10B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilled . The 47 shapes are completed with a jigsaw or a coping saw ( Fig. 5-10C ) . See that head and foot match . Mark on them where the sides will come . 48 Make the sides ( Fig. 5-10D ) . Top edges do not have to be cut out , but that improves appearance and accessibility . Cut the ends of the sides squarely , so they butt against the head and foot closely . On all four parts , round the exposed edges where the child 's hands may come . Put strips to support the bottom inside the lower edges of the sides ( Fig. 5-10E ) , but do not put strips across the ends yet . Drill for 49 screws through the ends . Four 2-inch by 6 screws at each joint should be strong enough in end grain . If you have used a closegrained hardwood , 1Yz-inch screws might be long enough . See that the crib stands level . Put strips across the ends to support the bottom , keeping their tops level with the side strips ( Fig. 5-10F @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the supporting strips with a few small nails and glue . Give the wood a final inspection for sharp or rough edges , then finish the whole crib with paint . The head and foot could be a different color from the sides , and there can be decals on the ends if you wish . Figure ROCKER This toy allows two youngsters to rock with a seesaw action , either indoors or out , but with little risk of falling out or being harmed . Stops at the ends limit the amount of rocking . Construction should be mainly of ' /z-inch plywood , which should be exterior or marine grade if the toy is to be used regularly outdoors ( Fig. 5-11 ) . If solid wood is used , it should be slightly thicker . Using plywood allows the whole toy to be quite light and easily lifted by an adult . The key part is a side . Set out one side first , with all the other parts marked on it ( Fig. 5-12A ) . The curve should be part of a circle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by springing a batten , which may not be the same . Improvise a compass with a piece of wood and a nail or awl as center . See that the center is on a line square with the edge of the rocker side ( Fig.5-12B ) . This can be checked with an experimental swing to the ends . The curve should cut both ends at the same distance from an edge . If it does not , manipulate the wood so it does before drawing the curve . The stops ( Fig. 5-12C ) need not project much , but they should all be the same and to smooth curves . Cut the two sides together and mark the second one as a pair to the first . Round all edges in cross section . When making the crosswise members , check them against each other to see that they are all the same length . Shape the tops of 50 the seat backs , but otherwise all edges are straight . Round the edges that are away from supports . For the best finish , round all exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail or screw the battens in position on the sides . Then fit the footrest , seats , and seat backs . Check squareness 51 across . Have the assembly upside down and see that it will rest squarely . When you sight across the curves , make sure they match . If there is any twist , correct it before the glue has started to set . Mark the handrail side pieces and make them with all exposed edges rounded ( Fig. 5-12E ) . It may be possible to fit the handrails into holes that do not go right through ( Fig. 5-12F ) . It may be better to take the rods through ( Fig. 5-12G ) , either with the ends level or allowed to project slightly and be rounded . Rubber could be stuck around the curved edge . Finish the rocker by painting in bright colors . FORT If a boy has toy soldiers , a fort provides a place to use them . It may serve as a medieval castle , a frontier fort , or a modern bar-racks . This fort ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use as a parade ground or an assembly place for vehicles or horse troops . There are towers where sentries can stand on duty and a ramp for vehicles or horses to enter or leave . Most of the construction is Y4-inch plywood frame around with strips about % - inch square glued and nailed on . This gives a light and strong construction . The overall sizes ( Fig. 5-14 ) can be varied to suit available materials . Start by making the floor ( Fig. 5-15A ) . This is framed around , but leave off the piece that will join on the ramp ( Fig. 5-15B ) until later . The castellations on the top edges around the sides are based on widths of 1 inch and depths of 3/a inch . For the sake of appearance , they should be cut evenly . It will help in marking out if a card template is made ( Fig. 5-16A ) . The back and front match the length of the floor , and the ends overlap them . Make the back to go right across , but cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Both ends are the same except for the extension on the one that supports the top of the ramp ( Fig. 5-15D ) . Glue and nail the back , 52 front , and ends to the floor . Put short framing pieces in the corners below the floor . Make up the inside pieces for the towers ( Fig. 5-16B ) and assemble them to the main parts . Framing strips should be high 53 enough to support squares that will provide platforms for soldiers to stand on ( Fig. 5-16C ) . Draw a line to mark the slope of the ramp on the front ( Fig. 5-15E ) . Use this as a guide to the angle to plane the framing piece where the ramp will join the projecting floor . Put a supporting strip for the ramp on the front . Make matching pieces for the approach front to stand up as a 3/4-inch wall ( Fig. 5-16D ) . Fit the sloping piece to complete the assembly . You can make doors to the space below or a hatch in the floor to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to its painting . Externally , you can draw the outlines of stones . 54 55 // This is an educational toy ( Fig. 5-17 ) for the youngest child who is just learning to reason and sort things out . There are three each of four shapes which can be put over pegs , either sorted into 57 Figure one pattern on each peg or arranged into similar piles . Offcuts of wood can be used , but the shapes should be made of plywood to avoid splitting . They should be light enough to handle , but not so small or thin that a child can easily put them in his or her mouth . The shapes ( Fig. 5-17A ) are based on a 2 ? - inch square . Drill the holes to give a very easy clearance . If the dowel rods are / inch 58 in diameter , the holes could be 3/4 inch . Round all edges and take the sharpness off the angular corners . Round the tops of the dowels ( Fig. 5-17B ) and the corners of the base . Drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are altered , the distances between the pegs should be enough for two squares to clear each other when set diagonally . It may be sufficient to glue the dowels into holes that are a good fit , but for security glue wedges into saw cuts ( Fig. 5-17C ) . Finish with bright colors . Use a different color for each shape and another color for the stand . JIGSAW PUZZLES Jigsaw puzzles were first called " dissected puzzles " when they became popular in the eighteenth century . They were intended as teaching aids , particularly for history and geography , with historical scenes or maps appearing as the parts were assembled . They developed into adult puzzles cut in mahogany or other quality wood . They were kept in wooden boxes . Modern puzzles are intended more as tests of skill in assembling large numbers of parts , and those commercially available are usually pressed out of card . Jigsaw puzzles made in the old-fashioned way with the picture stuck to plywood are fine whether the result is an educational scene or just a picture that appeals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the parts large and com paratively few . If you are using /-inch plywood , no part should be much less than 2 inches across ( Fig. 5-18A ) . The overall size will depend on the picture , but 10 inches square is reasonable . That divides into 25 parts . If that seems too many for a child , make the cuts further apart ? 2 ? - inch spacing makes 16 parts . Plane the edges after gluing on the picture . Use a fairly fine fretsaw and do not force it too hard . In that way edges will be left smooth enough not to need any further treatment . You can probably cut across freehand . There is no need for precision , but you have to keep the general spacing fairly even . It may help to put paint guidelines across with a soft pencil ( Fig. 5-18C ) . A young child may have difficulty in deciding on overall'sizes . You can make a frame in which to assemble the puzzle ( Fig. 5-18D ) . 59 If you obtain several pictures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . PUPPET THEATER If a child has glove puppets , he wants a place to display them in a performance . The child needs a stage , preferably one large enough for a second child to sit with him or her and use more puppets . Parents obviously do not want anything bulky that will be in the way when out of use . This arrangement ( Fig. 5-19 ) will fold flat , but it opens to hide the operator(s) and only show the performers . The height will have to suit the child . A stage just above table height can be arranged by making the total height 48 inches ? the standard width of a sheet of plywood or hardboard . Cut the panels for the front and both sides . Cut the stage opening , but leave trimming it exactly to size until after framing . Edges can be brought level with the strips . Frame them all round with strips glued and nailed on . It will help the theater to stand on uneven ground if feet are added ( Fig. 5-19A ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a stage ( Fig. 5-19B ) . 60 It will probably be best if the child sits on a stool low enough for his or her head to come below stage level . There can be ledges to take a loose board as a seat or something to lean against ( Fig. 5-19D ) . 61 This toy can be decorated by painting . The opening might be made into an impressiveproscenium with canopy and pillars painted around it . Curtains can be hung to draw across . Scenery may be hung from rods across the top , so the puppets perform in front of it . Cloth or paper scenery or strips of wood will be kept by the operator and changed while the curtains are drawn across . Notches in the top framing will locate the strips ( Fig. 5-19E ) . TRESTLE ROCKING HORSE Some traditional rocking horses were produced in very lifelike forms . Youngsters may have got just as much satisfaction out of using a more basic rocking horse , while their imagination took care of what was lacking in design and appearance . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several generations in a stately European home . A much simpler and more easily made rocking horse is described here . If it gets rough treatment and does not survive more than one or two children , it will have served its purpose . This rocking horse is basically a trestle mounted on rockers and given a head and tail to provide some semblance of reality ( Fig. 5-20 ) . If sizes are altered , maintain a good spread to the rockers so the risk of tipping sideways is minimal . Let the rockers project far enough ahead and behind so normal use does not tend to roll the horse too far . Figure 5-21 shows suggested sizes . Make a full-size drawing of at least the body with the legs and rockers in side and end view . This allows for checking of sizes and angles . Although the legs are raked in both directions , you can use squared strips with no need for special section angles . Plane the wood for the body . Use the end view as a guide to angles . Bevel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5-22A ) . Taper the pieces for the legs ( Fig. 5-22B ) . They can be overlong at this stage . Check that they are all the same . 62 Make the two rockers ( Fig.5-22C ) . Test the accuracy of the curves by turning one on the other . Plane the lower edges parallel with the floor , but round the edges to reduce any tendency to mark carpets . Mark where the legs will come on the body and rockers . Keep the bottoms of the legs a short distance above the curved edges . The tops of the legs can overlap the top surface of the body and be trimmed after assembly . Join these parts with glue and screws . The plywood top can be left parallel , but it is better to hollow it slightly where the child 's legs will come ( Fig. 5-22D ) . Cut a slot for the head to match that on the body . Round the corners and the edges . A smoothly sanded outline looks good and makes for comfort . Attach the top to the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown across the rockers ( Fig. 5-22E ) . This may also serve as a footrest if the child 's legs are long enough , but another footrest is shown on the front legs ( Fig. 5-22F ) . This will have to be positioned to suit the child and may have to be moved after he has grown . The step is worth having even if the child 's legs are short . It 63 64 is a help when climbing on the horse . Round the ends of both piece and round the parts where feet will come . The exposed angles of th horse 's legs may also be rounded between parts that are attached t , them . The head gives character to the horse and can be given just token shape , but it is better to cut it with a recognizable outline Then use paint to make it more lifelike . A possible outline is show on a grid of squares ( Fig. 5-23 ) . If two pieces of plywood are used ti make up the thickness , cut one piece to shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . Leave the part that fits into th slot with square edges , but round all other edges . 6E 66 The handle is a piece of dowel or other round rod . Round its ends . Be careful when drilling the head for the handle to get it true . If the handle does not fit squarely , any error will be very obvious . Glue the handle in the head and the head into the body . A tail may be made from a piece of rope about Y2 inch diameter . Bind one end for a short distance with adhesive tape . Drill a hole to take this rope in the end of the body , then glue the rope in . Fray the rope by carefully separating the parts down to the finest fibers . Choose horse colors of brown , black , or white . A piebald arrangement of two of these colors can be attractive . The rockers can be the same color or green or black to represent the ground . An 67 eye painted in the right places helps the effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it can be indicated with black paint . NOAH 'S ARK In the biblical story of Noah and the flood there is no real clue to what design he used for his ark . Modern toy versions tend to look like houses erected on a simple hull . This makes for easy construction and should satisfy young owners , particularly if they can put their toy animals in and on the ark ( Fig. 5-24 ) . A boxlike construction provides a place to store these animals and other small toys . The size of the ark ought to bear some relation to the sizes of the animals . There can be a lot of tolerance . A child is unlikely to bother about proportions if he can get his toy animals into the ark . The sizes shown ( Fig. 5-25 ) make an ark that should not be too big or heavy for a child to carry , but its capacity should be enough . There is some outside deck space to stand animals on , and the roof lifts off to allow more to be put inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Framing may be ' - inch or %-inch square softwood strips that are glued and also held with thin nails . The boat part is made up as a unit , then the house part is fitted in . The roof is separate and made to fit the house part after that has been built into the hull . In that way you can get an accurate assembly with minimum trouble . Start by setting out a pair of sides . The half section ( Fig. 5-25A ) shows the sizes . Put framing pieces along the sides for attaching the bottom and deck , with other pieces for the sloping ends . The other piece to control sizes of other parts is the deck ( Fig. 5-26A ) . Make the widths of the side decks to suit the framing pieces along the sides ( Fig. 5-25B ) . Attach the deck to its supports along the sides and add the bottom ( Fig. 5-26B ) . Check squareness , but at this stage the bottom may overlap the sides slightly . Both the bottom and the 68 deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes of the ends . Put strips across to support the house ends ( Fig. 5-25C ) at the same time as you add the bottom . Trim the ends of the assembly and add the sloping ends of the hull . The top edges of the ends can be left as they are , but rounded pieces outside improve appearance and provide something to grip when lifting ( Fig. 5-26C ) . Make the house ends to fit in the hole through the deck . Give the top slopes of about 30 degrees . Cut window openings of any shape you prefer , but keep their top edges low enough to miss the roof ends that will fit inside ( Fig. 5-26D ) . Make the house sides to fit tightly between the house ends . Cut openings . A door on one side only , with windows beside it and more windows at the other side , should be satisfactory . Fit these parts in place with stiffening pieces in the corners ( Fig. 5-25D ) . Make two roof ends of solid wood to fit between the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Notch these to take a ridge piece planed to the slopes . Make the two sides of the roof to overhang about ? inch all around . Join them to the roof ends and ridge piece ( Fig. 5-26F ) . Arrange the fit so a child can lift off the roof . Be sure it is not so loose as to shake off when the ark is moved . 69 Make sure all sharpness is sanded off edges and corners , then paint the toy in bright colors . A light color inside will allow the contents to be seen easily . A light brown is suitable for the deck , but the rest of the wood can be any color you prefer . 70 71 TWISTING ACROBAT This is a traditional toy with a long history , but it is still made and sold by European craftsmen ( Fig. 5-27 ) . The loosely jointed man hangs from a twisted string . By squeezing and loosening the two projecting ends at the bottom , he can be made to perform various tricks as the string twists or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the string . Synthetic fishing line is now used , and it has a very long life . Use a hardwood that is not brittle for the sides . The other parts can be of the same wood , or the body and limbs may be plywood . Make the two sides ( Fig. 5-27A ) . Round their ends and mark the position of the bar , which will have to be held by two thin screws at each end . Cut the bar ( Fig. 5-27B ) with tapered and slightly rounded ends . There can be a very light cut across each side to provide a bed for the ends . Do not make this very deep , or it will weaken the side at the point where it gets most strain . Drill two holes inch apart near the tops of the sides for the fishing line ; 1/16-inch- diameter should do . Screw it into the bar ; 2 gauge by 3 inch is a suitable size . Draw the parts of the man ? one body , two arms , and two legs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out . If solid wood is used , have the grain lengthwise . Do some shaping by rounding edges if you wish , but the toy is quite effective with square edges . Drill the hands for the fishing line with the same size and spacing of holes as the frame sides . The other holes are for cotter pins , which may be inch in diameter , but the holes should be oversize so the limbs can flop about ( Fig. 5-27D ) . Paint the parts of the man before assembly . You can give him facial details and indicate trunks and socks . Clear varnish all over will seal the colors , and it can also be used on the frame . Assemble the man very loosely ( Fig. 5-27E ) . Table knife blades held between the parts while you spread the ends of the cotter pins should give a satisfactory amount of play . 72 The fishing line you need is monofilament . It is a single piece and not several strands twisted together . The line is graded in pounds . The choice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pass the line straight through without twists and temporarily tie the 73 ends . Turn the acrobat over and over to twist the line . Squeeze the bottoms of the sides and see what happens . You may have to experiment with the amount and tension of the line to get the best results before finally knotting . DOLL 'S CHAIR This is a chair ( Fig. 5-28 ) intended for a doll which a girl nurses . It is not for use in a dollhouse . The chair can be used on the floor when the child is playing there or put on the table . The tray swings over the back to hang down when not required . It can be made of solid wood , but 3 - inch plywood is better able to stand up to use without risk of cracking . 74 Mark out a side ( Fig. 5-30A ) to sizes from the general drawi ( Fig. 5-29A ) . Mark on the positions of the seat and the back . U this as a guide for marking the other side and the other parts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts can be made by drilling a hole about 1 inch and cutting into it ( Fig. 5-30B ) . Thicken the front of the seat with a strip under it . Put similar strips on each side ( Fig. 5-30C ) to support it . Check that the back and the seat are the same length . Assemble by screwing through the sides , but drill for the threaded part and the neck of each screw to reduce the risk of splitting when driving into edge grain . The tray swings on two arms , and it must be pivoted so it will swing over the back of the chair ( Fig. 5-29B ) . Make the two arms and cut the tray to fit between them , slightly longer than the width of the chair so the arms will swing freely . Curve the tray edges ( Fig. 76 5-29C ) . The rear edges of the tray should rest on the chair arms . Fit the tray between its strip with thin washers in the joints and under , the screwheads . If the parts are then found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed edges before painting . The sides of the chair can be decorated with decals . SAILBOAT Many toy sailboats may float , but they do little else . The owner becomes frustrated with the boat being incapable of going anywhere except broadside to the wind , and then falling flat on the water in the slightest gust . No very small craft can sail very efficiently because the wind and the water are still full-scale , and their effect on the little model is more like the effect of a hurricane on a full-size boat . A little sailboat may sail reasonably well on such sheltered water as a swimming pool or a pond when the wind is only a gentle breeze . This boat ( Fig. 5-31 ) is 12 inches long with other sizes in proportion . It does not have a rudder but is steered by adjusting the main sail with its " sheet " , which is the controlling string . The foresail works automatically . There are no shrouds or other mast stays . They are unnecessary on a model of this size , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lifted out and folded for storage or transport . Hull A woodworker unused to the compound curves of a boat hull may wonder how to set about shaping it . In this case there are two thicknesses , and their outlines provide a guide to shaping . The half drawings ( Fig. 5-32 ) are on a grid of squares . Copy the two hull drawings full-size . Use stiff paper or hardboard , so the outlines can be cut and used as templates turned over on the centerlines . The top piece ( Fig. 5-32A ) also has a hole cut out of its center . Use the same outline to cut the deck , except that it has a hatch cut in 77 t ( Fig. 5-32B ) . This should be marine plywood if possible , but other ) lywood bonded with waterproof glue is suitable . Mark out the ower piece ( Fig. 5-32C ) in the same way . Cut to the outline . There has to be a slot for the keel cut in the bottom piece , and hat is more easily done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 78 from Vs-inch sheet metal . It can be brass . If steel is used , painting will protect it from rust . Cut the slot about % inch deep with a narrow chisel and a knife , so the keel will press in ( Fig. 5-32D ) . Glue the two hull parts together . Be careful to get them symmetrical on each other . Use waterproof glue . When the glue has 79 set , trim the blocks so they have the correct shape in side view ( Fig. 5-32E ) . At the center of the boat , get the hull into a smooth curve crosswise ( Fig. 5-32F ) . Trim the stern to a similar but smaller curve . You now have the hull the right shape when viewed from the side or the end . Round off the other parts to the same shape on each side , using the joint between the two blocks as a guide to how far to go . Remove large pieces with a chisel , but closer work is better done with a spokeshave or a Surform tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joint , there can not be much difference between the sides . At this stage you can leave the hull surface rough for finishing after other constructional work . Mast The mast is made from a piece of %-inch dowel rod . Check its size and drill to make a push fit in the deck ( Fig. 5-32G ) . Glue the deck to the hull . There can be some small brass nails around the edges as well . Drill through the mast hole in the deck to go about % inch into the bottom of the hull ( Fig. 5-32H ) . Make sure the drill is upright in both directions . Trim the deck edges to the hull and smooth the hull all over . Fit the keel into its slot with epoxy adhesive . The hatch cover can be cut from a solid piece of wood or two pieces glued together ( Fig. 5-33A ) . Make it a push fit in the opening in the deck , so it can be removed to stow cargo or empty out water . Leave the bottom few inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about half thickness at the top . Remove plane marks by sanding . The main boom is another piece of dowel rod about inch thick . In a full-size boat it is joined to the mast with a universal joint called a gooseneck . Here you can use two linked screw eyes ( Fig. 5-33B ) . Lever one open , then close it with pliers after linking to the other . Sails The sails will remain attached to the mast for most of the boat 's life , so there is no need to fit them as you would on a full-size boat . Several materials can be used . Light synthetic woven cloth is difficult to sew into satisfactory shapes . Cotton is better . It should be fairly closely woven , but in this small boat it does not matter much about the weave . Turn in and sew the edges to the sizes shown ( Fig. 5-33C ) . There has to be an attachment at each corner . You can sew around little holes , like miniature buttonholes , or there can be eyelets or grommets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable . Make the sleeve of the main sail to slide easily over the mast . Slide the main sail over the mast and attach the lower corner with thread around the screw eye or through a hole in the wood ( Fig. 5-33D ) . Do the same near the top of the mast ( Fig. 5-33E ) with a 81 moderate tension , but do not stretch enough to crease the cloth . At the end of the boom , use thread through a hole there ( Fig. 5-33F ) . In use you may want to adjust this attachment , so have the hole in the boom a little way further out than the end of the sail foot . Tie the thread in a way that can be easily altered . At the top of the foresail , use a thread to a screw eye into the mast ( Fig. 5-33G ) . The forward corner will have to be released when you want to remove the sailing gear , so either knot to a screw eye or make a wire hook there ( Fig. 5-3310 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to a " horse " . This is an arrangement where a line from the sail is attached to a ring that slides on a rod across the deck ( Fig. 5-34A ) . As the boat changes direction in relation to the wind , the ring travels across . The amount of slack in the line will have to be found by experimentation . The main sheet will have to be adjusted according to the direction the boat is to sail in relation to the wind . When the boat is to sail before the wind , the boom has to be let out almost square to the centerline of the boat . If it is to sail across the wind , the boom is hauled in a little , but not as far as 45 degrees to the centerline . If the boom is hauled in further , the boat should sail slightly towards the direction of the wind . Do not expect too much windward perfor mance from this little boat . Knot the main sheet through a hole in the end of the boom ( Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the stern ( Fig. 5-34C ) , then forward along the deck to another screw eye ( Fig. 5-34D ) . It can be knotted here and adjusted by reknotting , but a little sheet metal runner , similar to those used on some tent ropes , will allow quicker adjustment ( Fig. 5-34E ) . Bending the runner helps it to grip . A little flag at the top of the mast is a decorative touch . If you have used a good hardwood for the hull , it will look great with several coats of varnish , preferably a marine grade . Otherwise , paint the hull and varnish the deck and spars . DOLL 'S BUNK BED UNIT The sizes of this unit are intended to suit dole about 15 inches 82 tall . The unit will accommodate two dolls . There is a large clothes closet at one end where dresses can be hung , as well as storage under the bottom bunk for other things . The whole unit should be stood against the wall in a girl 's bedroom ( Figs. 5-35 and 5-36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for the bottom of the bunks and as an alternative to plywood for the back . The parts are glued and held with thin nails or pins . Reinforcing some of the joints inside with strips strengthens them and in most places serves other purposes , too . Start by making the back ( Fig. 5-37A ) . If you mark on it the positions of other parts , that shows you the layout and their sizes . Make the two closet sides and the bunk end ( Fig. 5-37B ) . The ends extend 3/a inch to the floor and are cut away so they will stand firm . The top of the bunk end is curved down at the front to the bunk side . Cut down the fronts of the bunks ( Fig. 5-37C ) and round the edges . Cut pieces for the bottom of the unit and the bunk bottoms . 84 Put 1-inch wide strips with a piece of V4-inch dowel rod be tween as a clothes rail inside the top of the closet ( Fig. 5-38A ) . Cut back the strips at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same at both ends below the bottom bunk to act as stops for that door ( Fig. 5-37D ) . 85 Use the back as a pattern when assembling parts , but do not nail it on until all the other joints have been made . The hardboard bunk bottoms will need supporting along their backs ( Fig. 5-38B ) . With the assembly completed , cut the doors to fit . Use small hinges if possible ( Fig. 5-37E ) , preferably within the joints , but 86 wider hinges can be put on the surface . Alternatively , use strips of cloth as hinges . You need handles for opening , but if you can not get small knobs , strips of wood may be used . To keep the doors closed , provide friction at the meeting surfaces . A short length of rubber or cloth in the opening should be sufficient . For an authentic appearance there should be aladder to the top bunk , but it need not have any attachment as it will not actually be climbed . A suitable one can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 5-38C ) . Paint everything in bright colors , but the inside will be clearer if they are lightly colored . Add decals if you wish . // A box in which to put toys is often improvised from something else . This special one is light to handle , has a smooth interior , and it can be moved about by a child or his mother . She can even give the child a ride in it . It is strong enough to stand up to rough use and big enough to collect small toys and other things . All framing is outside , so there are no obvious obstructions inside . The arrangement allows bars to be put across as handles . With the sizes shown ( Fig. 5-39 ) , V4-inch plywood framed with 3/4-inch strips can be used . Cut plywood for the two ends and the bottom to the same widths . Frame these outside ( Fig. 5-40A ) by using glue and nails or screws driven from inside . Join the ends to the bottom . Long screws can be used , but %-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 5-40B ) . Drill through and let the dowels project until the glue has set . Trim them level . Glue and nail plywood sides to the ends and the bottom . Add stiffening strips to the top edges with nails driven from inside , but at the corners use dowels ( Fig. 5-40C ) . When the corners are rounded , the dowel ends will shape with them . Make the handles from similar square strips , but round towards the center by taking off sharpness ( Fig. 5-40D ) . Attach the handle ends with dowels in a similar way to the top corners . There have to be some pads under the bottom corners to take the casters ( Fig. 5-40E ) . Size will have to suit the caster plates , but 3 inches square should be adequate . Round off all angles , but at the corners make fairly large curves . If you have used attractive wood and the finish is with varnish , the dowel ends make a decorative feature . Otherwise , paint all over and decorate with decals if you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . The figure might be human ( Fig. 5-41 ) , although monkeys and other animals were also used . There is a long stick and a shorter one held against it . 88 When the shorter stick is moved up and down , the acrobat performs tricks on the top of his pole . There can be some plywood used in the figure in a modern version , but oddments of hardwood will probably be stronger . Strength is mainly required lengthwise . The two sticks are square with straight grain , as any tendency to warp might affect movement . 89 The case around the sticks ( Fig. 5-41A ) serves as a handle . If both sticks start with the same section , plane just a shaving off the long one to reduce its section slightly . Then it will move easily through the case ( Fig. 5-41B ) . Round all corners of the case . 90 Make the body ( Fig. 5-41C ) the same thickness as the short stick . It can be left in outline form , or you can whittle it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The arms and legs ( Figs. 5-41D and 5-41E ) will look better if fairly thin . Round on the outer surfaces only if you want to improve their shapes . 91 The simplest pivots are cotter pins . Neater joints are made with rivets , which can be lengths of ' /s-inch copper or aluminum wire lightly hammered on opposite sides ( Fig. 5-41F ) . Do not overtighten . The parts must move very easily to be effective and workable by a child . Paint the parts of the figure if you wish . The sticks and case may be left plain . 92 and uses sticks with a sliding action to produce movement in the figures . The example ( Fig. 5-42 ) is shown with two men wielding hammers on an anvil , but some traditional types have animals . One common one had a bear at one side and his trainer at the other . The two figures are solid blocks ( Fig. 5-42A ) . Their legs have to be made from the full thickness to fit over the two sticks ( Fig. 5-42B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more lifelike shapes . The action can put quite a strain on the arms , and they should not be reduced too much . The hammers can be metal . They are easier to make with short pieces of Y2-inch dowel rod as heads and Y8-inch wire handles ( Fig. 5-42C ) . The sticks may be longer than shown . It is a good idea to have them too long until you are quite satisfied with the action , then trim and round the ends to a length that suits you . Pivots may be cotter pins taken right through , or you can lightly rivet pieces of copper or aluminum wire . With this thick ness , wood nails can be used in drilled holes . Choose a length that will just go through , then file the points level . The pivot points may be 8 inches apart . Locate the points with the figures upright . If you are uncertain about the action , put thin nails loosely in the pivot and try the movement . When you have the figures permanently pivoted , put a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 5-42D ) . If you substitute metal there , the noise may be more satisfying to the young user . Paint the figures if you wish , but the other parts may be left plain . 93 Chapter 6 The freighter is a pull-along toy , and it is not intended to float . As designed , it will tend to turn over if put in water , although that can be prevented if a strip of lead is nailed along the center of the bottom as ballast . This boat is best used as a dry land toy . It is given a cargo of four blocks which can be loaded and unloaded . This toy can be made from offcuts of wood . The sizes can be adjusted , but as drawn ( Figs. 6-1 and 6-2 ) the hull is made from a block of 2-inch by 4-inch wood . Other sizes are proportional . You can use softwood , but the hull will be stronger if made of hardwood . As much of the wood is cut away , the total weight will not be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it running smoothly . FREIGHTER Mark out the wood for the hull ( Fig. 6-3A ) . Hollowing should be done before the outline is shaped , as the squared wood is easier to hold when in a vise or clamped to a bench . The bulk of the waste in the recesses is most easily removed with a powered router . That will work away most of the waste in stages and , if carefully done , only corners will need to be trimmed with a chisel to finish the shapes . Alternatively , drill many holes into the waste parts and remove the waste by chiseling . Be careful not to drill too deeply . If the drill is used in a drill press , its stop will limit the depth . Otherwise , have a depth stop on the drill . Drill across for the roller axles . These may be steel or brass rods about 3/16-in. diameter . Also , drill for the 94 towing string . A Y2-inch hole upwards will take the knot , and another small hole diagonally into it passes the string ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bow should be the same each side , or any error will be obvious . Curve the stern evenly and slope up underneath . The deck house is a simple block of wood ( Fig. 6-3C ) beveled at one end and with a notch to take the bridge at the other end . Make the bridge ( Fig. 6-3D ) to match the width of the hull and fit into the notch . The funnel is a piece of round rod ( Fig. 6-3E ) . Drill at a slight angle so it slopes aft , but to keep modern lines cut the top parallel with the deck . Glue these parts together and to the hull . A few nails will help to keep the parts correctly located and supplement the glue , but punch the heads below the surface and cover with stopping . The mast block is a simple piece . A tall mast might look effective , but there is the risk of it being broken . Keep it fairly short ( Fig. 6-3F ) and round its top . Attach this assembly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length to the width and thickness of the cargo blocks , then cut them to length and round their corners . The blocks should be easy to fit into the " hold , " so the young owner is not frustrated by trying to force them in . The rollers are pieces of 2-inch diameter rod . If a lathe is available , they can be turned and drilled accurately on it . Otherwise , 95 prepared rod can be used , but be careful to accurately center the holes . Drill partway from each end for greater accuracy . It is not difficult to make the rollers from a length of square wood that is longer than needed . Plane the corners off to make the section octagonal , then plane off those corners to get the wood approxi mately round . Hole the wood by its end , so it stands upwards in the 98 vise . Round it by pulling a strip of abrasive paper backwards and forwards around it . The rollers should fit easily into their recesses and turn easily on their axles . Make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axles exactly to length with smooth ends . Fasten them into the holes in the hull with epoxy glue ( Fig. 6-3G ) . Paint all parts brightly . The deck and upper parts can be a lighter color than the lower part of the hull , while the cargo blocks can each be a different color . It will help the user if the towing string is taken through a short piece of dowel rod to form a grip ( Fig. 6-3H ) . Have a large knot inside the hole in the hull , so the string will not pull out . WAGON A box on wheels is a basic toy for any youngster . If the wagon has a handle so it can be pulled along , it can be loaded with toys . The child can pretend that a big transport operation is underway . Dolls can be taken for rides . Sand and stones may be moved about . Many sizes are possible . A larger wagon may have more uses outdoors . If it is made large enough that a child may ride on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than if it is a lighter and smaller toy for use indoors as well . The sizes shown ( Fig. 6-4 ) are suitable for a young child and can be increased . The wagon will be just as satisfactory if the sides are / inch deeper or shallower . Use hardwood . The grain of many softwoods will not stand up to wrenching and splitting strains . The parts are overlapped and either nailed or screwed . If nails are used , punch them below the surface and cover with stopping . Screws are preferable , as they hold better in end grain . For most of the assembly , flat head screws 1 inch by 6 gauge will be suitable . Drill for all screws to minimize the risk of splitting . Make the box first . It is shown with the ends attached first to the bottom ( Fig. 6-5A ) . Then the sides are added ( Fig. 6-5B ) . If all of 99 the parts are carefully squared , there should be no difficulty in assembly . Round the top edges slightly before assembly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plastic wheels may be bought . Metal wheels with rubber tires are suitable , particularly if the wagon will be used over carpets . All of these wheels have fairly small central holes , and they can be arranged to run on stout round head screws ( Fig. 6-5C ) . Arrange for 100 a washer to be under the screwhead and another between the wheel and the end of the wood axle ( Fig. 6-5D ) . You can make wooden wheels . It is possible to saw and sand discs . If a lathe is available , production of truly circular wheels is easy . With a lathe the outer surfaces can be turned to stimulate a wheel and tire effect . Whichever way the wooden wheels are made , 101 they revolve with less risk of wobble if they are given axles thicker than screws . A piece of %-inch or %-inch dowel rod can be used ( Fig. 6-5E ) . Let the wooden axles project a little each side of the box . Drill for screws or dowel rods . Allow enough dowel rod to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washer and a hole drilled through for a split pin . Screw the wooden pieces in place from inside the box . PUSH TRUCK Some children prefer to push wheeled toys rather than pull a wagon . Girls may prefer to have their dolls seated in front of them instead of following in a box behind . This push truck ( Fig. 6-6A ) is constructed in a generally similar way to the wagon . It is wider because a child pushing needs more stability , particularly if the toy is being used to help him or her learn to walk . The box can be made in the same way as the wagon 's box , but it is shown with a plywood bottom . There is a taper to the front ( Fig. 6-6B ) . Cut the two sides to match each other first , then nail or screw them to the back and front . Round all the top edges . Use glue and nails or screws to attach the plywood . Make the axles and wheel assemblies in the same way as described for the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attach them to the box with screws from inside . Make sure the axles are parallel and square across the bottom ; otherwise , the youngster will have difficulty in pushing the truck straight . The handle shown ( Fig. 6-6C ) is at a height that should suit most young children . The handle is drawn at 60 degrees to the floor , but the exact angle is not critical . Do not slope the handle too far back , or it may be liable to tilt the truck backwards unintentionally . The part of the handle that is held is a piece of round rod . Check what diameter a particular child finds most comfortable to grip . If a 102 lathe is available , shoulder the ends of the rod to fit into holes in the sides ( Fig. 6-6D ) . Otherwise , cut the ends to length . Use two nails or screws into each end ( Fig. 6-6E ) . Bevel the bottom ends of the handle sides . Round the tops and all edges before screwing to the box sides . Thoroughly sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Materials List for Push Truck YARD WAGON If a wagon is to be made large enough for a child to ride in while another youngster pulls it , it has to be of a size and construction suitable for use outdoors . The wagon must not be heavier than necessary , and it must have wheels that revolve with minimum resistance . It must also be steerable , so the child pulling can take it where he wishes without having to skid wheels sideways . There must obviously be a limit to the weight carried . The wagon shown ( Fig. 6-7 ) should carry a seven-year-old child . A bigger child or an adult can pull it . Sizes of other parts are governed by the available wheels and axles . Wooden wheels are unsuitable . The dimensions given allow for metal or plastic wheels with rubber tires , having overall diam eters of about 6 inches , with a %-inch diameter steel rod as an axle . If the axle can not be cut to length and the assemblies have to be bought complete , the distance between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more . For the sake of stability the wheel spread should be at least the same as the width of the wagon 's body . Do not make a wagon with wheels inside the width of the base . Because the wagon will be used outdoors and may be left there in the rain , any plywood used should be waterproof . Paint and varnish should also be suitable for outdoor use . Make a drawing of one end of the body full-size ( Fig. 6-8A ) . This will give you the angle to cut and the positions of the slats . Mark the widths of the slats from the actual pieces of wood . It does not matter if they are slightly different from the size specified . Cut the ends and bevel the bottom edge . From the drawing mark the slat positions and cut away the edges Y8 inch for them ( Fig. 6-8B ) . Round the tops and take off sharpness at the corners . Attach the ends to the bottom with glue and screws from below . Get the lengths of the slats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon ends , but round the edges before putting 104 them in place . Fit with glue and screws . Plywood does not give a very good grip on short screws driven into its edges . Use 2-inch by 8-gauge screws for 3/4-inch plywood to 3/4-inch plywood . For the best finish , counterbore the screwheads and cover them with stopping . 106 Check squareness and be sure that opposite sides measure the same during assembly . The method of pivoting the front axle determines the construc-tion of the underframing . It is possible to get turntables intended for revolving chairs or such things as radio stands . Not all are strong enough if they are only intended for table use . If a suitable one can be obtained of not more than 5 inches in diameter , it will make a neat and satisfactory pivot . The alternative is to use a bolt which has a shallow head and a square neck to pull into the wood . The bolt may go right through the wagon bottom , but it is better let into the bottom stiffener ( Fig. 6-8C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rub directly on each other , so allow for a large washer . A piece of sheet metal can be cut . A piece of ? - inch plywood will have a reasonable life . In either case make the diameter the same as the width of the link wood ( Fig. 6-8D ) . The bolt goes through and is secured with a washer and nut , then the end of the bolt is hammered over to prevent the nut working loose ( Fig. 6-8E ) . Use grease or candle fat on each side of the washer in the final assembly . Cut the front axle piece to size . Make blocks to go across the ends to take the axle rod ( Fig. 6-8F ) . The thickness of these blocks has to be enough to allow the axle to clear the end of the pivot bolt , if that is used . If there is a turntable , the steel axle can be higher . The link is a parallel piece . It is glued and screwed to the front axle strip and projects forward . Drill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep this far enough back from the end , so there is sufficient wood left to prevent the end grain breaking out ( Fig. 6-8G ) . Drill for the bolt if that is to be used or fit the turntable temporarily . Try the assembly in position . Check the distance the axle rod comes from the bottom of the body . The rear axle has to be at the same distance . Make the rear axle supports accordingly ( Fig. 6-8H ) . Join them with glue and screw through the bottom . Check the fit of the axle through the two blocks . Allow for washers to keep the wheels away from the blocks . The handle assembly can be given some rough use by a child when there is a comparatively heavy load and the wheels are on rough ground , so make it strongly . The sides ( Fig. 6-9A ) have two spacers as well as the handle rod . For the strongest construction they should be tenoned ( Fig. 6-9B ) . They can be cut squarely , and then screws can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy fit on the link . Drill that end to suit the pivot rod , but keep the hole far enough back to reduce the risk of splitting . 107 Round the ends of the rod used for the handle ( Fig. 6-9C ) and fit it through its holes with glue and thin nails driven edgewise . After all of the wooden parts have been painted , attach the handle with a piece of steel rod . The rod should be long enough to allow for washers on each side and for the rod ends to be lightly hammered over to prevent the washers coming off . The whole wagon can be varnished , but it will be more appeal ing if it is painted brightly . If an attractive hardwood has been used for the slats and the handle , however , they might be varnished while the other parts are painted . In any case a two-color scheme seems appropriate . Decals may be added to the ends , but they are not 108 waterproof . Apply two coats of varnish over them for protection . CONSTRUCTIONAL TRUCKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several ways has obvious attractions . Parts can be made into trucks of various types or put together as a train with a diesel locomotive and assorted freight cars . The parts can be made into a snake or other animal that wobbles as it is pulled along the floor . The toy described here is shown with parts that will assemble into trucks and trains . The shapes are basic , and much depends on the painting schemes used to indicate what the parts are . Great detail would not be appropriate for this toy ( Fig. 6-10 ) . The sizes shown will make a fairly substantial toy that should stand up to rough treatment . Sizes can be modified up or down , but making the parts too small might lead to trouble . Small section wood can be broken or chewed and small wheels might be too easy for the youngster to remove or put in his or her mouth . The parts shown as 2 ? inches square should not be reduced to less than 1 ? inches , and other parts are made in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that might suit a well-developed child . Use a close-grained hardwood so the risk of splintering is reduced , but choose a wood that is not heavy as well as hard . Select wheels at the same time as the wood . They can be turned if you have a lathe , but if bought they might be plastic or rubber instead of wood . Choose a diameter that will clear the bodies of parts . If you have to accept slightly larger wheels , you may have to use thicker wood for the linking pieces . The materials list gives the sizes of wood for individual parts , but a set may consist of a locomotive with two passenger cars , one flattop car , one open freight car , and one closed car . There can be several truck and van bodies . If all of these parts were assembled at the same time , a child might use at least 10 linking pieces . It is best to limit the assemblies by only providing four or five linking pieces , so the child only puts together one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic parts that all other parts should fit are the linking pieces , and these should all be the same ( Fig. 6-11A ) . It helps to make a jig to get the hole spacings the same in all parts . This can be a piece of plywood the size of the linking piece , with two small holes at the correct spacing ( Fig. 6-11B ) . If the holes are no more than 1/16-inch diameter , the drill used to make them can also be used to mark through , either to just make a dent or actually drill into the wood . At that size it will serve as a guide for the center of a woodworking drill bit . Use a piece of plywood and put stops at each side to get the line of holes central in the wood marked , whether it is 2 inches or 2% inches wide ( Fig. 6-11C ) . Check the actual widths of the wood being used and center the hole line to suit . Mark out all the linking pieces you intend to produce on one long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dowel rod pegs ( Fig. 6-11D ) . A drill press will help you get the holes drilled perpendicularly . If you drill by hand , get an assistant to sight the direction of the drill so you hold it squarely . Round the tops of the pegs and glue them into the base . Position the wheels in line with the pegs . Arrange the heights of their centers so the wheels come far enough below the top edge of the base to clear anything added above . Most wheels can be mounted on wood screws with washers on each side ( Fig. 6-11E ) . If the wheels are intended to be mounted on a rod axle , drill right through for it . Where two parts have to pivot on the linking piece , their ends must have enough clearance to allow for turning without interfering with each other . Cut ends squarely . Use a compass set for half the width to draw the curved amount that will be trimmed off to provide turning clearance ( Fig. 6-11F ) . Passenger Car A passenger car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ( Fig. 6-12A ) . Use the jig to mark for holes at each end ? double at each position as the end car in a train will have the linking piece underneath its end ( Fig. 6-12B ) . Besides shaping the ends , round the top to represent the roof . Any other details are indicated by painting ( Fig. 6-12C ) . The holes can be enlarged to allow the pegs to 112 be fitted easily by work with a round file , and the pegs can be eased by sanding around them . Flatcar A flatcar ( Fig. 6-12D ) is thin enough to drill right through . Except for shaping the ends , there is no special work . You can put 113 some small pegs near the edges , so a load of round rods can be lashed on ( Fig. 6-12E ) to represent logs or pipes . Open and Closed Freight Cars An open freight car ( Fig. 6-12F ) is a development of the flatcar and is merely a box nailed together . Keep the box ends a short distance back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A closed freight car is the same as a passenger car , except for different painting . A diesel locomotive can be very similar , except for sloping the front and painting it to indicate windows and other parts ( Fig. 6-12G ) . 114 Trucks The simplest road truck can have a front shaped like a diesel locomotive . A better shape can be made with two cuts ( Fig. 6-13A ) . A plain van is just a parallel block . Drill below to allow the linking pieces to go fully under to make an eight-wheel vehicle . A trailer might be made like . the rail passenger car and coupled with the linking piece ( Fig. 6-13B ) . A child may prefer to have an open truck , so he or she can load it with wood blocks or other things . A solid block might be cut down behind the cab , but it is easier to start with a base like a flat rail car , then make a box over the rear part ( Fig. 6-13C ) . A trailer to attach to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the same thing might serve a dual purpose . Semitrailer A semitrailer makes an interesting assembly . The towing part is made like a short truck or van , but of a size to fit over one link piece ( Fig. 6-13D ) . The towed part also travels on one link piece , or may be extended to two , but it projects forward ( Fig. 6-13E ) . Cut away the two parts so they will lap on each other while still remaining level ? about half the depth of each piece should be satisfactory ( Fig. 6-13F ) . Put a peg in one piece to make sure there is enough clearance for both parts to turn without fouling each other ( Fig. 6-13G ) . Snake Assembly If an assembly is to be made like a snake or other creature , construction is much the same as a train ( Fig. 6-14A ) . It is possible to give the parts some shape with a band saw or jigsaw . The forward part must have some semblance of a head , while the last piece tapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be rounded ( Fig. 6-14C ) . The effect is heightened by suitable painting . Painting is important for the other assemblies . Seal the wood first and give all parts a coat of primer to form a base for the colors . The link pieces should not attract attention . They might be gray or black . Other parts making up a train can be in colors to match the local line or painted brightly to appeal to the young owner . Windows can be simulated with aluminum-colored paint . Sides can be emblazoned with names of a genuine trucking company or something made up to include the owner 's name . Good paint has a reasonable resistance to rough use and abrasion , but clear varnish over the paint will brighten and protect it . 115 Figure Some children may be quite happy pushing a locomotive or truck and pushing , as they imagine themselves to be driving it . Others may prefer to pull with a string . To allow for that , put a screw eye in the end of one linking piece . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be turned inwards when not required . // This is a toy to push or pull along . The tractor can be used alone , or a trailer may be hooked on . The front tractor wheel axle can be turned , so the toy may follow a curve when pushed . The trailer described has a tipping body , so it can be loaded with blocks or sand . The user can tip them after a delivery . Other trailers can be made , so the tractor may tow a variety of loads . Sides might be hinged for unloading from the side . There can be a flat top for awkward loads or removable parts to allow for carrying straw or logs . Construction is fairly basic with no fine detail that can be broken or cause accidents ( Figs. 6-15 and 6-16 ) . Some detail can be painted on , but general painting in bright colors is simpler and more acceptable . Sizes are dependent on the wheels . If a lathe is available , they may be turned to size to suit what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exact measurements . Other parts may have to be altered . The large rear tractor wheels settle the height from the floor , as they turn on screws driven into the center of the thickness of the base piece . The depth of the front axle has to be 119 made to allow those smaller wheels to lift the base parallel with the floor . The trailer base goes above the tractor base , so that wheel axle piece has to be of a suitable depth to lift it level . 120 Make the tractor base ( Fig. 6-17A ) and mark on it the positions of the other parts . It looks best with the front slightly rounded . At the rear use the center for the peg with a compass to draw the shape before drilling a %-inch hole . Keep the parts where the large wheels come parallel and flat , but taper and round the other edges . The engine can have as much shape as you like to put into it . If the child is familiar with a particular make of tractor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 6-17B ) the top is rounded 121 slightly , and the front has a curve similar to the front of the base . It is undercut , and two round upholstery nails represent lamps . At the other end there can be a part cut away below a sloping instrument panel . A small wheel free to pivot on a screw will provide the user with a steering wheel to twiddle . The seat can be cut from a solid block ( Fig. 6-17C ) , but it may be easier to use a piece of plywood for the back ( Fig. 6-17D ) . In either case round the top , so there is nothing rough to scratch a hand . Glue and screw these parts through the base . Also , glue a piece of dowel rod into the hole . Round its top . The wheels will probably be different thicknesses . Fit the large rear wheels on screws with washers between them and the tractor base . Make the front axle ( Fig. 6-17E ) of a size that will bring the outsides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attach the wheels with screws and washers , then drive a pivot screw into the base . As the axle ought to stay in any position it is put , let the wood surface rub on each other to provide friction and do not include a washer between them , although there could be one under the screwhead . After a trial assembly , remove the wheels and axle so the wood can be painted . If the wheels are wood , they can be painted a different color from the rest of the tractor . The trailer base ( Fig. 6-18A ) is wider than the tractor . The base and most other parts of the trailer can be plywood instead of solid wood . Mark the hole that will hook over the peg on the tractor . Draw the outline around it . Hollowing the sides gives a better appearance and provides clearance when the trailer swings close to the tractor wheels . The hole can be larger than the tractor peg , as there is no need for a close fit . The tractor wheels may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a suitable height to bring the trailer base level when the wheels are screwed on . If a tipping body is to be made ( Fig. 6-18B ) , make its bottom slightly wider than the trailer base to give clearance for the sides . Lay out the shape on a side ( Fig. 6-18C ) and make two matching sides . Drill for the pivot screws and try one side on the bottom and base . Note how much rounding of the base 's end will be needed to allow for tipping . Nail and glue the sides to the bottom . Make and fit the piece across the front ( Fig. 6-18D ) . Make a trial assembly and see that the body will tip . It is not intended to go past upright . A strut across the 122 front may swing on a screw and support the body at a moderate angle ( Fig. 6-18E ) . If other trailers are made , do not have much behind the line of the wheels . Otherwise , there is a risk of tipping unintentionally . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better four wheels 123 ( Fig. 6-18F ) . An alternative to a plain box trailer is to make one with solid ends and one or two rails along the sides ( Fig. 6-18G ) . Holes around the edge of a flatbed trailer would allow pegs to hold logs ( Fig. 6-18H ) or sides with dowels to lift off ( Fig. 6-18J ) . DOLL CARRIAGE This is a strong carriage that is able to stand up to a youngster 's rough treatment better than one modeled more closely on the usual full-size baby carriage ( Fig. 6-19 ) . The sizes shown ( Fig. 6-20 ) should suit most girls to which the design will appeal , but it may be necessary to adapt them to fit a particular child , especially in the height and position of the handle . Construction is shown with the main parts made of %-inch plywood . The plywood has enough rigidity not to need stiffening along free edges . If thinner plywood or hardboard is used , strips of solid wood should be fitted along edges that are otherwise unsup ported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unwise to use that thickness throughout . The result will be a heavy car riage . The wheels shown are metal with rubber tires and diameters about 6 inches . They are mounted on axles % inch or V2 inch in diameter . Get the wheels and axles first , as wood sizes may have to be adapted if wheel sizes are very different . Start by marking out the two sides ( Fig. 6-22A ) . Fit 1/2-inch square strips at the ends above where the bottom will come ( Fig. 124 6-21A ) . Allow for the wheel frames overlapping by 1 inch ( Fig. 6-21B ) . Use glue and thin nails for assembly . Cut hollows in the top edges and round the corners ( Fig. 6-21C ) . Make sure the opposite sides are properly paired and that their shapes match . Mark on the positions of the handles at 45 degrees to horizontal ( Fig. 6-22B ) . Mark out the wheel frames ( Fig. , 6-22C ) . See that their lengths match the carriage sides . it will help to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frame , then use it to mark the parts each side of a centerline . Cut the outlines , clean off any raggedness , and round and sand the edges . Note that the hollow in the curve of the ends is needed to give clearance to the hood when it is lowered . Cut the pieces for the ends and the bottom to the same width between the sides . The ends of the bottom and the top edges of the end pieces can be trimmed after assembly . Glue and nail the ends between the sides . Put stiffening pieces across the bottom edges of the ends , planed to the angle of the bottom , and then put the bottom plywood in ( Fig. 6-21D ) . Add the wheel frames inside the carriage sides close under the bottom ( Fig. 6-21E ) . Use glue in all meeting parts . Nail down through the bottom into the edges of the wheel frames before the glue hardens . Check that the whole assembly is square . Stand it level , under weights if necessary , until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are simple strips with rounded ends . Drill for the round rod deep enough for the joints to be glued and screwed from outside ( Fig. 6-22E ) . Make sure that the distance 125 between the sides match the overall width of the carriage . Fit the handles to the sides by screwing from inside or bolting through . These are joints that may be better without glue . If the handle height has to be altered as the child grows or another girl takes over , it can be done easily be redrilling . Make a pair of hood sides ( Fig. 6-22F ) . They will be better pivoting on bolts and nuts than on wood screws , so drill the hood sides and carriage sides for /-inch bolts . Mark on a side first where 126 the hood will come and mount it temporarily on the carriage side . Swing it to see that the finished hood will clear the corners and go low enough at the wheel frame . The bottom hood frame piece is straight and nailed between the sides ( Fig. 6-21F ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollowed and rounded in section ( Fig. 6-21G ) . Make a temporary strut to go between the bolt holes while the hardboard is 127 fitted . All of the pieces across should be of a length that will allow the hood to swing with a little clearance over the carriage . Makeup this assembly using screws through the bolt holes into the tempo rary strut . Cut the hardboard piece slightly oversize . Spring it to shape . If this is difficult , moisten it . Have some clamps ready . Put glue on the meeting surfaces and start at the bottom edge with thin nails fairly closely spaced . Clamp to the bottom frame piece . Go around the curve with more nails ( Fig. 6-21H ) until you can nail to the top piece , where it is advisable to grip with more clamps until the glue has set . When this has happened , remove the clamps and trim the edges . Round all exposed parts , particularly corners . Try the hood in position after the temporary strut has been removed . See that its action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be easy for a young girl to release and lower . Position a block of wood on the center of the end , with its lower edge level with where the hood should come when it is in the up position . Shape a short piece of wood as a turn button under it , pivoting on a screw with a washer under its head ( Fig. 6-21J ) . Make it long enough to go under the end of the hood and around its end . It can be swung back when the hood is to be lowered . Finish the hood and handles in bright colors different from those of the rest of the carriage . That completes the woodwork . RIDING CRANE This is a mobile crane on which a small child can sit ( Fig. 6-23 ) . It is mounted on furniture casters . The youngster can use his or her feet to propel it about the floor while lifting and moving loads . The child 's weight on the rear platform provides stability , while he or she can alter the angle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pawls on ratchet wheels give the young engineer more 128 levers to move . The toy should be strong enough to stand up to normal use . With a child sitting astride it , there should be no fear of it toppling with any load he or she tries to lift . Some of the parts are plywood , but the control tower is solid wood . Round parts can be made from dowel rods . The four casters are the type intended to be attached with screws . They should be obtained at the start , so any adjustment of size can be arranged to suit them . The type of caster with a stem to go into a leg can not be used . The general drawing ( Fig. 6-24 ) shows overall sizes . If you decide on variations , they will affect some of the information in the detail drawings . Start by making the base ( Fig. 6-25A ) from ' - inch plywood . Round the rear corners and edges . Mark on the position of the control tower . Put blocks underneath for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mounting plates and spread widely for stability . Mark out the control tower sides ( Fig. 6-25B ) and make them to match . Drill through for the % inch dowel rod winding drums . Make the jib supports ( Fig. 6-25C ) and the two crosswise pieces ( Fig. 6-25D ) . Drill a small hole centrally in the top piece to take the end of a cord . Join these parts with glue and nails or screws . Mount the assembly on the base with the jib supports projecting forward over the edge . The jib sides look best if they are given a curved taper towards the top ( Fig. 6-26A ) . Mark them to take a spacing block at the bottom . A short length of dowel rod serves as a spacer where the tops are pulled in ( Fig. 6-26B ) . Make the width of the spacing block to let the assembly be an easy fit between the jib supports . 130 The other three crosswise pieces shown serve as guides for cords . They can be pieces of ' /4-inch dowel rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round iron rod about 3/16 inch in diameter which can be cut from large nails . The lifting cable goes under the lower one , then over the top one and down to the load . The jib-adjusting cable goes around the middle one and back to the hole in the top piece of the control tower . The jib can pivot on another 131 similar iron rod , or there can be screws through the supports into the end of the jib . Make the two winding drums overlong at first ( Fig. 6-26C ) . Drill a hole in each to take the knotted end of the cord . If the ratchet wheels are glued on , the crank handles can be held with screws only , so it will be possible to withdraw the drums if necessary later . 132 Make the crank handles ( Fig. 6-26D ) from plywood , unless you have some close-grained hardwood that will resist splitting . Glue in a piece of thinner dowel rod for the grip . The ratchets should also be of plywood . There can be any number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 133 circumference into six by stepping off the radius around it ( Fig. 6-26E ) . Mark and cut the teeth evenly . It is the edges which are radial to the circle that are important . It may be sufficient to merely glue a ratchet wheel to the end of its dowel , but the joint can be tightened by putting a saw cut across the dowel so a wedge can be tapped in as the joint is glued ( Fig. 6-26F ) . Trim the end level when the glue has set . The pawls ( Fig. 6-26G ) can be plywood or hardwood . The projecting pieces should fit against the radial teeth of the ratchet wheels and be given enough clearance to go easily into the spaces . Round the lever ends and drill the other ends for pivot screws . When the parts are assembled , locate each pawl where it can drop into the ratchet wheel and be lifted clear when the drum is to be reversed . Put washers between the handles and ratchet wheels and the sides of the control tower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts for painting . The cord that controls the jib angle should be only long enough to let the jib go out to about 30 degrees to the floor , so the user will not be troubled by the jib dropping out of control . He or she will then be able to wind it up to nearly vertical . Similarly , make the winding cable long enough to reach the floor when the jib is at its highest . It helps to have some weight at the hook , so it hangs down even when there is nothing on it . The hook can be bent from wire . A metal or plastic ball can be threaded on the cord above it as a weight . TIPPING TRUCK This toy is one that a young child can push along . A doll can sit in the driving seat . The back may be loaded with wooden blocks or other things . They will travel safely , but when the lever at the side 134 is pulled forward they will be shot out of the back on to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should withstand plenty of rough use . The general construction is with parts glued and nailed together ( Fig. 6-27 ) . The drawing gives an acceptable size ( Fig. 6-28 ) , but dimensions are not very critical and can be varied to suit available wood . If the base is made first , it can be used to mark out the sizes and positions of other parts ( Fig. 6-29A ) . The axles may be slightly longer than the width of the base to give clearance to the wheels . The engine and seat assemblies are attached to their upright parts and to the base . Round all exposed edges and corners . The back is just an open-ended box with a plywood bottom . At the forward end take the wood below the bottom to act as a stop for the tipper ( Fig. 6-29B ) . The hinge piece underneath should be no longer than the width of the vehicle base ( Fig. 6-29C ) to give clearance for the wheels . Round the rear corners and the top edges of the sides . The tipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crossbar should be the same total thickness as the hinge bar on the back , so the back sits level over the base ( Fig. 6-29D ) . Arrange the crossbar to extend far enough for the lever to be pulled when the plywood part of the tipper is central under the back . Glue a piece of dowel rod in a hole as the lever . Hinges can be quite small ; 1-inch or 1%-inch hinges should be satisfactory . Do not let them into the wood . Put two hinges between the hinge bar on the back and rear edge of the base . Put another pair on the tipper bar . Locate this on 135 the base far enough forward to only just clear the piece extending downwards as the lever is operated . Wheels should not be more than 3 inches in diameter . Other-wise , there may not be enough clearance for the rear ones . They can be wood , metal , or plastic . Mount them on long screws with washers on each side of a wheel . There can be a screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the youngster is more likely to want to crawl and push the truck . // This scooter is almost entirely of wood . It can be fitted with a small sidecar , so a doll or other toy can be transported . The design allows for wheels about 5 inches in diameter mounted on suitable iron rods as axles . Get the wheels and make the axles before starting on the woodwork , so the sizes can be adjusted if necessary . Before cutting any of the wood , set out the front bottom corner full-size so as to get the sizes right . The handle should come at about 80 degrees to the platform . Make the bracket that will carry the pivot with its grain following the longer direction ( Fig. 6-30A ) . At the bottom allow enough to project through the platform , so fillets can be glued in ( Fig. 6-30B ) to stiffen the joint . Make the platform ( Fig. 6-30C ) , notched at the 138 forward end to take the bracket , and cut away enough at the rear for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear end ( Fig. 6-30D ) . Drill through for the axle . Glue the bracket in place . Drive long screws or nails across it through the platform . Glue and nail fillets above the joint and add others below when you make the joint ( Fig. 6-30E ) . See that the bracket is kept square to the surface of the platform when viewed from the front . The upright handle is made in a very similar way to the platform , with the bottom cut away and thickened to take the wheel and axle ( Fig. 6-30F ) . At the top the best joint for adding the handlebar is a mortise and tenon ( Fig. 6-30G ) . Keep the handlebar square where it comes over the upright , but thoroughly round the projecting parts to form grips . The simplest form of pivot is made with four large screw eyes and a rod or piece of a large nail through them ( Fig. 6-30H ) . Another hinge can be made with two pieces of strip iron , about 1-inch by Y8-inch section , bent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 6-30J ) . A sidecar can not be very large , or it may interfere with the foot that kicks against the ground . A simple box with its bottom ex-tended is shown in Fig. 6-30K . Mount an axle with a block of wood underneath . At the edge next to the platform , bevel the underside to allow for tilting as the scooter is used . Attach the sidecar with two small T hinges . THREE-WHEEL SCOOTER This toy is intended for a small child who may have difficulty in balancing on a two-wheel scooter . The horse 's head should appeal to him or her . Some sizes depend on the choice of wheels , so get them before starting on the other parts . A diameter of about 6 inches is suitable , and they will probably have holes to suit % - inch iron rod . Choose close-grained hardwood for all the wooden parts . Softwoods will soon crack . 139 The part that will have to take the most load is the bracket between the platform and the handle ( Fig. 6-31A ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any angle between 75 and 85 degrees should be satisfactory . Notch the platform to take in the bracket ( Fig. 6-31B ) . Join these parts with long wood screws from opposite sides , as well as glue , and choose screws that will go right through the bracket into the wood at the opposite side . Enclose the rear axle in a slot in a block screwed under the platform ( Fig. 6-31C ) . For most wheels there can be washers and a cotter pin through a hole at each end of the axle ( Fig. 6-31D ) . The handle width has to suit the front wheel thickness . If the wheel is about 1 inch thick , the head and spacer can be made to suit . If the wheel is much thicker , the bottoms of the handle sides may have to be cut away ( Fig. 6-31E ) . The parts that make up the handle have to be arranged , so the platform will be level when the bracket is hinged to the spacer . There may have to be some experimenting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set it out first on paper and transfer this to the wood ( Fig. 6-31F ) . Round the edges , particularly at the top . Be careful to drill squarely for the handlebar . Put the parts temporarily together , with the side pieces clamped to the spacer and the head , and the front wheel in place ( Fig. 6-31G ) . Hold this against the bracket and move the spacer up or down if necessary to get the parts in the right position to bring the platform level . Glue and screw the parts together and fit the front wheel . The hinge is made up of stout screw eyes ( Fig. 6-31H ) , with a rod having bent ends or a bolt and nut . Note that the screw eyes on one part come between those on the other part to prevent move ment up or down . If the head is painted all over one color , the outlines may give a nice effect . It will be better to at least paint in eyes . There can be a painted harness or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toy that gives a toddler something to hold and push 140 while learning to walk . The child can sit astride it and either propel himself with his feet , or someone else can push him ( Fig. 6-32 ) . The main parts can be solid wood , thick plywood , or blockboard . Softwood can be suitable , but the head might be too 141 easily broken if it is common softwood . It is better in plywood , with two thicknesses glued together if necessary . The base is a plain piece with its corners rounded ( Fig. 6-33A ) . The seat is a similar piece , but with some hollowing at the sides ( Fig. 6-33B ) and a notch for the head . 142 Mark out the head with the aid of a pattern of squares ( Fig. 6-34A ) . The piece that projects through the seat can be plain and held by screws up through the crossbar , but a dovetail arrangement is ideal ( Fig. 6-34B ) . The head slides in from the front , and there can be one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 143 Put crossbars under the seat and base at the leg positions . Drill for the legs into the thinner top crossbars ( Fig. 6-33C ) and into the base . Be careful to cut all legs the same length . Glue them into place and check that the seat and base are parallel . Wooden wheels 3 or 4 inches in diameter are shown mounted on stout wood screws with washers on each side ( Fig. 6-33D ) . Other wheels can be used on axles and mounted as described for some other toys . Make sure the wheels have enough clearance on each side of the base . Some wheels may benefit by having the crossbars slightly overlong to keep the wheels away from the base . Before making and fitting the handle , upholster the top of the seat from the back to the head . This can be a piece of plastic or rubber foam about 1 inch thick and held with plastic-coated fabric . It helps in getting good rounded edges to shave off the underside of the foam edge with a knife , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Use large-headed upholstery nails to hold the covering down . The slope of the handle sides should be arranged carefully . They must be clear of the wheels at the base and cross the seat 144 forward of the curved corners . Put a piece of round rod through holes for the handle ( Fig. 6-33F ) . The head should be painted and may be fitted with a harness . You can paint on the harness . A mane can be made with rope strands . A tail can be a piece of frayed rope glued into a hole , although the toy will stand up to rough use better if left without these things . // Children 's hobby horses go back to classical Greek days . The simplest version had something to represent a horse 's head , which may have been just a bundle tied by the child . The head was attached to a stick . In many forms this merely dragged along the ground while the user walked astride it . The trailing end should run on wheels , and this example has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 6-35 ) . The head and the handle across it are the same as described for the three-wheel scooter . Mark the shape from the grid of squares ( Fig. 6-31F ) . Cut the shape and drill for the handle . Round the edges of the head 's outline . To make a strong joint , taper the part that will go into the shaft ( Fig. 6-35A ) . Make the shaft from a piece of round rod about 1 ? inches in diameter . Alternatively , start with a square strip and plane it octagonal . Then take the sharpness off the angles . Saw the top to match the taper of the head . Make the joint with glue and a few screws driven from opposite sides . Make sure the screwheads are sunk below the surface , as they come near the places where a child 's bare legs may rub . At the other end of the shaft , glue it into a hole in the wheel block , preferably with a wedge driven into a saw cut for extra security ( Fig. 6-35B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3 inches in diameter . Take care when assembling that the head is square with the wheel block when viewed from the end . Much of the appeal of a hobby horse is in its appearance . The shaft and the trailing end may be any bright color , but you can use your painting skill in making the head look lifelike . You can add a mane and reins . PUSH TRICYCLE This tricycle can be the first wheeled riding vehicle for a toddler . He sits astride and steers , but he propels himself by pushing with his feet against the ground . There can be a single front wheel , but the design is shown ( Fig. 6-36 ) with two close steering wheels . Sizes suit short legs . Even if the whole thing topples , the child does not fall very far ( Fig. 6-37 ) . Wheels about 4 inches in 146 diameter can be used , and these mount on a ? - inch rod axle . For other sizes the dimensions may have to be altered . Start by setting out the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the sizes and positions of other parts . Notice that the front projects rather more than a semicircle to increase strength the short way of the grain . Round the outline where the child 's legs may rub , then round the cross section everywhere . The pivot for steer ing is a piece of 1-inch dowel rod . Drill for this . A fairly close fit is advisable at this stage to allow for wear later . The back leg ( Fig. 6-38B ) is the same width as the top . The easiest way to make the bottom cutout is to drill holes for the curved corners and saw into them . Mark for the axle holes on both sides and drill carefully both ways to get the holes in line . The top edge of the back leg will be screwed to the seat . Make sure it is cut squarely for a close fit . The bracket ( Fig.6-38C ) is simple . It will be strongest with the grain diagonally . Round its exposed edges . The steering assembly is made of 2-inch square wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the handle , which is a length of dowel rod with its ends rounded ( Fig. 6-38D ) . The bottom part has a hole drilled across for the front axle ( Fig. 6 - 38E ) . Be tween the two parts comes a piece of 1-inch dowel rod ( Fig. 6 - 38F ) and a pad which serves as a washer to reduce wear ( Fig. 6-38G ) . Drill the upper part to fit over the dowel rod with a little to spare in the depth of the hole . Drill the part into which the rod will be glued . 147 Attach the back leg to the seat with glue and four 2-inch screws . Brace it with the bracket screwed both ways ( Fig.6-39A ) . The pad washer looks best if it is round ( Fig. 6-39B ) . If you do not have a lathe , it will be just as satisfactory if it is made octagonal . Drill it for the pivot , and glue and screw it to the top of the assembly 's bottom part . Glue the pivot rod into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 150 Glue the handle into the top part of the assembly . Make sure the end that will be upwards is rounded and smooth , as a child 's head may come against it in a fall . To put the parts together , pass the pivot rod up through the hole in the seat . Press the top part down tightly over it . Do not glue this part , but attach it with one or two screws ( Fig. 6-39D ) . If after much use there is wear around the hole in the seat , the screws can be removed . The parts can be pressed tighter before putting screws into different positions . Check that the axles will fit . Then paint the woodwork before adding the axles and wheels to complete construction . 151 Chapter 7 Toys Made on a lathe The spinning reel that depends on the smooth coiling and uncoiling of a string is not quite such a simple turning exercise as it may seem . The narrow groove must have a smooth interior , and it is not easy to make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to turn the two sides separately and join them with a short piece of dowel rod ( Fig. 7-1A ) . YO-YO Turning is best done on a screw center . Plane the sides of each piece that will be inwards . Cut the wood 4pproximately round and mount it on the screw center . There is no need for the screw to enter very far , and a plywood washer can be put behind the wood if the screw is very long ( Fig. 7-1B ) . Bring up the tailstock center to provide additional support while turning the wood round ( Fig. 7-1C ) , but withdraw it for turning the outside to shape . Round and sand what will be the edges of the groove . Deepen the center mark by cutting in with the point of a chisel ( Fig. 7-1D ) to provide a good starting place for the drill later . Remove that side and turn the other side to match . Use calipers and rule to check that parts are the same . Drill each piece squarely through the wood , preferably with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod , so the two sides are 3/16 inch to 1/a inch apart . DIABOLO Diabolo is a game or pastime that is at least 150 years old . It has 152 gone through periods of revival . The diabolo is held on a thin string between two long sticks or handles . One handle is held in each hand . It can then be rolled along the string , tossed into the air , caught again , and juggled in various ways . There have been many designs , but the essential arrangement is a round section with large diameters near the ends and a small neck between them . The neck runs on the string , and the large ends have a flywheel effect to make the toy spin . The handles can be just plain sticks , but you can make turned ones . The diabolo will often fall on the floor . It should be made of close-grained hardwood . Then it resists damage and is given weight ; light softwoods are unsatisfactory . Making a diabolo is a straightforward turning job . The only special requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape and weight . For the double cone type ( Fig. 7-2A ) , turn the 153 wood circular and have it overlong . Pencil the main parts while the wood is revolving , then turn the inner tapers first ( Fig. 7-2B ) . There can be double beads at the greatest diameter . Curve down the ends equally before parting off . Treat the other type ( Fig. 7-2C ) in a similar way to get it symmetrical . Diameters of either type are not critical , but the toy is easier to juggle with if it is fairly heavy . If you start with a greater diameter of 2 inches that should be about right . The handles can be pieces of ? - inch dowel rod or need not even be round . The string is knotted through holes drilled across the ends ( Fig. 7-2D ) . Turned handles are more sophisticated and will show your skill as a woodturner , but they do not make any difference in the performance of the diabolo . In the design shown ( Fig. 7-2E ) grips are shaped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string , drill along the end and make another small hole into it ( Fig. 7-2F ) . A piece of thin wire may be needed to pull the string through . If the side hole is slightly greater in diameter , it should be possible to bury the knot below the surface . SPINNING TOP This top makes an interesting lathe project , and the finished toy should provide plenty of fun for a child of any age ( Fig. 7-3 ) . A length of cord through the cross handle is wrapped with as many turns as possible tightly around the spool part of the top , which is then held to the ground with the other handle in the hole . The cross handle is pulled to spin the top . Once it is spinning , the central handle is withdrawn . Weight is an advantage in the top . It is best made of a closegrained hardwood . The peg at the bottom should be hard enough to withstand friction on the floor . It should be metal instead of wood . The handles can be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg of the handle , so the central hole should be drilled in the lathe while the wood is mounted for the other turning . Start with a piece of wood 1 inch or more longer than the final length , so the drill can run into it . Turn a cylinder and square its end at the tailstock ( Fig. 7-4A ) . Without changing the wood at the headstock and , mount a drill chuck in the tailstock . Drill far enough centrally to go through what will be the final length , although not far enough to hit the driving center or chuck ( Fig. 7-4B ) . This hole may be 5/16 inch to give good clearance on a ' /a-inch handle peg . Withdraw the drill at intervals to clear chips which may clog the drill flutes. 156 Replace the tailstock center and turn the top to shape . The reel for the cord should be parallel . The rim above it should be curved , so it will not snag the cord ( Fig. 7-4C ) . Finish the top except for parting off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be done later , but a good hardwood looks well if it is polished with wax . That can be done in the lathe . Part off the wood to complete the top . Make a peg 157 to go into the hole about 3/4 inch and project with a rounded end . Glue it in place . The cross handle can be just a piece of dowel rod drilled across its center , but it is shown shaped in the lathe ( Fig 7-3A ) . The cord needs to be tough and flexible . A piece of soft synthetic braided line would be suitable . The peg in the other handle is a piece of dowel rod . Taper its end ( Fig. 7-3B ) , so it is easy to insert in the top . The handle ( Fig. 7-3C ) is made like a handle for a file or other tool . Drill it in the lathe to keep the assembly concentric , and at the end that will come close 158 to the top turn a bead for minimum friction if the parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glue in the peg . Clean off any surplus glue around the joint before it hardens , so it can not interfere with free turning . The top should spin successfully the first timebut it may help to rub the peg with wax CUP AND BALL This is a toy with a long history . It was known as a bilboquet and was a popular amusement at the court of King Henry VIII . Many old examples have survived , and there are variations . Basically , there is a wooden ball on a cord and a cup on the end of a handle to which the cord is attached . With the handle in one hand and the ball hanging free , the toy is swung so the ball is tossed upwards . An attempt is made to catch it in the cup . Some cups were very shallow , and catching must have been difficult . The length of the cord also affects difficulty ; a piece 24 inches long is about right . In the example ( Fig. 7-5A ) the cup is deep and big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child will not be frustrated by a task that is too difficult . All of the work is done on a lathe with normal woodturning tools , except that forming the inside of the cup is most easily done with a scraping tool narrower than may be found in most tool kits . It can be made by grinding the end of a piece of steel rod about 1/a inch square to form a rounded cutting edge . There are many ways to form the handle . Turn the ball first , as its size will control the size of the cup . Drill a hole through the ball for the cord . Counterbore its end so the knot will come below the surface ( Fig. 7-5B ) . Mount the wood for the main part in the lathe , so that the cup is towards the tailstock . Turn the wood cylindrical and shape all the external surfaces . There should be enough wood left to provide strength at the end of the handle , so it will not break until it is parted off as almost the last cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup end will come with a parting tool or the edge of a chisel . Reduce the waste part diameter to 3/4 inch or less . This gives clearance to allow a narrow 159 gouge or scraping tool to start hollowing ( Fig. 7-5C ) . As cutting progresses , cut into the waste part to taper it . Be careful not to go too far , so as to cause the waste to break off before you have the cut shape satisfactory ( Fig. 7-5D ) . Remember to round the mouth of the cup before finishing the hollow . Go to the other end of the handle to reduce the thickness there . 160 Continue reducing the waste part inside the cup while shaping the curve . Check the inside diameter of the cup with inside calipers to see that it will take the ball easily . Cut toward the center until the waste piece breaks off . Saw off the end of the handle from the waste at the drive end . You will probably have to clean the inside of the cup , particularly near the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cord that is longer than you need . Knot it through the ball and tie it around the neck of the handle to try your skill . Knot or splice it permanently when you have discovered the length that gives the most satisfying game . This is not really a toy for painting in bright colors . If you have used attractive hardwood , it can be waxed . The wood can be sealed with a coat of varnish . WOBBLING DOG This pull-along toy ( Fig. 7-6 ) will please a young child . It 161 makes an interesting project for anyone with a small lathe . Use a close-grained hardwood , so it is easy to get a good finish and to resist knocks which the toy will inevitably get . Start by making the body . Turn all the parts in one length . Turn the wood into a parallel piece , then mark the body parts with enough between for the parting tool to enter ( Fig. 7-7A ) . Square the end toward the tailstock , but leave some waste wood at the headstock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far at this stage . Try to get the five parts identical by doing the same tool work to each in turn before moving on to the next stage . Round the tops ( Fig. 7-7B ) , then slightly taper the parting tool cuts and remove sharpness from the rims ( Fig. 7-7C ) . Clean all the parts within reach with abrasive paper . The parts will be strung on a fiber or rubber cord . There has to be a hole through each piece to take the cord . If you have a long drill that can be mounted in a tailstock chuck , use it to drill through ( Fig. 7-7D ) . Otherwise , the holes can be drilled as separate sections , after they have been removed from the lathe . Take the parting tool 162 in further at each division , but it is unwise to try to part off completely . This will result in the wood breaking and possibly becoming damaged . Instead , saw the sections apart on the bench and smooth the meeting surfaces . The head is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on the end of the same strip of wood , but excessive length in the lathe may give trouble with bending at the parting tool cuts . Turn it on the end of a longer piece ( Fig. 7-7E ) . Other animal heads may be turned or carved , but the toy is not intended to be very lifelike . The head is attached to the front body section with a piece of Y4-inch dowel rod . The ears are fitted into ' - inch holes . Drill for these parts . There is no need to be absolutely symmetrical . The head will probably look better tilted back and to one side . Turn the ears ( Fig. 7-7F ) and tail ( Fig. 7-7G ) . Glue them in place . The eyes may be round head nails , but a better type is sold for making dolls . They glue in place and will alter direction when the toy is moved . If the end sections have their holes counterbored ( Fig. 7-7H ) , knots in the joining cord can be hidden . Turn the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar way to the body parts . They are shown with the screw holes drilled centrally . If the holes are drilled slightly off-center , the dog will wobble up and down and flex sideways as it is pulled along . The axles are square strips . Notch the end body sections to take them ( Fig. 7-8B ) . Use round head wood screws and washers to attach the wheels ( Fig. 7-8C ) . Candle fat or a pencil rubbed on the screw necks , as they are inserted , will lubricate the wheels enough without being messy . Put a screw eye in the front section for a pulling cord . There can be just a loop in the end of the cord , or it can be knotted through a piece of dowel rod . If you are using a lathe for all the other parts , a turned handle ( Fig. 7-8D ) is appropriate . Paint all the parts before assembly and before adding the eyes . You can simulate mouth and nostrils with paint , but just a general brightness seems more appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair ( Fig. 7-9A ) is shown with turned parts . It can be made with wood of square section , but turning the wood gives a lighter assembly and provides an interesting exercise for anyone with a lathe . The sizes shown allow a girl to attend to her doll while standing alongside the chair ( Fig. 7-10 ) . The flap height comes near the height of a normal table , so it is possible for the child to have the chair nearby when sitting at a table for a meal . The seat and flap are plywood , but for strong joints in the other parts it is advisable to use a close-grained hardwood . As in the making of ordinary full-size furniture , some of the joints do not have very large glue areas . Good fits in close-grained wood ensure maximum strength . If the sizes are altered , keep both the seat and the spread of the legs square for simplicity in construction . It is also important that the chair back and the inner edges of the arms are parallel , so the flap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the back and hang at the rear . Make the turned parts first . Make the four legs identical ( Fig. 7-11A ) . If there are slight variations in the curves , that may not matter . Get the overall lengths the same . The positions of the lines around the parallel parts should match , as these indicate where the rails and footrest come . Holes in the seat may be % inch , but use the 164 chosen drill on a piece of scrap wood . Turn the tops of the legs to fit that hole . The four lower rails ( Fig. 7-11B ) should have their ends turned to fit V2-inch holes . Be careful to get the beads central . A marked strip of wood to hold against the wood in the lathe when turning will help , as it can be reversed for checking . 165 The two arm supports ( Fig. 7-11C ) are made like the rails . The lower ends go through the seat , but the tops must be trimmed later . Make the seat ( Fig. 7-9B ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the legs on the underside , but do not drill yet . Mark the positions of the holes for the arm supports to clear them . Make a full-size drawing of a side view of the seat , two legs , and a rail ? using just their centerlines ? to get the angles for drilling holes . You may get the same results by laying the parts 166 down in the correct relationship to each other . Use an adjustable bevel set to the angles as a guide when drilling the holes . To get the spacing of the holes for the rails , wrap a piece of paper around the line where the holes come and mark its overlap . Remove it and divide the distance between the overlap marks into four . Use the adjustable bevel as a guide to the drill angle and let the holes run 167 into each other . At the footrest level , put slots in two legs to suit the plywood thickness ( Fig. 7-11D ) . Drill the holes in the seat for the legs . Make a trial assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends of the rails , so they clear each other inside the meeting holes . Make the footrest of a length to fit into the slots in the front legs . Round its corners and edges . Make the sides of the back ( Fig. 7-9C ) and the crossbar between them . At the bottoms of the sides , make tenon joints to clear the leg holes ( Fig. 7-9D ) , with the sides 5 ? inches apart . The arms have rounded fronts and tapered backs , so they can be tenoned into the sides ( Fig. 7-9E ) . Drill for the arm supports in the seat and the arms . Note that the supports will slope outwards slightly as well as forward . When you are satisfied that all the parts are prepared , assem ble the legs and rails with the seat and footrest . Check that the assembly is symmetrical . Stand it on a level surface and view it from all four directions , so you can make adjustments before the glue has set . Trim the ends of the leg tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that come above the seat . Make the flap to match the actual sizes . Its sides must rest on the arms . The tray must have sufficient clearance to swing over the back , pivoting on two screws ( Fig. 7-11E ) . Let the plywood tray in flush with the flap sides . The best joint at the front corners is a dovetail ( Fig. 7-11F ) . Use round head screws as pivots . Put thin washers under the heads and in the joints , so the flap does not rub as it is moved . Make sure all sharp edges are removed . Clean off any excess glue , then refinish all of the wood with paint or varnish . // This is a balancing toy that was first made a long time ago in the East . It is not so much a toy to play with as one to watch . When the balancing man is given a push , he will sway from side to side and turn on his platform for a long time . A baby may be fascinated by the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to 169 operate the toy , or it can serve as a moving decoration on a table or shelf . A figure may be carved to have a more lifelike appearance , but as shown ( Fig. 7-12A ) it is in the usual form turned on a lathe . Turn it between centers ( Fig. 7-13A ) . Allow some waste at the tailstock end as well as the usual piece at the other end . The foot has to be finished smooth and rounded and should not include a hole left from the tailstock center . Do some hand sanding there , if necessary , after you remove the wood from the lathe . The balancing arm is a piece of stiff wire that will not buckle after it has been shaped . It can be hard brass , mild steel , or stainless steel . Thickness is not critical , but somewhere between 1/16-inch and 1/8-inch diameter should be suitable . Draw a curve with a radius of 7 inches on a piece of scrap plywood . Use that as a guide to bend the wire by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waist of the figure to take the wire . Some traditional examples have the wire through the arms only , held forward of the body . Other examples have the arms pivoted at the shoulders , so their angle can be altered and the figure allowed different postures . Make the arms from pieces of wood about ? - inch by 1/s-inch section . Plane off the sides of the body to take them ( Fig. 7-13B ) and make their lengths suitable to take the wire . Shape the arms to the shoulders after they have been glued on . Turn two balls about 11V4-inch diameter as weights . Fit the balancing wire through the body and into holes in the balls with epoxy glue . The stand ( Fig. 7-12C ) should be high enough for the balancing balls to clear the table when they swing low . It is shown with three legs . The figure will swing and rotate on a plain top with surprisingly few falls , but it will help if the platform is turned with a slight rim ( Fig. 7-13C ) . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divide this into three for the leg positions ( Fig. 7-13D ) . How much the legs flare out is not so important as getting the slope the same on all three ( Fig. 7-13E ) . Draw this angle as a guide for drilling the holes for the legs . Either pack up the wood on a drill press or use an adjustable bevel as a guide for freehand drilling . Legs could be turned , but %-inch dowel rods are suitable . Circus performers and babies like bright colors . Paint the head with some semblance of hair and features if you wish , then use bright paint for other parts of the toy . The bottom of the man and the top surface of the platform may be better left plain or polished to reduce friction and allow the toy to keep moving as long as possible . 170 // This is a traditional type of turned wooden baby 's rattle . When shaken , the two rings slide to hit the stops and make a noise . As a turning exercise , it presents the interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood . The sizes shown should be satisfactory ( Fig. 7-14A ) , with a grip to suit small hands and an end too big to push far into a mouth . Both for convenience in turning and for strength , the wood chosen should be hard and close-grained . The rings will be weak in 172 other woods . They either will not stand up to turning or will break in use . The general outline is a straightforward turning job , with the wood mounted between the lathe centers . Turn it cylindrical . Deal with the rings before doing much to other parts , although they can be roughed to shape . If you finish all the other parts and then make a mistake with your first attempt at turning the rings , you will have wasted that much effort . Pencil lines around each section with a ring ( Fig. 7-14B ) . Turn down to near the final size of the necks on which the rings will slide ( Fig. 7-14C ) . Leave the lower corners lightly rounded . Be careful not to take anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cutaway and the top of the ring ( Fig. 7-14D ) . With the point of a narrow chisel , start cutting the inside of the ring ( Fig. 7-14E ) . Concentrate on the ring section . Be careful not to cut into the neck , but otherwise the waste wood left there does not matter at this stage . Cut in a little at each side until your cuts meet , and the ring is separated from the neck ( Fig. 7-14F ) . If you have been careful with tool work , there should be no need for sanding the ring . If you think sanding is necessary , do this just before cutting right through . With the ring to one side , turn the center of the neck level ( Fig. 7-14G ) . Turn the other parts of the rattle to shape after cutting both rings . Be careful that the loose rings do not catch in a tool and become damaged . A ring can be held to one end of its space with adhesive tape , out of the way while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the second end . If a suitable clean wood is chosen , there will probably be no need for paint or varnish . One way of safely sealing the grain is to rub it with a vegetable oil , such as salad oil , to finish with a slight sheen . 173 Games and Puzzles This is an educational toy for the youngest child who is just learning to use his hands . The pegs are driven through holes with a mallet , but they touch the floor before falling out . The toy can be turned over for them to be driven back . Saw cuts across the pegs provide slight springiness to help enter the pegs in the Boles and pull them out . HAMMER AND PEG GAME Sizes need to be large enough to give stability , yet not so big as to be heavy for the child to handle . Those shown ( Fig. 8-1 ) should be satisfactory . The main frame ( Fig. 8-1A ) has square ends . The part with holes can be simply nailed between the ends , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is better to cut shallow trenches across the ends ( Fig. 8-1B ) , so the parts are joined with glue and screws from outside . The pegs are four pieces of dowel rod , or they can be turned on a lathe ( Fig. 8-1C ) . Saw across the ends at right angles to each other and let the saw cuts come within about / inch of each other at the center . Round the ends slightly . The hole size should be such that a peg will drive in without too much effort , yet not be so large that the peg slips through . Pegs may have to be sanded to get the fit right . Allow for paint thickening the pegs slightly . The mallet ( Fig. 8-1D ) is made from a piece of Y2-inch dowel rod as a handle , glued into a hole in a thicker cylindrical piece for a head . If the hole has to be made without the aid of a drill press , get an assistant to sight the direction of the drill , so it goes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not excessively , as the main frame must stand level . Round the end of the mallet handle . If a bought rubber or plastic mallet or hammer is used , its face will be about twice the diameter of the pegs or , if smaller , a child may have difficulty in hitting accurately . The toy can be expected to get some hard use , so there is little point in giving it a high gloss finish . Bright colors will make it more appealing . // This is a simple type of jigsaw puzzle where it is possible to assemble the parts in several ways to produce regular geometric forms . Any oddment of thin plywood can be used . If the lines are cut with a fine circular saw or a backsaw with fine teeth , there will be no need to do any more than sand off roughness . Leave the parts still to size with just enough clearance between them . Cuts must be accu rate . If your first attempt goes wrong , you have not wasted much effort if you have to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8-3A ) including the internal lines . The shapes are numbered for identification in showing the other assemblies , but putting the parts together becomes more puzzling if there are no numbers . As can be seen ( Fig. 8-3B ) , at least five geometric shapes are possible . Check that your parts will assemble properly . Sand off numbers if you have used them . For younger users the outlines of possible shapes , but not the internal lines , can be drawn on a piece of plywood as guides to layout . 179
