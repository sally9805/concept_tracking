Putting all of America 's MX eggs in one basket seems to defy common sense . But there is a certain logic to Dense Pack that can only be understood in terms of the strange and fearsome technology involved . The closer the Soviet missiles come to the 21-sq. - mi . Wyoming strip , the closer they come to each other . When the first finally explodes just above its target , its apocalyptic power is turned against fellow Soviet missiles . Its blast , and those of any succeeding warheads that manage to detonate , would cause mutual missile annihilation known in the lexicon of strategic warfare as Fratricide . <P> The initial Soviet H-bombs would create powerful shock waves ( throwing warhead guidance systems off course ) , searing temperatures ( high enough on the periphery of the fireball to incinerate other warheads ) and a flood of radiation ( highenergy gamma and X rays , plus neutrons , which would wreck a warhead 's electronics ) . The blast would also produce the deadly vacuum characteristic of all thermonuclear explosions , destroying almost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its maneuvering ability . Any warheads surviving these multiple perils would probably be burned up by frictional heat as they plunged earthward at more than 5,000 m.p.h. through dust and debris . Under its worst-case scenario , the Pentagon figures at least 70 of the MXs would survive in their superhardened silos . <P> The underground communications centers , housing the vital electronics for firing and controlling the MXs , would be similarly shielded , relying on fiber optics and lasers rather than conventional wiring to resist the devastating effects on electrical circuits known as electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) from nuclear blasts . To clear the way for the missiles , giant , hydraulically powered blades would rise out of the silos and sweep away obstructing rubble . Once launched , the MXs would be traveling much slower than the incoming Soviet missiles . Thus , as they rose through the cloud of dust and debris , the buildup of heat on their exteriors would not be disabling . Says Under Secretary of Defense Richard DeLauer : " We can fly the MX out before he the Soviets can fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pack may seem in the Pentagon 's hard sell , many scientists believe it is fatally flawed . Says IBM Physicist Richard Garwin : " Fratricide may well be true , but it is irrelevant because it can be defeated . " The Soviets , for example , could avoid Fratricide by dropping a single warhead at a time , beginning with the southern end of the Wyoming strip , at a rate of one every 20 to 40 sec . Strategists call such a barrage Slow Walk . The Pentagon says that the first detonations would leave so many particles in the atmosphere that the incoming warheads would still burn up before they could do any damage . <P> The Soviets might resort to another ploy known as Pindown . By repeatedly exploding missiles high above the silos for several hours , they would create a blanket of floating debris , thermal shocks and high radiation that would keep the American missiles trapped in their silos . But the Pentagon replies that even if Pindown worked , which it doubts , the MXs could eventually be launched .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
