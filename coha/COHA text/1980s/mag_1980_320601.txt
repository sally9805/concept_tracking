Kennedy goes out in style-and looks ahead <P> THE ALSO-RAN . Winning isn ' t everything ; it 's the only thing , said Vince Lombardi . But sometimes nothing so becomes a candidate 's run for the Oval Office as the manner in which he bows out . Sport and politics share the inevitability that someone must lose - but also the redemption that there is almost always a tomorrow . <P> <P> The great resonant voice rumbled from the podium and through the arena , capturing the full attention of the thousands of Democrats below . The curly , graying head bobbed in acknowledgment to the cheers from his listeners . Ted Kennedy 's roar , once strangely uncertain , now clearly had become a force to move a multitude 's emotions . The youngest of the Kennedy brothers , for so long during this campaign at odds with himself , seemed to have found a kind of peace . He quoted some lines from Tennyson 's Ulysses : <P> I am a part of all that I have met ... Tho'much is taken , much abides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heroic hearts ... strong in will To strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield . <P> Throughout the convention hall , tears filled many eyes . For Democrats who lived through the 1960s , this was a final chapter , both for Kennedy 's quest for the nomination and for the social and political cause that he embodied . His speech may have been the last great liberal call to arms . To some it seemed impractical and out of tune with the country 's needs and wants . It spoke to what once was and is no longer . But even many of those among his listeners who never admired Kennedy or his brothers may miss the sense of strength and certainty and hope that the family represented . Thus , in counterpoint to his ringing words , there was a sadness for many on the convention floor for what might have been , for a political party that has had to change direction , to find new answers and perhaps even a new purpose . <P> After the speech , Madison Square Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o another run at the presidency . His supporters were convinced that he has learned Sand matured from the bruising 1980 fight and that he is the natural heir to the Democratic nomination in 1984 . <P> His performance last week makes that possible , but far from certain . In losing the nomination , he punctured the myth of Kennedy invincibility and thus opened the way for campaigns by other Democrats like Vice President Walter Mondale , Senator Gary Hart of Colorado , Governor Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia . Some of these men are further along in reshaping a new Democratic approach to government than is Ted Kennedy . <P> His campaign may have been , in the words of his friend , former Senator John Tunney of California , " a campaign of atonement . " Said Tunney : " That campaign and that speech spell the end of the Chappaquiddick era . It is something that had to be done . " But the reception of Kennedy 's speech last week inevitably raises the question of whether the 1984 Ted Kennedy will be the Ted that America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificently on the convention podium . All year the irony has been that the further Kennedy seemed from the nomination , the better he performed and was received by the voters . There seemed to be some form of liberation in losing .
