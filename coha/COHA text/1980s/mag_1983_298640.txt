The Kremlin tries for high-and dry-economic growth <P> A Soviet woman who is freezing in her new apartment discovers that shreds from a quilted workman 's jacket and some cigarette butts have been stuffed into the walls instead of insulation . A laborer falls from scaffolding because someone has , in exchange for a bottle of vodka , sold the wooden planks that he should be standing on and replaced them with rotting boards . A drunkard who is supposed to be demoted for causing an uproar in the factory holds on to his job because the boss fears he might walk out and leave the place understaffed . <P> Ever since Communist Party Chief Yuri Andropov started his campaign against " shoddy work , inactivity and irresponsibility " after coming to power last November , the Soviet press has published countless such examples of what he had in mind . Last week the Kremlin stepped up the offensive by announcing measures aimed at combatting the twin evils of absenteeism and alcoholism . <P> Under the new rules , workers who are away from their jobs without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day they play hooky . If they miss more than three hours of work , it will be treated as a full day 's absence . The penalties for overindulging in vodka are just as harsh . Anyone found drunk on the job may be summarily fired and will have to pay for damaged goods or lost production . Describing the new decrees , the party daily Pravda blamed not only workers but also managers who did not " set an example of discipline , proper organization of their work , or full use of their working time .

Interior Minister Vitali Fedorchuk announced that some of the country 's men in gray were being purged because they were " immature in an ideological and moral way . " There had been complaints from Soviet citizens , he said , concerning " late reaction to hooliganism and theft , and time lags in investigating crimes .

" <P> Andropov has already tried a variety of tactics to halt the economic stagnation that had set in during the last years of Leonid Brezhnev 's rule . The results have been mixed . Soviet national income has grown at the rate of 4% this year , compared with 2.9% in 1982 . Andropov can also take heart from what is expected to be the best grain harvest since 1978 . According to U.S. analysts , the yield may reach 200 to 210 million metric tons , well above the average of 177 million metric tons over the past four years . Still , the Soviet Union will not solve its economic troubles by cracking down on drunks and trusting in the weather .
