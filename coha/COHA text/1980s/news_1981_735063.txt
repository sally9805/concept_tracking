txt POLO FANS NEVER will have to worry about a players ' strike . From New Zealand to Argentina to India to Oak Brook , virtually all outstanding players have a common characteristic they 're independently and inordinately wealthy . Yet these men for whom money is no object play a demanding , dangerous game with a passion that is alien to many of the pampered and coddled baseball free-agents . Polo players are driven athletes , and the foregoing adjective takes in much more than the chauffeur . The players themselves have a tendency to downplay the human element in what some have called " hockey on horseback . " They tell the story of the top-rated Argentine player offered a blank check for his two best ponies by a wealthy young foreigner . The Argentine handed back the check and said : " My friend , if I lose those ponies , I lose my rating . " One of the world 's top-rated players is Red Armour , a Texan whose family fortune was amassed in the meat-packing industry . " Tile novelty of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Armour . " They say one great horse cornea along in a lifetime . I had one , Buena Suede . I brought him up in 1974 and had him for almost six years when I retired him . I know I 'll never ride as good again , " ARMOUR IS RIDING at Oak Brook In conjunction with Chicago 's Festival of the Equine , which will be climaxed by Sunday 's inaugural running of the Arlington Million , the world 's richest thoroughbred race . Armour is playing for Milwaukee in a four-team tournament that will ends Wednesday afternoon . ( Milwaukee will play Rolex-Abercrombie , and Kent in the 3 p.m. championship contest and Twelve Oaks will meet Hyatt-Oak Brook in the consolation game at 1 p.m . Also scheduled as part of the Festival is en international All-Star polo game Friday at 3 p.m. in which a U.S. team will meet a side consisting of a Kenyan , an Argentine , a Mexican , and an Englishman . ) " Thanks to the horse , if you stay basically healthy you can play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ile 's 75 per cent of your game , maybe more . " By thoroughbred racing standards , the horses are low-priced . A good one will sell for 510,000 and 523,000 is about as high as a player will go to improve his game by incorporating an outstanding horse into his repertoire . Some of the ponies are reformed racehorses but most became polo specialists at the outset of their athletic careers . Unlike thoroughbreds , unless they 're extraordinary , they usually do n't start competing until they 're mature . " THE GENERAL RANGE Is from five to nine yearg , " said Armour . " A horse does n't develop physically and mentally until then . As they get more training and game experience , they tend to becomebetter players . Some love the game ; others hate it and if a horse hates it you might as well get rid of him . " To get a horse ready you 'll have to work him six days per week for about two years . Then , whey he knows basically what is going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get him game-fit . In Argentina they 're breeding horses especially for polo . There it 's a national sport ? soccer is No. 1 and polo is No. 2 . The players have more finesse down there . It stands to reason ; the more you play against outstanding players the more finesse you acquire in the fine points of the game such as passing and setting up plays . Long before the appearance of cinematic sexpot Derek , in polo a " 10 " was the greatest . However , the phrase " 10-goal player " does n't mean a player averages 10 goals a game . It 's simply a means of evaluation . A 40-goal team ( every player is a 10 ) would be the ultimate . The teams in the Oak Brook tournament are in the 12-18 range . Oak Brook is one of this country 's three major facilities ? the others are Royal Palm Polo and Country Club in Boca Raton , Fla. , and Palm Beach Polo and Country Club . Another hotbed is San Antonio .

" This amount is a combination of the prize money from matches and the money he makes by training ponies for other people . " Ylvisaker is one of the patron saints of the attempt to broaden polo 's participation and spectator base so that it becomes a U.S. sport for not only The Elite but Everyman . In 1975 he started development of the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club , a 1,650 acre facility that includes nine polo fields , two practice fields , stables for 226 horses , and a polo school . At the school a neophyte for $100 can learn the sport on a mechanical pony that trundles up and down the field . Ylvisaker also initiated this country 's premier tournament , the Gould Cup match , at Oak Brook in 1976 . That year the purse was $25,200 . Now , the polo capital of the U.S. is his Florida showcase and the , top tournament ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse of $150,000 last April . The biggest change in polo in the last five years is the advent of extensive sponsorship , made possible in part by coverage of matches on cable-TV by the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network . , Polo has become a vehicle for advertising . The current matches in Oak Brook , for example , are being sponsored by Michelob and Roles ; Abercrombie , and Kent . Still , pOlo has light years to go before it becomes a sport of the masses .
