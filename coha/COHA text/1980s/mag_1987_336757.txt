His round face and ready grin make Attorney General Edwin Meese often appear almost cherubic . Not even his harshest critics see him as mean or even unfriendly . Yet Meese is a highly disorganized public official , seemingly oblivious to ethics and reckless in the handling of his modest personal finances . He is now Ronald Reagan 's only California confidant left in the Cabinet , but he has been a continual embarrassment to the Administration . Last week it was apparent that his ill-considered advice to the President had been disastrously wrong once again . <P> It was Meese who bulldozed past the cautions of Chief of Staff Howard Baker and persuaded Reagan to nominate Judge Douglas Ginsburg to the Supreme Court without a full probe of his background . Ginsburg 's conservative credentials were all that seemed to matter . " If Meese was going to push Ginsburg as ardently as he did , " says Bruce Fein of the conservative Heritage Foundation , " he should have done his homework . " Said a former associate : " He never learns . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutiny himself . He spent parts of three days last week in a federal courtroom where yet a second independent counsel and a grand jury are weighing possible criminal charges against him . Normally Attorneys General are on the prosecution , rather than the defense , side of such courtroom scenes . The jury is looking into Meese 's intervention in behalf of the Wedtech Corp. , a scandal-ridden New York City defense contractor that won $32 million in military contracts before going bankrupt . Some 20 people have faced charges for their activities with the company . <P> After his aide set up a White House meeting that led to an Army contract for Wedtech , Meese invested $50,000 with a San Francisco financial adviser who turned out to be a member of Wedtech 's board . The investment earned $35,000 in 19 months . Independent Counsel James McKay is presumably trying to determine whether the arrangement could have been an indirect payoff for Meese 's help to the company . The probe carries echoes of an investigation that delayed Meese 's confirmation as Attorney General for six months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Independent Counsel Jacob Stein , who studied the appointment to federal jobs of several individuals who had helped Meese get bank loans and sell his California house . <P> Last week Meese became embroiled in still another ethical controversy , this one triggered by his wife Ursula . She admitted to the New York Times that in June she wrote to Federal Judge R. Allan Edgar of Chattanooga to plead for a lenient sentence for a family friend . Joe S. Duncan , the son of Tennessee Republican Congressman John J. Duncan , had been convicted of filing a false federal income tax return in 1982 . The Justice Department had urged the judge to sentence Duncan to three years in prison . Edgar imposed the sentence but suspended all except six months of the term . <P> Mrs. Meese had invoked her husband 's name , writing , " My husband , Ed , and I consider Mr. Duncan to be an outstanding , conscientious and sensitive young man . . . We feel that ( ( he ) ) should be given very favorable consideration . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sent it , Mrs. Meese told the Times , but when she did , he raised no objection .
