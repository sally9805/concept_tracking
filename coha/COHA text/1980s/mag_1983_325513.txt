Lower interest rates give ailing thrifts a badly needed lift <P> " We 're making money for the first time since June of 1981 . It 's so wonderful to look through rose-colored glasses again . " <P> That kind of talk , coming in this case from Melissa Keleher , vice president of Home Federal Savings &; Loan Association in San Diego ( assets : $6 million ) , has not been heard much around the thrift industry during the past three years . Caught in a squeeze between high interest rates and longterm , fixed-interest mortgages , thrift institutions became candidates for the endangered-species list . The number of thrifts has shrunk nearly 20% since 1979 , as failing institutions have been merged into stronger ones ( see chart ) . As a whole , the thrifts lost $8.9 billion in 1981 and 1982 . Says James Carter , a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch : " If the hemorrhaging of the thrifts had continued at last year 's pace , their equity would have been drained away in three or four years . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new deposits , the thrift industry is beginning to revive . San Diego 's Home Federal , for example , lost $33.9 million in 1982 , but it had a $4.4 million profit in the first quarter , and the outlook for the rest of the year is good . <P> Wall Street has become enthusiastic about the industry , which consists of both S and Ls and savings banks . Prices of some S-and-L stocks have more than tripled in the past year . The big gainers include a pair of Beverly Hills thrifts : Great Western Financial Corp . ( assets : $12.8 billion ) , whose shares have climbed 172% since May , and First Charter Financial Corp . ( assets : $9.4 billion ) , up 233% during the same period . <P> The new financial supermarkets , meanwhile , have been eyeing thrifts as possible additions to their growing line of services . Merrill Lynch and Shearson/ American Express are each in the process of buying a thrift . Stockholders of Newport Balboa Savings Association ( assets : $65.2 million ) in Southern California are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $13.5 million , or $65 a share . The deal , which is subject to regulatory approval , would be a bonanza for Newport Balboa owners , who paid $12.50 a share when the stock was first issued in 1978 . <P> The recent drop in interest rates has been the biggest single reason for the resurgence of the thrifts . As a result of that decline , the institutions are now able to attract deposit money with much lower interest rates . A year ago , they had to offer 12% or more interest on certificates of deposit to compete with the popular money-market funds . Now they are paying an average of only 8.5% on their own money-market accounts , which they have been offering since last December . <P> While cash was flowing out of S and Ls at a steady rate last year , it is currently flowing in . Some $142 billion has gone into the new money-market accounts . In addition , some $12 billion in Individual Retirement Account funds has been deposited in the thrifts in the past six months .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
