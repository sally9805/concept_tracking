Dear Abby : Our son is getting married in September . When " Evelyn , " the bride ' s mother , called to tell me of the wedding plans , I was floored ! They are having the reception at the most expensive hall in Boston . Abby , these are young kids who have nothing . I was informed that our share would be $4 , 500 . I told Evelyn we didn ' t have that kind of money , that $1 , 000 was our limit . She hung up on me . I called a few days later and asked how many guests we could invite to the reception . " For $1 , 000 , " she said , " one couple . " I was furious and went right to her house to talk to her . She said I was living in the dark ages if I thought the parents of the bride still paid for the whole wedding with no help from the groom ' s side . She repeated , our share was $4 , 500 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ' t afford are four-flushers . " Then the father of the bride threw me out of the house ! Now there ' s bad feeling on both sides . Should we make a loan ? Mad in Massachusetts Dear Mad : No . The parents of the bride should have had a meeting with you before they planned a wedding that was beyond their means . Having committed for it , they have no right to " bill " you . They may have to make a loan , which will be their problem , not yours . Dear Abby : I am a high school dropout , but few people know it because my verbal skills are very good . I have a fairly good job , but I want to go to college . How does a high school dropout get into a college ? Someone suggested I look into the " G.E.D. " program . What is it ? I was ashamed to ask . Thanks for any help you can give me . Ohio Dropout Dear Dropout : " G.E.D. " stand for General Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask when and where to take the G.E.D. test . It is designed for people such as you .

Good luck , and thanks for asking because this information is valuable to many other readers . Dear Abby : My 16-year-old son wrote a letter to his grandparents who live in California . It wasn ' t a routine " thank-you " letter , but a spontaneous , friendly " keep-in-touch " letter . Yesterday he received a response from my mother . When he showed it to me , I was furious ! She had corrected three misspelled words , explaining in a footnote that she did it out of " loving concern . " My son just shrugged his shoulders , but I am angry . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates an " A " for good intentions , but an " F " for tact and diplomacy . Tell her that out of " loving concern " for her grandson ' s feelings , in the future she should resist the temptation to correct his letters .
