Tracing such international capital movements , many of which are not officially recorded , is inherently imprecise . But conversations with analysts familiar with the situation indicate that even the richest members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have begun to take steps to deal with what has become a worsening financial pinch . OPEC oil production , the bulk of which is exported , tumbled 18. 7 percent last year , after a 15. 7 percent decline in 1981 , and prices declined. // This week , probably on Wednesday , the Treasury Department is to disclose figures that are expected by bankers and others to show that investments of Middle East producers in the United States declined in the fourth quarter of last year . These holdings have risen by at least $6 billion every year but one since 1974 ; the exception was 1978 , when an extended period of price stability preceding the Iranian revolution led to a decline of $1. 48 billion. // The Treasury compilation does not include the first two months of 1983 , a period in which the declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerated. // One analyst of OPEC money flows , who declined to be identified , said the latest Treasury figures would almost certainly reflect a modest drawing down of oil producers ' foreign assets . But he added , " I would expect the bulk of the declines to be in the future. " // A tabulation by Chemical Bank indicated that OPEC investments in Western economies fell to $340 billion at the end of last year from $354 billion in December 1981. // The oil exporters also have substantial assets in London and other financial centers , but it does not appear that the drawdowns in the United States are being reinvested elsewhere . In fact , there is evidence that European banks are experiencing withdrawals by the poorer producers . <> <> Evidence of Squeeze // In addition to this week ' s report that is expected to show a drop in Middle East investment in the United States , there is considerable other evidence of the financial squeeze on oil-exporting countries. // OPEC had total oil revenues of about $200 billion last year . But it has estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each $1 cut in the price of a barrel of oil. // Saudi Arabia is said by a number of sources to have slowed or stopped , at least temporarily , payments for work on numerous construction and other development projects in the kingdom. // " There are American vendors who aren ' t getting paid , " said G. Henry M. Schuler , a former oil executive now at Georgetown University ' s Center for Strategic and International Studies . Corporations that have contracts with Saudi Arabia were unwilling to acknowledge this directly , but a former United States diplomat who visited Saudi Arabia in late January said last week : " American companies are concerned. " // It also appears that recent declines in the price of gold are related to securities sales - or the fear of them - by oil-producing countries , according to Thomas D. Thomson , senior vice president of Crocker Bank. // " There ' s a feeling they might try to cash in , " he said . " The market tends to anticipate these things . " Although direct investments such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdings in this country , some of these seem to be in the process of liquidation as well . <> <> Poorer ' Members Problems // Since OPEC is the residual world supplier - its oil is the first to be shunned when demand falls and the last to be bought when demand picks up - the slump has already caused severe distress for some poorer members . Nigeria and Venezuela , for example , have serious problems with international debts . Ecuador has virtually halted oil output for lack of markets. // This has led an OPEC advisory group to raise the possibility of establishing what it called a safety net . " The most vulnerable members must be protected from the effects of an intolerable fall in revenues by some device , financial or otherwise , put in place by the rest of OPEC , " the panel said in a December report . Overall , OPEC had a balance of payments deficit of about $9. 5 billion last year. // Now , in light of demand so slack that United States imports have plunged 25 percent , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 10 weeks , the financial adversity seems to be spreading. // Bankers and Government officials insist , however , that there is no significant risk that the oil producers with huge overseas assets will be forced to take drastic action . They note that much more than half of the $80 billion in assets that Mideast oil exporters hold in the United States are Government securities for which there is a large and ready market . <> <> Adjusting to Drop in Revenues // Nonetheless , even Saudi Arabia , the dominant OPEC producer and the holder of by far the biggest overseas reserves , has been taking steps to adjust to lower oil revenues. // Ahmed al-Malik , head of the foreign section of the Saudi Arabia Monetary Agency , said late last year that the agency had begun to move its portfolio into shorter-term securities and was being " more selective on quality@ " in anticipation of perhaps having to repatriate some of its $160 billion or more of overseas assets. // He said then that Saudi Arabia had " not yet " made any liquidations . Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production has fallen to slightly more than 4 million barrels a day , from more than 10 million as recently as August 1981 . This suggests that some cashing-in of securities holdings , if not already begun , is imminent unless the kingdom decides instead to make use of its huge borrowing power. // But analysts say it is unlikely that Saudi Arabia , whose financial advisers have extensive experience , would take actions that would disrupt the capital markets. // Saudi officials are known to have engaged in a high-level debate about whether to tap their foreign assets , but their decision is not known . Some Western analysts think that the delays in paying contractors indicate that the go-ahead has not been given. // Today , Sheik Mana Saeed Otaiba , the oil minister ef the United Arab Emirates , said in a television interview on ABC News ' s " This Week With David Brinkley " that the OPEC members must soon agree on prices and production levels to avoid a price war that would be costly to all . He complained that " We in the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Despite the differing degrees of stress on various countries , one thing is clear : The worrisome 1970 ' s problem of " recycling " everincreasing OPEC surpluses has now disappeared . It has been replaced by lesser worries that some of the money is being withdrawn. //
