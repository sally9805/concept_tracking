How his inner council functions-and occasionally malfunctions <P> It is a Washington rite of passage : a member of the President 's inner council leaves under fire . His departure certifies that the new Administration is no longer new . Collisions with reality are forcing changes in personnel as well as modifications of policy . Post-Inaugural hopes and dreams are turning into a series of adaptations to unforeseen pressures and challenges . <P> That moment of truth has come at last for the Reagan Administration . Richard Allen last week abruptly took administrative leave from his post as National Security Adviser . The Justice Department absolved him of illegal behavior in his handling ( or mishandling ) of a $1,000 honorarium from a Japanese magazine that interviewed the First Lady last January . But there were other unanswered questions about Allen 's behavior in office , and the betting among Washington insiders was that he would not return to his post . In themselves , Allen 's alleged transgressions amounted to a very minor scandal indeed . His impressive title , and prominence on White House organization charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his temporary exit had nothing to do with the Administration 's long-run goals or even short-term tactics . Indeed , the conflicting and confusing statements put out by the White House damaged the Administration more than anything Allen himself did . <P> Nonetheless , Allen was one of the small group of advisers and assistants , unelected and sometimes all but unknown to the public , who serve every Administration as the President 's eyes , ears and hands . They bring information to the chief , define the policy choices that he confronts , ride herd on the bureaucracy to see how well his decisions are carried out . <P> Like the storm over Bert Lance 's financial dealings that broke in the first months of the Carter Administration , Allen 's problems raise a series of important questions . Just who are these President 's men ? How are they organized , how do they operate , how do their personalities play off against each other ? Above all , how well do they serve their President-and the nation ? <P> Those questions are especially critical in this Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aides to shape a policy consensus that he can accept , modify or reject . One answer is easy : there is no doubt which aides are most important . The so-called troika of Presidential Counsellor Edwin Meese , 50 , White House Chief of Staff James Baker , 51 , and Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver , 42 , almost constitutes an inner government . But how they are organized and operate is difficult even for the participants to describe . The troika is a puzzling three-headed creature that defies all the usual rules of orderly administration . <P> Conventional White House practice is to organize most aides into a tight system reporting through a single , powerful chief of staff . Richard Nixon worked that way . Jimmy Carter , in his first two years , tried a decentralized system , with several different aides reporting directly to him . This was not successful , and Carter reverted to the traditional system .
