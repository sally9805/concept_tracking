txt If the current disinflation continues . the economy is in for a couple of rugged years . A major reason is that business Investment . the key hope of the Reagan administration . is likely to be quiescent for a while . For an explanation of why , turn to " The General Theory of Employment . Interest and Money . " by John Maynard Keynes . Lord Keynes was a far better economist than many of those who became his " disciples . " The British economist saw the damage that disinflation does to the marginal effiSpeaking of Business by Lindley H. Clark Jr . ciency of capital . Before you flip over to another page . consider the simplicity of the idea . Suppose you have a machine capable of producing 10,000 widgets a week , and suppose you can sell all of the widgets in a rising market at prices that will give you a 25 ' , return on capital into the indefinite future . You 're sitting pretty . You not only will run your machine full blast but you 'll probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those moneymaking machines . But now suppose that the government decides that this inflationary nonsense has gone far enough . We 've got to stop it . And suppose further that , for once , this is not all talk and government policy does indeed start bringing down the inflation . You 're in a new ball game . The simplest aspect of the new game is that you have to pay off all of those 17 ? , ' * loans in dollars that are no longer depreciating so rapidly ; the debt has become much more of a burden . But even if you had fought off the urge to expand your widget business , you 've got problems . As Lord Keynes put it : The expectation of a rise ( or a slower fall ) in the value of money is depressing , because it lowers the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital . The widgets that you might have expected to sell two or three years from now at higher prices may actually bring in lower prices . So your return is lower , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no negative effect on investment if interest rates would fall just as East as the prospective return on capital . It should be stressed that what 's important here is prospective return . A businessman contemplating an expansion project now ca n't afford to gamble that things will somehow come out all right in 1984 and thus push ahead . If he 's doubtful about 1984 , he simply wo n't invest . " The stimulus to output , " Lord Keynes writes . " depends on the marginal efficiency of a given stock of capital rising relatively to the rate of interest . " That is n't the end of the matter , either . Businessmen generally believe that interest rates eventually will come down , and Reagan administration officials hope and pray they are right . But the immediate effect of that also discourages investment . Why ? Well , the prospect of lower interest rates lowers the prospective marginal efficiency of existing capital . Your dandy widget machines , during at least part of their lives , will have to compete with machines financed by lower-interest loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat lower rate of return . Lord Keynes was n't being an alarmist about that point . This " will have no great depressing effect , " he said , since the expectations as to future rates of interest will be reflected in part in current interest rates . Nevertheless , he continued , " there may be some depressing effect . " How do we get out of this depressing mess ? One way that eventually may appeal to a lot of policy makers is to reinflate the economy . A resumption of a fast price risewould also mean a rise in the marginal efficiency of capital . However , it also would be only too likely to mean a resumption in the rise of interest rates . Starting a new race between interest rates and return of capital seems a poor way to revive the economy . No. the best way to get this country growing again is to get interest rates down . They 'll come down when the markets are at last convinced that disinflation is for real . " Having repeatedly suffered sizable capital losses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit new funds to these markets unless they are compensated for the risk that the current commitment to overcome inflation might be abandoned , " the Council of Economic Advisers said in this year 's Economic Report . In many cases , the risk premium that investors insist on puts rates above the level that businessmen think would be . " Interest rates that are considerably higher than the current rate of inflation can have an adverse effect on investment and real economic growth . " the council said . " The level of long-term interest rates at the end of 1981 did not reflect investor willingness to believe that inflation will decline over the next several years . The presumably large but unmeasurable premiums being demanded by investors constitute a major obstacle to achieving rising output and employment with falling inflation . " None of this is new . Lord Keynes in the " General Theory " noted that " this is truth which lies behind Prof. Irving Fisher 's theory of what he originally called ' Appreciation and Interest . ' " Nor is there any new solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next couple of years will see a pretty weak economy . If it 's any consolation , things then should start to get a good deal better .
