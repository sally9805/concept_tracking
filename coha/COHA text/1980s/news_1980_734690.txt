txt The Environmental Protection Agency adopted costly new rules governing wells that inject chemicals or polluting wastes into the earth . The new rules , aimed at protecting underground dnnking-water sources , were proposed in 1976 and rewritten last year . The agency estimates they will cost business $230 million over the next five years . Most affected by the rules are the oil and gas and mining industries . Most states already regulate so-called " injection " wells , the EPA said , " but the quality of their programs is uneven . " Under the new rules , states must devise plans consistent with the EPA standards , or the federal government will take over enforcement of the program . Injection wells are used for many purposes . In the petroleum industry , for instance , they are used to pump chemicals into the ground in hopes of increasing an oil or gas well 's production . Such wells also are used to dispose of wastes from manufacturing or mining operations , and sometimes in sewage treatment . Coming Under Fire The EPA estimated that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creates what EPA administrator Douglas Costle termed " the widespread potential for contamination of precious underground water sources . " About half the nation drinks water from underground sources , Mr. Costle estimated . Recently , the EPA has come under fire from Rep. Albert Gore ( D. , Tenn. ) and from environmentalists for dragging its feet on issuing drinking-water rules . Agency officials attributed the long delay on the injectionwell rules to the difficulty of protecting health without diminishing production of vital energy supplies . The new rules require states to conduct an inventory of all injection wells within their borders once the EPA approves their programs . Within six months , the EPA said , the states must phase out wells that discharge " toxic , corrosive or other hazardous waste " into underground water supplies . Existing wells will have four years to apply for new state permits to continue operation , the agency said , but new wells ca n't be drilled without permits . For a few types of wells , such as those used for storm water runoff or for returning air conditioner water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it is still studying whether such wells should eventually require permits too . Correcting Faulty Wells Of the estimated $230 million price tag , the EPA said , about three-quarters of that sum will pay for correcting faulty wells and for building and operating new ones to comply with the standards . The rest of the money will go for tests , inspections and record-keeping required by the regulations . The EPA said the final rules are softened somewhat from its earlier proposals . The agency eased some of the proposed permit requirements to make the rules less costly , it said , and deferred regulations on disposal of highly radioactive wastes " pending an overall decision " by the Carter administration on the issue . The new regulations do n't cover gas and oil production wells , the EPA said , and at present also do n't cover wells used to store natural gas . However , the agency said it will continue studying gas-storage wells to see if further rules are needed .                @ @ @ @ @
