The surprisingly swift verdict came at 7 : 08 P.M. after just 12 hours of deliberation that followed a nine-week trial . Under Georgia law , Mr. Williams will be eligible for parole in seven years. // " I ' m sure there will be an appeal , " said Alvin Binder , the chief defense lawyer for Mr. Williams , a 23-year-old music promoter and talent scout. // As Lewis Slaton , the Fulton County District Attorney , read the jury ' s verdict , Mary Welcome , one of Mr. Williams ' s attorneys , sobbed quietly at the defense table. // The defendant and his father , Homer Williams , 68 , were permitted to make statements . " I maintained all along through the trial my innocence and I still say so today , " the defendant said . " I just hope the person or persons who committed these crimes can be brought to justice . I still say I didn ' t do this and that comes from the bottom of my heart . I more than anyone wanted to see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <> <> ' It Was the Fibers ' // His father said : " I feel that this is an error of justice . In fact , I don ' t see how anyone anywhere can find my son guilty . It is unjust , and I will say that anywhere in the world. " // " It was the fibers , , " Mr. Binder said of the prosecution ' s most telling evidence against Mr. Williams . " It certainly wasn ' t the witnesses. " // Mr. Williams was convicted of the murders of Nathaniel Cater , 27 , and Jimmy Ray Payne , 21 . Mr. Slaton is not expected to prosecute him in 10 other murders , evidence from which was allowed into testimony to try to show a pattern of behavior by Mr. Williams. // Faye Williams , the defendant ' s mother , was not present when the verdict was read , but in a television interview from her home an hour later , she said , " I feel like there ' s no justice in America. " // " The killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she added defiantly . " And it is not a black person . " Camille Bell , the mother of Yusef Bell , one of the slain youngsters , said a " kangaroo court " had put " Wayne Williams in jail and a killer on the streets . " The defendant , she said , was convicted on " lies and innuendos. " // Mr. Williams first came to the attention of law-enforcement officials shortly before 3 A.M. last May 22 . The authorities had begun surveillance of several bridges after the bodies of young blacks were found in the Chattahoochee and South rivers. // On May 22 , two Atlanta police recruits , a member of the police special weapons and tactics unit , and an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were stationed at the James Jackson Parkway Bridge over the Chattahoochee. // At 2 : 53 A.M. , the recruit below the bridge heard a loud splash and looked up at the bridge . He testified he had seen no headlghts and so looked back to the water , shining his flashlight on the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up again , he saw car headlights moving away . <> <> Headed Back Across Span // The special tactics officer was stationed near a liquor store at the end of the bridge . He testified that he saw the car enter the parking lot , turn around and head back across the bridge . The officer said he pulled out behind the car , which he identified as a white Chevrolet station wagon. // The officers and F.B.I. agent followed the car until it drove onto Interstate 285 , where they stopped it . Wayne B. Williams was the driver. // Two and a half days later , the body of Mr. Cater , a small , 27-yearold vagrant , surfaced a mile downstream . Mr. Cater was not the first adult to be placed on the list of missing and murdered young blacks . But he was the oldest and the last. // The first bodies were found on the same day , July 28 , 1979 , in woods in southwest Atlanta . Edward Hope Smith , 14 , was killed by a . 22-caliber bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Evans , 13 , was strangled. // Through 10 other disappearances and deaths of young blacks in the next year , no obvious links or particular pattern to the killings emerged , except that they were poor , most came from broken homes and the boys were generally street-wise , enterprising youngsters . <> <> Task Force Formed // For more than a year , investigators insisted there was no reason to believe the deaths were unusual . Nevertheless , because of public pressure and friction among various law enforcement agencies , a special task force was formed to investigate the killings . The Atlanta police were put in charge. // On Aug. 21 , 1980 , 12-year-old Clifford Jones , who was visiting from Ohio , was found strangled . The police said that is when they noticed a pattern begin to emerge . For the first time , fibers found on some of the bodies were linked. // The next year brought an increased frequency of missing and murdered youths .

Then came the splash at the river and Mr. Williams ' s questioning . But even then there was controversy . Mr. Williams was released after a couple of hours . His car was not impounded and he was not questioned by the F.B.I. // In addition , Public Safety Commissioner Lee Patrick Brown , the head of the task force , was not told about the incident on the bridge until the afternoon. // On June 3 , Mr. Williams was held at F.B.I. headquarters for 12 hours . He was arrested June 21 . A Fulton County grand jury indicted him for the murders of Mr. Cater and Mr. Payne , whose body had been found in the river about 500 feet from the spot where Mr. Cater ' s had surfaced. // Still , there were doubts . Twenty-eight persons had been killed , but the sole suspect was charged in only two cases .
