Though TIME tries to plan its cover art in advance , breaking news and shifting deadlines can mean that our cover artists have barely a day to do their work . Fortunately , they are assisted in that task by Deputy Art Director Rudy Hoglund , whose deft hand with a preliminary sketch can some times make all the difference . Late last week the magazine 's editors were meeting to change the cover story to this week 's report on growing opposition to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . Hoglund , who was sitting in for vacationing Art Director Walter Bernard , began sketching on his pad even as the editors talked . Within minutes , he had drawn a cover image to accompany the story . His inspiration was the Russian bear that had loomed pictorially over Iran , Pakistan and Afghanistan in a prescient cover he had designed last January for the " Crescent of Crisis . " Says Hoglund : " Back then we were careful to make the bear look interested but not too threatening , no bared teeth . This time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no doubt about it-his paw had claws . " Hoglund , an art director for More , the now defunct journalism review , has done plenty of fast cover drafting since he joined TIME in 1977 . " Disaster and late-breaking cover stories have a way of striking whenever Walter is away , " he says . " First , the New York City blackout in 1977 ; next , the election of Pope John Paul I ; then , the Jonestown massacre . Last March we joked that nuclear disaster would arrive during his next vacation , and , sure enough , that 's when Three Mile Island happened . " <P> In calmer times , when both are around , Bernard and Hoglund plan TIME 'S covers together , preparing separate sketches and then modifying each other 's concepts . " We design differently , " says Bernard . " Rudy never gives me a mirror image of what I am thinking . " Once a cover idea is approved by the editors , an artist is commissioned to turn out the finished product . <P> " Choosing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem is : Is he available , especially on an overnight assignment ? " Hoglund found that " Crescent of Crisis " Artist Doug Johnson was committed to another project last week . <P> But Johnson , who had been anticipating the return of his Soviet bear , found the prospect irresistible . " I postponed the other job , " says the artist , " by telling them that ' a matter of national security had come up . ' "
