WHITE WRITING : On the Culture of Letters in South Africa . By J.M. Coetzee . Yale University Press . 193 pp. $19.95 . THE ESSENTIAL GESTURE : Writing , Politics and Places . By Nadine Gordimer . Alfred A. Knopf. 356 pp. $19.95 . What can still be said about South Afnca ? The flock of editonalists , coffee-shop theorists and book reviewers who only two years ago were wondering whether the apartheid regime would outlast the decade have moved on to other subjects . How many ways can you restate that the blacks want nothing short of power and the whites wo n't give it up ? The subject is not just too intractable but also too loaded for genuine engagement . And if you happen to live there , you can say less and less because the state has tightened its grip on permissible speech . It has been illegal even to ask on a T-shirt for the release of detainees . The silence of an exhausted attention span here ; the silence of arrests , censors and bans there . Yet the books keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensifying agony of South Africa . The three under review here all ask , in different ways , the ques : tion posed above , especially as it applies to a highly uneasy group ? South African writers , specifically white writers . How can they survive ? They ca n't ? at least not in ways that one would recognize . That is the answer of these books , especially of Nadine Gordimer 's , and it seems the only honest one . The white liberal position in South Africa no longer exists . Anyone who clings to it is either advocating apartheid with a human face , knows the score but ca n't bring him- or herself to side with black revolutionaries , or has stopped living in the present . And the novel as it has been known in the West , a product of liberal capitalism , with its concern for the individual and his separate destiny , George Packer 's first book , The Village of Waiting , was recently published by Viking . has no more chance of surviving the whirlwind with its old form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament . Not just because the freedom to be irrelevant is now evaporating under the sun of a catastrophe but because whatever culture emerges from the ruins will have blacks at its center ; whites , who have never been able to imagine themselves anywhere else , will be on the periphery . To create anything meaningful , to create at all , they will have to submit their consciousness to that new centrifugal force . The liberal white novel will seem as quaint and anachronistic written after the apartheid era as the old Afrikaans farm novel seems now . ( What the new literature will look like , whether we will admire or even read it , is impossible to know Perhaps literature will be as alienated from the new order as it is from the old . Perhaps it will be as harassed , too . ) But there is a sense in which liberal whites have always been on the South African periphery , even while they 've held automatic membership in the white ego of apartheid South Africa . Christopher Hope , a writer of Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a minority ) , felt his existence in South Africa anchored by so little substance and buoyed by so much " incorrigible lightness " that in 1974 , at age 30 , caught between the nationalisms of Afrikaners and blacks , he floated off to exile in London White Boy Running is Hope 's account of his brief return on the eve of last year 's whites-only election . Foreknowledge of the result ? the rise of the right and fall of the liberals ? shadows Hope 's book . According to him , white liberalism has been steadily perishing , and aiding in its own destruction , since 1948 , " the killer year " when the great text of liberalism , Cry , the Beloved Country , was published and the National Party came to power on the apartheid platform . Hope was 4 and chasing ice cream carts in Johannesburg at the time . White Boy Running threads together two books : an autobiographical journey through the South Afnca in which the author grew up , and a parallel , essentially political commentary on what he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man goingfrom room to room in his childhood home ; the rooms are n't empty , but the relatives have all grown more deranged . Life for an English-speaking white boy in the years after 1948 brought the moral horror of Afrikaner orthodoxy . Even as a child Hope experienced the adult exile 's unbelief . When his family moved to Pretona , he says , " I began almost immediately to suffer from the first signs of a failure of faith ? not in my Catholicism , but in the existence of my country as a real place . " Or in his own and his tribe 's existence there  --  the tribe with neither true power nor a grievance , which hates the place as it is but ca n't bear to change it . Blacks are absent from White Boy Running , merely strangers banished from his youth . What obsessed him then , besides Elvis and rectors and sex , was Afrikaners . They were the Elephant Bird of a Pretoria dinosaur museum , " a very curious , hefty , thoroughly muscular creature , something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not as ridiculous as the Dodo , aka the white liberal ) . Yet the adult Hope never imagines that the Elephant Bird is really on the verge of extinction . After 1976 , after 1986 , it remains in its fortified nest . Anyway it 's flightless ? where would it go ? Hope found it still in place last year , busily engaged in a ritual that bore some resemblance to an election . Only now the National Party , which last time he checked was " dedicated to the antediluvian , conceived in reaction , " has become the party of reform ; which makes the Progressives ? what ? In the government 's view , the party of the African National Congress ( A.N.C. ) ; in Hope 's view , the party of " bankruptcy . " The only South Africans who seem able to see clearly and mean what they say are blacks and the white right . In a brilliant and scary set piece , the leader of the neo - Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement ( A.W.B. ) , Eugene Terre'Blanche , mesmenzes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his call for a Boer nation . " White voters will have to decide between the A.W.B. or the A.N.C. , " Hope interprets : " This crude and simple challenge seems to me to be nothing less than the truth . " Could white liberalism have made any difference in the past forty years ? Whatever the answer , Hope charges liberals with not just bad faith ? " However much we might disapprove of the government 's racial policies , we believe we sleep securely in the knowledge of the brutal efficiency of its police " ? but with complacency , arrogance and prolonged self-delusion . Liberals complain that democratic rights are shrinking ; they never recognized the hoax of the democracy itself . But false consciousness is not a problem just for members of the Progressive Federal Party . It is the occupational hazard of a writer in exile ; and it haunts the narrative of Hope 's return , in which the contemporary passages , always intelligent , are strangely disengaged and less affecting than the memoir . He 's gone back home in disguise , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member , mortified and helpless So his superb pieces of description or insight are often betrayed by a kind of sniggering coda that sounds like a native son 's cover for despair " It is the sort of conversation that makes me want to go and stick my head in a bucket of ice-cold water . " Irony is the voice of a South African who has a special grasp of the horror settling over " his " " country " but still has n't worked out his relation to it , who ca n't get rid of the quotation marks . These punctuate what Nadine Gordimer calls the dissident white writer 's " double alienation . " A book by a foreigner ( Joseph Lelyveld 's Move Your Shadow is an example ) can come closer to a tragic point of view because there is less at stake for the author . A portion of Hope 's irony is always reserved for himself . After all , having nothing else to offer , he too is a liberal Near the end of his stay in South Africa , Hope gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of brooding young men who exude a sense of skepticism , even hostility , which their courteous attention to my opening remarks can not disguise . " The evening begins inauspiciously . A poem in the point of view of a self-blinding white who ca n't comprehend black repudiation brings angry interruptions , and Hope never finishes it Then he tries reading from his recent novel The Hottentot Room . And a stunning thing happens The tension does n't vanish ; the interruptions do n't stop , in fact they increase by the page ; but " what is happening here is that my novel is being written by the audience , a task in which I am invited to join . A more conventional audience would not put these questions . A more pedantic author might reply loftily , ' What I have written , I have written ! ' But this is no place for pedantry . " And when the ordeal is over , he wonders : " What more could a writer ask ? " Hope wandered into a hornet 's nest , and he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This did n't mean that everyone was suddenly ready to be brothers under the skin . The poem , after all , could n't even be read . The net effect of the scene is no reassuring plug for free speech in wartime ; it is as chilling as it is moving . But it suggests at least the possibility that decency , beauty and intelligence will survive the South African nightmare It gives a glimpse of a South Africa Christopher Hope might find a way to live in White Writing : On the Culture of Letters in South Africa is a reminder that J.M. Coetzee is not only one of the world 's leading novelists but also professor of general literature at the University of Cape Town . Its prose , dry as the Western Cape , contains too many sentences like this : Is it a version of utopianism ( or pastoralism ) to look forward ( or backward ) to the day when the truth will be ( or was ) what is said , not what is not said , when we will hear ( or heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds9 Nor is its subject  --  literature up to World War II by white South Africans , much of it in Afrikaans and unavailable in translation ? going to appeal to more than a handful of readers . But Coetzee manages to be interesting , even when abstruse . " What relation , " he asks , " is it possible for man to have with rock and sun ? " South Africa 's natives , far from providing " materials to fill out its discourse , " have always been part of its emptiness , appallingly idle and hardly human to the early travel writers and later novelists . From the beginning , the white wnter has been perched over the threat of silence , " an inability to conceive a society in South Africa in which there is a place for the self . " In his own novels , Coetzee confronts this extinguishing of the self with a type of quietism . There can be no salvation inside history . The simple harelip hero of Life &; Times of Michael K finds , amid the devastation of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is enough to be out of the camps , out of all the camps at the same time . " But Nadine Gordimer , in a review not included in The Essential Gesture : Writing , Politics and Places , has asked in response : " Is there an idea of survival that can be realized entirely outside a political doctrine ? Is there a space that he s between camps ? " Gordimer 's implicit answer is no . And it seems to me that the whole direction of The Essential Gesture is toward finding a place for the white writer inside history that allows for a unity of life and art . Today , for her , that means finding a place inside the struggle for liberation . Tomorrow it will mean a place inside a black South Afnca . The first travel writers were stunned by what they saw as an empty land and empty people . At the end of three hundred years of trying to appropriate both , whites have again come face to face with their own inconsequence , the possibility of having no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other white writer , has escaped what Coetzee calls the " literature of failure , of the failure of the historical imagination . " Gordimer , more than any other , has made herself a part of the history of her time and place at every turn , always prepared to raise the deeper question and then answer it . This is not incidental to the brilliance of her prose style and imagination ; it fires both . It also demands more than mere brilliance from her writing , and in some cases it damages her writing . The unity of life and art is an unfinished struggle that vitalizes every page of The Essential Gesture . This is a record of one writer 's argument with herself and her society over three tumultuous decades . The rigor of her engagement is as exhausting as it is remarkable . The essays from the period before the black nationalist movements were banned and South Africa became a police state have a lighter tone ; but humor is no longer part of Gordimer 's arsenal , and the pieces from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraps from Benjamin and Luld.cs , more often sharply figurative : " In South Africa the ivory tower is bulldozed anew with every black man 's home destroyed to make way for a white man 's . " Gordimer was never a " moderate . " In 1959 , in a piece about decolonization called " Where Do Whites Fit In ? " she speculated that whites under black rule would have to see themselves as " foreign experts , employed at the Government 's pleasure , " or else leave . That was less hopeful ( and probably less acute ) than her reformulation of the question twenty-three years later , in " I wing in the Interregnum " : " Skills do not constitute a claim on the future hat claim rests on something else : how to offer one 's self " Between these two essays we can measure the change in Gordimer 's thinking and its intensity : from seeing the crisis as a political problem happening mainly to other people ? Albert Luthuli , Bram Fischer ? to experiencing it as existentially , morally , practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is not the objective observer . It reaches a peak of power and complexity in two of the last essays , " Living in the Interregnum " and " The Essential Gesture . " They stand as a challenge to herself and other whites , especially the white writer , " to find a way to reconcile the irreconcilable within himself , establish his relation to the culture of a new kind of posited community , non-racial but conceived with and led by blacks . " It is not enough to be " against " apartheid . If only this , one " remains negatively within the white order , " a charge that might be leveled at Christopher Hope . It is not enough ( she tells a New York audience ) to be against the abuses of Communism : " Have we to tell the poor and dispossessed of the world there is nothing else to be done than to turn back from the communist bosses to the capitalist bosses ? " Gordimer 's arguments take her further than most would go . " Art is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocatively . " In South Africa the essential gesture by which the writer enters the brotherhood of man . . . is a revolutionary gesture . " Is J.M. Coetzee on the side of the oppressed ? All of them ? Like God and Flaubert , he would probably swear off choosing sides at all . Would he be less an artist ? If truth is revolutionary , is it also then the revolutionary line ? Gordimer rejects orthodoxy where she sees it but she sometimes eases into it without seeing . Elsewhere she moves out of the declarative mood into the interrogative , as if the trail she 'd been following suddenly gave out onto the view of a drop into a sea where any artist would drown . She says she has only two absolutes : that racism is evil and that a writer is doomed if the link between inwardness and the world is severed . But she admits that in her country and her time , " The coexistence of these absolutes often seems irreconcilable within one life , for me . " The contradictions that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life , are the " morbid symptoms " of Gramsci 's " interreg num " between the dying old order and the emergent new . Last year Gordimer published A Sport of Nature , a true product of the interregnum . It is n't going too far ( only as far as The Essential Gesture ) to say that this novel exists to posit a literature and white identity in the black-led order to come . It is Azania 's first book . The opening third still takes place in the familiar Gordimer world of the old order , of conscience-stricken whites facing impossible dilemmas in the suburbs . But when her heroine , Hillela , leaves South Africa , tramps around the rest of the continent , marries a revolutionary , goes to work for the A . N.C. after he 's killed , then marries an African president and finally attends the ceremony of independence in what was once Cape Town , we have left the liberal novel behind and entered a strange hybrid of inspirational fable and panoramic political tract . Unsurpnsingly , the first hundred pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite patches of heart-stopping language , seems generalized and artificial , meanders and dissipates its strength . Hillela represents a new type of white African : takes the name Chiemeka , wears head scarves , chats as easily with market women in Lusaka as with party apparatchiks in Moscow and Brahmins in the Back Bay , longs for babies of all colors , bears one that is black ? possible , it seems , because Hillela herself is innocent of racial feeling . She is also rather mindless , highly sexed and has a streak of power-worship in her when it comes to black politicians . I doubt that Gordimer is saying this is how whites will have to be in the new order ; but it 's fair to ask what she is saying , for this novel has nothing in common with what the Gordimer of Burger 's Daughter and July 's People would see as the motive for writing . It is a deliberate flight from the intractable difficulties that those books hotly face and know ? all the while nagging the Western reader about the sacrifices these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also ignores the advice of " The Essential Gesture " : " I doubt whether the white writer . . has much social use in inspiriting . " A Sport of Nature is a daydream from an age of in-between . It demonstrates the inadequacy of the old white novel with its alien , victimized blacks , and the impossibility of any new kind while so much remains unreconciled and unreconcilable . Coetzee has pointed out that the South African novel does n't know how to end . One could add , because of the apparent endlessness of the " South African way of life . " But " it changes , " says the sticker Gordimer once saw on a taxi in Accra ; it is ending . And if literature in some form survives the horror that South Africa 's whites , barricaded in swimming pools , have determined to bring down on white and black alike , it will owe a great deal to Gordimer 's struggle to begin remaking it now . In the meantime , essays are perhaps the best tools available for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ones in The Essential Gesture will strike your ears with the clangor of difficult truth .
