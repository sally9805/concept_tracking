Using a technique popular in third world coups , Senator Bradley , a New Jersey Democrat , waited until his rival was out of the country before making his move . But senators and Congressional aides said Senator Boren , a Democrat from Oklahoma , got wind of it and set in motion a successful counterattack through a flurry of long-distance phone calls. // The incident illustrates several aspects of life in the Senate , where power politics is expected to be played with a certain amount of gentility . Several senators attributed Mr. Bradley ' s efforts to his Presidential ambitions , a desire perfectly acceptable in a chamber that has provided an ample supply of candidates in recent years . But the senators said the New Jersey Democrat had failed to understand the reluctance of Democratic leaders to tinker with a system that has protected their own interests as committee chairmen. // // Action in Closed Session // Senator Bradley declined to discuss the matter . A spokesman , Nick Donatello , said , " He doesn ' t comment on intelligence committee matters with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident , which has been a subject of gossip among some Democratic Party insiders since last year when , in a closed session of Senate Democratic leaders , Mr. Bradley ' s supporters raised the question of changing the chairman of the intelligence panel. // " I have a policy of never discussing internal steering committee matters , " Mr. Boren said . " I have a good personal relationship with Senator Bradley and all the members of the committee. " // Senator George J. Mitchell , the Maine Democrat who is Senate majority leader , confirmed that a dispute among Senate Democrats arose last year over how long any one senator can serve as intelligence committee chairman. // " Several senators asked me to limit the chairmanship to two years to permit more senators to serve in that capacity , " Senator Mitchell said in a statement . " Some others urged a four-year limit . I advised all of them that I want to review the matter carefully and in detail before making any decision , and that is what I intend to do . " <> <> Unwritten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairmanship of the intelligence committee would expand Senator Bradley ' s opportunities to appear on national television , exposure that could help him amass a large war chest for his 1990 re-election campaign for the Senate . The remainder of this money , in turn , could be used in a Presidential bid in 1992. // Several senators said the most striking aspect of the incident was that Senator Bradley appeared to violate the unwritten rules of conduct in what many members still consider a gentlemen ' s club . The Senate is a place where surprise attacks are considered bad form. // The confrontation between Mr. Bradley and Mr. Boren came as a surprise to many Senate Democrats . The two were thought to have a friendly relationship , and Senator Boren had already given his New Jersey colleague some chances for public exposure not usually available to less senior members. // Last year , the intelligence committee ' s report on the treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles was delivered by Mr. Boren , Senator William S. Cohen , the Maine Republican who is vice chairman of the panel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . <> <> Question of Seniority // Mr. Bradley and Mr. Boren are of the same generation . Both were Rhodes Scholars , Mr. Boren in 1963 and Mr. Bradley in 1965 . And both came to the Senate the same year , 1979 . When they were named to the intelligence committee in 1984 , the Democratic Party accorded Mr. Boren seniority because his previous service had included a term as Governor of Oklahoma. // That small difference proved important . After only two years on the intelligence panel , Mr. Boren became its chairman because the other senators ahead of him were already running major committees. // It was against this backdrop that the 25 members of the Democratic Steering Committee met last Nov. 29 to parcel out Senate committee chairmanships. // Most of them apparently expected the meeting to be routine , and that afternoon , Mr. Boren left for Africa on a long-scheduled trip . It quickly became clear , though , that something was afoot . <> <> Issue of Rotating Chairmanship // The first day of the steering committee ' s meeting ended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence panel , an omission that raised eyebrows among Mr. Boren ' s friends . The delay , it was revealed , was due to questions being raised by aides to Mr. Bradley over whether the chairman of the intelligence panel should rotate every two years. // This was more than a casual inquiry , because Mr. Bradley would otherwise have no chance of ascending to the chairmanship . Mr. Boren ' s term on the committee expires in 1992 and Mr. Bradley ' s expires in 1990. // Mr. Bradley had made an effort to lay some groundwork before he raised the question . Senate officials said that before the steering committee met , Mr. Bradley reminded Senator Dennis Deconcini that the Arizona Democrat could be intelligence chairman from 1990-92 if the Democrats backed the rotating chairmanship. // With the threat to his chairmanship clear , Mr. Boren began working the phones from Africa . He reached Senators David Pryor of Arkansas and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas , two Democrats who agreed to carry his argument at the meeting of the steering committee the next day. // Participants at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a two-year limit on serving as chairman of the intelligence committee . He was supported by Mr. Deconcini but opposed by Senators Bentsen and Pryor . <> <> Bradley ' s Arguments // Mr. Boren also got some help from an unexpected quarter . Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio , an intelligence committee member whose views are considerably more liberal than those of Mr. Boren , told the steering committee that he saw no reason for a change. // The argument made by the Bradley partisans was that the first chairman of the intelligence committee , Senator Daniel K. Inouye , Democrat of Hawaii , had stepped down after two years with the hope that the post would thereafter rotate every two years. // Mr. Bradley ' s supporters noted that since the committee was founded in 1976 , no Democrat has served more than two years as its chairman. // But they neglected to point out that Birch Bayh of Indiana , the only other Democrat to hold the post , left after two years because he was defeated for re-election. // Further , Barry Goldwater of Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate and vice chairman for four years when it did not. // When the dust settled , it was not necessary to take a vote or even make a motion . Senator Bradley ' s forces had failed . The consensus , senators later said , was that Mr. Boren had a reasonable expectation of serving six years in the job , and no one wanted to set a precedent of displacing a chairman before his time. // One senator who was present said , " You ' ve got to keep in mind , there were an awful lot of committee chairmen in that room. " //
