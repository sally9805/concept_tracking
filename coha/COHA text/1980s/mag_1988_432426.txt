 | Those who ca n't do , teach ? at least that 's what was always said about life in the ivory tower . But after a decade of seeing some of their sharpest professors ? and most lucrative research ? flee to the private sector , America 's universities are starting their own businesses . In the past year , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has taken stock in six campus-spawned ventures ranging from superconductivity to immunology . A new subsidiary of the University of Chicago is raising $10 million in outside investment to convert the fruits of its laboratories into marketable products . Even Harvard , which shunned earlier chances to team up with faculty entrepreneurs , is setting up a venture-capital fund to further mine its rich vein of medical research ; and the university was just awarded the first patent for a genetically altered animal . Such enterprise would have been unthinkable only a few years ago . Until 1980 , laws made it difficult for schools to take out patents on federally funded research , much of which is defense-related . Industry sponsors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus were left to pursue " pure " research ? while corporations reaped any rewards . Costly lesson . Academia has paid a high price for its virtue . Eight years ago in a highly publicized row , Harvard 's faculty torpedoed plans for the university to become part owner of a gene-splicing company formed by two of its scientists . That embryonic enterprise , Genetics Institute , is now worth $300 million . Spurred by the success of such ventures ? and spying potential gold mines in such new fields as superconductivity ? universities are seeking a piece of the action . The University of Utah , for instance , has shares in 26 campus spinoffs , including the company marketing the Jarvik-7 artificial heart . At Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , a for-profit development firm established in 1984 has launched five businesses . Among its most successful products : A blood recirculator used in 125 hospitals that reduces the risk of hepatitis B infection through transfusions. 1988 revenues could top $6 million . Pumping out profits is n't their purpose , administrators insist . " Our mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just to make money , " explains John Preston , MIT 's director of licensing . Schools are frustrated that many discoveries languish in the lab . They are under pressure from politicians who , interested in job creation and global competitiveness , now demand more practical results for their $7.8 billion in federal bucks . As costs for basic research and lab equipment soar , industry also has upped its stakes , tripling funding to more than $700 million a year since 1980 . Still , the urge to cash in on campus research remains a driving force behind the new hustle . Bolder schools are transforming backwater licensing offices into profit centers ; this year , MIT will issue 100 licenses , up from 12 a few years ago . And since owning shares in a start-up can net up to 10 times more than revenues from licensing , many schools also are taking stock in spinoffs along with their professor-inventors . MIT recently fetched $250,000 in cash for rights to its bioengineered techniques for combatting infectious diseases , as well as shares in Immulogic , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been exporting the technology to everyone , and they made all the money . " Some businessmen bristle at the hardball tactics . " It 's fine to promote your technologies and professors , but some schools are just going off the deep end on greed , " grumbles Kevin Kinsella , a partner with Avalon Ventures , a La Jolla , Calif. , early-stage investment firm . Qualms over coffeepots . Increasingly , schools are designing products on a flatfee basis . For $116,000 , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute created a coffeepot for North American Philips Corporation , with fewer parts and easier assembly . And Carnegie Mellon , renowned for robotics , configured a fully automated factory for Westinghouse Electric Corporation .  | In spite of the spurt of activity , only a handful of schools feel comfortable with what University of Utah President Chase Peterson calls " academic capitalism . " The reason : Faculty members still fear that business considerations , not scholarship , could drive decisions about what research to encourage ? and who deserves tenure . Several institutions hope to duck the problem by turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Dallas Biomedical Corporation , formed two years ago by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School , community leaders and local venture capitalists . The company picks up when federal research funding stops , kicking in money to determine if marketable products can be culled from lab work in progress . The university then has an option to buy a half interest in any spinoffs . Of eight projects bankrolled so far , two have grown into full-fledged firms ; one , GeneScreen , is developing tests for genetic susceptibility to cancer , diabetes and blood clots . Despite the growing prospects for profits , elite schools still balk at entrepreneurship ? and the commercial skew it might bring to labs . Notes Niels Reimers , Stanford 's director of technology licensing : " Some universities are going too far . " At Harvard , the issue has proved so thorny that a planned $20 million to $30 million investment fund will operate " at arm 's length " from the university to minimize potential conflicts of interest . Capital will be raised from a small group of professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school 's role remains so sensitive that one observer dubbed negotiations " the dance of the seven veils . " Crash course in marketing . A degree of caution may not be a bad thing , since schools have yet to prove their business acumen . MIT has been awarded nearly 800 patents since 1969 ? more than any other university ? yet nets just $3 million a year in royalties from industrial licenses . Johns Hopkins , which spends $700 million a year on research , earns a scant $100,000 . And Harvard says it will offer its cancer-prone mice for $1 each ? less than the cost to breed one . Moreover , only 1 in 10 of such ventures hits it big . Genetics Institute of Cambridge , Mass. , a firm developing hormones that boost the immune system , has spent over seven years and raised $200 million since breaking with Harvard ? and has yet to bring one product to market . The company stands to turn a handsome profit when its wares finally hit the shelves . But that wo n't be until 1990 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem determined to learn by doing . Not that academics prove as adept at business as lab research . For example , cost overruns at Biogen , Harvard 's other notable biotechnology spinoff , forced the firm to trim operations , and led founder and Nobel Prize-winning biologist Walter Gilbert to resign . Such setbacks do n't seem to rattle the ivory tower , however ; as the old saw notes , those who ca n't compete end up back in the classroom .
