NEW YORK  --  T. Boone Pickens Jr. and Asher B. Edelman play pretty much the same brand of investment hardball . But in different leagues . As many people know by now , Mr. Pickens , the controversial Mesa Petroleum Co. chairman , spent much of the past few years crisscrossing America in an $11 million corporate jet plotting the fate of companies like Cities Service Co . , Gulf Corp. and Phillips Petroleum Co . Meanwhile , Mr. Edelman , a 45-year-old New York arbitrager and aggressive investor , was crisscrossing Manhattan in a chauffeur-driven Jeep , plotting the downfall of such lesser corporate lights as Canal-Randolph Corp . , Management Assistance Inc. and Mohawk Data Sciences Corp . But , hey , a fellow ' s got to start somewhere . Before late 1982 , Mr. Edelman spent months each year at his Sun Valley ski retreat or hiking in the mountains . But he has been making up for lost time . Since then , he has forced his way into top management positions at Canal-Randolph , Management Assistance and Mohawk Data Sciences , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Datapoint Corp. , a computer concern in which he already holds a nearly 11% stake . Mr. Edelman prefers to work in the shadows , away from the glare of publicity . Thus , he won ' t disclose the size of his fortune  --  associates say it ' s probably a bit more than the $50 million Mr. Pickens is estimated to hold  --  or what part of it is represented by the Edelman art collection , which contains original works by Ad Reinhardt , Pablo Picasso and Jasper Johns . Nor will Mr. Edelman identify his limited partners . And asked how many children he has , he replies " somewhere between two and five " before confessing " three . " Mr. Edelman says , " I hate the fight . I hate the fight " involved in badgering a target company . Well , maybe , but he ' s hardly been bashful about aggressive tactics in the past . In 1977 , he even sued his brother Jon following the breakup of an arbitrage concern they founded a few years earlier . Arbitrage is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security in different markets . The Canal-Randolph battle represented Mr. Edelman ' s first foray into the " 13D " business , so named after the form that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission after acquiring 5% or more of a public company ' s stock . He eventually acquired about 30% of Canal-Randolph ' s stock , won a proxy fight and subsequently was named vice chairman of the real estate and stockyards concern . At his urging , the company is in the process of liquidating , having spun off its stockyard operation to shareholders . In going after increasingly larger companies , Mr. Edelman followed similar scripts at both Management Assistance and Mohawk Data , both of which had fiscal 1984 sales in excess of $400 million . He convinced management that the companies had a higher value if they were broken up and some pieces were sold and others run separately . Canal-Randolph had annual revenue of less than $50 million the year Mr. Edelman was chasing it , while Datapoint had fiscal 1984 sales of slightly more than $600 million . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain control . A little before the Mohawk Data annual meeting , Mr. Edelman made a tough-sounding offer : Make me chairman , or I ' ll buy the company . Mohawk Data made him vice chairman and chairman of the finance committee  --  posts that , he says , let him be in charge of selling the pieces of the company . That ' s what he says he was after . Not surprisingly , Plaza Securities Co . , Mr. Edelman ' s closely held investment concern , is growing fast . It had a 42% increase in partnership capital during 1984 , to about $43 million at year-end from $30. 3 million at the end of 1983 . Plaza had 1984 net income of about $11 million , a 15% increase from $9. 6 million in 1983 . Formed in 1979 , Plaza has about 72 limited partners , including Mr. Edelman ' s wife and children . Mr. Edelman has a concise , studious mind and uses it doing his own analysis for the companies he is chasing . He says he has never put all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . " I prefer to play it cautiously . " He says that in his 13D business he is attracted to asset-rich companies or ones with divisions that could be operated separately . " Mainly , I pick a company where I see ( that ) a reasonable restructuring , rather than a recreating , of the operating base can add value " to the company .
