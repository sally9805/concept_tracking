Banks in the U.S. charged customers $145 million in fees last year for writing checks that bounced because of " uncollected funds . " That is banking jargon for deposits that have not yet been credited to a customer 's account during a holding period , as long as three weeks for out-of-town drafts , that the institutions have traditionally imposed as both a precaution against bad checks and a way to profit from the float . But the consumer frustration of waiting for a check to clear will be vastly reduced by new U.S. regulations that took effect last week . The law requires that checks drawn on local institutions must clear within three business days and that out-of-town checks may take no more than seven days . By September 1990 , the holding period will shrink to two business days for local checks and five days for out-of- town checks . <P> Not everyone is delighted by the reform . For grocers , who cash 3.5 billion checks a year , it will require some irksome adjustments .

For example , endorsements must be confined to the top 1 1/2-in. portion on the back of the check . Many supermarket managers will have to buy new equipment to stamp precise endorsements on the checks and train their staff how to use the new system .
