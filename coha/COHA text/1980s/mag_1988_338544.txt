Tebuthiuron , better known by the trade name Spike , is a herbicide used to get rid of mesquite from rangeland and brush from along utility power lines in the arid American Southwest . Made only by Eli Lilly , the giant Indianapolis chemical company , Spike attacks woody plants for up to three years . After searching for several years , the U.S. Department of Agriculture discovered that Spike not only kills weeds but may be the first effective herbicide against the hardy coca plant , the source of cocaine . <P> As part of its war on drugs , the U.S. reached an agreement with Peru to test Spike 's effectiveness on its cocaine crop . The State Department wants to supply Peru with the herbicide for an eradication project in the Upper Huallaga Valley , along the eastern Andes , where much of the world 's coca is grown . Peru would get the assistance ; Lilly would get the order ; and the coca would get annihilated . <P> Last month , however , Lilly suddenly announced that it would not sell Spike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been fully tested in Peru . The company was undoubtedly reacting to protests by environmentalists , who claim that use of the herbicide on the Andes ' delicate ecosystem could turn it into a desert . Just after Lilly 's announcement , Walter Gentner , a recently retired research scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture , complained that he had been pressured by the State Department to condone use of Spike in Peru before its impact had been assessed . <P> The question of whether to Spike or not to Spike puts Government antidrug crusaders , environmentalists and corporate America in an awkward three-way tug-of-war . Last week Sandra Marquardt of the environmental group Greenpeace accused the State Department of a " scorched-earth tactic that threatens to wipe out most plant life in the region for five years or more . " Scientists for the Environmental Protection Agency say Tebuthiuron can harm useful vegetation if it leaches into groundwater . Ecologists contend that it would be difficult for farmers to grow crops after the coca has been destroyed . They point out that Spike is not meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern Andes . Warns Edgardo Machado , a Peruvian coca researcher : " The rain will drag the herbicide into the soil at lower levels of the valley , where there are farms . " <P> The State Department has accused Lilly of going AWOL in the war against narcotics . U.S. officials say the crucial test for Spike will be conducted in the Andes over the next 90 days and insist that no decision should be made until then . In a press conference last week , Ann Wrobleski , Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotics , asserted that the Upper Huallaga Valley " is not suitable for crops . Peasants moved into the valley to grow coca , period . " She pointed out that the cocaine traffickers , who use the area to process the raw leaf into cocaine paste , have inflicted the most environmental damage . She cited a Peruvian study estimating that in 1986 , traffickers dumped some 100 million liters of harmful chemicals into the area 's rivers . <P> The State Department is trying to persuade Lilly to reverse its decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the coca plants by hand . Though ecologically safe , that method has drawbacks : the program last year managed to clear only 876 of the 395,000 acres under coca cultivation .
