One night in November 1963 , four mop-topped lads from Liverpool strode triumphantly onto the stage of London 's Prince of Wales Theater before an audience of upper-crust fans that included the Queen Mother herself . As TIME quoted the group 's lanky , irreverent leader : " Those of you in the cheaper seats , clap . The rest of you , rattle your jewelry . " With that remark , John Lennon made his first appearance in the pages of TIME . As the years went by , Lennon and his fellow Beatles have turned up countless times in the magazine-and in the lives of a fortunate handful of its writers and correspondents . <P> When the Beatles made their first visit to the U.S. in 1964 , Senior Editor Christopher Porterfield , then a trainee in TIME 'S Washington bureau , was assigned to follow them . Porterfield recalls : " All of them were joking and clowning a lot , but John 's humor glinted with a fine , hard intelligence and had a mocking , satirical edge . He also had a sharper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1968 , when he and Paul McCartney were in New York to announce the formation of their own record label , Apple Corps. , Ltd .

Duffy was in Toronto interviewing Novelist Jacqueline Susann , who was there to promote her book The Love Machine .

Recalls Duffy : " I was surprised that they were so friendly and welcoming . John was very gentle but not in a soft way . He had a strong sense of himself . " <P> Jay Cocks , who wrote the main story , first met Lennon in 1976 through mutual friends . Over the years Cocks found him to be " extraordinarily smart , witty , angry and basically unknowable . " <P> Sums up Porterfield : " Of all the Beatles , Lennon was the one who showed the greatest depth and complexity . His was the growth I expected the most from , and now that growth has been cut short . "
