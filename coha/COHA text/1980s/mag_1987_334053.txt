The idea was something along the lines of one for all and all for one . Top- notch U.S. high-tech companies would combine their research efforts and defeat their fierce competitors from Japan . But now the alliance , known as the $ Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corp . ( MCC ) , is suffering some serious defections . Last week MCC announced that Unisys , Lockheed and Allied- Signal had given notice that they will be departing from the consortium at the end of the year . All three companies say in essence that being part of the group no longer fits their needs . <P> Moreover , the consortium must find a successor to Bobby Inman , the former CIA deputy director , who left his post as chairman of MCC at the end of 1986 . Inman , who says he now wants to concentrate on bringing advanced technology to the marketplace , will head Westmark Systems , a new holding company that will acquire high-tech defense-industry firms . <P> MCC was formed in 1982 by ten companies , in part to counter Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop new supercomputers . The consortium 's member firms agreed to pool the results of jointly financed long-term research conducted at an Austin center on such subjects as artificial intelligence and the making of silicon microchips . The original MCC roster was an honor roll of technological titans , including Digital Equipment , Advanced Micro Devices , Honeywell and National Semiconductor . Subsequently other respected firms , including 3M and Boeing , joined , and the current membership numbers 20 . <P> But despite the substantial progress reportedly being made in MCC labs , the consortium 's work has been hampered by the wary independence of some of its members . While MCC companies all want to share in the fruits of the consortium 's research , they do not want to give competitors an edge . Says Drew Peck , who follows electronics companies for the Gartner Group : " Member firms are reluctant to assign their first-tier researchers to MCC . To them , sharing their research talent and resources with competitors is considered an unnatural act . " But that is exactly what U.S. companies may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
