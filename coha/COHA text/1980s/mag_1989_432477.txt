 | A violent crime is committed every 5 seconds , leaving an anguished victim and a scarred community . Sometimes the wounds reopen with a vengeance , especially when the public believes a heinous act has been grievously mishandled . Much of California rose in revolt in 1987 when a convict named Larry Singleton was released on parole eight years into a 14-year sentence for raping 15-year-old Mary Bell Vincent , chopping off her arms with an ax and leaving her to die in a ditch . Singleton was forced out of six California communities by outraged citizens . A similar outcry greeted revelations that John Mack , top aide to then-House Speaker Jim Wright , attempted to murder a woman named Pamela Small 16 years ago and served only two years in jail because Wright helped him get a job . Mack resigned amid a storm of criticism once Small spoke publicly about her ordeal . For every such notorious case there are many millions of less noticed , but no less traumatizing crimes . And for most of the victims , suffering comes not only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal justice system leaves no place for victims or their survivors . Last week , in Worcester , Mass. , the beleaguered justice system delivered the second knockout blow to May Foy , the widow of a cabdriver slain last year . Two men agreed to admit killing Thomas Foy in return for parole eligibility within 15 years . But the widow pleaded that the deal was unfair and called for a jury trial to ensure " justice done in the American way . " Unexpectedly last month , a judge accepted her argument , rejected the plea bargain and ordered a trial . But last week , prosecutors went before another judge and had the first ruling overturned , sealing the plea bargain and outraging the family . There is another victim when a violent crime occurs . It is the community . After any serious crime , neighborhoods change as fear grows and morale drops . If enough crimes are committed , signs of massive decay set in , most alarmingly in the growing number of instances when police are unable to address the kind of routine street crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore burglaries , purse snatchings and radio pilfering from cars just to keep pace with the attacks that draw blood . Abused by the system Most harrowing of all is the way the bloodletting has become pervasive and unpredictable . Victimization is a chronic state . The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 83 percent of children now 12 years old will become victims of actual or attempted violence if crime continues at current rates . The innocent ( called " mushrooms " by gangs ) increasingly are being hurt . The number of bystanders gunned down in New York City , Boston , Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , tripled in three years . Last week , 33-year-old Rhonda Anthony was killed  | in a crossfire while sitting on her front porch in a residential Washington , D.C. , neighborhood overrun with drug dealers . After they are assaulted , victims must continue their struggle in a legal environment that pays more attention to their adversaries than to them . The system 's lack of concern for victims derives from traditions of English law that insist justice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the state rather than the defendant and the victim . In the United States , that means the rights enshrined in the law are those accorded criminal suspects . The Supreme Court in the past three decades has vastly extended defendants ' rights by limiting police powers to question suspects without defense attorneys present and to seize evidence without warrants . Even the more conservative Rehnquist Court has bitterly disappointed victims when they argued their interests were on the line . Two years ago , Justices rejected the use in death-penalty cases of " victimimpact statements " that tell juries about the victim 's background and how a murder affected the family . Last month , the Court voted 5 to 4 to void a death sentence against a South Carolina killer . The Justices ruled a victim 's personal attributes such as importance to a family and a community are not pertinent to the " moral culpability " of the defendant . Slow and uncertain punishment More infuriating for victims are the faults in the system itself . Punishment of society 's wrongdoers is neither sure nor swift . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 5 major crimes . When a cop does manage to collar a suspect , it may take more than a year in crowded urban court systems to dispose of the case . A new study reports the average disposition time in crime-ridden Newark , N.J. , as 308 days . In the meantime , about 1 in 6 defendants who are free on bail is arrested for new crimes . Resources are so scarce throughout the system that up to 9 cases in 10 , depending on the city , end in plea bargains that reduce the charges against criminals . Such procedures are necessary because courts and prosecutors are far too strapped for funds to provide a jury trial for every defendant . But that is no comfort to those who have been violated . A spate of tough sentencing laws has extended terms for many crimes , and prison rolls have more than doubled since 1980 to 630,000 . Yet penal institutions are so overcrowded that only 1 case in 6 leads to a prison term , and space limits dictate that the average time in custody remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for newcomers . Most " life " terms end before 10 years are spent behind bars . In Los Angeles County , where the jail population of 22,000 could fill a city , inmates serve one day for every 30 days stated in the sentence . Many victims blame the gravest violations on juvenile courts . Created decades ago to provide special treatment for youths under 17 , who presumably were  | not hardened criminals , the system has been intensely criticized for not responding to the increasingly vicious behavior of young criminals . A recent Justice Department report estimated that nearly half of juveniles picked up for violent offenses are put on probation or released outright . Even if a young criminal is imprisoned , the term generally can not extend beyond age 17 . Drug peddlers often use young teens to do their dirty work because they know they will not do serious jail time . The result of these systemic failures is a sense of bitterness and frustration that can be felt across the nation : Jacob McGrogan , 48 , a Pittsburgh bartender , was walking home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered him a ride . They promptly robbed him of $70 , in the process beating him brutally with a baseball bat , blinding him permanently and wrecking his hearing . McGrogan was furious to learn that , at the time of the attack , one of the accused , Brian Wolfe , was at large after being released pending trial for an earlier assault . " If the system had worked right , he would n't have been out on the street and I would n't be blind , " says McGrogan , who soon will enter a home for the disabled . In Queens , N.Y. , John and Maureen Woods faced an ordeal after a teenager fatally stabbed their 16-year-old son David in the heart as the honor student tried to settle a quarrel . The couple complains that , without telling them , a prosecutor allowed the jury to choose between murder and manslaughter charges . The sentence could have run to 25 years , but the judge imposed a 4-to12-year term that could lead to the killer 's parole in four years . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says John Woods . His wife adds : " We have been victimized twice ? by the killer and the system . " Tamra Wimler 's suffering began when Jerry Gallo , a former boyfriend , kidnapped her and forced her into an abandoned warehouse , where he raped her repeatedly and threatened to kill her . Wimler soon became prime witness in the case of People v. Gallo . First , the 27-year-old bank aide says , she was followed by " goons " everywhere she went . Then the defense accused her of stealing from Gallo 's bank account . One day , she was " scared to death " when she learned that he might win release on bail and come after her . A judge delayed the case again and again when the defense pleaded for more time . " You ca n't recuperate , " she says of the woes that did not end even after Gallo received a 35-year prison term , which he is appealing . " It 's not like what happens on TV . " Not surprisingly , as such frustrations mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fully 7,000 groups have sprung up to ease the inner pain and some of the financial difficulties of victims . And an increasingly potent movement has arisen to address what many see as imbalances in the way the law treats victims . In the past decade , reports the Washington-based National Organization for Victim Assistance , states have passed 1,500 laws aimed at giving victims broad new rights to participate in the cases against their assailants . Many states have toughened penalties for those who threaten victims , and have barred criminals from profiting when their stories are told in books and movies . Many changes were designed to help victims cope with the aftermath of attacks on them by providing counseling and some measure of financial relief for the losses they suffered . Second-generation reforms For all its success , the victims ' - rights movement continues to face the indifference of many authorities to its demands . " Many officials believe that it is just too  | time-consuming and cumbersome to involve victims in such decisions as pretrial release and sentencing , " says Jane Burnley , chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most victims are unaware of their rights to participate . In 1982 , Californians voted a constitutional amendment giving victims the right to address judges at their assailants ' sentencing . Mostly because of ignorance , 97 percent failed to appear . Those who did speak in court had little effect on the sentencing outcome . Undaunted , victim supporters are seeking a second generation of protections . They succeeded last year in Florida and Michigan , which enacted constitutional amendments that guarantee victims the right to take part in each stage of the justice process , from being notified of arraignments to being able to speak at parole hearings . " Our primary goal is not harsh punishments or money but to be involved , " says Roberta Roper , who led a campaign to change Maryland laws after her daughter was murdered in 1982 . At another level , many victims would like a chance to confront their assailants . Some states are experimenting with mediation sessions where victims and offenders talk out their differences , prodding assailants to acknowledge the damage they have wrought and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays Some promising reforms involve new sentencing schemes . " We need to create interim punishments that make convicts accountable without overstraining the corrections system , " says James Stewart , chief of the Justice Department 's research arm . One answer is restitution . More judges are ordering defendants to repay victims for losses , although the procedure still is underutilized . California plans to open " restitution centers , " where selected inmates would live and hold down jobs in the community , paying one third of earnings to their victims and splitting the rest with the state . Victim advocates lobbied for the program , but it has been delayed by objections to convicts ' living in residential neighborhoods . States and localities also have fallen short with their own programs to provide for the financial losses suffered by crime victims . Their reimbursements do not come close to covering the more than $15 billion lost to crime annually . Payments to victims average less than $1,900 . And limitations in some states make it impossible for any but the poor to qualify . Victim advocates are laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police chiefs and Republican leaders are pushing for voter approval of a plan that would speed preliminary hearings , streamline jury selection and curb stalling tactics of defense lawyers . Reformers are less sanguine about retooling the juvenile system . Victims back transferring particularly violent cases to adult court , but the evidence is mixed on whether the tactic results in harsher penalties for chronic offenders . If history is any guide , the needs of victims will be addressed only by fits and starts . Many hope the Supreme Court will get another conservative member and change in favor of victims . And taxpayers furious about rampaging drug use may even be willing to pay for the kind of prosecutorial and prison resources to keep the worst offenders behind bars longer and perhaps even provide more compensation for victims . But even if the scales begin to tip more toward them , victims will never get enough from the government to assuage the awful , unique violation each has endured . Some wounds never heal .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
