Scores of shootings in the last two months have left eight people dead and dozens injured . The police have responded by stopping and searching more and more people in two predominantly black areas , a tactic that has provoked almost as much concern as the shootings themselves. // To be sure , the number of shootings in Boston is small , especially when compared with the rate of violent crime in other cities its size . In its latest report on crime statistics in the nation ' s 34 largest cities , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ranked Boston 18th , with 93 murders in 1988 . Washington , roughly the same size , ranked first , with 369 murders . The rankings were based on the number of people killed per 100 , 000 in population. // // Degree of Reaction // What has been most remarkable in Boston is the reaction . This is a city where people like to stroll along the waterfront after dark , and government buildings have no metal detectors at their doors . But now " people are very alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a number of innocent people getting hit , in the white community , in the black community , all across the city. " // City officials are at a loss to explain the burst of violence . Some attribute it to struggles between teen-age gangs , others to a combination of cocaine and crack trafficking and a ready supply of guns. // " I don ' t know if I even have the answer , " said the Police Commissioner , Francis M. Roache . " Suddenly we ' ve had a lot of violence . But I am convinced that drugs are at the heart of all of our problems in this country . People want to protect their turf and their business. " // Robert V. Ward , a former Suffolk County prosecutor who teaches criminal law at the New England School of Law , agreed : " We do have the gangs , and there is a proliferation of firearms , which I suspect is related to the drug problem. " // More than 170 shootings have been reported here since Sept. 1 . Some victims were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in street battles or sprayed from passing cars . Lloyd Fraser Jr. , 19 years old , was shot in the stomach and the arm while sitting in a friend ' s car on Oct. 16 . Two days earlier Michael Veney , 16 , was shot in the neck as he stood on a street corner in the Dorchester section. // And in the most heavily publicized incident , Carol Stuart , a 30-year-old tax lawyer from suburban Reading , was abducted and shot Monday night along with her husband as they left childbirth classes at Brigham and Women ' s Hospital . Her husband , Charles Stuart , 29 , remains in critical condition , and the couple ' s son , Christopher , who was delivered two months prematurely just before his mother died , is also in critical condition . <> <> Gun Seizures Are Up // State Representative Byron Rushing said the violence has existed all along but is only now getting attention . " It takes time for people to get fed up with something , " he said . " People doing the shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have are more sophisticated . Those changes have made people realize that they have been tolerating too much of it. " // Terence J. McArdle , special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in Boston , said gun seizures in the city are up , suggesting that guns are now more available than in the past . " All of a sudden we ' re seeing , for the first time , more firearms seized that have been purchased out of state , " he said. // Police statistics show that 316 guns have been seized in arrests this year , as against 204 last year and 127 in 1987 . Most are better made and more costly than those seized in the past , Mr. McArdle said . " There ' s no Saturday night special any more , " he said. // Mayor Flynn said the sources of the violence are too much for the city ' s 2 , 300 police officers to handle alone . " When we ' re talking about the flow of drugs and guns into our city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " You have to deal with the underlying problems of poverty and despair . " To do that , he said , requires vast amounts of money that the Federal Government no longer provides and the state , facing budget shortfalls of its own , is unable to supply . <> <> Constitutionality Questioned // What the city has done is endorse intensified police patrols , including the the searches . The police say that in patting down suspected gang members and their associates to find weapons , they are following a policy that has been on the books for two decades. // But a judge in Suffolk County Superior Court , Cortland A. Mathers , ruled last month that the searches amounted to official misconduct , and he dismissed charges against two young black men . At the hearing , five black teen-agers called by the defense testified that they were routinely stopped and searched by the police and forced to spread-eagle against walls and remove their pants. // The judge asked the State Attorney General , James Shannon , to review the search policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police were violating constitutional rights. // The policy states that police officers must have " reasonable suspicion " before stopping someone , and " objective facts " leading them to believe someone may be armed before they conduct a search. // But State Senator William Owens , who represents two neighborhoods singled out for the searches , Roxbury and Dorchester , asserted that people are being searched simply because they are young black men . <> <> Violence and Civil Liberties // " There are two issues here , " Senator Owens said . " One is the danger and the gang violence in the community that clearly has to be eradicated . The other is the violation of the law by the police . You can ' t make the first one right by doing the other wrong . " He has asked the Legislature to create a committee to investigate the policy. // But Councilman Bruce C. Bolling , who supports the policy , countered , " In some respects , there has been a preoccupation with this policy that has somewhat got us sidetracked from the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson , director of a crime prevention program in Roxbury , agreed , saying police commanders met with area residents and told them " aggressive policing " would include searches. // " Right now , the police have to do what they have to do , " Ms. Watson said . " Unfortunately , there are good kids who are stopped and searched . But I ' ve heard people say : ' In these times , I don ' t mind . My child being searched and having nothing is better than me seeing him in a coffin. ' // " Instead of us yelling about the constitutional rights of the kids , " she added , " we have to explain to them that times are hard right now . And we have to think about the constitution of safety . If you handcuff the police , who do you have ? " // The Mayor said he disagreed with Judge Mathers ' s decision , saying that while he did not want " to compromise anyone ' s constitutional rights , " the policy has to be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " //
