 | The wonderful thing about America is that it continues to produce cultural double crosses that upset the status quo . It 's sheer delight that Richard Pryor should have become a culture hero and a box-office super-superstar in the age of Ronald Reagan , the New Right and the Moral Majority . Funky , untamable , outrageous , Richard Pryor is the funniest comedian of our time , the man who took the jackhammer profanity of the black underclass and turned it into a scathing , hilarious street poetry . The unruly Richard Pryor who miraculously escaped death when he set himself on fire two years ago while " free-basing " cocaine has become a performer so hot that Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds look like snowmen . In an unprecedented one-two punch , Pryor stars in two runaway moneymakers , " Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip " and " Some Kind of Hero , " movies which in a few weeks have grossed roughly $48 million . He is now filming " The Toy " with Jackie Gleason in Baton Rouge , La . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time . The ever-expanding audience for his live performances now ranges across blacks and whites of all classes . He and Gene Wilder have become the first successful interracial comedy team ; their two movies , " Silver Streak " in 1976 and " Stir Crazy " in 1980 , have together grossed in the neighborhood of $200 million . Pryor 's recordings have been comparably successful in their own terms : he has won Grammys for " Bicentennial Nigger , " " Is It Something I Said ? " and " That Nigger 's Crazy , " which became a " platinum " seller ( 1 million copies ) . All this is no news to Thom Mount , executive vice president in charge of production at Universal Pictures , who in 1975 signed Pryor to a deal to write , perform and ultimately produce his own material . " Pryor is the most significant crossover artist in the history of the movies , " says Mount . " And there 's one simple reason for his success : Richard tells the truth about the human condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what makes him so wonderful . " As a performer Pryor is most wonderful when he 's doing his own material in concert performances . As in most of his twenty-odd movies , Pryor rises above his material in " Some Kind of Hero , " in which he plays a returning Vietnam prisoner of war who loses his hero status , his wife , his money and almost his life back in the United States . The thin script does n't do justice to this theme 's possibilities , but Pryor as usual has perfect pitch in his acting . The film is studded with Pryoresque gems : Pryor , his life coming apart , responding with hysterical laughter to the questions of an Army psychiatrist ; Pryor , in a Vietnamese prison camp , establishing a warm friendship with an amiable rodent with whom he shares his meager rations . But " Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip " is something else again . Three years ago Pryor starred in " Richard Pryor Live in Concert , " a film of a live performance that represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funniest movies ever made . In this masterwork Pryor rides a whirlwind of as- tounding effects , comic energy and inspiration : his Macho Man routine is the ultimate skewering of male sexual arrogance ; he demonstrates his amazing ability to become animals , from monkeys to malamutes ; and he plays a heart attack ? not just the victim ( which he was ) but the heart attack itself , turning pain and terror into something crushingly funny and compassionate . " Sunset Strip " does n't match the devastating perfection of " Live in Concert , " but as a historical document of a superb artist in transition it 's unforgettable . In his first live performance since his fiery accident , Pryor prowls the stage like a red-@#  | suited Lazarus who has come through the Inferno . The air of uncertainty that hangs over his performance is not so much an esthetic defect as it is a dramatic tension : we 're watching not a smooth performance by a master , but a man putting himself back together after a brush with physical and spiritual extinction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes of race , sex and pieces of his own life . He plays out his unsuccessful interracial marriage ( " The first two years we went together she thought her name was White Honky Bitch " ) . He enacts a trip to Africa in which his anthropomorphic genius is at its best : he becomes a lion in a zoo , pacing his cage with an apologetic shrug like a leonine derelict on some jungle skid row ; then he 's the bush lion , preening himself like some narcissistic stud on a muscle beach . The climax of the film is Pryor 's enactment of his incendiary ordeal , a psychodrama at once mirthful and merciless in which he plays everything from himself to his friend Jim Brown to the freebase pipe that speaks to Pryor with satanic seductiveness about the ecstasies of getting stoned . " Live on the Sunset Strip " almost died . It was edited by director Joe Layton from two evening performances at the Hollywood Palladium . The first was a disaster . Pryor , who writes all his own material , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes working with his friend Robin Williams . He had setup the " Pryor on fire " routine as the finale , but on opening night he was seized by " comic panic " and opened with it . " It went great , " he says , " but then the show was over . There was nowhere to go . And the demons said : We knew you were gon na f -- - up . We were waitin ' for ya . Now whatcha gon na do ? ' " What he did was walk off the stage , leaving a shocked audience that was rooting for him in his comeback show . The next night a nearly demoralized Pryor had a smashing success , keeping the finale in its place and starting with the casual announcement , " Let 's talk about something serious . . . f -- -ing . " Obscenity : Which raises a matter that had best be dealt with now ? Pryor 's language . Both in performance and to a lesser degree in private conversation , his talk is generously laced with street-spawned obscenity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't offend me because , you see , I was raised around people who talked like that all the time . . . When I hear people not of my own color use the same words , they do n't use them with nearly the comfort or ease that Richard does . And until everybody uses those words the same way , I think there 's always going to be objection to Richard . " The key words are comfort and ease . Those homespun gallantries that rhyme with Donald Duck and brother-trucker can be ugly and repellent when coming from empty heads and hostile hearts . The late Lenny Bruce used such language for its shock value , to jolt complacency . Pryor does n't use these words to shock or titillate ; they are an inextricable part of a cultural speech , the speech of street blacks , that he neither patronizes nor exploits . These words are blue notes that he swings with rhythmic affection like a jazz musician . If he sprinkles eighteen of them through a routine , the odds are overwhelming that you 'll laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontation between Pryor 's immortal wino and Dracula , heard on the album " That Nigger 's Crazy . " Stalking the ghetto streets for prey , the Count is greeted by the fearlessly chauvinistic wino , who proceeds to lash out in juicy street lingo at the vampire , whom he sees not as the legendary monster but as a poor excuse for a black man with his silly cape , bad teeth and dirty , straightened hair . Pryor 's sense of language @# 49  | outrageous , lyrical , accurate ? is only one of the elements that make him a great comic artist . Even on records he can paint a vivid picture of the skewed reality created by poverty or racism , a reality that has its own paradoxical beauty . Pryor has plenty of anger , but he also has plenty of love , plenty of delight in his own creative power , and these elements unite to give his audiences a huge pleasure that reminds you of the similarities ? and the differences ? among great comedians , great preachers , great political performers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse passion in the response of his audience ? a hoarse , mechanical travesty of communal pleasure . When Martin Luther King Jr . preached his dream you could feel the hosanna in the surging bloodstream of his audience . When Pryor creates his winos , junkies , convicts , judges , macho men and bitch women , you can hear a kind of transcendent joy in the laughter of his audience . He gets not laughs , like Hope or Carson , but laughter ? a constant accompaniment that never seems to stop , but rises , falls , regat hers and explodes , forming a kind of rapids through which his comedy rides with surging acceleration . Agony : Jazz has been called the sound of surprise , but so is laughter . In " Live in Concert , " Pryor 's wife announces she 's leaving him . Pryor then shoots up her car , becoming the vehicle , an innocent machine wailing in high-pressure agony from its punctured tires . The cops arrive . Pryor : " I ran into my house ' cause they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine , Pryor 's pet monkey dies . The mean , vicious German shepherd next door jumps the fence to console Pryor . Dog-Pryor cheers up man-Pryor , then goes back to his yard , turning to announce soberly : " Rich , you know tomorrow I 'm gon na be chasing you again . " In one of Pryor 's greatest routines ( on " That Nigger 's Crazy " ) , a wino and a junkie meet . With amazing economy Pryor sketches in the social background of both characters : crime , prison , unemployment , sex . Creating the fatherly , perpetually sozzled wino and the childlike , perpetually spaced-out junkie , Pryor draws from you a laughter you did n't know you had , the sound of solidarity . A man who can make pain funny ? really funny , not maudlin-funny ? must have lived a special kind of life . A man who can become a lecherous monkey , a philosophical dog , a set of wounded tires , a bad body odor , a Mephistophelean cocaine pipe , must know a lot about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his growing up in Peoria , where his family ran a string of whorehouses managed by his grandmother , the strong personality in the family . As a kid he watched the whores at work over the transom without really knowing what they were doing . And he saw his mother sleeping with drunken white men and turning the money over to his father . Some observers have said that this account of his early life is a perversely romantic put-on . But , says Pryor , " I do n't give a f -- - what they say . It 's my life . Nobody would make up a story like that . That 's just the way I was born . And I would n't change anything . My parents were honest . They had great dignity . My mother taught me about being decent . " Paradox : To experience corruption and dignity in such intimate proximity explains a lot about the contradictions of Pryor 's life and art . And this moral paradox was reinforced by the racial paradox . " When I was little , " says Pryor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the color of the sun , I was orange . Then one day in school the teacher told me I was black and I was really upset about that . I said , But I 'm orange . ' And the teacher ? a white teacher ? said , No , you 're Negro . ' And I did n't want to be this Negro . I said , But I 'm orange , do I have to be a Negro ? ' " This reluctance to accept what seemed like an arbitrary blackness may have still been echoing in Pryor when he became a comic ? a comic with a very white sensibility . He had been started in show business by a remarkable black woman , Juliette Whittaker , who staged plays at a community center in Peoria and put the 12-year-old Richard in " Rumpelstiltskin . " " She believed in me , " says Pryor . " She showed me a way out . " The way out took a detour when Pryor dropped out of high school after a year and joined the Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he actually was a plumber because , as he said , " They looked at my IQ test and said this nigger 's too dumb . Let 's send him to plumbing school . " Once out of the Army , Pryor embarked on a grungily picaresque period as a young , joke-telling comic ? " I 'm the worst joke teller in the whole world , " he says . He played clubs and bars in cities like Buffalo , Youngstown and Toronto , meeting , along the way , female impersonators , flame dancers , gay wrestlers and a wrestling , beer-drinking bear . Floundering as an artist , he settled on Bill Cosby 's " white bread " style , playing clubs in New York 's Greenwich Village and getting guest shots on television shows . But what was natural to the gifted Cosby was unnatural to Pryor . Sun still did n't want to be black ; he was repressing his natural material . Then one night in 1970 he was onstage in his tuxedo at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas and he just stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I doing here ? " and walked out . Freed ' : He took a room in Berkeley , Calif. , and started to open himself up to all the experience , the characters , the style that he had been suppressing . In the next two years he changed from a performer projecting an image to an artist expressing a reality . " I read a book called Malcolm X Speaks ' , " says Pryor . " And I knew I was n't crazy . Someone else thought what I thought . And it freed me . I was n't gon na stand up there and wear a tuxedo anymore . There was something better to do . I got my head out of the white man 's dream . " Pryor 's career quickly became one of the 52 @# @# most complicated of any popular artist of our time . His reputation as a comedian skyrocketed with his new street-black style . Beginning with his 1972 role as Piano Man in " Lady Sings the Blues , " supporting Diana Ross as Billie Holiday , Pryor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . He was always better than the films themselves , exhibiting a vivid , unforced style as a black baseball player pretending to be a Cuban to crash the all-white major leagues in " The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings " ; as Wendell Scott , the first black champion race driver in " Greased Lightning " ; playing three roles in " Which Way Is Up ? " , and gracing other films like " The Wiz , " " Blue Collar " and the corny but sweet " Bustin ' Loose . " Some of these movies , including the worst of them , the abominable " California Suite , " made a lot of money . Meanwhile , Pryor , a superb writer , won an Emmy award for his work on a Lily Tomlin TV special and came a cropper on his own projected TV series when NBC censored some of his material , notably an opening skit in which he insists that he has " given up absolutely nothing " to go on TV and the camera pulls back to reveal an apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Pryor still won raves for some of his work , such as a parody of the intergalactic tavern scene in " Star Wars . " Artistically his reputation soared and the edge of his newly formed racial militance gradually softened . " At first , " he says , " it made me feel proud that white people could n't handle my act . But then whites would start coming up to me and say , I know people like that , ' and little by little I got more universal . " Pryor quickly built a huge cross-color constituency . " His fans run the gamut , " says Bill Cosby . " There is a staunch cult group with purple faces and green hands . You see some dudes with blue blazers and penny loafers sitting next to a cat who has just taken a needle out of his arm . When a guy does the kind of business Richard has been doing . you ca n't ignore it . He 's a 20-ton elephant . " In his personal life Pryor sometimes seems as dangerous as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pryor ? This Cat 's Got 9 Lives ! " ( Delilah/Putnam ) , Fred Robbins and David Ragan list more than a dozen explosive incidents , which include setting a girlfriend 's mink coat on fire ; beating up a Sunset Strip motel clerk ; having fist fights with his " Blue Collar " co-stars , Harvey Keitel and Yaphet Kotto ; spending ten days in jail for failing to file Federal income-tax returns ; being put on probation after shooting up the car of his then wife . Deboragh , and his notorious behavior at a 1977 benefit for the gay liberation movement , when he excoriated the crowd for cruising Hollywood Boulevard " when the niggers was burnin ' down Watts " and invited them to " kiss my happy , rich black ass . " In his book on comedians , " Funny People , " Steve Allen lists some more Pryor indiscretions : uttering obscenities on ... my God ! ...

" Pryor on fire " is now an American legend. - Two years ago Pryor was sit- ? ting in his sprawling Spanish-style home in the San Fernando Valley cooking up freebase ? a highly flammable mixture of street cocaine and ether . Suddenly there was a flash and Pryor was engulfed in flames like a stunt man in a disaster movie . Hearing his screams , his elderly aunt ran in and tried to smother the flames with a blanket . But the agonized Pryor threw it off . Running outside like a human meteor , Pryor was spotted by a passing patrol car , his shirt shredded , his upper body covered with patches of charred flesh , his nose a pink gash , half his mustache gone . " I ca n't stop , I ca n't stop , " Pryor called out to the startled cops . " If I stop I 'll die . " With third-degree burns over half of his body , Pryor was given only a 1-in-3 chance of surviving by the doctors who treated him . But survive he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profoundly shy , diffident man with a true gallantry of manner and a smile of blazing sweetness . He 's supersensitive to the fatuity that abounds in show business ; he ca n't stand pomposity and fakery and is especially impatient with commercial television , which he thinks " is for retarded people " : one of the things that bugged him on the Donahue show was a white lady who said she could n't understand why black people did n't like " Amos ' n ' Andy . " Pryor 's near immolation was a physical and spiritu-@#  | al apocalypse for him . In his bruisingly funny and moving routine on the accident in " Live on the Sunset Strip , " Pryor chews out his own false pride , bad faith and hypocrisy better than the Inquisition could . " Richard is very capable of bringing genuine punishment upon himself , " says his friend Burt Reynolds . " He seeks it out because like all of us he wonders if he deserves his success . But his vulnerability is a strength ? he actually tells you he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he was loved by everybody . That 's when all of America started to look at him . Suddenly he was doing more movies than I do and nobody does that . " But for Pryor the self-reappraisal was more agonizing than the pain . " Lying in bed in the hospital , " he says , " I had to think about why I was hurt , trying to find the truth . I had lived a life of pretense . I could see what a manipulator I was . I could play a victim at the right time . I never would admit that I played emotional games . I could n't think of any honest moments in my life . I thought I was a real deceiver and a schmuck . I said , You 're 40 years old and you 're a punk . Nobody knows you 're full of shit but you , and that 's enough . ' I started to cry . I said , I 'm sorry that I , Richard , did this to you , Richard ' . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreality . " My life seemed real , " says Pryor . " I got up every day , I walked around , I had relationships with people . But I never had a friend . I never was a friend . I had to face that . It hurt me . People loved me for my talent and stuff like that but I never let anyone get close to me . I 'd be much more honest onstage in front of thousands of people than I was with one person . " Just as Pryor remade his sensibility after walking off that stage at the Aladdin Hotel , he feels he was born again when he woke up on June 10 in the hospital . He 's mellowed on the race question . Where once he felt that whites and blacks " ca n't sing in harmony , " he now feels that " man is doomed if he does n't make a multiracial society . " One of his daughters by a white wife once came to him very upset . " She told me my grandmother was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma says white people are honkies . Mommy 's white . I ca n't hate white people . What do I do , Daddy ? ' " Adds Pryor : " It was so sweet . I hope she does n't lose that . " Pride and Grace : Pryor , who used to flaunt the word " nigger " like a banner of ambiguous pride , has said he 'll never use the word again , that " nigger is a word we give to our wretchedness . " Part of this impulse came from a trip to Africa he made with his wife Jennifer Lee , . at the suggestion of his psychiatrist . " It gave me a different outlook about myself , " he says . " For a long time I had the sense I was inferior ? which made me turn it into a feeling of false superiority . But being in Kenya gave me a sense of belonging . I saw black pilots , generals , diplomats , teachers , bankers , shopkeepers ? the whole spectrum . I saw the pride and grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up ? I saw a woman with Coca-Cola bottle caps in her ears . I felt my taste buds were different and my thought buds must be different , too . I was sitting in the hotel lobby getting ready to leave and a voice inside me said , What do you see ? ' I said I see all kinds of people . The voice said , Do you see any niggers ? ' I said no and I just started crying . " Pryor , who has four children by four different women , has new feelings about that part of his life . None of the children lives with him . " I really met them after I became famous , " says Pryor . " They 're much smarter than I am and they usually get bored when I talk to them . " As for women ? one of the great absorptions of h : life ? that , too , is going through changes " When I was making Some Kind of Hero . I watched the disrespectful way they were treating Margot Kidder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I treat women . Its funny how we idolize women and aggrandize them in commercials but with all that ' pedestal-pushing give them no real respect Why ? It 's fear . They know we 're not tough Of course , " adds Pryor with a grin , " occa- , sionally you do meet a bitch and you got ta call them like you see them . " And then he confesses : " I 'm in love with someone right now . I just met her and she does n't know it . I never thought I could feel this way again . I just feel things all over my body ; I ca n't get her out of my mind . I do n't want to say who it is because I 'm afraid I 'll mess it up . " Peace : So deep do the changes run in Pryor that he claims he 's seriously considering leaving show business " I 'd be in Zimbabwe right now if it were n't for these two pictures I have to do . " After " The Toy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackie Gleason buys as a plaything for his son , Pryor is committed to filming " Superman III , " in which he plays a villain who turns into a good guy . After that there 's the possibility of doing a film on the life of Charlie Parker , the great jazz saxophonist who died tragically as a drug addict . " My whole life has been show business but there 's more to my life now , " he says . " If peace of mind means keeping away from show business , then excuse me , Showbiz , it 's been a pleasure . Finito Bandito . " Pryor , who now lives in Maui . Hawaii , is looking forward to finishing his films so he can " lie on the beaches of the world and look inside and outside and read and write . It may take a year or two years , but then I 'll know what I want to be and I 'll be it . " He will not be alone . The coke demon that almost lured him to destruction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's OK , Rich . I 'll take care of you . ' I 'll hear him every day of my life . " With everything that 's happened , Pryor is still a violent optimist ; even the prospect of nuclear war does n't jar him . As he talks about it , he turns that prospect into a typical crazily sane Pryor number , a vision of post-atomic man " walking around with all sorts of crap hanging from his head . But the thing he 'll worship most is new life . I hear him whispering to a friend : So-and-so will be able to have her baby . A healthy baby . It has four beautiful eyes ' . " Richard Pryor is alive and well . @# @#
