The symptoms had begun in their early 30s for both men . First there was the mild stiffening of limbs and the tremors that mark the onset of Parkinson 's disease . Then came the gradual loss of muscle control , leaving them prisoners in their own bodies  --  mentally lucid but physically unable to eat , urinate or comb their hair without assistance . Levodopa , the most common treatment for the debilitating illness , had ceased to work for one man and could not be tolerated by the other . Nor were other drugs of use . Facing further deterioration , the two agreed to become guinea pigs in a remarkable experiment conducted at La Raza Medical Center in Mexico City and reported in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine . The results : one man , previously confined to a wheelchair , can now play soccer with his son and hopes to return to work ; the other is no longer incapacitated by incessant trembling and can speak clearly for the first time in years . <P> The procedure that brought about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from one of the adrenal glands , located above the kidneys , is implanted into the brain . Doctors have known for years that the symptoms of parkinsonism result primarily from the death of cells in a darkly pigmented part of the brain known as the substantia nigra . This region serves as a production center for dopamine , a vital neurotransmitter that helps govern such voluntary actions as walking and speaking . As it happens , there is another site in the body , outside the brain , that produces substantial amounts of dopamine : the inner core of the adrenal glands . By transferring dopamine-producing adrenal cells into the brain , Dr. Ignacio Madrazo and his colleagues hoped to replenish the supply of this neurotransmitter and thus restore normal function . <P> To Madrazo 's amazement , the effects of the operations , performed in March and October of last year , became apparent in a matter of days . In the case of one of the two patients , he noted in the Journal , " functional recovery occurred on an almost daily basis . " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one has resumed managing his own farm . The loss of one adrenal gland has not presented any complications . Nor is rejection a problem , because the grafted tissue is the patient 's own . Encouraged , Madrazo 's team has tried the procedure on eight other patients . They are " doing well , " Madrazo says , but it is too soon to assess the effects . <P> The transplant procedure was not without precedent . Beginning five years ago , doctors in Sweden tried similar surgery on four Parkinson 's victims . They achieved only slight improvements that soon faded . Madrazo credits his team 's success to modifications in surgical technique . The Swedes had transferred the adrenal tissue directly into a C-shaped structure in the middle of the brain called the caudate nucleus , where dopamine exerts its primary effects . The Mexicans , by contrast , used surgical staples to anchor the cells onto the exterior of the caudate , which is continually bathed in cerebrospinal fluid . This nourishing bath may have helped the graft survive . In addition , Madrazo says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predecessors .
