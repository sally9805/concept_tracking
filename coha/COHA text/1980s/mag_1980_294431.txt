A World War II diary casts new light on Tehran <P> At a concentration camp in the Philippines , American civilian prisoners and their Japanese captors held a party in 1942 for some departing guards , sharing sukiyaki and singing Auld Lang Syne . " They really liked each other , " Prisoner Natalie Crouter wrote in her diary . " The pity of it-that our enemies should tell us this-that prisoners in a prison camp have given them more fun and friendliness than they ever had before . How it lights up the poverty , the barrenness of their past . . . " For one night , she wrote , the Americans and Japanese " were just boys again , sorry for the mess we are mixed in together . " <P> At the time , the Tokyo press was shrieking about " white devils , " and Hollywood was churning out propaganda movies depicting Japanese as bloodthirsty primitives . But for the diarist , now 81 and living in Cleveland Heights , Ohio , the fact that Japanese and Americans were getting along at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englander who once worked in the campaign to free Sacco and Vanzetti , Crouter viewed World War II as a tiresome family quarrel , and not a fit activity for respectable adults . Her book ( Forbidden Diary , $14.95 , to be published next month by Burt Franklin &; Co. ) is remarkable for the interplay it creates between that view and the delicate Japanese-American minuet at the camp . In some ways , the book also sheds light on the ordeals of today 's hostages in Tehran and Bogota . <P> Crouter was a housewife in Manila when the Japanese invaded the Philippines in December 1941 .

As prisoners , they were far better off than captured GIs .

With approval of their captors , some 500 inmates organized the camp , setting up an adult education program that offered lessons in nine languages including Japanese-taught , of course , by guards . The Americans mixed easily with their captors and were even allowed to own knives and bows and arrows . <P> Still , no prisoner could forget his real status . The Japanese did not permit mail in or out , and the penalty for being caught with a radio was death . ( The inmates listened anyway , without getting caught , and heard the " news " that the Japanese had bombed Seattle and invaded Missouri . ) Though cruelty was rare , a Baptist missionary , aged 26 , was killed , apparently because the Japanese considered him a spy for China , and two men who tried to escape were tortured but allowed to live .
