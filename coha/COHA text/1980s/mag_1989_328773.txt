LET HISTORY JUDGE <P> by Roy Medvedev <P> Translated by George Shriver <P> Columbia University <P> 903 pages ; $57.50 <P> When Roy Medvedev 's momentous study of Stalinism , Let History Judge , was first published in the West in 1971 , readers marveled . How could a Soviet citizen , laboring in Russia , have produced a work so rich in documentation , so scrupulous as scholarship and , above all , so harrowingly vivid in its recounting of the calamities inflicted by Stalin on his country ? In the West there was nothing to rival it in scope . In the Soviet Union , where the book circulated among scholars , it restored a long-abandoned standard of professional integrity to Soviet historiography . As one Russian practitioner lamented , " Stalin beat out of us the capacity to think independently and to doubt , without which there is no search for truth .

Coincidentally , Mikhail Gorbachev 's policy of glasnost has nudged the door ajar for its publication in the Soviet Union ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the magazine Znamya . Last month Medvedev came even closer to acceptance in his homeland when he was elected to both the new Congress of People 's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet , the nation 's parliament . <P> Medvedev likes to quote another historian , Jules Michelet , who defined his profession as " the action of bringing things back to life . " Scarcely anyone does that better than Medvedev . All existing portraits of Stalin , even one drawn by a great novelist like Alexander Solzhenitsyn , seem bland in comparison with the real-life killer who charges through the pages of Let History Judge . Although the statistics amassed by Medvedev are overwhelming  --  he conservatively estimates that no fewer than 5 million Soviet citizens were arrested from 1936 through 1938  --  it is the telling human detail that brings alive Stalin 's
