Ronald Reagan has been President of the U.S. for 58 months , and his photograph had never made the front page of any Soviet newspaper  --  until last week . <P> Instead of the customary caricature portraying him as an American cowboy brandishing nuclear missiles , the front page of the Communist Party daily Pravda carried a shot of Reagan chatting informally with Gorbachev in front of a blazing fire .

Declared Boris Tchakarov , correspondent for the Sofia daily Zemedelsko Zname ( Agrarian Banner ) : " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East bloc news game , not only do you get no extra points for scooping the big guys , you might lose some .
