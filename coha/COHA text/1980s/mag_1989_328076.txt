When people have a heart attack today , they are likely to be given powerful drugs to dissolve the clots that block the flow of blood to the cardiac muscle . But the drugs are generally used only to buy time until invasive procedures can be performed . These include angiography , the injection of a material into the coronary arteries to identify by X ray the 1 patient in 6 apt to have another attack ; and balloon angioplasty , the threading into a blocked artery of a catheter with a tiny balloon on the end that presses plaque against the artery wall and widens the channel . <P> Now a new and controversial study has emerged to challenge this conventional treatment . Published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine , it concludes that immediate angiography and angioplasty , both costly and somewhat risky techniques , are unnecessary in most heart-attack cases . The 50-hospital study , sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and known as TIMI II ( for thrombolysis in myocardial infarction phase II trial ) , involved 3,262 patients who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attacks , all patients received a powerful clot dissolver , known as TPA ( tissue plasminogen activator ) , along with heparin and aspirin to inhibit blood coagulation . Of the 1,636 patients in the invasive-strategy group , 928 underwent angiography and angioplasty within 18 to 48 hours after their attacks . <P> The results were surprising : after six weeks , the number of deaths and repeat heart attacks were similar for each group , a strong indication that there was no advantage in having angioplasty . The study 's conclusions : angiography and angioplasty can be safely put off until patients show recurrent signs of a deficient blood supply to the heart muscle . <P> Not all cardiologists agreed with TIMI II 's conclusions . Dr. Geoffrey Hartzler of the Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City took issue because the study excluded patients age 76 and over , as well as anyone with a history of bypass surgery , heart-valve replacement , cerebrovascular disease , or other serious illness . " These were low-risk people , and it 's a bad rap for angioplasty , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no clot-dissolving drugs , is probably the single most effective treatment for acute heart attack . " <P> Nonetheless , the trial has enormous implications for the routine care of heart-attack patients . Community hospitals with well-equipped coronary-care units , for example , could offer the relatively simple drug treatment and send . patients in real need of angioplasty or bypass to specialized centers . If cardiologists adopt TIMI II 's conservative strategy , the estimated financial savings could total $200 million a year .
