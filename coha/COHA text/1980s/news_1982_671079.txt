Mr. Hinckley , looking boyish , neatly groomed and thinner than before in a light tan suit , sat expressionless through the daylong proceeding . He stood briefly to face the 90 members of the jury pool at one point while Federal District Judge Barrington D. Parker asked whether any of them knew him and his family . None did. // The 26-year-old defendant appeared to be wearing a bulletproof vest under his white shirt and brown tie . He is being held in a windowless cell in the basement of the Federal Courthouse here for the trial. // More than a dozen armed guards constantly watched over the courtroom and patrolled the corridor outside , making spectators go through metal-detector machines to enter the courtroom. // The task of selecting 12 jurors and six alternates , completed in a day in most criminal trials , is expected to take several days , largely because of the intensive publicity that has been focused on the case . <> <> Judge Questions Panel // At one point Judge Parker asked , " How many of you have not read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of the 90 jury pool members responded. // Jurors who have been exposed to press reports about the case will not automatically be disqualified . However , the questioning of the jury pool today , much of it conducted in whispered sessions with individual jurors at the bench , was designed to filter out those who have formed " opinions so firm and fixed that they can not be put aside , " Judge Parker explained. // " A juror need not be totally ignorant of the facts involved , " he told the jury pool . " What is important is that a person selected as a juror must be able to lay aside any prior impression or opinion , " he said , and base his decision in the case solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom and the judge ' s instructions on the law to be applied. // The law to be applied in the Hinckley case is particularly complicated . Mr. Hinckley has admitted , through his four attorneys , that he fired the shots that struck down Mr. Reagan , his press secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington police officer last March 30 . He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the 13-count indictment , and has cited his alleged mental illness in arguing that he did not act with " specific intent " to kill . <> <> Issue of Mental Illness // Much of the trial will consist of a battle between opposing teams of psychiatrists hired by the prosecutors and defense lawyers . They will argue over whether Mr. Hinckley had a severe mental illness at the time of the shootings and whether he had been deprived of ability to control his actions. // The list of about 130 potential witnesses read aloud in court today included more than 35 doctors , many of them psychiatrists . Of about 100 prosecution witnesses , 25 were doctors . Of about 30 defense witnesses , 12 were doctors. // The prosecutors ' witness list also included President Reagan . " In this case there will be testimony about him or you will hear testimony from him , " Roger M. Adelman , the chief Federal prosecutor in the case , told the jury pool. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there is any definite plan to have Mr. Reagan testify , however , and his testimony could be presented by videotape deposition rather than by an actual appearance in court. // In papers filed today , prosecutors also disclosed some of the evidence they plan to present show that Mr. Hinckley may have stalked former President Jimmy Carter and Mr. Reagan. // The evidence included a television videotape showing Mr. Hinckley " in a crowd approximately six feet from President Carter " in Dayton , Ohio , on Oct. 2 , 1980 , and evidence concerning his arrest for trying to take three pistols onto an airplane in Nashville , Tenn. , a week later a day when Mr. Carter was in Nashville . <> <> Hints of Prosecution Moves // The prosecutors also cited " numerous books , magazines , and newspaper articles relating to earlier assassinations including those of President Kennedy " and the wounding of Gov . George C. Wallace of Alabama . They said these materials had been found in the search of Mr. Hinckley ' s room in his parents ' home in Evergreen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonial courtroom on the sixth floor today included Bill Plante , a White House correspondent for CBS News ; at least two practicing lawyers , the wife of the chief judge of the United States Tax Court and several civil servants. // In general questions directed at the entire pool this morning , Judge Parker sought to find out such matters as which of the witnesses had personal relationships with any of Mr. Hinckley ' s victims , the attorneys or the witnesses. // Mr. Plante , for example , stood with a microphone to report that he sees President Reagan " almost everyday , " and has known Mr. Brady for about 10 years and reported recently on his prospects for recovery. // Mr. Plante was not immediately excused , however . Two candidates were dismissed by the judge , however , one for health reasons and the other because of the likelihood of bias. // The second stage of the jury selection process , called " voir dire , " which was nowhere near being completed as it dragged into the evening , involved close questioning of individual jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and court room clerks clustered around the bench. // Any potential juror who the judge decides would not " decide this case only on the basis of what transpires here in the court room , " as he put it , would be disqualified. // After that , the prosecutors and defense lawyers each will get to disqualify a number of jurors even if they can not convince the judge that they are biased. // Under Federal Court rules , the prosecutors may veto six potential jurors by such " preemptory challenges , " and the defense may veto 10. // One woman who said she had worked as a public defender here was closely questioned for about half an hour . The potential jurors were publicly identified only by number ; their names were closely guarded. //
