The initials " OK , " like a brusque mark of approval , are scrawled in the corners of a few of the best paintings of our century . They belonged to Oskar Kokoschka ( 1886-1980 ) , the visionary Austrian painter whose career spanned seven decades and not a few places of exile . Born in the world of the Emperor Franz Josef , he died in that of Reagan and Thatcher , just before the expressionist revival of the ' 80s took hold . Recent years have seen major shows of such expressionist masters as Ludwig Kirchner and Max Beckmann , and now the 100th anniversary of O.K. 's birth is marked by a retrospective at London 's Tate Gallery . ( The exhibition runs through Aug. 10 , and will go to Zurich in the fall and New York City in the winter . ) Comprising 241 paintings and drawings , with prints and assorted memorabilia , this will be remembered as the definitive Kokoschka show . The man it reveals , in his waxing and waning powers , his conflicts , insights and gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures of old modernism . <P> Some artists have a flair for creating maestrohood from a succession of scandals ; Kokoschka was one . Almost from the moment he left art school he assumed center stage in the Viennese avant-garde , enacting its fixations on love and death , abandonment and deviancy . Painting apart , he worked hard to earn his nickname " der Tolle " ( the crazy man ) . George Grosz remembered him at a ball in Berlin , gnawing on the fresh and bloody bone of an ox . He sometimes hid among the waxworks of criminals in the chamber of horrors of the Berlin Panoptikum , and sprang out with a howl to frighten the visitors . These early " happenings " ( artist as cannibal , artist as criminal ) were subtexts to the main theme of artist as primitive , untrammeled by conventions of any kind . O.K. 's letters were full of nostalgia for the innocence and vitality he felt had been lost to Europe under the crust of bourgeois sublimation . As an expressionist , he was one of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within himself . That this savage was the cultural artifact of the middle classes whose values he longed to escape was no mean irony . Kokoschka 's shenanigans failed to throw the burghers into the turmoil he hoped for , but they made an indelible impression on his friends , a circle that included the satirist Karl Kraus , the architect Adolf Loos and a galaxy of painters from Gustav Klimt to Wassily Kandinsky . His most eccentric episode was that of the doll . In the spring of 1912 he fell violently in love with Alma Mahler , widow of the composer and a pretentious man-eater . Their affair lasted three years , and she dumped him in favor of the architect Walter Gropius soon after Kokoschka enlisted in the imperial dragoons to fight in the first World War . This , combined with the horrors of the trenches and the shock of being shot and bayoneted nearly to death , drove O.K. over the brink . He had a Munich dollmaker construct a soft , life-size , redhaired effigy of his former lover , fetishistically complete in every anatomical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he would dress it up and take it out . In Self- Portrait with Doll , 1920-21 , Kokoschka is seen pointing with a woebegone expression at its sexual parts , presumably to indicate a cooling of the one- sided affair . Eventually , after he and some friends got drunk , he " murdered " the doll and flung it on a garbage truck in Dresden : the dumper dumped .
