Eliminating the opposition <P> Handcuffed and flanked by helmeted military policemen , South Korea 's leading dissident Kim Dae Jung , 54 , went on trial in Seoul last week on charges of trying to overthrow the government . Kim , once a leading candidate for his country 's presidency , has been under arrest since last May . Dressed in a baggy white suit , with the number 201 stenciled on his tunic , he looked haggard and subdued as the 154-page indictment was read . <P> Kim 's trial , which could last for several months , might result in a death sentence . His prosecution was clearly a key step in the effort by South Korea 's strongman General Chun Du Hwan to eliminate the last traces of political opposition to his rule . Two days after the trial began , figurehead President Choi Kyu Hah resigned . His successor , Acting President Park Choong Hoon , called for elections to be held " as expeditiously as possible . " General Chun clearly intends to simplify the choice for the voters . They will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands accused of raising money for the purpose of insurrection , with 23 of his campaign supporters named as accomplices .

Last week some 30,500 so-called hooligans and gangsters were arrested ; most of them were shipped off to " rehabilitation camps .

" But a growing segment of the financially strapped business community appears willing to put up with him . Inflation has now passed 20% , unemployment is rising and many bankruptcies have occurred as foreign investment fell off in the wake of riots in Seoul and Kwangju earlier this year . Longing for the orderly economic growth they enjoyed under an earlier strongman , the late President Park Chung Hee , many industrialists are reluctant to concern themselves with the fates of Kim Dae Jung or other Chun targets .
