When U.S. Roman Catholic bishops last year cautiously accepted public information campaigns about condoms to limit AIDS , the Vatican hit the Sistine ceiling . The text is being rewritten . Now Rome has another reason to be vexed , this time by the words of one of its favored churchmen . In a TV show on AIDS , the leading figure of the church in France , Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger , generally considered a pro-papal conservative , dutifully defended the church 's moral tenets . But then Lustiger , who was appointed Archbishop of Paris by Pope John Paul II in 1981 , added that those " who carry the virus and can not live in chastity ( ( should ) ) use the proposed methods . " That clearly meant condoms , though Lustiger did not utter the word . Last week in L'Express , he repeated his view . The Vatican made no immediate response , but one Roman official deemed the Cardinal 's lesser-of-two-evils approach " reprehensible . "                @ @ @ @ @
