txt HE FIRST SHAVE Is something special . Peach fuzz meets blade and the boy becomes a man . The first barbershop shave also is something special . Rough beard meets bar- ber 's straight edge , and the man becomes afraid . Not reaUy frightened , you understand , but uneasy . Most of us , after all , are accustomed to the du-ityourself shave , when the slip of a razor is a time r for cursing and bits of toilet paper , not a last will and testament . Then , too , many avoid the whole question by using electrics . 11,1 ** the turn of the century , when ICing Gillette had a better idea ? the double-edged safety razor ? ever-dwindling numbers of men have sought the hot towels , the mug and brush , and the sharp straightedge razor ..

History does not record if one had anything to do with the other . THE CHAIR IS READY . The neophyte reclines. and waits . The blade is honed on a small rectangular soapstone , then stropped ? the strap has canvas on one side for the rough finish , leather on the other to soften . The barber wears glasses . His name is Al Moss , and he is well known in these parts . For many of his 70 years he has been a barber . lie apprenticed with his father in Poland , then came to the United States in 1946 , where he opened Al 's Barber Shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , he sold the place 11 ; 2 years ago to Stan GaJewski , who changed the name to Mr. G 's .

Very few men ? maybe half a do- sen a week ? come for a shave , but Al says , " We do more than other places , because we give good shaves . " What makes them better ? " We 're old , ' Al says . He remembers when shaves were 20 cents . They 're now $5 , another reason many men eschew them . ( The $1 shave does exist , however , at the New Way Barber College , 1469 N.

" They 'd rather give haircuts , because with a shave you have to be very careful with the razor , and it makes you more nervous . " Oh , great , the neophyte thinks . A little slip of the wrist , and a promising career ends . The newcomer has seen too many movies . He knows the plot of Sweeney Todd , the demon barber of Fleet Street . He does not want a Sicilian necklace . BUT IT COULD be worse : For centuries barbers doubled as surgeons , their practice confined to minor operations , such as pulling teeth and something they 'd practiced unofficially since the days of Scipio ? bloodletting . The traditional barber 's symbol , in fact ? a striped pole with a basin hanging from it ? represented the bandaging of a bleeding arm . The basin was for the blood . Does Al ever slip ?

The Chinese , by the way , sprout the fewest number of hairs in the beard ? an average of 5,000 ? while the typical man goes 25,000 , and the German 32,500 . The normal beard covers one third of a square foot and grows about ash inches a year . No two beards are alike ; they 're as unique as finger . prints . It is not without trepidation , therefore , that the newcomer entrusts his facial fingerprint to the hands of a steady , but aging , barber . Al draws a handful of hot lather from a dispenser . " I remember in Europe , when we used a mug and brush , " he says . " The same one for F o r an infante the man in the chair recotsidets .

JUST WHEN the man in the chair begins to relax , the sound comes . Shoop-a shoop  --  a , shoop-a . It is the sound of razor against strop . The pulse quickens . Off comes the towel , on goes more lather . Al studies the beard a second . " You use an electric , do n't you ? " Yes . " I can tell . This is a tough beard , " he says solemnly . " Very tough . " There is a hint of doubt in his voice . Maybe this face was made for an electric . For an instant , the man in the chair reconsiders the whole thing . Suddenly the meaty fingers reach into the pocket , and there is the blade , gleaming silver , poised by the sideburn .

For centuries it remained an isolated practice , until Alexander the Great ordered all his soldiers to shave so they could not be gripped by the beard in combat . Another Great , Peter of Russia , taxed beards to coerce men to shave . Nowadays , it takes less coercion . In a lifetime , the average man will spend 3,3.50 hours with a razor . Some will be good shaves , some bad ? and some will be much closer than others .
