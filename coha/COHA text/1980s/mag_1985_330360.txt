Judy Collins , a mother who lives in Ventura County , Calif. , is fighting mad . " They are teaching kids the Pledge of Allegiance in Spanish , " she says , of bilingual classes at San Cayetano Elementary School , which her daughter attends . " It 's a United States flag , " she adds indignantly . " They need to learn that in English . " <P> Collins ' exasperation reflects the feelings of millions of Americans on one side of an inflammatory issue : bilingual education in America 's public schools . More than 1.3 million students whose primary language is not English are enrolled in federal , state or local study programs that provide instruction in their native tongues . These programs have their roots in the federal Bilingual Education Act , passed as a noble experiment in 1968 . Its original aim was to generate optional instruction that would help immigrant youngsters and native-born Hispanic-American children learn English quickly . Meanwhile , they were to move ahead in their schoolwork by using their own language as much as necessary . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Proponents of bilingual learning , however , see it not only as a way to help students with limited English proficiency ( LEP ) make the transition into the mainstream of American classrooms but as a means for preserving the students ' native language and culture . Today bilingual programs are conducted in a gallimaufry of around 80 tongues , ranging from Spanish to Lithuanian to Micronesian Yapese . Some of these courses are designed to maintain a student 's original language indefinitely , bolstering the language with enrichment studies in indigenous art , music , literature and history . The annual cost is well over $350 million . <P> Supporters argue that instruction in children 's native tongues is essential to providing them with an adequate education . " The Federal Government has a profound responsibility to these children , " says James Lyons , chief lobbyist for the National Association for Bilingual Education . But critics hotly question whether such expenditures are worthwhile . They also challenge the role of the Federal Government in favoring or heavily funding any particular method of instruction , much less sponsoring cultural-maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted into a vehicle for a bicultural approach to education , " says Robert Sweet , a member of the White House Office of Policy Development . <P> Bilingual learning , no longer just an optional classroom service , has become a fundamental issue of public policy . " It 's cultural , it 's social , it 's political , " says Robert Calfee , professor of education and psychology at Stanford University . Nationally , by some estimates , 3.6 million school-age youngsters are rated as LEPs , 80% of them Hispanic . The voting bloc represented by their parents has generated congressional support for expanding bilingualism into cultural maintenance . Even the White House is gun-shy about attacking the concept too vehemently , although the Administration considers it both inappropriate and wasteful .
