WASHINGTON  --  The Bush administration is asking Congress to close a number of corporate-tax loopholes to raise about $3. 5 billion over the next five years . If adopted by Congress , the changes would bring in nearly $800 million in fiscal 1990 , the Treasury estimates . The Joint Tax Committee of Congress puts the figure at $500 million . In either case , it is a small contribution toward the $5. 3 billion in new revenue needed to carry out the deficit-reduction accord that congressional leaders negotiated with the White House . The House Ways and Means Committee today begins drafting a bill to raise that money . The committee ' s staff director , Robert Leonard , told a group of lobbyists and government aides that the committee staff yesterday was still putting the finishing touches on a starting document , known as " the chairman ' s mark . " Speaking to the Tax Coalition , Mr. Leonard said the document won ' t include revenue-losing provisions sought by lawmakers that would extend or revive expiring tax breaks , such as the credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn ' t certain that the plan of Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill. ) to simplify the corporate alternative minimum tax will succeed . The latest version has made industrial companies unhappy because it doesn ' t provide much , if any , tax relief from the current law . The biggest single item on the Treasury list would discourage a parent company operating in the red from forming a special subsidiary and then issuing preferred stock of the subsidiary to take advantage of tax benefits that otherwise would be unavailable . This proposal would raise about $400 million in fiscal 1990 , which begins Oct. 1 , and about $650 million over five years . The Treasury also seeks to restrict the ability of real-estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash . Under the Treasury proposal , only swaps of properties with similar uses would avoid taxes . This and other limits on the use of property swaps would raise $200 million in fiscal 1990 and $1. 8 billion over five years . Tax breaks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the industry is likely to lobby heavily against this new restriction . The Treasury also proposes to raise about $100 million in fiscal 1990 , and nearly $600 million over five years , by repealing a tax break related to personal-injury cases in which settlements are paid out over a number of years . The administration , as expected , also is supporting restrictions on corporate-tax deductions for certain junk , or high-yield , bonds that are sold at a discount to their face value and don ' t pay interest in cash . These new limits would raise only a " small " amount of money , the Treasury estimates . The Treasury has also asked Congress to overrule a court decision that exempted Seven-up Co. from paying tax on money it received from bottlers to buy advertising for the drink . Accountants say the case is frequently cited in arguments that certain settlement funds and earnings on escrow arrangements aren ' t subject to tax . The Treasury says overruling the decision will bring in $76 million next fiscal year and $113 million by fiscal 1994 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs.  --  - Jeffrey H.
