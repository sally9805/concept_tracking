Hunting Cures <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Reading the story on disease detectives July 4 was a rewarding experience for a public-health professional . It is time that epidemiologists and other public-health workers receive the credit they have earned over the years , which is frequently given to the medical profession . <P> <P> Abb Janov-Litvack <P> New York City <P> Your article on disease control was fascinating , and your depiction of the AIDS crisis sensitively written . More frightening than the disease are the attitudes of some people in the mainstream of society . Comments like those of the Rev. Greg Dixon , who warns that America will be destroyed if homosexuals are not stopped , present a greater threat to us than any infection from a virus or organism . <P> <P> Martin J. McGlynn <P> Dedham , Mass . <P> <P> Any homosexual man who has had anal sex with more than 60 partners a year should not ask society to cure him of AIDS . Let the gay community fund the research for its own problems . <P> <P> Percy Wiley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how AIDS is giving the enemies of lesbians and gay men seemingly justifiable reason to perpetuate the discrimination that has been practiced against these groups . The unwarranted hysteria now taking place over AIDS makes it imperative that state and federal governments enact laws immediately to safeguard the rights of lesbians and gay men in employment , housing , medical care and social services . <P> <P> Allen W. Kratz , President <P> New Jersey Lesbian-Gay Coalition <P> New Brunswick , N.J. <P> <P> In your article , you left the impression that I had recommended that active homosexuals be " barred " from the food-handling business because of AIDS . Not so . The danger from homosexual food handlers is not AIDS , but the spread of enteric diseases ( the so-called gay bowel syndrome ) , several of which are epidemic among gays and are spread by contaminated food . <P> <P> Pat Buchanan , Columnist <P> Tribune Company Syndicate , Inc . <P> New York City <P> I find homosexuality repugnant , disgusting and morally wrong . However , the attitude and behavior of those , especially health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more deplorable . Homosexuals need help , not hatred . Whether AIDS is a scourge from God is not clear . What is evident is that sexual promiscuity is dangerous , and that danger must outweigh whatever transitory pleasure is gained . <P> <P> Scott A. Sterling <P> Austin <P> Sakharov 's Strategy <P> In spite of the problems involved in controlling nuclear weapons , as discussed in your article " A Plea for Nuclear Balance " July 4 , I believe there is very little chance that the major powers will engage in nuclear war in the near future . There is no conceivable advantage to be gained by any party in such a conflict . Instead , the first nuclear aggressor will in all likelihood be a relatively isolated country that is affluent enough to possess the bomb but perceives its survival to be endangered by some local dispute . More attention should be paid to controlling nuclear weapons in those areas of the world than between the superpowers . <P> <P> Kent Peacock <P> Toronto <P> Sally 's Sacrifice ? <P>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
