 | Faced with rising transportation costs , some thrifty South Dakota ranchers have revived an old Wild West tradition : The cattle drive . For cattle ranchers , the drive avoids the high fuel costs involved in trucking steers to market . " We saved about $12,000 , " says Wayne Besler of Bison , S.D. " The labor cost was almost minimal , and we may have saved enough energy to heat a small town . " For economists , it represents a new development in the American economy ? substitution of human labor for energy . Some experts say this trade-off , spurred by a 46.6 percent increase in energy prices last year , was responsible for an unexpected boom in employment in 1979 . Labor Secretary Ray Marshall , an economist himself , estimates that energy conservation created 1 million new jobs in 1979 , or about half of the total employment gain last year . " I 'm seeing it happen all over the country , " he says . " If you reduce the speed limit to conserve fuel , you need more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep from losing heat , you need labor to do it . " A slump ? According to Marshall , this phenomenon has helped reduce the economic disruption caused by higher energy prices . While some workers are being laid off because of higher oil prices , he says , others are being hired . That is one reason offered by economists to explain why unemployment has stayed around 6 percent , despite thousands of layoffs in some industries . Dale Jorgenson , a Harvard economics professor , says economic upheaval caused by higher energy prices should have eliminated 2.8 million jobs between 1973 and 1976 . Instead , he says , labor-for-energy substitution created 2.3 million new jobs ? producing a net job loss of only 500,000 . Labor Department analysts cite three ways that higher energy prices actually stimulate employment : People do the work of machines ; new jobs are created in the energy-conservation business , and oil-based materials such as plastic are being replaced with materials produced with more human labor ? wood , for example . A survey by U S.News &; World Report finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers and economists . An official of McDonnell Douglas Corporation in St. Louis describes Marshall 's theory as " farfetched . " An employe of Commonwealth Edison in Chicago calls it " out in left field . " And some truckers scoff at the notion that 55-mile-an-hour speed limits will slow them down . Cattle drives in South Dakota represent a direct people-for-machines trade-off . Rancher Besler says he recruited 70 cowhands last October to drive his 4,500 steers 75 miles to a stockyard in St. Onge , S.D. Fortunately for Besler , he had a big supply of volunteer labor . " Of the 70 cowboys , " he says , " I only paid four of them because they knew the country . The rest were volunteers who were tickled to death to be doing it . I guess my major expense was food . " Although he chewed antacid tablets the whole way , Besler spent only $3,000 to take his steers to market , compared with the $15,000 cost of using trucks . South Dakota 's Agriculture Department reports that the number of cattle drives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period when energy was too cheap , " says one rancher . " It was cheaper than labor . Now the situation is reversing , and energy is worth more than our time again . " Likewise , a nursery with 53 acres of greenhouses in Apopka , Fla. , began using people instead of machinery to pot its indoor plants . Howard F. Mickle , executive vice president of John 's , Inc. , says the change became necessary when he received electricity bills of $3,000 a month . About 25 employes were hired to do the work . Costs offset . Although Mickle 's electric bills remain high , his expenses are rising more slowly now . " Hand potting also gives a better-quality product , " he says . " It 's just like a custom automobile versus a production line . Foliage is tender , and handwork protects plants better than a machine . " Examples of people taking over for machines are rare , however . More common are new jobs created by firms dealing with energy conservation . No one knows exactly how many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the telephone directory now lists 39 energy-conservation consultants ? most of them established in the past two or three years . New jobs were created six months ago when the Atlanta-based engineering firm of Heery &; Heery , Inc. , set up an energy-consulting subsidiary . Company President W. Ennis Parker predicts it will be " the hottest growth segment we 've got , " employing 30 workers by next Feburary . Some companies put full-time experts on their payrolls for advice on conserving energy . At Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California , a four-person energy-conservation department cut fuel consumption by 14 percent in two years . " We could easily add another four people to our staff , " says the department 's director , Jim  | Waltz . " We have n't begun to scratch the potential . " Hallmark Cards and East Texas Motor Freight each have two employes working on energy conservation , and Daily Express , Inc. , Carlisle , Pa. , hired several new people to work in new company fuel stations . Says Daily Express 's Mark Fleischer : " We 're putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers can buy gas at less cost than on the open market . " Utilities now employ more people to provide energy-conservation services . Long Island Lighting Company hired 14 people to answer an avalanche of inquiries on how to convert home-heating units from oil to natural gas . Pacific Gas &; Electric Company in California has added 700 energy advisers since 1974 to teach consumers conservation . New jobs . Energy-conservation products such as insulation , weatherstripping and storm doors provide other new employment opportunities . Popular with manufacturers are heatrecovery systems like the one Union Carbide installed in its chemical-andplastics plant in Texas . Solar energy , now a **25;151;TOOLONG business , also means more jobs . Unlike oil refining , manufacturing of solar equipment is labor intensive . One expert says Americans may spend as much as 375 billion dollars on solarheating units during the next 20 years , with nearly one third of it going for wages . American Solar King of Waco , Tex. , which markets solarcollector plates , says sales are increasing by 67 percent a year and jobs nearly doubled in 1979 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , says he added five people to his sales staff to keep up with demand . " As long as sales remain as high as they 've been , I 've got to keep the extra people on , " says Gerow . Housing construction may have dropped , but Gail Cuculic of Enco Insulation , Inc. , Houston , keeps all of his employes busy by installing air-filtration systems . Sometimes labor substitution simply means longer working hours for the existing employes . Lloyd Rohrbach , manager of an office building in Indianapolis , says that he now brings an employe to work several hours early each weekday morning to raise the building temperature to 65 degrees after it is turned down all night . Cost in overtime wages is several hundred dollars a week . Delivery workers for Ridgewell 's caterers of Bethesda , Md. , are working longer hours now that the company has cut back from two trucks to one to save gasoline . Jeff Ridgewell Ellis , president of the family 's 53-year-old business , says the overtime pay helps the drivers cope with inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the minority . High-priced energy has caused thousands of layoffs , as in the auto industry . Economists also note that unemployment did not climb as expected , because an anticipated recession never materialized . Advocates of the labor-for-energy theory are reluctant to say how it might affect the economy in the future . Labor Department economist Nancy Barrett suggests the impact of energy prices on employment may diminish once conservation becomes a habit . But Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland predicts high energy prices will slow down farm mechanization in the future and save some existing jobs . Says Bergland : " Growers are finding that it might be better to hire workers . A lot of machines were designed to run on 30-cents-a-gallon fuel . " Trends in Labor Women win . Two ex-waitresses have won $275,000 in damages from a union local that allegedly tried to force them into prostitution and pornographic entertainment . The pair , Teri DeLoache and Karin Seritis , recently have been featured in newspaper and magazine advertisements paid for by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation . A state judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought work through Restaurant Employes Local 28 often were sexually harassed . OSHA debate . Senator Richard Schweiker ( R-Pa. ) claims union leaders are trying to smear him because he has sponsored legislation to limit the power of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration . A union coalition in Philadelphia charges Schweiker with a conflict of interest because a firm founded by his father was cited last October for health and safety violations . Schweiker terms the charge " absolutely false , a vicious and disgusting slur . " He insists he decided to introduce his legislation before the citation was issued . Organized labor is mounting a major campaign to defeat the bill , which would exempt about 90 percent of all workplaces from routine OSHA inspections . NLRB under fire . The National Labor Relations Board , which oversees the nation 's labor-management relations , now faces its own labor problem . A union representing 2,000 NLRB field employes staged demonstrations in late March at the agency 's offices around the country . The employes have been working without a contract since December 31 . A union statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law " that it enforces . Pensions pay . Nearly 4 million retirees received an average of $3,150 from pension plans in 1978 , a new study by the Labor Department shows . The report estimates the median total income for recipients of both Social Security and pensions was : Couples , $11,440 ; singles , $6,680.
