Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens , / Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens / These are a few of my favorite things . <P> When I 'm feeling sad , I simply remember my favorite things/ And then I do n't feel so bad . <P>  --  Rodgers and Hammerstein <P> Good writers , those two . Poetic , brief and accurate . George Bush must have been listening and working up his own version : <P> Old baseball mitts and spotted plump puppies , / Horseshoes that ring and bright smiling yuppies . . . / These are a few of my favorite things . <P> When my polls are bad , I simply remember my favorite things/ And then people feel so glad . <P> So far , Bush 's presidency has played remarkably like The Sound of Music . It might not have worked in the cold war , but that seems to be over . Comes an economic recession , forget it . But right now , in boom and blossom time on the Potomac , Bush has astonished the Beltway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a TIME/CNN poll , down slightly but still substantial ) . All the while he has been shrinking his nightly TV presence by as much as one-third compared with his predecessor 's , and often he is nowhere to be seen on the front pages of the nation 's newspapers . <P> How does a President stay up while going down ?

A similar finding from Robert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs is factual . He records all the network evening news shows and analyzes them . Bush 's presence is diminishing , that of Cabinet officers and other Administration spokesmen rising . The White House now is the focus of Administration news only about half the time , compared with 72% in the first days . " So far , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working . Bush gets less press but better press . Bush is far more visible to the press than he is to the public , just the opposite of Reagan , who was far more visible to the people than to the press . " <P> With the notable exception of the John Tower fracas , Bush has muted public controversy . He cut a deal with Congress to quiet the poisonous contra-aid issue . He tiptoed out of the Eastern Air Lines strike early and into the Alaskan oil spill belatedly . Twice in the past few days he has mentioned his admiration of the leadership style of Dwight Eisenhower , best known for his ability to reconcile contentious and talented people . " No room for grudges in this business , " Bush told one meeting of young staff members .
