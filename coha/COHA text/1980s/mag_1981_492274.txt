WHERE THERE 'S HOPE , THERE 'S LIFE by Jolee Edmondson tern that worked for me. - Hope 's daily schedule starts promptly at 10 a.m. , when he is served breakfast in bed . The fare is always the same : mixed stewed fruit , juice , a cup of decaffeinated coffee and a tablet called Surbex-T , a high-potency B-complex with 500 milligrams of vitamin C. ( " For 35 years I 've been gulping down the same vitamin , " he says . ) He then goes out on the trellised balcony off his bedroom and turns into a human chimp . Two iron rings dangle from a crossbeam to shoulder height , ready for his grasp . " What you got ta do , " he offers , " is just hang for about 30 seconds and let everything fall into place . And you move your legs around and stretch a little . " He started this exercise a few years ago because he suffered from persistent back pain . went to a bone guy , " he recalls , " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out disc . ' That really shook me up . I thought , ' Oh my God , here goes my golf game . ' So that night I told Richard , my masseur , that I had a disc problem and he said , ' Tomorrow I 'll put up rings for you . ' I hung on them , and I have n't heard from my back since . We 're built food turns into instant fat . I give it plenty of time to digest . I 'm still on Broadway hours , so I do n't call it a day until 1 a.m . I do a lot of reading and script editing at night . " My dinners are pretty light . More often than not , I 'll have my favorite meal  --  lamb with mint sauce , mashed potatoes and peas . No gravy or bread . I 've never abstained from red meat . I have to be very careful about sweets , however . I 'm a sucker for desserts . My biggest weaknesses are coffee and vanilla ice cream and lemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thinking about those foods . Sometimes I dream about going to meringue heaven . I really have to put a straitjacket on myself in that department . It takes a lot of extra willpower " ? something of which Hope has an overabundance . Beneath the breezy exterior lies a determination made of reinforced steel . " Bob used to be a fairly heavy smoker , " says his wife , " until his doctor told him to quit . I was overwhelmed at how quickly he was able to kick the habit . One day he simply held up a cigarette and said , ' See this ? It 's my last one , ' then smudged it out in an ashtray . He 's never smoked a cigarette since . We 've been married 47 years and his discipline is still a thing of beauty to me . " Part of Hope 's lightning-fast decision to cancel tobacco from his life style might be because three of his four brothers ( Sidney , Jack and George ) died of cancer . As for alcohol , the social companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to drink a lot . But I 've cut back so much that I hardly take a sip of wine these days . Booze really affects your productivity . We 'd get tons more work accomplished in this country if we did n't have that cocktail hour every evening . " Hope does his darndest to squeeze in a game of golf every day . Although he cruises the fairways in an electric cart , he insists that legitimate exercise is involved . " I only use a cart because it allows me to play more holes . Once I park it , I walk around a lot . And when the weather gets real warm in Palm Springs , I regularly swim five laps in our pool , which is huge  --  Olympic-sized . I feel like I 'm swimming the Nile . " Every evening at six he submits to a rubdown . It keeps me jumping , " he explains . " It revives me . " And just prior to bedtime he takes a two-mile walk  --  without fail , whatever city he 's in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepless night or why he is known for his ability to take a catnap in the back seat of a cab during rush hour when he 's 20 minutes late for a crucial appointment . " Where you or I would read or have a couple of drinks on a plane , " observes Allan Kalmus , the entertainer 's longtime New York agent , " Hope snoozes for four or five hours . " Bob Mills , 43 , one of the comedian 's gag writers , recounts , " In 1979 , he took us with him to tape his big TV special in China . Well , I took a tranquilizer so that I might relax on the plane and be ready for work when we arrived at our destination . But I hardly slept a wink . Bob , on the other hand , was in deep slumber the entire flight . When we got to China , he was completely refreshed and roaring to go , while his whole staff was done in by jet lag . We could hardly keep our eyes open , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch up with Hope , to his great dismay . " Interjects Kalmus , " I 've known Bob for many , many years and I 've yet to hear him say , ' I ca n't go , I 'm not feeling well . ' " Hope 's bouts with fatigue are so rare that they are instantly detected by those close to him . " I know when he 's tired , " nods Dolores Hope . " He 's not a complainer so he does n't say anything about it , but I can tell by the shadows under his eyes and his posture  --  he slumps a little  --  and he gets a bit edgy . Bob has always been extremely good about not letting himself get exhausted . " While the world around him falls asleep on Sominex , brandy , warm milk or a lullaby , Bob Hope , whose life in the fast lane of show business gives him every reason to be an incurable insomniac , slips into dreamland on pure peace-of-mind . He has relaxation down to an exact science . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one cause of tension . It causes more heart at- tacks and strokes than anything else . You always worry about the things you put off . They 're always in the back of your mind , festering and creating anxiety . Suddenly you 're overwhelmed by the matters you 've neglected , and that 's when you 're in trouble ; that 's when you toss and turn at night and start coating your stomach with Mylanta . I 'm a great believer in getting things taken care of fast . And then I reward myself with a little leisure . That way I do n't lose energy worrying . " When I hit a snag in getting one of my shows produced , I do n't waste time fretting . I do something about it immediately , and I try to remain cool . I snap my fingers , hum a song , get on the phone and get it done . No fooling around with extraneous stuff . " Not surprisingly , Hope also prescribes generous doses of humor to ease tension . Indeed , the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the very nature of his profession . " When I was taping my 30-year anniversary special for NBC last year , " he says , " I kept watching George Burns in the front row . I could n't help but notice that he had this terrific smile on his face and was chuckling through the entire show . He enjoys himself immensely . His work is his wellspring . This whole business of comedy is what 's kept him going . You ca n't do better for your physical being than laugh . That 's the greatest relaxant of all time . It makes valium look like a placebo . " Perhaps , in the long run , Hope 's flair for tranquility is innate , a trait handed down through the family . " I think it would take a professional to analyze why he 's so relaxed , " remarks his wife . " The way I see it  --  well , it 's a gift , like being able to play piano or paint . " All of this is not to imply that the entertainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , but such encounters have been remarkably few and brief , considering the amount of time he 's spent on Earth . He has n't had a cold in decades , and whenever he feels one coming on , he knows precisely what to do . " I take 500 extra units of vitamin C , a belt of Coricidin , and I hit the bed for about an hour . It always does the trick . " Hope is so plugged in to his chemistry and the intricate cogs that make him tick that he is almost his own diagnostician . While on the road , he treats himself with the care given a great sculpture being transported from the Louvre to the Metropolitan Museum of Art . His black book is filled with the names of physicians in the major cities he plays , and he follows the fitness rituals he adheres to at home . One of his infrequent ailments resulted from negligence while skeet shooting in the winter of 1979 . " I was firing the gun , and I forgot to put the plugs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to see the best otologist in Palm Springs . He really got me squared away . He told me never to drink coffee because caffeine constricts the little nerves in the ear . He also said I should take niacin . The first thing I do in the morning , before the stewed fruit even , is take 200 milligrams of niacin . Well , it gives me the flushes , but it promotes circulation and energizes those little veins in the ear . " Among his staff and peers Hope is noted for his uncanny recuperative powers . For him , a temporary setback is just that  --  temporary . He bounces back like a rubber ball off concrete . " Two years ago , I was in Columbus , Ohio , with him , " relates Gig Henry , Hope 's head joke writer . " Three quarters of the way through his show , his heart started pumping like crazy . It was so bad that he walked off stage . Soon we heard ambulances , and I thought he was dying . Well , the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating normally , and an hour later he phoned me in my room and said , ' Hey , I 'm going to be in Cincinnati tomorrow  --  need a few jokes . ' " In 1963 , Hope was struck by the only grave ailment he 's ever grappled with , the kind of affliction that ends careers , that is the deep , dark , unvocalized fear of all middle-aged men that can transform a vital human being into a cripple in seconds . As he recaps the day he fell victim to a form of stroke , a film washes over his eyes and his voice changes from the familiar lilt to a monotone . The experience is still very much with him . " I was sitting backstage with Jane Russell in Long Beach  --  we were doing a benefit there  --  when suddenly the theater started going around and around . I contacted a doctor , and he examined me and said , ' You have someone drive you home right away . ' On the way home , all I kept saying to myself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to fall apart . ' That was the longest 45-minute trip I ever took . " What happened was I had a hemorrhage in my eye , which is really a stroke . If it had hit me in the brain I would n't be here . I underwent surgery four times and lost 30 percent of my vision in that eye . I was overworked . I think that 's what brought it on . I was doing movies , a radio show five days a week , television and personal appearances . It just all caught up with me . I 've learned how to pace myself since then . As for my eye , I went to see a doctor of mine in New York a couple of weeks ago , and he says it 's fine , it has completely adjusted . I 'm a very fortunate man . " That optical trouble marked the first , and last , time he seriously considered retirement . Which brings us to the key question : Why does n't Bob Hope , who has achieved all there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch of the globe , succumb to luxurious idleness like any other self-respecting , 78-year-old multimillionaire ? " I truly believe that I 'd wither up and get old real fast if I settled down , " he replies . " Staying involved in work that I love is what keeps me young . Even if something debilitating happened to me , I 'd probably drift into semiretirement , never full retirement . I 'd do picture scripts or direct ing . " You know , I 've made a conscious effort to avoid the trap most people fall into after they reach 60 . All of a sudden , they think they have to start looking and acting a certain way . They think they have to slow down , so they do . It 's tragic how many fruitful lives have come to a standstill just because of the way we 've been conditioned to view aging . Most . Americans die before they die . " An insatiable desire for perfection also fuels Hope 's nonstop agenda . After decades of sold-out per sonal appearances and top television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gotten it right . " I ca n't shed that old vaudevillian philosophy that you 're only as good as your last show , " Hope says with a smile . " Basically , I still do one-night stands , and I always want to know where my next gig is . My whole life revolves around doing things better than before . There 's always room for improvement . I try to pretend that each show is my last show , the thing that I 'll be remembered for . " To this day , after each performance . this country 's most seasoned , celebrated and honored comedian walks off stage and asks , with the intense concern of a novice , " How was I ? "
