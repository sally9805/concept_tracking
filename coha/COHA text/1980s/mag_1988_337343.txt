KING LEAR <P> At the 1985 Cannes Film Festival , Minimogul Menahem Golan sat down with Jean- Luc Godard and , on a table napkin , jotted down a movie contract . Cinema 's old enfant terrible ( Breathless , Weekend , Hail Mary ) would write and direct a modern King Lear . Norman Mailer would play the mad monarch , Woody Allen the fool . <P> Guess what ? Things did n't work out quite that way . Allen , identified as " Mr. Alien , " does deadpan a bit of Shakespeare 's text . Mailer and his daughter Kate do appear briefly , but the novelist indulged in a " ceremony of star behavior " and left town . So Godard vamped . He hired Burgess Meredith to play a gang-lord Lear ( with many Mailer intonations ) and Molly Ringwald as Cordelia . And he turned the film into a cynical , pun-laden , nonlinear meditation on virtue vs. power . <P> " Are you trying to make a play for my daughter ? " asks Meredith of one William Shakespeare Jr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes  --  and the play he wants to make for her is King Lear . The film , though , could be called The Comedy of Eras . With his usual dour brio , Godard mixes allusions from five centuries of drama , painting , film . He presides onscreen too , speaking like a deranged Hitchcock , his hair a Rastafarian tangle of phone cords , stereo jacks and dog tags . The whole sport makes for Godard 's most infuriating , entertaining pastiche in two decades . It 's nice to know he is still making trouble , trashing the cozy citadel of narrative film .
