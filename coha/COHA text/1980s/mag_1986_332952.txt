Summer used to be the time when serious news took a holiday . Some readers grumbled that important issues went unmulled in all the concentration on summer 's zany trivialities . But no longer . In Moscow as well as Washington , public figures have decided that feeding news to the press should be a year- round occupation . <P> In an election year , when members of Congress might want to be back in their district politicking , they were busy on-camera deep into August ( television coverage now gives them priceless visibility back home ) , striking attitudes about South Africa and Supreme Court Justices and crafting the new tax bill . Over at the White House , feeding the 7 o'clock news is taken most seriously . The attitude is that if you do n't divert the press with themes of your own , the press will be asking questions you do n't want to talk about . So , in the weeks before Reagan began his real vacation in Santa Barbara , his press aides have been busy arranging symbolic non-news and photo opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen strolling to or from a helicopter on the White House lawn , shouting an evasive answer to Sam Donaldson , must seem to the Reagans not quite satisfactory enough of a 7 p.m. presence , and this inane scene certainly galls the press . White House stage managers have accordingly become adept at finding appropriate soapboxes and visual backdrops for the President , a series of Potemkin villages not to deceive a ruler but to catch the restless eye of his subjects . When Reagan worries about Republican defections in the farm belt , the presidential podium and the press corps are flown out to a state fair in Illinois , where he can speak against a backdrop of hay . Should there be a show of concern about the Middle East ? Vice President Bush travels to see the friendlies in Israel , Jordan and Egypt . The press was driven to analyzing not what the trip accomplished but whether it had any content at all . It was the White House that staged and stamped it as news and the press that went along for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of importance to the summer lull , are all too willing to play along with staged news , and thus share a complicity . President Reagan now has big-league competition in the creation of news , non-news and is-it-or-isn't-it news . Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev has obviously spent a lot of time analyzing not just Reagan 's positions but his techniques for putting them across . The Kremlin has shown a new adroitness in presenting its case abroad . Reagan and Gorbachev have spent the summer in graceful minuet , each moving a step forward or backward , finding + some movement , or none at all , in the other 's proposals , alternately expressing doubts or confidence that a summit is possible . To a Western Europe highly concerned about the nuclear race , the Soviets have seemed more genuinely interested in , or in need of , an agreement . Or is Reagan as usual holding back until the last possible moment to compromise ? After Soviet and American negotiators met in private recently at a dacha near Moscow , neither side blurted to the press . CBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , observed brightly that important things plainly had to be happening when such prominent people on both sides were gathered . But he did n't sound too sure . Sometimes it takes a while to learn whether non-news will really lead to news .
