Just about everyone knows that radio amateurs exist , that they are called " hams , " that they talk to each other over sometimes astonishing distances . But not much news about ham radio gets out to the public these days . Ironically , a lot of news gets out because of ham radio . When United Airlines Flight 232 crash-landed in Sioux City last month , ham radio operators rushed to the scene with two-way radios , called transceivers . Exactly what they did received little attention , because they did what they always do . " After any disaster you hear of , " says Stan Kuprianczyk , whose call letters are KA9VRU , " chances are , amateur radios will be present . When emergency telephone lines and commercial radio frequencies are tied up , amateur radio may be the only way to transmit emergency information . The Exxon Valdez oil spill was an example . It ' s a tenet of ham radio to help out in an emergency . " It was the same story in 1985 , when the great earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , through radio contacts with U.S. hams , put Mexican Americans in touch with friends and relatives in Mexico City . " When I was president of the village here , " said Angelo Polvere ( KA9CSO ) of northwest suburban Inverness , " I appointed a radio amateur civil defense director because really during a disaster the thing that ' s needed most is communications . " " All communication is fragile , " says Bruce Hillstrom ( N9BBW ) , manager of Erickson Communications , 5456 N. Milwaukee Ave . , Chicago ' s principal dealer in amateur-radio equipment . " Lose one tower , one microwave link , and you ' re out of business . But if there ' s a problem , the amateur has enough training to step in and get the job done . " When not responding to emergencies , radio amateurs perform such public services as stationing themselves along the routes of marathon running events so that athletes who collapse or suffer injury can be assisted in a hurry . Or they just talk about anything at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends over lunch , " says Hillstrom , " and people also form networks on the air , which means a spot on the dial where a bunch of hams get together on daily or weekly basis . They may talk about radio equipment or anything else . There ' s a Geritol Net , where older guys get togther and talk , a MidCars Net where travelers make contact with one another , and an RV Net where people with motor homes and campers make contact . There are hundreds of nets out there . " Although the American Radio Relay League-the oldest , largest and most influential organization of ham radio operators-estimates that about 500 , 000 Americans , including 11 , 000 to 12 , 000 Illinoisans , hold amateur radio licenses , hams who hope to see the hobby grow wonder where the next generation of radio amateurs will come from . The average ham , according to the ARRL , is a 48-year-old male with 15 years experience . Despite the participation of thousands of women and children-no age requirements stand in the way of obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that ham radio is largely an " old man ' s " hobby . " When us older guys got into ham radio , we didn ' t have that much to distract us , " says Texas radio amateur Jerry Stover , 69 . " Now they ' ve got television , computers , video-all sorts of electronic gadgets . And lifestyles have changed . " " The trouble is nobody really knows about ham radio , " says Steve Bosnyak III ( KA9ZZA ) , 15 , a Taft High School student . Bosnyak began the radio hobby with a Citizens Band ( CB ) Handi-Talkie so he could talk with friends but moved into ham radio when he discovered that often he could not talk to his friends through the clutter of overpowering CD signals and profanity . " Hams take turns on the frequencies ; they ' re more polite , " Bosnyak says . He was encouraged and schooled in the hobby by his father , Chicago police officer Steve Bosnyak Jr . ( N9CBE ) and other members of the Chicago FM Club ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , two of the Chicago area ' s best known ham organizations . The latter operates a relay station through which hams with small transceivers can communicate worldwide . " I ' ve talked to Africa , all parts of Europe and all over the country and made new friends through the repeater in the suburbs , " says Bosnyak . The Relay League spent more than $100 , 000 last year to promote the hobby through lectures and educational conferences . The league also has attempted to make it easier to get into ham radio and to begin communicating with hams all over the world . To broadcast legally , an amateur must obtain an FCC license by passing a 25-question test of radio fundamentals and basic FCC rules and regulations , and by demonstrating the ability to receive Morse Code at the rate of 5 words a minute . The League supports a proposal before the FCC to eliminate the Morse Code requirement . The proposal acknowledges that voice communication is by far the most common mode today , but many veteran hams oppose it , seeing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they point out , the first radio " amateur , " Guglielmo Marconi , launched the " age of wireless " in 1901 by receiving Morse Code from Cornwall , England , from his post at Signal Hill , Newfoundland . But the proposal gained strength when America ' s best-know ham , former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater , endorsed it . On Saturday , Sept. 16 , the League ' s first national Amateur Radio Awareness Day will attempt to spread the news of ham radio through exhibits and demonstrations in schools , libraries , town halls , parks and fairs . Although many hams privately fear that participation and publicity will not be all it could be , the league has offered to help local clubs set up exhibits through a Special Events Communications Manual and to supply promotional brochures the clubs can distribute to visitors . What visitors will not learn is how the word " ham " came to be . One theory dates it from the days when Americans first talked to English amateurs who added an " h " to " amateur , " producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knows for sure . A high-tech shack Calling CQ CQ CQ from KA9CSO . Standing by . Kilo Alpha Niner Charlie Sierra Oscar is calling CQ CQ CQ . Yeah , this KB4LUS , Newport , Rhode Island . We ' re playing with a new radio here . Amateur Radio Awareness Week has come early for a Tribune reporter in the home of Angelo Polvere , 59 , the executive vice president of Mayfair Construction Co . " I won ' t say this is a modest setup , " Polvere had allowed as he began with a tour of the antenna farm that makes his property easy to find-especially when his tallest tower is raised to its full height of 45 feet . What looks like an outsized fringe-area TV antenna , he explained , is " a beam antenna , which rotates for worldwide radio communications . Above that you can see a series of vertical elements-that ' s for 2 meter reception-local line-of-sight-and above that , the one that looks like an umbrella ; that ' s for 2 meters , 200 mHz. ( megahertz ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48-element J-beam for television transmission . . . . " Fortunately , one need not understand a word of this to know that Polvere ' s system can handle just about anything in the hobby . Inside is Polvere ' s " shack , " as amateur radio rooms are known . The size of a small bedroom , it ' s an incredible clutter of radio and TV equipment , this transceiver sitting atop that scanner and next to what appears to be a computer keyboard but in fact is a radio teletype transmitter . Nearby sits a " scanning variable frequency oscillator , " whatever that is . Still more dials and meters and blinking lights adjoin two color-TV monitors . One TV monitor displayed a logo , identifying Polvere and his station as KA9CSO . The " 9 " identifies him as a resident of the zone that includes Illinois , Wisconsin and Indiana . The rest of the six-part sequence says only that Polvere received his license ( in 1965 ) just ahead of ham operator KA9CSP and just after operator KA9CSN . Over the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shack in the basement , Polvere talked and radio teletyped messages back and forth to sailboats off Newport and Nantucket , a cruise ship in the Caribbean and hams in Vienna , Austria , and in the Ukraine republic of the Soviet Union . He explained that " CQ " is ham parlance for " Does anyone out there want to talk ? " On the walls of Polvere ' s shack was a colorful display of " QSL cards , " printed confirmations of radio contacts mailed from Czechoslovakia , Mexico , Brazil , the Principality of Liechtenstein , Norway , Israel , Hawaii , Geneva , Uruguay , Ecuador , Sweden and dozens of other places . A call to Andy Bachler ( N9AB ) resulted in a demonstration of " ham TV , " a live television transmission between Inverness and Ivanhoe , an unincorporated area in Lake County , Ill. , during which Bachler exhibited three QSL cards he had received after making radio contact with astronauts aboard Space Shuttle flights . " We ' ve got two more contacts planned for next spring , " Bachler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payload specialist on ( shuttle ) Astra STS35 . On STS37 the pilot expects to have some equipment with him . " Switching to another transceiver , the reporter was permitted to interview Hap Holly ( KC9RB ) , a professional musician and songwriter who runs the BEAR ( Broadcast Employees Amateur Radio club ) Information Service on a " repeater " ( radio relay station ) . Each week at 8 p. m . Wednesday on 145. 150 mHz . Holly broadcasts an information exchange for Chicago-area hams . No static for disabled In addition to attracting people of all ages and from all walks of life , Holly said , " amateur radio is a wonderful hobby for the disabled because it breaks down so many barriers . If I didn ' t tell you I was blind , " he added , " you would never know it . " For those who are paraplegic or quadriplegic , or those who are unable for whatever physical reasons to get out of the house , ham radio is an excellent tool for reaching beyond one ' s four walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind and deaf hams , which is beyond my comprehension . One deaf-blind ham in Massachusetts has the ability of being able to decipher Morse code by putting her fingers on the speaker . " " Every mode of over-the-air communication known to man is in the amateur world , " said Polvere at the end of the demonstration . All but one-the familiar mode of people screaming and cursing at one another . Perfect strangers that night talked like old friends , offering help with technical problems or with public service projects even before they were asked . At one point , Polvere used the phrase " ham radio fraternity . " " There are abuses , just as in CB radio , " said Hillstrom of Erickson Electronics . " But I guess people are less likely to take the trouble to study for an FCC license and to spend $2 , 000 , which is about average for a complete amateur outfit , just to swear at somebody .
