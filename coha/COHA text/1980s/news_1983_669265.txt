Now , the world is being reminded of the Antarctic adventures of Cindy Buxton and Annie Price in King Penguin : Stranded Beyond the Falklands ( CBS , Wednesday , check local listings for various air times ) . // Gleefully narrated by Orson Welles , this Survival Anglia photographic record of their life among the king penguins , elephant seals , and albatrosses is a fascinating tale of commitment and survival on the frigid , 120-mile-long island of South Georgia , about 1 , 100 miles from Argentina . It is a land of snow fields , glaciers , and gale storms . The women brought a ton and a half of supplies with them and managed to make themselves nearly comfortable in an old lean-to. // When the Argentines invaded the Falklands , about 1 , 000 miles west ( and north ) of them , Cindy and Annie knew their planned return would be stymied and they prepared themselves to await rescue by British marines as they watched their supplies dwindle and the weather worsen. // Meanwhile , they continued taking pictures of the delightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penguins by their orange spot ) love to be with human beings . They congregate in huge throngs on the beaches , flapping their flippers anxiously , waddling on their short legs , diving as much as 60 feet for fish . The female drops her egg on her own webbed foot , which will become the youngster ' s home for at least a month. // The film is full of seemingly simple good fun - but it is apparent that a great deal of skill was involved in photographing the creatures without interfering with their habitat and their day-to-day habits . Viewers can not help but come away from the film with a soft spot in their hearts for what is probably one of the funniest , gentlest , and most lovable creatures on earth. // ' ' King Penguin ' ' is certainly not a political film - the war is almost incidental to the wildlife . But the threat of military action cast an ominous pall over the wind-swept wasteland . Still , seeing ' ' King Penguin ' ' is almost as charming and delightful an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . <> <> Lunch with Cindy and Annie // Miss Buxton and Miss Price came to another island recently - Manhattan . And we shared a lunch that didn ' t at all resemble the dehydrated food they ate during their eight months on South Georgia. // Cindy Buxton is the daughter of Lord Aubrey Buxton , executive producer of Survival Anglia . She has made several generally acclaimed wildlife documentaries in various parts of the world . She is the author of ' ' Survival in the Wild : The Adventures of a Film Maker in Africa.

She tends to defer to Miss Buxton , who talks like the leader of the expedition. // Why the Falklands and South Georgia ? // ' ' I wanted to make a film on penguins first of all .

' ' They sent us a message saying they were going to pick us up , but for various reasons they were never able to get to us . We were nervous , because we were the only women around for 1 , 000 miles and we didn ' t know what to expect from thousands of soldiers. // ' ' So we waited . Meantime we kept taking pictures .

On the beach we looked out at the icebergs and suddenly realized that what we were seeing was a ship - a Royal Navy ice patrol ship . And then came the helicopters as they took back the island . By the middle of May we were home . With all the film. ' ' // Are the penguins as adorable in real life as they seem to be on film ? // ' ' They are very inquisitive , because there are no humans around . They regarded us as curiosities . They had no fear of humans at all . . . we were just neighbors . Strange neighbors . They came to us . We always had 30 or 40 penguins around our hut , watching us . Whenever we ' d walk along the beach , a dozen or so would follow us. ' ' // Miss Buxton , a serious student of wildlife , says there are 17 penguin species .

' ' They are huge - about 18 feet long and weigh about three tons . Very smelly , ugly creatures . Not aggresssive , though. ' ' // About 2 a. m. one morning , I woke up in the hut , ' ' Cindy says as Annie starts giggling . ' ' There was an unbelievable amount of noise - grunting and groaning . Annie was at the door - there had been an elephant seal sleeping against it . When she opened the door , the seal fell into the hut . We had quite a problem getting this creature out again.

I hope we have made it easier for female scientists to go there in the future. ' ' // Would they ever return to South Georgia ? // ' ' I ' d give anything to go back . The life span of a king penguin is 25 to 30 years . We might even find the same penguins there . I ' m not sure they ' d be waiting for us on the beach , though. ' ' // Where next for the two dauntless wildlife photographers ? // ' ' We ' re leaving in six weeks for Ascension Island , which is right in the middle of the Atlantic . It ' s a tiny volcanic British island with an American Air Force base on it . We ' ll be doing underwater filming of green turtles , sharks , lizards , and land crabs .
