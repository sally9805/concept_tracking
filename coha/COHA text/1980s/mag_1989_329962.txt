A guy walks into a Moscow bar and orders a beer . " One ruble , " says the bartender . " What ? " the man protests . " Last week it cost only 50 kopecks ! " <P> " Well , 50 kopecks is for the beer , and 50 kopecks is for perestroika . " <P> When the customer hands over a ruble , the bartender gives him back 50 kopecks . Says the bartender : " We 're out of beer . " <P> The Soviet Union 's farcical economy has long been the butt of its citizens ' jokes . A cynical sense of humor has helped Soviet consumers endure the almost full-time occupation of waiting in queues for necessities and the utter lack of quality and variety in consumer goods . But with the winter of 1990 approaching , even the thriving joke mill may not be enough to help people forget the grinding deprivation . The accumulated ills of the Soviet economy have brought it to the brink of collapse . Foreign analysts , along with a new breed of frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> At a minimum , Mikhail Gorbachev 's dual program of glasnost and perestroika may collapse if the downward spiral is not halted by the end of 1990 . At worst , the growing shortages of energy and food this winter could wreak social mayhem . " If we do n't see improvement in the stores , we will soon see riots in the streets , " warns a top Soviet criminal lawyer . " Anything could spark it . And the government would have to suppress it with force . " Among the signals of trouble : <P>  --  Economic restructuring has already cost millions of Soviets their jobs this year , pushing up the unemployment rate  --  as high as 27% in Azerbaijan , for example . <P>  --  An estimated 1,000 of 1,200 basic consumer products are in short supply . When Siberian coal miners went on strike last July , one of their most impassioned demands was for soap . <P>  --  Despite a grain harvest that is expected to grow 7% this year , poor transportation and storage will render 20% of the total crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union 's infrastructure is crumbling because of lack of maintenance . In the Ukrainian city of Lvov ( pop . 830,000 ) , citizens get running water only twice a day , for a total of six hours . <P>  --  In a Soviet poll , more than 57% of the adults surveyed said they had no confidence in the future . <P> The desperate situation is sparking an increasingly heated debate within the Soviet Union about the direction of perestroika . On the one hand are liberals , who think the country must move faster toward a free-market economy ; on the other are conservatives , who want any changes to occur so gradually that consumers will be cushioned from price increases and unemployment . Gorbachev is caught in the middle . The measured tempo he has chosen for perestroika has caused only economic disruption and hardship , at least in the short run .
