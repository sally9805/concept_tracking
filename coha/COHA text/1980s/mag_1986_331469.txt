Twice in 44 years , Gordon Hirabayashi heard the charges against him argued in the same Seattle federal courtroom . The first time was in 1942 , when Hirabayashi , now 67 , was a University of Washington senior who , standing by his rights as a U.S. citizen , defied an order relocating 110,000 West Coast Japanese to internment camps . His case reached the Supreme Court , where Justice Department lawyers argued successfully that the internment order was constitutionally based on military need and wartime urgency . Hirabayashi spent two years in jails and a work camp . <P> Five years ago , however , notes found in the National Archives persuaded Hirabayashi to reopen the case . In a 1942 report , the Army commander who ordered the massive relocation argued that it was not feasible to separate the " sheep from the goats " and distinguish loyal Japanese Americans . The relocation , in other words , was based on race , not urgency . The War Department ordered that racially prejudiced reasoning amended , and never revealed the original report . In essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. lied , and he overturned Hirabayashi 's conviction .
