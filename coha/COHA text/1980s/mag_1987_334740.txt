Few stage effects are harder to bring off for modern audiences than a manifestation of the supernatural . Try as directors may for some Freudian hallucinatory explanation of Macbeth , for example , the story makes little sense unless the witches are actual witches . This does n't mean the supernatural must be portrayed as exotic : the most chilling thing about those women might be their normality , as if they were plump , middle-aged matrons nattering across a backyard fence about their ability to conjure spirits . That very perception of character seems to have guided Geraldine Page in a less malevolent but equally necromantic role , the ghost-summoning Madame Arcati in Noel Coward 's larkish Blithe Spirit , which was revived on Broadway last week . The cast includes Richard Chamberlain , Blythe Danner and Judith Ivey , all in good form , but this is Page 's show . In a career including eight Oscar nominations , culminating in a 1986 Best Actress award for The Trip to Bountiful , and countless memorable stage performances , Blithe Spirit stands as a highlight . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have overdecorated many a characterization , here serve to heighten a shrewdly earthbound interpretation . Her Arcati is not dotty or otherworldly . She is a coarse , calculating businesswoman , a vulgar social climber , a tiresome , self-absorbed frump who just happens to be a medium with the gift of raising the dead . Her manner is so much the grasping fraud that the audience is stunned when she delivers the goods . Indeed , she is stunned herself : there are few funnier sights than Page striding across the stage in pursuit of a ghost whose presence she senses but can not see , snuffling at the wraith 's ectoplasm like a spaniel who just knows a squirrel is somewhere nearby . <P> This decidedly common touch is in keeping with Director Brian Murray 's sour vision . At the center of Blithe Spirit is a love triangle : smug , conventional Ruth Condomine ( Ivey ) is in love with her novelist husband Charles ( Chamberlain ) ; so is hoydenish Elvira ( Danner ) , his late wife , whom Madame Arcati accidentally materializes ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Most productions of Coward tend to be as glittery and brittle as spun glass . Murray brings the proceedings down to earth : these are not natural aristocrats but peasants with money and a veneer of polish , and when they mockingly meddle in the supernatural to gather color for one of Charles ' books , they bring chaos crashing down upon themselves . <P> By making Charles , normally a beau ideal , just as petty as his wives , Murray helps diffuse the unattractive misogyny shot through virtually all of Coward 's works . Still , this intelligent approach baffles some theatergoers and irritates others . It muffles many of the play 's laughs and , more troublesome at the box office , keeps Chamberlain from maximizing his easy charm . Yet audiences who come to see him may depart delighted at having seen Page in full cry , sloshing her drinks onto people , cramming her mouth with sandwiches , then abruptly divining where her seance went wrong with a fierce delight that would surely have bewitched Coward himself .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
