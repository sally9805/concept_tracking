 | When Mark Rothko wrote these words in 1949 , he had just begun to paint the hovering forms of luminous color that marked his work until his suicide in 1970 . His pictures were mysterious and elegiac ? he worried that the average viewer would be blind to their subtle emanations . " I am not interested in relationships of color or form or anything else , " he said . " I am interested only in expressing the basic human emotions ? tragedy , ecstasy , doom and so on . " The last thing on his mind was the physical risk of sending his paintings out into the world . He had no idea that his monumental work might be fragile ? that the delicate layers of thin pigment that he used to attain his shimmering effects were vulnerable to change . But a major suite of Rothko paintings , created in 1962 for Harvard University , faded so badly that for nearly a decade the five canvases were rolled up and put away . They were Harvard 's skeletons in a closet : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that probably few of the university 's administrators were able to appreciate . How did it happen ? Harvard is now coming clean . Last week the vast paintings , their colors irreversibly ruined , went on view at the university 's Sackler Museum in Cambridge . The show 's catalog unravels the sorry tale . After the two-month exhibition , the fragile panels will return forever to a dark storage basement where only scholars can see them . Rothko always believed that his eloquent paintings should be shown in groups ? to engulf the viewer ? and so he was driven to create a roomful of pictures that would reinforce each other . He made only two other such suites of paintings : for the Four Seasons restaurant in New York , which he then withdrew and placed at the Tate Gallery in London , and for the de Menil chapel in Houston . The Harvard murals were made for the penthouse of the new Holyoke Center , designed by Josep Lluis Sert , as a gift to the university from the artist . Harvard intended to use the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large that they arrived rolled up and were put on stretchers inside the room . " I remember how exciting it was to work on them , " says Marjorie Cohn , now a head conservator at Harvard . " It was like watching a butterfly come out of its chrysalis and gradually unfold its wings . " ' Rich and opulent ' : A 33-foot-long triptych was hung along one wall . The panels had wine-red backgrounds with forms that seemed to float on the surface ? one in brilliant orange , another in somber black , the last in a brownish tone . On the opposite wall hung two other panels , one dominated by dark forms and the other with pale pinkish bars framing a deep red center . " They were so rich and opulent , " recalls Cohn . " There was this glowing red . " Rothko came to a winter picnic in the room to celebrate the installation , and stood at the big windows , admiring the spectacular view of Cambridge as the sun streamed in . The murals faded rapidly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the color of stone-washed bluejeans . Against instructions , the special Fiberglas curtains were often left open . And the prestigious room was used increasingly for such events as crowded pre-football game bashes . The paintings were bumped by chairs and had drinks spilled on them . Someone even scratched a name ? " Alan C. " ? into one panel . But Rothko 's Deed of Gift stipulated that the murals could n't be moved without his permission or that of his representative . No one at Harvard could think of another place to hang the panels and , astonishingly , it seems that no one ever got in touch with Rothko . After his death in 1970 , the long , scandalous lawsuit that his children brought against his executors put the question of who could authorize moving the murals in limbo . Finally , in 1979 , they were put in storage . Why did the paintings fade so drastically ? When Rothko was asked in 1962 what kind of paint he 'd used , he casually said oil ? and that when he ran out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year Harvard conservators analyzed the paint and found that Rothko made his deep wine red by mixing ultramarine with Lithol Red , a pigment so light-sensitive that it 's no longer used in artists ' supplies . Rothko was not alone in his carelessness . " Most modern artists are notorious for not paying attention to technique , " says Sarah Fisher , a conservator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington . There 's no way of knowing how extensively Rothko used Lithol Red , but the poor conditions at Harvard were extreme . Dana Cranmer , former conservator for the Rothko Foundation , knows of no other Rothko paintings that have faded severely . Despite the grave loss of the deep reds , the Harvard murals still hold enormous power . At the Sackler , the five panels are arranged in a special gallery in their original configuration . The paintings ' subtle surfaces are still rich , and their looming forms have the somber majesty of ruined temples . And if the evanescence of the colors suggest that art is no more immortal than the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stronger than ever .
