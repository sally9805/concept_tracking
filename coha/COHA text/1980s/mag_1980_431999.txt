 | If George Brett were to write a howto book on hitting , it might go something like this . First tip : never think about the game ahead of time . Get to the ball park early , so you can work on your superstitions . " The other day I could n't find my lucky T shirt . I panicked . " When the game starts , notice who 's pitching , but do n't think about what he 'll throw ; it does n't matter . Step into the batter 's box and blank out everything . And , oh yes . When you 're standing on first ? or second or third ? take off your good-luck sweatband . Such is the uncerebral approach to baseball of the man who is threatening to become the first .400 hitter in 39 years . Pitcher Steve Stone 's instructional guide would be a very different matter . Always think about the game ahead of time . Take the phone off the hook . Lie down on your bed , close your eyes . Then pitch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least four times , plus a couple of pinch hitters . Do n't stop until you can envision pitching coach Ray Miller congratulating you on a complete game . The beauty of this approach , as Stone can attest , is that it helps turn a lifetime .500 pitcher into a crafty twenty-game winner . " I 'm a good pitcher , " says the Baltimore right-hander , who won No. 20 last week , " but not a great one . So I have to outsmart the opposition . If I go on instinct , I go to the shower . " Awesome Figures : These contrasting how-to books have had the same startling effect on the stat books . Brett 's figures are awesome : of the 85 games he has started this year , the Kansas City third baseman has hit in all but fourteen . But there were injuries . Twice before the July All Star break he hurt his right foot ? first his heel , then his ankle ? and had to sit out 37 games . Since the break , he has hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implausible slugging percentage of .751 . Not even a hitless night against Texas left-hander Jon Matlack ? ending a 30-game hitting streak ? could drag Brett 's average below .400 . The same night , Stone became the first major-league pitcher to record twenty wins . He prepared for the event with his usual thoroughness , shipping two cases of celebratory white wine to Anaheim ahead of time . " I hope the guys do n't mind , but I do n't like champagne , " he explained . ( He got a dose of it over his head anyway . ) Then he came within five outs of throwing a no-hitter against the California Angels . With the victory , Stone lowered his earned run average to 2.94 and kept the Orioles on the Yankees ' backs . " Without Steve , " grunted manager Earl Weaver , " we would not even be in contention . " Nor would Kansas City have run away in the West without Brett , though his unscientific assault on pitchers might raise the dander of the last .400 hitter , Ted Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Statistical comparisons are difficult , given today 's longer schedule , but Williams was batting .411 going into the last week of August 1941 , the year he finished the season at .406 . Brett is dangling at .402 . " I 'm going to have to put together a lot of seven-game streaks , " theorizes Brett in an unaccustomed fit of planning . " And not go more than one day at a time without a hit . " Media Event : Baseball fans are already figuring Brett 's odds . In his favor is Kansas City 's artificial turf , which can make hard grounders take unplayable hops . With the Royals sure to make the playoffs , Brett wo n't be called upon to sacrifice in close games . But unlike Williams , Brett faces bigger gloves and the designated-hitter rule that keeps good pitchers in the game longer . And there are other considerations . Whereas Williams bashed away unencumbered by TV cameras and every journalistic note pad in America , Brett 's life has become one continuous media event . " No sooner do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he complains . " It 's a guy from L.A. Thirty seconds later , it 's a reporter from South Carolina . A film crew for someone named John Chancellor called the other day . Chancellor ? ' I said . Is he like Johnny Carson ? ' I just do n't know how to deal with all this media . In the clubhouse , its embarrassing . The guys must be getting tired of this . " At 27 Brett has already established himself as possibly the finest hitter in the game , - this is no fluke season . Except for 1978 , when he played injured most of the season and hit only .294 , he has batted over .300 every year since 1975 . " As a kid I wanted to be like Brooks Robinson , " says Brett , " only I was left-handed . So I made Carl Yastrzemski my hero . All through the minor leagues I tried to hit like Yaz . But I was n't half as strong as he was . And I could n't pull the ball either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brett was hitting .200 at the All Star break when batting coach Charlie Lau took him aside . " You 've got some tools , kid , " Lau said . " But you 've got to change a few things . And it is n't going to be easy . " Power : Lau revamped Brett 's stance . By extending his arms at the moment of contact , at the same time taking his top hang off the bat , Brett learned ? how to pull the ball . By standing off from the plate and keeping his weight on the balls of his feet . he increased his power . " Charlie wanted me to raise my average that year to .250 , " recalls Brett . But we had to keep raising @# Photos g Richard Pilling 80 NEWSWEEK/SEPTEMBER 1 , 1980  | our goals . I finished the season at .282 . " Brett is not quite as conscientious about his fielding ? or life in general . Explaining his dismal 30 errors last season , Brett says sheepishly , " Sometimes my mind wanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it this way . Suppose those 30 pitches had been balls ? Then I would have had no errors ! " He also tends to forget at other crucial moments . Recently , he was backing his Mercedes out of his garage when he heard a wrenching metallic sound . " It was my door , " says Brett with a sigh . " I forgot it was open . " Free Beer ' : Off the field , Brett is one of those rare stars who believes his ego need not match his supersize salary , who can actually talk about something other than himself and who seems to play the game for the ? heaven forbid ? genuine fun of it . " Listen , " he bubbled one night , halfjokingly , " you walk into the clubhouse . There 's a rack filled with bubble gum , candy bars and chewing tobacco . There 's free beer in the refrigerator . And food after the game . What else could anyone want ? " For Steve Stone it 's a year like 1980 , a simple coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's just been waiting to happen . For throughout his nine-year career , he says , something always went a little bit wrong . He played for losing teams ? first the Giants , then the White Sox , the Cubs , back to the Sox ? all of which lacked the defense and the hitting a pitcher needs to win . Also , some of his bosses found him somehow out of step ? not so much a Yossarian as a well-meaning misfit . " One pitching coach told me I 'd never be a success , " says Stone . " He said I was too close to my parents . My manager in San Francisco said reading too much was n't good for me . He also thought it was suspect that I smoked a pipe . I knew early on I 'd never be one of the boys . " Potential ' : Except for three seasons , Stone was not a winning pitcher either . He was known less for his curve ball than for his interest in cuisine ? he was part owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1979 he joined the Orioles as a free agent . Assigned by Weaver to be the fifth starter , Stone was slogging along with a 6-7 record at the All Star break . " Suddenly I realized I did n't want to be a losing pitcher on a team that s was running away with the pennant . Somehow I had to give up the idea I was a .500 pitcher . The key was to translate my potential into performance . " So Stone took up the art of positive thinking . He even changed his uniform number . " Being Jewish , I always worshipped Sandy Koufax , " he says . " So I took his number . " Whether it was the mystical influence of Koufax 's 32 or Stone 's new metaphysical approach in the game , the mental pitch worked . Since then Stone 's record is 25-4 and he has lost only one game at home . " For the first time , it all came clear , " he says . " It was as if a TV picture had been @# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizontal . " There were still a few bugs to work out . " He was so slow on the mound , " reports shortstop Mark Belanger , " he was putting us to sleep . After every pitch he 'd take a walk around the mound . I finally went to Ray Miller in May and said , You 've got to get this guy to speed up ' . " Miller conveyed the message , Stone took it to heart and he won four straight . By early June he was 6-3 and about to get his third straight no-decision when he ran into an old friend in California , Ruth Revzen , a psychic . " Your season will turn around after you play the team in green , " she told him . " You will also pitch in the All Star game . " Ruth was right . Since the Orioles played the team in green ? Oakland- Stone has lost only one game . He also started in the All Star game and pitched three perfect innings . For all his mishigass ? his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prescribed music on the tape deck of his Porsche en route to the ball park ( " Gee , I 'd play it for you , but I 'm afraid it would make me jump out of the car and pitch " ) ? Stone is throwing one of the slickest curves in baseball , and he 's spotting his medium-fast fast ball , now timed at 85 mph , with strategic success . And like Brett , he 's not too jaded to enjoy it . " When you 're a nine-year overnight success , and you 're having a season like I am , " says the 33-year-old Stone , " well , it just does n't get any better than this . " 81 c Carillon Importer ..
