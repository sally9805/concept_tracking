Not one to ignore so powerful a lure , along with the promise of tomorrow ' s skiing , I gathered my gear and was off down the road toward Highway 82 , then left up Brush Creek Road to Snowmass . My last visit to this area was over 10 years ago , and it was obvious , even at night , that things had changed a bit . Along valley foothills once black against the night , were now clusters of private homes glittering like glass birdhouses . Further toward the village ( Snowmass is now officially a town ) , what had once been a few condominiums had mushroomed into what looked like a sparkling city in the darkness. // The plan for Snowmass , as far as I could figure , is fairly straightforward : the majority of the condominiums are clustered along the ski slopes with the village serving as a reference point . This makes door-to-door skiing one of the delights of the resort . But the simplicity of this layout can be deceptive , especially at night . Having talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand tour , it seems a good idea to equip yourself with a map with your destination well marked  --  before you arrive. // A light scattering of snow had begun to fall as we pulled into the drive of Crestwood Condominiums , a series of lodges clustered around a central office just a breath away from the slopes. // After checking in I got to talking with one of the porters and asked the inevitable question of new arrivals : ' ' How is the skiing ? ' ' His grin spread wide across his sunburned face . ' ' Incredible . . . 45 degrees . . . sunny and with powder up to your knees on the Burn . ' ' ( The Big Burn is a particularly popular skiing area . ) Listening to him , I was in raptures , visualizing great sweeping turns , powder spiraling in sparkling plumes against the sky. // Depositing the bags in the foyer of my apartment , the porter departed with a cheerful ' ' Good skiing . ' ' Rather than being disappointed about having missed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured there was probably enough left over for tomorrow. . . . // The next morning I wasn ' t disappointed when I opened the curtains and looked up at a Colorado blue sky and a scattering of new snow across the hills . Maybe the snow was not up to the knees , but it was fine for a start. // While the kitchen of my condominium was equipped with everything from blender to wire whisks , I hadn ' t had time to go out and get groceries or avail myself of the Crestwood ' s grocery-shopping service . So after suiting up with the usual long underwear , assorted turtlenecks , bib overalls , sweaters , socks , gloves , and hat  --  looking like a child in a plump snowsuit  --  I trundled up to the lobby and on to a buffet breakfast at the Stonebridge Inn. // Suitably fortified with scrambled eggs , hash browns , orange juice , and fresh melon , I snapped into my boots , stepped into the bindings , and was off to the lift to test ski skills more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Colorado . But skiing , as it turned out , is much like riding a bicycle  --  once you learn , it ' s not easily forgotten , it just takes a bit of reminding various parts of the body to work in unison . Fortunately too , Snowmass is a forgiving mountain. // From chairlift No. 2 , I looked down on rolling , wide trails and groves of aspen with branches still white from the evening ' s snow . Every once in a while , the wind picked up and shook the limbs , sending cascades of shimmering snow dancing in the sunlight . After warming up a bit on a trail named Velvet , it was up to Sam ' s Knob , elevation 10 , 620 feet , via one of Snowmass ' s 13 chairlifts. // With 1 , 400 acres ( the longest run 3. 5 miles ) , Snowmass is 15 percent ' ' beginners , ' ' 60 percent ' ' more difficult , ' ' and 25 percent ' ' most difficult . ' ' But having been raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slopes , much of Snowmass ' s ' ' most difficult ' ' seemed a bit relaxed to me . This mixture of slopes makes it a favorite with families of varying skills. // The Sam ' s Knob lift offers a great vista of Big Burn , an area that offers marvelous , wide-open skiing similar to that above timberline , and I looked a bit longingly at all that open space . But the wind whipped through my sweater and twisted eddies of snow from the treetops  --  and the lift to the Burn was virtually empty , a sure sign to stick to the lower , more sheltered slopes . It was just about lunchtime anyway , so any such weighty decisions would have to wait. // Skiing works up an appetite , and anyone who skis with any vigor is usually famished by lunch . At High Alpine , located at the top of lift No. 8 , I was pleasantly surprised to find some of the best food I had on my trip . There were ' ' veggie melts ' '  --  a light filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And instead of an old ski-line standby , chicken soup , there was cream-of-curry , squash , and mushroom soup . As I remember , I ended up with a pleasantly satisfying lunch for roughly $6. // Sensing something different here , I spent a few minutes talking with coowner Gwen Gordon , a smiling young woman with honey-colored hair and a baby strapped across her back . Along with her husband , George , she has been catering to skiers for years ; first at Aspen Highlands , prior to a recent move to Snowmass. // ' ' Snowmass skiers are looking for more than just the normal ski experience , ' ' Gwen explained as she played with the baby . ' ' They want to sit back , relax , and have a really nice lunch . ' ' Referring to the sit-down restaurant , aptly named Gwen ' s , where the menu features ideas gathered from the Gordons ' travels ( such as chicken crepes for cold days and avocado stuffed with shrimp for balmy days ) , Gwen explained their philosophy : ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they want to . ' ' After lunch , I stepped back into my skis and headed across the mountain toward Campground , first checking the map to determine the best route . Even taking this precaution , I missed the turnoff and found myself taking what I thought was a shortcut through my first taste of untracked powder . Gliding through snow-glittering aspens , skis floating , the run felt akin to flying . For the rest of the afternoon , I made runs at Campground , an area protected from the somewhat piercing winds . By the time the late-afternoon shadows had lengthened , I was ready to head back to the lodge . The following day the weather had closed in and it was snowing heavily , so I stopped early to lie in front of the fire  --  an activity I was determined to devote considerable time to . Another passing thought entertained a possible dip in the jacuzzi or sojourn in the sauna , but the idea of leaving the fireside curtailed any movement until it was time for our group to gather at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this establishment includes a lodge and restaurant . While I didn ' t have an opportunity to dine at the club , the management has hopes of shooting for a five-star rating over the next few years . After dinner in the village , it was early to bed in preparation for a day of skiing in Aspen . Waiting for the courtesy bus that runs regularly between Snowmass and Aspen , from 8 a. m. until 4 : 45 p. m. , a small group of fellow early risers were reveling in the sun and balmy breezes that promised to provide the kind of day Colorado ski vacations are made of . Fortunately , ski tickets between the two mountains were interchangeable to allow for this kind of impromptu ski agenda . It was obvious from driving along Route 82 that Aspen too had changed considerably over the past 10 years . Suburbia has spread where once-open fields and hills used to meet the expansive sky . But as one 20-year resident assured me , change was obviously inevitable , ' ' . . . and along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apparently there are some new controls on growth , as well as a lot of renovation of the buildings that now contribute to Aspen ' s Victorian charm . Another long-term resident , whom I sat next to on the Rocky Mountain Air flight from Denver , discussed the other side of the fast-paced , glitter-gulch image of Aspen as a place where superstars come to frolic . Beneath all these activities , he explained , there are still local people who gather at town meetings to assure a certain quality of life and a comfortable place to raise a family , as well as the uniqueness that was and continues to be Aspen . Slipping the skis from the pockets that lined the bus , we clomped along down the street , past card and book stores , clothing boutiques , and a mall where a rather ramshackle structure had once contained a bicycle shop . But the sun deck and restaurant at the base of Little Nell ( the mountain ) hadn ' t changed much . And when a waiter , dressed in a worn flannel shirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scruffy handlebar mustache and a certain cavalier air toward life in general took my order , I felt reassured . After an entirely satisfactory breakfast of eggs and home fries , I clunked across the bare wooden floors , swung open the door , and peered up at the mountain toward the top , where the sun was brilliant against new snow . At the top I took off down a trail to the right that was , in the words of an old skiing buddy , ' ' a piece of cake . ' ' The day was stupendous , the air bouyant and just cool enough ( 20 degrees ) ; so the snow was still crisp , edges held and carved on slopes just moguled enough to make things interesting . By noon , skiing felt like dancing . Nonetheless my skiing partners and I decided to eat lunch a bit early and miss the rush . So we skied down midway , where the deck of the cafeteria jutted into the junction of several ski runs . As we chose our way through the moguls , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decked out in fuchsia , topaz , and blue turtlenecks ; green , scarlet , and brilliant mauve vests ; and parkas . They looked like confetti scattered across the outdoor benches . As is often the case with things that are mulled over for too long before they are done , I had overestimated the vertical decline and the height of the moguls on Ruthie ' s Run . One of the most popular runs , Ruthie ' s is to the far right of the mountain ( looking up from the base , though it can ' t be seen from there ) . It runs right beneath its own lift line - a great arrangement for those anxious to provide a show and for those just as anxious to view good skiing . While mine was not a stellar performance , I managed to negotiate the whole thing with some degree of style . That out of the way , I took the lifts to the top for a glimpse of a sight that had been running through my mind since the last time I ' d skied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked through the building to the rear deck , where I stood breathing in the solitude and watching birds soar . Off to the east was one of the most spectacular mountain valleys I ' ve seen . As I gazed into the depths of these jagged peaks , washed with new snow , I found myself wishing they could stay that way  --  pristine and massive , yet so close it seemed you could step off the deck and walk among them . A final look that may have to last a good long while and I was on my way back to the slopes for the final run to join the festivities at the base of Little Nell , where fellow skiers sat , milled around , and watched the sunburned faces of their satiated compatriots , grinning their way down the final run of the day. // //
