40 THE WAR AND MICHAEL K by J. M. Coetzee War is the father of all and king of all . Some he shows as gods , others as men . Some he makes slaves , others free . T. HE FIRST thing the midwife noticed about Michael K when she helped him out of his mother into the world was that he had a harelip . The lip curled like a snail 's foot , the left nostril gaped . Obscuring the child for a moment from its mother , she prodded open the tiny bud of a mouth and was thankful to find the palate whole . To the mother she said : " You should be happy , they bring luck to the household . " But from the first Anna K did not like the mouth that would not close and the living pink flesh it hared to her . She shivered to think of what had been growing in her all these months . The child could not suck from the breast and cried with hunger . She tried a bottle ; when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a teaspoon , fretting with impatience when it coughed and spluttered and cried . " It will close up as he grows older , " the midwife promised . However , the lip did not close , or did not close enough , nor did the nose come straight . She took the child with her to work and continued to take it when it was no longer a baby . Because their smiles and whispers hurt her , she kept it away from other children . Year after year Michael K sat on a blanket watching his mother polish other people 's floors , learning to be quiet . Because of his disfigurement and because his mind was not quick , Michael was taken out of school after a short trial and committed to the protectionof Huis Norenius in Faure , where at the expense of the state he spent the rest of his childhood in the company of other variously afflicted and unfortunate children learning the elements of reading , writing , counting , sweeping , scrubbing , bedmaking , dishwashing , hasketweaving , woodwork , and digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huis Norenius and joined the Parks and Gardens division of the municipal services of the City of Cape Town as Gardener , grade 3(b) . Three years later he left Parks and Gardens and , after a spell of unemployment which he spent lying on his bed looking at his hands , took a job as night attendant at the public lavatories on Greenmarket Square . On his way home from work late one Friday he was set upon in a subway by two men who beat him , took his watch , his money , and his shoes , and left him lying stunned with a slash across his arm , a dislocated thumb , and two broken ribs . After this incident he quit night work and returned to Parks and Gardens , where he rose slowly in the service to become Gardener , grade 1 . Late one morning in June , in the thirty-first year of his life , a message was brought to Michael K as he raked leaves in De Waal Park . The message , at third hand , was from his mother : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and fetch her . K put away his tools and made his way by bus to Somerset Hospital , where he found his mother seated on a bench in a patch of sunlight outside the entrance . She was fully dressed , save that her street shoes stood beside her . When she saw her son she began to weep , holding a hand before her eyes so other patients and visitors should not see . 1 . Al . Coetzee hus written three previous novels . He fives in South Africa . These excerpts urn taken from his novel Life and Times of Michael K , to be published by Viking in January 1984 . Copyright 0 1983 by J. M. Coetzee . 41 OR MONTHS Anna K had been suffering from gross swelling of the legs and arms ; later her belly had begun to swell too . She had been admitted to hospital unable to walk and barely able to breathe . She had spent five days lying in a corridor among scores of victims of stabbings and beatings and gunshot wounds who kept her awake with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend cheering up an old woman when there were young men dying spectacular deaths all about . Revived with oxygen when she arrived , she was treated with injections and pills to bring down the swelling . By the third day there she was pleading to be sent home , though evidently not pleading with the right person . The tears she wept on the sixth day were thus largely tears of relief that she was escaping this purgatory . At the desk Michael K asked for the use of a wheelchair and was refused it . Carrying her handbag and shoes for her , he supported his mother the-fifty paces to the bus stop . There was a long queue . The timetable pasted on the pole promised a bus every fifteen minutes . They waited for an hour , while the shadows lengthened and the wind grew chilly . Unable to stand , Anna K sat against a wall with her legs before her like a beggarwoman , while Michael kept their place in the line . When the bus came there were no seats . Michael held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from lurching . For eight years Anna K had been employed as a domestic servant by a retired hosiery manufacturer and his wife living in a five-room flat in Sea Point overlooking the Atlantic Ocean . The wage was fair , her employers were reasonable people , jobs were hard to come by , and Anna K was not discontented . A year ago , however , she had begun to experience dizziness and tightness of the chest when she bent down . Then the dropsy had set in . The Buhrmanns kept her on to do the cooking , cut her pay by a third , and hired a younger woman for the housework . She was a , lowed to stay on in her room , over which the Buhrmanns had the disposal . The dropsy grew worse . For weeks before entering hospital she had been bedridden , unable to work . She lived in dread of the end of the Buhrmanns ' charity . Her room under the stairs of the Cake d'Azur had been intended for air-conditioning equipment , which had never been installed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbones painted in red , and underneath the legend DANGER-GEVAAR-INGOZ1 . There was no electric light and no ventilation ; the air was always musty . Michael opened the door for his mother , lit a candle , and stepped outside while she prepared for bed . He spent this , the first evening of her return , and every evening for the next week , with her : he warmed soup for her on the paraffin stove , saw to her comfort as far as he was able , carried out necessary tasks , and consoled her by , T stroking her arms when she fell into one of her tits 8 of tears . 0 42 Nothing that her son said could calm Anna K 's fear of what might happen to her if she lost her room . Her nights among the dying in the corridors of Somerset Hospital had brought it home to her how indifferent the world could be to an old woman with an unsightly illness in time of war . Unable to work , she saw herself withheld from the gutter only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull son , and , in the last resort , the savings she kept in a handbag in a suitcase under her bed , the new currency in one purse , the old currency , valueless now , which she had been too suspicious to exchange , in another . Thus when Michael arrived one evening speaking of layoffs in Parks and Gardens , she began to revolve in her mind something she had hitherto only idly dreamed of : a project of quitting a city that held little promise for her and returning to the quieter countryside of her girlhood , where , if she was going to die , she would at least die under blue skies . In the plan she outlined to Michael she did not mention death or dying . She proposed that he should quit Parks and Gardens before he was laid off and accompany her by train to Prince Albert , where she would hire a room while be looked for work on a farm . If it happened that his quarters were large enough , she would stay with him and keep house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To prove her seriousness she had him bring out the suitcase from under the bed , and before his eyes counted out the purseful of new notes , which , she said , she had been putting aside for this purpose . Michael did not report for work the next morning . With his mother 's money stuffed in two wads into his socks , he made his way to the railway station and the main-line booking office . Here the clerk told him that . while he would happily sell him two tickets to Prince Albert or the nearest point to it on the line , K should not expect to board a train without both a seat reservation and a permit to leave the proclaimed Cape Peninsula police area . The earliest reservation he could give him would be for the eighteenth of August , two months away ; as for the permit , that could be obtained only from the police . From the station K went to Caledon Square and stood for two hours in a queue behind a woman with a whimpering baby . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , one for himself . " Pin the train reservations to the blue forms . Take them to room E-5 , " said the policewoman at the desk . When it rained Anna K pushed an old towel against the bottom of the door to keep water from seeping in . The room smelled of disinfectant and talcum powder . " I feel like a toad under a stone living here , " she whispered . " I ca n't wait till August . " She covered her face and lay in silence . After a while K found that he could not breathe . He went to the corner shop . There was no bread . " No bread , no milk , " said the assistant ? " come tomorrow . " He bought biscuits and condensed milk , then stood under the awning watching the rain fall . The next day he took the forms to room E-5 . Permits would he mailed in due course , they told him , after the applications had been seen and approved by the police in Prince Albert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke the lock on the shed where the gardeners kept their equipment . He took hand tools and a wheelbarrow , which he trundled back to Sea Point . Working in the alley behind the building , he broke up an old crate and knocked together a platform two feet square , with a raised back , which he lashed to the wheelbarrow with wire . Then he tried to coax his mother out for a ride , Wearing her hat and coat and slippers , she shuffled out into the gray late afternoon and allowed Michael to settle her in the barrow . He wheeled her across Beach Street and onto the paved promenade along the sea front . There was no one about but an old couple walking a dog . Anna K held stiffly to the sides of the platform , breathing in the cold sea air , while her son wheeled her a hundred yards along the promenade , stopped to allow her to watch the waves breaking on the rocks , wheeled her another hundred yards , stopped again , then wheeled her back . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstable the barrow . He thought of building a handcart with a box as body mounted on a pair of bicycle wheels , but could not think where to find an axle . BEN LATE one afternoon in the last week of June a military jeep traveling down Beach Street at high speed struck a youth crossing the road , hurling him back among the ve-hicles parked at the curbside . The jeep itself swerved off and came to a halt on the overgrown lawns out-side the Cote d'Azur , where its two occupants were confronted by the youth 's angry companions . There was a fight , and a crowd soon gathered . Parked cars were smashed open and pushed broadside on into the street . Sirens announced the curfew and were ignored . An ambulance that arrived with a motor-cycle escort turned about short of the barrier and raced off , chased by a hail of stones . Then , from the balcony of a fourth-floor flat , a man began to fire revolver shots . Amid screams the crowd dashed for cover , spreading into the beach-front apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaking windows and lights . The man with the revolver was hauled from his hiding place , kicked into insensibility , and tossed down to the pavement . Some residents of the flats chose to cower in the dark behind locked doors , others fled into the streets . A woman , trapped at the end of a corridor , had her clothes torn from her body ; someone slipped on a fire escape and broke an ankle . Doors were beaten down and fiats ransacked . In the flat immediately above Anna K 's room looters tore down curtains , heaped clothing on the floor , broke furniture , and lit a fire , which , though it did not spread , sent out dense clouds of smoke . On the lawns outside the COte d'Azur , the Me d'Or , and the Copacabana , a constantly growing mob , some with piles of stolen goods at their feet , hurled stones from the rockery gardens through the great sea-front windows till not a pane was left intact . A police van with a flashing blue light drew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst of fire from a machine pistol , and from behind the barricade of cars answering shots . The van backed precipitately away , while amid screams and shouts the crowd retreated down Beach Street . It was another twenty minutes , and darkness had fallen , before police and riot troops arrived in force . Floor by floor they occupied the affected blocks , encountering no resistance from an enemy who fled down back alleys . One looter , a woman who did not run fast enough , was shot dead . From streets all around the police picked up abandoned goods , which they stacked on the lawns . There , late into the night , the folk of the flats searched by flashlight to recover their own . At midnight , when the operation was about to be declared concluded , a rioter with a bullet through his lung was discovered huddled in an unlit angle of a passageway in a block farther down the road and taken away . Guards were posted for the night and the main force retired . In the early hours of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beating through the broken windows of the COte d'Azur , the Cote d'Or , the Copacabana , as well as of the Egremont and the Malibu Heights ? which had hitherto offered a sheltered prospect to the east-west shipping lanes around the Cape of Good Hope  --  whipping the curtains , soaking the carpets , and in some cases flooding the floors . Throughout these events Anna K and her son huddled quiet as mice in their room beneath the stairs , not stirring even when they smelled the smoke , even when heavy hoots stamped past and a hand rattled the locked door . They could not guess that the tumult , the screams , the shots , and the sound of breaking glass were confined to a few adjoining blocks : sitting side by side on the bed , barely daring to whisper , the conviction grew in them that the real war had come to Sea Point and found them out . Till long after midnight , when his mother at last dozed away , Michael sat with his ears pricked , staring at the strip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When his mother began to snore he gripped her shoulder to make her stop . Thus , sitting upright with his back to the wall , he finally fell asleep . When he awoke the light under the door was brighter . He unlocked the door and crept out . The passage was littered with glass . At the entrance to the block two helmeted soldiers sat in deck chairs with their backs to him , gazing out at the rain and the gray sea . K slipped back into his mother 's room and went to sleep on the mat .... 43 ROSSING the city on his way to work , K rubbed shoulders every day with the army of the homeless and destitute who in the last years had taken over the streets of the central district , begging or thieving or waiting in lines at the relief agencies or simply sitting in the corridors of public buildings to keep warm , finding shelter by night in the gutted warehouses around the docks or the blocks and blocks of derelict premises above Bree Street , where the police never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had imposed controls on personal movement , Greater Cape Town had been flooded with people from the countryside looking for work of any kind . There was no work , no accommodation to be had . If they fell into that sea of hungry mouths , K thought , what chance would he and his mother have ? How long could he push her around the street in a wheelbarrow begging for food ? Their hopes settled on the permit that would allow them to leave the city . But the Buhrmanns ' postbox , to which the police would send the permit if they ever meant to sent it , was locked ; and after the night of looting the Buhrmanns themselves , in a state of shock , had been taken away by friends , leaving no word of when they would be back . So Anna K sent her son up to the flat with instructions to fetch the postbox key . K had never been into the flat before . He found it in chaos . In a wash of water driven through the windows by high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and crockery , withered pot plants , sodden bedding and carpeting . A paste of cake flour , breakfast cereal , sugar , cat litter , and earth stuck to his shoes . In the kitchen the refrigerator lay on its face , its motor still purring , a yellow scum leaking past its hinges into the half-inch of water on the tiled floor . Rows of jars had been swept off the shelves ; there was a reek of wine . On the gleaming white wall someone had written in oven cleaner , TO HEL . He righted the refrigerator , emptied it , swept the broken glass into a corner , mopped up some of the water . He filled half a dozen garbage sacks and stacked them at the front door . Food that was still edible he put to one side . He did not try to clean the living room , but pinned the curtains across the gaping window frames as best he could . I do what I do , he told himself , not for the old people 's sake but for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom with layers of sheets and tablecloths . He wedged cardboard over the window and switched on the light . There was hot water : he had a bath . In the morning he hid his traces , The postman came . There was nothing for the Buhrmanns ' box . It was raining . He went outdoors and sat in the bus shelter watching the rain fall . In the middle of the afternoon , when it was clear that again the Buhrmanns were not coming , he returned to the flat . 44 He began to spend not only the nights but the days in the flat . In a kitchen cupboard he discovered piles of magazines . He lay in bed , or lay in the bath , paging through pictures of beautiful women and luscious food . The food absorbed him more deeply . He showed his mother a picture of a gleaming flank of roast pork garnished with cherries and pineapple rings and set off with a bowl of raspberries and cream and a gooseberry tart . " People do n't eat like that anymore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs do n't know there is a war on , " he said . " The pineapples do n't know there is a war on . Food keeps growing . Someone has to eat it . " He went back to the hostel where he lived and paid the back rent . " I 've given up my job , " he told the warden . " My mother and I are going to the country to get away from things . We are just waiting for the permit . " He took his bicycle and his suitcase . Stopping at a scrapyard he bought a meter length of steel rod . The wheelbarrow with the box scat stood where he had abandoned it in the alley behind the fiats ; now he returned to the project of making a cart with wheels from his bicycle in which to take his mother for walks . But though the wheel bearings slid smoothly over the new axlerod. he had no way of preventing the wheels from spinning off . For hours he struggled without success to make clips out of wire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he told himself , and left the bicycle dismantled on the Buhrmann 's kitchen floor .... One morning Michael K started up at the scrape of the front-door lock and found himself facing four men in overalls , who pushed past him without a word and set about clearing the flat of its contents . Hastily he moved the pieces of his bicycle out of their way . His mother shuffled out in her housecoat and stopped one of the men on the stairs . " Where 's the boss ? Where 's Mr. Buhrmann ? " she asked . The man shrugged . K went out into the street and spoke to the driver of the van . " Are you from Mr. Buhrmann ? " he asked . " What does it look like , man , " said the driver . Michael helped his mother back into bed . " What I do n't understand , " she said , " is why they do n't let me know anything . What must I do if someone knocks on the door and says I must clear out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where must I go ? " For a long while he sat beside her stroking her arm , listening to her lament . Then he took the two bicycle wheels and the steel rod and his tools out into the alley and sat down in a patch of sunlight to confront anew the problem of how to prevent the wheels from spinning off the axle . He worked all afternoon ; by evening , using a hacksaw blade , he had painstakingly incised a thread down either end of the rod , along which lie could wind clumps of one-inch washers . With the wheels mounted on the rod between the washers , it was only a matter of tightening loop after loop of wire aroundthe rod to hold the washers flush against the wheels and the problem seemed to be solved . He barely ate or slept that night , so impatient was he to get on with his work . In the morning he broke down the old barrow platform-seat and rebuilt it as a narrow three-sided box with two long handles , which he wired in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , though hardly of sturdy build , would take his mother 's weight ; and the same evening , when a cold wind from the northwest had driven all but the hardiest promenaders indoors , he was again able to take his mother , wrapped in coat and blanket , for a sea-front ride that brought a smile to her lips . ow WAS the time . No sooner had they returned to the room than he came out with the plan he had been pondering ever since building the first barrow . They were wasting their time waiting for permits , he said . The permits would never come . And without permits they could not leave by train . Any day now they would be expelled from the room . Would she therefore not allow him to take her to Prince Albert in the cart ? She had seen for herself how comfortable it was . The damp weather was not good for her , nor was the unending worry about the future . Once settled in Prince Albert she would quickly recover her health . At most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People were decent , people would stop and give them lifts . For hours he argued with her , surprising himself with his adroitness . So persuasive was he that finally Anna K yielded , though on two conditions : that he make a last visit to the police to find out about the permits that had not come , and that she ready herself for the journey without being hurried . Joyfully Michael acceded . Next morning , instead of waiting for a bus that might never come , he jogged from Sea Point to the city along the main road , taking pleasure in the soundness of his heart , the strength of his limbs . There were already scores of people queuing under the sign HERVESTIG1NG  --  RELOCATION ; it was an hour before he found himself at the counter facing a policewoman with wary eyes . He held out the two train tickets . " I just want to ask if the permit has come through , " he asked . She pushed the familiar forms toward him . " Fill in the forms and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . " She glanced over K 's shoulder to the man behind him . " Yes ? " " No , " said K , struggling to regain her attention " I already applied for the permit . All I want to know is , has the permit come ? " " Before you can have a permit you must have reservation ! Have you got a reservation ? When i it for ? " " August 18 . But my mother ? " 45 " August 18 is a month away ! If you applied for a permit and the permit is granted , the permit will come , the permit will be sent to your address ! Next ! " " But that is what I want to know ! Because if the permit is n't going to come I must make other plans . My mother is sick ? " The policewoman slapped the counter to still him . " Do n't waste my time ! I am telling you for the last time , if the permit is granted the permit will come ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand ? Are you an idiot ? Next ! " She braced herself against the counter and glared pointedly over K 's shoulder : " Yes , you , next ! " But K did not budge . He was breathing fast , his eyes stared . Reluctantly the policewoman turned back to him , to the thin mustache and the naked lip flesh it did not hide . " Next ! " she said . An hour before dawn the next day K roused his mother and , while she dressed , packed the cart , padding the box with blankets and cushions and lashing the suitcase across the shafts . The cart now had a hood of black plastic sheeting that made it look like a tall perambulator . When his mother saw it she stopped and shook her head . " I do n't know , I do n't know , I do n't know , " she said . He had to coax her to get in ; it took a long time . The cart was not really big enough , he realized : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the canopy , unable to move her limbs . Over her legs he spread a blanket , then piled on that a packet of food , the paraffin stove and a bottle of fuel packed in a box , odds and ends of clothing . A light winked on in the flats next door . They could hear the waves breaking on the rocks . " Just a day or two , " he whispered , " then we 'll be there . Do n't move too much from side to side if you can help it . " She nodded but continued to hide her face in her woolen gloves . He bent toward her . " Do you want to stay , Ma ? " he said . " If you want to stay we can stay . " She shook her head . So he put on his cap , lifted the handles , and wheeled the cart out on the misty road . H. K HAD NOT EATEN for two days , since he 'd left Stellenbosch ; however , there seemed no limit to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mist and he heard voices . As he came closer the smell of frying bacon made his stomach churn . There were men standing around a fire keeping warm . At his approach they stopped talking and stared at him . He touched his beret but no one responded . He passed them , passed a second roadside fire , passed a column of vehicles parked head to tail with their lights on , and then came upon the reason for the stoppage . Lying on its side , blocking the road , its rearmost wheels hanging over the lip of the gorge , was an articulated truck painted a blank eggshell blue . The cab wasburned out , the van blackened with smoke . Another truck , loaded with sacks , had collided with the wreck , and bursts of white flour marked the road . Backed up around the bend as far as K could see was the rest of the convoy . Two radios played loudly on competing stations ; from up ahead came the forlorn bleating of sheep . K thought for a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was not sure what he would do with it . He plodded past truck after truck ; he passed the truckload of sheep , packed so tight that some stood on their hind legs ; he passed a group of soldiers around a fire who paid no attention to him . At the rear of the convoy two beacons stood flashing , and further on a tar bucket burned in the middle of the road , tended by no one . Once the convoy was behind him K relaxed , thinking he was free ; but at the next bend in the road a soldier in camouflage uniform stepped from behind the bushes pointing an automatic rifle at his heart , K stopped in his tracks . The soldier lowered his rifle again . Now , K judged , it pointed at his face , or at his throat . " So who are you ? " said the soldier . " Where do you think you are going ? " About to reply , K was cut short . " Show me , " said the soldier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were out of sight of the convoy , though faint music still came on the air . K lifted the suitcase off his shoulder and opened it . The soldier waved him back , pinched out his cigarette , and in a single movement overturned the case . All his mother 's things lay there in the road : the blue felt slippers , the white bloomers , the pink plastic bottle of calamine lotion , the brown bottle of pills , the fawn plastic handbag , the floral scarf , the scallop-rim scarf , the black woolen coat , the jewelry box , the brown skirt , the green blouse , the shoes , the other underwear , the brown paper packets , the white plastic packet , the coffee tin that rattled , the talcum powder , handkerchiefs , letters , photographs , the box of ashes . K did not stir . " Where did you steal all this ? " said the soldier . " You 're a thief , are n't you ? A thief running away over the mountains . " He prodded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He touched the jewelry box . He touched the coffee tin . He touched the other box . " Show me , " he said , and stepped back . K opened the coffee tin . It contained curtain rings . He held them out in the palm of his hand , then poured them back into the tin and closed it . He opened the jewelry box and held it out . His heart thundered in his chest . The soldier stirred the contents around , picked out a brooch , and stood back . He was smiling . K closed the box . He opened the handbag and held it out gaping . The soldier gestured . K emptied it on the road . There was a handkerchief , a comb and mirror , a powder compact , and the two purses . The soldier pointed and K handed him the purses . He slipped them into his 46 tunic pocket . K licked his bps . " That 's not my money , " he said thickly . " That 's my mother 's money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true : his mother had died in the hospital , she had no need of money . Nevertheless . There was a silence . " What do you think the war is for ? " K said . " For taking other people 's money ? " " What do you think the war is for , " said the soldier , parodying the movements of K 's mouth . " Thief . Watch it . You could be lying in the bushes with flies all over you . Do n't you tell me about war . " He pointed his gun at the box of ashes . " Show me , " he said . K took off the lid and held out the box . The soldier peered at the plastic bag . " What 's that stuff ? " he said . " Ash , " said K. His voice was steadier now . " Open it , " said the soldier . K opened the bag . The soldier took a pinch and smelled it cautiously . " Jesus , " he said . His eyes met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things back into the suitcase . The soldier stood aside . " So can I go now ? " said K. " Papers in order  --  you can go , " said the soldier . K hoisted the stick with the suitcase onto his shoulder . " Just a minute , just a minute , " said the soldier . He took one of the purses from his pocket , peeled a brown ten-rand note from the roll , and flicked it in K 's direction . " Tip , " he said . " Buy yourself an ice cream . " K came back and picked up the note . Then he set off again , In a minute or two the soldier had receded into the mist . It did not seem to him that he had been a coward . Nevertheless , a little further on it struck him that there was no point in keeping the suitcase now . He clambered up a slope and left it in the bushes , retaining only the black coat , for the cold , and the box of ashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall and the sun scorch and the insects gnaw , if they wanted to , without hindrance . N THE MORNING of the fourth day he was squatting on a hill . watching the sun come up over what he knew at last to he Prince Albert . Cocks crowed ; light blinked on the windowpanes of houses ; a child was driving two donkeys down the long main street . K joined the road that entered the town from the south . He passed the old millwheel ; he passed fenced gardens . A pair of liver-colored dogs galloped up and down inside a fence baying , eager to get at him . A few houses further along the street a young woman was kneeling at an outside tap washing a bowl . She glanced over her shoulder at him : he touched his beret ; she looked away . Now there were shops on both sides of the street : a baker , a cafe , a clothing store , a bank agency , a welding shop , a general dealer , garages . Grids of steel mesh were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K sat down on the stoep with his back to the mesh and closed his eyes against the sun . Now I am here , he thought . Finally . An hour later K was still sitting there , asleep , his mouth agape . Children , whispering and giggling , had gathered around him . One of them delicately lifted the beret from his head , put it on , and twisted his mouth in parody . His friends snorted with laughter . He dropped the beret askew on K 's head and tried to worm the box away from him ; but both hands were folded over it . The shopkeeper arrived with his keys ; the children fell back ; and when he began to remove the griliework K woke . up . The interior of the shop was dim and cluttered . Galvanized-iron bathtubs and bicycle wheels hung from the ceiling alongside fan belts and radiator hoses ; there were bins of nails and pyramids of plastic buckets , shelves of canned goods , patent medicines , sweets , baby wear , cold drinks . K stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Those were the names his mother had remembered from the past . " I 'm looking for a Mr. Vosloo or a Mr. Visser who is a farmer . " " There is no Vosloo or Visser who farms . Visagie ? is that who you mean ? What do you want the Visagies for ? " " I have to take something there . " He held up the box . " Then you have come a long way for nothing . There is no one at the Visagies ' place , it has been empty for years . Are you sure the name you want is Visagie ? The Visagies left long ago . " K , asked for a packet of ginger snaps . " Who sent you here ? " asked the shopkeeper . K looked stupid . " They should have got someone who knows what he is doing . Tell them that when you see them . " K mumbled and left . He was walking up the street , wondering where to try next , when one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you where Visagies ' is ! " he called . K stopped . " But it 's empty , there 's no one there , " the child said . He gave directions that would take K north along the road to Kruidfontein and then east by a farm road along the valley of the Moordenaarsrivier . " How far is the farm from the big road ? " asked K. " A long way or a short way ? " The boy was vague , and his companions did not know . " You turn off at the sign of the finger pointing , " he said . K gave them money for sweets . It was noon before he reached the pointing finger and turned off onto a track that led into desolate gray flats ; the sun was going down when he climbed a crest and came in sight of a low whitewashed farmhouse beyond which the land rose from rippling flats to foothills and then to the steep dark slopes of the mountains themselves . He approached the house and circled it . The shutters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole where one of the gables had crumbled , leaving timbers exposed and galvanized roof plates buckled . A Ioose plate flapped monotonously in the wind . Behind the house was a rockery garden in which nothing was growing . There was no old wagonhouse such as he had imagined , but a wood-and-iron shed , and against it an empty chicken run with streamers of yellow plastic blowing in the netting .. wire . On the rise behind the house stood a pump whose head was missing . Far out in the veld the vanes of a second pump glinted . Front and back doors were locked . He yanked at a shutter and the restraining hook came loose . Cupping his eyes , he peered through the window but could make out nothing . As he entered the shed a pair of startled swallows flew out . A harrow covered in dust and cobwebs occupied most of the floor . Barely able to see in the gloom , breathing an odor of paraffin and wool and tar , he scratched along the walls among picks and spades , odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empty bottles , till he came upon a pile of empty feed sacks , which he dragged into the open , shook clean , and laid out as a bed for himself on the stoep . He ate the last of the biscuits he had bought . He still had half of his money left but no more use for it . The light faded . There was a flutter of bats under the eaves . He lay on his bed listening to the noises on the night air , air denser than the air of day . Now I am here , he thought . Or at least I am somewhere . He went to sleep . K explored the single-roomed cottages on the hillside behind the farmhouse . They were built of brick and mortar , with cement floors and iron roofs . It was not possible that they were half a century old . But a few yards away a little rectangle of weathered raudbrick stood out from the bare earth . Was this where his mother had been born , amid a garden of prickly pear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set it in the middle of the rectangle , and sat down to wait . He did not know what he expected ; whatever it was , it did not happen . A beetle scurried across the ground . The wind blew . There was a cardboard box standing in the sunlight on a patch of baked mud , nothing more . He followed the perimeter fence all the way around the farm without meeting any living sign of neighbors . In a trough covered with a sheet of iron he found moldering sheep feed ; he picked out a handful of mealies and put them in his pocket . He returned to the pump and fiddled with it till he discovered how the brake mechanism worked . He rejoined the broken cable and stopped the crazy dry spinning of the wheel . Though he continued to sleep in the house he was not at ease there . Roaming from one empty room to another he felt as insubstantial as air . He sang47 to himself and heard his voice echo from walls and ceiling . He shifted his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars through the hole in the roof . His days he spent at the dam . One morning he took off all his clothes and washed them , standing chest-deep in the water and pounding them against the wall ; for the rest of the day , while the clothes dried , he dozed in the shade of a tree . The time came to return his mother to the earth . He tried to dig a hole on the crest of the hill west of the dam , but an inch from the surface the spade met solid rock . So he moved to the edge of what had been cultivated land below the dam and dug a hole as deep as his elbow . He laid the packet of ash in the hole and dropped the first spadeful of earth on top of it . Then he had misgivings . He closed his eyes and concentrated , hoping that a voice would speak reassuring him that what he was doing was right  --  his mother 's voice , if she still had a voice , or a voice belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice as it sometimes spoke telling him what to do . But no voice came . So lie extracted the packet from the hole , taking the responsibility on himself , and set about clearing a patch a few meters square in the middle of the field . There , bending low so that they would not be carried away by the wind , he distributed the fine gray flakes over the earth , afterward turning the earth over spadeful by spadeful . This was the beginning of his life as a cultivator . On a shelf in the shed he had found a packet of pumpkin seeds , some of which he had already idly roasted and eaten ; he still had the mealie kernels ; and on the pantry floor he had even picked up a solitary bean . In the space of a week he cleared the land near the dam and restored the system of furrows that irrigated it . Then he planted a small patch of pumpkins and a small patch of mealies ; and some distance away on the river batik , where he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bean , so that if it grew it could climb into the thorntrees . For the most part he was living on birds that he killed with his catapult . His days were divided between this form of hunting , which he carried on nearer the farmhouse , and the tilling of the soil . His deepest pleasure came at sunset when he turned open the cock at the dam wall and watched the stream of water run down its channels to soak the earth , turning it from fawn to deep brown . The borehole , pumped dry , yielded only a weak and intermittent stream . It became K 's deepest wish for the flow of water from the earth to be restored . He pumped only as much as his garden needed , allowing the level in the dam to drop to a few inches and watching without emotion as the marsh dried up , the mud caked , the grass withered , the frogs turned on their backs and died . He did not know how underground waters replenished themselves but knew it was bad to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , in 48 a pocket outside time . Cape Town and the war and his passage to the farm slipped further and further into forgetfulness . HEN ONE DAY , returning to the house at noontime , he saw the front door wide open ; and while he still stood confounded , a figure emerged from the interior into the sunlight , a pale plump young man in khaki uniform . " Do you work here ? " were this stranger 's first words . He stood at the head of the steps as if he owned the house . There was nothing for K to do but nod . " I have never seen you before , " said the stranger . " Are you looking after the farm ? " K nodded . " When did the kitchen fall in like that ? " he asked . Trying to bring out words , K stumbled . The stranger did not shift his gaze from K 's had mouth . Then he spoke again . " You do n't know who I am , do you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " K removed his sacks from the kitchen to one of the rooms on the hillside and yielded the house to the new Visagie . He felt the uld hopeless stupidity invading him , which he tried to beat back . Perhaps he will stay only a day or two , he thought , when he sees that there is nothing good enough for him here ; perhaps he will be the one to go and I will be the one to stay . But the grandson , it emerged , was not able to go . That same evening , when K had made a fire up on the hillside and was broiling a pair of bush doves for his supper , the grandson appeared out of the dusk and hung around so long that K felt obliged to offer him a share . He ate like a hungry boy . There was not enough for both of them . Then his story came out . " When you go to Prince Albert , I want you to take care not to mention it to anyone that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out , a deserter from the army . He had slipped off a troop train at Kruidfontein siding the previous evening and walked across country all night , arriving at last at the farm he remembered from his schoolboy days . " Our family used to spend every Christmas . here , " he said . " Family would keep coming till the house was bursting at the seams . I 've never seen such eating as we used to do . Day after day my grandmother would pile the table with food , good country food , and we would eat every last scrap . Karoo lamb like you never taste anymore . " Meanwhile . the more the grandson talked , the more vehement he became . He was anemic , he said , he had a weak heart , it was in his papers , no one contested it , yet here they were sending him to the front . They were reassigning clerks and sending them to the front . Did they think they could do without clerks ? Did they think they could run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for him , the regular police or the military police , to take him back and make an example of him , K mustplay dumb . He must play the idiot and reveal nothing . Meanwhile he , the grandson , would make a hiding place for himself . He knew the farm , he would find a place where they would never dream of looking . It would be better if K did not know the hiding place . Could K find him a saw ? He needed a saw , he wanted to begin work first thing in the morning . K agreed to look . Then followed a long silence . " Is this all you eat ? " asked the grandson . K nodded . " You should plant potatoes , " said the grandson . " Potatoes , onions , mealies  --  anything will grow here if you give it enough water . This is good soil . I 'm surprised you do n't grow a few things for yourself down the dam . " A pang of disappointment cut through K : even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find you , " the grandson went on . " People have a hard time finding good farm servants nowadays . What is your name ? " " Michael , " answered K. It was dark now . The grandson stood up uncertainly . " You have n't got a flashlight ? " he asked . " No , " said K ; and watched him pick his way down the hillside in the moonlight . Morning came and there was no longer anything for him to do . He could not go to the dam without betraying his garden . He sat on his heels against the wall of the room , feeling the sun warm his body , feeling time pass , till the grandson came climbing the hill again . He is ten years younger than me , K thought . The climb brought a flush to his skin . " Michael , there is nothing to eat ! " the grandson complained . " Do n't you ever go to the shop ? " Without waiting for a reply he pushed open the door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comment , but then stopped himself . " How much do they pay you , Michael ? " he said . He thinks I am truly an idiot , thought K. He thinks I am an idiot who sleeps on the floor like an animal and lives on birds and lizards and does not know there is such a thing as money . He looks at the badge on my beret and asks himself what child gave it to me out of what lucky packet . " Two rand , " said K. " Two rand a week . " " Where do you come from ? You arc not from here , are you ? " " I have been all over , " said K. " I have been in the Cape too . " " Are n't there sheep on the farm ? " said the grandson . " Are n't there goats ? Did n't I see goats yesterday , ten or twelve goats out beyond the dam ? " " They come to the dam at night , " said K. " During the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought : A soldier without a gun . A boy on an adventure . To him the farm is just a place of adventure . He said : " Leave the goats , I 'll get you something to eat . " So while the sound of sawing came from the house , K took his catapult and walked down to the river and in an hour had killed three sparrows and a dove . He brought the dead birds to the front door and knocked . The grandson , stripped to the waist and sweating , came to meet him . " Very good , " he said . " Can you clean them quickly ? I would appreciate that . " K held up the four dead birds , their feet together in a tangle of claws . There was a pearl of blood at the beak of one of the sparrows . " So small you do n't taste it as it goes down , " he said . " You would n't get yourself dirty , not even your little finger . " " What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What the fuck do you mean ? If you want to say something , say it ! Put those things down , I 'll take care of them ! " So K laid the four birds down on the stoep at the front door and departed . HE FIRST stubby pumpkin leaves were pushing through the earth , one here , one there . K opened the sluice for the last time and watched the water wash slowly across the field , turning the earth dark . Now when I am most needed , he thought , I abandon my children . He closed the sluice and bent the stem of the ball down till the cock was jammed shut , cutting the flow to the trough from which the goats drank . He brought four jars of water back and set them on the steps . The grandson , wearing his shirt again , stood with his hands in his pockets staring into the distance . After a long silence he spoke . " Michael , " he said , " I 'm not the one who pays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like that . But we have to work together , otherwise ? " He turned his gaze on K. " I want you to go to Prince Albert for me , Michael , " said the grandson . " I will give you a fist of things I want , and money . I will give you something for yourself too . Just do n't talk to anyone . Do n't say you have seen rne , do n't say who you are getting the things for . Do n't say you are getting them for anyone . Do n't get everything at the same shop . Get half at Van Rhyn 's and half at the caf ? . Do n't stop and talk  --  pretend you are in a hurry . Do you understand ? " Let me not lose my way , K thought . He nodded . The grandson went on . " Michael , I am speaking to you as one human being to another . There is a war on , there are people dying . Well , I am at war with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ? I make my peace with everyone . There is no war here on the farm . You and I can live here quietly till they make peace everywhere . No one will disturb us . Peace has got to come one of these days . " Michael , I worked in the paymaster 's office . I know what is going on . I know how many men are going eleven-sixty-three every month , whereabouts unknown , pay stopped , docket opened . Do you know what I mean ? I could give you figures that would shock you . I 'm not the only one . Soon they are not going to have enough men , I 'm telling you , they are49 not going to have enough men to track down the men who are running away ! This is a big country ! Just look around you ! Lots of places to go ! Lots of places to hide ! " I just want to keep out of sight for a little while . They will soon give up . I 'm just a little fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michael . You must help me . Otherwise there is no future for either of us . Do you see ? " So K left the farm carrying the list of things the grandson needed and forty rand in notes . He picked up an old tin by the roadside , and at the gate of the farm buried the money in the tin under a stone . Then he cut across country , keeping the sun on his left and avoiding all habitation . In the afternoon he began to climb , till the neat white houses of the town of Prince Albert emerged below him to the west . Keeping to the slopes , he skirted the town and joined the road that led up into the Swartberg . He tramped uphill in dark shadow , wearing his mother 's coat against the chill , E WALKED all night after his escape from Jakkalsdrif work camp , feeling no fatigue , trembling sometimes with the thrill of being free . When it began to grow light he left the road and moved across open country . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled by buck leaping from cover and racing away into the hills . The dry white grass waved in the wind , the sky was blue , his body was overflowing with vigor . Walking in great loops , he skirted first one farmhouse , then another . The landscape was so empty that it was not hard to believe at times that his was the first foot ever to tread a particular inch of earth or disturb a particular pebble . But every mile or two there was a fence to remind him that he was a trespasser as well as a runaway . Ducking through the fences , he could feel a craftsman 's pleasure in wire spanned so taut that it hummed when it was plucked . He climbed the last rise , his heart beating faster . As he reached the crest the house came into sight below , first the roof and the broken gable , then the whitewashed walls , everything as it had been before . Surely , he thought , surely now I have outlasted the last of the Visagies ; surely every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being devoured by time in Jakkalsdrif was as long a day for that boy to endure , eating or starving , sleeping or waking in his hiding hole . The back door was unlocked . As K pushed open the top flap something leapt out nearly into his face and raced away around a corner : a cat , a huge cat with mottled black and ginger fur . He had never seen a cat on the farm before . The house smelled of heat and dust , but also of 50 old fat and uncured leather . The kitchen , into which a beam of sunlight shone from the hole in the roof , was empty ; the smell came from the pantry , where , peering into shadow , K made out a side of sheep or goat hanging from a hook . Though there was little left of the carcass but bones held together by a dry gray parchment , green-bellied flies still buzzed about it . He left the kitchen and went through the rest of the house seeking in the gloom for signs of the Visagie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . The floors were covered in a fresh film of dust . The attic door was padlocked on the outside . Furniture stood where it had always stood , there were no telltale marks . He stood in the middle of the dining room and held his breath listening for the faintest stirring from above or below ; but the very heart of the grandson , if there were a grandson and he were alive , beat in time with his own . He emerged into sunlight and took the track across the veld to the dam and the field where once he had scattered his mother 's ashes . Every stone , every bush along the way he recognized . He felt at home at the dam as he had never felt in the house . The dam itself was dry , the once lush grass around it brittle , white , dead . There was no trace of the pumpkins and mealies he had sown . Veld grasses had taken over the patch he had dug and were growing briskly . He released the brake of the pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn . The piston plunged and came up . Water gushed , in rust-brown gouts at first , then clear . All was as it had been before , as he had remembered it in the mountains . He held his hand in the flow and felt the force beat his finger back ; he climbed into the dam and stood under the stream , turning his face up like a flower , drinking and being bathed ; he could not get enough of the water . He slept in the open , and awoke from a dream in which the Visagie boy , crouched in a ball in the dark beneath the floorboards , with spiders walking over him and the great weight of the wardrobe pressing down above his head , mouthed words , pleas or cries or orders , he did not know , that he could not hear or understand . He sat up feeling stiff and exhausted . Let him not steal my first day from me ! he groaned to himself . All morning he tramped the veld , searching along the shallow gullies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock broke in sheer lines . Three hundred yards from the dam two low hills , like plump breasts , curved toward each other . Where they met their sides formed a sloping crevice as deep as a man 's waist three or four yards long . The bed of the crevice was of a fine dark blue gravel ; the same gravel could be chipped from the sides . This was the site K settled on . From the shed beside the farmhouse he fetched his tools , a spade and chisel . From the roof of a sheep pen he removed a His retreat was little more than a mile from the track that passed through the farm and then looped back to rejoin the secondary road leading into the farther reaches of the Moordenaarsvallei . Little frequented though the track was , there was still reason to be wary . Several times , hearing the far-off drone of a motor , K had to duck and hide . Once or twice he came across hoofprints of buck in the damp soil , but gave no thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a clatter of hooves . He crawled out of his house , smelling them before he saw them : the goats he had thought lied forever when the dam dried up . Stumbling after them , shouting abuse , throwing stones , fuddled with sleep but driven by a desire to save his garden , he fell and drove a thorn deep into his palm . All night he patrolled the acre . The goats emerged in the early morning light , dotting the hillsides in twos and threes , waiting for him to go ; and all day he had to remain on guard , making sorties after them with stones . It was these wild goats , which not only threatened his crop but by their presence rendered the acre conspicuous , that decided him : henceforth he would rest by day and stay up at night to protect his land and till it . At first he could work only on moonlit nights : in the dense blackness when there was no moon he would stand rooted , stretching out his hands , fearful of the looming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began to acquire the confidence of a blind man : with a switch held before him he would make his way along the track he had worn between his house and the field , release the brake on the pump , open the cock , fill his can , and carry water to one vine after another , folding the grass aside to find them . Gradually he lost all fear of the night . Indeed , waking sometimes in the daytime and peering outdoors , he would wince at the sharpness of the light and withdraw to his bed with a strange green glow behind his eyelids . U T HAD grown to be late summer , and over a month since he had left the camp at Jakkalsdrif . He had not searched for the Visagie boy , nor did it seem he would ever do so . He tried not to think of him , but sometimes found himself wondering whether the boy might not have dug a hole for himself in the veld , and somewhere else on the farm be living a life parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the army to forget him . It seemed unlikely . In the month since his return there had been no visitor K knew of . The only fresh footprints in the dust on the farmhouse floor were his own and those of the cat , which came and went as it pleased , he did not know how . Then , passing the house one day on a dawn walk , he was thunderstruck to see the front door , which was always closed , standing ajar . He halted not thirty paces from the open eye of the51 door feeling suddenly as naked as a mole in daylight . On tiptoe he retreated to the cover of the riverbed , then stole back to his burrow . For a week he did not go near the farmhouse but crept about in the dark tending his acre , fearful that the merest clatter of pebble against pebble would echo across the veld and give him away . The young pumpkin leaves now seemed nothing so much as vivid green flags proclaiming his occupation of the dam : he spread grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . He could not sleep but lay on his bed of grass beneath the oven-heat of the roof straining his ears for the noises that would herald his discovery . Yet there were times when his fears seemed absurd , spells of clarity in which he would recognize that , cut off from human society , he was in danger of becoming more timorous than a mouse . What grounds had he for thinking that the open door meant the return of the Visagies or the arrival of the police come to consign him to the notorious Brandvlei prison camp ? In a vast country across whose face hundreds of thousands of people were daily following their cockroach pilgrimages in flight from the war , why should he be alarmed if some refugee or other hid away in an empty farmhouse in a desolate strip of country ? The days passed and nothing happened . The sun shone , the birds skipped from bush to bush , the great silence reverberated from horizon to horizon , and K 's confidence came hack . He spent a whole day lying under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its arc from left to right and the shadows moved across the stoep from right to left . Was the strip of deeper darkness in the center an open doorway or the door itself ? It was too far to see . When night came and the moon rose , he approached as far as the dead orchard . There was no light in the house , no sound . He tiptoed into the open , across the yard , to the very foot of the steps , from where he could finally see that the door was open , as it must have been all the time . He climbed the steps and entered the house . In the pitch darkness of the hallway he stood listening , All was silence . He spent the rest of the night lying on a sack in the shed , waiting . He even slept , though he was not used to sleeping by night . In the morning he reentered the house . The floor had been freshly swept , as had the grate . A faint smell of smoke still hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed he found six shiny new unlabeled corned-beef cans . He went to his burrow and spent the day in hiding , shaken by the certainty that soldiers had been on the farm and that they had come on foot . He did not pump water that night , hoping the sun and wind would dry out the floor of the dam . He pulled out more grass , armfuls of grass , and spread it over the telltale pumpkin vines . He lay low and breathed quietly . 52 DAY passed , and another day . Then , as the sun was going down and K had emerged from his house to stretch his limbs , shapes moving across the flats caught his eye . He dropped to the earth . He had seen a man on horseback heading toward the dam , and another man on foot beside him ; he had also clearly seen the barrel of the gun poking over the horseman 's shoulder . Like a worm he began to slither toward his hole , thinking only : Let darkness fall soon , let the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell of the hillock near the mouth of the hole he raised his head for a last look . It was not a horse but a donkey , a donkey so tiny that its rider 's feet almost touched the ground . Further back there was a second donkey , riderless but with two bulky gray packs strapped to its sides ; and between the two donkeys he counted eight men , with a ninth at the tail of the train . All of them had guns ; some seemed to carry packs as well . One wore blue trousers , another yellow , but otherwise they were in camouflage uniform . As quietly as he could K slid backward into the hole . From the doorway he could no longer see anything of them , but on the windless air he heard them dismount at the dam , heard the rattle of the chain as they released the brake on the pump . even heard a murmur of words . Someone climbed the ladder to the platform high above the ground . It grew darker , till it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers were . K heard the thud of an ax down in the riverbed ; later the contour of the ridge above him began to he visible against the faint orange glow of their fire . There was a puff of wind ; the rudder swung , metal groaned , the wheel of the pump turned once and stopped . " Why no water ? " ? he heard the words clearly . There were more words he could not make out , followed by a burst of laughter . Then the wind stirred again , the pump groaned and turned , and through the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet K heard the first boom of the piston deep in the earth . There was a muted cheer . On the wind came the smell of roasting meat . K closed his eyes and rested his face on his hands . It was clear to him now that it was not soldiers who were camping at the dam , who had earlier camped in the house , but men from the mountains , men who blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove off stock and cut one town off from another . whom the radio reported exterminated in scores and the newspapers published pictures of sprawling gape-mouthed in pools of their own blood . That was who his visitors were . Yet they seemed to him like nothing so much as a football team : eleven young men come off the field after a hard game , tired , happy , hungry . His heart was pounding . When they leave in the morning , he thought to himself , I could come out of hiding and trot along behind them like a childfollowing a brass band . After a while they would notice me and stop to ask what I wanted . And I could say : Give me a pack to carry ; let me chop wood and build the fire at the end of the day . Or I could say : Be sure to come back to the dam next time , and I will feed you . He lay awake much of the night listening to the dam slowly fill , peering out occasionally into the starlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browsing on his pumpkins . Then he must have dozed , for the next thing he knew someone was stamping heavily through the grass below him , clapping his hands , chasing the donkeys , and the mountains were already outlined blue on pink against the sky . The wind was still , on the air came faint sounds : the tinkle of a buckle , the clash of a spoon on a mug , the splash of water . Now , he thought , waking fully , now is my last chance : now . He slid out of the burrow into the open , crept forward on hands and knees , and peered over the shoulder of the ridge . There was a man clambering out of the dam . Out of the cold night-water he came , lifted himself onto the wall , and stood there drying himself with a white towel , the first soft light of day shining from his wet naked body . Two men were loading a donkey , one holding the bridle , the other settling and strapping two bulky canvas bags over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in canvas . The rest of the party were behind the dam wall ; sometimes K saw a head move . The man who had stood on the wall reappeared , dressed now . He bent down and opened the cock . Water gushed out along the old furrows K had dug during his first stay , flowing into the field . That is a mistake , thought K , that is a sign . The same man fastened the brake on the pump . In a long straggling line they began moving out eastward across the veld heading for the mountains , one donkey at the head of the line , the other at the tail , the sun , now over the rim of the world , catching them full in the face . K watched from behind the ridge till they were nothing but bobbing specks against the yellow of the grass , thinking : It is not too late to run after them , it is not too late yet . Then when they were finally gone he came out and made a tour of the flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their marks were everywhere . They had not mil : cropped the vines but in many places trampled them There were long severed creepers winding throng ) the grass whose leaves were already furling an drooping ; the few kernels that had shot , little gree nuts no bigger than marbles , were devoured . He ha lost half his crop . Otherwise the strangers had le behind no trace of their passing . Over the site the fire they had spread soil and pebbles so pain takingly that it was only by its warmth that he cou detect the spot . The dam had long emptied itse : he closed the cock . He climbed the hillside above his burrow and , lying on the crest , peered into the sun . ' there was nothing to he seen . They had merged into the hills . He crept into the burrow , stretched out listlessly , and closed his eyes . He was woken later m the morning by the clatter of a helicopter . It passed overhead , following the course of the river . Fifteen minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will see that the land has been flooded , he thought . They will see that the grass is greener . They will see the green of the pumpkins . The leaves are like flags waving to them . They can see everything from the air , everything that by its nature does not hide underground . l should be growing onions . There is still time to run away to the mountains , he thought . even if all I do is hide in a cave . But the listlessness would not leave him . Let them come , be thought , what does it matter . He went back to sleep . HE DONKEYS did not come back , nor did the eleven men , nor did the helicopter . The pumpkins grew . In the night K would creep about stroking the smooth shells . Every night they were palpably larger . As time passed he permitted the hope to grow up again in his breast that all would be well . He woke during the day and peered out over the acre ; from under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at him . Then came the evening when the first pumpkin was ripe enough to cut . It had grown earlier and faster than the others , in the very center of the field ; K had marked it out as the first fruit , the firstborn . The shell was soft , the knife sank in without a struggle . The flesh , though still rimmed with green , was a deep orange . On the wire grid he had made he laid strips of pumpkin over a bed of coals that glowed brighter and brighter as the dark came on . The fragrance of the burning flesh rose into the sky . Speaking the words he had been taught . directing them no longer upward but to the earth on which he knelt , he prayed : " For what we are about to receive make us truly thankful . " With two wire skewers he turned the strips , and in midact felt his heart suddenly flow over with thankfulness . It was exactly as they had described it , like a gush of warm water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that remains is to live here quietly for the rest of my life , eating the food that my own labor has made the earth to yield . All that remains is to be a tender of the soil . He lifted the first strip to his mouth . Beneath the crisply charred skin the flesh was soft and juicy . He chewed with tears of joy in his eyes . The best , he thought , the very best pumpkin I have tasted . For the first time since he had arrived in the 0 country he found pleasure in eating . The aftertaste U 54 of the first slice left his mouth aching with sensual delight . He moved the grid off the coals and took a second slice . His teeth bit through the crust into the soft hot pulp . Such pumpkin , he thought , such pumpkin I could eat every day of my life and never want anything else . And what perfection it would be with a pinch of salt  --  with a pinch of salt , and a dab of butter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered over the top ! Eating the third slice , and the fourth and fifth , till half the pumpkin was gone and his belly was full , K wallowed in the recollection of the flavor of salt , butter , sugar , cinnamon , one by one . But the ripening of the pumpkins brought a new anxiety . For while it had been possible to conceal the vines , the pumpkins themselves created hollows which even at a distance gave the field an odd look , as though a flock of lambs were sleeping in the knee-high grass . K did what he could to fold the grass back over the pumpkins but dared not cover them wholly , for it was the precious late-summer sun that was ripening them . The days were growing shorter , the nights colder . Sometimes K had to wear his black coat to work in the field ; he slept with his feet wrapped in a bag and his hands between his thighs . He slept more and more . He no longer sat outside when his tasks were finished , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked about in the veld , but crept into his hole and fell into deep sleep . All morning he would sleep . At noon he would begin to emerge into an interval of languor and waking dreams , bathed in a gentle warmth that radiated down from the roof ; then as the sun set he would come out , stretch himself , and go down to the riverbed to chop wood till he could no longer see his mark . The pumpkins were ripening all together , the vines turning yellow and withering . K had not thought of how he could store them . He tried cutting the flesh in strips and drying it in the sun , but it rotted and attracted ants . He piled the thirty pumpkins in a pyramid near his burrow ; it looked like a beacon . They could not he buried , they needed warmth and dryness , they were creatures of the sun . Eventually he deposited them fifty paces apart up and down the riverbed in the undergrowth ; to disguise them he made a paste of mud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day passed when K did not come out of his burrow at all . He awoke in the afternoon feeling no hunger . There was a cold wind blowing , there was nothing that needed his attention , his work for the year was done . He turned over and went to sleep again . When next he knew , it was dawn and birds were singing . He lost track of time . Sometimes , waking stifled under the black coat with his legs swaddled in the bag , he knew that it was day . There were long periods when lie lay in a gray stupor too tired to kick himself free of sleep . He could feel the processes HARPERS/SEPTEMBER 1983 Iakkalsdrif , " I live in the veld , " he said , replying to their question ; " I live nowhere . " Then he had to rest his head on his knees : there was a hammering inside his skull and a taste of bile in his mouth . One of the soldiers picked up an arm between two fingers and dangled it . K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien , a stick protruding from his body . " What do you think he lives on ? " the soldier asked ? " Flies ? ants ? locusts ? " K could see nothing but their boots . He closed his eyes ; for a while he was absent . Then someone gave his shoulder a slap and pushed something at him : a sandwich , two thick slices of white bread with polony between them . He pulled back and shook his head . " Eat , man ! " his benefactor said . " Get some strength into yourself ! " He took the sandwich and bit into it , Before he could chew his stomach began to retch dryly . With his head between his knees he spat out the mouthful of bread and meat and handed the sandwich back . " He 's sick , " said one voice . " He 's been drinking , " said another . But then they found his house , the stonework of the front wall nakedly visible after the rain . First they took turns on hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof and uncovered the neat interior , the spade and ax , the knife and spoon and plate and mug on a shelf cut into the gravel , the bed of wet grass . They brought K over to confront his handiwork , holding him upright , no longer disposed to be kindly . Tears ran down his face . " Did you make this ? " they asked . He nodded . " Are you alone here ? " He nodded . The soldier holding him brought his arm up sharply behind his back . K hissed with pain . " The truth ! " said the soldier . " It is the truth , " said K. The truck arrived too ; the air was loud with voices and the squawks and rasps of the two-way radio ; soldiers were crowding around to see K and the house he had built . " Spread out ! " one of them shouted : " I want the whole area searched ! We are looking for footpaths , we are looking for holes and tunnels , we are looking for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was dressed in camouflage uniform like everyone else ; there was no badge K could see to tell he was in charge . " You see what kind of people they are . " he said . His eyes moved around restlessly , he did not seem to be speaking to anyone in particular . " You think there is nothing and all the time the ground beneath your feet is rotten with tunnels . Look around a place like this and you would swear there was n't a living soul in miles . Then turn your back and they come crawling out of the ground . Ask him how long he 's been here . " He turned on K and raised his voice . " You ! How long have you been here ? " " Since last year , " K said , not knowing whether it was a good lie or a bad lie . " So when are your friends coming ? When are your friends coming again ? " K shrugged.55 " Ask him again , " said the officer , turning away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are coming . Ask him when they were last here . See if he 's got a tongue . See if he is such an idiot as he looks . " The soldier who was holding K gripped the nape of his neck between thumb and forefinger and guided him down till he was kneeling , till his face was touching the earth . " You heard what the officer said , " he said , " so tell me . Tell me your story . " He flicked the beret away and pressed K 's face hard into the earth . With nose and lips squashed flat , K tasted the damp soil . He sighed . They lifted him and held him up . He did not open his eyes . " So tell us about your friends , " the soldier said . K shook his head . He was hit a terrific blow in the pit of the stomach and fainted . They spent the afternoon hunting for the stocks of food and arms they were convinced were hidden there . First they scoured the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the river . There was an instrument with earphones and a black box that one of them used : K watched him move slowly along the shoulder of the riverbank , where the earth was soft , prodding his rod into the earth . Many of the pumpkins , perhaps all of them , were discovered : young men kept returning bearing pumpkins , which they tossed in a heap at the edge of the field . The pumpkins only made them more certain that there were stores hidden ( " Otherwise why would they leave this monkey here ? " K overheard ) . They quartered themselves in the farmhouse . In the kitchen they set up their own stove ; soon K could smell tomatoes cooking . Someone had hung a radio on a hook on the stoep ; the air was full of nervous electric rhythms that unsettled him . They put him in the bedroom at the end of the corridor , on a tarpaulin folded in four , with a blanket over him . They gave him warm milk and two pills that they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dark , a boy brought him a plate of food . " See if you can eat just a mouthful , " he said . He shone a flashlight on the plate . K saw two sausages in a thick gravy , and mashed potato . He shook his head and turned to the wall . The boy left the plate at the bedside ( " In case you change your mind " ) . After that they did not disturb him . He drowsed uneasily for a while , troubled by the smell of the food . At last he got up and put the plate in a corner . Some of the soldiers were on the stoep , some in the living room . There was talk and laughter but no light . HE NEXT morning the police arrived from Prince Albert with dogs to help in the search for tunnels and hidden supplies . Captain Oosthuizen recognized K at once . " How could I forget a face like that ? " he said . " This joker ran away from Jakkalsdrif in December . His name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Michael , " said the army officer . " It 's Michaels , " said Captain Oosthuizen . He poked K in the ribs with his boot . " He 's not sick , he always looks like this . Hey , Michaels ? " So they took K back to the dam , where he watched the dogs drag their handlers back and forth across the acre of grass and up and down the riverbanks , whining with eagerness , tugging at the leash , but finally able to lead them to nothing better than old porcupine burrows and hare sets . Oosthuizen gave K a cuff on the side of the head . " So what 's this about , monkey ? " lie said . " You playing games with us ? " The dogs were loaded back into the van . Everyone was losing interest in the search . The young soldiers stood about in the sun talking , drinking coffee . K sat with his head between his knees . Though his mind was clear , he could not control the dizziness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not bother to stop it . Every grain of this earth will be washed clean by the rain , he told himself , and dried by the sun and scoured by the wind , before the seasons turn again . There will be not a grain left bearing my marks , just as my mother has now , after her season in the earth , been washed clean , blown about , and drawn up into leaves of grass . There was a heavy explosion , and at once a second explosion . The air shook , there was a clamor of birds , the hills rumbled and echoed . K stared around wildly . " Look ! " said a soldier , and pointed . Where the Visagie house had once stood there was now a cloud of gray and orange , not mist but dust , as if a whirlwind were carrying the house away . Then the cloud stopped growing , its substance thinned , and a skeleton began to emerge ! part of the back wall with the chimney ; three of the supports that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the air and hit the ground noiselessly . The reverberations went on , but K did not know any more if they were in the hills or in his head . Swallows flew past , so low above the ground he could have touched them had he stretched out a hand . Afterward there were more explosions , for which he did not look up , guessing that the outbuildings had gone . He thought : No longer do the Visagies have anywhere to hide . The jeep came bumping back across the veld . All around him they were clearing and packing up . In the acre itself , however , a lone soldier was still at work . He was digging up tufts of grass and laying them carefully to one side . With some anxiety K rose to his feet and stumbled across . " What are you doing ? " he called . The soldier did not answer . He began to shape a shallow pit , laying the earth on a black plastic sheet . This was the third hole he had dug , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earth on plastic sheets beside them , and tufts ofgrass with the earth still clinging to their roots . " What are you doing ? " he asked again . The sight of the stranger digging up his earth agitated him more than he would have guessed . " Let me do it , " he offered ? " I am used to digging . " But the soldier waved him away . Completing the third hole , he stepped off eight paces and laid down another plastic sheet . As the spade bit into the earth , K squatted and covered the grass with his hands . " Please , my friend ! " he said . The soldier stood back , exasperaced . Someone hauled K back by the scruff of his neck . " Just keep him out of my way , " said the soldier . K stood by the pump and watched . When he had dug five holes in a zigzag pattern , the soldier unrolled a long white cord to mark off the area . Two of his comrades brought a crate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they laid each and primed it , the first soldier planted the grass and poured the earth back handful by handful , patted the surface down , and brushed away all their prints with a hand broom , moving backward on hands and knees . " Get out of the way here , " said someone behind K. " Go and wait there by the truck . " It was the officer . Retreating , K heard the instructions he was giving : " Tape two inside the struts at about waist height . Put another under the platform . When they trip it , I want the whole thing to go . " Everything was packed in , they were about to drive off , with K in the back of the truck among the soldiers , when someone pointed to the heap of pumpkins they had left by the side of the field . " Load them ! " shouted the officer from the jeep . They loaded the pumpkins . " And fix up that kennel of his so that it looks just the same ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stones to hold it down , like it was ! Hurry up ! " They drove off , humping and jostling on the dirt road , following the jeep . K clutched the strap above his head ; he could feel his neighbors holding their bodies stiff to avoid being thrown against him . A cloud of dust billowed up till he could see nothing of what he was leaving behind . He leaned nearer to the young soldier facing him . " You know , " he said , " there was a boy hiding it that house . " The soldier did not understand . K had to repea himself . " What does he say ? " asked someone . " He says there was another boy hiding in th house . " " Tell him he 's dead now . Tell him he 's in pa adise . " Then after a while they reached the turnoff . T1 truck picked up speed , the tires began to hum , t1 soldiers relaxed , and the dust blew away to rev ( behind them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
