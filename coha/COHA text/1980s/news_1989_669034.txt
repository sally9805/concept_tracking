President Bush on Monday signed legislation providing almost $900 million in aid to farmers who lost crops this year as a result of bad weather . Among the crops hit hardest are winter wheat in the central Plains and cotton and soybeans in the Mississippi Delta . There has been moderate damage to spring grains in the northern Plains . Bush described the estimated $897 million cost of the bill as " reasonable . " It represents a substantial reduction from last year ' s $3. 9 billion agricultural relief package , which President Ronald Reagan described as the most generous in U.S. history . " The farmer is at the mercy of the forces of nature , and sometimes nature fails him , " Bush said at the signing ceremony in the Roosevelt Room of the White House . " The farmer is one of the original American entrepreneurs , " Bush said , " men and women whose phenomenal productivity feeds America and indeed the rest of the world , risk-takers who start from scratch each season , staking their fortunes on the new year ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year it did . " Also attending the signing ceremony were Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter , Sen. Christopher Bond , ( R. , Mo . ) , Kansas Gov . Mike Hayden and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole ( R. , Kan. ) , whom Bush called " a driving force behind this bill . " Bush said the legislation would " provide relief only to those farmers hardest hit by adverse weather , and it wisely rewards those who took the prudent step of purchasing crop insurance . " Under the legislation , farmers who participated in the 1989 price and income support programs for wheat , feed grains , cotton and rice and who purchased federal crop insurance will be paid at 65 percent of the target price for any losses beyond 35 percent of normal production . Those who participated in the 1989 program but chose not to purchase federal crop insurance would be paid at 65 percent of the target price for losses beyond 40 percent of their normal production . Producers of nonprogram crops and producers of program crops who did not participate in the 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of half of their normal production before they receive any payment . Soybean producers must absorb a 45 percent loss before a payment can be made . Last year , these producers had to meet a loss threshold of 35 percent . Unlike the 1988 program , there will be no catastrophic payment rate for 1989 losses above 75 percent . Speaking to reporters outside the White House after the ceremony , Dole said about $400 million of the relief will go to wheat producers in his and other states , since " they had the largest losses . " Bush , who used four pens to sign the legislation as photographers clicked away , noted that , " Kansas was hit especially hard . This year ' s winter wheat crop is less than half of normal levels in a number of states from the Dakotas to the Texas Panhandle and in the mid-Atlantic states as well . Farmers have indeed suffered . . . . " And this act will help farmers recover after damaging rain and wind and will see others through a year when they ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The relief act will require many farmers who receive assistance this year to buy crop insurance in 1990 . Other provisions would provide livestock water and feed assistance and aid to orchard owners with damaged trees . Bush also praised a provision allowing farmers to plant certain alternative crops on farm program base acreage , saying it would assist in a resurgence of U.S. farm exports . The Agriculture Department estimated Thursday that the U.S. wheat crop will be about 2 billion bushels , down almost 17 percent from rough estimates made in March . CAPTION : PHOTO : AP Laserphoto .
