As President Bush returned to Washington from his trip to the Far East this evening , he took personal command of the effort to save the Tower nomination . The shifting grounds for opposition in the Senate and the decision by several swing Democrats to vote against Mr. Tower made prospects for confirmation dim. // Mr. Bush told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One tonight , " I haven ' t wavered one iota " in supporting Mr. Tower " and I don ' t intend to . " <> <> Talk of Acting Secretary // But after the President returned to Washington , Administration sources said he was considering appointing an acting Defense Secretary in the event Mr. Tower loses the Senate vote this week . The plan would be to appoint someone to serve up to 90 days to provide leadership for the Pentagon and to give Mr. Bush time to find a permanent Secretary. // All the senators could not be reached today but it appeared that their opinions were firming along partisan lines. // And if the Democrats stick to their position that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid as a consultant to military contractors after he left the Senate , the nomination is now on " the slippery slope , " a senior White House official acknowledged. // One Democrat the Administration hoped to sway in Mr. Tower ' s favor was Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana . But he said that if the vote were held today he would decide against confirmation . <> <> ' Err on the Side of Safety ' // " I think that if we have a serious doubt , if any senator has a serious doubt about the competence of a candidate , that he should err on the side of safety , " Mr. Breaux said. // But Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina , a Republican whose support for Mr. Tower had been in question , said he would support the nominee " if I don ' t find anything more than I ' ve found so far " in the Federal Bureau of Investigation background report. // Mr. Tower went to the White House this evening to discuss the situation . He met with Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee ; John H. Sununu , the White House chief of staff , and Bob Dole of Kansas , the Senate Republican leader . Upon emerging from the two-hour session , the Senators insisted that they had not given up hope for Mr. Tower ' s nomination . Mr. Dole said that Senate Republicans were working with the Administration to try to put the nomination " back on a bipartisan track , " and Mr. Warner said , " Nobody ' s giving up. " // In another development , a Congressional official said tonight that Representative Larry Combest , a Texas Republican , had approached Senators Nunn and Warner some time ago with damaging information about Mr. Tower ' s drinking . Mr. Combest , who worked for Mr. Tower in the 1970 ' s , stressed that Mr. Tower had stopped drinking heavily , but at the same time he described such excessive drinking in the 1970 ' s that Senator Nunn became disturbed , said the Congressional official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . Congressional sources said this material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nomination. // The Washington Post in its Tuesday issue carried an account of the information provided by Mr. Combest , saying that the degree of drinking that he described had hit Mr. Nunn " like a ton of bricks . " Later , the Congressional sources and the Post account agree , Mr. Combest told his story to the F.B.I. , but in a milder version. and said Mr. Tower had never been unable to perform his duties. // Senate debate on the nomination is scheduled to begin Wednesday , but the precise time for the vote , orginally expected for Thursday , is in doubt . The Senate majority leader , George J. Mitchell of Maine , said today that he had assured senators in both parties that there would be ample time for a full discussion of the nomination and thus could not be certain when a vote would occur . <> <> Several Factors in Division // So far no Democrats have announced in favor of Mr. Tower and only one Republican , Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota , has signaled his plan to defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several factors , including the role of Senator Nunn . The Georgia Democrat heads the Armed Services Committee , which rejected Mr. Tower last week by an 11-to-9 vote that went along party lines. // Conservative Southern Democrats , who might have formed a natural constituency for Mr. Tower , are following the lead of Mr. Nunn . The drinking issue , which has raised particular concerns in the South , has also left Democrats from the region hesitant to support Mr. Tower. // For example , Senator Richard C. Shelby , a conservative Alabama Democrat who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , called Mr. Tower ' s abstinence pledge " a belated effort to win the confidence " of the panel and the full Senate. // Moreover , Mr. Tower is suffering from fractured support on the Republican right . Evangelicals are suspicious of the twice-divorced Texan ' s style of living , and some strongly anti-Soviet Republicans are upset about his lack of support for President Ronald Reagan ' s missile defense plan . With such party stalwarts as Mr. Helms offering support only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man without a committed constituency within his party or among former colleagues on Capitol Hill. // Senator David Durenberger , a Minnesota Republican who had been viewed as wavering , told reporters that he would support Mr. Tower . Asked what had made up his mind , Mr. Durenberger replied , " Because I ' m a good Republican . " <> <> Quayle Would Break Tie // The Administration must hold all 45 Senate Republicans and gain at least five of the Senate ' s 55 Democrats to secure Mr. Tower ' s confirmation , with the knowledge that Mr. Quayle would break the tie. // Mr. Tower ' s extensive contacts in the military industry also became the focus of discussion on Capitol Hill today , with some people accusing Mr. Nunn of adding a new condition to Mr. Tower ' s nomination. // But Mr. Nunn had expressed concern about the issue since the first day of Mr. Tower ' s confirmation hearings , and in casting his vote against the nominee last Thursday , Mr. Nunn said Mr. Tower had crossed an ill-defined line in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflects a fundamental policy judgment as to whether the individual can command the public confidence which is required if he is to lead the effort " to reform Pentagon procurement practices. // The White House appeared to be losing ground among the Democrats . In Miami today , Senator Bob Graham , a Florida Democrat , said he was leaning against Mr. Tower despite the abstinence pledge. // " I think it helps , but it ' s not just the drinking which is a problem to me , " The Associated Press quoted Mr. Graham as saying . " It ' s a pattern of bad judgment in the 1970 ' s , in drinking , bad judgment by placing himself in compromising positions as the U.S. arms negotiator in Geneva in the mid-80 ' s , bad judgment in accepting large sums from the defense industry in the late 1980 ' s. " // Senator Spark M. Matsunaga , a Democrat from Hawaii who had also been targeted by the White House , turned down an invitation to discuss the nomination with Mr. Bush and told White House officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senator said . <> <> Focus on Seven Senators // The Administration ' s efforts to win support for Mr. Tower are focused on seven Democratic senators , including the nominee ' s fellow Texan , Lloyd Bentsen , who are among the uncommitted Democrats scheduled to meet with Mr. Bush at the White House on Tuesday or Wednesday . The six other Democrats are Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina , Howell Heflin of Alabama , Dennis Deconcini of Arizona and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut , J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and Charles S. Robb of Virginia. // Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Dole met privately this morning at Mr. Dole ' s request , but both men would not discuss their session with reporters. // Senator Robb today called Mr. Tower ' s pledge to abstain from drinking " an astute move , " but said he remained undecided and would read the F.B.I. material . The pledge " addresses at least one of the concerns that have been raised publicly , " Mr. Robb said. // The Virginia Democrat said much of what has been reported about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appears to have a factual basis. " // " I regret that we have come to the point where such a pledge appears to be required under the circumstances , " Mr. Robb said Mr. Dodd , who spoke at a press conference in Hartford , attempted to dampen speculation that his decision on Mr. Tower ' s confirmation would be based on a vote Mr. Tower cast in the Senate 22 years ago in support of his father , the late Senator Thomas Dodd . The elder Mr. Dodd was disciplined by the Senate for financial misconduct , and Mr. Tower was one of a handful of senators who voted against the action. // Mr. Dodd said the connection between his father and Mr. Tower was " a very minor factor " in influencing his decision on Mr. Tower ' s confirmation . <> <> Bentsen ' s Role // As Senate Republicans searched today for reasons to appear hopeful about Mr. Tower ' s chances , several pointed to Mr. Bentsen ' s decision as a crucial one that could sway other Democratic votes . " Lloyd Bentsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect people hold for him , his decision will become others ' decision. " said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming , the Republican whip. // Senator Orrin G. Hatch , a Utah Republican , also cited Mr. Bentsen ' s potentially important role in persuading other Democrats to support Mr. Tower , noting that Mr. Bentsen had praised his fellow Texan highly when he appeared with him at the Senate Armed Services Committee several weeks ago as the confirmation process began. // " I have to believe there are people here like Lloyd Bentsen who can be a real voice of reason among the Democrats , " Mr. Hatch said. // Mr. Bentsen said Republicans and the Administration were attempting to test him , a spokesman for the Senator said . Mr. Bentsen has assumed a new and more influential role in the Democratic Party as a result of his 1988 Vice Presidential campaign. // " They served together for 14 years in the Senate and worked well in a bipartisan spirit , especially on issues affecting Texas , " the spokesman said of Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Tower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ //
