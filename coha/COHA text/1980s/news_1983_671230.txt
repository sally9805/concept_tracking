The program , which would not become final until after a 60-day comment period and might be modified , could involve several million customers who have bought General Motors cars produced since 1974. // The agreement would settle a lawsuit brought by the trade commission against the corporation in 1980 that cited premature and excessive wear on the transmission , camshaft and fuel-injection systems of numerous G.M. models. // It is apparently the first time case-by-case arbitration , rather than automatic direct relief , has been proposed in such a dispute . When the agency staff recommended the arbitration plan , F.T.C. attorneys said it reflected the Reagan Administration ' s desire to resolve regulatory matters quickly and noted that the usual approach would require extensive proof and might take years of court action. // Critics , however , say the arbitration plan does not provide adequate relief for affected consumers . Under the proposed agreement , owners of General Motors cars with unresolved complaints about engine and transmission problems could submit their individual claims to the Better Business Bureau for settlement . The bureau ' s decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer , who could take legal action if he was dissatisfied with the outcome of arbitration . The agreement provides for the program to operate nationwide for at least eight years. // In announcing the plan , Carol T. Crawford , director of the commission ' s Bureau of Consumer Protection , said the commission and the company had " furnished consumers a powerful , yet fair and emphatically reasonable , means " for settling disputes through the arbitration process. // Clifford Merriott , a General Motors spokesman in Detroit , said , " The tentative consent order provides a much greater opportunity for immediate , long-lasting and comprehensive consumer benefit than could have been achieved through litigation. " // But a dissenter in the 3-to-2 commission vote , Michael Pertschuk , said in a separate written statement that he did not believe the settlement offered a " strong enough solution for the substantial injury suffered " by owners of the affected Chevrolets , Buicks , Oldsmobiles , Cadillacs and Pontiacs . <> <> No Admission of Wrongdoing // " Only direct , automatic refunds to the consumers , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its cases involving systematic car defects , can do that , " Mr. Pertschuk said. // Although the F.T.C. ' s 1980 lawsuit charged the company with failing to disclose serious engine and transmission problems , General Motors did not acknowledge any wrongdoing or liability by entering into the agreement. // The agreement was criticized as a " sellout " by Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York , who said his office had received nearly 8 , 000 complaints from consumers in New York State . He said his state lawsuit against General Motors would go forward. // Both Mr. Pertschuk and Mr. Abrams attacked the plan for requiring consumers to resolve their problems with the auto maker on a caseby-case basis , despite what they described as the systematic nature of the defects. // Mr. Abrams , for example , argued that locally selected arbitrators would " decide these cases inconsistently because the F.T.C. has failed to establish legally that G.M. ' s design was responsible for the premature failures . " <> <> Arbitration Already in Use // Clarence M. Ditlow 3d , executive director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Ralph Nader and the Consumers Union , said the commission had provided dissatisfied car owners with nothing more than they already had. // He and Mr. Pertschuk noted that General Motors had for five years been offering the services of the Better Business Bureau under an arbitration program that was binding on both the company and the consumer . The organization has handled 32 , 000 cases involving General Motors cars in recent years. // Describing the settlement as " gross consumer abuse , " Mr. Ditlow charged James C. Miller 3d , chairman of the commission , with a conflict of interest . He noted that General Motors had been a client of the consulting firm operated by Mr. Miller before he joined the F.T.C. , and he said the settlement announced today could save the manufacturer more than $1 billion. // Mr. Miller could not be reached for comment . But Merrie Spaeth , a spokesman , said the chairman had acted ethically . He " recused himself from G.M. cases for two years , " she said . " And if he had not voted , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the best thing for General Motors . " <> <> Complaints in 3 Areas // According to the trade commission , complaints about the General Motors cars have focused on three areas : // - The THM 200 transmission , used in five million to six million G.M. cars of all product lines since 1976. // - Premature camshaft wear , potentially affecting 15 million 305-@ and 350-cubic-inch V-8 engines produced by the Chevrolet division and used in several models manufactured since 1974. // - Diesel fuel injection pumps and fuel injectors used in 500 , 000 cars produced by the Oldsmobile division and used in several models since 1977 or 1978. // Commission officials said the agreement would require General Motors to advertise the arbitration program widely and to send information on it to anyone who has complained to the company or to the trade commission. // According to Dean W. Determan , vice president of the mediation/arbitration division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus , the organization expects to handle four million cases brought by unhappy car owners . He said the arbitration process itself would cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of repairing the transmissions and camshafts had averaged $400 to $600 and the cost of repairing the fuel injectors or pumps had ranged from $350 to $500. // Neither the agency nor General Motors would estimate the number of vehicles that might require such repairs , but spokesmen for both said the number of cars with actual problems would be much smaller than the total number of cars produced in the affected years. // This month , a $3. 4 million tentative settlement was approved calling for General Motors to pay car owners who bought 1977 Oldsmobiles that were equipped with Chevrolet engines . Earlier this year , the company announced a recall of 240 , 000 of its 1980 X-model cars to rebuild their braking systems , at a total cost of $30 million. //
