A few choice words usually come to the mind of a driver when he is stopped by the police , but Bavarians have a very expensive reason to think twice before uttering any unseemly thoughts . According to a survey by the Munich newspaper Abendzeitung , Bavarians who vilify traffic officers as damischer Bullen ( stupid bull ) are fined an average of $1,710 . Some less costly imprecations include Raubritter ( robber baron ) at $1,140 , Depp ( idiot ) at $513 and Stinkstiefel ( smelly boot ) , a relative bargain at $51 . <P> Words need not be spoken for an officer 's honor to be impugned . A flip of the middle finger could cost $855 . And if any of Bavaria 's road demons think that being friendly will help them , they should think again . Those found . guilty of addressing police with the familiar Du rather than the more formal Sie are fined an average of $1,283.
