txt It 's fortunate that no one was killed or injured when the ceiling at the north end of the Grant Park underground garage collapsed late Saturday night , dumping tons of concrete and sod on two cars . We ca n't continue to trust to luck that any future accidents will be no more disastrous . Fears about ceiling cave-ins in the underground garages in Grant Park have circulated for several years . But they have usually focused on the newer Monroe Street garage , jua to the east , but not connected to the Grant Park parking area . Now reports belatedly are being made public that should have alerted the Chicago Park District to potential hazards at the 27-year-old Grant Park garage and should have spurred immediate repairs and rehabilitation . ? A study of the Grant Park facility was ordered by the park district more than a year ago because the garage was showing visible signs of deterioration , such as long cracks , falling pieces of concrete , and corrosion of steel reinforcements . Temporary wooden buttresses have been used to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The engineering consulting firm , Wiss , Janney , Elstner &; Associates , expressed the most concern over the section of the garage that extends under Michigan Avenue , where damage has been caused by vibrations from heavy traffic overhead and from road de-icing substances . But the firm 's final report ? presented to the park district capital improvements committee May 4 , when final payment of the $70,000 fee was authorized ? said the facility was basically safe . Obviously , it was incorrect . Monday , at the request of the park district director of parking , the CTA agreed to reduce the speed limit of buses using Michigan Avenue between Randolph and Monroe to 15 miles an hour , in hopes of lessening the hazards of traffic vibrations . Tuesday , the park district asked for bids to begin repair work on the deteriorated section of roof that extends under Michigan Avenue , where at least 30 cracks running the width of the street have been found . But the three-phase repair work is n't scheduled to be completed until 1983 . A 120-square foot section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area still under construction . When Jane Byrne was campaigning for mayor in early 1979 , she charged that the roof of the Monroe Street facility was in imminent danger of collapse and that its hazards were being concealed by the Bilandic administration ; she showed reporters what she said were structural defects in the concrete . The Bilandic administration denied her charges . After her election , Mayor Byrne ordered stress tests made before confirming plans to let hundreds of thousands of people stand on top of the garage area at the outdoor mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II in Grant Park during his visit to Chicago . After the Monroe Street garage roof fell in. no public finding of responsibility was ever made . Architects , contractors , insurance companies . and bonding companies made an out-of-court agreement to settle claims . That should n't happen this time around . The public is entitled to know who is responsible for what went wrong ? and to more convincing assurances it ca n't happen again than we have now . Perhaps until then the entire Grant Park garage should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
