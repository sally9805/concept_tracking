Mismanagement of municipal parking facilities is costing the financially ailing City of Boston more than $2.6 million a year , the Boston FinanceCommission charged yesterday . In a 12-page report sent to the mayor , the Suffolk County district attorney and the Massachusetts attorney general , the commission criticized the city administration for allowing parking leases to lapse at city garages , challenged the decision to close the Government Center Garage and chastized Mayor Kevin H. White for maintaining a 200-space parking lot for the free use of " politically favored city employees . " " In a city that is laying off 200 police and 200 firemen , we have to ask how many of those jobs could have been saved if we had that $2.6 million , " said Edward F. King , chairman of the state-appointed commission that monitors Boston ' s finances . City officials will not comment on the report until they ' ve had an opportunity to study it over the weekend , Joseph Savage , a spokesman for the mayor said yesterday . Of the 29 municipally owned parking facilities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( RPB ) , 13 by the Boston Redevelopment Authority ( BRA ) , two by the Traffic and Parking Department and one by the mayor ' s office . Although all those departments came under fire in the report , the harshest criticism was reserved for the Real Property Board , which , the commission charges , " has cost the city $600,000 in the past year alone because of its neglect in keeping its leases current . " Among other examples cited by the commission was the lease at the St. James Avenue Garage , which expired last April . Locksley Associates , Inc. has continued to operate the 625-car garage on an extension of that lease at an annual rent $740,101 . " Because this lease will solicit bids at $1 million per year or more , the decision to extend the old agreement has cost the city about $250,000 , " the report contends . An even more flagrant instance of " the general slowness of the RPB to manage its affairs properly , " is the shutdown of the Government Center Garage last December , King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted the shutdown , the report said the decision to close the entire 1895-car garage rather than only damaged sections was a costly mistake , aggravated by delays in completing repairs . " The Real Property Board , by failing to write a new lease for the Government Center Garage , by allowing it to fall into a state of disrepair and then neglecting to get it reopened expeditiously , has cost the city over $1 million to date and the cost is increasing daily , " the report charges . The contractor awarded the $118,900 repair job , Alar Company of Charlestown , has been on the site for a month but has not begun work on the structural problems , King said . The parking lot that King characterized as " controlled by Mayor White " is located on Congress street , a short walk from City Hall . " There are two BRA employees assigned to guard the area to make sure that only those with the blessing of the mayor are admitted , " the report contends . " Regardless of which city employees are using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commission estimates that the parking lot , accessible now only to those who have been issued a permit from the mayor ' s office , could generate $500,000 to $600,000 in revenue annually . The commission forwarded its report to Suffolk County Dist . Atty . Newman Flanagan and Atty . Gen. Francis X. Bellotti , King said , because of the Government Center Garage situation and irregularities the commission detected at the city ' s Haywood Place garage . Since 1979 , the Real Property Board has had a lease agreement at Haywood Place that yields the city 60 percent of the gross receipts . " Obviously with such an arrangement , it is important to know how many cars are in the garage every day , " said King , whose staff counted the occupied parking spaces on almost a dozen occassions in February and March . The commission found the garage housed an average of 152 cars , double the number that appears on RPB records for the same days . " The Haywood Place miscounting is something that bears their attention , " King said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found receipts from two metered parking lots under the expressway have decreased in the past two years - from $63,000 in fiscal 1979 to $55,500 in fiscal 1980 to a projected $43,500 in fiscal 1981 . The shrinking income now received from those lots could be increased to more than $600,000 , the commission estimates , if the meters were removed , the lot leased to a management firm and market rates charged to motorists .
