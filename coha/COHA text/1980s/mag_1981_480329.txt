AMERICA HAD BARELY become a country when Alexander Hamilton asked himself : " Am I a fool , a romantic Quixote , or is there a constitutional defect in the American mind ? " There is now . Life in America is like life with the governess in The Turn of the Screw . There are some good days , but sooner or later something happens to set things off and we 're all in the soup again . If suicide notes can be said to possess nationality , surely the most American is the one left by historian Wilbur J. Cash : " I ca n't stand it anymore , and I do n't even know what it is. " 1 do . According to the laws of logic , A is A , a thing can not be other than itself , contradictions can not exist , and parallel lines can not meet . Except in America . The movement of Birnam Wood to Dunsinane is an everyday occurrence in the lumberyard of our national psyche . Contradictions haunt us . After a decade of touchy-feely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a very emotional person , " yet the public stance we admire most , especially in politicians , is " grace under pressure . " Which is right ? The Wasp or the Latin ideal ? The upper-class cool or the lower-class heat ? American status seekers , who used to know exactly what to do , are now stymied . Someone is always getting briefed or debriefed , but no one knows how to behave . The favorite piece of advice for someone in a tense situation is " Do n't try to be a hero " ; then the hostages are sprung and hundreds of editorials announce that at last America has the heroes she has been craving . We are told that it is wicked to stereotype people ; then we are called for jury duty and listen in amazement while the defense eliminates Episcopalians who went to college andthe prosecution eliminates Catholics who went to trade school , until there is nobody left except twelve people who are iiVeapable of understanding the case . That 's the , jury . If , while waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine , we can fmd an article on the joys of fathering back-to-back with a Camel cigarette " Where a Man Belongs " ad showing a loner , his duffel bag beside him , frantically pumping his way out of town on a railroad handcar . He 's smart to get out while he can ; discrimination being prohibited on the grounds of race , color , creed , national origin , sex , sexual orientation , political ideology , and age , smokers have become fair game . The love-it-or-leave-it set will undoubtedly accuse me of being a communist after reading this . For their information , I am more conservative than all of them put together . I am a royalist ; I believe in absolute monarchy and the divine right of kings . I would rather live under a capricious tyrant who says " Off with their heads ! " than be nibblecr-to death by a bureaucratic duck . g , I have thought several times of emigrating , but the only countries in which I would care to live all have strict six-month quarantine laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the more I see of mankind , the more I prefer my dog . " The friendly misanthropes WAS BUYING groceries at Gulpmart , the / Friendly Store , when a woman slithered up to me at the frozen-food bin and whis- pered , " I love you . Pass it on . " She had heard , she explained , about the chain letters of the Thirties and decided that the Eighties needed a chain of love that would reach across America . " When you say it to a little kid , kiss ' em , " she recommended . I modestly declined . I got in the checkout line where , still shaken , I accidentally gave the clerk a penny instead of a dime . " Trade you this for a dime ! " she chirruped . I could n't figure out what on earth she meant for a moment , then I realized that this was her friendly way of telling me I had made a mistake . She was , I remembered , the same clerk who invariably said , " What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I do for you ? " because inverted wording is warmer . I went home and turned on the TV . It was a community-service show . The first guest was a thanatologist vaio spoke on " How to Live with Death , " followed by a psychologist engaged in discovering new minority groups , who recommended that midgets be called " persons of reduced stature . " Then came the public-service announcements . " Is someone you know starving him- or herself ? Anorexia nervosa CAN be cured if YOU help . " Followed by a paean to the environment by a paper company , featuring a celestial chorus and the slogan THANK A TREE . A smiling little woman , captioning for the hearing-impaired , was enclosed in a lower-left-hand oval like a hysterical genie in a bottle . I wait for the day when somebody will suggest that the dead be called " nonviable Americans . " It 's only a matter of time . America is the Newfoundland puppy of the world . Our obsession with friendliness began when the first settlers wondered , " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at stoic Indian faces . The natives were friendly for the most part , at least at first , but they did n't look it . Unsmiling faces have struck terror in the American heart ever since . Ask an American traveler what he thinks of a foreign country and he will reply , " The people are friendly . " The one country that he can not bestow this accolade on is that cradle of xenophobia , France . Americans are scared to death of the French . It is quite possible that the French are responsible for our compulsive Good Guyism around the world . The nastier the French get , the nicer we get . In any case , our dread of hostility is so great that it produces a strange form of treason in the American heart . Our desperation to believe . = that we are not hated personally makes us relax and grow secure whenever a terrorist with five o'clock shadow says , " It 's the American government we hate , not the American people . " z the crotchety stereotype of age that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other country . Doctors formerly in general practice are now in " family practice , " because it sounds warmer . And , incredibly , when a lad of seventeen hijacked a plane at Seattle-Tacoma Airport last summer , a crew member later stated in all seriousness that the boy was " very cooperative , he 's been almost a model hijacker . " W HY DO WE behave this way ? Politicians are fond of saying that " our diversity is our strength , " but in actual fact we are the only people in the world who can experience culture shock without leaving home . There are so many different kinds of people in America , with so many different boiling points , that we do n't know how to fight with each other . The set piece that shapes and contains quarrels in homogeneous countries does not exist here . Frenchmen are experts on the precise gradations of the obligatory " espece de , " and Italians know exactly when to introduce the subject of their mothers ' graves . But no American can be sure how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other with friendliness to neutralize potentially dangerous situations . The aloof warmth that makes life so pleasant in socially confident countries is not available to Americans , so we are forced to leap feet-first into instant cloying intimacy whether we like it or not . French charwomen call each other " madame " ; " gniidige Frau " makes old ladies easy to respect ; and macho Englishmen long ago learned to express intrasex affection with " my dear Smith . " But Americans have nothing to call each other by except first names . There is no way to get a stranger 's attention without sounding servile ( " ma'am , " " sir " ) , and so , committed as we are to equality at any price , we insult him . Friendliness is especially necessary to a people who live by the maxim , " the country is full of nuts . " The chance victim and the innocent bystander have replaced the plucky newsboy and the whore with the heart of gold as the protagonists of American folklore . The paranoid American has no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; Charles Whitman is up on his tower and all 's wrong with the world , so smile your way to safety . If you are cool to someone , he might tell the FBI lies about you , or send an anonymous letter to the IRS because he does n't like your face , so be nice to everybody . Bridges of understanding are good , but walls of friendliness are better . A multitude of virtues 0 NE NIGHT while writing this cri de coeur , I decided to rest from my labors and listen to the radio . With a drink in one hand , a cigarette in the other , and listening to Rossini , I tried to forget about America for a little while . But nobody can pull off that kind of coup . The music stopped and a voice thick with concern spoke . " Lung cancer is an equal opportunity disease . " The announcer launched into a history of cigarette smoking , pointing out that when smoking was considered unladylike , most women did not indulge and therefore did not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's disease from which women were naturally immune . " But now , " he continued happily , " women are catching up . " America , in itself a democratic disease , has become the land of the democratic disease . Our obsession with equality has gone so haywire that we go to pieces when a disease discriminates . Read an article on any disease that is widespread and you will come across The Sentence : " Hepatitis mononucleosis , herpes , the clap strikes Americans in all occupations and at all income levels , without regard to sex or race . " American blood is so rich with equality that we have come to hate uniqueness of any kind , even the most noble . By having a Tomb of the Unknowns , we really do n't have an Unknown Soldier : more than one destroys the concept . In a fit of nostalgia , a reverent " 60 Minutes " feature mourned the demise of the Orient Express without grasping the connection between its demise and our compulsion to level . Princess Dragomiroff needs Drawing Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We even condemn the unique hatred . If you hate , say , gays , it stands to reason that you undoubtedly hate blacks , Jews , Chicanos , Orientals , and Indians . To the American mind , it is worse to hate one than to hate them all . Feminists can not understand why the ERA has not been ratified by popular demand , since " polls show that a majority of Americans are for it . " What the polls actually show is that most Americans would not dare answer no to any question that contains the word equality . It was only to be expected that the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank should have triggered such Lear-like rage . Particularly upset was Mary McGrory , who suggested that breeding reliable home repairmen would benefit society far more . Her reason ? Workmen do not hear unless you scream at them , like police dogs who only respond to a certain high , piercing whistle . It is only when a certain level of frustration has been reached that he is able to judge the sincerity of the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . He may oblige if he is persuaded that apoplexy or a lawsuit is not far away . She begs the question . The attitudes to which she objects are the result of our enshrinement of equality : if everybody is as good as everybody else , why should a plumber pay attention to a syndicated columnist ? Rien que pour pisser T HE PARADOX of women 's rights in any era is that egalitarianism , which admits the issue , is also the chief barrier to its fulfillment . Just as despots are the most enthusiastic patrons of the arts , only an aristocracy is secure and eccentric enough to produce the one kind of woman who can bridge the psychological chasm between the sexes : the socially impeccable bawd . When Whig doyennes like Lady Melbourne and Lady Oxford traded knee-slappers at the Brighton gaming tables , men and women felt comfortable together . Then along came America , where no woman could be a Lady but where all women could be ladies . The result was the terminally middle-class woman who took up " niceness " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the wilderness at bay and maintaining a semblance of civilization . Confronted by her unflagging niceness , the frontier man came to think of women as his social superiors , an attitude that persists today in the American rapist 's battle cry , " You think you 're too good for me , huh ? " Our niceness factor prohibits the sophisticated intersexual camaraderie enjoyed by the French countess who explained , " Rien que pour pisser , " when she asked her male traveling companion ? a stranger ? to stop the coach by the roadside . An American man would be horrified by such blithe frankness ; under his veneer of trendy liberalism he would classify her as a " dirty girl . " Unlike the courtly Frenchman , he would refuse to stop the vehicle and would enjoy the countess 's physical discomfort and social discomfiture . He could then tell himself that she was n't so high and mighty after all ; that she was , in fact , no better than he . At first glance , it would seem that we have solved this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's an unniceness without ? lan . Instead , she has taken on what Henry James called " a certain vague moral dinginess . " The more pronounced it is , the greater her chances of getting on the " Donahue " show , where everyone will tell her how brave and liberated she is for doing whatever stomach-turning thing she has done . She can do no wrong . We save our criticism for men . Countless books and articles contain the sentence , " Men commit over 90 percent of all violent crimes , " and go on to list murky statistical evidence of the male 's apparently inborn evilness . It is all an updated version of the Victorian hatred for men 's " lower nature " and the corresponding reverence for women 's moral superiority . There 's only one catch : feminism put an end to woman as a creature of innate purity . Technically the sexes are now equal , or at least equally human . Yet men are still somehow worse . The frontier is still with us . The sexes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in a class war . America , the hagridden U NDER JIMMY CARTER America shed its last semblance of manly dignity and started playing Socrates to the world 's Xanthippe . For the first time , open aspersions were cast on the masculinity of an American president , and hence on all American men . Pakistan 's president , General Zia , advised Carter to " act like the president of a superpower " the way a man in a bar would tell another to stand up to his wife . Our own commentators took up the cudgels and , it would seem , turned to the listings under feminine in Roget to describe the Carter personality . George F. Will used " hysteria , " " shrillness , " and " frenzy . " William Safire produced " unrestrained restraint , " " self-flagellating , " " unprecedented weakness , " " acquiescing , " and the ubiquitous " caving in . " Jack Anderson used " wavering , " " waffling , " " rhetorical tsk-tsks , " " pusillanimous , " " obsequious . " " hesitancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the above , but outdid everybody after the election when he called Carter " the Mona Lisa . " Of all the words used in print and on the air , the most frequently heard was " impotent . " The Iranian crisis was a crisis of American manhood , when everybody suddenly realized what had happened to masculinity in this country . The defeat of Jimmy Carter was less political than sexual , a revulsion against the feminine principle ascendant comparable to what Lamartine called " the revolution of contempt " that occurred in France in 1848 , when the Carter-like Louis Philippe was overthrown . Louis Philippe called himself the " Citizen King . " Abhorring symbols of power , he took down the fleur-de-lys from the Palais Royal and walked through the streets of Paris wearing a plain black suit to prove he was no better than anyone else . There was nothing of the man 's man about him ; he much preferred domesticity . Says historian Priscilla Robertson : " Louis Philippe was one of those kings who distinguish themselves by being good men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his wife and children . " Everybody hates good men , especially women . They move us to lava flows of bitchiness , which explains Rosalyn Carter 's mean mouth . The good man is the one who makes a woman scream , " Do something ! " We have gotten rid of the good and timid Carter , but have we gotten rid of the feminine principle ascendant ? America shows no signs of relinquishing its gynecologist's-eye-view of life . The obsession with the family that grips Reagan-style Godand-Country conservatives is a feminine obsession . A true conservative operates on the masculine principle expressed in " I could not love thee , dear , so much , loved I not honour more . " That would never play in America , where love conquers all , including the armed services . The pseudo-conservatives are so busy trying to Save the American Family they do not see that it is this same family that is destroying America . It is impossible to escape the word . Networks call themselves " the Channel 9 Family , " advertisements tell us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for families . Touted as our greateststrength , the American family is actually the ultimate Balkanization of an already Balkanized country , the Bosnia-Herzegovina of the body politic . We have lost the masculine principle and nobody knows it better than foreign countries ; like shrewish wives , they present us with demands for weapons and aid in the form of " shopping lists " ? surely the most revealing phrase in use today . In the Sixties , men who claimed to be nonviolent often played rough , but even that is gone now ; today 's young men prefer the candlelight vigil , the classic response of Mother Machree . Manhood is expressed in silly ways , such as going out in the cold without a coat . The trek from the White House to Blair House is a favorite of hardy capons . Another way is to let it be known that you go without sleep . Diplomatic or union negotiations invariably feature an announcement that everyone involved " went twenty-five hours without sleep . " Try as we might to deny it , men do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new French Foreign Legion , the only means men have of escaping the femininity of American life . In an era of women 's sexual rights , it is also the only way left to have a normal male orgasm i.e. , a quick one . But the only completely masculine stance left to American men is a tragic and irreversible one , open to the man who chooses " to advocate and condone violence " ? against himself . Gary Gilmore and Jesse Bishop both demanded and got execution for their crimes . Both died bravely : Gilmore with stoicism and Bishop with jauntiness ? classic male responses to danger now condemned as sexist . Beau Geste is alive and well ? but not for long ? on Death Row .
