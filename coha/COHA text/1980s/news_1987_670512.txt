Fundamentally , relations between the two countries are in fine shape , especially on strategic matters . But harmony is increasingly obscured as intractable trade disputes tatter the friendship at the edges . As if to spell out the troubles in block letters , the House of Representatives is likely to embarrass Mr. Nakasone while he is in Washington by passing a tough trade bill aimed largely at Japan. // The Prime Minister ' s problems do not stop there. // This is his first trip to the United States since his remark last fall that seemed to question the intelligence of American blacks , Puerto Ricans and Mexicans . Although he apologized at the time and suggests now that he has put the episode behind him , Foreign Ministry officials say they are trying to arrange a conciliatory meeting for him with black Congressional leaders . <> <> ' I Have a Principle ' // " I am aware that public opinions and views now prevailing in the United States are severe , " Mr. Nakasone said today in an hourlong session with a group of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have a principle to bring about solutions to the various problems , one by one , in good faith. " // He is preparing for his departure in traditional fashion , by gathering together an armful of what Japanese call omiyage , or souvenirs , for his American hosts . They include a package of measures to stimulate Japan ' s economy , to buy more American goods and to increase aid to developing countries. // Some of the programs are updated editions of familiar proposals , but Mr. Nakasone rejected a suggestion that his efforts in the past had amounted to " lip service. " // He also has demands of his own . At the top of his list is a request for quick withdrawal of the retaliatory American tariffs imposed 10 days ago on selected electronic products from Japan. // On that score , the Prime Minister received some good news today when reports from Washington said President Reagan was expected to tell Mr. Nakasone that the the trade sanctions might end by June . The reports said this could occur provided Japan was found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed last July . <> <> Gauging the Time Left // Whether his meetings with President Reagan and Congressional leaders are ultimately judged to be successes or failures , they are not likely to have much effect on Mr. Nakasone ' s fallen political star at home. // Deep opposition to a sales tax that he has pressed in vain has harmed him severely , and the only question is whether his remaining time in office should be measured in months or weeks . His term expires on Oct. 31 . Supporters predict that he will hang on until then , but many politicians and commentators are not so sure . Maneuvering for the post-Nakasone era has already begun. // When the end does come , one thing seems almost certain : Yasuhiro Nakasone , who will turn 69 on May 27 , will be judged as one of the more significant Prime Ministers in Japan ' s postwar history. // More than any other postwar Prime Minister , he has committed Japan to a role in the Western alliance and has aligned the country ever more closely with overall United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has pledged - although with few discernible results - that Japan will alter its basic structure , reducing dependence on exports and putting more emphasis on domestic demand for growth. // Domestically , he has presided over the breakup of telephone and tobacco monopolies and of the deficit-hounded national railways , all matters of extreme political sensitivity . In what may prove to be his most enduring accomplishment , he has also set in motion a re-evaluation of Japan ' s educational system . <> <> An Air of Leadership // Along with substantive change , Mr. Nakasone has given the Prime Minister ' s office an air of leadership and dashing style rarely seen under his many lackluster predecessors . He is the first Japanese leader to accept the fact that he lives in a television age . Blessed with a quick wit and sober good looks , he often takes his case directly to Japanese voters , going over the heads of politicians in his long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party . Most Japanese seem to approve . Until the unpopularity of his sales-tax proposal weakened his grip on power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval ratings in public-opinion polls . His party had won a record number of seats in parliamentary elections , and he had begun to nudge Liberal Democrats away from their traditional farm constituencies and toward the big cities. // That shift could eventually have important implications for relations with the United States. // Among the looming trade issues is an increasingly insistent American call for Japan to abandon a policy of rice self-sufficiency and to accept far less expensive imports from California . Last week , senior Japanese officials flatly said no . But change may come in the long run , albeit slowly , if the ruling party readjusts its focus , taking a measure of control away from farmers and giving it to urban consumers . <> <> Some Unwelcome Developments // Amid the changes that Mr. Nakasone has brought , some Japanese see unwelcome developments. // One stems from his frequent assertion that he is a " presidential " style leader . In fact , no Japanese Prime Minister can automatically deliver on promises , as the vain attempts thus far at economic restructuring show . Any change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving consensus among diffuse power groups. // All too often , Mr. Nakasone has given Americans an incorrect impression that he can snap his fingers and make things happen . When he does not deliver , because he can not , some American see duplicity and foot-dragging. // As for the Prime Minister ' s direct appeals to voters , he is forced to do that because he is not particularly skillful at traditional backroom persuasion. // If Mr. Nakasone ' s tenure is suddenly cut short in coming weeks by a forced resignation , it will be because he had no other choice . His combativeness remains intact , as he demonstrated today by resorting to a favorite baseball metaphor. // From the start of his term in November 1982 , he said , he has been like a pitcher " facing a situation where the bases are loaded with no outs. " // Now that he faces the end , he will bear down harder , the Prime Minister suggested . " In any game , " he said , " the decisive moment is from the seventh inning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
