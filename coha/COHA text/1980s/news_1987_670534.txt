But President Reagan was the target of the most shots , and the hardest , as the conferees practiced their craft at every possible moment. // " Let me put it simply , " Jim Morris , a Reagan impressionist , said in Presidential tones of pure velvet , " because that ' s the way things are explained to me . " The " President " went on to complain that the Carter Administration had so reduced America ' s intelligence-gathering operations that he could not find out what was going on in Iran . " In 1980 , " he said , " I came into office with a severe lack of intelligence , and today we ' re paying a price for that. " // Mark Russell , one of the most visible and trenchant American humorists , said the real question about the Iran arms affair was simple : " Do jellybeans cause amnesia ? " <> <> On the President ' s Age // And Don Ferguson , a member of a Canadian radio troupe of satirists , the Royal Canadian Air Farce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging : " I may be 76 , but I have the mind of a 12-year-old. " // With anecdotes , one-liners and skits , the conferees took shots not only at Mr. Reagan but also at much of the planet ' s past and present leaders at a two-day gathering that ended Friday night in three hours of hilarity before an appreciative full house at the Academy of Music. // It was part of Philadelphia ' s observance of the bicentennial of the Constitution . True to the serious part of their task , the conferees spent much time examining the nature , utility and condition of political humor . <> <> The Balloon of Pomposity // In all societies , the consensus seemed to say , such humor offers a release valve , a way to vent frustrations over political leaders and their policies . In open societies , it is a way to " prick the balloon of pomposity , " in Mr. Ferguson ' s words , when leaders take themselves too seriously or forget their place . In closed and repressive societies like the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forbidden fruit , sustains hope and may be as necessary to people as food or sleep. // In the Philippines , said Kitch Ortego , a Filipino humorist , humor played a significant part in eroding the regime of Ferdinand E. Marcos - to many Filipinos , it was the Mink Dynasty - and preparing for its fall. // While political humor does not always travel well because of cultural and language differences , some conferees said , a surprising amount of it crops up in slightly differing forms in widely diverging societies. // A striking example was cited by Emil Draitser , a Soviet emigre who was once a satirical writer for the Soviet humor magazine Krokodil and is now a professor at Hunter College who specializes in humor . <> <> Superpowered Run for the Sun // After the joint American-Soviet space mission in 1975 , according to a Soviet street joke related by Mr. Draitser , Leonid I. Brezhnev , the Soviet leader , called to congratulate his astronauts . Now , he said , to get ahead of the Americans , the Politburo wanted to send astronauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the astronaut protested . " We ' ll be burned alive. " // " Do you think we don ' t understand anything ? " came the reply . " Don ' t worry . You will complete the landing at night . " At least two versions of the joke exist in American folk humor , Mr. Draitser said. // Russians , in long joke-telling sessions that assume great importance because of the lack of organized entertainment in the Soviet Union , have developed jokes that could easily be transposed to America , Mr. Draitser said . When Brezhnev ' s health begins to fail and there are doubts about his ability to function without being propped up , a knock comes at the leader ' s bedroom door . Brezhnev puts on his glasses , pulls a piece of paper out of a desk drawer , and reads , " Who is there ? " <> <> On How Far Humor Can Go // There was substantial discussion of the proper limits of political humor . Some thought that no limits , even those of libel , should apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others when he said , " Malice has no place in what we do ; we want to send people up , not put them down. " // Put-downs of ethnic groups are particularly odious , he said . But , it was widely acknowledged , they are universal , the target groups changing from country to country but the jokes remaining much the same. // Political humor in America today , said Mr. Russell , is probably as sharp-edged as ever . Some other participants , like Andy Rooney , the television commentator , said they thought it was sharper a quarter of a century ago when Mort Sahl was savaging politicians. // Still others , like Mr. Morris , expressed fears that American television , by establishing a low common denominator , discourages developing a sustained , more elevated brand of political humor . " It ' s a shame , " he said , " that things have to get so bad before we can appreciate political humor . " <> <> The Government is Funnier // Art Buchwald saw it somewhat differently : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far funnier than we are . " And Mr. Morris had to agree that " now Reagan is doing my act. " // Sometimes , said Mark Russell , the moderator at the conference ' s general sessions , " events overpower us . " At the height of the Gary Hart scandal , he said , " we were obsolete. " // On the prospect of a possible Presidential race between Vice President Bush and Gov . Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusettes , Mr. Russell moaned , " There isn ' t enough caffeine in the world to keep us awake for that. " // In the 200th year of the Constitution , he told his Philadelphia audience that politics in Philadelphia had gone " from Franklin and Madison to Rizzo and Goode - which proves that Darwin was wrong. " // And on the faddish taste of the American people themselves , who did not entirely escape the week ' s barbs , he looked ahead to the next century when he said : " We ' re going to have people in nursing homes with names like Heather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
