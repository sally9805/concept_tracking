Italy 's journalistic hit men <P> As a correspondent for the prestigious Milan daily Corriere della Sera , Walter Tobagi , 33 , was widely known for his writing about Italian terrorism . Too widely known . As he left his home one morning last May , two young gunmen shot him to death , then fled in a waiting Peugeot sedan . Within hours , the notorious Red Brigades claimed responsibility for the murder in a long communiqu attacking the Italian press . The bulletin was signed by a newly created branch of the terrorist organization known as the March 28 Brigade , named for the date in 1980 when four Red Brigades members died in a shootout with Genoa police . <P> Last week , after a stunning series of raids in Milan , Bologna and other cities , police officials announced that among some 70 members of the Red Brigades arrested , they had captured the entire six-member March 28 contingent . To the astonishment of many Italians , the alleged journalistic assassins included the sons of a prominent publisher , a newspaper writer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring by six young would-be terrorists who wanted to join the Red Brigades . So the Brigades gave them an initiation test : silence Tobagi . Mission accomplished , they were evidently given a second assignment : kill Giorgio Bocca , a special correspondent for Rome 's daily La Repubblica and a columnist for the weekly Italian newsmagazine L'Espresso . The plot fizzled when Bocca was alerted to two suspicious-looking young men loitering near his house last June , and called police . The men escaped . Other journalists are believed to have been marked for assassination by the March 28 group . But before the killings could be carried out , a suspected member of the group , Marco Barbone , 22 , was picked up by police last month for questioning on other terrorist activities . Barbone blurted out a confession , admitting the Tobagi murder to startled police and naming his fellow cell members . <P> Barbone 's father , Donato Barbone , is the editorial director of Sansoni , part of Rizzoli , the second largest publisher in Italy . Among the other alleged hit men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Film Critic Morando Morandini , and Francesco Giordano , 28 , a former advertising staff member at Il Giorno . <P> Friends and family members refused at first to believe that the six could be terrorists . One of the incredulous was La Repubblica Reporter Guido Passalacqua , 37 , who was wounded in Milan last May by the same gun that killed Tobagi . Last week when police showed him pictures of his accused attackers , Passalacqua recognized two of them . Said he , pointing to a photograph of Giordano : " But he 's a friend of mine . We 've had dinner together many times . He 's a friend . I do n't understand . ' ' He was not alone .
