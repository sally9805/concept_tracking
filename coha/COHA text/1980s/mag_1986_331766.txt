The title alone is provocative : Soap-Powders and Detergents . Will this be some arch exercise with dancers dressed up as bubbles or boxes ? A soggy bit of social criticism ? A spoof on Balanchine 's Snowflake Waltz in The Nutcracker ? No , Mark Morris ' latest creation , commissioned by Dance Umbrella of Cambridge , Mass. , is a lighthearted , structurally elegant look at washday . <P> The dancers somewhat resemble fresh laundry themselves in their loose white costumes . Lying on the floor , they suggest the rotating wash cycle by briskly waving their arms and legs . Later , as the action speeds up , they swing rolled- up sheets that churn around Penny Hutchinson , who plays a sort of heroine- housewife . Set to music and words by Herschel Garfein , the fantasy moves from borderline silly to giddily lyrical . Morris laughs at soap-company ad pitches but not at the washday ritual . For the indomitable housewife he has open affection . <P> Soap-Powders is a brimming piece of choreography , filled with wit and invention and a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young choreographer in the country . His Seattle-based troupe of 13 dancers is in heavy demand , and other signs of success are visible : bookings in Europe , commissions from established ballet companies ( Boston , the Joffrey ) , a program on next season 's PBS Dance in America series , invitations to pump some life into grand opera productions . ( Morris choreographed the Dance of the Seven Veils on alternating sopranos in the current Seattle Opera production of Strauss 's Salome . ) <P> Like many modern and postmodern choreographers , Morris also dances with his company . He is a riveting performer , with a delicate , Chaplinesque face atop a strong , bulbous body . For a while last year he wore his hair in a thick mass of long black curls that would have done credit to a baroque grandee . In motion he radiates amplitude verging on excess . In One Charming Night , a dance set to four Purcell songs , he presents his own outrageously funny version of the old warhorse Le Spectre de la Rose , leaping and swooping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But unlike Fokine 's blithe spirit , Morris does not finish by flying out the window . Instead , he and Weksler thrash out their all too mundane frustrations and resentments before he finally carries her off , high above his head , as if to reassert his ideal of love . One Charming Night shows both sides of Morris ' creation : ingratiating invention and , occasionally , youthful overkill of a good idea . <P> What sets Morris apart from most of his contemporaries is his extraordinary musicality . He seems open to a huge variety of styles  --  raga , rock , Poulenc , with perhaps a special affinity for such musical architects of the baroque as Vivaldi and Handel . Morris can find the dance in the music . Like Balanchine , he can hear a piece whole and render a fresh visualization of it instead of transcribing it as a pattern or making it serve as an organizing element for arbitrary action . In Jealousy , a solo set to Handel , he fills out the score with large , writhing moves and smaller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Mort Subite ( Sudden Death ) , made for the Boston Ballet , he uses a repeated figure in Poulenc 's Organ Concerto as a signal to the dancers to turn and change direction  --  often leading to their abrupt disappearance from the stage .
