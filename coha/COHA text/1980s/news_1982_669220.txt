Equally exotic is the complicated process involved in making this art form  --  an ancient and traditional skill the Chinese describe as one of their ' ' minor arts. ' ' // Cloisonne involves a surface decoration set on a metal shape set in enamel within bent wire cells that have been glued ( or soldered , in early days ) to the metal body of the box , plate , vase , or figure being made . After the cloisons have been set in their patterns  --  which could depict pictorial scenes , animals , birds , flowers , tendrils , or leaves  --  a craftsman takes a small brush or spatula and carefully spreads enamel frit mixed with distilled water and more glue to hold it in place until the firing . The object is then heated in a kiln until the frit ( made up of various oxides and ground glass ) melts . The process is repeated four or five times until the cooled enamel is level with the top of the metal cloisons . Then the whole thing is ground and polished smooth. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four centuries , having absorbed and refined the Byzantine enamel techniques that came to them via the Near East in the 14th century . Earliest authenticated examples date back to the Ming dynasty. // Cloisonne has been in continuous production since then . Modern-day visitors to China can visit the factories that produce it , watch craftspeople meticulously make it , and then buy superb contemporary examples to take home. // But you don ' t have to go to China to see modern Chinese cloisonne . It is featured in every department store ' s China promotion , in mail-order catalogs , Chinatown shops , and specialty stores across the country . The China Resource Products ( USA ) Ltd. at 1133 Avenue of the Americas in New York is an exhibition center featuring cloisonne and many other arts and handicrafts made today in Peking. // Mitch Morse , who recently opened a professional showroom called China Spectrum at 305 East 63rd Street in New York , also includes a large selection of cloisonne wares. // ' ' To me , the techniques of manufacturing cloisonne have improved over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of value , ' ' says Mr. Morse . ' ' It is my feeling that too many old pieces are chipped , dented , or banged  --  and that perfect pieces often come with prohibitively high prices . That is why I am importing new wares. ' ' // Serious collectors and auction-gallery officials point out that 20th-century cloisonne has much decorative value but no investment value . ' ' It may in a couple of hundred years , ' ' says Patricia Curtin of Sotheby ' s Chinese department , but people who want their collections to appreciate in value should buy cloisonne made in earlier centuries , preferably during the l6th and 17th centuries of the Ming dynasty. // Miss Curtin ' s advice to beginner collectors is to start with small , later Qian-long and 19th-century pieces  --  vases , incense burners , and interesting table articles  --  that are in good condition . Such small , unmarked pieces , she says , bring prices at auction ranging from $300 to $1 , 000 . If the pieces are marked , they fetch from $800 to $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , bring somewhat less than $1 , 000 on the block . Top-quality Ming pieces may bring prices up to $150 , 000. // Andy Kahane , Oriental specialist at Christie ' s auction gallery , says he is expecting to see some good 19th-century pieces of cloisonne going in the $600-$800 range in their March 23-24 Oriental sales. // Donald Wineman , a Sands Point , N.Y. , Orientalist and dealer , says cloisonne collectors are divided into two camps : those few serious collectors willing to spend from $20 , 000 to $50 , 000 for top pieces and that much larger group willing to pay prices up to $2 , 000 and $3 , 000 , which he terms the ' ' popular-price market. ' ' // Mr. Wineman contends that cloisonne collecting is good right now because it is not a ' ' hot ' ' collecting area ; the field is wide open , and many pieces are undervalued . He thinks interest will grow , as interest in all the arts of the Orient expands , and values will appreciate because there are fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , ' ' Start by buying things at reasonable prices because they are your learning tools . Once you put up your money and then begin to handle and compare and study , you will learn fast . My best tip to beginners buying old cloisonne is to examine with your fingertips as well as your eyes . You can feel damage , and repairs , and missing parts with your fingertips that your eye could miss . ' ' He sees as a problem the fact that so few real experts exist to give guidance. // Probably one of the finest collections of cloisonne in the U.S. has been put together by Robert and Marian Clague , an Arizona couple who in the early 1960 ' s studied metalworking and enameling on silver in Taxco , Mexico , and then began their collection of cloisonne. // ' ' I was fascinated with this art form that involved the unlikely marriage of enamel , a form of metal , and glass , ' ' Mr. Clague recalls . ' ' Because I had a mechanical background that included chemistry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect piece of cloisonne and knew it was a feat . I knew that metal and glass do not always expand and shrink at the same rate under heating and cooling . Glass can pull away from the bronze cloisons and shatter , or the bronze can trap gases which cause pits and bubbles in the enamel as it cools. ' ' // The Clagues collected modern and old examples made in both China and Japan . ' ' In the beginning , ' ' he says , ' ' I could not distinguish Chinese and Japanese cloisonne and could not date the pieces . Later , on the advice of Sir Harry Garner , author of ' Chinese and Japanese Cloisonne Enamels , ' we refined and edited our collection down to those antique Chinese pieces of museum quality . We eliminated all 20th-century pieces , deciding they were too perfect and too precise.

In 1980 it was exhibited by The Phoenix Art Museum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1600 to 1900 and considered to be one of the broadest in the world , is currently traveling to other museums , as well . It will be exhibited next at the Brooks Memorial Art Gallery , Memphis , Tenn. , from May 15 to June 27. // Later in the year it will be shown at the Fine Arts Museum of the South in Mobile , Ala . , ( Oct. 1-Nov. 7 ) and at the Columbus Museum of Art , Columbus , Ohio , ( Dec. 4-Jan. 16 , 1983 ) . It will then return to the Phoenix Art Museum. // //
