 | " Gee , I guess you better call them , Mr. Dussander . Or Herr Dussander , if you like that better . " He continued to smile , showing perfect teeth that had been fluoridated since the beginning of his life and bathed thrice a day in Crest toothpaste for almost as long . " After 1965 , no one saw you again .. until I did , two months ago , on the downtown bus . " " You 're insane . " " So if you want to call the police , " Todd said , smiling , " you go right ahead . I 'll wait on the stoop . But if you do n't want to call them right away , why do n't I come in ? We 'll talk . " There was a long moment while the old man looked at the smiling boy . Birds twitted in the trees . On the next block a power mower was running , and far off , on busier streets , horns honked out their own rhythm of life and commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doubt . He could n't be wrong , could he ? Was there some mistake on his part ? He did n't think so , but this was no schoolroom exercise . It was real life . So he felt a surge of relief ( mild relief , he assured himself later ) when Dussander said : " You may come in for a moment , if you like . But only because I do not wish to make trouble for you , you understand ? " " Sure , Mr. Dussander , " Todd said . He opened the screen and came into the hall . Dussander closed the door behind them , shutting off the morning . The house smelled stale and slightly malty . It smelled the way Todd 's own house smelled sometimes the morning after his folks had thrown a party and before his mother had had a chance to air it out . But this smell was worse . It was lived-in and ground-in . It was liquor , fried food , sweat , old clothes , and some stinky medicinal smell like Vick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dussander was standing too close , his head hunched into the collar of his robe like the head of a vulture waiting for some hurt animal to give up the ghost . In that instant , despite the stubble and the loosely hanging flesh , Todd could see the man who had stood inside the black SS uniform more clearly than he had ever seen him on the street . And he felt a sudden lancet of fear slide into his belly . Mild fear , he amended later .  | " I should tell you that if anything happens to me ? " he began , and then Dussander shuffled past him and into the living room , his slippers wish-wishing on the floor . He flapped a contemptuous hand at Todd , and Todd felt a flush of hot blood mount into his throat and cheeks . Todd followed him , his smile wavering for the first time . He had not pictured it happening quite like this . But it would work out . Things would come into focus . Of course they would . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped into the living room . It was another disappointment  --  and how ! ? but one he supposed he should have been prepared for . There was of course no oil portrait of Hitler with his forelock dangling and eyes that followed you . No medals in cases , no ceremonial sword mounted on the wall , no Luger or PPK Walther on the mantel ( there was , in fact , no mantel ) . Of course , Todd told himself , the guy would have to be crazy to put any of those things out where people could see them . Still , it was hard to put everything you saw in the movies or on TV out of your head . It looked like the living room of any old man living alone on a slightly frayed pension . The fake fireplace was faced with fake bricks . A Westclox hung over it . There was a black and white Motorola TV on a stand ; the tips of the rabbit ears had been wrapped in aluminum foil to improve reception . The floor was covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine rack by the sofa held copies of National Geographic , Reader 's Digest , and the L.A. Times . Instead of Hitler or a ceremonial sword hung on the wall , there was a framed certificate of citizenship and a picture of a woman in a funny hat . Dussander later told him that sort of hat was called a cloche , and they had been popular in the twenties and thirties . " My wife , " Dussander said sentimentally . " She died in 1955 of a lung disease . At that time I was working at the Menschler Motor Works in Essen . I was heartbroken . " Todd continued to smile . He crossed the room as if to get a better Tuok at the woman in the picture . Instead of looking at the picture , he fingered the shade on a small table-lamp . " Stop that ! " Dussander barked harshly . Todd jumped back a little .  | " That was good , " he said sincerely . " Really commanding . It was use Koch who had the lampshades made out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one who had the trick with the little glass tubes . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Dussander said . There was a package of Kools , the kind with no filter , on top of the TV . He offered them to Todd . " Cigarette ? " he asked , and grinned . His grin was hideous . " No . They give you lung cancer . My dad used to smoke , but he gave it up . He went to Smokenders . " " Did he . " Dussander produced a wooden match from the pocket of his robe and scratched it indifferently on the plastic case of the Motorola . Puffing , he said : " Can you give me one reason why I should n't call the police and tell them of the monstrous accusations you 've just made ? One reason ? Speak quickly , boy . The telephone is just down the hall . Your father would spank you , I think . You would sit for dinner on a cushion for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in spanking . Corporal punishment causes more problems than it cures . " Todd 's eyes suddenly gleamed . " Did you spank any of them ? The women ? Did you take off their clothes and ? " With a muffled exclamation , Dussander started for the phone . Todd said coldly : " You better not do that . " Dussander turned . In measured tones that were spoiled only slightly by the fact that his false teeth were not in , he said : " I tell you this once , boy , and once only . My name is Arthur Denker . It has never been anything else ; it has not even been Americanized . I was in fact named Arthur by my father , who greatly admired the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle . It has never been Doo-Zander , or Himmler , or Father Christmas . I was a reserve lieutenant in the war . I never joined the Nazi party . In the battle of Berlin I fought for three weeks . I will admit that in the late thirties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ended the depression and returned some of the pride we had lost in the aftermath of the sickening and unfair Treaty of Versailles . I suppose I supported him mostly because I got a job and there was tobacco again , and I did n't need to hunt through the gutters when I needed to smoke . I  | thought , in the late thirties , that he was a great man . In his own way , perhaps he was . But at the end he was mad , directing phantom armies at the whim of an astrologer . He even gave Blondi , his dog , a death-capsule . The act of a madman ; by the end they were all madmen , singing the Horst Wessel Song ' as they fed poison to their children . On May 2nd , 1945 , my regiment gave up to the Americans . I remember that a private soldier named Hackermeyer gave me a chocolate bar . I wept . There was no reason to fight on ; the war was over , and really had been since February . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We listened to the Nuremberg trials on the radio , and when Goering committed suicide , I traded fourteen American cigarettes for half a bottle of Schnaps and got drunk . When I was released , I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works until 1963 , when I retired . Later I emigrated to the United States . To come here was a lifelong ambition . In 1967 I became a citizen . I am an American . I vote . No Buenos Aires . No drug dealing . No Berlin . No Cuba . " He pronounced it Koo-ba . " And now , unless you leave , I make my telephone call . " He watched Todd do nothing . Then he went down the hall and picked up the telephone . Still Todd stood in the living room , beside the table with the small lamp on it . Dussander began to dial . Todd watched him , his heart speeding up until it was drumming in his chest . After the fourth number , 1 ) ussander turned and looked at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A boy , " he breathed . " A boy . " Todd smiled widely but rather modestly . " How did you find out ? " " One piece of luck and a lot of hard work , " Todd said . " There 's t his friend of mine , Harold Pegler his name is , only all the kids call him Foxy . He plays second base for our team . His dad 's got all t hose magazines out in his garage . Great big stacks of them . War magazines . They 're old . I looked for some new ones , but the guy who runs the newsstand across from the school says most of them went out of business . In most of them there 's pictures of krauts ? German soldiers , I mean  --  and Japs torturing these women . And  | articles about the concentration camps . I really groove on all that concentration camp stuff . " " You . . . groove on it . " Dussander was staring at him , one hand rubbing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . " Groove . You know . I get off on it . I 'm interested . " He remembered that day in Foxy 's garage as clearly as anything in his life  --  more clearly , he suspected . He remembered in the fifth grade , before Careers Day , how Mrs. Anderson ( all the kids called her Bugs because of her big front teeth ) had talked to them about what she called finding YOUR GREAT INTEREST . " It comes all at once , " Bugs Anderson had rhapsodized . " You see something for the first time , and right away you know you have found YOUR GREAT INTEREST . It 's like a key turning in a lock . Or falling in love for the first time . That 's why Careers Day is so important , children  --  it may be the day on which you find YOUR GREAT INTEREST . " And she had gone on to tell them about her own GREAT INTEREST , which turned out not to be teaching the fifth grade but collecting nineteenth-century postcards . Todd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that day in Foxy 's garage , he remembered what she had said and wondered if maybe she had n't been right after all . The Santa Anas had been blowing that day , and to the east there were brush-fires . He remembered the smell of burning , hot and greasy . He remembered Foxy 's crewcut , and the flakes of Butch Wax clinging to the front of it . He remembered everything . " I know there 's comics here someplace , " Foxy had said . 1-1 is mother had a hangover and had kicked them out of the house for making too much noise . " Neat ones . They 're Westerns , mostly , but there 's some Turok , Son of Stone and ? " " What are those ? " Todd asked , pointing at the bulging cardboard cartons under the stairs . " Ah , they 're no good , " Foxy said . " True war stories , mostly . Boring . " " Can I look at some ? " " Sure . I 'll find the comics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , lodd no longer wanted to read comics . He was lost . Utterly lust ,  | It 's like a key turning in a lock . Or falling in love for the first time . It had been like that . He had known about the war , of course  --  not the stupid one going on now , where the Americans had gotten the shit kicked out of them by a bunch of gooks in black pajamas  --  but World War II . He knew that the Americans wore round helmets with net on them and the krauts wore sort of square ones . He knew that the Americans won most of the battles and that the Germans had invented rockets near the end and shot them from Germany onto London . He had even known something about the concentration camps . The difference between all of that and what he found in the magazines under the stairs in Foxy 's garage was like the difference between being told about germs and then actually seeing them in a microscope , squirming around and alive . Here was use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their soot-clotted hinges . Here were officers in SS uniforms and prisoners in striped uniforms . The smell of the old pulp magazines was like the smell of the brush-fires burning out of control on the east of Santo Donato , and he could feel the old paper crumbling against the pads of his fingers , and he turned the pages , no longer in Foxy 's garage but caught somewhere crosswise in time , trying to cope with the idea that they had really done those things , that somebody had really done those things , and that somebody had let them do those things , and his head began to ache with a mixture of revulsion and excitement , and his eyes were hot and strained , but he read on , and from a column of print beneath a picture of tangled bodies at a place called Dachau , this figure jumped out at him : 6 , 000 , 000 . And he thought : Somebody goofed there , somebody added a zero or two , that 's twice as many people as there are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover of this one showed a woman chained to a wall while a guy in a Nazi uniform approached her with a poker in his hand and a grin on his face ) , he saw it again : 6,000,000. 1 ! is headache got worse . His mouth went dry . Dimly , from some distance , he heard Foxy saving he had to go in for suhher . ' Ihdd  | asked Foxy if he could stay out here in the garage and read while Foxy ate . Foxy gave him a look of mild puzzlement , shrugged , and said sure . And Todd read , hunched over the boxes of the old true war magazines , until his mother called and asked if he was ever going to go home . Like a key turning in a lock . All the magazines said it was bad , what had happened . But all the stories were continued at the back of the book , and when you turned to those pages , the words saying it was bad were surrounded by ads , and these ads sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trusses and Guaranteed Hair Restorer . These ads sold German flags emblazoned with swastikas and Nazi Lugers and a game called Panzer Attack as well as correspondence lessons and offers to make you rich selling elevator shoes to short men . They said it was bad , but it seemed like a lot of people must not mind . Like falling in love . Oh yes , he remembered that day very well . He remembered everything about it  --  a yellowing pin-up calendar for a defunct year on the back wall , the oil-stain on the cement floor , the way the magazines had been tied together with orange twine . He remembered how his headache had gotten a little worse each time he thought of that incredible number , 6,000,000 . He remembered thinking : I want to know about everything that happened in those places . Everything . And I want to know which is more true  --  the words , or the ads they put beside the words . He remembered Bugs Anderson as he at last pushed the boxes back under the stairs and thought : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dussander looked at Todd for a long time . Then he crossed the living room and sat down heavily in a rocking chair . He looked at Todd again , unable to analyze the slightly dreamy , slightly nostalgic expression on the boy 's face . " Yeah . It was the magazines that got me interested , but I figured a lot of what they said was just , you know , bullspit . So I went to the library and found out a lot more stuff . Some of it was even neater .  | At first the crummy librarian did n't want me to look at any of it because it was in the adult section of the library , but I told her it was for school . If it 's for school they have to let you have it . She called my dad , though . " Todd 's eyes turned up scornfully . " Like she thought Dad did n't know what I was doing , if you can dig that . " " He did know ? " " Sure . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they can  --  the bad as well as the good . Then they 'll be ready for it . He says life is a tiger you have to grab by the tail , and if you do n't know the nature of the beast it will eat you up . " " Mmmm , " Dussander said . " My mom thinks the same way . " " Mmmmm . " Dussander looked dazed , not quite sure where he was . " Anyhow , " Todd said , " the library stuff was real good . They must have had a hundred books with stuff in them about the Nazi concentration camps , just here in the Santo Donato library . A lot of people must like to read about that stuff . There were n't as many pictures as in Foxy 's dad 's magazines , but the other stuff was real gooshy . Chairs with spikes sticking up through the seats . Pulling out gold teeth with pliers . Poison gas that came out of the showers . " Todd shook his head . " You guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " " Gooshy , " Dussander said heavily . " I really did do a research paper , and you know what I got on it ? An A-plus . Of course I had to be careful . You have to write that stuff in a certain way . You got to be careful . " " Do you ? " Dussander asked . He took another cigarette with a hand that trembled . " Oh yeah . All those library books , they read a certain way . Like the guys who wrote them got puking sick over what they were writing about . " Todd was frowning , wrestling with the thought , trying to bring it out . The fact that tone , as that word is applied to writing , was n't yet in his vocabulary , made it more difficult . " They all write like they lost a lot of sleep over it . How we 've got to be careful so nothing like that ever happens again . I made my paper like that , and I guess the teacher gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without losing my lunch . " Once more , Todd smiled winningly . Dussander dragged heavily on his unfiltered Kool . The tip trembled slightly . As he feathered smoke out of his nostrils , he coughed an old man 's dank , hollow cough . " I can hardly believe this conversation is taking place , " he said . He leaned forward and peered closely at Todd . " Boy , do you know the word ' existential-ism ' ? " Todd ignored the question . " Did you ever meet Ilse Koch ? " " Ilse Koch ? " Almost inaudibly , Dussander said : " Yes . I met her . " " Was she beautiful ? " Todd asked eagerly . " I mean ... " His hands described an hourglass in the air . " Surely you have seen her photograph ? " Dussander asked . " An aficionado such as yourself ? " " What 's an of . . . aff . . . " " An aficionado , " Dussander said , " is one who grooves . One who . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cool . " Todd 's grin , puzzled and weak for a moment , shone out triumphantly again . " Sure , I 've seen her picture . But you know how they are in those books . " He spoke as if Dussander had them all . " Black and white , fuzzy . . . just snapshots . None of those guys knew they were taking pictures for , you know , history . Was she really stacked ? " " She was fat and dumpy and she had bad skin , " Dussander said shortly . He crushed his cigarette out half-smoked in a Table Talk pie-dish filled with dead butts . " Oh . Golly . " Todd 's face fell . " Just luck , " Dussander mused , looking at Todd . " You saw my picture in a war-adventures magazine and happened to ride next to me on the bus . Tcha ! " He brought a fist down on the arm of his chair , but without much force . " No sir , Mr. Dussander . There was more to it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning forward . " Oh ? Really ? " The bushy eyebrows rose , signalling polite disbelief . " Sure . I mean , the pictures of you in my scrapbook were all thirty years old . at least . I mean . it is 1974. "  | " You keep a . . . a scrapbook ? " " Oh , yes , sir ! It 's a good one . Hundreds of pictures . I 'll show it to you sometime . You 'll go ape . " Dussander 's face pulled into a revolted grimace , but he said nothing . " The first couple of times I saw you , I was n't sure at all . And then you got on the bus one day when it was raining , and you had this shiny black slicker on ? " " That , " Dussander breathed . " Sure . There was a picture of you in a coat like that in one of the magazines out in Foxy 's garage . Also , a photo of you in your SS greatcoat in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just said to myself , It 's for sure . That 's Kurt Dussander . ' So I started to shadow you ? " " You did what ? " " Shadow you . Follow you . My ambition is to be a private detective like Sam Spade in the books , or Mannix on TV . Anyway , I was super careful . I did n't want you to get wise . Want to look at some pictures ? " Todd took a folded-over manila envelope from his back pocket . Sweat had stuck the flap down . He peeled it back carefully . His eyes were sparkling like a boy thinking about his birthday , or Christmas , or the firecrackers he will shoot off on the Fourth of July . " You took pictures of me ? " " Oh , you bet . I got this little camera . A Kodak . It 's thin and flat and fits right into your hand . Once you get the hang of it , you can take pictures of the subject just by holding the camera in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens peek through . Then you hit the button with your thumb . " Todd laughed modestly . " I got the hang of it , but I took a lot of pictures of my fingers while I did . I hung right in there , though . I think a person can do anything if they try hard enough , you know it ? It 's corny but true . " Kurt Dussander had begun to look white and ill , shrunken inside his robe . " Did you have these pictures finished by a commercial developer , boy ? " " Huh ? " Todd looked shocked and startled , then contemptuous .  | " No ! What do you think I am , stupid ? My dad 's got a darkroom . I 've been developing my own pictures since I was nine . " Dussander said nothing , but he relaxed a little and some color came back into his face . Todd handed him several glossy prints , the rough edges confirming that they had been home-developed . Dussander went through them , silently grim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downtown bus , with a copy of the latest James Michener , Centennial , in his hands . Here he was at the Devon Avenue bus stop , his umbrella under his arm and his head cocked back at an angle which suggested De Gaulle at his most imperial . Here he was standing on line just under the marquee of the Majestic Theater , erect and silent , conspicuous among the leaning teenagers and blank-faced housewives in curlers by his height and his bearing . Finally , here he was peering into his own mailbox . " I was scared you might see me on that one , " Todd said . " It was a calculated risk . I was right across the street . Boy oh boy , I wish I could afford a Minolta with a telephoto lens . Someday . . . " Todd looked wistful . " No doubt you had a story ready , just in case . " " I was going to ask you if you 'd seen my dog . Anyway , after I developed the pix , I compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs . He had seen them all before , many times . The first showed him in his office at the Patin resettlement camp ; it had been cropped so nothing showed but him and the Nazi flag on its stand by his desk . The second was a picture that had been taken on the day of his enlistment . The last showed him shaking hands with Heinrich Gluecks , who had been subordinate only to Himmler himself . " I was pretty sure then , but I could n't see if you had the harelip because of your goshdamn moustache . But I had to be sure , so I got this . " He handed over the last sheet from his envelope . It had been folded over many times . Dirt was grimed into the creases . The corners were lopped and milled  --  the way papers get when they spend a long time in the pockets of young boys who have no shortage of things to do and places to go . It was a copy of ' the Israeli  | want-sheet on Kurt Dussander . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were unquiet and refused to stay buried . " I took your fingerprints , " Todd said , smiling . " And then I did the compares to the one on the sheet . " Dussander gaped at him and then uttered the German word for shit . " You did not ! " " Sure I did . My mom and dad gave me a fingerprint set for Christmas last year . A real one , not just a toy . It had the powder and three brushes for three different surfaces and special paper for lifting them . My folks know I want to be a PI when I grow up . Of course , they think I 'll grow out of it . " He dismissed this idea with a disinterested lift and drop of his shoulders . " The book explained all about whorls and lands and points of similarity . They 're called compares . You need eight compares for a fingerprint to get accepted in court . " So anyway , one day when you were at the movies , I came here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . Pretty smart , huh ? " Dussander said nothing . He was clutching the arms of his chair , and his toothless , deflated mouth was trembling . Todd did n't like that . It made him look like he was on the verge of tears . That , of course , was ridiculous . The Blood-Fiend of Patin in tears ? You might as well expect Chevrolet to go bankrupt or McDonald 's to give up burgers and start selling caviar and truffles . " I got two sets of prints , " Todd said . " One of them did n't look anything like the ones on the wanted poster . I figured those were the postman 's . The rest were yours . I found more than eight compares . I found fourteen good ones . " He grinned . " And that 's how I did it . " " You are a little bastard , " Dussander said , and for a moment his eyes shone dangerously . Todd felt a tingling little thrill , as he had in the hall . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No one . " " Not even this friend ? This Cony Pegler ? " " Foxy . Foxy Pegler . Nah , he 's a blabbermouth . I have n't told anybody . There 's nobody I trust that much . "  | " What do you want ? Money ? There is none , I 'm afraid . In South America there was , although it was nothing as romantic or dangerous as the drug trade . There is  --  there was  --  a kind of ' old boy network ' in Brazil and Paraguay and Santo Domingo . Fugitives from the war . I became part of their circle and did modestly well in minerals and ores  --  tin , copper , bauxite . Then the changes came . Nationalism , anti-Americanism . I might have ridden out the changes , but then Wiesenthal 's men caught my scent . Bad luck follows bad luck , boy , like dogs after a bitch in heat . Twice they almost had me ; once I heard the Jew-bastards in the next room . " They hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck , and his eyes had become as round as the eyes of a child listening to the darkest passage of a scary tale ? " Hansel and Gretel , " perhaps , or " Bluebeard . " " He was an old man , of no danger to anyone . He was apolitical . Still , they hanged him . " Todd nodded . " At last , I went to the only people who could help me . They had helped others , and I could run no more . " " You went to the Odessa ? " Todd asked eagerly . " To the Sicilians , " Dussander said dryly , and Todd 's face fell again . " It was arranged . False papers , false past . Would you care for a drink , boy ? " " Sure . You got a Coke ? " " No Coke . " He pronounced it Kok . " Milk ? " " Milk . " Dussander went through the archway and into the kitchen . A fluorescent bar buzzed into life . " I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stocks I picked up after the war under yet another name . Through a bank in the State of Maine , if you please . The banker who bought them for me went to jail for murdering his wife a year after I bought them . . . life is sometimes strange , boy , hein ? " A refrigerator door opened and closed . " The Sicilian jackals did n't know about those stocks , " he said . " Today the Sicilians are everywhere , but in those days , Boston was as far north as they could be found . If they had known , they would have had those as well . They would have picked me clean and sent me to America to starve on welfare and food stamps . "  | Todd heard a cupboard door opened ; he heard liquid poured into a glass . " A little General Motors , a little American Telephone and Telegraph , a hundred and fifty shares of Revlon . All this banker 's choices . Dufresne , his name was  --  I remember , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so smart at wife-killing as he was at picking growth stocks . The crime passionel , boy . It only proves that all men are donkeys who can read . " He came back into the room , slippers whispering . He held two green plastic glasses that looked like the premiums they sometimes gave out at gas station openings . When you filled your tank , you got a free glass . Dussander thrust a glass at Todd . " I lived adequately on the stock portfolio this Dufresne had set up for me for the first five years I was here . But then I sold my Diamond Match stock in order to buy this house and a small cottage not far from Big Sur . Then , inflation . Recession . I sold the cottage and one by one I sold the stocks , many of them at fantastic profits . I wish to God I had bought more . But I thought I was well-protected in other directions ; the stocks were , as you Americans say , a flier ... ' " He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bored . He had not come here to listen to Dussander whine about his money or mutter about his stocks . The thought of blackmailing Dussander had never even crossed Todd 's mind . Money ? What would he do with it ? He had his allowance ; he had his paper route . If his monetary needs went higher than what these could provide during any given week , there was always someone who needed his lawn mowed . Todd lifted his milk to his lips and then hesitated . His smile shone out again . . . an admiring smile . He extended the gas station premium glass to Dussander . " You have some of it , " he said slyly . Dussander stared at him for a moment , uncomprehending , and then rolled his bloodshot eyes . " Griiss Gott ! " He took the glass , swallowed twice , and handed it back . " No gasping for breath . No clawing at the Croat . No smell of bitter almonds . It is milk , boy . Milk . From the Dairylea Farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow . "  | Todd watched him warily for a moment , then took a small sip . Yes , it tasted like milk , sure did , but somehow he did n't feel very thirsty anymore . He put the glass down . Dussander shrugged , raised his own glass , and took a swallow . He smacked his lips over it . " Schnaps ? " Todd asked . " Bourbon . Ancient Age . Very nice . And cheap . " Todd fiddled his fingers along the seams of his jeans . " So , " Dussander said , " if you have decided to have a flier ' of your own , you should be aware that you have picked a worthless stock . " " Huh ? " " Blackmail , " Dussander said . " Is n't that what they call it on Mannix and Hawaii Five-0 and Barnaby Jones ? Extortion . If that was what ? " But Todd was laughing  --  hearty , boyish laughter . He shook his head , tried to speak , could not , and went on laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked gray and more frightened than he had since he and Todd had begun to speak . He took another large swallow of his drink , grimaced , and shuddered . " I see that is not it . . . at least , not the extortion of money . But , though you laugh , I smell extortion in it somewhere . What is it ? Why do you come here and disturb an old man ? Perhaps , as you say , I was once a Nazi . SS , even . Now I am only old , and to have a bowel movement I have to use a suppository . So what do you want ? " Todd had sobered again . He stared at Dussander with an open and appealing frankness . " Why . . . I want to hear about it . That 's all . That 's all I want . Really . " " Hear about it ? " Dussander echoed . He looked utterly perplexed . Todd leaned forward , tanned elbows on bluejeaned knees . " Sure . The firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys who had to dig their own graves and then stand on the ends so they 'd fall into them . The . . . " His tongue came out and wetted his lips . " The examinations . The experiments . Everything . All the gooshy stuff . " Dussander stared at him with a certain amazed detachment , the way a veterinarian might stare at a cat who was giving birth to a succession of two-headed kittens . " You are a monster , " he said softly .  | Todd sniffed . " According to the books I read for my report , you 're the monster , Mr. Dussander . Not me . You sent them to the ovens , not me . Two thousand a day at Patin before you came , three thousand after , thirty-five hundred before the Russians came and made you stop . Himmler called you an efficiency expert and gave you a medal . So you call me a monster . Oh boy . " " All of that is a filthy American lie , " Dussander said , stung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourbon onto his hand and the table . " The problem was not of my making , nor was the solution . I was given orders and directives , which I followed . " Todd 's smile widened ; it was now almost a smirk . " Oh , I know how the Americans have distorted that , " Dussander muttered . " But your own politicians make our Dr. Goebbels look like a child playing with picture books in a kindergarten . They speak of morality while they douse screaming children and old women in burning napalm . Your draft-resisters are called cowards and peaceniks . ' For refusing to follow orders they are either put in jails or scourged from the country . Those who demonstrate against this country 's unfortunate Asian adventure are clubbed down in the streets . The GI soldiers who kill the innocent are decorated by Presidents , welcomed home from the bayoneting of children and the burning of hospitals with parades and bunting . They are given dinners , Keys to the City , free tickets to pro football games . " He toasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lose are tried as war criminals for following orders and directives . " He drank and then had a coughing fit that brought thin color to his cheeks . Through most of this Todd fidgeted the way he did when his parents discussed whatever had been on the news that night  --  good old Walter Klondike , his dad called him . He did n't care about Dussander 's politics any more than he cared about Dussander 's stocks . His idea was that people made up politics so they could do things . Like when he wanted to feel around under Sharon Ackerman 's dress last year . Sharon said it was bad for him to want to do that , even though he could tell from her tone of voice that the idea sort of excited her . So he told her he wanted to be a doctor when he grew up and then she let him . That was politics . He wanted to hear about German doctors trying to mate women with  | dogs , putting identical twins into refrigerators to see whether they would die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last longer , and electroshock therapy , and operations without anesthetic , and German soldiers raping all the women they wanted . The rest was just so much tired bullspit to cover up the gooshy stuff after someone came along and put a stop to it . " HI had n't followed orders , I would have been dead . " Dussander was breathing hard , his upper body rocking back and forth in the chair , making the springs squeak . A little cloud of liquor-smell hung around him . " There was always the Russian front , nicht wahr ? Our leaders were madmen , granted , but does one argue with madmen . . . especially when the maddest of them all has the luck of Satan . He escaped a brilliant assassination attempt by inches . Those who conspired were strangled with piano-wire , strangled slowly . Their death-agonies were filmed for the edification of the elite ? " " Yeah ! Neat ! " Todd cried impulsively . " Did you see that movie ? " " Yes . I saw . We all saw what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind and wait for the storm to end . What we did then was the right thing . For that time and that place , it was the right thing . I would do it again . But ... " His eyes dropped to his glass . It was empty . ... but I do n't wish to speak of it , or even think of it . What we did was motivated only by survival , and nothing about survival is pretty . I had dreams . . . " He slowly took a cigarette from the box on the TV . " Yes . For years I had them . Blackness , and sounds in the blackness . Tractor engines . Bulldozer engines . Gunbutts thudding against what might have been frozen earth , or human skulls . Whistles , sirens , pistol-shots , screams . The doors of cattlecars rumbling open on cold winter afternoons . " Then , in my dreams , all sounds would stop  --  and eyes would open in the dark , gleaming like the eyes of animals in a rainforest . For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I suppose that is why it is always the jungle I smelled and felt in those dreams . When I woke from them I would be drenched with sweat , my heart thundering in my chest , my hand stuffed into my mouth to stifle the screams . And I would think : The dream is the truth . Brazil ,  | Paraguay , Cuba . . . those places are the dream . In the reality I am still at Patin . The Russians are closer today than yesterday . Some of them are remembering that in 1943 they had to eat frozen German corpses to stay alive . Now they long to drink hot German blood . There were rumors , boy , that some of them did just that when they crossed into Germany : cut the t'roats of some prisoners and drank their blood out of a boot . I would wake up and think : The work must go on , if only so there is no evidence of what we did here , or so little that the world , which does n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would think : The work must go on if we are to survive . " Todd listened to this with close attention and great interest . This was pretty good , but he was sure there would be better stuff in the days ahead . All Dussander needed was a little prodding . Heck , he was lucky . Lots of men his age were senile . Dussander dragged deeply on his cigarette . " Later , after the dreams went away , there were days when I would think I had seen someone from Patin . Never guards or fellow officers , always inmates . I remember one afternoon in West Germany , ten years ago . There was an accident on the Autobahn . Traffic was frozen in every lane . I sat in my Morris , listening to the radio , waiting for the traffic to move . I looked to my right . There was a very old Simca in the next lane , and the man behind the wheel was looking at me . He was perhaps fifty , and he looked ill . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , short , cut badly . I looked away . The minutes passed and still the traffic did n't move . I began snatching glances at the man in the Simca . Every time I did , he was looking at me , his face as still as death , his eyes sunken in their sockets . I became convinced he had been at Patin . He had been there and he had recognized me . " Dussander wiped a hand across his eyes . " It was winter . The man was wearing an overcoat . But I was convinced that if I got out of my car and went to him , made him take off his coat and push up his shirtsleeves , I would see the number on his arm . " At last the traffic began to move again . I pulled away from the Simca . If the jam had lasted another ten minutes , I believe I would have gotten out of my car and pulled the old man out of his . I would  | have beaten him , number or no number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . " Shortly after that , I left Germany forever . " " Lucky for you , " Todd said . Dussander shrugged . " It was the same everywhere . Havana , Mexico City , Rome . I was in Rome for three years , you know . I would see a man looking at me over his cappuccino in a cafe . . . a woman in a hotel lobby who seemed more interested in me than in her magazine . . . a waiter in a restaurant who would keep glancing at me no matter whom he was serving . I would become convinced that these people were studying me , and that night the dream would come  --  the sounds , the jungle , the eyes . " But when I came to America I put it out of my mind . I go to movies . I eat out once a week , always at one of those fast-food places that are so clean and so well-lighted by fluorescent bars . Here at my house I do jigsaw puzzles and I read novels  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At night I drink until I 'm sleepy . The dreams do n't come anymore . When I see someone looking at me in the supermarket or the library or the tobacconist 's , I think it must be because I look like their grandfather . . . or an old teacher . . . or a neighbor in a town they left some years ago . " He shook his head at Todd . " Whatever happened at Patin , it happened to another man . Not to me . " " Great ! " Todd said . " I want to hear all about it . " Dussander 's eyes squeezed closed , and then opened slowly . " You do n't understand . I do not wish to speak of it . " " You will , though . If you do n't , I 'll tell everyone who you are . " Dussander stared at him , gray-faced . " I knew , " he said , " that I would find the extortion sooner or later . " " Today I want to hear about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked them after they were dead . " His smile beamed out , rich and radiant . " But put your teeth in before you start . You look better with your teeth in . " Dussander did as he was told . He talked to Todd about the gas ovens until Todd had to go home for lunch . Every time he tried to slip over into generalities , Todd would frown severely and ask him specific questions to get him back on the track . Dussander drank a great deal as he talked . He did n't smile . Todd smiled . 7idd smiled enough for both of them .  | August , 1974 . They sat on Dussander 's back porch under a cloudless , smiling sky . Todd was wearing jeans , Keds , and his Little League shirt . Dussander was wearing a baggy gray shirt and shapeless khaki pants held up with suspenders  --  wino-pants , Todd thought with private contempt ; they looked like they had come straight from a box in the back of the Salvation Army store downtown . He was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed when he was at home . It spoiled some of the fun . The two of them were eating Big Macs that Todd had brought in his bike-basket , pedaling fast so they would n't get cold . Todd was sipping a Coke through a plastic straw . Dussander had a glass of bourbon . His old man 's voice rose and fell , papery , hesitant , sometimes nearly inaudible . His faded blue eyes , threaded with the usual snaps of red , were never still . An observer might have thought them grandfather and grandson , the latter perhaps attending some rite of passage , a handing down . " And that 's all I remember , " Dussander finished presently , and took a large bite of his sandwich . McDonald 's Secret Sauce dribbled down his chin . " You can do better than that , " Todd said softly . Dussander took a large swallow from his glass . " The uniforms were made of paper , " he said finally , almost snarling . " When one inmate died , the uniform was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one paper uniform could dress as many as forty inmates . I received high marks for my frugality . " " From Gluecks ? " " From Himmler . " " But there was a clothing factory in Patin . You told me that just last week . Why did n't you have the uniforms made there ? The inmates themselves could have made them . " " The job of the factory in Patin was to make uniforms for German soldiers . And as for us . . . " Dussander 's voice faltered for a moment , and then he forced himself to go on . " We were not in the business of rehabilitation , " he finished .  | Todd smiled his broad smile . " Enough for today ? Please ? My throat is sore . " " You should n't smoke so much , then , " Todd said , continuing to smile . " Tell me some more about the uniforms . " " Which ? Inmate or SS ? " Dussander 's voice was resigned . Smiling , Todd said : " Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen of his house , making himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . You got to the kitchen by going up half a dozen redwood steps to a raised area that gleamed with chrome and stainless steel . His mother 's electric typewriter had been going steadily ever since Todd had gotten home from school . She was typing a master 's thesis for a grad student . The grad student had short hair , wore thick glasses , and looked like a creature from outer space , in Todd 's humble opinion . The thesis was on the effect of fruitflies in the Salinas Valley after World War II , or some good shit like that . Now her typewriter stopped and she came out of her office . " Todd-baby , " she greeted him . " Monica-baby , " he hailed back , amiably enough . His mother was n't a bad-looking chick for thirty-six , Todd thought ; blonde hair that was streaked ash in a couple of places , tall , shapely , now dressed in dark red shorts and a sheer blouse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below her breasts , putting her flat , unlined midriff on show . A typewriter eraser was tucked into her hair , which had been pinned carelessly back with a turquoise clip . " So how 's school ? " she asked him , coming up the steps into the kitchen . She brushed his lips casually with hers and then slid onto one of the stools in front of the breakfast counter . " School 's cool . " " Going to be on the honor roll again ? " " Sure . " Actually , he thought his grades might slip a notch this first quarter . He had been spending a lot of time with Dussander ,  | and when he was n't actually with the old kraut , he was thinking about the things Dussander had told him . Once or twice he had dreamed about the things Dussander had told him . But it was nothing he could n't handle . " Apt pupil , " she said , ruffling his shaggy blonde hair . " How 's that sandwich ? " " Good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it into my office ? " " Ca n't , " he said , getting up . " I promised Mr. Denker I 'd come over and read to him for an hour or so . " " Are you still on Robinson Crusoe ? " " Nope . " He showed her the spine of a thick book he had bought in a junkshop for twenty cents . " Tom Jones . " " Ye gods and little fishes ! It 'll take you the whole school-year to get through that , Todd-baby . Could n't you at least find an abridged edition , like with Crusoe ? " " Probably , but he wanted to hear all of this one . He said so . " " Oh . " She looked at him for a moment , then hugged him . It was rare for her to be so demonstrative , and it made Todd a little uneasy . " You 're a peach to be taking so much of your spare time to read to him . Your father and I think it 's just . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down modestly . " And to not want to tell anybody , " she said . " Hiding your light under a bushel . " " Oh , the kids I hang around with  --  they 'd probably think I was some kind of weirdo , " Todd said , smiling modestly down at the floor . " All that good shit . " " Do n't say that , " she admonished absently . Then : " Do you think Mr. Denker would like to come over and have dinner with us some night ? " " Maybe , " Todd said vaguely . " Listen , I got ta put an egg in my shoe and beat it . " " Okay . Supper at six-thirty . Do n't forget . " " I wo n't . " " Your father 's got to work late so it 'll just be me and thee again , okay ? " " Crazy , baby . "  | She watched him go with a fond smile , hoping there was nothing in Tom Jones he should n't be reading ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was growing up in a society where magazines like Penthouse were available to anyone with a dollar and a quarter , or to any kid who could reach up to the top shelf of the magazine rack and grab a quick peek before the clerk could shout for him to put that up and get lost . In a society that seemed to believe most of all in the creed of hump thy neighbor , she did n't think there could be much in a book two hundred years old to screw up Todd 's head  --  although she supposed the old man might get off on it a little . And as Richard liked to say , for a kid the whole world 's a laboratory . You have to let them poke around in it . And if the kid in question has a healthy home life and loving parents , he 'll be all the stronger for having knocked around a few strange corners . And there went the healthiest kid she knew , pedaling up the street on his Schwinn . We did okay by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwich . Damned if we did n't do okay . 4 October , 1974 . Dussander had lost weight . They sat in the kitchen , the shopworn copy of Tom Jones between them on the oilcloth-covered table ( Todd , who tried never to miss a trick , had purchased the Cliff 's Notes on the book with part of his allowance and had carefully read the entire summary against the possibility that his mother or father might ask him questions about the plot ) . Todd was eating a Ring Ding he had bought at the market . He had bought one for Dussander , but Dussander had n't touched it . He only looked at it morosely from time to time as he drank his bourbon . Todd hated to see anything as tasty as Ring Dings go to waste . If he did n't eat it pretty quick , Todd was going to ask him if he could have it . " So how did the stuff get to Patin ? " he asked Dussander . " In railroad cars , " Dussander said . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crates that looked like coffins . Fitting , I suppose . The inmates off-loaded the crates and stacked  | them in the infirmary . Later , our own men stacked them in the storage sheds . They did it at night . The storage sheds were behind the showers . " " Was it always Zyklon-B ? " " No , from time to time we would be sent something else . Experimental gases . The High Command was always interested in improving efficiency . Once they sent us a gas code-named PEGASUS . A nerve-gas . Thank God they never sent it again . It ? " Dussander saw Todd lean forward , saw those eyes sharpen , and he suddenly stopped and gestured casually with his gas station premium glass . " It did n't work very well , " he said . " It was . . . quite boring . " But Todd was not fooled , not in the least . " What did it do ? " " It killed them  --  what did you think it did , made them walk on water ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me . " " No , " Dussander said , now unable to hide the horror he felt . He had n't thought of PEGASUS in . . . how long ? Ten years ? Twenty ? " I wo n't tell you ! I refuse ! " " Tell me , " Todd repeated , licking chocolate icing from his fingers . " Tell me or you know what . " Yes , Dussander thought . I know what . Indeed I do , you putrid little monster . " It made them dance , " he said reluctantly . " Dance ? " " Like the Zyklon-B , it came in through the shower-heads . And they . . . they began to leap about . Some were screaming . Most of t hem were laughing . They began to vomit , and to . . . to defecate helplessly . " " Wow , " Todd said . " Shit themselves , huh ? " He pointed at the Ring Ding on Dussander 's plate . He had finished his own . " You going to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hazed with memory . His face was far away and cold , like the dark side of a planet which does not rotate . Inside his mind he felt the queerest combination of revulsion and  --  could it be ? ? nostalgia ? They began to twitch all over and to make high , strange sounds in their throats . My men . . . they called PFGASUS the Yodeling  | Gas . At last they all collapsed and just lay there on the floor in their own filth , they lay there , yes , they lay there on the concrete , screaming and yodeling , with bloody noses . But I lied , boy . The gas did n't kill them , either because it was n't strong enough or because we could n't bring ourselves to wait long enough . I suppose it was that . Men and women like that could not have lived long . Finally I sent in five men with rifles to end their agonies . It would have looked bad on my record if it had shown up , I 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had declared every cartridge a national resource . But those five men I trusted . There were times , boy , when I thought I would never forget the sound they made . The yodeling sound . The laughing . " " Yeah , I bet , " Todd said . He finished Dussander 's Ring Ding in two bites . Waste not , want not , Todd 's mother said on the rare occasions when Todd complained about left-overs . " That was a good story , Mr. Dussander . You always tell them good . Once I get you going . " Todd smiled at him . And incredibly  --  certainly not because he wanted to  --  Dussander found himself smiling back . 5 November , 1974 . Dick Bowden , Todd 's father , looked remarkably like a movie and TV actor named Lloyd Bochner . He  --  Bowden , not Bochner  --  was thirty-eight . He was a thin , narrow man who liked to dress in Ivy League  --  style shirts and solid-color suits , usually dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore khakis and a hard-hat that was a souvenir of his Peace Corps days , when he had helped to design and build two dams in Africa . When he was working in his study at home , he wore half-glasses that had a way of slipping down to the end of his nose and making him look like a college dean . He was wearing these glasses now as he tapped his son 's first-quarter report card against his desk 's gleaming glass top . " One B. Four C 's . One D. A D , for Christ 's sake ! Todd , your mother 's not showing it , but she 's really upset . "  | Todd dropped his eyes . He did n't smile . When his dad swore , that was n't exactly the best of news . " My God , you 've never gotten a report like this . A D in Beginning Algebra ? What is this ? " " I do n't know , Dad . " He looked humbly at his knees . " Your mother and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Denker . Not hitting the books enough . We think you ought to cut it down to weekends , slugger . At least until we see where you 're going academically ... " Todd looked up , and for a single second Bowden thought he saw a wild , pallid anger in his son 's eyes . His own eyes widened , his fingers clenched on Todd 's buff-colored report card . . . and then it was just Todd , looking at him openly if rather unhappily . Had that anger really been there ? Surely not . But the moment had unsettled him , made it hard for him to know exactly how to proceed . Todd had n't been mad , and Dick Bowden did n't want to make him mad . He and his son were friends , always had been friends , and Dick wanted things to stay that way . They had no secrets from each other , none at all ( except for the fact that Dick Bowden was sometimes unfaithful with his secretary , but that was n't exactly the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . and besides , that had absolutely no bearing on his home life , his family life ) . That was the way it was supposed to be , the way it had to be in a cockamamie world where murderers went unpunished , high school kids skin-popped heroin , and junior high schoolers  --  kids Todd 's age  --  turned up with VD . " No , Dad , please do n't do that . I mean , do n't punish Mr. Denker for something that 's my fault . I mean , he 'd be lost without me . I 'll do better . Really . That algebra . . . it just threw me to start with . But I went over to Ben Tremaine 's , and after we studied together for a few days , I started to get it . I just . . . I du n no , I sorta choked at first . " " I think you 're spending too much time with him , " Bowden said , but he was weakening . It was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said about punishing the old man for Iix1d 's filling-off . . . goddammit , it made sense . The old man looked forward to his visits so much .  | " That Mr. Storrman , the algebra teacher , is really hard , " Todd said . " Lots of kids got D 's . Three or four got F 's . " Bowden nodded thoughtfully . " I wo n't go Wednesdays anymore . Not until I bring my grades up . " He had read his father 's eyes . " And instead of going out for anything at school , I 'll stay after every day and study . I promise . " " You really like the old guy that much ? " " He 's really neat , " Tod said sincerely . " Well . . . okay . We 'll try it your way , slugger . But I want to see a big improvement in your marks come January , you understand me ? I 'm thinking of your future . You may think junior high 's too soon to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a long chalk . " As his mother liked to say Waste not , want not , so Dick Bowden liked to say Not by a long chalk . " I understand , Dad , " Todd said gravely . Man-to-man stuff . " Get out of here and give those books a workout then . " He pushed his half-glasses up on his nose and clapped Todd on the shoulder . Todd 's smile , broad and bright , broke across his face . " Right on , Dad ! " Bowden watched Todd go with a prideful smile of his own . One in a million . And that had n't been anger on Todd 's face . For sure . Pique , maybe . . . but not that high-voltage emotion he had at first thought he 'd seen there . If Todd was that mad , he would have known ; he could read his son like a book . It had always been that way . Whistling , his fatherly duty discharged , Dick Bowden unrolled a blueprint and bent over it . 6 December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd 's insistent finger on the bell was haggard and yellowed . The hair , which had been lush in July , had now begun to recede from the bony brow ; it looked lusterless and brittle . Dussander 's body , thin to begin with , was now gaunt . . . although , Todd thought , he was nowhere near as gaunt as the inmates who had once been delivered into his hands .  | Todd 's left hand had been behind his back when Dussander came to the door . Now he brought it out and handed a wrapped package to Dussander . " Merry Christmas ! " he yelled . Dussander had cringed from the box ; now he took it with no expression of pleasure or surprise . He handled it gingerly , as if it might contain explosive . Beyond the porch , it was raining . It had been raining off and on for almost a week , and Todd had carried the box inside his coat . It was wrapped in gay foil and ribbon . " What is it ? " Dussander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Open it and see . " Todd took a can of Coke from his jacket pocket and put it on the red and white checked oilcloth that covered the kitchen table . " Better pull down the shades , " he said confidentially . Distrust immediately leaked onto Dussander 's face . " Oh ? Why ? " " Well . . . you can never tell who 's lookin , " Todd said , smiling . " Is n't that how you got along all those years ? By seeing the people who might be lookin before they saw you ? " Dussander pulled down the kitchen shades . Then he poured himself a glass of bourbon . Then he pulled the bow off the package . Todd had wrapped it the way boys so often wrap Christmas packages  --  boys who have more important things on their minds , t pings like football and street hockey and the Friday Nite Creature Feature you 'll watch with a friend who 's sleeping over , the two of you wrapped in a blanket and crammed together on one end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged corners , a lot of uneven seams , a lot of Scotch tape . It spoke of impatience with such a womanly thing . Dussander was a little touched in spite of himself . And later , when the horror had receded a little , he thought : I should have known . It was a uniform . An SS uniform . Complete with jackboots . I le looked numbly from the contents of the box to its cardboard Cover : PETER 'S QUALITY COSTUME CLOTHIERS  --  AT THE SAME LOCATION SINCE 1951 ! " No , " he said softly . " I wo n't put it on . This is where it ends , boy . I 'll die before I put it on . " " Remember what they did to Eichmann , " Todd said solemnly .  | " He was an old man and he had no politics . Is n't that what you said ? Besides , I saved the whole fall for it . It cost over eighty bucks , with the boots thrown in . You did n't mind wearing it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You little bastard ! " Dussander raised one fist over his head . Todd did n't flinch at all . He stood his ground , eyes shining . " Yeah , " he said softly . " Go ahead and touch me . You just touch me once . " Dussander lowered the hand . His lips were quivering . " You are a fiend from hell , " he muttered . " Put it on , " Todd invited . Dussander 's hands went to the tie of his robe and paused there . His eyes , sheeplike and begging , looked into Todd 's . " Please , " he said . " I am an old man . No more . " Todd shook his head slowly but firmly . His eyes were still shining . He liked it when Dussander begged . The way they must have begged him once . The inmates at Patin . Dussander let the robe fall to the floor and stood naked except for his slippers and his boxer shorts . His chest was sunken , his belly slightly bloated . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform , Todd thought . The uniform will make a difference . Slowly , Dussander took the tunic out of the box and began to put it on . Ten minutes later he stood fully dressed in the SS uniform . The cap was slightly askew , the shoulders slumped , but still the death's-head insignia stood out clearly . Dussander had a dark dignity  --  at least in Todd 's eyes  --  that he had not possessed earlier . In spite of his slump , in spite of the cockeyed angle of his feet , Todd was pleased . For the first time Dussander looked to Todd as Todd believed he should look . Older , yes . Defeated , certainly . But in uniform again . Not an old man spinning away his sunset years watching Lawrence Welk on a cruddy black and white TV with tinfoil on the rabbit ears , but Kurt Dussander , The Blood-Fiend of Patin . As for Dussander , he felt disgust , discomfort . . . and a mild , sneaking sense of relief . He partly despised this latter emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological domination the boy had established over him . He was the boy 's prisoner , and every time he found he could live through yet another indignity , every time he felt that mild relief , the boy 's power grew . And yet he was relieved . It was only cloth and buttons and snaps and it was a sham at that . The fly was a zipper ; it should have been buttons . The marks of rank were wrong , the tailoring sloppy , the boots a cheap grade of imitation leather . It was only a trumpery uniform after all , and it was n't exactly killing him , was it ? No . It  --   --  " Straighten your cap ! " Todd said loudly . Dussander blinked at him , startled . " Straighten your cap , soldier ! " Dussander did so , unconsciously giving it that final small insolent twist that had been the trademark of his Oberleutnantsand , sadly wrong as it was , this was an Oberleutnant 's uniform . " Get those feet together ! " He did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the correct thing with hardly a thought , doing it as if the intervening years had slipped off along with his bathrobe . " Achtung ! " He snapped to attention , and for a moment Todd was scared ? really scared . He felt like the sorcerer 's apprentice , who had brought the brooms to life but who had not possessed enough wit to stop them once they got started . The old man living in genteel poverty was gone . Dussander was here . Then his fear was replaced by a tingling sense of power . " About face ! " Dussander pivoted neatly , the bourbon forgotten , the torment of the last four months forgotten . He heard his heels click together again as he faced the grease-splattered stove . Beyond it , he could see the dusty parade ground of the military academy where he had learned his soldier 's trade . " About face ! " He whirled again , this time not executing the order as well , losing his balance a little . Once it would have been ten demerits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending his breath out in a  | hot and agonized gust . Inwardly he smiled a little . The boy did n't know all the tricks . No indeed . " Now march ! " Todd cried . His eyes were hot , glowing . The iron went out of Dussander 's shoulders ; he slumped forward again . " No , " he said . " Please ? " " March ! March ! March , I said ! " With a strangled sound , Dussander began to goose-step across the faded linoleum of his kitchen floor . He right-faced to avoid the table ; right-faced again as he approached the wall . His face was uptilted slightly , expressionless . His legs rammed out before him , then crashed down , making the cheap china rattle in the cabinet over the sink . His arms moved in short arcs . The image of the walking brooms recurred to Todd , and his fright recurred with it . It suddenly struck him that he did n't want Dussander to be enjoying any part of this , and that perhaps  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ludicrous even more than he had wanted to make him appear authentic . But somehow , despite the man 's age and the cheap dime-store furnishings of the kitchen , he did n't look ludicrous in the least . He looked frightening . For the first time the corpses in the ditches and the crematoriums seemed to take on their own reality for Todd . The photographs of the tangled arms and legs and torsos , fishbelly white in the cold spring rains of Germany , were not something staged like a scene in a horror film  --  a pile of bodies created from departmentstore dummies , say , to be picked up by the grips and propmen when the scene was done  --  but simply a real fact , stupendous and inexplicable and evil . For a moment it seemed to him that he could smell the bland and slightly smoky odor of decomposition . Terror gathered him in . " Stop ! " he shouted . Dussander continued to goose-step , his eyes blank and far away . His head had come up even more , pulling the scrawny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrogant angle . His nose , blade-thin , jutted obscenely . Todd felt sweat in his armpits . " Halt ! " he cried out . Dussander halted , right foot forward , left coming up and then down beside the right with a single pistonlike stamp . hor a moment  | the cold lack of expression held on his face  --  robotic , mindless ? and then it was replaced by confusion . Confusion was followed by defeat . He slumped . Todd let out a silent breath of relief and for a moment he was furious with himself . Who 's in charge here , anyway ? Then his self-confidence flooded back in . I am , that 's who . And he better not forget it . He began to smile again . " Pretty good . But with a little practice , I think you 'll be a lot better . " Dussander stood mute , panting , his head hanging . " You can take it off now , " Todd added generously . . . and could n't help wondering if he really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds there 7 January , 1975 . Todd left school by himself after the last bell , got his bike , and pedaled down to the park . He found a deserted bench , set his Schwinn up on its kickstand , and took his report card out of his hip pocket . He took a look around to see if there was anyone in the area he knew , but the only other people in sight were two high school kids making out by the pond and a pair of gross-looking winos passing a paper bag back and forth . Dirty fucking winos , he thought , but it was n't the winos that had upset him . He opened his card . English : C. American History : C. Earth Science : D. Your Community and You : B. Primary French : F. Beginning Algebra : F. He stared at the grades , unbelieving . He had known it was going to be bad , but this was disaster . Maybe that 's best , an inner voice spoke up suddenly . Maybe you even did it on purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Needs for it to end . Before something bad happens . He shoved the thought roughly aside . Nothing bad was going to Ii.tppen . Dussander was under his thumb . Totally under his thumb . ' I'Ihc old man thought one of Todd 's friends had a letter , but he did n't know which friend . If anything happened to Todd  --  anything  | ? that letter would go to the police . Once he supposed Dussander might have tried it anyway . Now he was too old to run , even with a head start . " He 's under control , dammit , " Todd whispered , and then pounded his thigh hard enough to make the muscle knot . Talking to yourself was bad shit  --  - crazy people talked to themselves . He had picked up the habit over the last six weeks or so , and did n't seem able to break it . He 'd caught several people looking at him strangely because of it . A couple of them had been teachers . And that asshole Bernie Everson had come right out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come very , very close to punching the little pansy in the mouth , and that sort of stuff ? brawls , scuffles , punch-outs  --  was no good . That sort of stuff got you noticed in all the wrong ways . Talking to yourself was bad , right , okay , but " The dreams are bad , too , " he whispered . He did n't catch himself that time . Just lately the dreams had been very bad . In the dreams he was always in uniform , although the type varied . Sometimes it was a paper uniform and he was standing in line with hundreds of gaunt men ; the smell of burning was in the air and he could hear the choppy roar of bulldozer engines . Then Dussander would come up the line , pointing out this one or that one . They were left . The others were marched away toward the crematoriums . Some of them kicked and struggled , but most were too undernourished , too exhausted . Then Dussander was standing in front of Todd . Their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dussander levelled a faded umbrella at Todd . " Take this one to the laboratories , " Dussander said in the dream . His lip curled back to reveal his false teeth . " Take this American boy . In another dream he wore an SS uniform . His jackboots were shined to a mirrorlike reflecting surface . The death's-head insignia and the lightning-bolts glittered . But he was standing in the middle of Santo Donato Boulevard and everyone was looking at him . They began to point . Some of them began to laugh . Others looked shocked , angry , or revolted . In this dream an old car came to  | a squalling , creaky halt and Dussander peered out at him , a Dussander who looked two hundred years old and nearly mummified , his skin a yellowed scroll . " I know you ! " the dream-Dussander proclaimed shrilly . He looked around at the spectators and then back to Todd . " You were in charge at Patin ! Look , everybody ! This is The Blood-Fiend of Patin ! Himmler 's Efficiency Expert ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , butcher ! I denounce you , killer of infants ! I denounce you ! " In yet another dream , he wore a striped convict 's uniform and was being led down a stone-walled corridor by two guards who looked like his parents . Both wore conspicuous yellow armbands with the Star of David on them . Walking behind them was a minister , reading from the Book of Deuteronomy . Todd looked back over his shoulder and saw that the minister was Dussander , and he was wearing the black tunic of an SS officer . At the end of the stone corridor , double doors opened on an octagonal room with glass walls . There was a scaffold in the center of it . Behind the glass walls stood ranks of emaciated men and women , all naked , all watching with the same dark , flat expression . On each arm was a blue number . " It 's all right , " Todd whispered to himself . " It 's okay , really , everything 's under control . " The couple that had been making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely , daring them to say anything . At last they looked back the other way . Had the boy been grinning ? Todd got up , jammed his report card into his hip pocket , and mounted his bike . He pedaled down to a drugstore two blocks away . There he bought a bottle of ink eradicator and a fine-point hen that dispensed blue ink . He went back to the park ( the tii.ike-out couple was gone , but the winos were still there , stinking t h e place up ) and changed his English grade to a B , American I listory to A , Earth Science to B , Primary French to C , and Beginning Algebra to B. Your Community and You he eradicated and then simply wrote in again , so the card would have a uniform look . l ' ai/ ) rms , right .  | " Never mind , " he whispered to himself . " That 'll hold them . That 'll hold them , all right . " One night late in the month , sometime after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping and moaning , into a darkness that seemed close and terrifying . He felt half-suffocated , paralyzed with fear . It was as if a heavy stone lay on his chest , and he wondered if he could be having a heart attack . He clawed in the darkness for the bedside lamp and almost knocked it off the nightstand turning it on . I 'm in my own room , he thought , my own bedroom , here in Santo Donato , here in California , here in America . See , the same brown drapes pulled across the same window , the same bookshelves filled with dime paperbacks from the bookshop on Soren Street , same gray rug , same blue wallpaper . No heart attack . No jungle . No eyes . But the terror still clung to him like a stinking pelt , and his heart went on racing . The dream had come back . He had known that it would , sooner or later , if the boy kept on . The cursed boy . He thought the boy 's letter of protection was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that ; something he had picked up from the TV detective programs . What friend would the boy trust not to open such a momentous letter ? No friend , that was who . Or so he thought . If he could be sure His hands closed with an arthritic , painful snap and then opened slowly . He took the packet of cigarettes from the table and lit one , scratching the wooden match on the bedpost . The clock 's hands stood at 2:41 . There would be no more sleep for him this night . He inhaled smoke and then coughed it out in a series of racking spasms . No more sleep unless he wanted to go downstairs and have a drink or two . Or three . And there had been altogether too much drinking over the last six weeks or so . He was no longer a young man who could toss them off one after the other , the way he had when he had been an officer on leave in Berlin in ' 39 , when t he scent of victory had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice , saw his blazing , commanding eyes ?  | The boy . . . the cursed boy ! " Be honest , " he said aloud , and the sound of his own voice in the quiet room made him jump a little . He was not in the habit of talking to himself , but neither was it the first time he had ever done so . He remembered doing it off and on during the last few weeks at Patin , when everything had come down around their ears and in the east the sound of Russian thunder grew louder first every day and then every hour . It had been natural enough to talk to himself then . He had been under stress , and people under stress often do strange things  --  cup their testicles through the pockets of their pants , click their teeth together . . . Wolff had been a great teeth-clicker . He grinned as he did it . Huffmann had been a finger-snapper and a thigh-patter , creating fast , intricate rhythms that he seemed utterly unaware of . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now " You are under stress again , " he said aloud . He was aware that he had spoken in German this time . He had n't spoken German in many years , but the language now seemed warm and comfortable . It lulled him , eased him . It was sweet and dark . " Yes . You are under stress . Because of the boy . But be honest with yourself . It is too early in the morning to tell lies . You have not entirely regretted talking . At first you were terrified that the boy could not or would not keep his secret . He would have to tell a friend , who would tell another friend , and that friend would tell two . But if he has kept it this long , he will keep it longer . If I am taken away , he loses his . . . his talking book . Is that what I am to him ? I think so . " He fell silent , but his thoughts went on . He had been lonely ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been times when he thought almost seriously of suicide . He made a bad hermit . The voices he heard came from the radio . The only people who visited were on the other side of a dirty glass square . He was an old man , and although he was afraid of death , he was more afraid of being an old man who is alone . 1 Iis bladder sometimes tricked him . He would be halfway to the bathroom when a dark stain spread on his pants . In wet weather his ' oinrs would first throb and then begin to cry out , and there had  | been days when he had chewed an entire tin of Arthritis Pain Formula between sunrise and sunset . . and still the aspirin only subdued the aches . Even such acts as taking a book from the shelf or switching the TV channel became an essay in pain . His eyes were bad ; sometimes he knocked things over , barked his shins , bumped his head . He lived in fear of breaking a bone and not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fear of getting there and having some doctor uncover his real past as he became suspicious of Mr. Denker 's nonexistent medical history . The boy had alleviated some of those things . When the boy was here , he could call back the old days . His memory of those days was perversely clear ; he spilled out a seemingly endless catalogue of names and events , even the weather of such and such a day . He remembered Private Henreid , who manned a machine-gun in the northeast tower and the wen private Henreid had had between his eyes . Some of the men called him Three-Eyes , or Old Cyclops . He remembered Kessel , who had a picture of his girlfriend naked , lying on a sofa with her hands behind her head . Kessel charged the men to ' look at it . He remembered the names of the doctors and their experiments  --  thresholds of pain , the brainwaves of dying men and women , physiological retardation , effects of different sorts of radiation , dozens more . Hundreds more . He supposed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he guessed he was luckier than most old men , who had impatience , disinterest , or outright rudeness for an audience . His audience was endlessly fascinated . Were a few bad dreams too high a price to pay ? He crushed out his cigarette , lay looking at the ceiling for a moment , and then swung his feet out onto the floor . He and the boy were loathsome , he supposed , feeding off each other . . . eating each other . If his own belly was sometimes sour with the dark but rich food they partook of in his afternoon kitchen , what was the boy 's like ? Did he sleep well ? Perhaps not . Lately Dussander thought the boy looked rather pale , and thinner than when he had first come into Dussander 's life . He walked across the bedroom and opened the closet door . 1 le brushed hangers to the right , reached into the shadows , and  | brought out the sham uniform . It hung from his hand like a vulture-skin . He touched it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then stroked it . After a very long time he took it down and put it on , dressing slowly , not looking into the mirror until the uniform was completely buttoned and belted ( and the sham fly zipped ) . He looked at himself in the mirror , then , and nodded . He went back to bed , lay down , and smoked another cigarette . When it was finished , he felt sleepy again . He turned off the bedlamp , not believing it , that it could be this easy . But he was asleep five minutes later , and this time his sleep was dreamless. 8 February , 1975 . After dinner , Dick Bowden produced a cognac that Dussander privately thought dreadful . But of course he smiled broadly and complimented it extravagantly . Bowden 's wife served the boy a chocolate malted . The boy had been unusually quiet all through the meal . Uneasy ? Yes . For some reason the boy seemed very uneasy . Dussander had charmed Dick and Monica Bowden from the moment he and the boy had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vision was much worse than it actually was ( which made poor old Mr. Denker in need of a Seeing Eye dog , Dussander thought dryly ) , because that explained all the reading the boy had supposedly been doing . Dussander had been very careful about that , and he thought there had been no slips . He was dressed in his best suit , and although the evening was damp , his arthritis had been remarkably mellow  --  nothing but an occasional twinge . For some absurd reason the boy had wanted him to leave his umbrella home , but Dussander had insisted . All in all , he had had a pleasant and rather exciting evening . Dreadful cognac or no , he had not been out to dinner in nine years . During the meal he had discussed the Essen Motor Works , the rebuilding of postwar Germany  --  Bowden had asked several intelligent questions about that , and had seemed impressed by I ) ussander 's answers  --  and German writers . Monica Bowden had  | asked him how he had happened to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper expression of myopic sorrow , had explained about the death of his fictitious wife . Monica Bowden was meltingly sympathetic . And now , over the absurd cognac , Dick Bowden said : " If this is too personal , Mr. Denker , please do n't answer . . . but I could n't help wondering what you did in the war . " The boy stiffened ever so slightly . Dussander smiled and felt for his cigarettes . He could see them perfectly well , but it was important to make not the tiniest slip . Monica put them in his hand . " Thank you , dear lady . The meal was superb . You are a fine cook . My own wife never did better . " Monica thanked him and looked flustered . Todd gave her an irritated look . " Not personal at all , " Dussander said , lighting his cigarette and turning to Bowden . " I was in the reserves from 1943 on , as were all able-bodied men too old to be in the active services . By then the handwriting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the madmen who created it . One madman in particular , of course . " He blew out his match and looked solemn . " There was great relief when the tide turned against Hitler . Great relief . Of course , " and here he looked at Bowden disarmingly , as man to man , " one was careful not to express such a sentiment . Not aloud . " " I suppose not , " Dick Bowden said respectfully . " No , " Dussander said gravely . " Not aloud . I remember one evening when four or five of us , all friends , stopped at a local Ratskeller after work for a drink  --  by then there was not always Schnaps , or even beer , but it so happened that night there were both . We had all known each other for upwards of twenty years . One of our number , Hans Hassler , mentioned in passing that perhaps the Fuehrer had been ill-advised to open a second front against the Russians . I said , Hans , God in Heaven , watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the subject entirely . Yet three days later he was gone . I never saw him again , nor , as far as I know , did anyone else who was sitting at our table that nivhr "  | " How awful ! " Monica said breathlessly . " More cognac , Mr. Denker ? " " No thank you . " He smiled at her . " My wife had a saying from her mother : One must never overdo the sublime . ' " Todd 's small , troubled frown deepened slightly . " Do you think he was sent to one of the camps ? " Dick asked . " Your friend Hessler ? " " Hassler , " Dussander corrected gently . He grew grave . " Many were . The camps . . . they will be the shame of the German people for a thousand years to come . They are Hitler 's real legacy . " " Oh , I think that 's too harsh , " Bowden said , lighting his pipe and puffing out a choking cloud of Cherry Blend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the German people had no idea of what was going on . The locals around Auschwitz thought it was a sausage plant . " " Ugh , how terrible , " Monica said , and pulled a grimacing that's-enough-of-that expression at her husband . Then she turned to Dussander and smiled . " I just love the smell of a pipe , Mr. Denker , do n't you ? " " Indeed I do , madam , " Dussander said . He had just gotten an almost insurmountable urge to sneeze under control . Bowden suddenly reached across the table and clapped his son on the shoulder . Todd jumped . " You 're awfully quiet tonight , son . Feeling all right ? " Todd offered a peculiar smile that seemed divided between his father and Dussander . " I feel okay . I 've heard most of these stories before , remember . " " Todd ! " Monica said . " That 's hardly ? " " The boy is only being honest , " Dussander said . " A privilege of boys which men often have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick laughed and nodded . " Perhaps I could get Todd to walk back to mine house with me now , " Dussander said . " I 'm sure he has his studies . " " Todd is a very apt pupil , " Monica said , but she spoke almost automatically , looking at Todd in a puzzled sort of way . " All A 's and B 's , usually . He got a C this last quarter , but he 's promised to bring his French up to snuff on his March report . Right , Todd-baby ? "  | Todd offered the peculiar smile again and nodded . " No need for you to walk , " Dick said . " I 'll be glad to run you back to your place . " " I walk for the air and the exercise , " Dussander said . " Really , I must insist . . . unless Todd prefers not to . " " Oh , no , I 'd like a walk , " Todd said , and his mother and father beamed at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke the silence . It was drizzling , and he hoisted his umbrella over both of them . And yet still his arthritis lay quiet , dozing . It was amazing . " You are like my arthritis , " he said . Todd 's head came up . " Huh ? " " Neither of you have had much to say tonight . What 's got your tongue , boy ? Cat or cormorant ? " " Nothing , " Todd muttered . They turned down Dussander 's street . " Perhaps I could guess , " Dussander said , not without a touch of malice . " When you came to get me , you were afraid I might make a slip . . . ' let the cat out of the bag , ' you say here . Yet you were determined to go through with the dinner because you had run out of excuses to put your parents off . Now you are disconcerted that all went well . Is that not the truth ? " " Who cares ? " Todd said , and shrugged sullenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dussander demanded . " I was dissembling before you were born . You keep a secret well enough , I give you that . I give it to you most graciously . But did you see me tonight ? I charmed them . Charmed them ! " Todd suddenly burst out : " You did n't have to do that ! " Dussander came to a complete stop , staring at Todd . " Not do it ? Not ? I thought that was what you wanted , boy ! Certainly they will offer no objections if you continue to come over and ' read ' to me . " " You 're sure taking a lot for granted ! " Todd said hotly . " Maybe I 've got all I want from you . Do you think there 's anybody forcing me to come over to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up booze  | like those old wino pusbags that hang around the old trainyards ? Is that what you think ? " His voice had risen and taken on a thin , wavering , hysterical note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to come , I 'll come , and if I do n't , I wo n't . " " Lower your voice . People will hear . " " Who cares ? " Todd said , but he began to walk again . This time he deliberately walked outside the umbrella 's span . " No , nobody forces you to come , " Dussander said . And then he took a calculated shot in the dark : " In fact , you are welcome to stay away . Believe me , boy , I have no scruples about drinking alone . None at all . " Todd looked at him scornfully . " You 'd like that , would n't you ? " Dussander only smiled noncommittally . " Well , do n't count on it . " They had reached the concrete walk leading up to Dussander 's stoop . Dussander fumbled in his pocket for his latchkey . The arthritis flared a dim red in the joints of his fingers and then subsided , waiting . Now Dussander thought he understood what it was waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could come out . " I 'll tell you something , " Todd said . He sounded oddly breathless . " If they knew what you were , if I ever told them , they 'd spit on you and then kick you out on your skinny old ass . " Dussander looked at Todd closely in the drizzling dark . The boy 's face was turned defiantly up to his , but the skin was pallid , the sockets under the eyes dark and slightly hollowed  --  the skin-tones of someone who has brooded long while others are asleep . " I am sure they would have nothing but revulsion for me , " I ) ussander said , although he privately thought that the elder Bowden might stay his revulsion long enough to ask many of the questions his son had asked already . " Nothing but revulsion . But what would they feel for you , boy , when I told them you had known about me for eight months . . and said nothing ? " lodd stared at him wordlessly in the dark . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferently , " ; end stay home if you do n't . Goodnight , boy . " I lc went up the walk to his front door , leaving Todd standing in the drizzle and looking after him with his mouth slightly ajar .  | The next morning at breakfast , Monica said : " Your dad liked Mr. Denker a lot , Todd . He said he reminded him of your grandfather . " Todd muttered something unintelligible around his toast . Monica looked at her son and wondered if he had been sleeping well . He looked pale . And his grades had taken that inexplicable dip . Todd never got C 's . " You feeling okay these days , Todd ? " He looked at her blankly for a moment , and then that radiant smile spread over his face , charming her . . . comforting her . There was a dab of strawberry preserves on his chin . " Sure , " he said . " Four-oh . " " Todd-baby , " she said . " Monica-baby , " he responded , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kitty-kitty , " Dussander said . " Heeere , kitty-kitty . Puss-puss ? Puss-puss ? " He was sitting on his back stoop , a pink plastic bowl by his right foot . The bowl was full of milk . It was one-thirty in the afternoon ; the day was hazy and hot . Brush-fires far to the west tinged the air with an autumnal smell that jagged oddly against the calendar . If the boy was coming , he would be here in another hour . But the boy did n't always come now . Instead of seven days a week he came sometimes only four times , or five . An intuition had grown in him , little by little , and his intuition told him that the boy was having troubles of his own . " Kitty-kitty , " Dussander coaxed . The stray cat was at the far end of the yard , sitting in the ragged verge of weeds by Dussander 's fence . It was a tom , and every bit as ragged as the weeds it sat in . Every time he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never left the pink bowl filled with milk . Perhaps , Dussander thought , the boy was having troubles with his studies . Or bad dreams . Or both . That last made him smile .  | " Kitty-kitty , " he called softly . The cat 's ears cocked forward again . It did n't move , not yet , but it continued to study the milk . Dussander had certainly been afflicted with problems of his own . For three weeks or so he had worn the SS uniform to bed like grotesque pajamas , and the uniform had warded off the insomnia and the bad dreams . His sleep had been  --  at first  --  as sound as a lumberjack 's . Then the dreams had returned , not little by little , but all at once , and worse than ever before . Dreams of running as well as the dreams of the eyes . Running through a wet , unseen jungle where heavy leaves and damp fronds struck his face , leaving trickles that felt like sap . . . or blood . Running and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , until he broke into a clearing . In the darkness he sensed rather than saw the steep rise that began on the clearing 's far side . At the top of that rise was Patin , its low cement buildings and yards surrounded by barbed wire and electrified wire , its sentry towers standing like Martian dreadnoughts straight out of War of the Worlds . And in the middle , huge stacks billowed smoke against the sky , and below these brick columns were the furnaces , stoked and ready to go , glowing in the night like the eyes of fierce demons . They had told the inhabitants of the area that the Patin inmates made clothes and candles , and of course the locals had believed that no more than the locals around Auschwitz had believed that the camp was a sausage factory . It did n't matter . Looking back over his shoulder in the dream , he would at last see them coming out of hiding , the restless dead , the Juden , shambling toward him with blue numbers glaring from the livid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talons , their faces no longer expressionless but animated with hate , lively with vengeance , vivacious with murder . Toddlers ran beside their mothers and grandfathers were borne up by their middle-aged children . And the dominant expression on all their faces was desperation . Desperation ? Yes . Because in the dreams he knew ( and so did they ) that if he could climb the hill , he would be safe . Down here in these wet and swampy lowlands , in this jungle where the nightflowering plants extruded blood instead of sap , he was a hunted animal . . . prey . But up there , he was in command . If this was a  | jungle , then the camp at the top of the hill was a zoo , all the wild animals safely in cages , he the head keeper whose job it was to decide which would be fed , which would live , which would be handed over to the vivisectionists , which would be taken to the knacker 's in the remover 's van . He would begin to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightmare . He would feel the first skeletal hands close about his neck , feel their cold and stinking breath , smell their decay , hear their birdlike cries of triumph as they pulled him down with salvation not only in sight but almost at hand " Kitty-kitty , " Dussander called . " Milk . Nice milk . " The cat came at last . It crossed half of the back yard and then sat again , but lightly , its tail twitching with worry . It did n't trust him ; no . But Dussander knew the cat could smell the milk and so he was sanguine . Sooner or later it would come . At Patin there had never been a contraband problem . Some of the prisoners came in with their valuables poked far up their asses in small chamois bags ( and how often their valuables turned out not to be valuable at all  --  photographs , locks of hair , fake jewelry ) , often pushed up with sticks until they were past the point where even the long fingers of the trusty they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had had a small diamond , flawed , it turned out , really not valuable at all  --  but it had been in her family for six generations , passed from mother to eldest daughter ( or so she said , but of course she was a Jew and all of them lied ) . She swallowed it before entering Patin . When it came out in her waste , she swallowed it again . She kept doing this , although eventually the diamond began to cut her insides and she bled . There had been other ruses , although most only involved petty items such as a hoard of tobacco or a hair-ribbon or two . It did n't matter . In the room Dussander used for prisoner interrogations there was a hotplate and a homely kitchen table covered with a red checked cloth much like the one in his own kitchen . There was always a pot of lamb stew bubbling mellowly away on that hotplate . When contraband was suspected ( and when was it not ? ) a member of the suspected clique would be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotplate , where the rich fumes from the - Cr. , . ( : nnl .. L.n a .. ns , Irl er rhnm lY/h , , Yihi is hi. inn 11nJ.1 )  | Who is hiding jewelry ? Who has tobacco ? Who gave the Givenet woman the pill for her baby ? Who ? The stew was never specifically promised ; but always the aroma eventually loosened their tongues . Of course , a truncheon would have done the same , or a gun-barrel jammed into their filthy crotches , but the stew was . . . was elegant . Yes . " Kitty-kitty , " Dussander called . The cat 's ears cocked forward . It half-rose , then half-remembered some long-ago kick , or perhaps a match that had burned its whiskers , and it settled back on its haunches . But soon it would move . He had found a way of propitiating his nightmare . It was , in a way , no more than wearing the SS uniform ... but raised to a greater power . Dussander was pleased with himself , only sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed he had the boy to thank for this new method of quieting himself , for showing him that the key to the past 's terrors was not in rejection but in contemplation and even something like a friend 's embrace . It was true that before the boy 's unexpected arrival last summer he had n't had any bad dreams for a long time , but he believed now that he had come to a coward 's terms with his past . He had been forced to give up a part of himself . Now he had reclaimed it . " Kitty-kitty , " called Dussander , and a smile broke on his face , a kindly smile , a reassuring smile , the smile of all old men who have somehow come through the cruel courses of life to a safe place , still relatively intact , and with at least some wisdom . The torn rose from its haunches , hesitated only a moment longer , and then trotted across the remainder of the back yard with lithe grace . It mounted the steps , gave Dussander a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears ; then it began to drink the milk . " Nice milk , " Dussander said , pulling on the Playtex rubber gloves that had lain in his lap all the while . " Nice milk for a nice kitty . " He had bought these gloves in the supermarket . He had stood in the express lane , and older women had looked at him approvingly , even speculatively . The gloves were advertised on TV . They had cuffs . They were so flexible you could pick up a dime while you were wearing them . I It stroked the cat 's back with one green finger and talked to it  | soothingly . Its back began to arch with the rhythm of his strokes . Just before the bowl was empty , he seized the cat . It came electrically alive in his clenching hands , twisting and jerking , clawing at the rubber . Its body lashed limberly back and forth , and Dussander had no doubt that if its teeth or claws got into him , it would come off the winner . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dussander thought , grinning . Holding the cat prudently away from his body , the painful grin stamped on his face , Dussander pushed the back door open with his foot and went into the kitchen . The cat yowled and twisted and ripped at the rubber gloves . Its feral , triangular head flashed down and fastened on one green thumb . " Nasty kitty , " Dussander said reproachfully . The oven door stood open . Dussander threw the cat inside . Its claws made a ripping , prickly sound as they disengaged from the gloves . Dussander slammed the oven door shut with one knee , provoking a painful twinge from his arthritis . Yet he continued to grin . Breathing hard , nearly panting , he propped himself against the stove for a moment , his head hanging down . It was a gas stove . He rarely used it for anything fancier than TV dinners and killing stray cats . Faintly , rising up through the gas burners , he could hear the cat scratching and yowling to be let out . Dussander twisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audible pop ! as the oven pilot-light lit two double rows of hissing gas . The cat stopped yowling and began to scream . It sounded . . . yes . . . almost like a young boy . A young boy in terrible pain . The thought made Dussander smile even more broadly . His heart thundered in his chest . The cat scratched and whirled madly in the oven , still screaming . Soon , a hot , furry , burning smell began to seep out of the oven and into the room . He scraped the remains of the cat out of the oven half an hour later , using a barbecue fork he had acquired for two dollars and ninety-eight cents at the Grant 's in the shopping center a mile away . The cat 's roasted carcass went into an empty flour sack . He took  | the sack down cellar . The cellar floor had never been cemented . Shortly , Dussander came back up . He sprayed the kitchen with Glade until it reeked of artificial pine scent . He opened all the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the pegboard . Then he sat down to wait and see if the boy would come . He smiled and smiled . Todd did come , about five minutes after Dussander had given up on him for the afternoon . He was wearing a warmup jacket with his school colors on it ; he was also wearing a San Diego Padres baseball cap . He carried his schoolbooks under his arm . " Yucka-ducka , " he said , coming into the kitchen and wrinkling his nose . " What 's that smell ? It 's awful . " " I tried the oven , " Dussander said , lighting a cigarette . " I 'm afraid I burned my supper . I had to throw it out . " One day later that month the boy came much earlier than usual , long before school usually let out . Dussander was sitting in the kitchen , drinking Ancient Age bourbon from a chipped and discolored cup that had the words HERE 'S YER CAWFEE MAW , HAW ! HAW ! HAW ! written around the rim . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just drinking and rocking , rocking and drinking , bumping his slippers on the faded linoleum . He was pleasantly high . There had been no more bad dreams at all until just last night . Not since the tomcat with the chewed ears . Last night 's kid been particularly horrible , though . That could not be denied . They had dragged him down after he had gotten halfway up the hill , and they had begun to do unspeakable things to him before he was able to wake himself up . Yet , after his initial thrashing return to the world of real things , he had been confident . He could end the dreams whenever he wished . Perhaps a cat would not be enough this t i : lie But there was always the dog pound . Yes . Always the pound . ' Iudd came abruptly into the kitchen , his face pale and shiny and strained . He had lost weight , all right , Dussander thought . And thrrr was a queer white look in his eyes that Dussander did not like at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Todd said suddenly and defiantly .  | " Really ? " Dussander said mildly , but sudden apprehension leaped inside of him . He did n't let his face change as Todd slammed his books down on the table with a sudden , vicious overhand stroke . One of them spun-skated across the oilcloth and landed in a tent on the floor by Dussander 's foot . " Yes , you 're fucking-A right ! " Todd said shrilly . " You better believe it ! Because this is your fault ! All your fault ! " Hectic spots of red mounted into his cheeks . " But you 're going to have to help me get out of it , because I 've got the goods on you ! I 've got you right where I want you ! " " I 'll help you in any way I can , " Dussander said quietly . He saw that he had folded his hands neatly in front of himself without even thinking about it  --  just as he had once done . He leaned forward in the rocker until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had once done . His face was calm and friendly and enquiring ; none of his growing apprehension showed . Sitting just so , he could almost imagine a pot of lamb stew simmering on the stove behind him . " Tell me what the trouble is . " " This is the fucking trouble , " Todd said viciously , and threw a folder at Dussander . It bounced off his chest and landed in his lap , and he was momentarily surprised by the heat of the anger which leaped up in him ; the urge to rise and backhand the boy smartly . Instead , he kept the mild expression on his face . It was the boy 's school-card , he saw , although the school seemed to be at ridiculous pains to hide the fact . Instead of a school-card , or a Grade Report , it was called a " Quarterly Progress Report . " He grunted at that , and opened the card . A typed half-sheet of paper fell out . Dussander put it aside for later examination and turned his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fallen on the rocks , my boy , " Dussander said , not without some pleasure . The boy had passed only English and American History . Every other grade was an F. " It 's not my fault , " Todd hissed venomously . " It 's your fault . All those stories . I have nightmares about them , do you know that ? I sit down and open my books and I start thinking about whatever you told me that day and the next thing I know , my mother 's telling nle it 's time to go to bed . Well , that 's not my fault ! It is n't ! You heir ... , J le .... ' ot "  | " I hear you very well , " Dussander said , and read the typed note that had been tucked into Todd 's card . Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bowden , This note is to suggest that we have a group conference concerning Todd 's second- and third-quarter grades . In light of Todd 's previous good work in this school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affecting his academic performance in a deleterious way . Such a problem can often be solved by a frank and open discussion . I should point out that although Todd has passed the half-year , his final grades may be failing in some cases unless his work improves radically in the fourth quarter . Failing grades would entail summer school to avoid being kept back and causing a major scheduling problem . I must also note that Todd is in the college division , and that his work so far this year is far below college acceptance levels . It is also below the level of academic ability assumed by the SAT tests . Please be assured that I am ready to work out a mutually convenient time for us to meet . In a case such as this , earlier is usually better . Sincerely yours , Edward French " Who is this Edward French ? " Dussander asked , slipping the note back inside the card ( part of him still marvelled at the American love of jargon ; such a rolling missive to inform the parents that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . His premonition of disaster was stronger than ever , but he refused to give in to it . A year before , he would have done ; a year ago he had been ready for disaster . Now he was not , but it seemed that the cursed boy had brought it to him anyway . " Is he your headmaster ? " " Rubber Ed ? Hell , no . He 's the guidance counsellor . " " Guidance counsellor ? What is that ? " " You can figure it out , " Todd said . He was nearly hysterical . " M .... rpn , l flip nn.l.lom nnrnl " I-lp waltwl ra ni. ly , r , v in , rhr ? rn , , n ,  | shooting sharp , quick glances at Dussander . " Well , I 'm not going to let any of this shit go down . I 'm just not . I 'm not going to any summer school . My dad and mom are going to Hawaii this summer and I 'm going with them . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what my dad will do if he sees that ? " Dussander shook his head . " He 'll get everything out of me . Everything . He 'll know it was you . It could n't be anything else , because nothing else has changed . He 'll poke and pry and he 'll get it all out of me . And then .. . then I 'll . . . I 'll be in dutch . " He stared at Dussander resentfully . " They 'll watch me . Hell , they might make me see a doctor , I do n't know . How should I know ? But I 'm not getting in dutch . And I 'm not going to any fucking summer school . " " Or to the reformatory , " Dussander said . He said it very quietly . Todd stopped circling the room . His face became very still . His cheeks and forehead , already pale , became even whiter . He stared at Dussander , and had to try twice before he could speak . " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , " Dussander said , assuming an air of great patience , " for the last five minutes I have listened to you pule and whine , and what all your puling and whining comes down to is this . You are in trouble . You might be found out . You might find yourself in adverse circumstances . " Seeing that he had the boy 's complete attention  --  at last  --  Dussander sipped reflectively from his cup . " My boy , " he went on , " that is a very dangerous attitude for you to have . And dangerous for me . The potential harm is much greater for me . You worry about your school-card . Pah ! This for your school-card . " He flicked it off the table and onto the floor with one yellow finger . " I am worried about my life ! " Todd did not reply ; he simply went on looking at Dussander with that white-eyed , slightly crazed stare . " The Israelis will not scruple at the fact that I am seventy-six . The death-penalty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | especially when the man in the dock is a Nazi war criminal associated with the camps . " " You 're a U.S. citizen , " Todd said . " America would n't let them take you . I read up on that . I ? " " You read , but you do n't listen ! I am not a U.S. citizen ! My papers came from la coca nostra . I would be deported , and Mossad agents would be waiting for me wherever I deplaned . " " I wish they would hang you , " Todd muttered , curling his hands into fists and staring down at them . " I was crazy to get mixed up with you in the first place . " " No doubt , " Dussander said , and smiled thinly . " But you are mixed up with me . We must live in the present , boy , not in the past of ' I-should-have-nevers . ' You must realize that your fate and my own are now inextricably entwined . If you blow the horn on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will hesitate to blow the horn on you ? Seven hundred thousand died at Patin . To the world at large I am a criminal , a monster , even the butcher your scandal-rags would have me . You are an accessory to all of that , my boy . You have criminal knowledge of an illegal alien , but you have not reported it . And if I am caught , I will tell the world all about you . When the reporters put their microphones in my face , it will be your name I 'll repeat over and over again . ' Todd Bowden , yes , that is his name . . . how long ? Almost a year . He wanted to know everything . . . all the gooshy parts . That 's how he put it , yes : " All the gooshy parts . " ' " Todd 's breath had stopped . His skin appeared transparent . I ) ussander smiled at him . He sipped bourbon . " I think they will put you in jail . They may call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a fancy name for it , like this ' Quarterly Progress Report ' " ? his lip curled ? " but no matter what they call it , there will be bars on the windows . " ' Iudd wet his lips . " I 'd call you a liar . I 'd tell them I just found out . They 'd believe me , not you . You just better remember that . " I ) ussander 's thin smile remained . " I thought you told me your tut her would get it all out of you . " ' Ibdd spoke slowly , as a person speaks when realization and  | verbalization occur simultaneously . " Maybe not . Maybe not this time . This is n't just breaking a window with a rock . " Dussander winced inwardly . He suspected that the boy 's judgment was right  --  with so much at stake , he might indeed be able to convince his father . After all , when faced with such an unpleasant truth , what parent would not want to be convinced ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to explain all those books you had to read to me because poor Mr. Denker is half-blind ? My eyes are not what they were , but I can still read fine print with my spectacles . I can prove it . " " I 'd say you fooled me ! " " Will you ? And what reason will you be able to give for my fooling ? " " For . . . for friendship . Because you were lonely . " That , Dussander reflected , was just close enough to the truth to be believable . And once , in the beginning , the boy might have been able to bring it off . But now he was ragged ; now he was coming apart in strings like a coat that has reached the end of its useful service . If a child shot off his cap pistol across the street , this boy would jump into the air and scream like a girl . " Your school-card will also support my side of it , " Dussander said . " It was not Robinson Crusoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boy , was it ? " " Shut up , why do n't you ? Just shut up about it ! " " No , " Dussander said . " I wo n't shut up about it . " He lit a cigarette , scratching the wooden match alight on the gas oven door . " Not until I make you see the simple truth . We are in this together , sink or swim . " He looked at Todd through the raftering smoke , not smiling , his old , lined face reptilian . " I will drag you down , boy . I promise you that . If anything comes out , everything will come out . That is my promise to you . " Todd stared at him sullenly and did n't reply . " Now , " Dussander said briskly , with the air of a man who has put a necessary unpleasantness behind him , " the question is , what are we going to do about this situation ? Have you any ideas ? " " This will fix the report card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ink eradicator from his jacket pocket . " About that fucking ; letter , I do n't know . "  | Dussander looked at the ink eradicator approvingly . He had falsified a few reports of his own in his time . When the quotas had gone up to the point of fantasy . . . and far , far beyond . And .. . more like the situation they were now in  --  there had been the matter of the invoices .. those which enumerated the spoils of war . Each week he would check the boxes of valuables , all of them to be sent back to Berlin in special train-cars that were like big safes on wheels . On the side of each box was a manila envelope , and inside the envelope there had been a verified invoice of that box 's contents . So many rings , necklaces , chokers , so many grams of gold . Dussander , however , had had his own box of valuables  --  not very valuable valuables , but not insignificant , either . Jades . Tourmalines . Opals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he saw an item invoiced for Berlin that caught his eye or seemed a good investment , he would remove it , replace it with an item from his own box , and use ink eradicator on the invoice , changing their item for his . He had developed into a fairly expert forger .. a talent that had come in handy more than once after t he war was over . " Good , " he told Todd . " As for this other matter ... " Dussander began to rock again , sipping from his cup . Todd pulled a chair up to the table and began to go to work on his report ard , which he had picked up from the floor without a word . I ) ussander 's outward calm had had its effect on him and now he worked silently , his head bent studiously over the card , like any American boy who has set out to do the best by God job he can , whether that job be planting corn , pitching a no-hitter in the Little league World Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the nape of his neck , lightly tanned and cleanly exposed between the fall of his hair and the round neck of his tee-shirt . His eyes drifted from there to the top counter drawer where he kept the butcher knives . One quick thrust ? he knew where to put it  --  and the boy 's spinal cord would be severed . His lips would be sealed forever . Dussander smiled regrethilly . There would be questions asked if the boy disappeared . Too many of them . Some directed at him . Even if there was no letter with a friend , close scrutiny was something he could not afford . ' 1iN )  | " This man French , " he said , tapping the letter . " Does he know your parents in a social way ? " " Him ? " Todd edged the word with contempt . " My mom and dad do n't go anywhere that he could even get in . " " Has he ever met them in his professional capacity ? Has he ever had conferences with them before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of my classes . Until now . " " So what does he know about them ? " Dussander said , looking dreamily into his cup , which was now nearly empty . " Oh , he knows about you . He no doubt has all the records on you that he can use . Back to the fights you had in the kindergarten play yard . But what does he know about them ? " Todd put his pen and the small bottle of ink eradicator away " Well , he knows their names . Of course . And their ages . He knows we 're all Methodists . You do n't have to fill that line out , but my folks always do . We do n't go much , but he 'd know that 's what we are . He must know what my dad does for a living ; that 's on the forms , too . All that stuff they have to fill out every year . And I 'm pretty sure that 's all . " " Would he know if your parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that supposed to mean ? " Dussander tossed off the last of the bourbon in his cup " Squabbles . Fights . Your father sleeping on the couch . Your mother drinking too much . " His eyes gleamed . " A divorce brewing . " Indignantly , Todd said : " There 's nothing like that going on ! No way ! " " I never said there was . But just think , boy . Suppose that things at your house were going to hell in a streetcar , ' as the saying is . " Todd only looked at him , frowning . " You would be worried about them , " Dussander said . " Very worried . You would lose your appetite . You would sleep poorly . Saddest of all , your schoolwork would suffer . True ? Very sad for the children , when there are troubles in the home . " Understanding dawned in the boy 's eyes  --  understanding and something like dumb gratitude . Dussander was gratified . " Yes , it is an unhappy situation when a family totters on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring more bourbon . He was ? ettin ? auite drunk . " The daytime television dramas they  | make this absolutely clear . There is acrimony . Backbiting and lies . Most of all , there is pain . Pain , my boy . You have no idea of the hell your parents are going through . They are so swallowed up by their own troubles that they have little time for the problems of their own son . His problems seem minor compared to theirs , hero ? Someday , when the scars have begun to heal , they will no doubt take a fuller interest in him once again . But now the only concession they can make is to send the boy 's kindly grandfather to Mr. French . " Todd 's eyes had been gradually brightening to a glow that was nearly fervid . " Might work , " he was muttering . " Might , yeah , might work , might ? " He broke off suddenly . His eyes darkened again . " No , it wo n't . You do n't look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never believe it . " " Himmel ! Gott im Himmel ! " Dussander cried , getting to his feet , crossing the kitchen ( a bit unsteadily ) , opening the cellar door , and pulling out a fresh bottle of Ancient Age . He spun off the cap and poured liberally . " For a smart boy , you are such a Dummkopf . When do grandfathers ever look like their grandsons ? Huh ? I got white hair . Do you have white hair ? " Approaching the table again , he reached out with surprising quickness , snatched an abundant handful of Todd 's blonde hair , and pulled briskly . " Cut it out ! " Todd snapped , but he smiled a little . " Besides , " Dussander said , settling back into his rocker , " you have yellow hair and blue eyes . My eyes are blue , and before my hair turned white , it was yellow . You can tell me your whole family history . Your aunts and uncles . The people your father works with . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will study and remember . Two days later it will all be forgotten again  --  these days my memory is like a cloth bag filled with water  --  but I will remember for long enough . " He smiled grimly . " In my time I have stayed ahead of Wiesenthal and pulled the wool over the eyes of Ilitnmler himself . If I can not fool one American public school teacher , I will pull my winding-shroud around me and crawl down into my grave . " " Maybe , " Todd said slowly , and Dussander could see he had already accepted it . His eyes were luminous with relief . No . uire/v ! " Dussander cried .  | He began to cackle with laughter , the rocking chair squeaking back and forth . Todd looked at him , puzzled and a little frightened , but after a bit he began to laugh , too . In Dussander 's kitchen they laughed and laughed , Dussander by the open window where the warm California breeze wafted in , and Todd rocked back on the rear legs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven door , the white enamel of which was crisscrossed by the dark , charred-looking streaks made by Dussander 's wooden matches as he struck them alight . Rubber Ed French ( his nickname , Todd had explained to Dussander , referred to the rubbers he always wore over his sneakers during wet weather ) was a slight man who made an affectation of always wearing Keds to school . It was a touch of informality which he thought would endear him to the one hundred and six children between the ages of twelve and fourteen who made up his counselling load . He had five pairs of Keds , ranging in color from Fast Track Blue to Screaming Yellow Zonkers , totally unaware that behind his back he was known not only as Rubber Ed but as Sneaker Pete and The Ked Man , as in The Ked Man Cometh . He had been known as Pucker in college , and he would have been most humiliated of all to learn that even that shameful fact had somehow gotten out . He rarely wore ties , preferring turtleneck sweaters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when David McCallum had popularized them in The Man from U.N.C.L.E . In his college days his classmates had been known to spy him crossing the quad and remark , " Here comes Pucker in his U.N.C.L.E . sweater . " He had majored in Educational Psychology , and he privately considered himself to be the only good guidance counsellor he had ever met . He had real rapport with his kids . He could get right down to it with them ; he could rap with them and be silently sympathetic if they had to do some shouting and kick out the jams . He could get into their hangups because he understood what a bummer it was to be thirteen when someone was doing a number on your head and you could n't get your shit together . Th ... L : t , h. , , 1 . : .. , 1 i .. , . : .  | had been like to be thirteen himself . He supposed that was the ultimate price you had to pay for growing up in the fifties . That , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pucker . Now , as Todd Bowden 's grandfather came into his office , closing the pebbled-glass door firmly behind him , Rubber Ed stood up respectfully but was careful not to come around his desk to greet the old man . He was aware of his sneakers . Sometimes the old-timers did n't understand that the sneakers were a psychological aid with kids who had teacher hangups  --  which was to say that some of the older folks could n't get behind a guidance counsellor in Keds . This is one fine-looking dude , Rubber Ed thought . His white hair was carefully brushed back . His three-piece suit was spotlessly clean . His dove-gray tie was impeccably knotted . In his left hand he held a furled black umbrella ( outside , a light drizzle had been filling since the weekend ) in a manner that was almost military . A few years ago Rubber Ed and his wife had gone on a Dorothy Sayers jag , reading everything by that estimable lady that they could lay their hands upon . It occurred to him now that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Wimsey at seventy-five , years after both Bunter and Harriet Vane had passed on to their rewards . He made a mental note to tell Sondra about this when he got home . " Mr. Bowden , " he said respectfully , and offered his hand . " A pleasure , " Bowden said , and shook it . Rubber Ed was careful not to put on the firm and uncompromising pressure he applied to the hands of the fathers he saw ; it was obvious from the gingerly way the old boy offered it that he had arthritis . " A pleasure , Mr. French , " Bowden repeated , and took a seat , carefully pulling up the knees of his trousers . He propped the umbrella between his feet and leaned on it , looking like an elderly , extremely urbane vulture that had come in to roost in Rubber Ed French 's office . He had the slightest touch of an accent , Rubber Ed thought , but it was n't the clipped intonation of the British upper t lass , as Wimsey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , the resemblance to Todd was quite striking . Especially through the nose and eyes . " 1 'm glad you could come . " Rubber Ed told him . resuming . his  | own seat , " although in these cases the student 's mother or father ? " This was the opening gambit , of course . Almost ten years of experience in the counselling business had convinced him that when an aunt or an uncle or a grandparent showed up for a conference , it usually meant trouble at home  --  the sort of trouble that invariably turned out to be the root of the problem . To Rubber Ed , this came as a relief . Domestic problems were bad , but for a boy of Todd 's intelligence , a heavy drug trip would have been much , much worse . " Yes , of course , " Bowden said , managing to look both sorrowful and angry at the same time . " My son and his wife asked me if I could come and talk this sorry business over with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . This trouble with his school marks is only temporary . " " Well , we all hope so , do n't we , Mr. Bowden ? Smoke if you like . It 's supposed to be off-limits on school property , but I 'll never tell . " " Thank you . " Mr. Bowden took a half-crushed package of Camel cigarettes from his inner pocket , put one of the last two zig-zagging smokes in his mouth , found a Diamond Blue-Tip match , scratched it on the heel of one black shoe , and lit up . He coughed an old man 's dank cough over the first drag , shook the match out , and put the blackened stump into the ashtray Rubber Ed had produced . Rubber Ed watched this ritual , which seemed almost as formal as the old man 's shoes , with frank fascination . " Where to begin , " Bowden said , his distressed face looking at Rubber Ed through a swirling raft of cigarette smoke . " Well , " Rubber Ed said kindly , " the very fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me something , you know . " " Yes , I suppose it does . Very well . " He folded his hands . The Camel protruded from between the second and third fingers of his right . He straightened his back and lifted his chin . There was something almost Prussian in his mental coming to terms , Rubber Ed thought , something that made him think of all those war movies he 'd seen as a kid . " My son and my daughter-in-law are having troubles in their home , " Bowden said , biting off each word precisely . " Rather had  | troubles , I should think . " His eyes , old but amazingly bright , watched as Rubber Ed opened the folder centered in front of him on the desk blotter . There were sheets of paper inside , but not many . " And you feel that these troubles are affecting Todd 's academic performance ? " Bowden leaned forward perhaps six inches . His blue eyes never left Rubber Ed 's brown ones . There was a heavily charged pause , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He resumed his former ramrod-straight position . " Oh , " Rubber Ed said . " Yes , " Bowden replied , nodding grimly . " The boy has told me that he has come home on two occasions and has found her sprawled out on the kitchen table . He knows how my son feels about her drinking problem , and so the boy has put dinner in the oven himself on these occasions , and has gotten her to drink enough black coffee so she will at least be awake when Richard comes home . " " That 's bad , " Rubber Ed said , although he had heard worse ? mothers with heroin habits , fathers who had abruptly taken it into their heads to start banging their daughters . . . or their sons . " I las Mrs. Bowden thought about getting professional help for her problem ? " " The boy has tried to persuade her that would be the best course . She is much ashamed , I think . If she was given a little time . . . " f lc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke-ring in the air . " You understand ? " " Yes , of course . " Rubber Ed nodded , privately admiring the gesture that had produced the smoke-ring . " Your son . . . Todd 's lather . . . " " lie is not without blame , " Bowden said harshly . " The hours he works , the meals he has missed , the nights when he must leave suddenly . . . I tell you , Mr. French , he is more married to his job than he is to Monica . I was raised to believe that a man 's family game before everything . Was it not the same for you ? " " It sure was , " Rubber Ed responded heartily . His father had been ? night watchman for a large Los Angeles department store and he had really only seen his pop on weekends and vacations.  | " That is another side of the problem , " Bowden said . Rubber Ed nodded and thought for a moment . " What about your other son , Mr. Bowden ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder . " Harold . Todd 's uncle . " " Harry and Deborah are in Minnesota now , " Bowden said , quite truthfully . " He has a position there at the University medical school . It would be quite difficult for him to leave , and very unfair to ask him . " His face took on a righteous cast . " Harry and his wife are quite happily married . " " I see . " Rubber Ed looked at the file again for a moment and then closed it . " Mr. Bowden , I appreciate your frankness . I 'll be just as frank with you . " " Thank you , " Bowden said stiffly . " We ca n't do as much for our students in the counselling area as we would like . There are six counsellors here , and we 're each carrying a load of over a hundred students . My newest colleague , Hepburn , has a hundred and fifteen . At this age , in our society , all children need help . " " Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded his hands once more . " Sometimes bad problems get by us . Home environment and drugs are the two most common . At least Todd is n't mixed up with speed or mescaline or PCP . " " God forbid . " " Sometimes , " Rubber Ed went on , " there 's simply nothing we can do . It 's depressing , but it 's a fact of life . Usually the ones that are first to get spit out of the machine we 're running here are the class troublemakers , the sullen , uncommunicative kids , the ones who refuse to even try . They are simply warm bodies waiting for the system to buck them up through the grades or waiting to get old enough so they can quit without their parents ' permission and join the Army or get a job at the Speedy-Boy Carwash or marry their boyfriends . You understand ? I 'm being blunt . Our system is , as they say , not all it 's cracked up to be . " " I appreciate your frankness . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mash up someone like Todd . He ran out a ninety-two average for last year 's  | work , and that puts him in the ninety-fifth percentile . His English averages are even better . He shows a flair for writing , and that 's something special in a generation of kids that think culture begins in front of the TV and ends in the neighborhood movie theater . I was talking to the woman who had Todd in Comp last year . She said Todd passed in the finest term-paper she 'd seen in twenty years of teaching . It was on the German death-camps during World War Two . She gave him the only A-plus she 's ever given a composition student . " " I have read it , " Bowden said . " It is very fine . " " He has also demonstrated above-average ability in the life sciences and social sciences , and while he 's not going to be one of the great math whizzes of the century , all the notes I have indicate that he 's given it the good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . That 's the whole story , in a nutshell . " " Yes . " " I hate like hell to see Todd go down the tubes this way , Mr. Bowden . And summer school . . . well , I said I 'd be frank . Summer school often does a boy like Todd more harm than good . Your usual junior high school summer session is a zoo . All the monkeys and the laughing hyenas are in attendance , plus a full complement of dodo birds . Bad company for a boy like Todd . " " Certainly . " " So let 's get to the bottom line , shall we ? I suggest a series of appointments for Mr. and Mrs. Bowden at the Counselling Center downtown . Everything in confidence , of course . The man in charge down there , Harry Ackerman , is a good friend of mine . And I do n't think Todd should go to them with the idea ; I think you should . " Rubber Ed smiled widely . " Maybe we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . " But Bowden looked positively alarmed by this idea . " I believe they might resent the boy if I took that proposal to them now , " he said . " Things are very delicate . They could go either way . The boy has promised me he will work harder in his studies . 1 is is very alarmed at this drop in his marks . " He smiled thinly , a smile Ed French could not quite interpret . " More alarmed than you know . "  | " But ? " " And they would resent me , " Bowden pressed on quickly . " God knows they would . Monica already regards me as something of a meddler . I try not to be , but you see the situation . I feel that things are best left alone . . . for now . " " I 've had a great deal of experience in these matters , " Rubber Ed told Bowden . He folded his hands on Todd 's file and looked at the old man earnestly . " I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my interest in the marital problems your son and daughter-in-law are having begins and ends with the effect they 're having on Todd . . . and right now , they 're having quite an effect . " " Let me make a counter-proposal , " Bowden said . " You have , I believe , a system of warning parents of poor grades ? " " Yes , " Rubber Ed agreed cautiously . " Interpretation of Progress cards  --  IOP cards . The kids , of course , call them Flunk Cards . They only get them if their grade in a given course falls below seventy-eight . In other words , we give out IOP cards to kids who are pulling a D or an F in a given course . " " Very good , " Bowden said . " Then what I suggest is this : if the boy gets one of those cards . . . even one " ? he held up one gnarled finger ? " I will approach my son and his wife about your counselling . I will go further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy receives one of your Flunk Cards in April ? " " We give them out in May , actually . " " Yes ? If he receives one then , I guarantee that they will accept the counselling proposal . They are worried about their son , Mr. French . But now they are so wrapped up in their own problem that . . He shrugged . " I understand . " " So let us give them that long to solve their own problems . Pulling one 's self up by one 's own shoelaces . . . that is the American way , is it not ? " " Yes , I guess it is , " Rubber Ed told him after a moment 's thought . . . and after a quick glance at the clock , which told him he had another appointment in five minutes . " I 'll accept that . " He stood , and Bowden stood with him . They shook hands again ,  | Rubber Ed being carefully mindful of the old party 's arthritis . " But in all fairness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pull out of an eighteen-week tailspin in just four weeks of classes . There 's a huge amount of ground to be made up  --  a huge amount . I suspect you 'll have to come through on your guarantee , Mr. Bowden . " Bowden offered his thin , disconcerting smile again . " Do you ? " was all he said . Something had troubled Rubber Ed through the entire interview , and he put his finger on it during lunch in the cafeteria , more than an hour after " Lord Peter " had left , umbrella once again neatly tucked under his arm . He and Todd 's grandfather had talked for fifteen minutes at least , probably closer to twenty , and Ed did n't think the old man had once referred to his grandson by name . Todd pedaled breathlessly up Dussander 's walk and parked his bike on its kickstand . School had let out only fifteen minutes before . He took the front steps at one jump , used his doorkey , and hurried down the hall to the sunlit kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gloomy clouds . He stood in the kitchen doorway for a moment , his stomach and his vocal cords knotted , watching Dussander as he rocked with his cupful of bourbon in his lap . He was still dressed in his best , although he had pulled his tie down two inches and loosened the top button of his shirt . f he . looked at Todd expressionlessly , his lizardlike eyes at halfmast . " Well ? " Todd finally managed . Dussander left him hanging a moment longer , a moment that teemed at least ten years long to Todd . Then , deliberately , Dussander set his cup on the table next to his bottle of Ancient Age and said : " The fool believed everything . " ' Ibdd let out his pentup breath in a whooping gust of relief . Bcfore he could draw another breath in , Dussander added : " He wanted your poor , troubled parents to attend counselling sessions downtown with a friend of his . He was really quite insistent . "  | " Jesus ! Did you . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I thought quickly , " Dussander replied . " Like the little girl in the Saki story , invention on short notice is one of my strong points . I promised him your parents would go in for such counselling if you received even one Flunk Card when they are given in May . " The blood fell out of Todd 's face . " You did what ? " he nearly screamed . " I 've already flunked two algebra quizzes and a history test since the marking period started ! " He advanced into the room , his pale face now growing shiny with breaking sweat . " There was a French quiz this afternoon and I flunked that , too , . I know I did . All I could think about was that goddamned Rubber Ed and whether or not you were taking care of him . You took care of him , all right , " he finished bitterly . " Not get one Flunk Card ? I 'll probably get five or six . " " It was the best I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This French , fool that he is , is only doing his job . Now you will do yours . " " What 's that supposed to mean ? " Todd 's face was ugly and thunderous , his voice truculent . " You will work . In the next four weeks you will work harder than you have ever worked in your life . Furthermore , on Monday you will go to each of your instructors and apologize to them for your poor showing thus far . You will ? " " It 's impossible , " Todd said . " You do n't get it , man . It 's impossible . I 'm at least five weeks behind in science and history . In algebra it 's more like ten . " " Nevertheless , " Dussander said . He poured more bourbon . " You think you 're pretty smart , do n't you ? " Todd shouted at him . " Well , I do n't take orders from you . The days when you gave orders are long over . Do you get it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethal thing you 've got around the house these days is a Shell No-Pest Strip . You 're nothing but a broken-down old nun who farts rotten eggs if he eats a taco . I bet you even pee in your bed . " " Listen to me , snotnose , " Dussander said quietly . Todd 's head jerked angrily around at that . " Before today , " Dussander said carefully , " it was possible , flu  | barely possible , that you could have denounced me and come out clean yourself . I do n't believe you would have been up to the job with your nerves in their present state , but never mind that . It would have been technically possible . But now things have changed . Today I impersonated your grandfather , one Victor Bowden . No one can have the slightest doubt that I did it with . how is the word ? ... your connivance . If it comes out now , boy , you will look blacker than ever . And you will have no defense . I took care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You wish ! You wish ! " Dussander roared . " Never mind your wishes , your wishes make me sick , your wishes are no more than little piles of dogshit in the gutter ! All I want from you is to know if you understand the situation we are in ! " " I understand it , " Todd muttered . His fists had been tightly clenched while Dussander shouted at him  --  he was not used to being shouted at . Now he opened his hands and dully observed that he had dug bleeding half-moons into his palms . The cuts would have been worse , he supposed , but in the last four months or so he had taken up biting his nails . " Good . Then you will make your sweet apologies , and you will study . In your free time at school you will study . During your lunch hours you will study . After school you will come here and study , and on your weekends you will come here and do more of the same . " " Not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . At home you will dawdle and daydream as you have all along . If you are here I can stand over you if I have to and watch you . I can protect my own interests in this matter . I can quiz you . I can listen to your lessons . " " If I do n't want to come here , you ca n't make me . " Dussander drank . " That is true . Things will then go on as they have . You will fail . This guidance person , French , will expect me to make good on my promise . When I do n't , he will call your parents . They will find out that kindly Mr. Denker impersonated your grandfather at your request . They will find out about the altered grades . They ? " " Oh , shut up . I 'll come . "  | " You 're already here . Begin with algebra . " " No way ! It 's Friday afternoon ! " " You study every afternoon now , " Dussander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at him  --  only for a moment before dropping his eyes and fumbling his algebra text out of his bookbag  --  and Dussander saw murder in the boy 's eyes . Not figurative murder ; literal murder . It had been years since he had seen that dark , burning , speculative glance , but one never forgot it . He supposed he would have seen it in his own eyes if there had been a mirror at hand on the day he had looked at the white and defenseless nape of the boy 's neck . I must protect myself , he thought with some amazement . One underestimates at one 's own risk . He drank his bourbon and rocked and watched the boy study . It was nearly five o'clock when Todd biked home . He felt washed out , hot-eyed , drained , impotently angry . Every time his eyes had wandered from the printed page  --  from the maddening , incomprehensible , fucking stupid world of sets , subsets , ordered pairs , and Cartesian co-ordinates  --  Dussander 's sharp old man 's voice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . except for the maddening bump of his slippers on the floor and the squeak of the rocker . He sat there like a vulture waiting for its prey to expire . Why had he ever gotten into this ? How had he gotten into it ? This was a mess , a terrible mess . He had picked up some ground this afternoon  --  some of the set theory that had stumped him so badly just before the Christmas break had fallen into place with an almost audible click  --  but it was impossible to think he could pick up enough to scrape through next week 's algebra test with even a D. It was four weeks until the end of the world . On the corner he saw a bluejay lying on the sidewalk , its beak slowly opening and closing . It was trying vainly to get onto its birdy-feet and hop away . One of its wings had been crushed , and Todd supposed a passing car had hit it and flipped it up onto the sidewalk like a tiddlywink One of its beady eyes stared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , holding the grips of his bike 's  | apehanger handlebars lightly . Some of the warmth had gone out of the day and the air felt almost chilly . He supposed his friends had spent the afternoon goofing off down at the Babe Ruth diamond on Walnut Street , maybe playing a little scrub , more likely playing pepper or **25;1286;TOOLONG or rolly-bat . It was the time of year when you started working your way up to baseball . There was some talk about getting up their own sandlot team this year to compete in the informal city league ; there were dads enough willing to shlepp them around to games . Todd , of course , would pitch . He had been a Little League pitching star until he had grown out of the Senior Little League division last year . Would have pitched . So what ? He 'd just have to tell them no . He 'd just have to tell them : Guys , I got mixed up with this war criminal . I got him right by the balls , and then  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out he was holding my balls as tight as I was holding his . I started having funny dreams and the cold sweats . My grades went to hell and I changed them on my report card so my folks would n't find out and now I 've got to hit the books really hard for the first time in my lift . I 'm not afraid of getting grounded , though . I 'm afraid of going to the reformatory . And that 's why I ca n't play any sandlot with you guys this year . You see how it is , guys . A thin smile , much like Dussander 's and not at all like his former broad grin , touched his lips . There was no sunshine in it ; it was a shady smile . There was no fun in it ; no confidence . It merely said : You see how it is , guys . He rolled his bike forward over the jay with exquisite slowness , hearing the newspaper crackle of its feathers and the crunch of its small hollow bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it again . It was still twitching . He rolled over it again , a single bloody feather stuck to his front tire , revolving up and down , up and down . By then the bird had stopped moving , the bird had kicked the bucket , the bird had punched out , the bird had gone to that great aviary in the sky , but Todd kept going forwards and backwards across its mashed body just the same . He did it for almost five minutes , and that thin smile never left his face . You see how it is , guys .  | 10 April , 1975 . The old man stood halfway down the compound 's aisle , smiling broadly , as Dave Klingerman walked up to meet him . The frenzied barking that filled the air did n't seem to bother him in the slightest , or the smells of fur and urine , or the hundred different strays yapping and howling in their cages , dashing back and forth , leaping against the mesh . Klingerman pegged the old guy as a dog-lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant . He offered Dave a swollen , arthritis-bunched hand carefully , and Klingerman shook it in the same spirit . " Hello , sir ! " he said , speaking up . " Noisy as hell , is n't it ? " " I do n't mind , " the old man said . " Not at all . My name is Arthur Denker . " " Klingerman . Dave Klingerman . " " I am pleased to meet you , sir . I read in the paper  --  I could not believe it  --  that you give dogs away here . Perhaps I misunderstood . In fact I think I must have misunderstood . " " No , we give em away , all right , " Dave said . " If we ca n't , we have to destroy em . Sixty days , that 's what the State gives us . Shame . Come on in the office here . Quieter . Smells better , too . In the office , Dave heard a story that was familiar ( but nonetheless affecting ) : Arthur Denker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife died . He was not rich , but he tended what he did have with great care . He was lonely . His only friend was the boy who sometimes came to his house and read to him . In Germany he had owned a beautiful Saint Bernard . Now , in Santo Donato , he had a house with a good-sized back yard . The yard was fenced . And he had read in the paper . . . would it be possible that he could .. " Well , we do n't have any Bernards , " Dave said . " They go fast because they 're so good with kids ? " " Oh , I understand . I did n't mean that ? " " ? but I do have a half-grown shepherd pup . How would that be ? "  | Mr. Denker 's eyes grew bright , as if he might be on the verge of tears . " Perfect , " he said . " That would be perfect . " " The dog itself is free , but there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city dog licence . All of it goes about twenty-five bucks for most people , but the State pays half if you 're over sixty-five  --  part of the California Golden Ager program . " " Golden Ager . . . is that what I am ? " Mr. Denker said , and laughed . For just a moment  --  it was silly  --  Dave felt a kind of chill . " Uh . . . I guess so , sir . " " It is very reasonable . " " Sure , we think so . The same dog would cost you a hundred and twenty-five dollars in a pet shop . But people go to those places instead of here . They are paying for a set of papers , of course , not the dog . " Dave shook his head . " If they only understood how many tine animals are abandoned every year . " " And if you ca n't find a suitable home for them within sixty days , they are destroyed ? " " We put them to sleep , yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , my English ? " " It 's a city ordinance , " Dave said . " Ca n't have dog-packs running the streets . " " You shoot them . " " No , we give them gas . It 's very humane . They do n't feel a thing . " " No , " Mr. Denker said . " I am sure they do n't . " Todd 's seat in Beginning Algebra was four desks down in the to c and row . He sat there , trying to keep his face expressionless , as M r . Storrman passed back the exams . But his ragged fingernails were digging into his palms again , and his entire body seemed to be running with a slow and caustic sweat . Do n't get your hopes up . Do n't be such a goddam chump . There 's no way you could have passed . You know you did n't pass . Nevertheless , he could not completely squash the foolish hope . It had been the first algebra exam in weeks that looked as if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure that in his  | nervousness ( nervousness ? no , call it what it had really been : outright terror ) he had not done that well , but maybe . . . well , if it had been anyone else but Storrman , who had a Yale padlock for a heart . . . STOP IT ! he commanded himself , and for a moment , a coldly horrible moment , he was positive he had screamed those two words aloud in the classroom . You flunked , you know you did , not a thing in the world is going to change it . Storrman handed him his paper expressionlessly and moved on . Todd laid it face down on his initial-scarred desk . For a moment he did n't think he possessed sufficient will to even turn it over and know . At last he flipped it with such convulsive suddenness that the exam sheet tore . His tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth as he stared at it . His heart seemed to stop for a moment . The number 83 was written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below it was a letter-grade : C+ . Below the letter-grade was a brief notation : Good improvement ! I think I 'm twice as relieved as you should be . Check errors carefully . At least three of them are arithmetical rather than conceptual . His heartbeat began again , at triple-time . Relief washed over him , but it was not cool  --  it was hot and complicated and strange . He closed his eyes , not hearing the class as it buzzed over the exam and began the pre-ordained fight for an extra point here or there . Todd saw redness behind his eyes . It pulsed like flowing blood with the rhythm of his heartbeat . In that instant he hated Dussander more than he ever had before . His hands snapped shut into fists and he only wished , wished , wished , that Dussander 's scrawny chicken neck could have been between them . Dick and Monica Bowden had twin beds , separated by a nightstand with a pretty imitation Tiffany lamp standing on it . Their room was done in genuine redwood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , nestled between two ivory bookends ( bull elephants on their hind legs ) was a round Sony TV . Dick was watching Johnny Carson with the earplug In while Monica read the new Michael Crichton that had come from the book club that day .  | " Dick ? " She put a bookmark ( THIS IS WHERE I FELL ASLEEP , it said ) into the Crichton and closed it . On the TV , Buddy Hackett had just broken everyone up . Dick smiled . " Dick ? " she said more loudly . He pulled the earplug out . " What ? " " Do you think Todd 's all right ? " He looked at her for a moment , frowning , then shook his head a little . je ne comprends pas , cherie . " His limping French was a joke between them . His father had sent him an extra two hundred dollars to hire a tutor when he was flunking French . He had gotten Monica Darrow , picking her name at random from the cards tacked up on the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin . . . and he had managed a C in French . " Well . . . he 's lost weight . " " He looks a little scrawny , sure , " Dick said . He put the TV earplug in his lap , where it emitted tiny squawking sounds . " He 's growing up , Monica . " " So soon ? " she asked uneasily . He laughed . " So soon . I shot up seven inches as a teenager - from a five-foot-six shrimp at twelve to the beautiful six-foot-one mass of muscle you see before you today . My mother said that when I was fourteen you could hear me growing in the night . " " Good thing not all of you grew that much . " " It 's all in how you use it . " " Want to use it tonight ? " " The wench grows bold , " Dick Bowden said , and threw the earplug across the room . After , as he was drifting off to sleep : " I ) ick , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he muttered . " Nightmares . I 've heard him moaning in his sleep two or three times when I 've gone down to use the bathroom in the night . I did n't want to wake him up . It 's silly , but my grandmother used to ' ay you could drive a person insane if you woke them up in the middle of a bad dream . "  | " She was the Polack , was n't she ? " " The Polack , yeah , the Polack . Nice talk ! " " You know what I mean . Why do n't you just use the upstairs john ? " He had put it in himself two years ago . " You know the flush always wakes you up , " she said . " So do n't flush it . " " Dick , that 's nasty . " He sighed . " Sometimes when I go in , he 's sweating . And the sheets are damp . " He grinned in the dark . " I bet . " " What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's nasty , too . Besides , he 's only thirteen . " " Fourteen next month . He 's not too young . A little precocious , maybe , but not too young . " " How old were you ? " " Fourteen or fifteen . I do n't remember exactly . But I remember I woke up thinking I 'd died and gone to heaven . " " But you were older than Todd is now . " " All that stuff 's happening younger . It must be the milk . . . or the fluoride . Do you know they have sanitary napkin dispensers in all the girls ' rooms of the school we built in Jackson Park last year ? And that 's a grammar school . Now your average sixth-grader is only eleven . How old were you when you started ? " " I do n't remember , " she said . " All I know is Todd 's dreams do n't sound like . . . like he died and went to heaven . " " Have you asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago . You were off playing golf with that horrible Ernie Jacobs . " " That horrible Ernie Jacobs is going to make me a full partner l ) y 1977 , if he does n't screw himself to death with that high-yellow secretary of his before then . Besides , he always pays the greens tees . What did Todd say ? " " That he did n't remember . But a sort of ... shadow crossed his face . I think he did remember . " " Monica , I do n't remember everything from my dear dead youth , but one thing I do remember is that wet dreams are not alwa pleasant . In fact , they can be downright unpleasant . "  | " How can that be ? " " Guilt . All kinds of guilt . Some of it maybe all the way from babyhood , when it was made very clear to him that wetting the bed was wrong . Then there 's the sex thing . Who knows what brings a wet dream on ? Copping a feel on the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do n't know . The only one I can really remember was going off the high board at the YMCA pool on co-ed day and losing my trunks when I hit the water . " " You got off on that ? " she asked , giggling a little . " Yeah . So if the kid does n't want to talk to you about his John Thomas problems , do n't force him . " " We did our damn best to raise him without all those needless guilts . " " You ca n't escape them . He brings them home from school like the colds he used to pick up in the first grade . From his friends , or the way his teachers mince around certain subjects . He probably got it from my dad , too . ' Do n't touch it in the night , Todd , or your hands 'll grow hair and you 'll go blind and you 'll start to lose your memory , and after awhile your thing will turn black and rot off . So be careful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never ? " " He would n't ? Hell , he did . Just like your Polack grandmother told you that waking somebody up in the middle of a nightmare might drive them nuts . He also told me to always wipe off the ring of a public toilet before I sat on it so I would n't get ' other people 's germs . ' I guess that was his way of saying syphilis . I bet your grandmother laid that one on you , too . " " No , my mother , " she said absently . " And she told me to always flush . Which is why I go downstairs . " " It still wakes me up , " Dick mumbled . " What ? " " Nothing . " This time he had actually drifted halfway over the threshold of sleep when she spoke his name again . " What ? " he asked , a little impatiently . You do n't suppose . . . oh , never mind . Go back to sleep . " " No , go on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose what ? " " That old man . Mr. Denker . You do n't think Todd 's seeing too  | much of him , do you ? Maybe he 's . . . oh , I do n't know . . filling Todd up with a lot of stories . " " The real heavy horrors , " Dick said . " The day the Essen Motor Works dropped below quota . " He snickered . " It was just an idea , " she said , a little stiffly . The covers rustled as she turned over on her side . " Sorry I bothered you . " He put a hand on her bare shoulder . " I 'll tell you something , babe , " he said , and stopped for a moment , thinking carefully , choosing his words . " I 've been worried about Todd , too , sometimes . Not the same things you 've been worried about , but worried is worried , right ? " She turned back to him . " About what ? " " Well , I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dad had the store . Vic the Grocer , everyone called him . He had a book where he kept the names of the people who owed him , and how much they owed . You know what he called it ? " " No . " Dick rarely talked about his boyhood ; she had always thought it was because he had n't enjoyed it . She listened carefully now . " He called it the Left Hand Book . He said the right hand was business , but the right hand should never know what the left hand was doing . He said if the right hand did know , it would probably grab a meat-cleaver and chop the left hand right off . " " You never told me that . " " Well , I did n't like the old man very much when we first got married , and the truth is I still spend a lot of time not liking him . I could n't understand why I had to wear pants from the Goodwill box while Mrs. Mazursky could get a ham on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going back to work next week . The only work that fucking wino Bill Mazursky ever had was holding onto a twelve-cent bottle of musky so it would n't fly away . " All I ever wanted in those days was to get out of the neighborhood and away from my old man 's life . So I made grades and played sports I did n't really like and got a scholarship at UCLA . And I made damn sure I stayed in the top ten per cent of my classes because the only Left Hand Book the colleges kept in those days was for the GIs that fought the war . My dad sent me money for my  | textbooks , but the only other money I ever took from him was the time I wrote home in a panic because I was flunking funnybook French . I met you . And I found out later from Mr. Halleck down the block that my dad put a lien on his car to scare up that two hundred bucks . " And now I 've got you , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damned fine boy , and I 've tried to make sure he 's always had everything he ever needed . . . anything that would help him grow into a fine man . I used to laugh at that old wheeze about a man wanting his son to be better than he was , but as I get older it seems less funny and more true . I never want Todd to have to wear pants from a Goodwill box because some wino 's wife got a ham on credit . You understand ? " " Yes , of course I do , " she said quietly . " Then , about ten years ago , just before my old man finally got tired of fighting off the urban renewal guys and retired , he had a minor stroke . He was in the hospital for ten days . And the people from the neighborhood , the guineas and the krauts , even some of the jigs that started to move in around 1955 or so . . . they paid his bill . Every fucking cent . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Fiona Castellano got four or five of her friends who were out of work to come in on shifts . When my old man got back , the books balanced out to the cent . " " Wow , " she said , very softly . " You know what he said to me ? My old man ? That he 'd always been afraid of getting old  --  of being scared and hurting and all by himself . Of having to go into the hospital and not being able to make ends meet anymore . Of dying . He said that after the stroke he was n't scared anymore . He said he thought he could die well . You mean die happy , Pap ? ' I asked him . ' No , ' he said . ' I do n't think anyone dies happy , Dickie . ' He always called me Dickie , still does , and that 's another thing I guess I 'll never be able to like . He said he did n't think anyone died happy , but you could die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long , thoughtful time . " The last five or six years I 've been able to get some perspective on my old man . Maybe because he 's down there in San Remo and  | out of my hair . I started thinking that maybe the Left Hand Book was n't such a bad idea . That was when I started to worry about Todd . I kept wanting to tell him about how there was maybe something more to life than me being able to take all of you to Hawaii for a month or being able to buy Todd pants that do n't smell like the mothballs they used to put in the Goodwill box . I could never figure out how to tell him those things . But I think maybe he knows . And it takes a load off my mind . " " Reading to Mr. Denker , you mean ? " " Yes . He 's not getting anything for that . Denker ca n't pay him . Here 's this old guy , thousands of miles from any friends or relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's everything my father was afraid of . And there 's Todd . " " I never thought of it just like that . " " Have you noticed the way Todd gets when you talk to him about that old man ? " " He gets very quiet . " " Sure . He gets tongue-tied and embarrassed , like he was doing something nasty . Just like my pop used to when someone tried to thank him for laying some credit on them . We 're Todd 's right hand , that 's all . You and me and all the rest  --  the house , the ski-trips to Tahoe , the Thunderbird in the garage , his color TV . All his right hand . And he does n't want us to see what his left hand is up to . " You do n't think he 's seeing too much of Denker , then ? " " Honey , look at his grades ! If they were falling off , I 'd be the first one to say Hey , enough is enough , already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place trouble would show up . And how have tl icy been ? " " As good as ever , after that first slip . " " So what are we talking about ? Listen , I 've got a conference at nine , babe . If I do n't get some sleep , I 'm going to be sloppy . " " Sure , go to sleep , " she said indulgently , and as he turned over , she kissed him lightly on one shoulderblade . " I love you . " " Love you too , " he said comfortably , and closed his ey " Everything 's fine , Monica . You worry too much . " " I know I do . Goodnight . " They slept .  | " " Stop looking out the window , " Dussander said . " There is nothing out there to interest you . " Todd looked at him sullenly . His history text was open on the table , showing a color plate of Teddy Roosevelt cresting San Juan Hill . Helpless Cubans were falling away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide American grin , the grin of a man who knew that God was in His heaven and everything was bully . Todd Bowden was not grinning . " You like being a slave-driver , do n't you ? " he asked . " I like being a free man , " Dussander said . " Study . " " Suck my cock . " " As a boy , " Dussander said , " I would have had my mouth washed out with lye soap for saying such a thing . " " Times change . " " Do they ? " Dussander sipped his bourbon . " Study . " Todd stared at Dussander . " You 're nothing but a goddamned rummy . You know that ? " " Study . " " Shut up ! " Todd slammed his book shut . It made a riflecrack sound in Dussander 's kitchen . " I can never catch up , anyway . Not in time for the test . There 's fifty pages of this shit left , all the way up to World War One . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Harshly , Dussander said : " You will do no such thing ! " " Why not ? Who 's going to stop me ? You ? " " Boy , you are still having a hard time comprehending the stakes we play for . Do you think I enjoy keeping your snivelling brat nose in your books ? " His voice rose , whipsawing , demanding , commanding . " Do you think I enjoy listening to your tantrums , your kindergarten swears ? ' Suck my cock , ' " Dussander mimicked savagely in a high , falsetto voice that made Todd flush darkly . " ' Suck my cock , so what , who cares , I 'll do it tomorrow , suck my cock ' ! " " Well , you like it ! " Todd shouted back . " Yeah , you like it ! The only time you do n't feel like a zombie is when you 're on my back ! So give me a fucking break ! "  | " If you are caught with one of these cribbing papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told first ? " Todd looked at his hands with their ragged , bitten fingernails and said nothing . " Who ? " " Jesus , you know . Rubber Ed . Then my folks , I guess . " Dussander nodded . " Me , I guess that too . Study . Put your cribbing paper in your head , where it belongs . " " I hate you , " Todd said dully . " I really do . " But he opened his book again and Teddy Roosevelt grinned up at him , Teddy galloping into the twentieth century with his saber in his hand , Cubans falling back in disarray before him  --  possibly before the force of his fierce American grin . Dussander began to rock again . He held his teacup of bourbon in his hands . " That 's a good boy , " he said , almost tenderly . Todd had his first wet dream on the last night of April , and he awoke to the sound of rain whispering secretly through the leaves and branches of the tree outside his window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Patin laboratories . He was standing at the end of a long , low table . A lush young girl of amazing beauty had been secured to this table with clamps . Dussander was assisting him . Dussander wore a white butcher 's apron and nothing else . When he pivoted to turn on the monitoring equipment , Todd could see Dussander 's scrawny buttocks grinding at each other like misshapen white stones . He handed something to Todd , something he recognized immediately , although he had never actually seen one . It was a dildo . The tip of it was polished metal , winking in the light of the overhead fluorescents like heartless chrome . The dildo was hollow . Snaking out of it was a black electrical cord that ended in a red rubber bulb . " Go ahead , " Dussander said . " The Fuehrer says it 's all right . 1 le says it 's your reward for studying . " Todd looked down at himself and saw that he was naked . Ilis small penis was fully erect , jutting plumply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pubic hair . He slipped the dildo on . The fit was tight but there was some sort of lubricant in there . The friction was pleasant . No ; it was more than pleasant . It was delightful .  | He looked down at the girl and felt a strange shift in his thoughts . . . as if they had slipped into a perfect groove . Suddenly all things seemed right . Doors had been opened . He would goI through them . He took the red rubber bulb in his left hand , put his knees on the table , and paused for just a moment , gauging the angle while his Norseman 's prick made its own angle up and out from his slight boy 's body . Dimly , far off , he could hear Dussander reciting : " Test run eighty-four . Electricity , sexual stimulus , metabolism . Based on the Thyssen theories of negative reinforcement . Subject is a young Jewish girl , approximately sixteen years of age , no scars , no identifying marks , no known disabilities ? " She cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd found the cry pleasant , as he did her fruitless struggles to free herself , or , lacking that , to at least bring her legs together . This is what they ca n't show in those magazines about the war , he thought , but it 's there , just the same . He thrust forward suddenly , parting her with no grace . She shrieked like a firebell . After her initial thrashings and efforts to expel him , she lay perfectly still , enduring . The lubricated interior of the dildo pulled and slid against Todd 's engorgement . Delightful . Heavenly . His fingers toyed with the rubber bulb in his left hand . Far away , Dussander recited pulse , blood pressure , respiration , alpha waves , beta waves , stroke count . As the climax began to build inside him , Todd became perfectly still and squeezed the bulb . Her eyes , which had been closed , flew open , bulging . Her tongue fluttered in the pink cavity of her mouth . Her arms and legs thrummed . But the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrating , every muscle ( oh every muscle every muscle moves tightens closes every ) every muscle and the sensation at climax was ( ecstasy ) oh it was , it was ( the end of the world thundering outside ) lie woke to that sound and the sound of rain . He was huddled on his side in a dark ball , his heart beating at a sprinter 's pace . His  | lower belly was covered with a warm , sticky liquid . There was an instant of panicky horror when he feared he might be bleeding to death . . . and then he realized what it really was , and he felt a fainting , nauseated revulsion . Semen . Come . Jizz . Jungle-juice . Words from fences and locker rooms and the walls of gas station bathrooms . There was nothing here he wanted . His hands balled helplessly into fists . His dream-climax recurred to him , pallid now , senseless , frightening . But nerve-endings still tingled , retreating slowly from their spike-point . That final scene , fading now , was disgusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of tropical fruit which , you realized ( a second too late ) , had only tasted so amazingly sweet because it was rotten . It came to him then . What he would have to do . There was only one way he could get himself back again . He would have to kill Dussander . It was the only way . Games were done ; storytime was over . This was survival . " Kill him and it 's all over , " he whispered in the darkness , with the rain in the tree outside and semen drying on his belly . Whispering it made it seem real . Dussander always kept three or four fifths of Ancient Age on a shelf over the steep cellar stairs . He would go to the door , open it ( half-crocked already , more often than not ) , and go down two steps . Then he would lean out , put one hand on the shelf , and grip the fresh bottle by the neck with his other hand . The cellar floor was not paved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinelike efficiency that Todd now thought of as Prussian rather than German , oiled it once every two months to keep bugs from breeding in the dirt . Cement or no cement , old bones break easily . And old men have accidents . The post-mortem would show that " Mr. Denker " had had a skinful of booze when he " fell . " What happened , Todd ? He did n't answer the door so I used the key he gave me . Sometimes hi falls asleep . I went into the kitchen and saw the cellar door was open . I u rwI down the stairs and he ... he . . . Then , of course , tears . It would work .  | He would have himself back again . For a long time Todd lay awake in the dark , listening to the thunder retreat westward , out over the Pacific , listening to the secret sound of the rain . He thought he would stay awake the rest of the night , going over it and over it . But he fell asleep only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin . He woke on the first of May fully rested for the first time in months . 11 May , 1975 . For Todd , that Friday was the longest of his life . He sat in class after class , hearing nothing , waiting only for the last five minutes , when the instructor would take out his or her small pile of Flunk Cards and distribute them . Each time an instructor approached Todd 's desk with that pile of cards , he grew cold . Each time he or she passed him without stopping , he felt waves of dizziness and semi-hysteria . Algebra was the worst . Storrman approached . . . hesitated .. . and just as Todd became convinced he was going to pass on , he laid a Flunk Card face down on Todd 's desk . Todd looked at it coldly , with no feelings at all . Now that it had happened , he was only cold . Well , that 's it , he thought . Point , game , set , and match . Unless Du sander can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without much interest , he turned the Flunk Card over to see by how much he had missed his C. It must have been close , but trust olkl Stony Storrman not to give anyone a break . He saw that the grade-spaces were utterly blank  --  both the letter-grade space and the numerical-grade space . Written in the COMMENTS section was this message : I 'm sure glad I do n't have to give you one of these for REAL ! G/his . Storrman . The dizziness came again , more savagely this time , roaring through his head , making it feel like a balloon filled with helium . I k gripped the sides of his desk as hard as he could , holding one thought with total obsessive tightness : You will not faint , not faint , Not faint . Little by little the waves of dizziness passed , and then he had to control an urge to run up the aisle after Storrman , turn him  | around , and poke his eyes out with the freshly sharpened pencil he held in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only sign that anything at all was going on inside was a mild tic in one eyelid . School let out for the week fifteen minutes later . Todd walked slowly around the building to the bike-racks , his head down , his hands shoved into his pockets , his books tucked into the crook of his right arm , oblivious of the running , shouting students . He tossed the books into his bike-basket , unlocked the Schwinn , and pedaled away . Toward Dussander 's house . Today , he thought . Today is your day , old man . " And so , " Dussander said , pouring bourbon into his cup as Todd entered the kitchen , " the accused returns from the dock . How said they , prisoner ? " He was wearing his bathrobe and a pair of hairy wool socks that climbed halfway up his shins . Socks like that , Todd thought , would be easy to slip in . He glanced at the bottle of Ancient Age Dussander was currently working . It was down to the last three fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Flunk Cards , " Todd said . " I 'll still have to change some of my grades in June , but maybe just the averages . I 'll be getting all A 's and B 's this quarter if I keep up my work . " " Oh , you 'll keep it up , all right , " Dussander said . " We will see to it . " He drank and then tipped more bourbon into his cup . " This calls for a celebration . " His speech was slightly blurred  --  hardly enough to be noticeable , but Todd knew the old fuck was as drunk as he ever got . Yes , today . It would have to be today . But he was cool . " Celebrate pigshit , " he told Dussander . " I 'm afraid the delivery boy has n't arrived with the beluga and the truffles yet , " Dussander said , ignoring him . " Help is so unreliable these days . What about a few Ritz crackers and some Velveeta while we wait ? " " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dussander stood up ( one knee banged the table , making hint wince ) and crossed to the refrigerator . He got out the cheese , took a knife from the drawer and a plate from the cupboard , and a box Ritz crackers from the breadbox.  | " All carefully injected with prussic acid , " he told Todd as he set the cheese and crackers down on the table . He grinned , and Todd saw that he had left out his false teeth again today . Nevertheless , Todd smiled back . " So quiet today ! " Dussander exclaimed . " I would have expected you to turn handsprings all the way up the hall . " He emptied the last of the bourbon into his cup , sipped , smacked his lips . " I guess I 'm still numb , " Todd said . He bit into a cracker . He had stopped refusing Dussander 's food a long time ago . Dussander thought there was a letter with one of Todd 's friends  --  there was not , of course ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed Dussander had guessed that long ago , but he knew Iussander did n't quite dare put his guess to such an extreme test as murder . " What shall we talk about today ? " Dussander enquired , tossing off the last shot . " I give you the day off from studying , how 's that ? lJh ? Uh ? " When he drank , his accent became thicker . It was an accent Todd had come to hate . Now he felt okay about the accent ; he felt okay about everything . He felt very cool all over . He looked at his hands , the hands which would give the push , and they looked just as they always did . They were not trembling ; they were cool . " I do n't care , " he said . " Anything you want . " " Shall I tell you about the special soap we made ? Our experiments with enforced homosexuality ? Or perhaps you would like to hear how I escaped Berlin after I had been foolish enough to go back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He pantomimed shaving one stubbly cheek and laughed . " Anything , " Todd said . " Really . " He watched Dussander examine the empty bottle and then get up with it in one hand . 1 ) tissander took it to the wastebasket and dropped it in . No , none of those , I think , " Dussander said . " You do n't seem to 1 in the mood . " He stood reflectively by the wastebasket for a moment and then crossed the kitchen to the cellar door . His wool ux ks whispered on the hilly linoleum . " I think today I will instead tell you the story of an old man who was afraid . " Iussander opened the cellar door . His back was now to the table . ' I ; kLi etncui utl ciuit  --  tly  | " He was afraid , " Dussander went on , " of a certain young boy who was , in a queer way , his friend . A smart boy . His mother called this boy ' apt pupil , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt pupil . . . although perhaps not in the way his mother thought . " Dussander fumbled with the old-fashioned electrical switch on the wall , trying to turn it with his bunched and clumsy fingers . Todd walked  --  almost glided  --  across the linoleum , not stepping on any of the places where it squeaked or creaked . He knew this kitchen as well as his own , now . Maybe better . " At first , the boy was not the old man 's friend , " Dussander said . He managed to turn the switch at last . He descended the first step with a veteran drunk 's care . " At first the old man disliked the boy a great deal . Then he grew to . . . to enjoy his company , although there was still a strong element of dislike there . " He was looking at the shelf now but still holding the railing . Todd , cool  --  no , now he was cold  --  stepped behind him and calculated the chances of one strong push dislodging Dussander 's hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned forward . " Part of the old man 's enjoyment came from a feeling of equality , " Dussander went on thoughtfully . " You see , the boy and the old man had each other in mutual deathgrips . Each knew something the other wanted kept secret . And then . . . ah , then it became apparent to the old man that things were changing . Yes . I is was losing his hold  --  some of it or all of it , depending on how desperate the boy might be , and how clever . It occurred to this old man on one long and sleepless night that it might be well for him to acquire a new hold on the boy . For his own safety . " Now Dussander let go of the railing and leaned out over the steep cellar stairs , but Todd remained perfectly still . The bone-deep t old was melting out of him , being replaced by a rosy flush of anger and confusion . As Dussander grasped his fresh bottle , Todd thought viciously that the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . It smelled as if something had died down there . " So the old man got out of his bed right then . What is sleep to an old man ? Very little . And he sat at his small desk , thinking about how cleverly he had enmeshed the boy in the very crimes the boy vr ? , c v..in . u , .. r hic .. rr , r . I-I. , ens . -. : r. l. : 1 - L .. -1 . L  | boy had worked , how very hard , to bring his school marks back up . And how , when they were back up , he would have no further need for the old man alive . And if the old man were dead , the boy could be free . " He turned around now , holding the fresh bottle of Ancient Age by the neck . " I heard you , you know , " he said , almost gently . " From the moment you pushed your chair back and stood up . You are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet . " Todd said nothing . " So ! " Dussander exclaimed , stepping back into the kitchen and closing the cellar door firmly behind him . " The old man wrote everything down , nicht wahr ? From first word to last he wrote it down . When he was finally finished it was almost dawn and his hand was singing from the arthritis  --  the verdammt arthritis ? but he felt good for the first times in weeks . He felt safe . He got back into his bed and slept until mid-afternoon . In fact , if he had slept any longer , he would have missed his favorite  --  General Hospital . " He had regained his rocker now . He sat down , produced a worn jackknife with a yellow ivory handle , and began to cut painstaking .. ly around the seal covering the top of the bourbon bottle . " On the following day the old man dressed in his best suit and went down to the bank where he kept his little checking and savings accounts . He spoke to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the old man 's questions most satisfactorily . He rented a safety deposit box . The bank officer explained to the old man that he would have a key and the bank would have a key . To open the box , both keys would be needed . No one but the old man could use the old man 's key without a signed , notarized letter of permission from the old man himself . With one exception . " Dussander smiled toothlessly into Todd Bowden 's white , set face . " That exception is made in the event of the box-holder 's death , " he said . Still looking at Todd , still smiling , Dussander put his jackknife back into the pocket of his robe , unscrewed the cap of the bourbon bottle , and poured a fresh jolt into his cup . " What happens then ? " Todd asked hoarsely. t t t .. , 1. , .. . ! in . h .. ernc n 1.1 . , k ... , 4  | representative of the Internal Revenue Service . The contents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find only a twelve-page document . Non-taxable . . . but highly interesting . " The fingers of Todd 's hands crept toward each other and locked tightly . " You ca n't do that , " he said in a stunned and unbelieving voice . It was the voice of a person who observes another person walking on the ceiling . " You ca n't . . . ca n't do that . " " My boy , " Dussander said kindly , " I have . " " But . . . I . . . you . . . " His voice suddenly rose to an agonized howl . " You 're old ! Do n't you know that you 're old ? You could die ! You could die anytime ! " Dussander got up . He went to one of the kitchen cabinets and took down a small glass . This glass had once held jelly . Cartoon characters danced around the rim . Todd recognized them all  --  Fred and Wilma Flintstone , Barney and Betty Rubble , Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm . He had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jelly-glass almost ceremonially with a dishtowel . He watched as Dussander set it in front of him . He watched as Dussander poured a finger of bourbon into it . " What 's that for ? " Todd muttered . " I do n't drink . Drinking 's for cheap stewbums like you . " " Lift your glass , boy . It is a special occasion . Today you drink . " Todd looked at him for a long moment , then picked up the glass . Dussander clicked his cheap ceramic cup smartly against it . " I make a toast , boy  --  long life ! Long life to both of us ! Prosit ! " He tossed his bourbon off at a gulp and then began to laugh . He rocked back and forth , stockinged feet hitting the linoleum , laughing , and Todd thought he had never looked so much like a vulture , a vulture in a bathrobe , a noisome beast of carrion . " I hate you , " he whispered , and then Dussander began to choke on his own laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded as if he were coughing , laughing , and strangling , all at the same time . Todd , scared , got up quickly and clapped him on the bae k until the coughing fit had passed . " Danke schon , " he said . " Drink your drink . It will do you good . " Todd drank it . It tasted like very bad cold-medicine and lit a fire in his gut .  | " I ca n't believe you drink this shit all day , " he said , putting the glass back on the table and shuddering . " You ought to quit it . Quit drinking and smoking . " " Your concern for my health is touching , " Dussander said . He produced a crumpled pack of cigarettes from the same bathrobe pocket into which the jackknife had disappeared . " And I am equally solicitous of your own welfare , boy . Almost every day I read in the paper where a cyclist has been killed at a busy intersection . You should give it up . You should walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you go fuck yourself ? " Todd burst out . " My boy , " Dussander said , pouring more bourbon and beginning to laugh again , " we are fucking each other  --  did n't you know that ? ' One day about a week later , Todd was sitting on a disused mail platform down in the old trainyard . He chucked cinders out across the rusty , weed-infested tracks one at a time . Why should n't I kill him anyway ? Because he was a logical boy , the logical answer came first . No reason at all . Sooner or later Dussander was going to die , and given I ) ussander 's habits , it would probably be sooner . Whether he killed the old man or whether Dussander died of a heart attack in his bathtub , it was all going to come out . At least he could have the pleasure of wringing the old vulture 's neck . Sooner or later  --  that phrase defied logic . Maybe it 'll be later , Todd thought . Cigarettes or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bastard . He 's lasted this long , so . . . so maybe it 'll be later . From beneath him came a fuzzy snort . Todd jumped to his feet , dropping a handful of cinders he had been holding . That snorting sound came again . He paused , on the verge of running , but the snort did n't recur . Nine hundred yards away , an eight-lane freeway swept across the horizon above this weed- and junk-strewn cul-de-sac with its deserted buildings , rusty Cyclone fences , and splintery , warped platforms . The cars up on the freeway glistened in the sun like exotic hard-shelled beetles . Eight lanes of traffic up there , nothing down here but Todd , a few birds . . . and whatever had snorted .  | Cautiously , he bent down with his hands on his knees and peered under the mail platform . There was a wino lying up in there among the yellow weeds and empty cans and dusty old bottles . It was impossible to tell his age ; Todd put him at somewhere between thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was caked with dried vomit , green pants that were far too big for him , and gray leather workshoes cracked in a hundred places . The cracks gaped like agonized mouths . Todd thought he smelled like Dussander 's cellar . The wino 's red-laced eyes opened slowly and stared at Todd with a bleary lack of wonder . As they did , Todd thought of the Swiss Army knife in his pocket , the Angler model . He had purchased it at a sporting goods store in Redondo Beach almost a year ago . He could hear the clerk that had waited on him in his mind : You could n't pick a better knife that that one , son  --  a knife like that could save your life someday . We sell fifteen hundred Swiss knives every damn year . Fifteen hundred a year . He put his hand in his pocket and gripped the knife . In his mind 's eye he saw Dussander 's jackknife working slowly around the neck of the bourbon bottle , slitting the seal . A moment later he became aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The wino swiped a hand over his cracked lips and then licked them with a tongue which nicotine had turned a permanent dismal yellow . " Got a dime , kid ? " Todd looked at him expressionlessly . " Got ta get to L.A. Need another dime for the bus . I got a pointment , me . Got a job offertunity . Nice kid like you must have a dime . Maybe you got a quarter . " Yessir , you could clean out a damn bluegill with a knife lik , that ... hell , you could clean out a damn marlin with it if you had to . We sell fifteen hundred of those a year . Every sporting goods store and Army-Navy Surplus in America sells them , and if you decided to use tluit one to clean out some dirty , shitty old wino , nobody could trace it back to you , absolutely NOBODY . The wino 's voice dropped ; it became a confidential , tenebrous whisper . " For a buck I 'd do you a blowjob , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vnu ' . a ? "  | Todd pulled his hand out of his pocket . He was n't sure what was in it until he opened it . Two quarters . Two nickles . A dime . Some pennies . He threw them at the wino and fled . 12 June , 1975 . Todd Bowden , now fourteen , came biking up Dussander 's walk and parked his bike on the kickstand . The L.A. Times was on the bottom step ; he picked it up . He looked at the bell , below which the neat legends ARTHUR DENKER and NO SOLICITORS , NO PEDDLERS , NO SALESMEN still kept their places . He did n't bother with the bell now , of course ; he had his key . Somewhere close by was the popping , burping sound of a Lawn-Boy . He looked at Dussander 's grass and saw it could use a cutting ; he would have to tell the old man to find a boy with a mower . Dussander forgot little things like that more often now . Maybe it was senility ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his brains . That was an adult thought for a boy of fourteen to have , but such thoughts no longer struck Todd as singular . He had many adult thoughts these days . Most of them were not so great . He let himself in . He had his usual instant of cold terror as he entered the kitchen and saw Dussander slumped slightly sideways in his rocker , the cup on the table , a half-empty bottle of bourbon beside it . A cigarette had burned its entire length down to lacy gray ash in a mayonnaise cover where several other butts had been mashed out . Dussander 's mouth hung open . His face was yellow . His big hands dangled limply over the rocker 's arms . He did n't seem to be breathing . " Dussander , " he said , a little too harshly . " Rise and shine , Dussander . " He felt a wave of relief as the old man twitched , blinked , and finally sat up . " Is it you ? And so early ? " " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , " Todd said . He pointed to the remains of the cigarette in the mayonnaise cover . " C .. 1 . II t . L 1 , . k. , .. C. . ir n. , i4 , . ,  | " Maybe , " Dussander said indifferently . He fumbled out his cigarettes , shot one from the pack ( it almost rolled off the edge of the table before Dussander was able to catch it ) , and at last got it going . A protracted fit of coughing followed , and Todd winced in disgust . When the old man really got going , Todd half-expected him to start spitting out grayish-black chunks of lung-tissue onto the table . . . and he 'd probably grin as he did it . At last the coughing eased enough for Dussander to say , " What have you got there ? " " Report card . " Dussander took it , opened it , and held it away from him at arm 's length so he could read it . " English . . . A. American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Community and You . . . A. Primary French . . . B-minus . Beginning Algebra ... B. " He put it down . " Very good . What is the slang ? We have saved your bacon , boy . Will you have to change any of these averages in the last column ? " " French and algebra , but no more than eight or nine points in all . I do n't think any of this is ever going to come out . And I guess I owe that to you . I 'm not proud of it , but it 's the truth . So , thanks . " " What a touching speech , " Dussander said , and began to cough again . " I guess I wo n't be seeing you around too much from now on , " Todd said , and Dussander abruptly stopped coughing . " No ? " he said , politely enough . " No , " Todd said . " We 're going to Hawaii for a month starting on June twenty-fifth . In September I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bussing thing . " " Oh yes , the Schwarzen , " Dussander said , idly watching a fly as it trundled across the red and white check of the oilcloth . " For twent y years this country has worried and whined about the Schwarzen . But we know the solution . . . do n't we , boy ? " He smiled toothlessly at Todd and Todd looked down , feeling the old sickening lift and ( Imp in his stomach . Terror , hate , and a desire to do something so awful it could only be fully contemplated in his dreams . " Look , I plan to go to college , in case you did n't know , " Id said . " I know that 's a long time off , but I think about it . I even know what I want rn mainr in Hicrnrv "  | " Admirable . He who will not learn from the past is ? " " Oh , shut up , " Todd said . Dussander did so , amiably enough . He knew the boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his hands folded , watching him . " I could get my letter back from my friend , " Todd suddenly blurted . " You know that ? I could let you read it , and then you could watch me burn it . If ? " " ? if I would remove a certain document from my safety deposit box . " " Well .. yeah . " Dussander uttered a long , windy , rueful sigh . " My boy , " he said . " Still you do not understand the situation . You never have , right from the beginning . Partly because you are only a boy , but not entirely . . . even in the beginning , you were a very old boy . No , the real villain was and is your absurd American selfconfidence that never allowed you to consider the possible consequences of what you were doing . . . which does not allow it even now . " Todd began to speak and Dussander raised his hand adamantly , suddenly the world 's oldest traffic cop . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on if you like . Leave the house , get out of here , never come back . Can I stop you ? No . Of course I ca n't . Enjoy yourself in Hawaii while I sit in this hot , grease-smelling kitchen and wait to see if the Schwarzen in Watts will decide to start killing policemen and burning their shitty tenements again this year . I ca n't stop you any more than I can stop getting older a day at a time . " He looked at Todd fixedly , so fixedly that Todd looked away . " Down deep inside , I do n't like you . Nothing could make me like you . You forced yourself on me . You are an unbidden guest in my house . You have made me open crypts perhaps better left shut , because I have discovered that some of the corpses were buried alive , and that a few of those still have some wind left in them . " You yourself have become enmeshed , but do I pity you because of that ? Gott im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity you if you sleep badly in it ? No . . . I do n't pity you , and I do n't like you , but I have come to respect you a little hit . So do n't try my naticnce by asking me to explain this twice . We could obtain our  | documents and destroy them here in my kitchen . And still it would not be over . We would , in fact , be no better off than we are at this minute . " " I do n't understand you . " " No , because you have never studied the consequences of what you have set in motion . But attend me , boy . If we burned our letters here , in this jar cover , how would I know you had n't made a copy ? Or two ? Or three ? Down at the library they have a Xerox machine , for a nickle anyone can make a photocopy . For a dollar , you could post a copy of my death-warrant on every streetcorner for twenty blocks . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you tell me how I would know you had n't done such a thing ? " " I . . . well , I ... I ... " Todd realized he was floundering and forced himself to shut his mouth . All of a sudden his skin felt too warm , and for no reason at all he found himself remembering something that had happened when he was seven or eight . He and a friend of his had been crawling through a culvert which ran beneath the old Freight Bypass Road just out of town . The friend , skinnier than Todd , had had no problem . . . but Todd had gotten stuck . He had become suddenly aware of the feet of rock and earth over his head , all that dark weight , and when an L.A.-bound semi passed above , shaking the earth and making the corrugated pipe vibrate with a low tuneless , and somehow sinister note , he had begun to cry and to struggle witlessly , throwing himself forward , pistoning with his legs , yelling for help . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled out of the pipe , he had fainted . Dussander had just outlined a piece of duplicity so fundamental that it had never even crossed his mind . He could feel his skin getting hotter , and he thought : I wo n't cry . " And how would you know I had n't made two copies for my safety deposit box . . . that I had burned one and left the other there ? " Trapped . I 'm trapped just like in the pipe that time and who are yore going to yell for now ? His heart speeded up in his chest . He felt sweat break on the backs of his hands and the nape of his neck . He remembered how it had been in that pipe , the smell of old water , the feel of the cool ,  | ribbed metal , the way everything shook when the truck passed overhead . He remembered how hot and desperate the tears had been . " Even if there were some impartial third party we could go to , always there would be doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Trapped . Trapped in the pipe . No way out of this one . He felt the world go gray . Wo n't cry . Wo n't faint . He forced himself to come back . Dussander took a deep drink from his cup and looked at Todd over the rim . " Now I tell you two more things . First , that if your part in this matter came out , your punishment would be quite small . It is even possible  --  no , more than that , likely  --  that it would never come out in the papers at all . I frightened you with reform school once , when I was badly afraid you might crack and tell everything . But do I believe that ? No  --  I used it the way a father will use the ' buogerman ' to frighten a child into coming home before dark . I do n't believe that they would send you there , not in this country where they spank killers on the wrist and send them out onto the streets to kill again after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it might well ruin your life all the same . There are records . . . and people talk . Always , they talk . Such a juicy sandal is not allowed to wither ; it is bottled , like wine . And , of course , as the years pass , your culpability will grow with you . Your silence will grow more damning . If the truth came out today , people would say , But he is just a child ! ' ... not knowing , as I do , what an old child you are . But what would they say , boy , if the truth about me , coupled with the fact that you knew about me as early as 1974 but kept silent , came out while you are in high school ? That would be bad . For it to come out while you are in college would be disaster . As a young man just starting out in business .. Armageddon . You understand this first thing ? " was silent , but Dussander seemed satisfied . He nodded . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe you have a letter . "  | Todd strove to keep a poker face , but he was terribly afraid his eyes had widened in shock . Dussander was studying him avidly , and Todd was suddenly , nakedly aware that this old man had interrogated hundreds , perhaps thousands of people . He was an expert . Todd felt that his skull had turned to window-glass and all things were flashing inside in large letters . " I asked myself whom you would trust so much . Who are your friends . . . whom do you run with ? Whom does this boy , this self-sufficient , coldly controlled little boy , go to with his loyalty ? The answer is , nobody . " Dussander 's eyes gleamed yellowly . " Many times I have studied you and calculated the odds . I know you , and I know much of your character  --  no , not all , because one human being can never know everything that is in another human being 's heart  --  but I know so little about what you do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , ' Dussander , there is a chance that you are wrong . After all these years , do you want to be captured and maybe killed because you misjudged a boy ? ' Maybe when I was younger I would have taken the chance  --  the odds are good odds , and the chance is a small chance . It is very strange to me , you know  --  the older one becomes , the less one has to lose in matters of life and death . . . and yet , one becomes more and more conservative . " He looked hard into Todd 's face . " I have one more thing to say , and then you can go when you want . What I have to say is that , while I doubt the existence of your letter , never doubt the existence of mine . The document I hare described to you exists . If I die today . . . tomorrow . . . everything will come out . Everything . " " Then there 's nothing for me , " Todd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you see that ? " " But there is . Years will go by . As they pass , your hold on me will become worth less and less , because no matter how important my life and liberty remain to me , the Americans and  --  yes , even the Israelis  --  will have less and less interest in taking them away . " " Yeah ? Then why do n't they let that guy Hess go ? " " If the Americans had sole custody of him  --  the Americans w let killer , : nut with a cn ; inlc nn thr wrier  --  rhnv huvi ? tr  --  r hi  | go , " Dussander said . " Are the Americans going to allow the Israelis to extradite an eighty-year-old man so they can hang him as they hanged Eichmann ? I think not . Not in a country where they put photographs of firemen rescuing kittens from trees on the front pages of city newspapers . " No , your hold over me will weaken even as mine over you grows stronger . No situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I live long enough  --  when I will decide what you know no longer matters . Then I will destroy the document . " " But so many things could happen to you in between ! Accidents , sickness , disease ? " Dussander shrugged . " ' There will be water if God wills it , and we will find it if God wills it , and we will drink it if God wills it . ' What happens is not up to us . " Todd looked at the old man for a long time  --  for a very long time . There were flaws in Dussander 's arguments  --  there had to be . A way out , an escape hatch either for both of them or for Todd alone . A way to cry it off  --  times , guys , I hurt my foot , allee-allee-in-free . A black knowledge of the years ahead trembled somewhere behind his eyes ; he could feel it there , waiting to be born as conscious thought . Everywhere he went , everything he did He thought of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time he graduated from high school , Dussander would be eighty-one , and that would not be the end ; by the time he collected his B.A. , Dussander would be eighty-five and he would still feel that he was n't old enough , he would finish his master 's thesis and graduate school the year Dussander turned eighty-seven .. and Dussander still might not feel safe . " No , " Todd said thickly . " What you 're saying . . . I ca n't face that. , , " My boy , " Dussander said gently , and Todd heard for the first tone and with dawning horror the slight accent the old man had put on the first word . " My boy ... you must . " ' Ibdd stared at him , his tongue swelling and thickening in his mouth until it seemed it must fill his throat and choke him . Then he wheeled and blundered out of the house . l ) ussancler watched all of this with no expression at all , and when  | the door had slammed shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had mounted his bike , he lit a cigarette . There was , of course , no safe deposit box , no document . But the boy believed those things existed ; he had believed utterly . He was safe . It was ended . But it was not ended . That night they both dreamed of murder , and both of them awoke in mingled terror and exhilaration . Todd awoke with the now familiar stickiness of his lower belly . Dussander , too old for such things , put on the SS uniform and then lay down again , waiting for his racing heart to slow . The uniform was cheaply made and already beginning to fray . In Dussander 's dream he had finally reached the camp at the top of the hill . The wide gate slid open for him and then rumbled shut on its steel track once he was inside . Both the gate and the fencgf surrounding the camp were electrified . His scrawny , naked pursue threw themselves against the fence in wave after wave ; Dussande had laughed at them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , his cap cocked at exactly the right angle . The high , winey smell of burning flesh filled the black air , and he had awakened in southern California thinking of jack-o ' - lanterns and the night when vampires seek the blue flame . Two days before the Bowdens were scheduled to fly to Hawaii , Todd went back to the abandoned trainyard where folks had once boarded trains for San Francisco , Seattle , and Las Vegas ; where other , older folks had once boarded the trolley for Los Angeles . It was nearly dusk when he got there . On the curve of freeway ' nine hundred yards away , most of the cars were now showing t heir parking lights . Although it was warm , Todd was wearing a light jacket . Tucked into his belt under it was a butcher knife wrapped in an old hand-towel . He had purchased the knife in a discount department store , one of the big ones surrounded by acres ** parking lot . He looked under the platform where the wino had been t  | month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned on nothing ; everything inside him at that moment was shades of black on black . What he found was the same wino or possibly another ; they all looked pretty much the same . " Hey ! " Todd said . " Hey ! You want some money ? " The wino turned over , blinking . He saw Todd 's wide , sunny grin and began to grin back . A moment later the butcher knife descended , all whicker-snicker and chrome-white , slicker-slicing through the stubbly right cheek . Blood sprayed . Todd could see the blade in the wino 's opening mouth . . . and then its tip caught for a moment in the left corner of the wino 's lips , pulling his mouth into an insanely cockeyed grin . Then it was the knife that was making the grin ; he was carving the wino like a Halloween pumpkin . He stabbed the wino thirty-seven times . He kept count . Thirty-seven , counting the first strike , which went through the wino 's cheek and then turned his tentative smile into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the fourth stroke . He stopped trying to scramble away from Todd after the sixth . Todd then crawled all the way under the platform and finished the job . On his way home he threw the knife into the river . His pants were bloodstained . He tossed them into the washing machine and set it to wash cold . There were still faint stains on the pants when they came out , but they did n't concern Todd . They would fade in time . He found the next day that he could barely lift his right arm to the level of his shoulder . He told his father he must have strained it throwing pepper with some of the guys in the park . " It 'll get better in Hawaii , " Dick Bowden said , ruffling Todd 's hair , and it did ; by the time they came home , it was as good as new . 13 It was July again . Dussander , carefully dressed in one of his three suits ( not his Ix  --  st ) , was standing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day to take him home . It was 10:45 P.M. He had been to a film ,  | a light and frothy comedy that he had enjoyed a great deal . He had been in a fine mood ever since the morning mail . There had been a postcard from the boy , a glossy color photo of Waikiki Beach with bone-white highrise hotels standing in the background . There was a brief message on the reverse . Dear Mr. Denker , Boy this sure is some place . I 've been swimming every day . My dad caught a big fish and my mom is catching up on her reading ( joke ) . Tomorrow we 're going to a volcano . I 'll try not to fall in ! Hope you 're okay . Stay healthy , Todd He was still smiling faintly at the significance of that last when a hand touched his elbow . " Mister ? " " Yes ? " He turned , on his guard  --  even in Santo Donato , muggers were not unknown  --  and then winced at the aroma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dried sweat , and possibly Musterole . It was a bum in baggy pants . He  --  it  --  wore a flannel shirt and very old loafers that were currently being held together with dirty bands of adhesive tape . The face looming above this motley costume looked like the death of God . " You got an extra dime , mister ? I got ta get to L.A. , me . Got a job offertunity . I need just a dime more for the express bus . I wud n't ask if it wad n't a big chance for me . " Dussander had begun to frown , but now his smile reasserted itself . " Is it really a bus ride you wish ? " The wino smiled sickly , not understanding . " Suppose you ride the bus home with me , " Dussander proposed . " I can offer you a drink , a meal , a bath , and a bed . All I ask In return is a little conversation . I am an old man . I live alone . Company is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more healthy as the situation  | clarified itself . Here was a well-to-do old faggot with a taste for slumming . " All by yourself ! Bitch , in n it ? " Dussander answered the broad , insinuating grin with a polite smile . " I only ask that you sit away from me on the bus . You smell rather strongly . " " Maybe you do n't want me stinking up your place , then , " the drunk said with sudden , tipsy dignity . " Come , the bus will be here in a minute . Get off one stop after I do and then walk back two blocks . I 'll wait for you on the corner . In the morning I will see what I can spare . Perhaps two dollars . " " Maybe even five , " the drunk said brightly . His dignity , tipsy or otherwise , had been forgotten . I , " Perhaps , perhaps , " Dussander said impatiently . He could now j hear the low diesel drone of the approaching bus . He pressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bum 's grimy hand and strolled a few paces away without looking back . I ! I The bum stood undecided as the headlights of the local swept over the rise . He was still standing and frowning down at the quarter when the old faggot got on the bus without looking back . The bum began to walk away and then  --  at the last second  --  he reversed direction and boarded the bus just before the doors folded losed . He put the quarter into the fare-box with the expression of a man putting a hundred dollars down on a long shot . He passed Dussander without doing more than glancing at him and sat at the back of the bus . He dozed off a little , and when he woke up , the rich old faggot was gone . He got off at the next stop , not knowing if it was the right one or not , and not really caring . He walked back two blocks and saw a dim shape under the streetlight . It was the old faggot , all right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if at attention . Ikor just a moment the bum felt a chill of apprehension , an urge to just turn away and forget the whole thing . Then the old man was gripping him by the arm . . . and his grip was surprisingly firm . " Good , " the old man said . " I 'm very glad you came . My house is down here . It 's not far . "  | " Maybe even ten , " the bum said , allowing himself to be led . " Maybe even ten , " the old faggot agreed , and then laughed . " Who knows ? " 14 The Bi-Centennial year arrived . Todd came by to see Dussander half a dozen times between his return from Hawaii in the summer of 1975 and the trip he and his parents took to Rome just as all the drum-thumping , flag-waving , and Tall Ships  --  watching was approaching its climax . These visits to Dussander were low-key and in no way unpleasant ; the two of them found they could pass the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did in words , and their actual conversations would have put an FBI agent to sleep . Todd told the old man that he had been seeing a girl named Angela Farrow off and on . He was n't nuts about her , but she was the daughter of one of his mother 's friends . The old man told Todd he had taken up braiding rugs because he had read such an activity was good for arthritis. 1 le showed Todd several samples of his work , and Todd dutifully admired them . The boy had grown quite a bit , had he not ? ( Well , two inches . ) Had Dussander given up smoking ? ( No , but he had been forced to cut down ; they made him cough too much now . ) How had his schoolwork been ? ( Challenging but exciting ; he had made all As and B 's , had gone to the state finals with his Science Fair project on solar power , and was now thinking of majoring in anthropology instead of history when he got to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Randy Chambers from just down the street  --  a good boy , but rather fat and slow . ) During that year Dussander had put an end to three winos in Ins kitchen . He had been approached at the downtown bus stop some twenty times , had made the **25;1313;TOOLONG offer seven times . He had been turned down twice , and on two other occasions the winos had simply walked off with the quarters Dussander guy  | them for the fare-box . After some thought , he had worked out a way around this ; he simply bought a book of coupons . They were two dollars and fifty cents , good for fifteen rides , and nonnegotiable at the local liquor stores . On very warm days just lately , Dussander had noticed an unpleasant smell drifting up from his cellar . He kept his doors and windows firmly shut on these days . Todd Bowden had found a wino sleeping it off in an abandoned drainage culvert behind a vacant lot on Cienaga Way  --  this had been in December , during the Christmas vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed into his pockets , looking at the wino and trembling . He had returned to the lot six times over a period of five weeks , always wearing his light jacket , zipped halfway up to conceal the Craftsman hammer tucked into his belt . At last he had come upon the wino again  --  that one or some other , and who really gave a fuck  --  on the first day of March . He had begun with the hammer end of the tool , and then at some point ( he did n't really remember when ; everything had been swimming in a red haze ) he had switched to the claw end , obliterating the wino 's face . For Kurt Dussander , the winos were a half-cynical propitiation of gods he had finally recognized ... or re-recognized . And the winos were fun . They made him feel alive . He was beginning to feel that the years he had spent in Santo Donato  --  the years before the boy had turned up on his doorstep with his big blue eyes and his wide American grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been just past his mid-sixties when he came here . And he felt much younger than that now . The idea of propitiating gods would have startled Todd at first  --  but it might have gained eventual acceptance . After stabbing the wino under the train platform , he had expected his nightmares to intensify  --  to perhaps even drive him crazy . He had expected waves of paralyzing guilt that might well end with a blurted confession or the taking of his own life . Instead of any of those things , he had gone to Hawaii with his parents and enjoyed the best vacation of his life . He had begun high school last September feeling oddly new and  | refreshed , as if a different person had jumped into his Todd Bowden skin . Things that had made no particular impression on him since earliest childhood  --  the sunlight just after dawn , the look of the ocean off the Fish Pier , the sight of people hurrying on a downtown street at just that moment of dusk when the streetlights come on  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of bright cameos , in images so clear they seemed electroplated . He tasted life on his tongue like a draught of wine straight from the bottle . After he had seen the stewbum in the culvert , but before he killed him , the nightmares had begun again . The most common one involved the wino he had stabbed to death in the abandoned trainyard . Home from school , he burst into the house , a cheery Hi , Monica-baby ! on his lips . It died there as he saw the dead wino in the raised breakfast nook . He was sitting slumped over their butcher-block table in his puke-smelling shirt and pants . Blood had streaked across the bright tiled floor ; it was drying on the stainless steel counters . There were bloody handprints on the natural pine cupboards . Clipped to the note-board by the fridge was a message from his mother : Todd  --  Gone to the store . Back by 3:30 . The hands of the stylish sunburst clock over the Jenn-Air range stood at 3:20 and the drunk was sprawled dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the subcellar of a junkshop and there was blood everywhere , and Todd began trying to clean it up , wiping every exposed surface , all the time screaming at the dead wino that he had to go , had to leave him alone , and the wino just lolled there and stayed dead , grinning up at the ceiling , and freshets of blood kept pouring from the stab-wounds in his dirty skin . Todd grabbed the O Cedar mop from the closet and began to slide it madly back and forth across the floor , aware that he was not really getting the blood up , only diluting it , spreading it around , but unable to stop . And just as he heard his mother 's Town and Country wagon turn into the driveway , he realized the wino was Dussander . He wukc from these dreams sweating and gasping , clutching double handfuls of the bedclothes . But after he finally found the wino in the culvert again  --  that  | wino or some other  --  and used the hammer on him , these dreams went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe more than once . It was too bad , but of course their time of usefulness as human creatures was over . Except their usefulness to Todd , of course . And Todd , like everyone else he knew , was only tailoring his lifestyle to fit his own particular needs as he grew older . Really , he was no different than anybody . You had to make your own way in the world ; if you were going to get along , you had to do it by yourself . 15 In the fall of his junior year , Todd played varsity tailback for the Santo Donato Cougars and was named All-Conference . And in the second quarter of that year , the quarter which ended in late January of 1977 , he won the American Legion Patriotic Essay Contest . This contest was open to all city high school students who were taking American history courses . Todd 's piece was called " An American 's Responsibility . " During the baseball season that year he was the school 's star pitcher , winning four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the awards assembly in June he was named Athlete of the Year and given a plaque by Coach Haines ( Coach Haines , who had once taken him aside and told him to keep practicing his curve " because none of these niggers can hit a curve-ball , Bowden , not one of them " ) . Monica Bowden burst into tears when Todd called her from school and told her he was going to get the award . Dick Bowden strutted around his office for two weeks following the ceremony , trying not to boast . That summer they rented a cabin in Big Sur and stayed there for two weeks and Todd snorkled his brains out . During that same year Todd killed four derelicts . He stabbed two of them and bludgeoned two of them . He had taken to wearing two pairs of pants on what he now acknowledged to be hunting expeditions . Sometimes he rode the city busses , looking for likely spots . The best two , he found , were the Santo Donato Mission for the Indigent on Douglas Street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would walk slowly through both of these neighborhoods , waiting to be  | panhandled . When a wino approached him , Todd would tell him that he , Todd , wanted a bottle of whiskey , and if the wino would buy it , Todd would share the bottle . He knew a place , he said , where they could go . It was a different place every time , of course . He resisted a strong urge to go back either to the trainyard or to the culvert behind the vacant lot on Cienaga Way . Revisiting the scene of a previous crime would have been unwise . During the same year Dussander smoked sparingly , drank Ancient Age bourbon , and watched TV . Todd came by once in awhile , but their conversations became increasingly arid . They were growing apart . Dussander celebrated his seventy-ninth birthday that year , which was also the year Todd turned sixteen . Dussander remarked that sixteen was the best year of a young man 's life , forty-one the best year of a middle-aged man 's , and seventy-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely . Dussander had been quite drunk , and cackled in a way that made Todd distinctly uneasy . Dussander had dispatched two winos during Todd 's academic year of 1976-77 . The second had been livelier than he looked ; even after Dussander had gotten the man soddenly drunk he had tottered around the kitchen with the haft of a steak-knife jutting from the base of his neck , gushing blood down the front of his shirt and onto the floor . The wino had re-discovered the front hall after two staggering circuits of the kitchen and had almost escaped the house . Dussander had stood in the kitchen , eyes wide with shocked unbelief , watching the wino grunt and puff his way toward the door , rebounding from one side of the hall to the other and knocking cheap Currier &; Ives reproductions to the floor . Ills paralysis had not broken until the wino was actually groping for the doorknob . Then Dussander had bolted across the room , jerked open the utility drawer , and pulled out his meat-fork . He ran down the hall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the wino 's back . Dussander had stood over him , panting , his old heart racing in a frightening way . . . racing like that of a heart-attack victim on that Saturday night TV program he enjoyed , Emergency ! But at lust it had slowed back into a normal rhythm and he knew he was goi  | There had been a great deal of blood to clean up . That had been four months ago , and since then he had not made his offer at the downtown bus stop . He was frightened of the way he had almost bungled the last one . . . but when he remembered the way he had handled things at the last moment , pride rose in his heart . In the end the wino had never made it out the door , and that was the important thing . 16 In the fall of 1977 , during the first quarter of his senior year , Todd joined the Rifle Club . By June of 1978 he had qualified as a marksman . He made All-Conference in football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season ( the loss coming as the result of two errors and one unearned run ) , and made the third highest Merit Scholarship score in the school 's history . He applied to Berkeley and was promptly accepted . By April he knew he would either be valedictorian or salutatorian on graduation night . He very badly wanted to be valedictorian . During the latter half of his senior year , an odd impulse came on him  --  one which was as frightening to Todd as it was irrational . He seemed to be clearly and firmly in control of it , and that at least was comforting , but that such a thought should have occurred at all was vary . He had made an arrangement with life . He had worked things out . His life was much like his mother 's bright and sunshiny kitchen , where all the surfaces were dressed in chrome , Formica , or stainless steel  --  a place where everything worked when you pressed the buttons . There were deep and dark cupboards in this kitchen , of urse , but many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closed . This new impulse reminded him of the dream in which he had Inc home to discover the dead and bleeding wino in his mother 's ! lean , well-lighted place . It was as if , in the bright and careful arrangement he had made , in that **49;1340;TOOLONG kitchen of his mind , a dark and bloody Intruder now lurched and shambled , looking for a place to die Conspicuously . . . A ntI:Irr , r of n mil ' frnm rhr Rnwrlrn hnncr wnc the frrr'wnu.  | running eight lanes wide . A steep and brushy bank led down to it . There was plenty of good cover on the bank . His father had given him a Winchester .30-.30 for Christmas , and it had a removable telescopic sight . During rush hour , when all eight lanes were jammed , he could pick a spot on that bank and . . . why , he could easily . . . Do what ? Commit suicide ? Destroy everything he had worked for these last four years ? Say what ? No sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , to laugh . Sure it was . . . but the impulse remained . One Saturday a few weeks before his high school graduation , Todd cased the .30-.30 after carefully emptying the magazine . He put the rifle in the back seat of his father 's new toy  --  a used Porsche . He drove to the spot where the brushy slope dropped steeply down to the freeway . His mother and father had taken the station wagon and had driven to L.A. for the weekend . Dick , now a full partner , would be holding discussions with the Hyatt people about a new Reno hotel . Todd 's heart bumped in his chest and his mouth was full of sour , electric spit as he worked his way down the grade with the cased rifle in his arms . He came to a fallen tree and sat cross-legged behind it . He uncased the rifle and laid it on the dead tree 's smooth trunk . A branch jutting off at an angle made a nice rest for the barrel . He snugged the buttplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telescopic sight . Stupid ! his mind screamed at him . Boy , this is really stupid . ' If someone sees you , it 's not going to matter if the gun 's loaded or not ! You 'll gif in plenty of trouble , maybe even end up with some Chippie shooting at you ! It was mid-morning and the Saturday traffic was light . He sett led the crosshairs on a woman behind the wheel of a blue ' Ibyota . The woman 's window was half-open and the round collar of her sleeveless blouse was fluttering . Todd centered the crosshairs on her temple and dry-fired . It was bad for the firing-pin , but what t fuck .  | " Pow , " he whispered as the Toyota disappeared beneath the underpass half a mile up from the slope where Todd sat . He swallowed around a lump that tasted like a stuck-together mass of pennies . Here came a man behind the wheel of a Subaru Brat pickup truck . This man had a scuzzy-looking gray beard and was wearing a San Diego Padres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty rat . . . the dirty rat that shot my brudduh , " Todd whispered , giggling a little , and dry-fired the .30-.30 again . He shot at five others , the impotent snap of the hammer spoiling the illusion at the end of each " kill . " Then he cased the rifle again . He carried it back up the slope , bending low to keep from being seen . He put it into the back of the Porsche . There was a dry hot pounding in his temples . He drove home . Went up to his room . Masturbated. 17 The stewbum was wearing a ragged , unravelling reindeer sweater that looked so startling it almost seemed surreal here in southern California . He also wore seaman 's issue bluejeans which were out at the knees , showing white , hairy flesh and a number of peeling scabs . He raised the jelly-glass  --  Fred and Wilma , Barney and Betty dancing around the rim in what might have been some Krotesque fertility rite  --  and tossed off the knock of Ancient Age at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this world . " Mister , that hits the old spot . I do n't mind saying so . " " I always enjoy a drink in the evening , " , Dussander agreed from ( x  --  hind him , and then rammed the butcher knife into the stewbum 's neck . There was the sound of ripping gristle , a sound like a drumstick being torn enthusiastically from a freshly roasted chicken . The jelly-glass fell from the stewbum 's hand and onto the table . It rolled toward the edge , its movement enhancing the illusion that the cartoon characters on it were dancing . Tie stewbum threw his head back and tried to scream . Nothing ' unit out but a hideous whistling sound . His eyes widened , widened . .. and then his head thumped soggily onto the red and  | white oilcloth check that covered Dussander 's kitchen table : The stewbum 's upper plate slithered halfway out of his mouth like a semi-detachable grin . Dussander yanked the knife free  --  he had to use both hands to do it  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water , Lemon Fresh Joy , and dirty supper dishes . The knife disappeared into a billow of citrus-smelling suds like a very small fighter plane diving into a cloud . He crossed to the table again and paused there , resting one hand on the dead stewbum 's shoulder while a spasm of coughing rattled through him . He took his handkerchief from his back pocket and spat yellowish-brown phlegm into it . He had been smoking too much lately . He always did when he was making up his mind to do another one . But this one had gone smoothly ; really very smoothly . He had been afraid after the mess he had made with the last one that he might be tempting fate sorely to try it again . Now , if he hurried , he would still be able to watch the second half of Lawrence Welk . He bustled across the kitchen , opened the cellar door , and turned on the light switch . He went back to the sink and got the package of green plastic garbage bags from the cupboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slumped wino . Blood had run across the oilcloth in all directions . It had puddled in the wino 's lap and on the hilly , faded linoleum . It would be on the chair , too , but all of those things would clean up . Dussander grabbed the stewbum by the hair and yanked his head up . It came with boneless ease , and a moment later the wino was lolling backwards , like a man about to get a pre-haircut shampoo . Dussander pulled the garbage bag down over the wino 's head , over his shoulders , and down his arms to the elbows . That was as far as it would go . He unbuckled his late guest 's belt and pulled it free of the fraying belt-loops . He wrapped the belt around t l he garbage bag two or three inches above the elbows and buckled it tight . Plastic rustled . Dussander began to hum under his breath . The wino 's feet were clad in scuffed and dirty I lush Puppies . They made a limp V on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corpse toward the cellar door . Something white tumbled out of the plastic bag and clicked on the floor . It was the stewbum 's upper plate , Dussander saw . He picked it up and stuffed it into one of the wino 's front pockets . He laid the wino down in the cellar doorway with his head now lolling backwards onto the second stair-level . Dussander climbed around the body and gave it three healthy kicks . The body moved slightly on the first two , and the third sent it slithering bonelessly down the stairs . Halfway down , the feet flew up over the head and the body executed an acrobatic roll . It belly-whopped onto the packed dirt of the cellar floor with a solid thud . One Hush Puppy flew off , and Dussander made a mental note to pick it up . He went down the stairs , skirted the body , and approached his toolbench . To the left of the bench a spade , a rake , and a hoe leaned against the wall in a neat rank . Dussander selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man . A little exercise could make you feel young . The smell down here was not good , but it did n't bother him much . He limed the place once a month ( once every three days after he had " done " one of his winos ) and he had gotten a fan which he ran upstairs to keep the smell from permeating the house on very warm still days . Josef Kramer , he remembered , had been fond of saying that the dead speak , but we hear them with our noses . Dussander picked a spot in the cellar 's north corner and went to work . The dimensions of the grave were two and a half feet by six feet . He had gotten to a depth of two feet , half deep enough , when the first paralyzing pain struck him in the chest like a shotgun blast . He straightened up , eyes flaring wide . Then the pain rolled down his arm . . unbelievable pain , as if an invisible hand had siezed all the blood-vessels in there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways and felt his knees buckle . For one horrible moment he felt sure that he was going to fall into the grave himself . Somehow he staggered backwards three paces and sat down on his workbench with a plop . There was an expression of stupid surprise on his face  --  he could feel it  --  and he thought he must look like one of those silent movie comedians after he 's been hit by the swinging  | door or stepped in the cow patty . He put his head down between his knees and gasped . Fifteen minutes crawled by . The pain had begun to abate somewhat , but he did not believe he would be able to stand . For the first time he understood all the truths of old age which he had been spared until now . He was terrified almost to the point of whimpering . Death had brushed by him in this dank , smelly cellar ; it had touched Dussander with the hem of its robe . It might be back for him yet . But he would not die down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , hands still crossed on his chest , as if to hold the fragile machinery together . He staggered across the open space between the workbench and the stairs . His left foot tripped over the dead wino 's outstretched leg and he went to his knees with a small cry . There was a sullen flare of pain in his chest . He looked up the stairs  --  the steep , steep stairs . Twelve of them . The square of light at the top was mockingly distant . " Ein , " Kurt Dussander said , and pulled himself grimly up onto the first stair-level . " Zwei , Drei , Vier . " It took him twenty minutes to reach the linoleum floor of the kitchen . Twice , on the stairs , the pain had threatened to come back , and both times Dussander had waited with his eyes closed to see what would happen , perfectly aware that if it came back as strongly as it had come upon him down there , he would probably die . Both times the pain had faded away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , avoiding the pools and streaks of blood , which were now congealing . He got the bottle of Ancient Age , took a swallow , and closed his eyes . Something that had been cinched tight in his chest seemed to loosen a little . The pain faded a bit more . After another five minutes he began to work his way slowly down the hall . His telephone sat on a small table halfway down . It was quarter past nine when the phone rang in the Bowden house . Todd was sitting cross-legged on the couch , going over his notes for the trig final . Trig was a bitch for him , as all maths were and probably always would be . His father was seated across the room , going through the checkbook stubs with a portable calculator  | on his lap and a mildly disbelieving expression on his face . Monica , closest to the phone , was watching the James Bond movie Todd had taped off HBO two evenings before . " Hello ? " She listened . A faint frown touched her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's Mr. Denker . He sounds excited about something . Or upset . " Todd 's heart leaped into his throat , but his expression hardly changed . " Really ? " He went to the phone and took it from her . " Hi , Mr. Denker . " Dussander 's voice was hoarse and short . " Come over right away , boy . I 've had a heart attack . Quite a bad one , I think . " " Gee , " Todd said , trying to collect his flying thoughts , to see around the fear that now bulked huge in his own mind . " That 's interesting , all right , but it 's pretty late and I was studying ? " " I understand that you can not talk , " Dussander said in that harsh , almost barking voice . " But you can listen . I can not call an ambulance or dial two-two-two , boy . . at least not yet . There is a mess here . I need help . . and that means you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it that way . . . " Todd 's heartbeat had reached a hundred and twenty beats a minute , but his face was calm , almost serene . Had n't he known all along that a night like this would come ? Yes , of course he had . " Tell your parents I 've had a letter , " Dussander said . " An important letter . You understand ? " " Yeah , okay , " Todd said . " Now we see , boy . We see what you are made of . " " Sure , " Todd said . He suddenly became aware that his mother was watching him instead of the movie , and he forced a stiff grin onto his face . " Bye . " I ) ussander was saying something else now , but Todd hung up on it . " I 'm going over to Mr. Denker 's for awhile , " he said , speaking to both of them but looking at his mother  --  that faint expression of concern was still on her face . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store ? " " Pipe cleaners for me and a small package of fiscal responsibility for your mother , " Dick said . " Very funny , " Monica said . " Todd , is Mr. Denker ? "  | " What in the name of God did you get at Fielding 's ? " Dick interrupted . " That knick-knack shelf in the closet . I told you that . There 's nothing wrong with Mr. Denker , is there , Todd ? He sounded a little strange . " " There really are such things as knick-knack shelves ? I thought those crazy women who write British mysteries made them up so there would always be a place where the killer could find a blunt instrument . " " Dick , can I get a word in edgeways ? " " Sure . Be my guest . But for the closet ? " " He 's okay , I guess , " Todd said . He put on his letter jacket and zipped it up . " But he was excited . He got a letter from a nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't heard from any of his people in years , and now he 's got this letter and his eyes are n't good enough for him to read it . " " Well is n't that a bitch , " Dick said . " Go on , Todd . Get over there and ease the man 's mind . " " I thought he had someone to read to him , " Monica said . " A new boy . " " He does , " Todd said , suddenly hating his mother , hating the half-formed intuition he saw swimming in her eyes . " Maybe he was n't home , or maybe he could n't come over this late . " " Oh . Well .. go on , then . But be careful . " " I will . You do n't need anything at the store ? " " No . How 's your studying for that calculus final going ? " " It 's trig , " Todd said . " Okay , I guess . I was just getting ready to call it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to take the Porsche ? " Dick asked . " No , I 'll ride my bike . " He wanted the extra five minutes to collect his thoughts and get his emotions under control  --  to try , at least . And in his present state , he would probably drive the Porst hr into a telephone pole . " Strap your reflector-patch on your knee , " Monica said , " and tell Mr. Denker hello for us . " " Okay . " That doubt was still in his mother 's eyes but it was less evidenq  | now . He blew her a kiss and then went out to the garage where his bike  --  -a racing-style Italian bike rather than a Schwinn now  --  was parked . His heart was still racing in his chest , and he felt a mad urge to take the .30-.30 back into the house and shoot both of his parents and then go down to the slope overlooking the freeway . No more worrying about Dussander . No more bad dreams , no more winos . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet back for the end . Then reason came back to him and he rode away toward Dussander 's , his reflector-patch revolving up and down just above his knee , his long blonde hair streaming back from his brow . " Holy Christ ! " Todd nearly screamed . He was standing in the kitchen door . Dussander was slumped on his elbows , his china cup between them . Large drops of sweat stood out on his forehead . But it was not Dussander Todd was looking at . It was the blood . There seemed to be blood everywhere  --  it was puddled on the table , on the empty kitchen chair , on the floor . " Where are you bleeding ? " Todd shouted , at last getting his frozen feet to move again  --  it seemed to him that he had been standing in the doorway for at least a thousand years . This is the end , he was thinking , this is the absolute end of everything . The balloon is going up high , baby , all the way to the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the same , he was careful not to step in any of the blood . " I thought you said you had a fucking heart attack ! " " It 's not my blood , " Dussander muttered . " What ? " Todd stopped . " What did you say ? " " Go downstairs . You will see what has to be done . " " What the hell is this ? " Todd asked . A sudden terrible idea had come into his head . " Do n't waste our time , boy . I think you will not be too surprised ut what you find downstairs . I think you have had experience in such matters as the one in my cellar . First-hand experience . " ' Iixid looked at him , unbelieving , for another moment , and then he plunged down the cellar stairs two by two . His first look in the feeble yellow glow of the basement 's only light made him think that Dussander had pushed a bag of garbage down here . Then he saw the  | protruding legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cinched belt . " Holy Christ , " he repeated , but this time the words had no force at all  --  they emerged in a slight , skeletal whisper . He pressed the back of his right hand against lips that were as dry as sandpaper . He closed his eyes for a moment . . . and when he opened them again , he felt in control of himself at last . Todd started moving . He saw the spade-handle protruding from a shallow hole in the far corner and understood at once what Dussander had been doing when his ticker had seized up . A moment later he became fully aware of the cellar 's fetid aroma  --  a smell like rotting tomatoes . He had smelled it before , but upstairs it was much fainter  --  and , of course , he had n't been here very often over the last couple of years . Now he understood exactly what that smell meant and for several moments he had to struggle with his gorge . A series of choked gagging sounds , muffled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from him . Little by little he got control of himself again . He seized the wino 's legs and dragged him across to the edge of the hole . He dropped them , skidded sweat from his forehead with the heel of his left hand , and stood absolutely still for a moment , thinking harder than he ever had in his life . Then he seized the spade and began to deepen the hole . When it was five feet deep , he got out and shoved the derelict 's body in with his foot . Todd stood at the edge of the grave , looking down . Tattered bluejeans . Filthy , scab-encrusted hands . It was a stewbum , all right . The irony was almost funny . So funny a person could scream with laughter . He ran back upstairs . " How are you ? " he asked Dussander . " I 'll be all right . Have you taken care of it ? " " I 'm doing it , okay ? " " Be quick . There 's still up here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed you to them , " Todd said , and went back down cellar before Dussander could reply . He had almost completely covered the wino when he began to  | think there was something wrong . He stared into the grave , grasping the spade 's handle with one hand . The wino 's legs stuck partway out of the mound of dirt , as did the tips of his feet  --  one old shoe , possibly a Hush Puppy , and one filthy athletic sock that might actually have been white around the time that Taft was President . One Hush Puppy ? One ? Todd half-ran back around the furnace to the foot of the stairs . He glanced around wildly . A headache was beginning to thud against his temples , dull drillbits trying to work their way out . He spotted the old shoe five feet away , overturned in the shadow of some abandoned shelving . Todd grabbed it , ran back to the grave with it , and threw it in . Then he started to shovel again . He covered the shoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the hole , he slammed the spade down repeatedly to tamp it . Then he grabbed the rake and ran it back and forth , trying to disguise the fact the earth here had been recently turned . Not much use ; without good camouflage , a hole that has been recently dug and then filled in always looks like a hole that has been recently dug and then filled in . Still , no one would have any occasion to come down here , would they ? He and Dussander would damn well have to hope not . Todd ran back upstairs . He was starting to pant . Dussander 's elbows had spread wide and his head had sagged down to the table . His eyes were closed , the lids a shiny purple  --  the color of asters . " Dussander ! " Todd shouted . There was a hot , juicy taste in his mouth  --  the taste of fear mixed with adrenaline and pulsing hot blood . " Do n't you dare die on me , you old fuck ! " " Keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll have everyone on the block over here . " " Where 's your cleaner ? Lestoil . . . Top Job . . . something like that . And rags . I need rags . " " All that is under the sink . " A lot of the blood had now dried on . Dussander raised his head and watched as Todd crawled across the floor , scrubbing first at the puddle on the linoleum and then at the drips that had straggled  | down the legs of the chair the wino had been sitting in . The boy was biting compulsively at his lips , champing at them , almost , like a horse at a bit . At last the job was finished . The astringent smell of cleaner filled the room . " There is a box of old rags under the stairs , " Dussander said . " Put those bloody ones on the bottom . Do n't forget to wash your hands . " " I do n't need your advice . You got me into this . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For a moment the old mockery was in Dussander 's voice , and then a bitter grimace pulled his face into a new shape . " Hurry . " Todd took care of the rags , then hurried up the cellar stairs for the last time . He looked nervously down the stairs for a moment , then snapped off the light and closed the door . He went to the sink , rolled up his sleeves , and washed in the hottest water he could stand . He plunged his hands into the suds . . . and came up holding the butcher knife Dussander had used . " I 'd like to cut your throat with this , " Todd said grimly . " Yes , and then feed me to the pigs . I have no doubt of it . " Todd rinsed the knife , dried it , and put it away . He did the rest of the dishes quickly , let the water out , and rinsed the sink . He looked at the clock as he dried his hands and saw it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hallway , picked up the receiver , and looked at it thoughtfully . The idea that he had forgotten something ? something as potentially damning as the wino 's shoe  --  nagged unpleasantly at his mind . What ? He did n't know . If not for the headache , he might be able to get it . The triple-damned headache . It was n't like him to forget things , and it was scary . He dialed 222 and after a single ring , a voice answered : " This is Santo Donato MED-Q . Do you have a medical problem ? " " My name is Todd Bowden . I 'm at 963 Claremont Street . I need an ambulance . " " What 's the problem , son ? " " It 's my friend , Mr. D ? " He bit down on his lip so hard that it squirted blood , and for a moment he was lost , drowning in the pulses of pain from his head . Dussander . He had almost given this anonymous MED-Q voice Dussander 's real name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Take it slow and you 'll be fine . " " My friend Mr. Denker , " Todd said . " I think he 's had a heart attack . " " His symptoms ? " Todd began to give them , but the voice had heard enough as soon as Todd described the chest pain that had migrated to the left arm . He told Todd the ambulance would arrive in ten to twenty minutes , depending on the traffic . Todd hung up and pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes . " Did you get it ? " Dussander called weakly . " Yes ! " Todd screamed . " Yes , I got it ! Yes goddammit yes ! Yes yes yes ! Just shut up ! " He pressed his hands even harder against his eyes , creating first senseless starflashes of light and then a bright field of red . Get hold of yourself , Todd-baby . Get down , get funky , get cool . Dig it . He opened his eyes and picked up the telephone again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call home . " Hello ? " Monica 's soft , cultured voice in his ear . For a moment ? just a moment  --  he saw himself slamming the muzzle of the i0-.30 into her nose and pulling the trigger into the first flow of blood . " It 's Todd , Mommy . Let me talk to Dad , quick . " He did n't call her mommy anymore . He knew she would get that signal quicker than anything else , and she did . " What 's the matter ? Is something wrong , Todd ? " " Just let me talk to him ! " " But what ? " The phone rattled and clunked . He heard his mother saying something to his father . Todd got ready . " ' Ibdd ? What 's the problem ? " " It 's Mr. Denker , Daddy . He ... it 's a heart attack , I think . I 'm pretty sure it is . " " Jesus ! " His father 's voice lagged away for a moment and Todd heard him repeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I k 's still alive ? As far as you can tell ? " " I k 's alive . Conscious . " " Alt right , thank God for that . Call an ambulance . "  | " I just did . " " Two-two-two ? " " Yes . " " Good boy . How bad is he , can you tell ? " " I do n't know , Dad . They said the ambulance would be here soon , but . . . I 'm sorta scared . Can you come over and wait with me ? " " You bet . Give me four minutes . " Todd could hear his mother saying something else as his father hung up , breaking the connection . Todd replaced the receiver on his end . Four minutes . Four minutes to do anything that had been left undone . Four minutes to remember whatever it was that had been forgotten . Or had he forgotten anything ? Maybe it was just nerves . God , he wished he had n't had to call his father . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? Sure . Was there some natural thing that he had n't done ? Something ? ? " Oh , you shit-for-brains ! " he suddenly moaned , and bolted back into the kitchen . Dussander 's head lay on the table , his eyes half-open , sluggish . " Dussander ! " Todd cried . He shook Dussander roughly , and the old man groaned . " Wake up ! Wake up , you stinking old bastard ! " " What ? Is it the ambulance ? " " The letter ! My father is coming over , he 'll be here in no time . Where 's the fucking letter ? " " What . . . what letter ? " " You told me to tell them you got an important letter . I said . . . " His heart sank . " I said it came from overseas on Germany . Christ ! " Todd ran his hands through his hair . " A letter . " Dussander raised his head with slow difficulty . Ills seamed cheeks were an unhealthy yellowish-white , his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankel . Dear . . . dear Willi . " Todd looked at his watch and saw that already two minutes hit4 passed since he had hung up the phone . His father would not , row/4 not make it from their house to Dussander 's in four minutes , but I  | could do it damn fast in the Porsche . Fast , that was it . Everything was moving too fast . And there was still something wrong here ; he felt it . But there was no time to stop and hunt around for the loophole . " Yes , okay , I was reading it to you , and you got excited and had this heart attack . Good . Where is it ? " Dussander looked at him blankly . " The letter ! Where is it ? " " What letter ? " Dussander asked vacantly , and Todd 's hands itched to throttle the drunken old monster . " The one I was reading to you ! The one from Willi What's-hisface ! Where is it ? " They both looked at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Upstairs , " Dussander said finally . " Look in my dresser . The third drawer . There is a small wooden box in the bottom of that drawer . You will have to break it open . I lost the key a long time ago . There are some very old letters from a friend of mine . None signed . None dated . All in German . A page or two will serve for window-fittings , as you would say . If you hurry ? " " Are you crazy ? " Todd raged . " I do n't understand German ! How could I read you a letter written in German , you numb fuck ? " " Why would Willi write me in English ? " Dussander countered wearily . " If you read me the letter in German , I would understand it even if you did not . Of course your pronunciation would be butchery , but still , I could ? " Dussander was right  --  right again , and Todd did n't wait to hear more . Even after a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raced down the hall to the stairs , pausing just long enough by the front door to make sure his father 's Porsche was n't pulling up even flow . It was n't , but Todd 's watch told him just how tight things were getting ; it had been five minutes now . He took the stairs two at a time and burst into Dussander 's bedroom . He had never been up here before , had n't even been curious , and for a moment he only looked wildly around at the unfamiliar territory . Then he saw the dresser , a cheap item done in the style his father called Discount Store Modern . He fell on his  | knees in front of it and yanked at the third drawer . It came halfway out , then jigged sideways in its slot and stuck firmly . " Goddam you , " he whispered at it . His face was dead pale except for the spots of dark , bloody color flaring in each cheek and his blue eyes , which looked as dark as Atlantic storm-clouds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard that the entire dresser tottered forward and almost fell on him before deciding to settle back . The drawer shot all the way out and landed in Todd 's lap . Dussander 's socks and underwear and handkerchiefs spilled out all around him . He pawed through the stuff that was still in the drawer and came up with a wooden box about nine inches long and three inches deep . He tried to pull up the lid . Nothing happened . It was locked , just as Dussander had said . Nothing was free tonight . He stuffed the spilled clothes back into the drawer and then rammed the drawer back into its oblong slot . It stuck again . Todd worked to free it , wiggling it back and forth , sweat running freely down his face . At last he was able to slam it shut . He got up with the box . How much time had passed now ? Dussander 's bed was the type with posts at the foot and Todd brought the lock side of the box down on one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock of pain that vibrated in his hands and travelled all the way up to his elbows . He looked at the lock . The lock looked a bit dented , but it was intact . He brought it down on the post again , even harder this time , heedless of the pain . This time a chunk of wood flew off the bedpost , but the lock still did n't give . Todd uttered a little shriek of laughter and took the box to the other end of the bed . He raised it high over his head this time and brought it down with all his strength . This time the lock splintered . As he flipped the lid up , headlights splashed across Dussander 's window . He pawed wildly through the box . Postcards . A locket . A much-folded picture of a woman wearing frilly black garters and nothing else . An old billfold . Several sets of ID . An empty ! eat lice passport folder . At the bottom , letters . The lights grew brighter , and now he heard the distinctive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and then cut off .  | Todd grabbed three sheets of airmail-type stationery , closely written in German on both sides of each sheet , and ran out of the room again . He had almost gotten to the stairs when he realized he had left the forced box lying on Dussander 's bed . He ran back , grabbed it , and opened the third dresser drawer . It stuck again , this time with a firm shriek of wood against wood . Out front , he heard the ratchet of the Porsche 's emergency brake , the opening of the driver 's side door , the slam shut . Faintly , Todd could hear himself moaning . He put the box in the askew drawer , stood up , and lashed out at it with his foot . The drawer closed neatly . He stood blinking at it for a moment and then fled back down the hall . He raced down the stairs . Halfway down them , he heard the rapid rattle of his father 's shoes on Dussander 's walk . Todd vaulted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , the airmail pages fluttering from his hand . A hammering on the door . " Todd ? Todd , it 's me ! " And he could hear an ambulance siren in the distance as well . Dussander had drifted away into semi-consciousness again . " Coming , Dad ! " Todd shouted . He put the airmail pages on the table , fanning them a little as if they had been dropped in a hurry , and then he went back down the hall and let his father in . " Where is he ? " Dick Bowden asked , shouldering past Todd . " In the kitchen . " " You did everything just right , Todd , " his father said , and hugged him in a rough , embarrassed way . " I just hope I remembered everything , " Todd said modestly , and then followed his father down the hall and into the kitchen . In the rush to get Dussander out of the house , the letter was almost completely ignored . Todd 's father picked it up briefly , then put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Todd and his father followed the ambulance , and his explanation of what had happened was accepted without question by the doctor attending Dussander 's case . " Mr. Denker " was , after all , eighty years old , and his habits were not the best . The doctor also offered Todd a brusque commendation for his quick thinking and action . Todd thanked him wanly and then asked his father if they could go home .  | As they rode back , Dick told him again how proud of him he was . Todd barely heard him . He was thinking about his .30-.30 again . 18 That was the same day Morris Heisel broke his back . Morris had never intended to break his back ; all he had intended to do was nail up the corner of the rain-gutter on the west side of his house . Breaking his back was the furthest thing from his mind , he had had enough grief in his life without that , thank you very much . His first wife had died at the age of twenty-five , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead , killed in a tragic car accident not far from Disneyland in 1971 . Morris himself was nearing sixty , and had a case of arthritis that was worsening early and fast . He also had warts on both hands , warts that seemed to grow back as fast as the doctor could burn them off . He was also prone to migraine headaches , and in the last couple of years , that potzer Rogan next door had taken to calling him " Morris the Cat . " Morris had wondered aloud to Lydia , his second wife , how Rogan would like it if Morris took up calling him " Rogan the hemorrhoid . " " Quit it , Morris , " Lydia said on these occasions . " You ca n't take a joke , you never could take a joke , sometimes I wonder how I could marry a man with absolutely no sense of humor . We go to Las Vegas , " Lydia had said , addressing the empty kitchen as if an invisible horde of spectators which only she could see were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris does n't laugh once . " Besides arthritis , warts , and migraines , Morris also had Lydia , who , God love her , had developed into something of a nag over the last five years or so . . . ever since her hysterectomy . So he had plenty of sorrows and plenty of problems without adding a broken back . " Morris ! " Lydia cried , coming to the back door and wiping suds from her hands with a dishtowel . " Morris , you come down off that ladder right now ! " " What ? " He twisted his head so he could see her . He was almost  | at the top of his aluminum stepladder . There was a bright yellow sticker on this step which said : DANGER ! BALANCE MAY SHIFT WITHOUT WARNING ABOVE THIS STEP ! Morris was wearing his carpenter 's apron with the wide pockets , one of the pockets filled with nails and the other filled with heavy-duty staples . The ground under the stepladder 's feet was slightly uneven and the ladder rocked a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelude to one of his migraines . He was out of temper . " What ? " " Come down from there , I said , before you break your back . " " I 'm almost finished . " " You 're rocking on that ladder like you were on a boat , Morris . Come down . " " I 'll come down when I 'm done ! " he said angrily . " Leave me alone ! " " You 'll break your back , " she reiterated dolefully , and went into the house again . Ten minutes later , as he was hammering the last nail into the rain-gutter , tipped back nearly to the point of overbalancing , he heard a feline yowl followed by fierce barking . " What in God 's name ? ? " He looked around and the stepladder rocked alarmingly . At that same moment , their cat  --  it was named Lover Boy , not Morris ? tore around the corner of the garage , its fur bushed out into hackles and its green eyes flaring . The Rogans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging out and its leash dragging behind it . Lover Boy , apparently not superstitious , ran under the stepladder . The collie pup followed . " Look out , look out , you dumb mutt ! " Morris shouted . The ladder rocked . The pup bunted it with the side of its body . The ladder tipped over and Morris tipped with it , uttering a howl of dismay . Nails and staples flew out of his carpenter 's apron . He landed half on and half off the concrete driveway , and a gigantic agony flared in his back . He did not so much hear his spine snap as feel it happen . Then the world grayed out for awhile . When things swam back into focus , he was still lying half on and  | half off the driveway in a litter of nails and staples . Lydia was kneeling over him , weeping . Rogan from next door was there , too , his face as white as a shroud . " I told you ! " Lydia babbled . " I told you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at this ! " Morris found he had absolutely no desire to look . A suffocating , throbbing band of pain had cinched itself around his middle like a belt , and that was bad , but there was something much worse : he could feel nothing below that belt of pain  --  nothing at all . " Wail later , " he said huskily . " Call the doctor now . " " I 'll do it , " Rogan said , and ran back to his own house . " Lydia , " Morris said . He wet his lips . " What ? What , Morris ? " She bent over him and a tear splashed on his cheek . It was touching , he supposed , but it had made him flinch , and the flinch had made the pain worse . " Lydia , I also have one of my migraines . " " Oh , poor darling ! Poor Morris ! But I told you ? " " I 've got the headache because that potter Rogan 's dog barked all night and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocks over my ladder and I think my back is broken . " Lydia shrieked . The sound made Morris 's head vibrate . " Lydia , " he said , and wet his lips again . " What , darling ? " " I have suspected something for many years . Now I am sure . " " My poor Morris ! What ? " " There is no God , " Morris said , and fainted . They took him to Santo Donato and his doctor told him , at about the same time that he would have ordinarily been sitting down to one of Lydia 's wretched suppers , that he would never walk again . ! Uy then they had put him in a body-cast . Blood and urine samples had been taken . Dr. Kemmelman had peered into his eyes and tapped his knees with a little rubber hammer  --  but no reflexive twitch of the leg answered the taps . And at every turn there was Lydia , the tears streaming from her eyes , as she used up one handkerchief after another . Lydia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Job , went everywhere well-supplied with little lace snotrags , just to case reason for an extended crying spell should occur . She had called  | her mother , and her mother would be here soon ( " That 's nice , Lydia " ? although if there was anyone on earth Morris honestly loathed , it was Lydia 's mother ) . She had called the rabbi , he would be here soon , too ( " That 's nice , Lydia " ? although he had n't set foot inside the synagogue in five years and was n't sure what the rabbi 's name was ) . She had called his boss , and while he would n't be here soon , he sent his greatest sympathies and condolences ( " That 's nice , Lydia " ? although if there was anyone in a class with Lydia 's mother , it was that cigar-chewing putz Frank Haskell ) . At last they gave Morris a Valium and took Lydia away . Shortly afterward , Morris just drifted away  --  no worries , no migraine , no nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , went his last thought , he would go on up that stepladder and break his back again . When he woke up  --  or regained consciousness , that was more like it  --  dawn was just breaking and the hospital was as quiet as Morris supposed it ever got . He felt very calm . . . almost serene . He had no pain ; his body felt swaddled and weightless . His bed had been surrounded by some sort of contraption like a squirrel cage  --  a thing of stainless steel bars , guy wires , and pulleys . His legs were being held up by cables attached to this gadget . His back seemed to be bowed by something beneath , but it was hard to tell  --  he had only the angle of his vision to judge by . Others have it worse , he thought . All over the world , others have it worse . In Israel , the Palestinians kill busloads of farmers who were committing the political crime of going into town to see a movie . The Israelis cope with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with whatever terrorists may be there . Others have it worse than me ... which is not to say this is good , do n't get that idea , but of/hers have it worse . l lc lifted one hand with some effort  --  there was pain somewhere in his body , but it was very faint  --  and made a weak fist in front of his eyes . There . Nothing wrong with his hands . Nothing wrong with his arms , either . So he could n't feel anything below the waist , a , what ? There were people all over the world paralyzed from the nnk down . There were people with leprosy . There were people
