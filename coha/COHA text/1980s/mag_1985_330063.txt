A major university engages a study group to evaluate its operations . The result ? Something earnest but tepid , un- likely to startle anyone , right ? Not if it is the State University of New York . Last week a 15-member commission , appointed by Chancellor Clifton R. Wharton Jr . to examine the largest U.S. public university system ( 370,000 students ) , issued a report that called SUNY " an extreme example of what not to do in the management of public higher education . " The report declared that SUNY is " the most overregulated university in the nation . " The commission blamed the university 's charter , which set up SUNY 36 years ago to function as a state agency , like New York 's prisons , rather than as a quasi-independent entity , the status of institutions like the University of California . <P> Largely as a consequence , SUNY 's trustees and the heads of its 64 campuses have lacked the authority to build a first-class university . Even Chancellor Wharton can not shift a secretarial position or substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget . Tuition money is bled away to pay off old construction debts . And there is not enough new money to lure crack faculty or beef up the graduate curriculum . Under the dead hand of such regulations , continues the report , SUNY is " well behind " other major public universities in research and graduate education . <P> To move the university into the front rank , the commission , whose co- chairmen are Ralph Davidson , chairman of the board of Time Inc. , and Harold Enarson , president emeritus of Ohio State University , makes 29 recommendations . The key one is " to restructure SUNY as a public benefit corporation . " By this concept SUNY would become a semi-independent state body , with funds allocated in block grants , under control of the trustees . New construction would be paid for by additional state revenues . Thus SUNY 's administrators would presumably have their hands free and enough money to run the store . <P> First reactions from Albany legislators were supportive . Mark Siegel , chairman of the assembly 's higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " Mickey Mouse red-tape controls . " Although he was not sure the only solution was a new structure , Siegel added , " if it takes a public benefit corporation to achieve decentralization and flexibility , then that is what we 'll do .
