This is the latest marketing ploy in the $100 million-a-year world of kiddie cosmetics . <P> Is Danielle intended to be the Brooke Shields of the preteen crowd ? Absolutely not , protests Martin K. Greenfield , president of New Jersey-based Tom Fields , Ltd. , which makes Tinkerbell products . Danielle , he contends , is more wholesome than sexy .

" We would prefer that the parents make the decisions on what to buy , " says Greenfield . The commercials featuring Danielle will appear only on adult soap operas and game shows and not on cartoon programs .
