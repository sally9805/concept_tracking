Columbia 's new mission is aborted 31 seconds before lift-off <P> Two days before blastoff , preparations for the second launching of the space shuttle Columbia were " just going bang , bang , bang , " according to Deke Slayton , manager of NASA 's shuttle test program . Things were running so far ahead of schedule , in fact , that most workers at the Kennedy Space Center were given a morning off . Even the astronauts , Air Force Colonel Joe H. Engle , 49 , and Navy Captain Richard H. <P> Truly , 44 this week , would have time for " goofing off , " Slayton noted . As a crowd of half a million gathered at Cape Canaveral , the only apparent clouds on the horizon were the clouds on the horizon-an Atlantic storm that could pose a landing problem should the mission have to abort . But the go-ahead was given and the final countdown begun . Only in its last nine minutes did the mechanical elements start to bluster . <P> At T-minus-nine minutes , a slight drop in liquid-oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in one of three oxygen tanks carried aboard the orbiter . Flight Director Neil Hutchinson at Mission Control in Houston stopped the countdown and consulted other technicians . The problem did not seem serious . Pressure in the tanks could be adjusted by warming the oxygen with on-board heaters . Ground computers guiding the launch were instructed to ignore the pressure drop , and the countdown continued . <P> Next , a loss of pressure was recorded in a second on-board tank . Again , the computers were told to proceed . But when the third tank registered the same problem , only 40 seconds remained before lift off . Before the computers could be redirected , they had shut down the launch at T-minus-31 seconds . <P> " It was a race between finger time and electronic time , " said NASA Spokesman Rocky Raab . " Electronics won . " <P> Mission Control resolved to try again , but a new mechanical storm cloud soon appeared . Two oil filters , closely resembling the ones used in automobiles , had become clogged with gunk . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices crucial to entering orbit and landing-were questionable . <P> The trouble was not unfamiliar . " We have had a history of contaminants clogging the system , " admitted a technician at Kennedy . NASA engineers had even included a bypass around the oil filters just in case . Such clogging is usually caused by a leak in liquid hydrazine , the auxiliary power units ' fuel . Hydrazine reacts with lubricating oil to form waxy polymers , or gunk . Despite this hazard , prelaunch preparations did not include an oil change ; the two jammed systems were running on the same oil used in last April 's shuttle mission . Significantly , the oil in the one working system was fresh . <P> At week 's end , NASA officials rescheduled the launch for this Thursday after determining that the oil systems were in working order . This was scant consolation to the Detroit News . A front-page story headlined COLUMBIA DOES AN ENCORE appeared in some of last Wednesday 's editions , describing the " perfect launch " in glowing detail . This week with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA might get it right .
