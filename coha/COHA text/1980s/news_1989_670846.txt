Then , in celebration of their own grace and grit , these baseball lovers and earthquake survivors sang together the song most emblematic of this city ' s indomitable recovery from the quake and fire of 1906 : <> <> San Francisco , open your Golden Gate . <> You let no stranger wait long at yourdoor . <> San Francisco , here is your wand ' ring one <> Saying I ' ll wander no more. // The ceremonial first pitches tonight were thrown not by celebrities but by earthquake heroes , because this third World Series game between the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics had become more a civic celebration than an athletic event. // Among the 12 who were recognized were Steve Whipple , the rescue worker who spotted Buck Helm alive in the wreckage of the Nimitz Freeway , and Jerry Shannon , a firefighter who refused to abandon a woman in the rubble of San Francisco ' s Marina district. // These were the somber moments , but soon the throaty cheers of a hometown baseball crowd filled Candlestick Park. // There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quake scared some people away . But the stands were nearly full by the time the Giants took the field , and soon the grief and anxiety of the past 10 days were almost forgotten as the game unfolded . In a disappointing night for the home team , the A ' s won 13 to 7 ; they now lead the Series 3 games to 0 . <> <> A Communal Experience // Bent but not broken , eager for recovery and proud of their pluck , these men , women and children had returned to the stadium for a communal experience that millions more , no doubt , will later claim to have been part of. // The yearly reunion of the 1906 earthquake survivors , at the only fire hydrant that worked during that disaster , now attracts a small group of elderly San Franciscans , stiff-limbed and hard of hearing. // The gathering today , by contrast , drew tens of thousands , young and old , their memories fresh and their heads still light from the jolt that rocked the region on Oct. 17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Same place , same time , but it feels about three years later , " said Hildy Bernstein of Santa Cruz , who said her house still stands but is a shambles . She had begged her 10-year-old son , Noah , to skip the game , and tried unsuccessfully to bribe him with a bicycle . So they were here , though jittery . Mrs. Bernstein ' s hand-lettered T-shirt said , " I Was Crazy Enough to Come Back. " // While much of what happened tonight was familiar - the cracking of bats and the World Series bunting decorating the stadium - much of it was unlike any other game in history. // A public address announcer softly warned fans entering the ball park not to panic in the event of earthquake aftershocks . If one occurred , they were told , they should listen to announcements that would continue with the aid of a a diesel-powered generator that did not exist here on Oct. 17. // Ushers carried flashlights ; scores of extra police officers walked the aisles , offering gentle reassurances . <> <> Barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stadium that gradually filled with donated canned goods and blankets to aid the thousands of people from here to Watsonville who have been displaced by the quake. // Lines at souvenir stands were unusually long as fans bought pieces of history : T-shirts , saying " Bay Bridge World Series , when the bridge for now is split in the middle , " or commemorative envelopes with a postmark of Oct. 17. // No place in the stadium more epitomized the strangeness than did Section 53 , a dizzying perch in the upper deck. // There , a week ago Tuesday , joints on the stadium ' s concrete canopy separated wide enough to show the sky , and the stairs split open underfoot. // Today , assured that the joints did just what they were supposed to , fans climbed the repaired steps to their seats , 150 feet above the field . Some said they wanted to be here to put their fears behind them ; others said being at the ball game was a way of proclaiming that life was back to normal . <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the earthquake on television thought San Francisco had fallen into the bay , " said Richard Duran , a computer programming engineer sitting in Section 53 . " Well , the next two or three nights they ' ll get a chance to see we ' re still here. " // Still , there were reminders of the vulnerability that is a fact of life in the Bay Area . A sign on the upper deck said : " Earth bats last. " // In the parking lot hours before game time , many fans had set up barbecue grills for tailgate parties and were cooking hamburgers , hot dogs and sausages and drinking beer. // " I ' ve got to do it , " said Debby Clary , who was grilling hamburgers for her family , all Giants fans . " It ' s got nothing to do with seeing them win . We have a season ticket package for next year and if I don ' t come now , I won ' t come back . " <> <> For Protection : Hard Hats // Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of humor . Many were wearing construction hard hats decorated in the Giants ' black and orange colors as they began gathering in the parking lot on a breezy , bright afternoon. // Phil Castagnola , a computer engineer , had modified the sticker on his hat so the Giants ' slogan , ' I feel good , ' read , ' I feel safe. ' // " I have no reservations at all , " he said of returning to the stadium . " I ' m glad to see the ' Stick made it through the whole ordeal. " // Dan Duffy , an accountant , explained that he wore a hard hat because " I ' m right at the edge of the overhang , so I ' ve got to be prepared. " // Stuart Burchard , a real estate agent , said he was there because he paid $600 for his ticket behind the Oakland dugout . <> <> The Mood Had Changed // But a number of fans pointed to the big stretches of empty spaces in the parking areas and said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earthquake. // " Last time it was a three-ring circus , " said George Ericson . " This looks like a regular ball game . " He said the mood had changed since the earthquake . " The World Series has lost its thrill , " he said . " People have sort of put this on the back burner . If it wasn ' t for my son , I wouldn ' t have come out here today . To the kids the World Series is still something. " // John Holbook , a Tahoe City roofer who was in the parking lot when the quake struck , said , " It ' s fun to be back and it ' s good to see the stadium standing . " He said that during the 15 seconds the quake lasted , " we had enough time to look at it and say , ' Is this going to stand ? ' " // Jim Wedell , a financial planner from Redwood City , said his mother was afraid to go back into the stadium and had returned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could have sold them in two minutes . " He said he could not see any evidence of the damage to the structure . " I was looking for some cracks earlier . I couldn ' t see any . Can you imagine all that concrete moving like Jell-O ? You could tell this was a local crowd , they enjoyed it and didn ' t freak out . " <> <> Not Many ' Texas Whoops ' // Chet Crussee , a limousine driver for the artist LeRoy Neiman on the night of the quake and again today , said he found the crowd quieter today. // " There ' s no smell of food in the air , " he said . " It ' s real quiet . Ten days ago , people were saying , ' Go Giants . ' There were a lot of Texas whoops . You ' re not hearing a lot of that today. " // Ken Turturici , an auto painter from San Mateo , said he recalled the quake as being " like riding a roller coaster ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking forward to returning to the stadium . " We want to see a World Series , " he said. // But Ruth O ' Dell did not see it that way . " Quite frankly , I ' d rather be home because I ' m still scared , " she said . " If my husband is going to take a chance , I ' m going to go , but I ' m worried about it. " // " We ' re afraid , " agreed Janice Lane . " The men are too . They just won ' t admit it. ' // Robert Guillermo , a San Franciso police officer working outside the stadium , said he was glad the Series was resuming . " The city needs it , " he said . " It breaks the monotony . Everyone is tired of hearing about the destruction . The majority want to go ahead ; otherwise they wouldn ' t be here. " // His partner , Allan Lim , was not so sure. // " A lot of homes still don ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s big business for these people . Major League Baseball makes a lot of money on this . They have a financial commitment . But there are still people who have lost their homes , still people living in shelters . For them , it may not be appropriate. " //
