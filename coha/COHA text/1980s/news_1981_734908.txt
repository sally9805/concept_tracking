txt THE DISTANT drumbeat of war signals a banner year for the aerospace industry . That , in effect , was the assessment last week of Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine , a publication widely viewed as an authoritative monitor of aerospace trends . It said a big part of the industry 's business this year will be due to the extra $26 billion President Reagan wants to add to the Defense Department budget in fiscal 1082 . Fiscal 1982 begins Oct. 1 , 1981 . " U.S. aerospace company sales are forecast to top $57.8 billion this year , " said the magazine , only to per cent less than the worth of all new cars sold in this country in 19110 . Next year , sales " will climb to $71 billion and in 1983 pass $80 billion .

The country will spend $8 billion on missiles in 1981 and perhaps $11.5 billion in 1982 . ? Sales of commercial transports , by comparison , will be down this year to $10 billion from a peak of $10.5 billion in 1980 , with a sharp drop to $0.8 billion seen in 1982 .

" Both of them had poor eartOtigs in 19110 on rising sales , but they should show good improvement in 1981 and 1982 " buena ; of military biisiness , Fried said . Military sales will also help the U.S. balance of payments .
