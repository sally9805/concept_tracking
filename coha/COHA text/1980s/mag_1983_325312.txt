A Marine takes a stand , as U.S.-Israeli tensions rise <P> As three Israeli tanks approached a U.S. Marine position near the old Sidon road to the south of Beirut , Captain Charles B. Johnson , 30 , of Neenah , Wis. , did not hesitate . He ran toward the heavily armored , British-made Centurions , then took a position in the middle of the road . When the lead tank halted barely a foot in front of him , Johnson told an Israeli lieutenant colonel atop it , " You will not pass through this position . " <P> After a momentary pause , the Israeli commander dismounted , talked with Johnson , remounted his tank and declared , according to Johnson , " I am going through . " Johnson again demanded that the tanks halt , adding , " If you come through , it will be over my dead body . " He drew his pistol and held it at a 45 angle , the " ready " position . After another pause , during which the Israelis spoke over their radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside it . <P> Then , suddenly , the other two tanks took off at full speed in the original direction . Johnson jumped on the lead tank , grabbed the Israeli commander and yelled at him to stop his tanks . Complying at last , the Israeli , who was subsequently identified only as a Lieut . Colonel " Rafi , " told Johnson , " One thing we do n't want to do is shoot each other . " Replied Johnson : " Yes , but if you keep doing things like this , the likelihood is going to increase . " <P> The incident was the most serious in a rising tide of tension between the U.S. and Israeli forces in Lebanon since the Marines landed five months ago , with French and Italian troops , as part of an international peace-keeping effort . Indeed , the entire three-nation force seemed under siege last week . A grenade was tossed into a French military vehicle in West Beirut , wounding one soldier . Several French soldiers out jogging were sprayed by automatic weapons fire ; two were wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence in West Beirut in recent months , a car bomb blew up outside the Palestine Research Center and the temporary Libyan embassy , turning both buildings into infernos . At least 20 people were killed and 70 wounded . <P> For the 1,200 U.S. Marines in Lebanon , the problems have been with the Israelis . Several times in the past month , Israeli units tried to pass Marine checkpoints , in violation of the peace-keeping agreement , and each time were turned back . In order to end such confrontations , the Marines and the Israelis two weeks ago set up a radio " hot line " and tried to agree to certain lines of demarcation between their forces . But some U.S. officials in Beirut remained convinced that the Israeli moves last month , as well as recent Israeli charges that the Marines were failing to stop " terrorists " from passing through Marine positions , were part of an Israeli strategy . Its purpose : to discredit the Marines , as well as the French and Italian forces , and to reinforce the argument that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been withdrawn from the rest of the country , should be retained by the Israelis .
