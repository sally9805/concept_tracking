Though it was not , of course , a requirement for the assignment , to a man and woman those involved in preparing this week 's cover story on the growing problem of tax evasion declare themselves to be meticulous compilers with Internal Revenue Service rules . More surprisingly , and undeniably an asset in their tasks on the project , most also said that they calculated their own taxes , filed their own returns , and struggled valiantly with the quirks and variations of the law . Says Washington Correspondent David Beckwith , who prepares his own forms : " I took two courses in taxation at law school , and I try to keep abreast of major tax developments . Still , I 'm one of those fools who overwithholds and gives the Government an interest-free loan of my money . I 'm happy though-I got my refund two weeks ago . " Los Angeles Reporter Laura Meyers ' returns , she says , get ever more complicated : " This year I had to fill out a 1040 , a Schedule C for business proprietor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D for I ca n't even remember what . But I find that if I read everything line by line twice through , O.K. , maybe three times , I can eventually figure it out . " <P> Chicago Reporter Thomas McCarroll is waiting to file till the last possible moment : " April 15 at 11:58 p.m. , " he vows . " I want to keep my money as long as possible . " Reporter-Researcher JoAnn Lum , who assisted Senior Writer Otto Friedrich with the cover story , will also delay filing till deadline time : " I hate it , " she says , " so I always procrastinate . " Another reporter-researcher who worked on the cover story was Sidney Urquhart ; she and her husband , with two jobs and six children between them , find the services of an accountant helpful , as does New York Correspondent Adam Zagorin . <P> Zagorin , who interviewed agents in the city 's regional IRS office , tax compliance monitors and criminal tax lawyers , also talked with observers of , and participants in , New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zagorin thinks he has special expertise : he was assigned for 1 years to the TIME bureau in Beirut , where tax collection has become highly informal . " Few official taxes are collected in Lebanon even now , " reports Zagorin , " only the unofficial taxes demanded by various parties , factions and militias and collected from underground and above-ground enterprises . It is an illegal but organized system . " Far more so than in New York City , says Zagorin , noting that it is teeming with underground operators : " Many of them , one must assume , are not reporting their income . Oddly enough , in Manhattan , the street vendors now even surround IRS headquarters . "
