" Blue , " he explains , " because this color does not exist on the earth 's surface . " Despite impressive credentials - Verame had already festooned a dried riverbed in France and a mile of the Corsican coast-it took the artist two years to persuade authorities to let him undertake his " mad dream .

Police , a clergyman and a psychologist tried for two hours to talk him out of jumping , but to no avail . In short , this looked like a job for Muhammad Ali .

Moments after being summoned , the former heavyweight champ arrived in his personal emergency vehicle-a two-tone brown Rolls-Royce-lights flashing .
