But though a calm has settled over The Voice ' s cluttered headquarters in the East Village , just beneath the surface lie strongly clashing visions among staff members of what The Voice should be as it begins operations under the weekly newspaper ' s fifth owner. // Many on the staff are eager for change as The Voice nears the end of its 30th year , with profits reportedly strong but readership stagnant among those 24 years old and younger. // " We need someone to come in and treat The Voice like an Oriental rug and shake the dust out , " said Jan Hoffman , a staff writer . <> <> First Priority // According to a 1984 survey by the Scarborough Research Corporation , which does market research , the paper ' s readers are getting older . David Schneiderman , the publisher and editor in chief of The Voice , said his first priority as publisher was to " make sure we don ' t lose our younger readers. " // According to Mr. Schneiderman , a different survey commissioned by The Voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of film , music and politics , in that order , with other subjects generating smaller demand . New coverage of business , science and medicine , he said , are " subjects I hope to go into within six months. " // According to the Scarborough survey , 25 percent of the newspaper ' s readers live in Manhattan , with Brooklyn and Queens second and third . The Audit Bureau of Circulation ' s report of March 31 lists The Voice ' s circulation at 151 , 000. // The Scarborough survey reported that about half of The Voice ' s readers were single and had never been married , and Mr. Schneiderman said this unusually high percentage reflected the paper ' s large homosexual readership. // Since 1980 , according to the survey , The Voice has attracted a higher percentage of black , Hispanic and other minority readers , which now represent 31 percent of its audience , and more than 60 percent of the readers are male . <> <> Battling Factions // Factions within The Voice , the best-established and one of the oldest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since January for primacy as the paper searched for a new top editor. // In January , Mr. Schneiderman , who had been the editor , accepted the publisher ' s position at the paper but continued to serve as interim editor in chief while a new editor was sought. // The decision this spring by its publisher , Rupert Murdoch , to sell The Voice prompted a new round of infighting in an atmosphere made all the more explosive by uncertainty over who the new owner would be , according to many staff members. // The worst of the uncertainty ended on June 20 when Leonard Stern , the multimillionaire owner of Hartz Mountain Industries , a New Jersey company that makes pet products , paid more than $55 million for The Voice and pledged not to interfere with its editorial affairs. // Mr. Stern , who describes himself as a liberal on civil rights and social issues and as right of center on defense issues , said he would not step in even if Voice writers attacked him in the paper , as they did Mr. Murdoch , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London and other papers . <> <> ' A Business Decision ' // Mr. Stern described the Voice purchase , which he said did not require borrowing money , as " not an extension of my ego or political beliefs but very much a business decision. " // Though he noted that he has been an infrequent reader of the newspaper since his college days at New York University , he said that he " loved the Village Voice. " // As a demonstration of his satisfaction with both the newspaper ' s profitability and current editorial direction , Mr. Stern invited Mr. Schneiderman to retain both the editor and publisher titles . Industry analysts estimate that The Voice has annual profits of $5 million before taxes , but no financial or advertising-linage data are issued for the paper. // On Tuesday , Mr. Schneiderman agreed to keep both titles , somewhat to the dismay of some of the paper ' s staff members , who felt that the two positions should not be held by the same person. // Because a publisher ' s fundamental responsibility is the financial well-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep their news judgments independent of business considerations. // But though the issue of who will provide the top editorial leadership has been settled , the warring factions remain , and the way The Voice will evolve is unresolved . <> <> Traditional Emphasis // In broad terms , one of the newspaper ' s factions outspokenly defends the newspaper ' s traditional emphasis on politics . This group fights giving front-page play and generous space to softer subjects such as rock music and the eating habits of young urban professionals , or yuppies. // The other group denounces the paper ' s political coverage as dull and predictable and says the paper ' s political writers hog the coveted space in the newspaper ' s front section that should include more articles on modern culture and social issues such as feminism and homosexual rights. // But in one respect almost all staff members agree : editors , essentially , should not edit , and reporters have the right to say anything they want in their articles without the constraint of objectivity and balance in news coverage that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Village Voice columnists and writers is to take strong political positions , usually of the left , and carry on concerted attacks on individuals and institutions they dislike . One of their favorite targets is The New York Times. // " We are not objective reporters , we don ' t pretend that , " said Mr. Schneiderman , whose muscle as editor in chief lies mostly in his power to choose what will be touted on the front page and how much space an article will be given , rather than in editing the articles that appear. // Mr. Schneiderman , who is 38 years old , says The Voice as an advocacy newspaper is not looking for balance but is fair in that it considers and includes opposing arguments . The Voice , he says , is " aggressive , edgy and fearless. " // But some critics of The Voice fault the paper for being fearless without a corresponding concern for accuracy. // " In its early days , The Voice was a place where people had the freedom to write what they want , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Howard Blum , a former reporter for The Voice and The New York Times who has written a soon-to-be published novel about a newspaper " not unlike The Voice. " // " But , " Mr. Blum added , " over the years , that freedom has been bashed around by careless reporters who didn ' t care about truth at all , but just points of view . " <> <> ' Writing Essays ' // According to present and former Voice staff members , the rigor of checking facts and selecting what facts are used in articles is left almost entirely to the discretion of the writer. // " In many cases they are writing essays and selecting the facts to support a point of view , and they say the other side is represented in other newspapers , " said Cynthia Crossen , a former managing editor of The Voice who left last year to become an editor at The Wall Street Journal. // Since The Voice ' s first issue in October 1955 , its unrestrained and opinionated writing has been the paper ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fill its columns with their words. // Over the years , The Voice has scored some journalistic coups , such as its early coverage of the financial affairs of Bert Lance , then the director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter . The paper ' s coverage of the dangers of lead paint have drawn critical praise , and in 1981 , Teresa Carpenter , a Voice staff writer , was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing based on crime reporting . <> <> The Experimental and New // The Voice devotes a great deal of space to the coverage and criticism of the more avant-garde dimensions of music , film and other cultural areas , and the paper has been a force in nurturing the experimental and new. // For example , Andrew Sarris , The Voice ' s longtime movie critic , is credited by many with being a very important factor in the popularization of avant-garde films. // But critics of the paper , who include both friends and enemies of its political positions , say that what was once fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become polemical and predictable in its radical-to-liberal perspective on almost every issue. // Though The Village Voice ' s political coverage commands a certain following , local politicians and political scientists say it has lost much of its power to surprise and with it much of its power to influence the opinions of others. // " I don ' t think The Voice influences the making of policy or judgments made by politicians , " said Edward L. Sadowsky , the chairman of the New York City Council ' s Finance Committee , who added that the newspaper has generally been kind to him. // " On the other hand , " he said , " their role is essential because what they do is tweak noses . " <> <> Some Surprising Views // But while some staff members say Voice articles are often too long and often predictable , they note that the paper ' s writers still sometimes surprise each other with their views . For instance , Mr. Hentoff has expressed sympathy and support for those opposed to abortion , a position unlike that of most on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative coverage in The Voice than has Mayor Koch , who has not granted the paper an interview in many years. // Some of The Voice ' s readers say they perceive an anti-Israel bias in the newspaper . Staff members say the paper has many writers and articles that could be considered pro-Israel , and they suggest that the perception may have sprung from the writing of Alexander Cockburn , a strong critic of Israel. // Mr. Cockburn was dismissed in 1984 by Mr. Schneiderman for accepting a $10 , 000 grant from the Institute of Arab Studies , a now-defunct research organization , to write a book on the Israeli invasion of Lebanon . Mr. Schneiderman termed it a conflict of interest and said at the time that Mr. Cockburn had " damaged the credibility " of The Voice , while Mr. Cockburn characterized the reaction as " pompous hand-wringing. " // The original owners of The Voice , Dan Wolf and Ed Fancher , sold it in 1971 to Carter Burden and Bartle Bull , who , in turn , sold it to Clay Felker in 1974. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bitter dissension at the newspaper has its roots in the Felker period , when Mr. Felker tried to move The Voice from a heavily political newspaper to one that gave more emphasis to life styles and trends . <> <> Threats of a Walkout // With Mr. Murdoch ' s purchase of The Voice in 1977 , the staff was united against a common enemy . When Mr. Murdoch tried to dismiss The Voice ' s editor soon after acquiring the paper , there were threats of a mass walkout by staff members and he backed down. // Two years later , Mr. Schneiderman left The New York Times , where he was assistant editor of the Op-Ed page , to become editor in chief of The Voice , but only after his appointment was delayed several months at the insistence of The Voice ' s staff until the former editor , Marianne Partridge , finished her contracted term as editor. // Because there were - and are - so many competing factions at the paper , Mr. Schneiderman adopted a policy of not socializing with anyone , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle is largely between the paper ' s political writers and the groups identified by staff members as the " sexual-politicos , " whose political interests are oriented toward social issues , and the " artsy-intellectuals , " who include the more culture-oriented staff members . <> <> Fierce Arguments // For months , fierce arguments have erupted almost weekly over what articles should be given prominent display . And the arguments sometimes have found their way into print , with staff members denouncing each other in The Voice . Mr. Hentoff , for example , has traded barbs with Karen Durbin , a senior editor , over the abortion issue. // Such exchanges are part of the Voice tradition , but recent exchanges were considered to be particularly angry . The atmosphere became so charged that most of those in the newsroom would not speak to the others , according to staff members. // The frosty newsroom climate , which persists , prompted one staff member to place a memo in everyone ' s mailbox last Monday suggesting that , in this time of dealing with a new owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " In fact , " the memo said , " maybe we can say ' Hello , ' a quite revolutionary leap forward in this joint.
