Feinstein faces a recall vote <P> When San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein last summer got the board of supervisors to pass an ordinance to outlaw most handguns in the city , she was predictably the target of potshots from the right . The local political left , of course , was generally pleased with the antigun crusade of the moderate mayor . But not all factions on the left : more determinedly upset than any of the conservative gun groups was the White Panther Party , a ragtag tribe of about a dozen communards encamped in an electric-blue town house in-yes-the Haight-Ashbury district . The Panthers were formed in the 1960s , and they still adhere to a position popular with the far left in that frenzied time : revolutionaries need weapons . <P> The present Panthers did not waste time with ' 60s-style protests and sloganeering : last month they blind-sided the city by turning in petitions signed by 35,000 people that called for the ouster of Mayor Feinstein . That was more than enough signatures to force only the second mayoral recall election in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled for April 26 . Feinstein and her aides fear that even if she survives the recall vote , she could suffer politically in the regular quadrennial election coming up in November . Two-thirds of the voters are Democrats , as is Feinstein , who took office in 1978 after the handgun murder of Mayor George Moscone ; the next year she won the popular election .

Last month the state supreme court declined to overturn a lower court ruling that the measure violated California 's constitution . By that time , however , the recall petition had become a grievance catchall . Feinstein , 49 , though widely regarded as bright and hard working , has alienated various constituent groups . In December she vetoed an ordinance , backed by the city 's substantial homosexual population , that would have given unmarried couples , even those of the same sex , many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both critical of her housing policies . Says Feinstein : " You can get people to sign a petition for an overhead sewer line on Market Street . " The recall , wrote Journalist Warren Hinckle in the Los Angeles Times , " has reinforced San Francisco 's reputation as a tree house for adult delinquents. "
