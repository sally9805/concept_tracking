Pick up an old novel by one of the Russian masters or a new memoir by a Soviet dissident and notice how people introduce themselves  --  last names first . " Good day , I am Scriabin , Alexander Nikolayevich . " Notice too how often , perhaps in rebellion against those cumbrous Russian patronymics , they use only their initials . " Good day , I am Scriabin , A.N . " The title of a French movie made a few years back , Lacombe , Lucien , was apparently intended to show how the German Occupation had bureaucratized and dehumanized the susceptible French . But the Russians do not have their reversed names imposed on them ; they seem to reverse them freely on their own . Perhaps that is always the way with dehumanization ; we willingly do it to ourselves . <P> There is some deeply mystical power in the names we give things and in the process of naming . God 's first act after saying , " Let there be light " was to " call the light Day , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts after creating Adam was to bring every beast of the field so that Adam could give them names , " and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof . " <P> One of the most pleasant avocations of pregnancy  --  and one of the earliest assertions of parental power  --  is deciding on the baby 's name . The discussions sometimes go on until after the baby is born , when it becomes clear , for example , that the little girl should not be called Howard . Occasionally , of course , the father 's ( or mother 's ) yearning for a son is so intense that the girl is called Howard anyway . Some nations feel obliged to intervene against such eccentricities . In France , it is illegal to give any child a name that is not already held by a saint ( or a " well-known figure in ancient history " ) , who presumably would watch over the protege . The courts specifically forbade one couple to name their child Cerise ( Cherry ) . In the U.S. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen brothers who all bore names like Measles Jones and Pneumonia Jones and whatever other ills had afflicted the family at the time of their births . <P> We can only guess at the psychological effects of names ( What happens when that girl Howard reaches an age to be interested in other Howards ? ) , but it seems reasonable to suggest that a boy named John will grow up differently from one named Cuthbert . He is less likely to be beaten up by his schoolmates , for one thing . Fashions change , though , as Gertrude gives way to Marilyn , and Marilyn to Debbie ; a name that would have seemed weird a generation ago , like Kimberly , becomes a cliche . <P> Some names have a special kind of imprint . The famous Miss Hogg , whose father cruelly named her Ima , had good reason to grow up scowling , but maybe she would have even if she had been named something sweet , like Charlotte . Anyone named James Oliver Buswell IV carries his parents ' announcement of a certain view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of such a view probably differs considerably from one person to another . Someone with a name like Otto inevitably knows the burdens of an ethnic heritage , but so , presumably , do Madonna Ciccone and Fernando Valenzuela , and we all survive .
