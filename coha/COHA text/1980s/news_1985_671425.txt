The plan proposes to restrict sharply the number of cash awards to permit larger awards to the most severely affected claimants. // It also provides for two $30 million endowments for social services to veterans and to any of their children suffering from birth defects. // A distinctive feature of the 623-page plan , prepared by an appointee of Chief Judge Jack B. Weinstein , is that claimants would not have to prove that Agent Orange actually caused their injuries , only that they had ailments and that they were exposed to the herbicide in or around Vietnam during the sprayings from 1961 to 1972. // But under the plan only 5 percent of current claimants would receive any cash awards . These would not exceed $25 , 000 in the most severe cases of total disability and would be paid out over 10 years . Payments for a death would range up to $5 , 000 and also be payable over 10 years .

Many of the claims , however , may be judged invalid. // The plan , drawn up with the aid of veterans and consultants , is still subject to re jection or revision by Judge Weinstein after a public hearing in court next Tuesday . Lawyers representing veterans said they would take issue with some of the plan ' s provisions. // Kenneth R. Feinberg , a Washington lawyer who prepared the plan for Judge Weinberg , said he anticipated controversy . But he said , " My one consistent view is the need to prioritize and help the living. " // " The claims submitted reflect an enormous amount of suffering and despair , " he said in his report to the judge . " It is impossible to determine to what extent , if any , Agent Orange caused or contributed to this suffering . But both the physical and psychological problems of the members of the class are staggering.

The largest , $130 million , would go for cash payments to the most severely affected group of totally disabled veterans and the families of deceased veterans . The program would end on Dec. 31 , 1994. // // - An additional $60 million would be divided into two $30 million endowments administered by a nonprofit foundation . One would create a 25-year fund to provide services to families of children suffering from birth defects . A second would create a 10-year fund to provide outreach and counseling services and grants to assist veterans and their families. // // - The remaining $10 million would be set aside for administrative costs. // // - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional tort approach to compensation , " claimants would not be required to establish that exposure to Agent Orange caused their ailments , because of the difficulties of scientific proof and the administrative costs involved . Instead , claimants would be required to provide only medical proof of their disabilities and Vietnam service information that would be compared with Defense Department records of herbicide spraying. // // - Only those totally disabled according to Federal or private insurance standards and the families of deceased veterans would be eligible for cash awards . But in this group , awards would be given only in cases where the victims ranked among the 50 percent with the highest exposure to Agent Orange , according to military records . And the awards , payable over 10 years , would be not exceed $25 , 000 for the most severe disability and $5 , 000 for a death , provided they was not self-inflicted or the result of battles or accidents. // // - The two $30 million endowment funds would be for those veterans and their families who did not qualify for cash awards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be used for a hot line , counseling programs and research so long as they did not duplicate existing programs. // // - Claimants rejected for compensation or other services would have a right of appeal . The funds would be administered by a board of directors made up primarily of Vietnam veterans . <> <> The Suggestions of Veterans // Mr. Feinberg , the lawyer who prepared the plan , told Judge Weinstein that he hoped the payment program and service funds would be operational within a year. // Mr. Feinberg - a partner at Kaye , Scholer , Fierman , Hays &; Handler - said he had been guided by the suggestions of veterans that they preferred larger awards for disability than for death in order to avoid the implication that a veteran would be worth more dead than alive. // Mr. Feinberg , who played a major role in fashioning the settlement last May 7 , acknowledged that the number of claimants was far greater than expected at the time of the settlement. // But he said no fund would ever be considered adequate . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would not provide for all the victims and their families , " he said. // He voiced regret that the Government , which had commissioned , bought and sprayed the dioxin-contaminated herbicide , had consistently declined to take part in any settlement . <> <> U.S. Position Criticized // Earlier this month Judge Weinstein dismissed the remaining claims by Vietnam veterans against the Government . But he criticized the Government ' s position , which he called " vindictive " and " harsh and unyielding . " He ruled that the children were free to try to sue again in the future. // Mr. Feinberg ' s plan drew quick opposition from two of the leading lawyers in the veterans ' lawsuit who had been devising their own guidelines for distribution of the $200 million fund. // One of the lawyers , Gene Locks , of Philadelphia , said he favored a plan that would relate cash awards to certain diseases linked to dioxin , such as soft-tissue sarcomas , a type of cancer. // He also expressed doubts about allocating a large part of the money to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not have all the figures available to Mr. Feinberg. // " We will scrutinize it extremely carefully , " he said of the plan. // Thomas Henderson , another leading lawyer for the veterans , who worked with Mr. Locks on the distribution issue , said he too had serious doubts about the plan as proposed. // Mr. Feinberg said he was prepared for revisions in the plan , especially as better figures became available through questionnaires to be sent to the claimants . He said that he had discussed his proposals with Judge Weinstein but that the court might impose other changes . " Anyone who tries to predict what Judge Weinstein will do is making a mistake , " he said. // The seven companies that agreed to the settlement in exchange for the dropping of a lawsuit against them were the Dow Chemical Company , the Monsanto Company , the Diamond Shamrock Corporation , Uniroyal Inc. , the T.
