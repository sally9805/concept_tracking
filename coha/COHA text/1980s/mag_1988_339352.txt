Beep . " Mom , Dad , " says a 19-year-old , " I 'm sorry , but I 'm gay . And I will never , never change . " Beep . " I just want to say I 'm sorry , " sobs a young woman , who says she caused an automobile accident that killed five people . " I wish I could bring them back . " Beep . " I wish I had someone to share this with , " murmurs a man , revealing the secret pleasure he gets from wearing his wife 's clothing . <P> The soul baring goes on and on , recorded in 60-second messages to the Apology Sound-Off Line , a Los Angeles-based telephone service that offers the catharsis of confession for the price of a phone call . The service , started up this summer by a Los Angeles outfit called United Communications , receives some 200 anonymous calls a day from people admitting everything from marital infidelity to murder . " They are gut-wrenchingly honest , " says apology-line operator M.J. Denton . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay $2 for the first minute and 45 cents a minute after that to listen to confessions . The second number receives up to 10,000 calls a day . <P> Adultery is one of the most common transgressions . Callers admit their guilt over affairs with friends and next-door neighbors by voicing apologies intended for spouses . Others atone for past failings . Declared a recovered alcoholic : " I would like to apologize to all the people I hurt in my 18 years as an addict . " <P> Admissions of taboo , often criminal behavior pose a more serious dilemma .

" I buried my wife and daughter in the backyard . My other daughter is buried under the pier . " The Los Angeles police , who do not monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators to report likely crimes . But Denton does not feel qualified to judge whether someone is telling the truth . Besides , confessors ' calls are usually untraceable . <P> Are these true confessions ? Although police are skeptical , experts say many of the calls are probably legitimate . " Desperate people can be uncensored and unguarded at their moment of crisis , " says psychologist Gerald Goodman of the University of California , Los Angeles . Though the confessions contain an element of playacting , most callers want support for admission of sins . And listening to the confessions of others makes people feel better . " It normalizes your sense of guilt over transgressions to realize hundreds of others are doing it too , " explains Philip Zimbardo , a professor of psychology at Stanford University . <P> Why the phenomenal response ? " It 's the extreme privatization of entertainment , " says psychologist Jerald Jellison of the University of Southern California . Experts believe the anonymity of the telephone offers a psychological safety valve to the secret keeper , who feels compelled to unburden himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the interpersonal parallel of a one-night stand . " <P> Perhaps . Not everyone , however , feels guilty . One man called in to confess he had embezzled $10 million in a computer scam  --  and happily announced that % he was well and living in the Bahamas .
