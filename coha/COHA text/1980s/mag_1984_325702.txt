Tempting targets in L.A. <P> <P> More movies are made around Los Angeles , of course , than anywhere else in the U.S. More Mercedes-Benzes are sold there than in any other American city , more guacamole is served , more tans are perfectly maintained . Also , more banks are robbed there , many more . Last fiscal year in Los Angeles and its environs there were 1,720 bank heists , compared with 546 in San Francisco , the country 's second-place stick-'em-up city , 443 in New York City , 132 in Baltimore and just 56 in Chicago . Indeed , nearly one out of three U.S. <P> bank robberies takes place in the seven-county purview of the FBI 'S Los Angeles office . The last day without a bank holdup was Oct. 4,1979 . Says Lieutenant Joe Patterson of the Los Angeles County sheriffs robbery squad : ' The word is out on the street , in jail , among junkies : ' Hey , man , if you 're hurting , go to the bank . ' " Even as bank robberies are generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of 1983 ) , they are growing more rampant in Los Angeles ( up 18% last year ) . The Friday before Christmas set a new daily record : 21 banks robbed . <P> One reason is that Southern California just has a great many banks to rob , about 3,000 outlets by the FBI 'S reckoning . In addition , as the song says , L.A. is a great big freeway : the vast road system makes getaways easier . Still , the FBI says three-fourths of Los Angeles ' bank robberies are solved . Bad odds for the crooks , but rational analysis is not the strong suit of drug addicts , who the FBI believes are responsible for some 70% of the crimes . <P> The banks have been reluctant to take defensive measures . Says Robert Brosio , the U.S. Attorney 's chief prosecutor : <P> " The banks are so open and available , it 's an invitation to robbery . They have been seriously negligent in construction and design . " For instance , bullet-resistant " bandit barriers , " common in other large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You need a warm , inviting place to do business , " explains Stephen Ward , security director for the Crocker Bank . Nor are more secure designs necessarily worth the cost : for all the heists , the banks lose only $4 million a year to robbers , or an untroubling average of around $1,300 per branch . The public , of course , picks up the cost of apprehending , prosecuting and jailing the robbers . <P> Some of the robbers are rather intriguing . Last year 's " Yankee Bandit , " so called for the New York Yankees baseball cap he wore during his robberies , invariably broke into a broad smile as he left with his loot . He robbed 55 banks in six months for a total take of $190,000 . <P> Not long after an astonishing six heists on one November day , he apparently retired-or changed hats .
