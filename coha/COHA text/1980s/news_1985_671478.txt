" // There have not yet been any reports of Akitas , Apricas or Adidases being flung out of West Side windows . ( For the uninitiated , those are dogs , strollers and shoes of choice for yuppies . ) But , nonetheless , many of New York ' s young professionals are suffering from " yuppie guilt " and engaging in " yuppie denial " - a syndrome that many analysts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of yuppie civilization as we know it. // " By the end of the summer , " predicted Lee Atwater , a Republican political consultant who charts baby boom trends , " the yuppie movement will be dead. " // Michael Kinsley , writing in Gentleman ' s Quarterly , reveals that shame has led the once unabashed yuppies to hole up " behind the bolted doors of their condominiums , bentwood rockers jammed up under the doorknobs.

" // " I start saying things like ' Oh , I go to foreign films , too . I ' ve seen ' Jules and Jim , ' " she said. // Although they may crave individuality and loathe their label , many of this generation of grand acquisitors say they remain comfortable with the basic tenets of the life style . " On the whole , in spite of the pejorative aspect , yuppies still take a masochistic glee in being yuppies , " says Jonathan Silver , 27 , a financial analyst .
