But like a Verdi heroine dying with a knife in her breast , Rome continues to sing impressively . <P> No modern Italian knows this role better than Alberto Moravia , who has been Italy 's leading literary celebrity for half a century . His first novel , The Time of Indifference ( 1929 ) , scrutinized the bourgeoisie and the coming of Mussolini .
