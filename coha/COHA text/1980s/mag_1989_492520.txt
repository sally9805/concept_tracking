A MAN WITH A MISSION when the captain of America 's cancer-prevention war starts eating more fiber , cuts out fatty foods , and climbs all ten flights of stairs to his office  --  every day  --  a wise person sits up and takes notice . Here 's the man privy to all the latest cancer research , the man on the cutting edge of modern medicine . He knows what 's good for us and what 's bad ; at this very moment , he 's overseeing studies on vitamin A , vitamin E , selenium , and molybdenum , to name just a few . Yet what impresses one most about Dr. Peter Greenwald , director of the National Cancer Institute 's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control , is his down-to-earth , no-nonsense common sense . Eat right , exercise , pay attention to your body . Team this basic advice , he says , with new research findings on cancer chemoprevention , and we might just beat this deadly disease . ? ? ? With his warm smile and in his office crowded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is 53 , looks far more like a favorite family doctor than a white-coat researcher closeted away among high-tech laboratories . He seems a modest man , a family man , a man who proudly tells how he and his children Rebecca , 20 ; Laura , 18 ; and Daniel , 16 ? helped deliver their dog 's pups . His proud boast is about his wife : Harriet , he says , is a fantastic cook " who manages to make fiber dishes both tasty and low-fat . " This is no small compliment coming from a man whose entire life revolves around food . Since assuming his post in 1981 , Greenwald has never let what we eat stray too far from his mind . In fact , in those eight years , the National Cancer Institute has built a major new area of research , emphasizing the link between diet and cancer . And for good reason : Greenwald says studies now point to dietary causes in eight or nine of the ten most common cancers  --  with particularly strong links to cancers of the colon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone knows by this point , I believe , that cigarette smoking is the leading cause of cancer deaths , " Greenwald says . " They 're clearly preventable  --  and that 's known with absolute certainty . About 30 percent of cancer deaths are due to cigarette smoking , but happily , in the United States , the tide of public opinion is changing . People are giving up smoking . Some of them do n't even want to be associated with smokers and breathe in the carcinogens from the smoke of others . " But what many Americans may not yet realize , Greenwald says , is that our standard high-fat , low-fiber diet may be even more deadly than cigarette smoking . " We do n't know as much about it at this point , " he cautions . Under Greenwald 's direction , we are , however , about to find out . For the first time , the NCI has embarked on human clinical trials designed to test the theory of chemoprevention . The term chemotherapy is now routinely associated with treating already established cancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  both natural nutrients and laboratory-made synthetics  --  that may prevent cancer from ever taking hold . More than 30 such studies are currently under way . Among them : ? At Harvard , 22,000 doctors are participating in a study of beta carotene , the substance that gives carrots their orange color . Half the doctors are receiving beta carotene pills ; the other half are taking placebos . The study will trace the development of cancer in both groups . ? In Seattle , several thousand former asbestos workers who also are heavy smokers are being given beta carotene and vitamin A. These workers have a " very , very high risk of lung cancer , " Greenwald says , but at present there is nothing medical science can do for them until the cancer develops . The study hopes to show that chemoprevention may stop the cancer from ever occurring . ? In China , 30,000 farmers with a precancerous condition usually leading to cancer of the esophagus are being treated with four combinations of vitamins and minerals . The pre-cancerous dysplasia is already present , but will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milan , Italy , researchers are studying 5,000 women who have been treated successfully for cancer in one breast . " The problem is that they have a very high risk of getting cancer in the other breast , " Greenwald says . To try to prevent a recurrence , the women are taking a synthetic compound related to vitamin A. " Not something you can buy in a health-food store or anywhere else , " he adds . Already , one of these human clinical studies , published just this September , has proven that cereal fiber can shrink precancerous polyps in the colon . The " cure " in this case : something as simple as two bowls of All-Bran each day . Fifty-eight people , known to be at high risk for developing colon cancer because of an inherited family condition , were included in the four-year study , headed by Dr. Jerome DeCosse at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan . All were instructed to eat two servings of cereal each day . Half were given Kellogg 's All-Bran , or 22.5 grams of fiber daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but containing very low amounts of fiber . The number and size of the precancerous polyps shrank in the All-Bran group ; the low-fiber test group experienced no such benefits . Because almost all colon cancer  --  the nation 's most deadly form of cancer  --  begins with the formation of these polyps , Greenwald says the findings are extremely important . He says that although the size of the test group was small , " it gives us the first direct evidence about the benefits of fiber . " Another recently completed clinical trial gives further evidence that chemoprevention may hold great promise for the future . In an NCI study , persons with large numbers of skin tumors were fed a vitamin A-related compound , called 13-cis retinoic acid . While receiving the synthetic nutrient , patients had dramatic reductions in the number of new skin tumors . " We do n't feel the evidence is clear enough yet to recommend that people take I3-cis retinoic acid , " Greenwald says . " But we do feel there is enough evidence that it 's very important to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can Americans do to increase their odds of preventing cancer ? Greenwald recommends the changes his own family has made : cutting down on fat , keeping trim with regular exercise , and eating more fiber  --  from 20 to 30 grams each day . Although a high-fiber breakfast cereal is a convenient way to meet a portion of that requirement , Greenwald says Americans also should increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables . " We do n't recommend cereal for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , " he quips . Greenwald pauses to remember his own diet during the past 24 hours : whole-grain cereal with peach slices and skim milk for breakfast , a tuna sandwich for lunch , Chinese stir-fry for dinner . " We 're not fanatic about our diets , " he says , " but we are careful . " Private industry can help in the fight against cancer , Greenwald says , by offering healthful packaged foods and promoting more high-fiber , low-fat products . Croissants and high-fat ice creams are disappointing new products , he notes , but other companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food companies are looking for ways to make foods more healthful , " Greenwald says , encouraged by recent trends . " They need time to do it ; obviously they have to market their things . But I think , by and large , they are responsible and do a good job . " As an example , Greenwald cites Kellogg 's , " who actually called up and said , ' We 'd like to hear what it is you 're saying and make sure we 're accurate on continued on page 110 syllable . He looked at his dad . " They 're all right now , Patrick , and I guess you do n't need me any more . " He quickly added , " Not that you needed me in the first place . You being nine years old now . " He turned to the stairs . Sir Golden and his wife began flashing round and round so gaily that Patrick had to dip out some water lest they leap over the rim . This done , he looked down at them and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . But this was a drop of joy . ? ? ? He took up the bowl , carefully climbed the stairs and  --  the singing loud about him  --  entered and went down between the long tables set for supper . One by one , the voices left off singing . Miss Elder had to stop playing the piano because she saw his little miracle . Thinking she ought to be very prim , like the schoolmarms she used to read about , she said most primly , " Ah , I see ! Very good , Patrick . " That was about all that kind of nonsense she could manage . She jumped up the way she was supposed to jump and shouted , " Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " " Hurray ! Hurray ! " cried Greta . " Hurray for Patrick ! " Everybody else said much the same thing , and Bartley Green , who had let the fire go out in the first place , said it louder than anybody else . He came up to Patrick and gave him his own best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And now , ladies and gentlemen , " said Miss Elder , " the winner of the Christmas Poetry Prize of the Piety Corner School will honor us with a reading of his composition . " She handed the wonderful paper to Patrick . He read it gravely all the way through the last lines : " What will Sir do when winter slides over the Catskills , Miss Elder ? When Jack Frost steals with his icicles into the spring-hole ? " He looked up from the paper quivering in his hand . Was it finished  --  the poem ? Not quite . That same always-working somebody within him , in a big hurry , added three more lines that were n't scrawled on the paper at all : Leave it to Patrick who 's just turned nine , And now at Merry Christmas Time Patrick sings his Christmas rhyme for our dears . Man with a Mission continued from page 61 it . ' " Kellogg 's , he says , looked at the data ; put the National Cancer Institute 's messages on its cereal boxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even included a toll-free telephone number for additional information . This kind of teamwork is the key to achieving Greenwald 's immediate goal for cancer prevention . One of his initial projects at the NCI was to develop a complex computer model , plotting information on the American population , cancer risks , and current screening tests . What would happen , he wondered , if Americans all stopped smoking ? What if they all got screening tests and state-of-the-art diagnosis and therapy ? " Putting it all together , it 's quite clear that it 's possible to cut cancer death rates in half by the year 2000 , " Greenwald says . " It 's possible , but it only will happen if everyone gets behind it in a very major way . " A major way , he says , calls for a smoke-free society , more healthful diets , mammograms , colon cancer tests , and Pap tests used universally . And , Greenwald adds , " I think prudence is on the side of having our environment be clean and safe . " Again , that @ @ @ @ @
