The street near a Tehran railway station was a shambles : blackened cars , shattered glass , women in black chadors weeping as volunteers carried away the wounded . A bomb had exploded during the morning rush hour , killing 18 people and wounding some 300 others . It was the most serious terrorist bombing in Tehran since 1982 , when more than 60 people were killed in an explosion at the central telephone and telecommunications center .
