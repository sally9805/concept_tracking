THE TAM OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ACORDING to W. H. Auden , poetry could he defined quite simply as " memorable speech , " and in his writings he left behind him much that was memorable . Besides that , he was , as a presence , unforgettable . In this city , he keeps intruding into the talk of those who knew him , and they unwrap their carefully kepi glimpses of him like talismans . Some of these separate rememberings came together over a week not long ago in a series of events arranged by the New York Institute for the Humanities , at the instigation of the poet Joseph Brodsky , to mark the tenth anniversary of Auden 's death , in Vienna . A friend of ours visited his grave in Kirchstatten , Austria , last summer , and she reported to us that the villagers are still enormously proud of the presence that came to rest among them , and still feel great affection for his shade , as we do . We remember him coming to these offices , rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some of those gnomic pronouncements that the poet 's friends saved like first editions . Perhaps the most affecting commemoration took place at the Guggenheim Museum , where a group of distinguished poets read their own choices of Auden 's work . Auden is not one of those writers who have imprinted themselves on us with a few works , or only one . He was always shifting and experimenting , and he left behind a string of good books , prose as well as poetry , like discarded selves . The poets made clear to us not only how many Audens there are but how many of his poems are as familiar as furniture , as places once lived in . Later in the week , others recalled Auden , but in less than memorable speech  --  the kind of discourse he impatiently dismissed as " humbug , " for while intelligent appreciation pleased him any other kind embarrassed him . It was Auden 's old friend Christopher Isherwood who spoke of him with the pure light of insight : " We met in school , when Auden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set then , in a kind of schoolboy irreverence we shared all our life . As we met in later life , we were still conspirators , two gifted schoolboys playing grownups and getting away with it . When Auden began to be referred to as a ' great poet , ' we giggled together at the idea . " This gave us a clue to something essential in Auden . The imagery of school stayed with him lifelong . He felt himself at first the bright , irreverent schoolboy , and then , as he aged , the brusque but kindly headmaster , with ever-wagging finger . He liked to acquire pocketfuls of miscellaneous information , and he presided over dinner conversations with the vigilant eye of a housemaster . He was much too impatient , much too iconoclastic to enter the academy , except in occasional forays , but he taught instinctively all his life and , like every good teacher , learned thirstily . He sometimes made absentminded professors look like faded imitations of him , for his mind was always working , often to the exclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Auden 's view , our lives were a long struggle with the rules . In a time that , as he pointed out , was not indulgent to poetry , he took the office of poet most seriously , for he saw the poet both as guardian of the clarity of the language and as refresher of it . We had a number of conversations with him about words , always illuminating , for at the tip of his memory he had a wealth of example . He also had another , quite separate importance . T. S. Eliot , who , as poet and critic , dominated the generation before Auden , and who published him from the beginning , had settled in London and taken British nationality  --  a cultural transplant . Auden , by far the most brilliant poet of his generation in England , restored a sort of balance by choosing to move to New York and become an American citizen . As Christopher Isherwood reminded us , he remained the most English of beings , but he lived in New York decisively , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cultural interpreter , much prized by both his friends here and his readers . He was a thoroughly domestic creature : his active world was truly the top of his long , rickety work table , his forum the dining-room table . We stood , soon after the event at the Guggenheim , in a knot of people looking up at the second-floor windows of 77 St. Mark 's Place , behind which he used to write . Below the windows , a newly installed brass plaque on the wall read : WYSTAN HUGH AUDEN Feb. 21 , 1907 ? Sept. 28 , 1973 Here lived , from 1953 to 1972 , W. H. Auden , English poet and American citizen . " If equal affection can not be , Let the more loving one be me . " Auden is buried in Kirclist  --  tten , and a memorial stone is in place in Poets ' Corner , in Westminster Abbey . We felt immensely glad to see the brass plate , for Auden 's civilizing presence has meant a lot to this city , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent events his survival . So many lines of his reverberate issue of November 13 , 1954 : What but tall tales , the luck of verbal playing , Can trick his lying nature into saying That love , or truth in any serious sense , Like orthodoxy , is a reticence . Brother GAUZY black curtains were draped over the windows of the Peacock Lounge , at 148th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard , one afternoon a while back , and the sidewalk fairly teemed with jeans-clad young persons toting walkie-talkies . We stopped to listen as a passerby , a woman who seemed to have a proprietary feeling about the block , sought an explanation . " What are you-all doing , may I ask ? " the woman said . " We 're shooting a movie , " a hefty young black man replied . " It 's called The Brother Who Fell to Earth . ' It 's about an alien who comes to Harlem and visits this bar . " " ' The Man Who Fell from Earth ' ? " " No , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fell to Earth ' ? " " No , not ' The Man ' ? The Brother . ' " The news took a moment to register . " This is a nice bar , " she said . " I hope you get a Grammy . " She moved on . The young man , who stayed put , told us that his name was Gil Williams and that he had quit his job as an advertising traffic manager for Lord &; Taylor in order to work as a " P.A. , " or production assistant , on " The Brother . " His duties , he said , included quite a bit of the sort of community-relations activity in which we had just observed him . " All day long , they 're coming at you with questions , " he said . " You 've got to make talk with them . " Another P.A. , a blond-haired young man named Larry Justice , said he , too , had just made a career move  --  and also a physical one , from Dallas to New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life over , " he said . " This is something I 've been wanting to do for a long time , but maybe I did n't have the courage . " In his three months as a New Yorker , Mr. Justice said , he had worked on three films , passing by word of mouth from one to the next . We remarked that that sounded to us like quick progress . " Most people tell me it is , " he said . On the other hand , he went on , the first job had paid only a hundred dollars for three weeks ' work , while this one offered only a deferred salary , which is to come from the hypothetical profits . Mr. Justice said that before leaving Dallas he had saved up money with just such a contingency in mind . " I knew I would have to work for free , " he said . " I 'm interested in directing or producing , but I do n't know any other way to get started in the business . You can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his degree is in finance ? " but you 're still going to have to go and work as a production assistant for free . " Stepping through the door beneath an unlit sign reading " BAR  --  PEACOCK , " we were immediately engulfed in more representatives of the species Young Aspiring Filmmaker , and their accessories . A scene was under way , set in the interior of a friendly Harlem saloon decorated with purple and yellow tinsel and with posters of everyone from Martin Luther King , Jr. , to Bruce Lee . Among the cast of characters we focussed on a silent fellow with exotically curled hair and with a vaguely otherworldly look to the rest of him , who had purposefully placed his hand on the back of a machine we recognized as a video game . Suddenly , one of the other actor-patrons let out a cry of astonishment : " He fixed it ! The brother fixed it ! " Was this , then , the Brother of the title ? We guessed it was , for we recalled several aliens in our cinematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix . At barside , meanwhile , one of the patrons  --  script in hand , because he was off camera  --  asked where this miracle worker hailed from . The Brother 's only reply was to lift his thumb in the general direction of the Above and Beyond . " Up , " someone suggested . " Uptown . " " Man 's from the South Bronx , " said a second voice . Between takes , we approached a lanky , low-keyed young man  --  not so young as the majority of the crew , but young nonetheless  --  wearing a Coors Light cap and a day 's growth of beard . We recognized him as John Sayles , the writer-director of " Return of the Secaucus 7 , " " Liana , " and " Baby , It 's You , " and the screenwriter of such fast and furious productions as " Piranha , " " Alligator , " and " The Howling . " " It 's very hard to shoot in New York City for two hundred thousand dollars , " Mr. Sayles said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because you have to get locations for free and you do n't have a thousand police officers to block off the street . You just have to ask people as politely as you can to stay hack , and sometimes it does n't work . People have to get where they 're going , and sometimes they want to look in the camera on the way . " Two hundred thousand dollars , he explained , is what it will take , more or less , to get " The Brother Who Fell to Earth " " in the can . " That sum is coming out of his own pocket , recently swelled by one of those MacArthur Foundation awards that have become known as " genius awards . " With post-production expenses and deferred payments , the cost might climb to about three hundred thousand dollars , Mr. Sayles told us , and the extra funds remained to be found . When Mr. Sayles returned to his duties , we noted that the actor playing the Brother was at liberty , so we trailed him out onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for substandard pay . Joe Morton  --  that was his name  --  said he was getting union scale but in order to act in the movie had made some sacrifice of income from his far more lucrative work on the daytime soap opera " Another World . " On that show , Mr. Morton said , he received not only a normal TV-sized salary for the part of the ophthalmologist Dr. Abel Marsh but a bonus for playing Dr. Marsh 's freewheeling twin brother , the rock-and-roll singer Leo Mars  --  a character Mr. Morton himself had created after deciding that the doctor 's role did n't give him enough range . " What attracted me to this picture was that even though it 's about an alien it 's extremely human , " Mr. Morton said . " It 's very much like what would happen if I had been born in Africa and was seeing Harlem for the first time . " At first , the Brother is an observer , he explained . " Where he comes from , they do n't speak . The communication is through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Morton was spotted . " This is the man on ' Another World ' ! " an ample woman wearing an " E.T . " sweatshirt called to her companion , who was sucking on the remains of a lime lollipop . Turning to Mr. Morton , she said , " I want to know which one you like . " " You mean Quinn or Henrietta ? " 11,1r . Morton replied , impressively quick to interpret a question that had struck us as elusive . " That 's right , " said the woman . " I 'm not going to tell you , " he answered . " And you 've got a brother that 's a doctor , right ? " she asked . Mr. Morton admitted that this was so , adding , delicately , " Did you know I play both parts ? " " Well , we figured that , since you 're doubles , " the woman said . A moment later , Mr. Morton was up on the fender of a white Dodge Dart and in the affectionate embrace of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hey , Mildred , I finally met me a movie star ! " said the woman in the " E.T . " sweatshirt , sitting to Mr. Morton 's right and leaving no discernible distance between them . " Oh , boy ! Come on , Mildred . " The camera clicked . " Your hand is on the flash , Mildred . " " Will you get down ? " said the photographer . " It 's my turn . " Ignoring the entreaty , the first woman asked Mr. Morton if he was married , and he answered in the affirmative . ( Mr. Morton , we subsequently learned , made this statement in " selfdefense ; " actually , he is divorced . ) " Hey , Mildred , he 's married , " she said . " Let 's go . " ? AFORTNIGHT later , we met up with Mr. Sayles ' company again , now working with a new title , " The Brother from Another Planet , " and at a new location , the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside , Mr. Sayles was quiet-y supervising a scene in which the Brother and a small boy passed through a photographic exhibit depicting Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad . The Brother , still speechless , was pointing to a picture of an escaped slave and then to himself , to let the boy and the audience understand his origins as a slave from outer space . After three takes , Mr. Sayles leaned against a handy pillar , and we asked him how things were going . In reply , he spoke enthusiastically about an all-night stint of shooting on Ellis Island , where , in the movie , the Brother 's spacecraft crashes to Earth . " I had been out there about two years ago for the tour , and had got really strong vibes from the place , having had relatives who had come through there , " Mr. Sayles said . " And the minute I started writing this film I said , ' He 'll have to crash there . ' Being out there was very nice . Half of the place is falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . It had this very eerie quiet . " True , Mr. Sayles said , getting the cast and crew onto Ellis Island had been costly , but " not nearly as difficult as shooting in the subway . " He laughed , and observed that many filmmakers , faced with a scene set in the subway system , probably figure they can just go down there and shoot . That , Mr. Sayles had learned , is definitely not the case ; what with insurance and the difficulty of getting a permit from the Transit Authority , he had hardly even considered shooting there . Instead , " The Brother , " like countless movies before it , had used the subway museum in downtown Brooklyn . That had entailed a **30;6976;TOOLONG deposit for four hours  --  big money in Mr. Sayles ' budget . Luckily , much of " The Brother " takes place on the streets , and there , Mr. Sayles said , he had had a minimum of hassles . " In fact , at one site , where we had a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum , two sort of wino-type guys came by and said , ' That 's not how we do it , ' " he told us . The mistake , Mr. Sayles learned , lay in using wood instead of newspaper . " During another scene , " he went on , " five or six people showed up saying that they were the superin tendent of the building and wanted to he paid . " Perhaps , he speculated , the recent presence in Harlem of several bigger-spending film companies had heightened expectations . But now that " The Brother " was in its fourth , and last , week of shooting , he said , more and more residents seemed to know that his movie was somehow different . " The other day , a couple of guys came up to me and said , ' Are you hiring ? ' And I said , ' No . Sorry . ' And they said , ' Oh , we heard about you . You 're the low-budget film . ' " The crew finished setting up for the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his place as director and , after a few soft words to the actors , spoke , just as softly , the magic word " Action . " Voices from Nowhere OUT there on the frontier , smack up against the great or ghastly unknown , it can get , oh , so very quiet . Sometimes the only sound is your heartbeat . ( Sometimes there are chain saws . ) But stay out there long enough and it 's a sure bet you 'll begin to hear voices . Voices that belong to no man . Voices from nowhere . These last weeks , we 've a little time with the pio-on America 's newest frontier ? the uncharted wilder-ness of high tech . And we 've heard some voices . To operate DECtalk , a new way for com-puters to talk with an unlimited vocabulary , you type the words you wish to hear on a key-hoard ? " Fourscore and seven years ago , " per-haps  --  and then hit the return key . Instant-ly , in the unmistakable tones of an inebriated Swede speaking En-glish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DECtalk product manager at Dig-ital Equipment Corpo-ration , was standing on the sidelines at the press conference where DECtalk announced its entry into the market . How , we asked him , did the four-thousandTHE NEW YORKER 23 dollar box of logic cir- cuits chips , bits , bytes  --  learn to talk ? " It was like magic , " he said , and for a second we understood . But then Twaits launched into a long and devious spiel about " computer models of the human vocal track " and the calculation of sixteen variables , including the size of sinus cavities , and by the time he was done we were reduced to asking , " Can it sing ? " Yes , this one can , provided you request " Strangers in the Night . " A roomful of adult reporters listened respectfully as DECtalk showed off at its press conference . It spoke in five of its eight voices ( an extended family of soused Scandinavians , from a grade-schooler named Kit the Kid right up through Frail Frank , a senior citizen ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty words per minute , and introduced a lot of Digital Equipment executives , none of whom performed tongue twisters or anything else . Instead , they talked about bisynchronous terminal support , and the automated office of the future , and the awesome number of potential applications for DECtalk , which is being used at the Children 's Hospital in Boston to speak for young children who are nonspeaking or have very severe speech difficulties . When the press conference ended , we sidled up to a keyboard and put the machine through its paces . " War is peace , " it burbled dutifully . For a moment , we could n't think of anything else we wanted it to say , but only for a moment . We carefully selected Voice Four , Uppity Ursula , typed in our message , and then leaned hack to hear her say , " I find you fascinating and handsome  --  indeed , the fairest of them all . " ? EJSS fluent than DECtalk , perhaps , but no less sincere was a birthday card that arrived in our mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he in the stores any day now . You plunk down ten bucks for this card and mail it ( $1.39 ) to your friend on his birthday ; he notes with interest the television-set motif on the front of the card , and then opens it to be greeted by a voice ( Sun Belt and sober ) that says , " We 've lost our video . Do not adjust your card . We 'll continue with our audio . Happy Birthday to You ! " To talk with the people behind the talking card , we called Kansas City , the home of Hallmark Cards . Product Manager Don French , in a cheerful voice with a trace of drawl , said that plans for the talking card were laid in midsummer after six musical cards rang up big sales . " High tech seems to be working with the greeting card right now , " Mr. French said . " We thought of light , and we thought of movement , and then we finally settled on voice . Once we 'd done that , we chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are me-to-you systems , the talking card , with its anonymous voice , is a third-person system . The TV announcer was a natural . Then we had our editors and writers develop the sentiment for the man to say . They also reviewed a lot of tapes to find the right voice . We were so pleased with this one guy  --  his name was Ray  --  that we flew him to New York from California to tape the card . We originally envisioned him concluding the message by singing ' Happy Birthday , ' but no one thought to ask him if he could sing . He could n't . We 're not stopping with talking cards , by the way . We 're working on some holography cards for spring release . They will be real 3-D holograms , produced with a laser . " Besides a bevy of engineers , designers , and writers , Hallmark works with Dr. R. Chris Martin , a motivation psychologist at the University of Missouri . Martin , who analyzes several Hallmark lines , said that the new high-tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are decorated with " an extremely organized grid pattern " ? represent " the top of the wave of the computer age . " " When people buy these new hightech-spawned products , they are saying , by their buying behavior , ' I belong . This is my generation , ' " he told us . " It is a very positive statement . " As far as we 're concerned , there is at least one additional advantage . The card lasts a long time ( two hundred replays of the message guaranteed ) and it never wises up that your birthday is over , so it can salute you again and again , if you 're that sort of person .
