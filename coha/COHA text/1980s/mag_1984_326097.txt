Bitches , saints or role models , TV 's glamour queens ride high <P> Alexis , daahr-ling . Of course we know that you and Dynasty are simply the last word in TV glamour . But have you noticed the crowd you have attracted lately ? That nasty Morgan Fairchild on Paper Dolls makes and breaks the careers of models half her age with the flick of a fingernail and looks smashing while doing it . The women of Dallas have taken a page from your book and hired their own designer to come up with dazzling new outfits to wear around Southfork . Even TV detectives , for heaven 's sake , are starting to look like fashion spreads in Vogue . Jennifer O'Neill trots off to swank locations around the world posing as a fashion photographer in Cover Up .

Yvette Mimieux will star in a midseason show on NBC called Berrenger 's , about a posh New York City department store similar to Bloomingdale 's . And Angie Dickinson and Candice Bergen head the cast of Hollywood Wives , an upcoming ABC mini-series based on Jackie Collins ' spicy bestseller . <P> TV 's obsession with glamour seems a throwback to the glittery fantasy worlds that Hollywood created in the 1930s , ' 40s and ' 50s , then largely abandoned for social relevance and downbeat realism in the ' 60s and ' 70s .
