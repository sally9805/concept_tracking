Lennon ' s killer pleads guilty <P> He received the word from God , he said , and even repeated arguments from his defense lawyers could not dissuade him .

When Assistant District Attorney Allen Sullivan asked the defendant why he had used especially destructive hollow-point bullets in the shooting , Chapman laconically replied , " To ensure Lennon 's death . " <P> After the hearing , Sullivan revealed that Chapman had a " hit list " of other celebrities he had considered killing if he could not get to Lennon . The list reportedly included Johnny Carson and Jacqueline Onassis . " He did not intend to kill all of them , " said Defense Attorney Jonathan Marks . " In the event he could not find A , he would kill B. He just intended to kill somebody . " <P> Though Chapman faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life , acting State Supreme Court Justice Dennis Edwards promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not receive more than 20 years to life . At Chapman 's sentencing on Aug. 24 , Marks plans to use the testimony of two psychiatrists and one psychologist-as well as his defendant 's God-given plea-to argue that Chapman is insane and thus should be given the most lenient sentence . <P> Meanwhile , the killer sits alone in his cell at Rikers Island , reading and watching TV . The only other inmate in the 13-cell maximum-security row is Craig Crimmins , 22 , convicted of murdering a violinist at the Metropolitan Opera House .
