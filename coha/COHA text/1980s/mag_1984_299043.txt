For radiation victims , justice a generation later <P> The nuclear bombs began exploding in the Nevada desert in 1951 , when Sheldon Nisson was five . " They used to tell us to get up and watch the blasts , " recalls his mother Helen , who still lives in Washington , Utah , some 125 miles downwind from the test site . " We saw the clouds go over all the time . Our children played outside . All the while , the Government kept saying that it would n't hurt us . " But when the last of 102 mushroom clouds rose above the desert in 1962 , Sheldon Nisson was dead from leukemia . His cancer , along with that of nine other victims , Federal District Court Judge Bruce Jenkins ruled last week , resulted from exposure to those drifting clouds of radioactive fallout . The judge found that area residents had not been given sufficient warning about the dangers of radiation and ordered the Government to pay $2.66 million to the afflicted families . <P> Jenkins ' elaborate 489-page decision , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics , medicine , probability theory and Greek philosophy with the legal issues at stake . " This case is concerned with atoms , with government , with people , with legal relationships and with social values , " he wrote . As evidence that atomic tests cause cancer , Jenkins cited several studies , including one of thousands of Utah residents who lived near the testing area : among those residents the incidence of cancer is 50% greater than normal . Some of the malignancy , Jenkins wrote , " is demonstrated to have been caused more likely than not by nation-state conducted open-air nuclear events . " <P> The Government , Jenkins ruled , did not deliberately expose civilians to radioactivity in the 1950s , as some have suggested , when test bombs were being detonated almost monthly . Nonetheless , officials were negligent . When winds were blowing eastward from the test site toward the sparsely populated stretches of Utah and northern Arizona , the Government seemed unconcerned . Radiation sensors were few and often operated improperly . And officials disregarded evidence of potential hazards . Said former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plaintiffs : " The tragic thing is that all this could have been prevented . " <P> The ten successful plaintiffs were among a vanguard group of 24 whose cases were heard by Jenkins as representative of the claims being made by relatives of 375 cancer victims . In the 14 other cases , the judge decided , atomic radiation was not clearly the cause of cancer . J. MacArthur Wright of St. George , Utah , an attorney who represented the victims , was pleased that Jenkins ' decision establishes clear standards for litigating-or settling out of court-the remaining cases . " What I see as important , " said Wright , " is that in all of the leukemia cases we tried , the court ruled for us . And in two of the tumor cases , he ruled for us . So in the case of leukemia , thyroid and breast cancers , the judge seems to be saying that there is enough evidence to show that radiation was responsible . "                @ @ @ @ @
