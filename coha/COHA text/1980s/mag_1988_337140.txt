The young James Joyce wrote The Dead in some disillusionment . It was the last story of Dubliners , a group of tales setting forth the cramped spirit of the middle-class Ireland from which he had exiled himself even before the book was published . <P> The aged John Huston filmed The Dead  --  the last of his 37 features  --  in great serenity , just before he died last summer . In it he set forth his affection for the writer he said he loved best and , paradoxically , for the Ireland to which he exiled himself for the midpassage of a life that was , in its way , as restless and troublesome as Joyce 's . <P> On the feast of the Epiphany , Jan. 6 , 1904 , some old friends gather , as they have for many years on this day , at the home of two elderly sisters for dancing and supper . They sing songs and make speeches . They quarrel about the opera and worry about the drunkenness of one man while not noticing that another is getting quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended , and Huston is wonderfully ambiguous about it : affectionate toward the hospitable impulses at work here , slyly satirical about the clumsy ways these impulses are expressed . <P> At the end of the party , a tenor sings an old air , The Lass of Aughrim . This puts Gretta Conroy ( Anjelica Huston ) in a pensive mood : a delicate young man she once loved , and who hastened his death by courting her , used to sing it . In their hotel room , Gretta tells her husband Gabriel ( Donal McCann ) about this lost love , arousing an unworthy jealousy . She falls asleep , and he stares out the window , as the snow  --  symbol of the universe 's indifference to petty social preoccupations and petty emotions too  --  falls " upon all the living and the dead . " Nature , playing no favorites , blankets them all together . <P> Huston has precisely duplicated onscreen both the simple two-part structure of Joyce 's story and much of its dialogue . The old Hollywood adventurer 's mood and motives do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , Huston 's handling of this material is so direct , artless and unassertive that one 's first enthusiasm for it is tempered by doubt . Perhaps our desire that his last movie represent the best of his several selves is coloring our reaction . Mistrust , however , must yield to Huston 's trust of his medium , his material and himself . <P> He was working in very tight spaces here , but they never make him claustrophobic . His camera is like a calm , courtly stranger at this revel , quietly accepting its physical restraints , determined to make the best of its intimacy with a marvelous ensemble of actors . They , in turn , are charmingly unpretentious as they reveal the humanity beneath their unpromising surfaces . <P> When the celebration of Epiphany gives way to the Joycean epiphany of Gabriel 's concluding thoughts , Huston yields the screen to his beloved master in a wonderfully self-effacing way . The powerful words are voiced over the simplest imaginable montage of Irish snowscapes . Huston 's great contribution is only this : he gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human frailty , thereby tempering a young man 's impatience with it . <P> It is quite enough . With this graceful Dead , Huston served his source generously and himself handsomely , contriving what few in film have managed : a sublimely moving exit .
