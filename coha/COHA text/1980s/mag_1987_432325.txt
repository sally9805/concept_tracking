 | In the relentless Postmodern Age , how can an old-fashioned modern museum keep up ? The Museum of Modern Art in New York does n't limit itself to venerating 20th-century masters , kneeling in worship as they recede into history . A new curator , Linda Shearer , now scans the crazily diverse contemporary art scene for promising work by younger artists . Still , no one is accusing MOMA of turning trendy . This week the museum opens a major exhibition tracing the career of Paul Klee ? an artist who has been out of fashion for many years and dead for half a century . This ambitious retrospective remains the kind of show that MOMA does best . It has been nearly 20 years since a major American museum took such a long and thoughtful look at Klee 's work , and his talent and diversity are sure to offer a new generation of viewers its own shock of recognition . While painting his whimsical fun house of birds , fish and sailing ships and developing his fantastic vocabulary of signs and symbols , Klee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abstraction . The exhibition is " a virtual index of the art of our century , " writes MOMA curator Carolyn Lanchner in the excellent catalog . The show will travel to the Cleveland Museum of Art in June and the Kunstmuseum Bern in Switzerland in September . Klee was not a man of modest ambition . In a famous lecture in 1924 , he called the artist " a philosopher " and said his mission was to create a new world different from the one he found around him . A Swiss German , Klee was a tidy man ; he so craved privacy in his studio that he stuffed up the keyhole . Born in 1879 , he kept a meticulous record of his work , including such childhood drawings as a picture of a clock ? one of his recurring symbols ? made when he was four years old . In 1905 Klee made an etching called " Hero With the Wing " ; it embodied the notion that man was trapped , one leg rooted into the earth , but having only a single wing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had allied himself with Wassily Kandinsky and the Blaue Reiter artists in Mu-@# @# nich . But it was n't until he took a trip to North Africa in 1914 that he felt in command of his vision . Inspired by the synchromist art of Robert Delaunay , he painted a series of cubist watercolor landscapes , brilliantly infused with counterpoint patches of color . He was a prodigious recorder of his ideas on art . " Color possesses me , " he wrote triumphantly in his diary . " Color and I are one . I am a painter . " The pictures were among the last he painted from nature . From the depths of his imagination he drew the raw materials for his new universe . A powerful sense of line was his best tool . His paintings based on cubism and abstraction often included finely rendered creatures or fanciful machines , arrows , clocks and staircases , moons and stars . But his witty , toylike figures do n't always mask the darker side of his vision ; consider for example the mechanical birds in " Twittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choke out their song . Klee was the master of infinite , disorienting space . In his small paintings , images float in an atmosphere so dreamlike that it 's hard to find a foothold . He believed passionately that art is in the process , not the product . His surfaces are often richly worked , built up of layers of paint @#  | and gesso , then etched all over in a tiny , fine hand . He believed painting could express motion and time . As a music lover and violinist , he sought a musical equivalent in his art work . In " Ad Parnassum " ( 1932 ) , a magnificent experiment inspired by Seurat , he created a harmony of form , line and colors , overlaid with meticulous rhythmic strokes . Feverish years : During the 1920s Klee 's " cool romanticism , " as he called it , flourished in the hothouse of the Bauhaus , where he taught along with Wassily Kandinsky . But by 1933 , the Nazis took power , and modern art came under attack . Klee tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " the sticky mud of the world of appearances . " He finally went into exile in Switzerland after the Nazis searched his house and suspended him from his post at the Dusseldorf Academy . In Bern , his birthplace , he found himself isolated from his artist cronies . He came down with scleroderma , the rare and devastating skin disease that would ultimately kill him . His work stagnated . Then , between 1937 and his death in June 1940 , he had a burst of activity . He produced 1,538 drawings in those feverish years . His line , once wispy , became bold ; his signs and symbols shattered into abstractions ; his once intimate canvases grew large . He continued to slip himself into the paintings : his initial " P " appears , his ubiquitous pipe is there , even a shape like a key ? a pun in French ( de ) on his name . As death approached , the world itself seemed on the brink of destruction . Figures in " Outbreak of Fear " ( 1939 ) and other paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick figures of a child 's art . When Klee died , an untitled still life with a vase and statue on a black ground was on his easel . In some ways it echoed his earlier work ; but it was also littered with his little signs . The image in the lower left was of a drawing he had recently made called " Angel , Still Ugly " ? a grotesquely crumpled Angel of Death . Perhaps a more poignant epitaph is a little picture he did earlier that year , of a stick figure called " Wandering Artist . " Here the space of Klee 's world is no longer infinite , but heavily bordered in black , cramping the hapless little man , who is waving goodbye . Alfred H. Barr Jr. , the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art , believed in the art of his time , and in 1930 Klee became one of the first living European artists to have a show at MOMA . Today director Richard E. Oldenburg is trying to carry out Barr 's spirit through the acquisition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upcoming summer show of German artists , " Berlinart 1961-1987 . " Encouraging the museum 's forward view are the trustees ; a number of them are avid contemporary collectors , including the architect Philip Johnson and the board 's new president , Donald B. Marron , chairman and CEO of Paine-Webber . Perfect antidote : But even in its splendidly expanded new quarters , MOMA is already squeezed for enough space to show large-scale contemporary work . The museum is not quick to bestow its imprimatur on new art in any case . " As you approach your own time , those choices are less secure , " notes Oldenburg . Besides , as Marron puts it , " The beauty of the Modern is that it puts contemporary work in the context of the past . " Which brings us back to Klee . A master of creative invention , he is the perfect antidote to art 's current obsession with appropriation ? plundering styles and images from past art and popular culture . " Seeing Klee is seeing that art is not exhaustible , " says Lanchner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its greatest strength still lies in making something old like Klee look new again . @#
