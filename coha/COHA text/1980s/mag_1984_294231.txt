A mass movement calls for a quicker return to full democracy <P> For weeks , Rio de Janeiro had been gearing up for the event . The words diretas j ( direct elections now ) became inescapable , splashed across posters , walls , buttons , T shirts and bumper stickers . Climbers scaled one of the peaks that surround the city and mounted a 35-ft. - high cloth banner bearing the slogan . At Maracana stadium , the huge electronic Scoreboard flashed the words repeatedly during soccer matches . The climax came last week , in Brazil 's biggest public demonstration ever . An estimated 1 million people swarmed into the plaza that surrounds Rio 's Candelria Church , raising clenched fists and chanting " Diretas j ! " Yet at times the six-hour rally had the flavor of carnaval , with a hot-air balloon , a laser light show and strains of a samba beat . Shortly after nightfall , politicians and major Brazilian entertainers brought the crowd to fever pitch with passionate speeches and songs . Declared Leonel Brizola , governor of the state of Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided between what happened before and what happened after this demonstration . " <P> At issue is the way in which Brazilians will take the next step in their country 's cautious return to democracy after two decades of military rule : the election of a successor to President Joao Figueiredo , 66 , a retired general whose six-year term expires in March 1985 . The government has decided that the choice will be made next January by a 686-member electoral college . But according to the latest polls , 80% of Brazil 's voters want a direct say in choosing their next leader . The public mood also reflects a lack of confidence in the government 's ability to deal with an economy beset by severe underemployment and unemployment ( 40% ) , runaway inflation ( 230% ) and the Third World 's highest foreign debt ( $96 billion ) . <P> Five years ago , the military men who had been governing Brazil since a 1964 coup decided that they would take major steps to return the country to civilian rule . An important move in that direction came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ballots for both local and state officials as well as for 502 members of the federal Congress . In a major defeat , the government-backed Social Democratic Party ( P.D.S. ) received only 38% of the popular vote ; the governorships often states as well as control of the House of Representatives fell into the hands of the Brazilian Democratic Movement ( P.M.D.B. ) and other opposition parties . But because the electoral college is disproportionately weighted in favor of the less populous northern states , which generally support the government , Figueiredo was able to keep control of the body . Not before 1991 , according to the government plan , will Brazilians vote directly for a President . Explained Figueiredo on national television last month : " Everything has its time and its hour .
