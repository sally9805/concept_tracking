The Christmas-season crash of a chartered DC-8 jet at Gander , Newfoundland , that killed all 248 military passengers and the crew of eight claimed another casualty last week . Arrow Air , the Miami-based company whose jet was ferrying home members of the U.S. Army 's 101st Airborne Division from Sinai peacekeeping duty , filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 . Of Arrow 's 500 employees , 400 were furloughed , and all but a handful of charter passenger and cargo flights were canceled . <P> The airline had been in turbulent financial condition ever since the Dec. 12 crash , which so far has mystified Canadian and U.S. investigators . Last week , though , the Canadian Aviation Safety Board reported that the crew had underestimated the weight of the plane 's passengers and baggage by at least six tons . Spurred by mounting pressure from Congress , the Federal Aviation Administration declared Arrow 's remaining fleet of ten DC-8s no longer airworthy because critical replacement parts had not been FAA certified , and the Air Force then suspended Arrow 's $21 million military-charter contract . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
