Picasso 's Genius <P> To the Editors : <P> In these times of riots , exploding mountains and angry Iranians , we needed to see Picasso on the cover of TIME May 26 . The extraordinarily beautiful painting and accompanying article on Picasso and his art provided a blissful , if temporary escape . <P> James Burnett <P> Dallas <P> Robert Hughes ' article was cogent , incisive , powerful-a word portrait worthy of Picasso 's Picassos . <P> Edie Brown Eisenberg <P> Woodmere , N. Y. <P> <P> You say , " The sense of the cubist moment can never come again . " Let 's fervently hope you are right . That such a hoax has lasted so long is a tragedy for serious painting . <P> Ken Downs Sr. <P> Islip , N. Y. <P> <P> Picasso painted women as though he truly hated them . Maybe our woman-hating society has something to do with his immense popularity . <P> Julie Crofoot <P> Emporia , Kans . <P> <P> Rioting in Miami <P> Although I smell a stench coming from the trial of the Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acts of those individuals who have used it as an excuse for murder , arson and pillage . What is destroyed in the end is not inequality , discrimination or injustice , but everyone 's rights and freedoms . <P> Dan O'Brien <P> Anchorage <P> <P> I am outraged at the recent acquittal of the four white policemen by an all-white jury in the brutal death of Arthur McDuffie .

Glazer <P> Orlando , Fla . <P> <P> No Justice , No Peace <P> I was pleased that the story on the march for jobs , peace and justice May 26 focused on the severe social and economic problems blacks and other minorities face in this country . Now we are faced not only with the cost of cleaning up Miami but also with the cost and lack of confidence in the justice system , and the continuing cost that poor education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be preceded by a balance of trade and by balancing the scales of justice . No jobs , no justice . No justice , no peace . This is not a threat , it is therapy . It is not talking about the problems of jobs and justice that will interfere with peace in our cities but the failure to respond to the just demands of the poor . <P> ( The Rev. ) Jesse L. Jackson <P> President , Operation PUSH <P> Chicago <P> The Tito Rites ( and Wrongs ) <P> Why should we blame President Carter for his rare display of courage in withstanding pressures to attend Tito 's funeral May 19 ? How could he , as a defender of human rights ? Too many Serbs and Croats whose relatives have been persecuted by Tito 's goons are still alive bearing witness to his inhumanity . <P> Kornelijs Purgalis <P> Seattle <P> The ERA Fight <P> In spite of losing the vote in Illinois , today 's women do not intend to give up the battle for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment May 26 .
