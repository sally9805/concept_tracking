Voters who go through the routine procedure of changing their party registrations do not ordinarily get gala receptions thrown in their honor or receive the personal congratulations of just about every bigwig in their new political tribe . But then Jeane Kirkpatrick is no ordinary voter . When the departing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations confided that she was severing a lifelong affiliation with the Democratic Party and planning to register as a Republican , G.O.P. officials gleefully scheduled a celebration bash for April 3 and sent out invitations decorated with a drawing of a dancing elephant . Just about every ranking Republican in Washington is expected to turn out for the affair , including the party 's dance master himself , Ronald Reagan . <P> Kirkpatrick , 58 , was considered a rising Republican star even before the switch . In four years at the U.N . she became known for her strongly anti- Marxist views and unapologetic willingness to use U.S. clout . Her academic credentials ( tenure at Georgetown University , four books ) and blunt rhetoric made her a hit on the lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last summer 's Republican National Convention in Dallas , where her attack on Democrats who " always blame America first " evoked a cheering response that all but brought the roof down . Says Terry Dolan , chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee : " She commands intense loyalty among conservatives . She could be the next Reagan . " Agrees Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf : " Her future is unlimited . " <P> Though she has never held elective office , Kirkpatrick 's following has grown to the point where she is increasingly viewed as national ticket material in 1988 . Dolan can even imagine a presidential race between her and Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca , running as a Democrat . More restrained assessments put her in the front rank of possible G.O.P. vice-presidential candidates . As Republican Political Consultant Lyn Nofziger notes , in a wry reference to Democrat Geraldine Ferraro 's groundbreaking 1984 bid for the job , " It would n't be the first time a woman had been nominated for Vice President . " Along with her appeal to male conservatives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldsmith , president of the National Organization for Women : " Whether she is a Democrat or a Republican is not relevant to NOW . She is an ERA supporter and an asset wherever she goes and under whatever cloak she wears . " Some G.O.P. conservatives are urging Kirkpatrick to make her move before 1988 by taking on moderate Republican Senator Charles Mathias in her home state of Maryland next year . If she won , they point out , she would not only gain a stepping-stone to the No. 2 spot in 1988 but also tighten the right 's grip on Republican reins . <P> Though Kirkpatrick has disclaimed any intention to seek elective office , she has carefully declined to rule out the possibility that she could be persuaded to change her mind in the future . When news of her impending registration change surfaced last week in Washington , she refused to discuss the matter , declaring that she could not engage in political discussions until her ambassadorial duties formally end on March 31 . " I 'm not denying it , " she said of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly clear that I had to think seriously about bringing my formal registration into line with my behavior and my views .
