Only two seats were at stake in last week 's all-white ballot for the South African Parliament , but the outcome sent shock waves through the nation . The big winner in the Transvaal provincial by-election was the ultra-right Conservative Party , which strengthened its grip on both rural seats by attacking every concession State President P.W . Botha has made in recent years to South Africa 's blacks . <P> Though the outcome scarcely threatened Botha 's control of Parliament , where his National Party holds 133 seats , vs. 22 for the Conservatives , it signaled a gathering white backlash . The extremists want to force all blacks to become citizens of tribal homelands , rather than of South Africa , and would reinstate the infamous pass laws that until two years ago determined where blacks could live and work . They also want to abolish the four-year-old tricameral system that permits Asians and people of mixed race to sit in Parliament , and seek to restore the ban on interracial marriage , repealed in 1985 . <P> As the by-elections approached , Botha went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month he banned 17 antiapartheid groups , including the United Democratic Front , an antigovernment umbrella group with some 2 million members . Just two days before the election , Cape Town police arrested Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu , two dozen other churchmen and more than 100 parishioners as they marched from St. George 's Cathedral to Parliament to protest the ban . Yet when the Afrikaner Resistance Movement , an extreme-right group that advocates an all-white South Africa , marched in Pretoria two weeks ago clad in brown shirts and carrying Nazi-like banners , police simply stood by . <P> The government further tightened the noose around opponents by introducing a bill last week that would prevent antiapartheid organizations from receiving foreign funds . Pretoria also informed the South African Council of Churches that it had committed " a criminal offense " by refusing to submit its monthly journal for review . <P> Botha called the Transvaal vote a " temporary disappointment , " blaming it on " foreign interference . " He has reason to worry . The next parliamentary elections are scheduled for 1989 , and if last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer inconceivable that victory would go to a right- wing opposition that makes Botha 's Nationalists look moderate .
