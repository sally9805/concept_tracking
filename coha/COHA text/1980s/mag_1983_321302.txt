Moscow sends mixed signals <P> The quietly organized meeting seemed to have been planned as the Soviet bloc 's answer to the Williamsburg summit . After all , if the heads of the six most powerful Western nations and Japan could use their conference in May to endorse NATO plans to deploy new nuclear missiles in Western Europe , the Soviets and their allies would want a chance to criticize the scheme in their own forum . But NATO members were in for a surprise . Instead of escalating the war of words , the seven Warsaw Pact leaders who gathered in Moscow last week issued a joint statement that was quite restrained . Said a puzzled Western diplomat in Moscow : " Why circle the wagons if you are not going to do anything ? " <P> The document criticized the " unprecedented " U.S. defense buildup . The Soviet Union and its allies , it said , would not " allow military superiority to be achieved over them . " But this oft-repeated warning stopped short of the heavyhanded Soviet hints dropped on the eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear missiles in Eastern Europe if NATO went ahead with its plan to install 572 U.S.-made Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles in five West European countries beginning in December . Some parts of the Warsaw Pact 's final statement were even conciliatory in tone . It noted that " no world problems , including the historical dispute between capitalism and socialism , can be solved by military means . " It dusted off old peace proposals calling for a freeze on military spending and urging both sides to pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons . <P> The modest change of signals came shortly after the Soviet Union rejected a plan first outlined by President Reagan last March in an effort to end the deadlock in the Geneva talks on intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe . The U.S. negotiators asked the Soviets to propose a limit of anywhere from zero to 450 on the number of warheads each side could deploy ; in effect , Washington was asking Moscow to trade some of its 360 SS-20 intermediate-range missiles , most of which are targeted on Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO plans to deploy . Previously , the U.S. had favored the " zero option , " according to which neither side would have any intermediate-range missiles in Europe . <P> During a visit to Southeast Asia last week , Secretary of State George Shultz said that the U.S. felt it deserved " a responsible answer " rather than a brusque nyet . In a response to critics who have charged that the Reagan Administration was not negotiating sincerely in Geneva , Shultz added , " There are those who argue that in negotiations you make an offer , and if nothing is forthcoming , you offer something else . That is stupid , because you are negotiating with yourself . The name of the game is to negotiate with the other side . "
