txt // in the military-industrial complex and a small band of psychic radicals who will destroy computers , weapon systems , and communication networks , perhaps even the minds of their opponents , by using their mighty PK powers . The only hope , he believes , is for Americans to accept the reality of psi and use it for peaceful purposes and for curing their medical ills . Elgin firmly believes in his own psi powers . Readers are urged to look up this incredible interview and also to read Elgin 's " Powers of Mind : The Promise and the Threat , " in New Realities , vol. 1 , no. 1 , 1977 . In their book Mind-Reach , reviewed in Chapter 30 , P and T devote a chapter to the " Loyal Opposition " in which I am heavily castigated for my Scientific American piece . Their section on this ( pages 180-181 ) is a masterpiece of deceptive writing . They vigorously deny that their NASAfunded experiment was a failure , asserting that Elgin achieved scores at odds of better than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test 's total failure during the only phase with adequate controls ; not a word about the shameless manner in which Elgin 's " rehabilitation " was achieved . P and T wrongly assert that I accused subjects of fraud when I clearly pointed out how easily unconscious bias could operate . They reprint their letter to Scientific American , with no mention of my reply or my earlier request for the opportunity to have an outsider examine the original tapes . Until those tapes are inspected by someone I respect , I can not accept the claim that the tapes support the data of Phase 1 . Even if they do , and my informant is wrong , it is only the failure of Phase 2 that matters and that remains the core of this unfortunate experiment . 8 Magic and Paraphysics The purpose of conjuring , at least most of the time , is to entertain audiences by pretending to violate natural laws . In a curious way this has something in common with how the universe behaves . When a person is mystified by a good magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magician did it . When a physicist is mystified by an unexpected observation it is because he ca n't figure out how the universe did it . The big difference , of course , is that the universe plays fair . Its tricks may operate by principles of incredible subtlety , and we may never discover all of them , but it keeps performing its illusions over and over again , always by the same methods . Or so it seems . If a scientist tries to discover one of the methods , the universe , so far as anyone can tell , does n't go out of its way to flimflam him . " God may be subtle but He is not malicious , " Einstein is often quoted as having said . Or , as he put it in a letter , " Nature hides her secrets through her intrinsic grandeur but not through deception . " The magician , by contrast , is a consummate liar . His principles , borrowed in part from physics and psychology ( but mostly they are sui generis ) , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprehensible sort . It is not so much what a magician says as what he implies . He will show the queen of hearts , turn it face down on top of the deck , and apparently deal it to the table . He may even say , " And we 'll place the queen over here , " knowing full well that the card he is putting // there is no longer the queen . But most of the time it is what the magician does , not what he says , that is deceptive . He may tap an object to prove it solid when only the spot he taps is solid . He may casually show the palm of his hand to prove he has nothing concealed when something is on the back of his hand . Any magician will tell you that scientists are the easiest persons in the world to fool . It is not hard to understand why . In their laboratories the equipment is just what it seems . There are no hidden mirrors or secret compartments or concealed magnets . If an assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually ) surreptitiously switch it for chemical B. The thinking of a scientist is rational , based on a lifetime of experience with a rational world . But the methods of magic are irrational and totally outside a scientist 's experience . The general public has never understood this . Most people assume that if a man has a brilliant mind he is qualified to detect fraud . This is untrue . Unless he has been thoroughly trained in the underground art of magic , and knows its peculiar principles , he is easier to deceive than a child . Some physicists also have not understood this . In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , a number of prominent scientists ( Oliver Lodge , William Crookes , John Rayleigh , Charles Richet , Alfred R. Wallace , and others ) were firmly persuaded that mediums , aided by discarnate " controls , " could levitate tables , materialize objects , and call up audible and even photographable spirits from the vasty deep . An Austrian astrophysicist , Johann Z ? 11ner , wrote a book called Transcendental Physics about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing insipid chalked messages from the dead on slates , and knots in closed loops of cord. , Zollner believed that Slade could move the cord in and out of four-space . It was as impossible for anyone to convince Z ? 11-ner that so charming a man as Slade could be a magician as it was impossible for Houdini to persuade Conan Doyle that he ( Houdini ) did not perform his escapes by dematerializing his body . And now the wretched story is happening all over again , with Uri Geller in the center of a cyclone of irrationalism that is churning over the Western world . Geller is a young , personable Israeli who began his spectacular career by performing what magicians call a " mental act " in Israeli night spots . An American parapsychologist , Andrija Puharich , discovered him , introduced him to Edgar Mitchell , the astronaut who once walked the moon and who now runs his own organization devoted to investigating the paranormal . Mitchell financed Geller 's trip to the United States and arranged for him to be tested at the Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former laser physicists now engaged in full-time psychic research . After a series of poorly designed experiments with Geller , Puthoff and Targ published their favorable findings in Nature . 2 // Although Puthoff and Targ are personally convinced of Geller 's ability to bend metal by PK ( psychokinesis ) and to perform even more remarkable miracles , their Nature report was limited to Geller 's power of ESP ( extrasensory perception ) . His most sensational feat was guessing correctly , eight times in a row , the number on a die that had been shaken in a metal file box by " one of the experimenters . " It later turned out that Geller had been allowed to handle the box , and that many prior trial runs had been made . Because the experimenters always shook the box before Geller was permitted to touch it , Geller 's handling seemed irrelevant , so it was not mentioned in the Nature report . This seemingly trivial detail gave Geller a splendid chance to obtain information by a technique known to conjurors.3 Had Puthoff and Targ been aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preclude it . The fact that they did not makes the dice experiment worthless . Puthoff and Targ are prominent among a small group of well-trained physicists , some with doctorates , who like to call themselves " paraphysicists . " Most of them are active in psychic research and in publishing popular books and articles . All are convinced that psi phenomena have been firmly demonstrated by parapsychologists . That the overwhelming majority of psychologists deny this is dismissed as the stubborn prejudice of Establishment science against what Thomas Kuhn calls a new " paradigm . " Paraphysicists look upon themselves as in the vanguard of a new scientific revolution that will be more shattering of old paradigms than the Copernican revolution . After all , they say , did not the establishment persecute Galileo ? In England the best known of this new breed of physicist is John Taylor , a mathematical physicist at King 's College , London . When the New Scientist conducted a poll of its readers in 1975 they found that Taylor was regarded as among the world 's top 20 scientists ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBC television , his popular books ( including one on black holes ) , and his loud espousal of the " Geller effect . " His latest book , Superminds , not only argues that Geller can bend spoons , keys , and metal bars by the power of his mind , but that hundreds of British superkids , teen-age and younger , can do the same thing.4 Oddly , Taylor never actually sees anything bend , nor has he been able to capture the actual bending on video . He calls this the " shyness effect . " Bending usually occurs only when nobody is looking . He has given his children crudely sealed tubes with a straight metal bar inside . They take the tubes home and come back with the bar bent . For some reason , which Taylor is unable to fathom , the children are successful only when the tubes are inadequately sealed . At Bath University , two psychologists designed a simple test for six young spoonbenders . The observer was told to relax his vigilance after // 20 minutes . Rods and spoons Gellerized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly videotaped through one-way mirrors . In every case where something bent , the children were seen doing the bending by " palpably normal means . " One little girl had to put a rod under her feet to bend it . Others held a spoon below a table and used two hands.5 Taylor had not thought it worth-while to design such a test because he had already decided that all his children were honest . Taylor is not sure what the mysterious force is that produces the Geller effect . In Superminds he considers many possibilities ? gravity , the weak force , neutrinos , tachyons , intermediate bosons , magnetic monopoles , quarks . Some of these have been proposed by other paraphysicists as the source of psi phenomena . Taylor finally opts for electromagnetism . This is scoffed at by parapsychologists because , following J. B. Rhine , they believe the psi force to be unknown to science . The possibility that the Geller effect may be caused by deception is , of course , ruled out by Taylor on the grounds that he personally witnessed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a strong compulsion to believe in paranormal events can be gained by considering a dramatic occasion at Birkbeck College , London , on June 21 , 1974 . Uri Geller was demonstrating his powers for a small group of physicists . The most distinguished man present was David Bohm , a world-renowned expert on quantum mechanics . Also present were paraphysicists John Hasted , Keith Birkinshaw , Ted Bastin , and Jack Sarfatt ( who has since restored his family name , Sarfatti ) , and psychic researcher Brendan O'Regan , who had arranged the demonstration . Geller 's outstanding achievement was producing a " very strong burst from a Geiger counter tube that he held in his hand . The creation of the burst happened almost simultaneously with Geller 's expressed intention to create it .... The creation of the burst was correlated with strong breathing and signs of great physical exertion on Geller 's part . " I quote from a stirring press release sent out by Sarfatti.6 Geller repeated the Geiger counter bit on the following day for the writer Arthur Koestler and others . " Koestler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Sarfatti , and was " visibly shaken for several minutes . " Science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke , also there , said it was time for the magicians to " put up or shut up . " " My personal professional judgment as a Ph.D . physicist , " Sarfatti concludes , " is that Geller demonstrated genuine psychoenergetic ability at Birkbeck , which is beyond the doubt of any reasonable man , under relatively well controlled and repeatable experimental conditions . " ? Note the clear implication in Sarfatti 's release that having his doctorate in physics made him specially qualified to rule out deception . Well , how would a magician with no Ph.D. , but with a knowledge not possessed by Sarfatti , have reacted had he been present ? Although I am not // much of a performer , magic has been my principal hobby for fifty years . When 1 read Sarfatti 's account , the first thing that occurred to me was that Geller could have had a piece of harmless radioactive substance concealed on his person . While twisting about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to his beta source . It could have been in the tip of a shoe , above his knee , in his mouth , behind an ear , under a collar , taped to his chest , in back of his belt . It is not hard to obtain a beta source . A luminous watch dial produces excellent crackling in a Geiger counter . When Philip Morrison once asked Sarfatti if anyone had examined Geller for a beta source , Sarfatti replied that no one had thought of such a possibility , and that it was an " ingenious idea . " Magicians find this response hilarious . Was it a " repeatable " experiment as Sarfatti 's release states ? Perhaps repeatable in front of Ph.D . paraphysicists , but not in front of knowledgeable magicians. ? Indeed , Geller 's methods are both old-fashioned and well known . The interested reader can learn most of them by reading the references cited in notes 2 and 3 . The publication of Geller 's methods has had , so far , little effect on the mind-sets of paraphysicists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their counterparts around 1900 when confronted with obvious fraud by a physical medium . First , they say , the fact that a magician can duplicate a psychic event does not mean the psychic does it that way . Second , even if he does sometimes do it that way it does n't mean that he does it that way all the time . Every paraphysicist now concedes that Geller occasionally cheats . After all , is not the poor lad under terrible pressure to produce results , especially on television ? How can you blame him for using a little prestidigitation when the psi power is not available ? If Geller is caught cheating , as he has been many times , so what ? Then he cheated . But when nobody catches him , what he does is genuine . This is one of those old **26;406;TOOLONG arguments which paraphysicists seem to find satisfying . At the moment , Sarfatti is director of what he calls the Physics/ Consciousness Research Group , a tax-exempt , nonprofit organization in San Francisco . The group is funded by Werner Erhard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , now running a movement of his own called est ( Erhard Seminars Training ) , designed to raise the consciousness of anyone willing to pay for its bizarre processing.9 Sarfatti is a leading theoretician among U.S. paraphysicists . According to his autobiography , written in 1975 for Ken Kesey 's new magazine , Spit in the Ocean , he was born in Brooklyn in 1939 and obtained his doctorate at San Diego State College . About ten years ago he began to have " odd subliminal experiences " which he attributes to " communication with other modes of consciousness . " He found he could practice " automatic writing " ( writing without conscious control of the hand ) and // several of his published scientific papers , he says , were written that way . He discovered he had " a kind of collective mind experience " with his associate and " comrade in psychic exploration , " physicist Fred Wolf . As his consciousness continued to soar , he was greatly aided by the est processing . In a 1975 letter to the magician James Randi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high probability that extraterrestrial contacts are being made . " This information comes " from sober and scientifically trained people with no axe to grind , " such as J. Allen Hynek , the astronomer who is now so active in UFO research . Sarfatti and Wolf are co-authors with Bob Toben of a wild paperback , SpaceTime and Beyond ( Dutton , 1975 ) . The text plus the cartoons will tell you all about the theoretical underpinnings of such things as time travel , levitation , precognition , and the ability to bend a spoon . Sarfatti 's theory of psi stems from David Bohm 's attempt to escape from the terrible discontinuities of quantum mechanics . In quantum theory one event seems to influence another without any transmission of energy through space or time . These bedrock discontinuities are utterly unlike those that occur on the macroscopic level . Rotate a beam of light and a spot will move across a wall , over an edge , then leap quickly to a more distant wall . But this leap is easily explained by considering the beam 's source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . An event happens at point A , another event at point B , but nothing propagates in between . We can do no better than " explain " the event by invoking statistical laws . Conventional quantum theory leaves no room for " hidden variables " ? something else about nature , as yet unknown to us , that would restore causality . Einstein did not like this vision of " God playing dice " ( as he called it ) and Bohm , although he posits no deity , is equally disturbed . In Bohm 's vision the universe has infinite levels of structure , like a vast sea without a bottom . On each level there are discontinuities that vanish when we perceive the patterns on the next level below . Beneath the entities of quantum mechanics are subquantum entities we do not yet understand . The entities we know are like tips of icebergs . We relate them by statistical laws only because we do not yet see how they are causally related on a deeper level . When we finally comprehend the deeper level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violations of cause and effect , that can be explained only by going still deeper . For all we know , these levels may go on forever . Our poor quantum mechanics is no more than an upper layer of what Milton called the world 's " dark unbottom 'd infinite Abyss . " Sarfatti elaborates . If we could but see the universe in what Bohm has called its " unbroken wholeness " we might see that every particle is connected with every other particle , every event with every other event , no matter how far away in space or time . Shake your finger , you shake the // universe . Wiggle something here , everything wiggles . Where Sarfatti departs from other physicists is in the language he chooses for describing the sub-quantum level . Sarfatti calls it " consciousness . " He is thus in the classic tradition of philosophical idealism . Behind the crazy , paradoxical world of everyday experience , behind the even crazier world of microphysics , is Mind . Into this ancient vision Sarfatti stirs several modern ingredients : the " Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Everett 's " many worlds " interpretation of quantum mechanics , and especially the implications of an argument advanced by John S. Bell . 10 Bell has shown that no local hidden variable theory ( that is , a set of equations to describe the properties at a point in space and time ) is consistent with quantum mechanics . This leaves open , however , the possibility that a nonlocal hidden variable theory ? one that applies to the entire universe ? may be consistent with quantum mechanics . There is not the slightest evidence for such a theory , but the logical possibility of such a theory ? one in which God does not play dice ? allows Sarfatti and others to posit it . Think of the world as an immense , intricate puppet show . Everything has a " string " attached to it , and the strings are all held by the Great Puppeteer . It looks as though puppet A throws a particle to puppet B , but this is an illusion . The Puppeteer moves A 's arm , then carries the particle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . No matter how random and acausal events seem on the microlevel , causality is restored by positing the Great Puppeteer . Jung called it " synchronicity . " Leibniz called it " pre-established harmony . " Whatever you call the Puppeteer ? God , Being , the Tao , Brahmin , the Absolute ? its infinite strings provide a connectedness that permits the transfer of information at instantaneous speeds through space and time . Such a transfer must not be thought of as violating relativity 's dictum that signals can not go faster than light . There are no instant signals in the sense that energy is transferred . Nothing " moves . " No time " elapses . " It is what Sarfatti calls " instant superluminal transfer " of information by means of " hyperdynamical connection . " In our metaphor , a puppet tugs a string here , the Great Puppeteer instantly tugs a string there . The concept is simple , but the paraphysicist makes it sound scientific by hoking it up with technical jargon . The " measure of information , " according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy already existing at a particular place . This kind of information is coded directly to the superluminal de Broglie quantum matter waves . " It is Sarfatti 's persuasion that the human mind has natural detectors of de Broglie waves on the quantum molecular level . " The introduction of this kind of direct quantum information into waking consciousness often appears as'paranormal ' or'psychic . ' Certain kinds of altered states of consciousness .. . seem to facilitate awareness of direct quantum information . ... " I I // There is more . Not only can the psychic pick up information instantly from any part of the universe , he can also transmit it instantly . He simply uses his PK powers to wiggle a wave function here ? possibly by altering the spin-state of a quantum system ? and presumably wiggling it with some kind of code . Since this wiggles everything , the receiving psychic can pick it up instantly . If an establishment physicist does n't buy this , Sarfatti and his friends consider him hopelessly mired in " electromagnetic chauvinism . " ( Poor John Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is mired in electromagnetic chauvinism . ) Here , at long last , is a truly marvelous theory for explaining all the mind-blowing , spoon-bending wonders of psi . Information can be conveyed instantly into the skull of anyone , especially if he is psychic , from any part of the universe , from anywhere in the past , present or future . Telepathy , clairvoyance , psychokinesis , poltergeists , precognition , psychic healing , out-of-body experiences , and so on , no longer suffer from the lack of a physical theory . Our consciousness , according to Sarfatti and others , can instantly perceive and influence any part of the universe . It can leave the body and roam , faster than a photon , through endless reaches of space and time . If a superintelligence in some distant galaxy wishes to communicate with Uri Geller and give him the power to bend a spoon , there is no reason why it ca n't . Indeed , this is just what Puharich claims is the source of Geller 's power . 12 Geller himself has validated this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John G. Fuller . 13 This is not the place to go into more details about Sarfatti 's great theory of " superluminal information transfer . " I wish to consider a much humbler matter . Before the paraphysicist develops elaborate theories to explain how Geller can bend a spoon , would it not be wise to make sure first that Geller actually can bend a spoon ? By PK , that is . Now I do not wish to get into trouble with magician friends by exposing methods used by honest charlatans , but perhaps they will forgive me if I consider in detail Uri 's most publicized feat . How does Geller bend a car key ? First , it is important to understand that there is no single method . There are dozens of ways to bend car keys , some of them developed by magicians after Geller made the trick popular , and which Geller never uses because they are too complicated and not adaptable to his casual , impromptu brand of magic . But Geller himself has many ways of bending keys , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a reporter or a Gellerite who has asked for a private demonstration , he will do it one way . If he is in front of a large audience he adopts other procedures . The method he uses depends on who is watching , how many are watching , and how closely they are watching . If he suspects a magician is watching , he wo n't bend the key at all . Here is a typical scenario based on the observation of many friends , some of them magicians whom Geller did not know were present and who // actually saw his exact " moves . " Let 's assume Geller is in an office with a group of scientists gathered to witness his awesome powers . Some of them believe Geller has those powers . Others are skeptical but curious . None knows much about magic . In performing for such an audience Geller has one overwhelming psychological advantage over every magician : he comes on as a psychic . A magician is expected to perform his miracles rapidly and cleanly , without fail , while everyone watches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he gets up to perform , dares say , " I 'm sorry , ladies and gentlemen . I intended to show you my great trick of floating a burning light bulb across the room , but unfortunately I do n't feel like doing it . There are skeptics in the audience . The vibes are unfavorable . " The psychic , on the other hand , is under no obligation to do anything , and Geller plays this role with superb skill . He begins by saying that he is very nervous , being in such distinguished company , and he does n't know whether anything will happen or not . All he can do is try . Things are more likely to happen , he says , if everyone wants them to happen . The power he has is not peculiar to himself . Everybody has it . So ? if everyone will try their best to make things happen , maybe they will . But do n't be disappointed if they do n't . This little speech has the effect of discouraging skeptics from voicing doubts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that conditions do not permit him to do much . Most of all it allows him plenty of time to perform the most trivial of tricks . No magician could possibly get away with taking half an hour to make a key bend , but this often happens with Geller . He will borrow a car key , stroke it , nothing happens . He will put it aside and try later . Again nothing happens . Perhaps on the third or fourth try it will bend . The reason for this delay is that Geller can not bend the key until he obtains strong enough misdirection to bend it secretly . The secret bending takes only an instant . Most car keys bend easily , especially if they are long and have a low-cut notch . Geller prides himself on his strength ( he works out with bar bells , Puharich tells us ) . If you have strong fingers you can bend most car keys simply by resting the key crosswise on the fingers and pressing firmly with the thumb . Stronger keys require pressing the tip against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of a chair , or whatever firm surface is handiest . In any case , the bending can be done in a split second . Of course it must be done at a moment when no one is looking . To obtain the necessary misdirection Geller creates a maximum amount of chaos by moving around the room and going quickly from one experiment to another . Here are some of the ploys he has used to get the needed misdirection. 1 . Geller has tried twice to bend a key but without success . He tries a third time , letting someone hold the base of the key while he gently strokes // it with a finger . Again nothing happens . Geller acts disappointed . Everyone is disappointed . He starts to put the key aside once more . No one is paying much attention because the trick has failed . At that instant someone in the room makes a funny remark . Everyone turns toward him and laughs . It is the moment Geller has been waiting for . His hand drops to the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained magician would be watching his hand at that instant ? Geller immediately puts the key aside , carefully placing it in a spot where it is partly concealed so that no one can see the bend . He may not try the key again for another ten minutes . 2 . Geller is performing for one person . Both are seated in chairs . The key fails to bend . Perhaps , Geller says , they are sitting too far apart . To move his chair closer , Geller 's hands drop to the sides of the chair . As he moves the chair , the tip of the key is pressed against the chair 's leg . 3 . Geller is in his own apartment entertaining a guest . He sits on a sofa behind his glass-topped coffee table . There seems to be nothing near him he can use for a pressure bend . Who would guess that the thick glass of the coffee table will serve admirably ? As soon as a bit of misdirection occurs , and the spectator 's attention is diverted , the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Geller is entertaining a group of people in an office . They are watching too closely for him to obtain the misdirection he needs . Geller is apologetic . Sometimes it helps the metal bend , he says , if there is a lot of metal nearby . He points across the room and asks , " Is that a metal file cabinet ? " If he is in a living room he points to a radiator . Every head turns . In that instant his hand lowers and puts in the work . If the key is weak he bends it in his hand . All he has to do now is hold the key at one end , concealing the bend , walk to the file cabinet , let someone hold an end of the key , then miraculously bend it . 5 . On many occasions Geller finds it necessary to leave the room to obtain strong misdirection . In 1974 when he was performing for a group of people in Ottawa , a friend of mine in the audience told me that , after many failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elevator in the hallway . The large amounts of metal in the shaft , he said , might help . Geller then dashed into the hallway , his spectators trailing . Sure enough , in front of the elevator door the key bent . 6 . Another one of Geller 's favorite excuses for leaving the room is to say that running water helps a key bend . He actually used this preposterous excuse on the paraphysicists at Birkbeck College . Let me quote the relevant passage from Sarfatti 's ecstatic press release : " Geller then succeeded in bending several pieces of metal by psychoenergetic action . These objects included the blade of a knife and a key belonging to Bohm . The flow of water from a tap onto the metal seemed to make the bending occur more easily . " // To a magician this means that the paraphysicists had been watching too closely . Geller suggested flowing water . Everybody moved to a spot where the key could be held under a tap . In the process of getting there , Geller obtained the needed misdirection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the side of a doorway as he passed through , or in a dozen other ways . The point is : no one is watching on the way to the sink . It is important to realize that Geller puts the bend in the key before , sometimes long before , he pretends that the actual bending takes place . Let 's suppose he finds a chance to bend the key after a second failure . The key has been put aside , but behind something or partly under something so the bend is not visible . Ten minutes later , when he picks up the key again , he holds it so that only half the key projects from his fingers . Because the visible half is straight , everyone assumes the entire key is straight . Sometimes he rubs the bent key back and forth across a table top . The action and sound strengthen the impression that the key is flat . The key is then given to someone to hold at one end while Geller 's fingers surround the bend . While Geller is gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to feel warmer . Since it is being handled , it is getting warmer , but most people respond readily to suggestion and imagine that the key is feeling much warmer . Geller continues to rub the key . Slowly he lowers his fingers and allows the bend to come into view . It really looks as if the key is bending at that moment , especially if that is what you are convinced is happening . Geller is a master at creating this illusion . He will see to it that the flat side of the key is toward the audience as he lowers his fingers . Then he will twist the key gradually to bring the bend slowly into view . At the same time he will shout excitedly , " Look ! It 's starting to bend ! " All this combines to create a strong illusion . Many people will swear later that they saw the key slowly bend , the way a match bends while it is burning . Sometimes Geller will hand a key , already bent after an earlier " failure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Geller may ask him to hold the key by its tip but above his head where he ca n't see it is already bent . Geller will then announce that he is going to attempt something he seldom does . He is going to move across the room , ten feet away , and try to bend the key without even touching it . The person holding the key naturally assumes it is unbent . Geller , ten feet away , tries hard to make the key bend . He walks forward , examines the bent key , and acts tremendously disappointed . Nothing has happened ! Before the spectator has looked at the key ? why should he examine it since the key clearly failed to bend ? ? Geller is anxious to try once more . The key goes back in the person 's hand , the hand is raised . Geller moves twenty feet away . Now he feels the power surging through him ! He breathes heavily and seems to be undergoing considerable stress . // Yes ? he knows the key is bending ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suggestible he imagines he does . Geller tells him to look at the key . Mirabile dictu ! It is bent 30 degrees ! To his dying day the spectator will insist that Geller was 20 feet away when he caused the key to bend . Moreover , he will insist , Geller never touched the key . Over and over again , reporters whose keys Geller has bent in this way have written that Geller bent their keys without touching them . What they mean is that Geller was not touching the keys at the times they assumed they were bending . The fact that Geller handled the keys many times before the great miracles occurred seems totally irrelevant . Indeed , they forget this entirely . These are a few of the dodges Geller uses for just one of his little miracles . I have not mentioned all of his key-bending techniques . For example , I have said nothing about how Geller can be secretly aided by his friend , Shipi Shtrang , who is often with him , sometimes disguised as one of the innocent spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooge " for him . The use of stooges , a term magicians use for secret assistants , is a branch of magic in itself . And I have omitted other methods , not using stooges , because they are being employed by magician friends who are now more skillful at key bending than Geller . Magicians are , of course , under the enormous disadvantage of being known as magicians . As a result , they are expected to bend a key under conditions far more stringent than those demanded for Geller . A Gellerite will approach the Amazing Randi with his fist closed over a key . " You claim you can do anything Geller does , " he will say . " Okay , I have my car key inside my first . Now let 's see you make it bend . " " May I inspect the key ? " Randi asks . " You may not , " says the angry Gellerite . " The key is in my fist . Make it bend without touching it . That 's exactly what Geller did when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He may feebly protest that those were not the conditions under which Geller bent the key , but what Gellerite is going to believe him ? There are two traits that characterize the true Gellerite . He is a person of enormous gullibility , the gullibility strengthened by an enormous compulsion to believe . And he is a person incapable of recognizing the absurd . ( If he is a physicist , I would add a third trait : the egotism of believing he is competent to detect fraud . ) In the heyday of spiritualism , the physicists who were convinced that spirits could float trumpets through the air were not in the least amused by the singular fact that spirits could do this only in total darkness . Why should the dear departed operate only in the dark ? To a magician the answer is obvious . If Geller has the power to bend metals , why is it necessary to bend them only under the conditions of a magic performance ? ! f ( ; ellcr possesses // paranormal powers , why do they manifest themselves in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend a metal bar by PK , why ca n't he straighten it again ? The feats performed by Geller 's chief rivals are even funnier . Ted Serios , a Chicago bellhop , persuaded such leading parapsychologists as Thelma Moss , Charles Tart , Gertrude Schmeidler , William Cox , and Jule Eisenbud that he could cause his memory of old photographs to register on Polaroid film merely by looking into the lens through a roll of paper that he held in front of the lens . When two magicians explained how easily Serios could have faked it , Serios lost his power and faded from the psi scene.14 Yet not one of the parapsychologists mentioned above has altered his or her opinion of the genuineness of Serios 's power . The leading PK performer in Russia is Nina Kulagina , who makes objects move across a table and ping-pong balls float in space . American magicians , who have seen her only on film , are enormously unimpressed. 1 s Dean Kraft , a Brooklyn boy , made a stir two years ago when he was written up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen follow him across a rug and pieces of candy hop out of a bowl . He soon gave this up ( too much of a strain , he says ) to become a psychic healer . Curing the sick seems to be much easier for him than moving pens . He now treats , he claims , about 30 patients a day . His healing is all " free , " but patients donate to a fund set up for him by Judy Skutch , one of the early financial backers of Geller . Another recent PK wonder in the United States is Felicia Parise , a former medical assistant at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn . After seeing a film about Kulagina , Parise discovered that she , too , could make corks , tinfoil , and bottles move and roll across a table . She was discovered by Charles Honorton , then director of parapsychology research at the Maimonides Medical Center . According to Honorton , Parise put a small plastic bottle on the formica top of her kitchen counter , concentrated , and the bottle moved two inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " this distinguished parapsychologist told a reporter . " I virtually took it apart to ensure that there was no mechanical aid she could have used .... But 1 found none . " Has Parise discovered the invisible nylon threads magicians sometimes use ? Who knows ? Honorton made no effort to have her observed by a qualified magician. 17 " It seems to me , " wrote Conan Doyle in The Coming of the Fairies , " that with fuller knowledge and with fresh means of vision , these people are destined to become just as solid and real as the Eskimos . " By " people " Doyle meant tiny creatures with filmy wings that two girls had photographed in the woods of Yorkshire . ' 8 Substitute " psi energies " for " people , " and " laws of present-day physics " for " Eskimos , " and you have the heart of what the paraphysicists are trying to tell us. 19 // Postscript The following letter from Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ was printed in Technology Review , October/November 1976 : In Martin Gardner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to the work with Uri Geller at Stanford Research Institute . Unfortunately , Gardner 's statements concerning what happened at S.R.I. and what we published are grossly in error . We therefore wish to inform your readers of the facts involved , all of which can be independently verified on the basis of information available in the public domain . To begin , Gardner states that " Although Puthoff and Targ are personally convinced of Geller 's ability to bend metal by PK ( psychokinesis ) and to perform even more remarkable miracles , their Nature report was limited to Geller 's power of ESP ( extrasensory perception ) . " Gardner is wrong on both counts . We are in fact not convinced of teller 's ability to bend metal , and our negative findings were reported in the very Nature article to which Gardner refers ( R. Targ and H. Puthoff , vol. 252 , No. 5476 , p. 604 ) : " It has been widely reported that Geller has demonstrated the ability to bend metal by paranormal means . Although metal bending by Geller has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to combine such observations with adequately controlled experiments to obtain data sufficient to support the paranormal hypothesis . " A more detailed statement is found in the S.R.I. film , Experiments with Uri Geller , the text of which was released accompanying a March 6 , 1973 , presentation at a Columbia University physics colloquium . With regard to metal bending , the text states : " One of Geller 's main attributes that had been reported to us was that he was able to bend metal .... In the laboratory we did not find him able to do so . . . . it becomes clear in watching this film that simple photo interpretation is insufficient to determine whether the metal is bent by normal or paranormal means . . . . It is not clear whether the spoon is being bent because he has extraordinarily strong fingers and good control of micro-manipulatory movements , or whether in fact the spoon turns to plastic ' in his hands , as he claims . " In discussing our dice-box experiment , Gardner goes on to claim that the reported run of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected out of a longer run which included " many prior trial runs . " That is completely false . The facts are exactly as reported in the Nature paper and in the S.R.I. film . The experiment was performed ten times , with Uri passing twice and giving a correct response eight times . These ten trials were the only ten ; they were not selected out of a longer run ? there were no prior trials nor follow-up trials , as Gardner claims . Gardner 's errors appear to be due to his taking at face value the erroneous speculations of Geller 's self-appointed debunker , the Amazing Randi . My reply to the letter above appeared in the same issue : // I have enormous admiration for the expertness of Puthoff and Targ in one field ? verbal obfuscation . Let me take each of their two counts in turn : Count 1 . When I say that Puthoff and Targ are " personally convinced " of Geller 's ability to bend metal , I use the phrase in the ordinary language sense , as when an astronomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our galaxy . It is a probability estimate , as are all scientific beliefs . When Puthoff and Targ deny they are convinced Geller can bend metal , they mean they are not " convinced " because they have not proved such ability in their laboratory . Privately , in letters and conversation , they have expressed their personal beliefs that Geller has such ability . If Puthoff and Targ wish to make precise their present beliefs about Geller 's PK powers , let them give it as a probability estimate : How do they now rate the probability that Geller has PK ability ? If they rate it low , it means they have changed their minds . In my article I said that Jack Sarfatti , the paraphysicist who first staked his reputation on the PK powers of Uri Geller , but who recently branded Geller a fraud , " did not doubt " that others have PK ability . Sarfatti telephoned me to say that this is not true . He does doubt the existence of PK . He then added that he doubts " everything " except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt even my own existence ? for all I know I may be just a figment in the Red King 's dream ( consult Lewis Carroll 's Through The Looking Glass ) . When I said Sarfatti does not doubt PK , I meant it only in the ordinary language sense , as when a physicist says he does not doubt electromagnetism . Count 2 . I did not say in my article that in the dice-box test Puthoff and Targ selected ten guesses out of a longer run . I said that many " prior trial runs " had been made . A trial run , in ordinary language , is a practice run . Yet every time someone points out that practice runs were made with the dice-box , Puthoff and Targ obfuscate by denying that the ten guesses were " selected " from previous trials . They were not so selected . But that is not the point . The point is that a very large number of practice runs were made during which Geller was allowed to handle the box . This gave him all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final test of ten trials was made . That was all I said and all I meant . Anyone reading the letter from Puthoff and Targ would assume that there were no practice runs . Without drawing upon private information , I content myself with the following published data : ? In the July , 1973 , issue of Psychic there are two photographs of Geller performing the dice-box test . In the first picture we see Geller recording his guess of the die 's face , the closed box about four inches from his hand , while Targ watches . In the second , we see Geller opening the box to check on his guess . We assume it is the box used in the famous test because we see S.R.I. printed on top . In the obfuscatory Puthoffian-Targian dialect , this is not a " follow-up trial " because it is not part of the test they reported . ? In John Wilhelm 's carefully researched book , The Search for Superman , just published by Pocket Books , there is a report on dice-box tests conducted in Geller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although Puthoff insists it was vigorous enough to " ensure an honest shake . " Commented // Targ : " He 's like a kid in that he had something that made a lot of noise and he just shook and shook it . " Targ also told Wilhelm that in the famous run of ten Geller was allowed to place his hands on the box in a dowsing fashion . Targ told Wilhelm that S.R.I. has a good-quality videotape of another dice test in which Geller , five times in a row , correctly wrote down the die 's number before the box was shaken . Targ first shook the box , then Geller took it and dumped out the die . Since magicians familiar with dice cheating know a variety of ways to control a fair die when it is dumped out of a box , how about letting magicians see this valuable videotape ? Why keep it top secret ? Targ was so impressed by this test that he told Wilhelm he suspects that , even in the run of ten that they reported , Geller probably used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later " would see when he opened the box . " Note : Targ said it was Geller who opened the box ! In the sound track of the S.R.I. film from which Puthoff and Targ quote in their letter , the following occurs : " Here is another double-blind experiment in which a die is placed in a metal file box . . . . The box is shaken up with neither the experimenter nor Geller knowing where the die is or which face is up . This is a live experiment that you see ? in this case , Geller guessed that a four was showing but first he passed because he was not confident . You will note he was correct and he was quite pleased to have guessed correctly , but this particular test does not enter into our statistics . " Now Puthoff and Targ have not , so far as I know , revealed whether this single trial , which was recorded on videotape , was part of the test of ten trials . If it was not , then surely it was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire dice-box test was recorded on videotape . In the interest of scientific truth , Puthoff and Targ should make this entire videotape available to inspection by magicians . It then could be determined unequivocally whether the theory suggested by James Randi , as to how Geller might have cheated , is a viable one . Come , gentlemen , let us see the entire tape ! If we are wrong , we will humbly apologize . Martin Gardner Much has happened since . Taylor has reversed his opinion of metal bending ( see Chapter 16 of this book ) . P and T are doing their best to forget about Uri as they devote their energies to research on clairvoyance , or what they prefer to call " remote viewing " ( see Chapter 30 ) . Incidentally , Puthoff recently disclosed to a friend of mine some startling new information about the famous ten-shake die test . It did not take place at one time , said P , but was extended over a period of several days ! This answers the third of eleven questions that psychologist Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psychology of the Psychic , Prometheus Books , 1980 , a book he wrote with David Marks ) sent to Puthoff in 1978 . Some of the other questions were : Which trials were actually videotaped and which other trials were filmed ? Which trials were neither taped nor filmed , and which were both ? // Were the trials all conducted in one room at SRI , or were some done in other rooms ? Were some done in Uri 's motel room ? Were the videotapes or films run continuously during each trial , or were they at some time switched off ? Is there any reason why you chose a " pass " trial to include in the SRI film on Geller ? Was this one of the two pass trials reported in the Nature article ? Is it possible to learn the time that Geller took on each trial after the die was shaken ? This letter was never answered . This was typical of a long history of evasions and nonresponses that Kammann and Marks experienced with P and T , including their persistent refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know exactly what happened during the die test unless Uri some day decides to tell all . Sarfatti responded to my article with a long letter to Technology Review ( March/April 1977 ) : I wish to comment on Martin Gardner 's article , " Magic and Paraphysics , " which contains extensive descriptions of my research , opinions , and speculations . 1 . My name was not changed from Sarfatt to Sarfatti . Rather , my original name was officially restored to me . My father 's name was Hyman Sarfatti. 2 . My Ph.D . in physics is not from San Diego State College , which does not grant that degree . It is from the University of California at Riverside . ( I was an assistant professor of physics at San Diego State College . ) I have also studied with David Bohm at the University of London and with Abdus Salam at the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste. 3 . I am open to the possibility of extra-terrestrial communication from advanced civilizations . However , I do not uncritically or dogmatically believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain a healthy skepticism of the increasing flow of subjective and circumstantial evidence reported by people in responsible positions that allude to extra-terrestrial contact by means other than electromagnetic signals . It is definitely a misrepresentation to identify my position with that of Andrija Puharich and Uri Geller . Contrast my view of the extra-terrestrial question with that of Dr. Frank Drake , director of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center at Cornell . In his article , " On Hands and Knees in Search of Elysium " ( Technology Review , June , 1976 ) we find statements such as : " All the S.E.T.I. Search for Extraterrestrial Life people have been tantalized by the belief that there are alien radio signals passing through our offices and homes which could be detected now with existing equipment if we but knew in which direction and on which frequency to listen " ( p. 25 ) . Dr. Drake 's position is much more certain about the possibility of extraterrestrial communication than even I am ! // // Both S.E.T.I. and my organization , the Physics/Consciousness Research Group ( PCRG ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sane and desirable . S.E.T.I. thinks extra-terrestrials almost certainly exist , that they will communicate by electromagnetic signals and that no earthperson has yet received such signals . PCRG entertains the possibility that extra-terrestrials exist and that they may choose to use another means apparently allowable within the formal structure of quantum mechanics , namely superluminal quantum communication . An experiment being conducted by Aspect ( its design is reported in Physics Letters , 54A , August 25 , 1975 ) is capable of disproving the superluminal quantum communication possibility . If Aspect 's experimental results are negative and are confirmed , then PCRG will no longer entertain the superluminal possibility . 4 . I deny Mr. Gardner 's statement , " Sarfatti does not doubt that PK powers exist . " I do doubt that PK powers ? and superluminal information transfer ? exist . However , I am open to the possibility of their existence since quantum mechanics apparently has room for them , e.g. , John A. Wheeler 's " participatory " and Eugene Wigner 's " consciousness " interpretations of quantum measurement . The recent paper by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 5559 , November 8 , 1976 ) provides strong support for the superluminal information transfer interpretation of the quantum theory . Thus , Professor Stapp writes : " If the statistical predictions of quantum theory are true in general and if the macroscopic world is not radically different from what is observed , then what happens macroscopically in one space-time region must in some cases depend on variables that are controlled by experimenters in far-away , space-likeseparated regions . . . . The central mystery of quantum theory is how does information get around so quick ? ' . . . How does the information about what is happening everywhere else get collected to determine what is likely to happen here ? . . . Quantum phenomena provides prima facie evidence that information gets around in ways that do not conform to classical ideas . Thus the idea that information is transferred superluminally is , a priori , not unreasonable . " Superluminal information transfer , if it exists , would surely be used for communications by an advanced extra-terrestrial civilization that did not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a few million to really check out the quantum superluminal possibility before spending billions of dollars on electromagnetic searches such as Project Cyclops ? S.E.T.I. , in ignorance of the possible quantum alternative , seems to want to settle the issue of rival forms of extraterrestrial communication without debate . PCRG does not intend to let that happen . If Cyclops would be of value for purely scientific reasons , independent of the extra-terrestrial issue , then perhaps it should be supported . But the creators of the project have not made that clear to the public . 5 . Mr. Gardner writes : " . . . the concept of superluminal information it up with technical jargon . The'measure of information , ' according to Sarfatti , is ' the degree of order in the energy already existing at a particular place .... This is more than hoking with technical jargon . For example , David Hawkins writes : " . . . the physical concept of work , as distinguished from energy , has itself an informational aspect . The performance of ' useful work ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or information . It is to inform a physical system in some way , to transfer order or information to it . To say that free energy is energy available for external work is to say that order can not come into existence ex nihilo , but only by transfer " ( Language of Nature , p. 216 ) . Since Lord Kelvin in the nineteenth century , the notion of order as the thermodynamic quality of energy has been well established . The new idea I present is of a nonlocal , superluminal ( i.e. , space-like ) transfer of the quality of energy , not the amount of energy . I suggest that the essence of quantum theory is the nondynamical transfer of order ( i.e. , quality of energy ) without the dynamical transfer of energy through space . As Schrodinger wrote of the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky effect : " It is rather discomforting that quantum theory should allow a system to be steered or piloted into one or another type of state at the experimenter 's mercy in spite of his having no access to it " ( Proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . 6 . Werner Erhard 's support of PCRG does not imply that Mr. Erhard or est ( Erhard Seminars Training ) fully endorse every action and policy of PCRG , or vice versa . PCRG is not a part of est . Mr. Erhard and I share a warm personal relationship that enriches both our lives independent of ideological and scientific beliefs , Jack Sarfatti I once mentioned to a high official of est that Sarfatti had ended a leter by saying that he and Werner Erhard shared a " warm personal relaionship . " The official laughed and said , " Werner does n't have a warm personal relationship with anybody . " In any case , after est turned down larfatti 's request for new funding for his PCRG , Sarfatti became a bitter oe of est , mailing out endless press releases accusing Erhard of being a tative fascist . In recent years Sarfatti has been promoting an invention , br which he has pending patents , designed to transmit coded informaion faster than light . I know of no other physicist who thinks it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest physicists of all ime . As I write , Bantam Books is about to reprint Space-Time and 3eyond . I know of no more knuckleheaded volume than this . Even Sar'atti now agrees . He has broken with his two former collaborators and ias refused to allow his name on the new edition , as revised by Toben. ' he agent , by the way , who sold the original book to Dutton was none // in 1981 while awaiting trial in Philadelphia for the murder of his girlfriend , Holly Maddux . I wrote to John Macrae III , president of Dutton , to get confirmation of his plans to allow Bantam to reprint . His reply contains a classic statement that deserves airing . " Whether the book is or is not sound , or , as you say , valueless , is beyond my capacity to judge . " No doubt . But are not responsible publishing houses obligated to send science books , which they are not competent to judge , to professionals for evaluation before they publish ? Morally obligated , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has great potential for meeting the public 's hunger for scientific hogwash . Wilbur Franklin , the Kent State paraphysicist mentioned in my last note , died unexpectedly in the spring of 1978 . His most sensational psi claim had been in an article reprinted in The Geller Papers , edited by Charles Panati . Using an electron microscope , he had examined a fracture that Uri had produced in a platinum ring and concluded that the unusual fracture surfaces could only have been produced by paranormal means . Not until 1977 did he discover his error . A reexamination of the fracture disclosed , to Franklin 's vast dismay , that the crack had occurred at an incomplete braze where the jeweler had attached the ring 's shank to the part of the ring holding the gemstone . Franklin conceded that mechanical pressure could easily have caused the break , though he continued to believe that Geller had broken the ring paranormally . His sad letter about this mistake appeared in the Humanist , September/October 1977 . That same year the Chicago Journal obtained a spoon broken by Uri in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a pile of some 30 spoons on a table . A test spoon of similar type was then broken by bending it back and forth until the fatigued metal snapped . The two spoons were sent to a consulting firm for examination by electron microscope . The examination failed to show any difference between the two fractures . Details were reported in the Journal 's January 19 , 1977 , issue . Uri 's usual method of bending spoons on stage is to have one of his assistants , disguised as a spectator , bring up one or more spoons that have been fatigued to the extent that stroking will cause the spoon to bend and break at the weakened spot . No self-respecting magician would stoop to performing such kindergarten feats , but gullible Gellerites think they are witnessing miracles . 9 The Irrelevance of Conan Doyle There are some trees , Watson , which grow to a certain height and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity . You will see it often in humans . Conan Doyle , The Adventure of the Empty House What has that eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. S. Eliot Questions similar to Eliot 's can be asked about many another famous scrivener whose name has been associated with allegedly fictional char-acters . What has that sixteenth-century Spanish drifter and one-armed soldier to do with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza ? What has that kinky-haired , pie-faced French mulatto , lecher , spendthrift , and literary hack to do with Athos , Porthos , Aramis , and d'Artagnan ? The answer , of course , is " Nothing . " The case of Cervantes is partic-ularly instructive , because it has so much in common with that of Conan Doyle . The two books about the adventures of the Knight of La Mancha tell the story of a long friendship between a dreamer ? yet man of action ? and his faithful down-to-earth companion . We now know , thanks to the recent efforts of Spanish scholars , that these adventures were written , not by Cervantes , but by Sancho Panza . After the death of his master , // Sancho sold his memoirs to Cervantes , who , scoundrel that he was , kept them hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have suspected this long before the truth came out . Cervantes had little interest in Don Quixote . It was his poetry and plays , all written in a careful , classical style , of which he was proud . Only because he was seriously in debt did he allow his name to appear on Sancho 's sprawling , carelessly written work . Sancho was , of course , a much greater writer than Cervantes . He was far from the slow-witted person he made himself out to be , but like James Boswell and John Watson he modestly underplayed himself to pay greater homage to his friend . Unfortunately , his stories about the Don were written in his old age , when his memory was starting to fade , and they are filled with lapses that Cervantes would never have allowed to remain in the manuscript had he troubled to go over it carefully . Cervantes had so little interest in the first half of Sancho 's memoirs that it was not until ten years later , when he desperately needed money again , that he issued the sequel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he tried to explain the contradictions he had failed to catch in the earlier volume . There are many reasons for believing that Doyle had as little to do with Watson 's manuscripts as Cervantes with Sancho Panza 's . Like Cervantes , Doyle had no interest in ? indeed , he had contempt for ? the stories he pretended were his own . But as soon as they became great popular successes , bringing him an income needed for other projects , he let them continue to appear under his own name , touching them up here and there , but editing them so hastily that many of Watson 's contradictions , like those of Sancho 's , were allowed to remain . The strongest internal evidence that neither Cervantes nor Doyle wrote the stories for which they became famous is simply the enormous contrast between the mentality and philosophical outlook of supposed author and hero . Don Quixote was a man of firm Roman Catholic faith and high moral principles , with a passion for chivalry . Cervantes hated chivalry . He allowed his name to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attacks on faith and chivalry . His infidelities to his wife , the episodes involving his mistresses , the affairs of his daughter ? all were so sordid that early biographers of Cervantes fell back on Latin when they supplied details . The equally great contrast between the minds of Holmes and Doyle has often been noted . Was Gilbert Chesterton the first to point out how much more Doyle had in common with Dr. Watson ? It is true that Doyle and Watson were both medical men , slow thinkers , good writers , and sensitive to the poetry of London ; yet there was one overwhelming difference between the two men that has not , I believe , been sufficiently recognized . I refer to Watson 's abiding respect for rationality , science , and common sense . // It has many times been pointed out that Holmes 's so-called deductions were actually inductions . Like the scientist trying to solve a mystery of nature , Holmes first gathered all the evidence he could that was relevant to his problem . At times he performed experiments to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of his vast knowledge of crime , and of sciences relevant to crime , to arrive at the most probable hypothesis . Deductions were made from the hypothesis ; then the theory was further tested against new evidence , revised if need be , until finally the truth emerged with a probability close to certainty . Although Watson seldom played a role in this complex process , with enormous respect he watched it unfold . Frequently mystified by the speed and efficiency of Holmes 's method , he never failed to admire it , to accept its final results , and on one occasion , after the procedure had been explained to him , to exclaim , " How absurdly simple ! " Nothing could be more remote from the mind-set of Watson 's alleged creator . Doyle spent the last twelve years of his life in a tireless crusade against science and rationality . It is a period usually glossed over quickly in biographies of Doyle , but , in view of today 's explosion of interest in spiritualism and all things occult , it is good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it provides overwhelming evidence that Doyle had almost nothing to do with either Holmes or Watson . It has been said that Doyle 's conversion to spiritualism , like the recent case of Bishop James Pike , was an emotional reaction to the death of his son . Not so . Even when he was a young Irish-Catholic , Doyle had a strong interest in psychic phenomena . His crusade for spiritualism began in 1916 , two years before his son died . Although several British scientists were caught up in the craze , notably Oliver Lodge and William Crookes , Doyle rapidly became the movement 's most infuential fugleman . He lectured and debated everywhere . His literary labors for the cause were prodigious . In addition to innumerable pamphlets , magazine articles , introductions to books by others , letters , and book reviews , the following volumes of spiritualist apologetics flowed from his pen : The New Revelation , The Vital Message , The Wanderings of a Spiritualist , Our American Adventure , Our Second American Adventure , The Case for Spirit Photography , Psychic Experiences , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edge of the Unknown , and , not least , a monumental two-volume History of Spiritualism . It is no good to say that Doyle had become senile . Clearly he had not . His final years were remarkably vigorous and productive . His last book , The Edge of the Unknown , published in 1930 , the year that he died at age seventy-one , is a model of lucid , beautifully structured prose . Thousands of people were deeply influenced by his books and lectures . Dr. Joseph B. Rhine . the eminent naransvchologist. is on record as saving that it was a // speech by Doyle that first inspired him to turn from botany , in which he had been trained , to the study of psychic phenomena . In Memories and Adventures ( pp. 392-94 ) , Doyle gives a dramatic summary of why he believes in spiritualism . He had seen his dead mother and nephew so plainly that he could have counted the wrinkles on one , the freckles on the other . He had conversed at length with spirit voices . He had smelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard were swiftly fulfilled . He had " seen the dead glimmer up upon a photographic plate " untouched by any hand but his own . His wife , a medium whose writing fingers would be seized by a spirit control , had produced " notebooks full of information . . . utterly beyond her ken . " He had seen heavy objects " swimming in the air , untouched by human hand . " He had seen " spirits walk around the room in fair light and join in the talk of the company . " On his wall was a painting done by a woman with no artistic training , but who had been possessed by an artistic spirit . He had read books written by unlettered mediums who transmitted the work of dead writers , and he had recognized the writer 's style , " which no parodist could have copied , and which was written in his own handwriting . " He had heard " singing beyond earthly power , and whistling done with no pause for the intake of breath . " He had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed doors and windows . " Why , Doyle concludes , should a man who has experienced all this " heed the chatter of irresponsible journalists , or the head-shaking of inexperienced men of science ? They are babies in this matter , and should be sitting at his feet . " Those are the strong words of a profoundly sincere man . They are also the words of a man with a temperament utterly alien to that of both Holmes and Watson . The bitter truth is that Doyle was an incompetent observer of supposed psychic events . He was ignorant of even the rudiments of magic and deception , hopelessly naive , capable of believing anything , no matter how flimsy the evidence . Over and over again the great mediums of the day who produced psychical phenomena were caught in fraud by the Holmeses and Watsons of science . Over and over again Doyle refused to recognize even the possibility of fraud except in a few cases where it was so patently obvious that everyone in the spiritualist movement recognized it . Even in such rare cases Doyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of genuine psychics . Were they not pressured into cheating by the incessant demands of skeptics for phenomena that could not always be produced at will ? In many cases Doyle flatly refused to believe fraudulent mediums even when they made full confessions and explained in detail exactly how they cheated . The most sensational of such confessions was by Margaret Fox , one of the Fox sisters of upper New York State whose ability to // produce spirit raps by cracking the first joint of a big toe had started the modern spiritualist craze . Margaret Fox 's remarkable confession , made in 1888 when she was eighty-one , appeared in the New York World , October 21 , and you can read it in Harry Houdini 's A Magician Among the Spirits . That night , on the stage of New York 's Academy of Music , under the close scrutiny of three physicians , Margaret took off a shoe , put one foot on a stool and demonstrated her toe-cracking technique to a hushed audience . How did Doyle react to her confession ? Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor did he believe Houdini when the magician tried to persuade him that prominent conjurors of the day who were capitalizing on the spiritualist movement by claiming supernormal powers were not genuine psychics . The Davenport brothers , for example , were friends of Houdini . He knew their methods well but was unable to convince Doyle that they were tricksters . Julius Zancig , another magician and friend of Houdini , had perfected a secret code by which he could transmit information quickly to his wife . Just as some magicians today pretend to be genuine mind readers because it enhances their reputation and increases their earnings , so the Zancigs found they could make more money posing as psychics than by doing straight magic . Doyle never doubted the authenticity of their telepathic abilities . Magicians found this as hilarious then as they do today whenever a famous writer or scientist goes on record as believing that some magician-turned-psychic has supernormal powers . Indeed , Doyle even refused to believe Houdini 's repeated denials that he , Houdini , was not psychic . Doyle 's essay , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most absurd documents in the history of parapsychology . Here is Doyle , the supposed creator of Sherlock Holmes , arguing soberly that his friend Houdini was in reality a medium who performed his escapes by dematerializing his body ! Houdini 's protests fell on uncomprehending ears . Doyle readily admitted that Houdini was a skilled conjuror , but he argued that the magician 's escapes were on such an " utterly different plane " from that of other magicians that it was an " outrage of common sense to think otherwise . " Why , if Houdini was a genuine psychic , did he deny his singular powers ? " Is it not perfectly evident , " Doyle answered himself , " that if he did not deny them his occupation would have been gone forever ? What would his brother-magicians have to say to a man who admitted that half his tricks were done by what they would regard as illicit powers ? It would have been exit Houdini . " ' 3 There is scarcely a page in any of Doyle 's books on the occult that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His gullibility was boundless . His comprehension of what constitutes scientific evidence was on a level with that of members of London 's flat-earth society . Consider , for example , the story he tells in The Coming of the Fairies . ' // In 1917 , in the Yorkshire village of Cottingley , a sixteen-year-old girl , Elsie Wright , was being visited by her ten-year-old cousin , Frances Griffiths . Elsie was a dreamy little girl who for years had loved to draw pictures of fairies . She had a fair amount of artistic talent , had done some designing for a jeweler , and once worked a few months for a photographer . The two girls loved to spend hours in a glen back of the cottage where , they told Mr. and Mrs. Wright , they often played with fairies . One day the girls borrowed Mr. Wright 's camera , and Elsie snapped a picture of Frances in the woods . When Mr. Wright developed the plate he was astonished to see four scantily clad Tinkerbells , with large butterfly wings , prancing merrily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a picture of Elsie that showed her beckoning a tiny gnome wearing black tights and pointed hat ( a bright red hat , the girls recalled ) to step into her lap . The two photos reached Doyle by way of Edward L. Gardner , a theosophist and occult journalist . Doyle wrote to Houdini in great excitement : " I have something . . . precious , two photos , one of a goblin , the other of four fairies in a Yorkshire wood . A fake ! you will say . No , sir , I think not . However , all inquiry will be made . These I am not allowed to send . The fairies are about eight inches high . In one there is a single goblin dancing . In the other , four beautiful , luminous creatures . Yes , it is a revelation . " In the December 1920 issue of the Strand Magazine , the monthly that had printed so many of Watson 's marvelous tales , Doyle and Gardner collaborated on " An Epoch-Making Event ? Fairies Photographed . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures as fakes , but hundreds of readers wrote to Doyle about the fairies that they , too , had seen in their gardens . Three years after the first two fairy pictures had been taken , Gardner brought the two cousins together again at the same cottage ( the girls insisted the fairies would not " come out " unless both were there ) and let them borrow his camera . Eventually the girls succeeded in obtaining three more fairy photos . Gardner was not present during any of this picture-taking . Why ? Because the girls convinced'him the fairies were extremely shy and would not come out for a stranger ! The three new pictures appeared in the Strand in 1921 , and the following year Doyle reproduced all five in his book The Coming of the Fairies . Of the three new photos , one shows a fairy with yellow wings ( the girls always supplied details about the colors ) offering a posy of " etheric harebells " to Elsie . A second shows an almost nude young lady , with lavender wings , leaping toward Elsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A winged fairy is on the left , another on the right . Both are either partly hidden behind twigs , or the twigs are showing through their transparent bodies . The girls recalled seeing the two creatures , but said they had noticed only a misty glow // between them . On the photograph this glow proved to be something that looks like nothing more than a piece of silk hanging on some branches . According to Doyle 's caption in the book 's first British edition , it is " a magnetic bath , woven very quickly by the fairies , and used after dull weather and in the autumn especially . The sun 's rays through the sheath appear to magnetize the interior and thus provide a bath ' that restores vitality and vigour . " Doyle was now firmly persuaded that the fairies were not " thought forms " projected into the camera by the girls , like the photographs which Jule Eisenbud argues , in his World of Ted Serios ( William Morrow , 1967 ) , were projected onto Polaroid film by a Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a population which may be as numerous as the human race . . . and which is only separated from ourselves by some difference of vibrations . " Moreover , Doyle was convinced that a revelation of the existence of these little people would go far toward combatting the materialism that dominated modern science , and so paved the way for an acceptance of the greater revelation of spiritualism . In 1920 he wrote to Gardner : I am proud to have been associated with you in this epoch-making incident . We have had continued messages at seances for some time that a visible sign was coming through ? and perhaps this was what is meant . The human race does not deserve fresh evidence . . . . However , our friends beyond are very long-suffering and more charitable than I , for I will confess that my soul is filled with a cold contempt for the muddleheaded indifference and the moral cowardice which I see around me . Doyle noticed that one of the four fairies , in the first picture taken by the girls , is playing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnome in the second picture . Is not this the traditional pipe of Pan ? According to the girls , it made a " tiny little tinkle " that could barely be heard when all was still . And if the fairies have pipes , why not other belongings ? " Does it not suggest a complete range of utensils and instruments . . . ? " Doyle asks . " It seems to me that with fuller knowledge and with fresh means of vision , these people are destined to become just as solid and real as the Eskimos . " One of the funniest ( and saddest ) aspects of Doyle 's preposterous book is that the five pictures he so proudly displays are not even clever fakes . The lack of modeling on the fairy figures , and their sharp outlines , indicate that Elsie had simply drawn them on stiff paper , then the girls had cut them out and stuck them in the grass or supported them in the air with invisible wires or threads . ( The pictures could have been faked in other ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ladies have hairdos that were fashionable at the time . There is not the slightest blurring of their fluttering wings . In every picture the fairies look as flat as paper dolls . // Unlike Dr. Watson , Doyle could never bring himself to exclaim , " How absurdly simple ! " Not once did he doubt the genuineness of the fairy photos , although he did own that proof of their authenticity was less " overwhelming " than for the authenticity of photographs of discar-nates on the " other side . " The two girls never obtained another fairy picture . Doyle reports on a visit in 1921 to the Cottingley glen by a clairvoyant named Geoffrey Hodson . He was accompanied by the two girls . The place swarmed with elves , gnomes , fairies , brownies , goblins , water nymphs , and other elusive creatures , all seen and vividly described by Hodson and the girls , but the little people refused to appear on any camera plates. , In 1971 both Elsie and Frances were interviewed by the BBC . The two elderly ladies insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsie was asked point blank if she or Frances had faked them , she was unwilling to deny it . " I 've told you they 're photographs of figments of our imagination , " she said , " and that 's what I 'm sticking to . " The same question was put to Frances , who was interviewed separately . Frances asked how Elsie had answered it . When told , she said she had nothing to add.6 Well , what is one to make of an eminent writer who believed that Houdini dematerialized his body to perform his escapes and that the glens of England teem with wee folk who now and then allow themselves to be seen and photographed by us mortals ? However you answer , one thing is certain . Such a man could never have constructed , as figments of his imagination , the coldly rational Holmes or his admiring Dr. Watson . It was not , I think , Doyle who made this pair immortal . It was the other way around . Holmes and Watson , intent on guarding their pri-vacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In doing so , they conferred upon him that earthly immortality that his authentic but undistinguished writings could never have provided . Postscript Jerome Clark , in his flatulent Fate articles ( cited above in Note 5 ) , defended the genuineness of the fairy photos . In a later piece ( " The Cot-tingley Fairies : The Last Word , " Fate , November 1978 ) Clark ate crow . The reason : a discovery reported in Ghosts in Photographs ( Harmony Books , 1978 ) , by occult journalist Fred Gittings . Gittings found a children 's book , Princess Mary 's Gift Book , pub-lished in England in 1915 by Hodder and Stoughton , the same house ( ironically ) that later published Doyle 's treatise on the fairies . In the gift book is a poem by Alfred Noyes called " A Spell for a Fairy " that tells how to conjure up the wee creatures . The poem 's final illustration shows three dancing fairies . When you compare them with the three in the first Cottingley photograph , you see at once they are line-for-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cardboard , added wings , then cut them out , and the girls had stuck them in the grass just as the skeptics had always said . // This revelation convinced Clark that the photos were indeed a hoax . Will it convince Jule Eisenbud ? I doubt it . Many thought-photographs of Ted Serios were found to correspond line for line with published photographs . This did not disturb Eisenbud in the least . He still firmly believes that Ted saw those pictures in magazines , imprinted them on his mind , then years later projected them by his psychic powers onto Polaroid film . One can similarly argue that the two girls saw the fairy pictures in the gift book , remembered them , and later psychically projected three of the prancing ladies onto the camera plates . Paranormal hypotheses never die . They just momentarily fade , only to bloom again in full strength . Robert Sheaffer 's article , " The Cottingley Fairies : A Hoax ? " ( Fate , June 1978 ) was written before Gittings 's discovery , but it presents additional strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful hoax of his own . His " Cottingley Photographs : Winged Astronauts ? " suggested that the fairies could have been creatures from UFOs . It was printed in Official UFO Magazine , October 1977 , by editors too stupid to realize that Sheaffer had his tongue in his cheek . Frances and Elsie were interviewed again , their remarks appearing in the October 25 , 1975 , issue of the British magazine Woman . The ladies stuck by their psychic guns . For reproductions of the picture copied by the girls , see Gittings 's book , Clark 's apologetic article , James Randi 's recent Flim-Flam ! ( Lippincott &; Crowell , 1980 ) . 10 Great Fakes of Science Politicians , real-estate agents , used-car salesmen , and advertising copywriters are expected to stretch facts in self-serving directions , but scientists who falsify their results are regarded by their peers as committing an inexcusable crime . Yet the sad fact is that the history of science swarms with cases of outright fakery and instances of scientists who unconsciously distorted their work by seeing it through lenses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with garden peas first revealed the basic laws of heredity , was such a hero of modern science that scientists in the thirties were shocked to learn that this pious monk probably doctored his data . R. A. Fisher , a famous British statistician , checked Mendel 's reports carefully . The odds , he concluded , are about 10,000 to 1 that Mendel gave an inaccurate account of his experiments. , Brother Mendel was a Roman Catholic priest who lived in an abbey in Brunn , now part of Czechoslovakia . More than a century ago , working alone in a monastery garden , he found that his plants were breeding according to precise laws of probability . Later , these laws were explained by the theory of genes ( now known to be sections along a helical DNA molecule ) , but it was Brother Mendel who laid the foundations for what later was called Mendelian genetics . His great work was totally ignored by the botanists of hiF time , and he died without knowing he would become famous . Most of the monk 's work was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into dwarfs , but tall pea plants are of two kinds . Seeds from one kind produce only tails . Seeds from the other kind produce both tails and dwarfs . Mendel found that when he crossed true-breeding // tails with dwarfs he got only tails . When he self-pollinated these tall hybrids he got a mixture of ? true-breeding tails , ? dwarfs , and ? tails that did not breed true . Today one says that tallness in garden peas is dominant , dwarfness is recessive . Mendel 's breeding experiment is like shaking an even mixture of red and blue beads in a hat , then taking out a pair . The probability is ? you will get red-red , ? you will get blue-blue , and ' /2 you will get redblue . These , however , are " long-run " probabilities . Make such a test just once , with ( say ) 200 evenly mixed beads , and the odds are strongly against your getting exactly 25 red pairs , 25 blue , and 50 mixed . Statisticians would be deeply suspicious if you reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this reason . They are too good to be true . Did the priest consciously fudge his data ? Let us be charitable . Perhaps he was guilty only of " wishful seeing " when he classified and counted his talls and dwarfs . Geologists find strange things in the ground , but none so strange as the " fossils " unearthed by Johann Beringer , a learned professor of science at the University of Wiirzburg . German Protestants of the early eighteenth century , like so many American fundamentalists today , could not believe that fossils were the relics of life that flourished millions of years ago . Professor Beringer had an unusual theory . Some fossils , he admitted , might be the remains of life that perished in the great flood of Noah , but most of them were " peculiar stones " carved by God himself as he experimented with the kinds of life he intended to create . Beringer was ecstatic when his teen-age helpers began to dig up hundreds of stones that supported his hypothesis . They bore images of the bodies of strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One bird had a fish 's head ? an idea God had apparently discarded . Other stones showed the sun , moon , five-pointed stars , and comets with blazing tails . He began to find stones with Hebrew letters . One had " Jehovah " carved on it . In 1726 Beringer published a huge treatise on these marvelous discoveries . It was written in Latin and impressively illustrated with engraved plates . Colleagues tried to convince Beringer he was being bamboozled , but he dismissed this as " vicious raillery " by stubborn , establishment enemies . No one knows what finally changed the professor 's mind . It was said that he found a stone with his own name on it ! An inquiry was held . One of his assistants confessed . It turned out that the peculiar stones had been carved by two peculiar colleagues , one the university 's librarian , the other a professor of geography . Poor trusting , stupid Beringer , his career shattered , spent his life 's savings buying up copies of his idiotic book and burning them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. , . - , . fomnnc mnmiment to aeoloaical aullery that twentv-seven // years after Beringer 's death a new edition was published in Germany . In 1963 a handsome translation was issued by the University of California Press . Beringer has become immortal only as the victim of a cruel hoax.2 Was Paul Kammerer the victim of a similar hoax , or was he himself the perpetrator ? In any case , when someone applied India ink to ( or perhaps injected it into ) the feet of several of Kammerer 's frogs , the career of one of the most respected of Viennese biologists was brought to an inglorious end . Kammerer was the last great champion of a theory of evolution called Lamarckism . In this view , named for the French naturalist Jean Lamarck , acquired traits are somehow passed on to descendants : when giraffes stretched their necks to nibble high leaves , their offspring were born with longer necks . Darwin himself was a Lamarckian . Modern genetics discards this theory , replacing it with the Mendelian view that natural selection operates on variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " establishment " view , but the new Mendelian theory was rapidly gaining ground . Eager to defend the older theory ( he had written a book about it called The Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics ) , Kammerer devised a simple experiment with a species of frog known as the " midwife toad . " Most toads mate in water . To keep a firm grip on the female 's slippery body , the male toad develops dark " nuptial pads " on his feet . The male midwife toad , which mates on land , lacks such pads . Kammerer 's scheme was to force midwife toads to copulate under water for several generations , then see if they develop nuptial pads . It was a stupid experiment , because , had it succeeded , Mendelians would have explained it as no more than a revival of a genetic blueprint . Nothing so complicated as a nuptial pad could have developed in just a few generations . But Kammerer went ahead with his plan and soon reported it to be a huge success . The black pads had indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Lamarckism then completely dominated biology . Russian scientists were so impressed that they offered Kammerer a post at the University of Moscow . No sooner had Kammerer accepted this offer than it was discovered that his toad specimens had been crudely faked . It was the biggest science scandal of the decade . Kammerer blamed it all on an assistant , but nobody believed him . In 1926 , at age 46 , he took a pistol and shot himself through the head . Kammerer continued to be a great hero in the Soviet Union throughout the period when Joseph Stalin and the plant-breeder Trofim Lysenko , both enthusiastic Lamarckians , saw to it that Mendelian geneticists were banished to Siberia . Now that Lysenko is dead and Soviet genetics has gone Mendelian , it is hard to find a biologist anywhere in the world who takes Lamarckism seriously . // Arthur Koestler 's The Case of the Midwife Toad ( Random House , 1971 ) argues that Kammerer was probably innocent of fraud and that Lamarckism is still a viable theory . Of course Koestler could be right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports on recent developments that have Lamarckian overtones , see " Lamarck Lives ? In the Immune System , " by Colin Tudge , in New Scientist ( February 19 , 1981 ) , and " Fighting Lamarck 's Shadow , " by Susan West , in Science News ( March 14 , 1981 ) . Are live eggs psychic ? Can a fertilized egg use its powers of PK ( psychokinesis ) to influence electronic machines ? Leading parapsychologists around the world thought so until the great 1974 scandal , at Dr. J. B. Rhine 's famed Institute of Parapsychology , in Durham , North Carolina , threw these eggstraordinary results into the ash can . When Time did a cover story called " The Psychics " in 1974 , the most persuasive letter to the science editor , Leon Jaroff , protesting Time 's " unfair " charges of fraud in ESP research , was from Dr. Walter J. Levy , Jr . Levy was then the 26-year-old director of Rhine 's institute . Three months later Levy resigned in disgrace . Rhine had been extremely proud of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using computers to record and evaluate data . Levy 's most impressive experiment involved fertilized chicken eggs beneath an incubator that was turned off and on at chance intervals by a randomizing device . Laws of probability dictated that the heat would be on half the time , but computer records showed it to be on more often than off . Clearly the eggs had influenced the randomizer by PK . When Levy used hard-boiled eggs , no PK . His findings appeared in Rhine 's journal in an abstract titled " Possible PK by Chicken Embryos to Obtain Warmth " ( Journal of Parapsychology , vol. 34 , 1970 , p. 303 ) . Dr. Levy 's undoing was a later PK test he made with rats . Electrodes had been implanted in the rodents ' brains so that when a randomizer turned on the current the rats got intense pleasure shocks . Levy found that the rats used their PK powers to get their kicks 55 percent of the time . This bolstered his earlier animal-psi results on the PK abilities of gerbils and hamsters to avoid unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell a rat . One of them , peeping from a concealed spot , saw Levy repeatedly pull a plug from a recorder that caused it to register only hits . A secret set of instruments , installed without Levy 's knowledge , recorded the expected dull score of 50 percent . Confronted by this evidence Levy admitted everything . He blamed his downfall on overwork and the pressure to get results . The young parapsychologist has n't been heard from since he got caught , as one : . ... : . ... : . - . -. : r : ... . e 1 ...

We ca n't smell it , but the bug can . In 1976 a chemist at Pennsylvania State University reported that the sex odors of certain insects depend on what they eat . The university trumpeted this amazing result , which threatened to revolutionize pest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experiment and got negative results . This happens over and over again at top universities and research centers . A scientist , overeager for recognition and greedy for research grants , rushes into print with a staggering claim . Colleagues try to replicate the experiment . They fail . The great claim fades into oblivion . The most notorious of recent instances , in 1973 , quickly grew into a medical Watergate . William T. Summerlin , chief of transplant immunology at the world-renowned Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in New York City , announced a stupendous breakthrough . He had , he claimed , grafted a patch of skin from a black mouse to the back of a white mouse , and the white mouse had not rejected it . The skin had been carefully prepared by special techniques . If true , medical benefits would be enormous ? not only for grafts and transplants , but also for cancer control . Summerlin had the backing of his boss , Robert Good , president of Sloan-Kettering and co-author of many of Summerlin 's papers . The great discovery hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches were as phony as Kammerer 's nuptial pads . Summerlin had painted them on the white mice to convince his colleagues of what he firmly believed to be true . It was a black and white case . The patches easily washed off with alcohol . Good could hardly believe it . " I trusted him , " he said . " He came as a respected scientist . " Summerlin was given a leave of absence for psychiatric treatment . He never went back . Today he is practicing medicine in a small Louisiana town . Even if his grafting methods should later prove to be sound , his career as a research scientist is finished.4 It is easy to understand how scientists can fake or fudge results , but surely this sort of thing is impossible in pure mathematics . Wrong ! A celebrated case involves an Italian mathematician known only as Lazzarini . He is famous for having reported in 1901 an experimental calculation of the decimals in pi , the most ubiquitous of all irrational numbers . The curious method he used had earlier been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to mathematicians as " Buffon 's needle . " Rule a series of parallel lines on a sheet of paper , all neighboring lines separated by the same distance k . Obtain a needle longer than k . Call its length n . If you drop the needle on the grid , so it falls in a random position , the probability it will cross a line is 2n/ak . If // the width between lines and the needle 's length are the same , the probability reduces to a simple 2/a . Keep dropping the needle , maintaining a record of hits and misses , and you can use the formula for calculating pi . The more often you toss the needle , the closer you get to pi 's correct value . Lazzarini tossed his needle 3,408 times . From this he obtained a value of pi equal to 3.1415929 , which is correct through the first six decimal places ( the seventh decimal should be 6 not 9 ) . As in Mendel 's data , Lazzarini 's result is much too good to be true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few as 3,408 tosses are millions to one . There is no doubt that Lazzarini fudged his results , but no one thought to question them until 1960.5 Postscript My article on science fakes was written at Esquire 's request . I give it here essentially as I wrote it , not as it was compressed by the editors to make what became short captions for large color illustrations for their October 1977 issue . The last two items were not used by the magazine . Of course there are many other great fakes I could have included . Here are a few : ? The Piltdown Man . This skull , supposedly discovered in a gravel pit near London in 1911 by Charles Dawson , an antiquarian , was for decades thought to be the most ancient of all fossil remnants of man . In 1953 scientists at the British Museum made chemical tests proving it to be a clever forgery ? the skull of a fossil man combined with the jaw of a mntarn nn .. Th. ; nw hnri hrrn rnlnrt ? d tn make it look old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The museum later found that five other antiquities acquired from Dawson and his widow were also forgeries . Moreover , much of Dawson 's two-volume history of Hastings turned out to have been copied from an unpublished manuscript in the Hastings Museum . ? Sir Cyril Burt . This distinguished psychologist was editor of the British Journal of Statistical Psychology and an ardent promoter of parapsychology . He was best known for his studies of identical twins who had grown up apart . The studies showed that heredity played almost the entire role in determining a person 's intelligence . Burt was England 's first psychologist to be knighted . In 1976 investigations proved that Burt had shamelessly forged his data . He even invented two mythical women who had supposedly assisted in his research ! Most of his test scores were made up . You can read all about it in Cyril Burt , Psychologist , by L. S. Hearnshaw ( Cornell University Press , 1979 ) . ? Dr. Samuel G. Soal . When he died in 1975 Soal was considered England 's top parapsychologist . Rhine called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the philosopher C. D. Broad , Soal 's work was " outstanding . " " The precautions taken to prevent deliberate fraud were absolutely watertight , " said Broad . Many parapsychologists , and scientists who , like Cyril Burt , accepted the results of parapsychology , considered Soal 's work the most reputable and the most convincing in the annals of psi research . Rumors and charges that Soal had falsified data in one of his most famous experiments began to mount shortly before his death . The rumors were intensified when Soal revealed that the original score sheets for the questionable experiment had been lost . Leading parapsychologists defended Soal vehemently until statistician Betty Markwick proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that Soal had deliberately cheated ( see Chapter 19 ) . ? The latest scandal involving data fudging was reported in the New York Times , June 28 , 1980 . Dr. John Long , of the pathology department at the Harvard University School of Medicine , had been doing research on antibodies under a $150,000 grant . He resigned after admitting falsifying his results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " orthodox " science ? I do n't know . The pressures to produce are probably greater in certain areas of traditional science than in parapsychology for the simple reason that funding is larger and there is more competition for the loot . On the other hand , the temptation to falsify data may be less in orthodox areas because scientists accept replication failures as evidence against a hypothesis , thus making it easy to discredit falsified research . Parapsychology is almost alone in its remarkable ability to discount a replication failure as being due to some factor , such as a scientist 's skepticism , that inhibited the operation of paranormal powers . Also , if a scientist holds a highly eccentric belief , his compulsion to // convince orthodox colleagues , who may regard him with contempt , may provide unusually strong motives for both conscious fudging and selfdeception . My overall impression is that cheating and self-deception are greater in parapsychology than in most sciences , especially the physical sciences , but not by much . 11 Fliess , Freud , and Biorhythm At Aussee I know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall reveal to me the secrets of the world of the lower ani-mals and the world of children . I am agape as never before for what you have to say ? and I hope that the world will not hear it before me , and that instead of a short article you will give us within a year a small book which will reveal organic secrets in periods of 28 and 23 . Sigmund Freud , in a letter to Wilhelm Fliess , 1897 One of the most extraordinary and absurd episodes in the history of numerological pseudoscience concerns the work of a Berlin surgeon named Wilhelm Fliess . Fliess was obsessed by the numbers 23 and 28 . He convinced himself and others that behind all living phenomena and per-haps inorganic nature as well there are two fundamental cycles : a male cycle of 23 days and a female cycle of 28 days . By working with multiples of those two numbers ? sometimes adding , sometimes subtracting ? he was able to impose his number patterns on virtually everything . The work made a considerable stir in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up the system , elaborating and modifying it in books , pamphlets , and articles . In recent years the movement has taken root in the United States . Although Fliess 's numerology is of interest to recreational mathe-maticians and students of pathological science , it would probably be // unremembered today were it not for one almost unbelievable fact : For a decade Fliess was Sigmund Freud 's best friend and confidant . Roughly from 1890 to 1900 , in the period of Freud 's greatest creativity , which culminated with the publication of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900 , he and Fliess were linked in a strange neurotic relationship that had ? as Freud himself was well aware ? strong homosexual undercurrents . The story was known , of course , to the early leaders of psychoanalysis , but few laymen had even heard of it until the publication in 1950 of a selection of 168 letters from Freud to Fliess , out of a total of 284 that Fliess had carefully preserved . ( The letters were first published in German . An English translation entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 . ) Freud was staggered by the news that these letters had been preserved , and he begged the owner ( the analyst Marie Bonaparte ) not to permit their publication . In reply to her question about Fliess 's side of the correspondence Freud said : " Whether I destroyed them Fliess 's letters or cleverly hid them away I still do not know . " It is assumed that he destroyed them . The full story of the FliessFreud friendship has been told by Ernest Jones in his biography of Freud . When the two men first met in Vienna in 1877 , Freud was thirty-one , relatively unknown , happily married , and with a modest practice in psychiatry . Fliess had a much more successful practice as a nose and throat surgeon in Berlin . He was two years younger than Freud , a bachelor ( later he married a wealthy Viennese woman ) , handsome , vain , brilliant , witty , and well informed on medical and scientific topics . Freud opened their correspondence with a flattering letter . Fliess responded with a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had requested . By 1892 they had dropped the formal Sie ( you ) for the intimate du ( thou ) . Freud wrote more often than Fliess and was in torment when Fliess was slow in answering . When his wife was expecting their fifth child , Freud declared it would be named Wilhelm . Indeed , he would have named either of his two youngest children Wilhelm but , as Jones put it , " fortunately they were both girls . " The foundations of Fliess 's numerology were first revealed to the world in 1897 when he published his monograph Die Beziehungen zwischen Nase and Weibliche Geschlechtsorganen in ihrer biologischen Bedeutungen dargestellt ( The Relations between the Nose and the Female Sex Organs from the Biological Aspects ) . Every person , Fliess maintained , is really bisexual . The male component is keyed to the rhythmic cycle of 23 days , the female to a cycle of 28 days . ( The female cycle must not be confused with the menstrual cycle , although the two are related in evolutionary origin . ) In normal males the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In normal females it is the other way around . The two cycles are present in every living cell and consequently play their dialectic roles in all living things . Among animals and humans both // cycles start at birth , the sex of the child being determined by the cycle that is transmitted first . The periods continue throughout life , manifesting themselves in the ups and downs of one 's physical and mental vitality , and eventually determine the day of one 's death . Moreover , both cycles are intimately connected with the mucous lining of the nose . Fliess thought he had found a relation between nasal irritations and all kinds of neurotic symptoms and sexual irregularities . He diagnosed these ills by inspecting the nose and treated them by applying cocaine to " genital spots " on the nose 's interior . He reported cases in which miscarriages were produced by anesthetizing the nose , and he said that he could control painful menstruation by treating the nose . On two occasions he operated on Freud 's nose . In a later book he argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite sex , and when Freud expressed doubts , he accused Freud of being left-handed without knowing it . Fliess 's theory of cycles was at first regarded by Freud as a major breakthrough in biology . He sent Fliess information on 23- and 28-day periods in his own life and the lives of those in his family , and he viewed the ups and downs of his health as fluctuations of the two periods . He believed a distinction he had found between neurasthenia and anxiety neurosis could be explained by the two cycles . In 1898 he severed editorial connections with a journal because it refused to retract a harsh review of one of Fliess 's books . There was a time when Freud suspected that sexual pleasure was a release of 23-cycle energy and sexual unpleasure a release of 28-cycle energy . For years he expected to die at the age of 51 because it was the sum of 23 and 28 , and Fliess had told him this would be his most critical year . " Fifty-one is the age which seems to be a particularly dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dreams . " I have known colleagues who have died suddenly at that age , and amongst them one who , after long delays , had been appointed to a professorship only a few days before his death . " Freud 's acceptance of Fliess 's cycle theory was not , however , enthusiastic enough for Fliess . Abnormally sensitive to even the lightest criticism , he thought he detected in one of Freud 's 1896 letters some faint suspicions about his system . This marked the beginning of the slow emergence of latent hostility on both sides . Freud 's earlier attitude toward Fliess had been one of almost adolescent dependence on a mentor and father figure . Now he was developing theories of his own about the origins of neuroses and methods of treating them . Fliess would have little of this . He argued that Freud 's imagined cures were no more than the fluctuations of mental illness , in obedience to the male and female rhythms . The two men were on an obvious collision course . As one could have predicted from the earlier letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The growing rift plunged Freud into a severe // neurosis , from which he emerged only after painful years of self-analysis . The two men had been in the habit of meeting frequently in Vienna , Berlin , Rome , and elsewhere , for what Freud playfully called their " congresses . " As late as 1900 , when the rift was beyond repair , we find Freud writing : " There has never been a six months ' period where I have longed more to be united with you and your family . . . . Your sug-gestion of a meeting at Easter greatly stirred me . . . . It is not merely my almost childlike yearning for the spring and for more beautiful scenery ; that I would willingly sacrifice for the satisfaction of having you near me for three days . . . . We should talk reasonably and scientifically , and your beautiful and sure biological discoveries would awaken my deepest ? though impersonal ? envy . " Freud nevertheless turned down the invitation , and the two men did not meet until later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that Freud had made a violent and unprovoked verbal attack on him . For the next two years Freud tried to heal the breach . He proposed that they collaborate on a book on bisexuality . He suggested that they meet again in 1902 . Fliess turned down both suggestions . In 1904 Fliess published angry accusations that Freud had leaked some of his ideas to Hermann Swoboda , one of Freud 's young patients , who in turn had pub-lished them as his own . The final quarrel seems to have taken place in a dining room of the Park Hotel in Munich . On two later occasions , when Freud was in this room in connection with meetings of the analytical movement , he experi-enced a severe attack of anxiety . Jones recalls an occasion in 1912 , when he and a group that included Freud and Jung were lunching in this same room . A break between Freud and Jung was brewing . When the two men got into a mild argument , Freud suddenly fainted . Jung carried him to a sofa . " How sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was coming to . Later he confided to Jones the reason for his attack . Fliess wrote many books and articles about his cycle theory , but his magnum opus was a 584-page volume , DerAblauf des Lebens : Grundle-gung zur Exakten Biologie ( The Rhythm of Life : Foundations of an Exact Biology ) , published in Leipzig in 1906 ( second edition , Vienna , 1923 ) . The book is a masterpiece of Teutonic crackpottery . Fliess 's basic formula can be written 23x+ 28y , where x and y are positive or negative integers . On almc.t every page Fliess fits this formula to natural phe-nomena , ranging from the cell to the solar system . The moon , for example , goes around the earth in about 28 days ; a complete sun-spot cycle is almost 23 years . The book 's appendix is filled with such tables as multiples of 365 ( days in the year ) , multiples of 23 , multiples of 28 , multiples of 232 , multiples of 282 , multiples of 644 ( which is 23 x 28 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 x 232 , 21,952 28 x 282 , 43,904 2 x 28 x 282 , and so on . A table lists the numbers 1 through 28 , each expressed as a difference between multiples of 28 and 23 for example , 13 = ( 21 x 28 ) ? ( 25 x 23 ) . Another table expresses numbers 1 through 51 23 + 28 as sums and differences of multiples of 23 and 28 for example , 1 = ( ? x 28 ) + ( 2 x 28 ) ? ( 3 x 23 ) . Freud admitted on many occasions that he was hopelessly deficient in all mathematical abilities . Fliess understood elementary arithmetic , but little more . He did not realize that if any two positive integers that have no common divisor are substituted for 23 and 28 in his basic formula , it is possible to express any positive integer whatever . Little wonder that the formula could be so readily fitted to natural phenomena ! This is easily seen by working with 23 and 28 as an example . First determine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of 1 . They are x = 11 , Figure It is now a simple matter to produce any desired positive integer by the following method : Figure As Roland Sprague recently pointed out in problem 26 of his Recreation in Mathematics , 1963 , even if negative values of x and y are excluded , it is still possible to express all positive integers greater than a certain integer . In the finite set of positive integers that can not be expressed by this formula , asks Sprague , what is the largest number ? In other words , what is the largest number that can not be expressed by substituting nonnegative integers for x and y in the formula 23x+ 28y ? The answer : xy-x-y . Freud eventually realized that Fliess 's superficially surprising results were no more than numerological juggling . After Fliess 's death in 1928 ( note the obliging 28 ) , a German physician , J. Aelby , published a book that constituted a thorough refutation of Fliess 's absurdities . By then , however , the 23-28 cult was firmly established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cult 's second most important figure . As a psychologist at the University of Vienna he devoted much time to investigating , defending , and writing about Fliess 's cycle theory . In his own rival masterwork , the 576-page Das Siebenjahr ( The Year of Seven ) , he reported on his studies of hundreds of family trees to prove that such events as heart attacks . deaths . and the onset of major ills tend to fall nn // certain critical days that can be computed on the basis of one 's male and female cycles . He applied the cycle theory to dream analysis , an application that Freud criticizes in a 1911 footnote to his book on dreams . Swoboda also designed the first slide rule for determining critical days . Without the aid of such a device or the assistance of elaborate charts , calculations of critical days are tedious and tricky . Incredible though it may seem , as late as the 1960s the Fliess system still had a small but devoted band of disciples in Germany and Switzerland . There were doctors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of Fliess 's cycles . ( This practice goes back to Fliess . In 1925 , when Karl Abraham , one of the pioneers of analysis , had a gallbladder operation , he insisted that it take place on the favorable day calculated by Fliess . ) To the male and female cycles modern Fliessians have added a third cycle , called the intellectual cycle , which has a length of 33 days . Two books on the Swiss system have been published here by Crown : Biorhythm , 1961 , by Hans J. Wernli , and Is This Your Day ? , 1964 , by George Thommen . Thommen is the president of a firm that supplies calculators and charting kits with which to plot one 's own cycles . The three cycles start at birth and continue with absolute regularity throughout life , although their amplitudes decrease with old age . The male cycle governs such masculine traits as physical strength , confidence , aggressiveness , and endurance . The female cycle controls such feminine traits as feelings , intuition , creativity , love , cooperation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common to both sexes : intelligence , memory , concentration , quickness of mind . On days when a cycle is above the horizontal zero line of the chart , the energy controlled by that cycle is being discharged . These are the days of highest vitality and efficiency . On days when the cycle is below the line , energy is being recharged . These are the days of reduced vitality . When your male cycle is high and your other cycles are low , you can perform physical tasks admirably but are low in sensitivity and mental alertness . If your female cycle is high and your male cycle low , it is a fine day , say , to visit an art museum but a day on which you are likely to tire quickly . The reader can easily guess the applications of other cycle patterns to other common events of life . I omit details about methods of predicting the sex of unborn children or computing the rhythmic " compatibility " between two individuals . The most dangerous days are those on which a cycle , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those days when a cycle is making a transition from one phase to another are called " switch-point days . " It is a pleasant fact that switch points for the 28-cycle always occur on the same day of the week for any given individual , since this cycle is  --   --  ? ? r- fie I. , no if vrn , r twitch noint for the 28-cycle is on // Tuesday , for instance , every other Tuesday will be your critical day for female energy throughout your entire life . As one might expect , if the switch points of two cycles coincide , the day is " doubly critical , " and it is " triply critical " if all three coincide . The Thommen and Wernli books contain many rhythmograms showing that the days on which various famous people died were days on which two or more cycles were at switch points . On two days on which Clark Gable had heart attacks , the second fatal , two cycles were at switch points . The Aga Khan died on a triply critical day . Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in July , 1962 , and lost the Professional Golf Association Tourney during a triple low two weeks later . The boxer Benny ( Kid ) Paret died after a knockout in a match on a triply critical day . Clearly it behooves the Fliessian to prepare a chart of his future cycle patterns so that he can exercise especial care on critical days ; since other factors come into play , however , no ironclad predictions can be made . Because each cycle has an integral length in days , it follows that every person 's rhythmogram will repeat its pattern after an interval of 23 x 28 x 33 = 21,252 days , or a little more than 58 years . This interval will be the same for everybody . For example , 21,252 days after every person 's birth all three of his cycles will cross the zero line simultaneously on their upswing and his entire pattern will start over again . Two people whose ages are exactly 21,252 days apart will be running on perfectly synchronized cycle patterns . Since Fliess 's system did not include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapse of 23 x 28 = 644 days . Swiss Fliessians call this the " biorhythmic year . " It is important in computing the " biorhythmic compatibility " between two individuals , since any two persons born 644 days apart are synchronized with respect to their two most important cycles . Postscript George S. Thommen , president of Biorhythm Computers , Inc. , 298 Fifth Avenue , New York , is still going strong , appearing occasionally on radio and television talk-shows to promote his products . James Randi , the magician , was moderator of an all-night radio talk-show in the midsixties . Thommen was twice his guest . After one of the shows , Randi tells me , a lady in New Jersey sent him her birth date and asked for a biorhythm chart covering the next two years of her life . After sending her an actual chart , but based on a different birth date , Randi received an effusive letter from the lady saying that the chart exactly matched all her critical up and down days . Randi wrote back , apologized for having made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " correct " chart , actually as wrongly dated as the first one . He soon received a letter telling him that the new chart was even more accurate than the first one . Speaking in March , 1966 , at the 36th annual convention of the Greater New York Safety Council , Thommen reported that biorhythm research projects were under way at the University of Nebraska and the University of Minnesota , and that Dr. Tatai , medical chief of Tokyo 's public health department , had published a book , Biorhythm and Human Life , using the Thommen system . When a Boeing 727 jetliner crashed in Tokyo in February , 1966 , Dr. Tatai quickly drew up the pilot 's chart , Thommen said , and found that the crash occurred on one of the pilot 's low days . Biorhythm seems to have been more favorably received in Japan than in the United States . According to Time , January 10 , 1972 , page 48 , the Ohmi Railway Co. , in Japan , computed the biorhythms of each of its 500 bus drivers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , he was given a notice to be extra careful . The Ohmi company reported a fifty percent drop in accidents . Fate magazine , February , 1975 , pages 109-110 , reported on a conference on " Biorhythm , Healing and Kirlian Photography , " held in Evanston , Ill. , October , 1974 . Michael Zaeske , who sponsored the conference , revealed that the traditional biorhythm curves are actually " first derivatives " of the true curves , and that all the traditional charts are " in error by several days . " Guests at the meeting also heard evidence from California that a fourth cycle exists , and that all four cycles " may be related to Jung 's four personality types . " Science News , January 18 , 1975 , page 45 , carried a large ad by Edmund Scientific Company for their newly introduced Biorhythm Kit ( $11.50 ) , containing the precision-made Dialgraf Calculator . The ad also offered an " accurate computerized , personalized " biorhythm chart report for 12 months to any reader who sent his birthdate and $15.95 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly off three days ) or Zaeske 's refined procedures . A ridiculous book , Biorhythm : A Personal Science , by Bernard Gittelson , was published in 1975 by Arco , and later by Werner books as a paperback . Pocket Books jumped into the action with Arbie Dale 's Biorhythm ( 1976 ) . Reader 's Digest ( September 1977 ) gave the " science " a major boost with Jennifer Bolch 's shameless article , " Biorhythm : A Key to Your Ups and Downs . " By 1980 biorhythm had become so popular among the gullible that half a dozen firms were manufacturing mechanical devices , electronic computers , and even clocks that told true believers what to expect each day . See Fate for advertisements . Science 80 , in its January/February 1980 issue , ran an article by Russell Schoch called " The Myth of Sigmund ++ which included a pond nhotoaranh of Freud and Fliess together // For an excellent debunking article see William Sims Bainbridge , " Biorhythm : Evaluating a Pseudoscience , " in the Skeptical Inquirer , Spring/Summer 1979 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of biorhythm 's preposterous claims appeared in the Zetetic Scholar , vol. 1 , no. 1 , 1978 . See also Chapter 8 , " The Great Fliess Fleece , " in James Randi 's Flim-Flam ! ( Lippincott &; Crowell , 1980 ) . 12 A Skeptic 's View of Parapsychology D. Scott Rogo , struggling to depict parapsychology as a science rapidl gaining respectability , has adopted a familiar tactic . He says nothing a all about the wild , preposterous claims now being made by leading work ers in the field . Instead , he describes a few conservative experiments con ducted by Charles Honorton and Helmut Schmidt . " I hope I have mad it clear , " he concludes , " that parapsychologists do not spend the time . . . gawking at Uri Geller . " There is no way a skeptic can comment meaningfully on the Honor ton and Schmidt experiments , because there is no way , now that the test are completed , to know exactly what controls were actually in force . A accurate evaluation , by a skeptical psychologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw data still available , interviewing a the participants , and so on . No top psychologist has time for such a tas unless he is substantially funded ; even then , he might not consider worthwhile . In the few cases where this has been done ? C. E. M Hansel 's investigation of the classic Pearce-Pratt tests , for instance ? large loopholes in controls have come to light . Instead of acknowledgin the loopholes , parapsychologists have reacted with enormous indignation A more promising approach is to try to replicate major experiments Unfortunately , whenever skeptics do this and get negative results , para psychologists invoke their favorite Catch 22 , which is that skepticisn inhibits psi . You will look in vain through the writings of psi journalist like Rogo for references to these replication failures . There have been 141 // for example , several important failures to repeat the Maimonides dream experiments ( see Adrian Parker 's book , States of Mind ) . In some cases , negative results were obtained by the original researchers when they collaborated with skeptical outsiders . Readers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honorton and Schmidt that Rogo does not mention because they conflict with his thesis that modern parapsychology is uncontaminated by Gellergawking . A few years ago , Honorton announced that he had discovered a young lady , Felicia Parise , who was capable of sliding a plastic pillbottle across a kitchen counter by psychokinesis . This great event was witnessed only by Honorton and an amateur photographer , Norman Moses , who caught the event on film . The first thing that occurred to the magician James Randi , when he saw the film , was that a superfine nylon thread was stretched horizontally across the formica counter . A small and empty pill-bottle was standing upright . As Felicia 's long-nailed fingers , on either side of the bottle , crept forward , it would have been a simple matter for her to push against the thread . Fine nylon thread is absolutely invisible , even at close range , but it is easily broken and tends to be elastic . When Randi duplicated the test , he found that the nylon thread stretched when it pressed against the bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner , exactly as seen on the film made by Moses . Last year , for a BBC television show in London , Randi replicated the feat , using a stronger thread and a heavy wineglass . It does not follow , of course , that because Felicia could have used nylon thread that she did , in fact , use it . It does follow that , because Honorton was not sufficiently informed about magic to evaluate what happened , his report of the event can not be taken seriously . Nevertheless , he stands resolutely by his belief that he witnessed a paranormal feat . " I examined the counter , " he told a National Enquirer reporter ( see the December 30 , 1975 , issue , with its front-page headline : " First American to Move Objects with Her Mind " ) . " I virtually took it apart to ensure there was no mechanical aid she could have used to move the bottle . But I found none . I even checked the countertop to see if it sloped . I found there was a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honorton was also present during tests of Felicia at Rhine 's laboratory in 1972 , when she moved a compass needle by PK . ( See Honorton 's " Apparent Psychokinesis on Static Objects by a Gifted ' Subject , " in Research in Parapsychology , 1973 , edited by W. G. Roll and others . ) It is amusing that Honorton , who is highly skeptical of Uri Geller 's PK ability , has spent considerable time Felicia-gawking and defending her powers in lectures and articles . Ms. Parise , by the way , stopped demonstrating her psi abilities several years ago and is no longer available for research . This is another fait accompli that no parapsychologist can replicate when a knowledgeable magician is present . // Let 's take a quick look at Schmidt . You will never learn from Rogo that Schmidt has long been a Geller-gawker . " Another source of particularly strong PK effects may be available in a few highly selected subjects . . . " Schmidt wrote in Edgar Mitchell 's Psychic Exploration . " One such person is Uri Geller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectacular performers studied by earlier workers in the field . Critical researchers . . . have seen Geller bend heavy metal objects mentally , ' just by touching them slightly or even without any touch . " In 1970 , Schmidt reported one of the great breakthroughs in modern parapsychology . Cockroaches , he announced , probably have the PK ability to cause a randomizer to turn on a device and give themselves electric shocks more often than chance allows . However , since Schmidt personally dislikes cockroaches , he admits that his experiment was inconclusive . It could have been his own mind that influenced the randomizer . Walter J. Levy , former director of J. B. Rhine 's laboratory , found that live fertilized chicken-eggs also could influence a randomizer . In this case the randomizer controlled a heat source . " Psi-hitter " eggs kept the heat on longer than chance dictated , while " psi-loser " eggs influenced the randomizer the other way . When the two kinds of eggs were together in the same box , their PK powers cancelled out , and Levy got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught faking his records , parapsychologists have stopped citing his egg papers as references . Cockroaches , however , are still suspected of being psychic . Rogo 's claim that parapsychologists do not waste time on Geller is simply not true . Harold Puthoff and Russell Targ spent vast amounts of time Geller-gawking and finally declared Geller to be a genuine clairvoyant . Thelma Moss is another Gellerite who continually praises Uri . Gertrude Schmeidler is on record with similar remarks , not to mention her well-known tests of the PK powers of Uri 's chief rival , Ingo Swann . We all know about Andrija Puharich 's Geller-gawking ? he wrote an entire book about it . His next book will report on his research with a group of what he calls " Geller children . " One of them , Puharich declared last May at a " Towards a Physics of Consciousness " symposium held at the Harvard Science Center , succeeded in materializing a tree . Six of the Geller children , he said , were teleported to his home in Ossining , New York , from as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris Walker , a physicist who explains Geller 's PK powers by a theory of his own involving quantum mechanics . John Taylor , the British paraphysicist , thinks the " Geller effect " is electromagnetic . Puharich attributes it to tachyons , conjectured particles that go faster than light . But the most popular theory at the moment is Walker 's quantum theoretical explanation . Rhine 's associate , William Cox , is one of the loudest of all Gellergawker squawkers . He has written about the " rigidly controlled " conditions under which Uri caused Cox 's watch to start running after Cox had stopped // the balance wheel with a tinfoil wedge and about how Uri made his key curl " like a burning match . " I exchanged several long letters with Cox about the watch bit . Only Cox was present , and he allowed Uri to handle the watch briefly before it started running . Could Uri , under cover of that misdirection for which he is so famous , have opened the case with a thumbnail and pushed the tinfoil ? No way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might " have accomplished this miracle by psi power ( though I gave it a low probability ) , I was never able to extract from Cox the comparable admission that Uri , to any degree of probability , could have fooled him with a trick . Does Rogo , I wonder , consider Edgar Mitchell a " parapsychologist " ? Mitchell has often described how Uri materialized part of a long-lost tiepin in a mouthful of ice cream . Indeed , one is hard put to think of many parapsychologists who have not been Geller-gawkers . I must add that in recent months their silence about Uri has become deafening as it becomes obvious that Uri has no more psi ability than such performers as Charles Hoy , Kreskin , Dean Kraft , Nina Kulagina , and Matthew Manning . Rogo ends his article by comparing the reputed iron controls of modern parapsychology with the weaker controls of other sciences . Here he missed an all-essential point . Extraordinary controls are not demanded in experiments that demonstrate ordinary results . If , for example , a psychologist seeks to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual controls are not required . Gerbils do n't cheat . But if someone says he or she can move a plastic pill-bottle with PK power , that is an extraordinary claim that calls for extraordinary precautions . In view of the long , hilarious history of fraud and gullibility in psi research , it demands at the very least the participation of the only expert on this kind of deception ? a knowledgeable magician . It is Rogo 's inability to distinguish between these two kinds of investigations , with their different demands for controls , that has made him such a naive and unreliable reporter of the psi scene . Although he shares Honorton 's low opinion of Geller , he has spent many years gawking at haunted houses . In his book An Experience of Phantoms ( 1974 ) , Rogo argues that every person has an etheric double that not only survives death but can project itself as a phantom while the person is still of this world . " Apparitions , as no other phenomenon , " he writes , " bring to the fore that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article in Psychic , " Photography by the Mind , " Rogo praises the laboratory controls of Jule Eisenbud , the psychoanalyst who demonstrated Ted Serios 's ability to project thought-pictures onto Polaroid film . " Ted Serios , " writes Rogo , " does represent the first case of psychic photography to confront parapsychologists in several years . " Rogo regrets that Serios 's ability " appears to have deteriorated , " but he carefully avoids any mention of the famous Popular Photography expose // ( October 1967 ) of how easily Ted could have cheated with an optical device that he palmed in and out of his " gismo . " Almost everybody now ( except Rogo and Dr. Eisenbud ) believes that Ted stopped doing thoughtpictures only because three magicians caught on to the simple method he was using , and poor Ted has been unable to think of any better method . In a more recent article in New Realities ( the new name of Psychic magazine ) , Rogo discusses reports of Madonna statues that bleed in their palms or weep human tears . Does Rogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No . His only problem is deciding whether the blood and tears ( never sweat ? apparently statues of Mary do n't perspire ) are Christian miracles or a form of poltergeist . And in the latest issue of Fate ? but I must spare the reader further disclosures about Rogo 's adolescent enthusiasms . His phantom-gawking is , I submit , closer to the preoccupations of today 's best known parapsychologists than to the few sanitized , unspectacular , and highly dubious experiments that he cites in his article . Postscript The foregoing article was written as a reply to D. Scott Rogo 's " The Case for Parapsychology " in the same issue of the Humanist . Rogo 's letter about my article appeared in the January/February 1978 issue : I do not wish to reply to Martin Gardner 's " A Skeptic 's View of Parapsychology , " a rejoinder to my article " The Case for Parapsychology , " which appeared in the same issue . Most of his arguments need no rebuttal . They are , in fact , only ad hominem arguments . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack some of the researchers of whom I spoke and does not come to grips with their work . However , I would like to correct some of Mr. Gardner 's factual errors ? just for the record . Mr. Gardner states that I did not mention the controversial Popular Photography " exposure " of Ted Serios in my 1970 Psychic article on psychic photography . As a matter of fact , I discussed this affair quite openly in my article ( Psychic , April 1970 , p. 42 ) . . . . Second , Mr. Gardner also states that only Dr. Jule Eisenbud and I seem to take the Serios work seriously anymore . This is , quite frankly , not true . This research is still highly regarded by many parapsychologists . Finally , I attempted to make a " case for parapsychology " in my article . Mr. Gardner only tries to make a " case against Rogo " by way of reply . He does this by criticizing some of my previous publications . What this has to do with the scientific value of parapsychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have researched and written on hauntings , out-of-body experiences , religious miracles , and many other even worse things ! I have done so because I have come to believe that these are phenomena that we 146 A Skeptic 's . View of Parapsychology should seriously study . It strikes me that Mr. Gardner is actually criticizing me only for having the sense to have an open mind on many subjects . I make no apologies for this . I am truly sorry that Mr. Gardner feels that having an open mind is shameful in science . D. Scott Rogo My rejoinder was : Mr. Rogo is right about the first of my two " errors . " He did indeed mention Popular Photography in his Psychic article on thoughtography . He had two sentences about it , which I now quote in full : " Two photographers , C. Reynolds and D. G. Eisendrath , presented evidence in Popular Photography showing that they were able to fake thoughtographs under Eisenbud 's supervision . However , they were not able to duplicate the effects obtained by Serios . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten Rogo mentioned it . Now let 's examine three errors that Rogo managed to pack into his two sentences . First , a trivial one : David Eisendrath 's middle initial is B. Second , the two photographers did not fake any thoughtographs under Eisenbud 's supervision , or claim that they did . Third , they did later duplicate precisely the effects Serios obtained . The Amazing Randi now does the Polaroid trick even better than Ted used to do it and under more controlled conditions . Note also that Rogo does not mention the issue ( October 1967 ) in which the exposes appeared . Let me tell a story about this article that illustrates how difficult it is for skeptics to get cooperation from psychic researchers when they investigate someone like Ted . When Reynolds and Eisendrath left New York for their meeting with Ted in Colorado , I made the stupid mistake of mentioning , in a letter to Dr. J. B. Rhine , that three of my magician friends were planning a session with Ted . ( The third person was statistician Persi Diaconis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly shot a copy of my letter by special delivery to Dr. Eisenbud , warning him that the three men en route to see him had a knowledge of magic . Thus when the three arrived , they were confronted with my letter , a situation that almost blew the meeting . The meeting did take place , but of course Ted was wary . Hundreds of shots were made without a single thoughtograph . Finally , at the close of the last session , Reynolds and Diaconis ( Eisendrath had gone back to New York ) independently saw Ted appear to palm something and transfer it from hand to hand in a manner familiar to magicians . One shot was made ( no results ) , but Diaconis asked afterwards if he could examine the gismo . ( Ted 's " gismo " was a cylinder of black paper that he always held in front of the camera lens . ) Ted asked why , stepped back , and shoved the gismo into his pocket . He later removed it and gave it to Dr. Eisenbud . Dr. Eisenbud had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . At this point , however , Ted became angry , and Dr. Eisenbud upbraided Diaconis for having upset the " psychic . " Dr. Eisenbud could easily have // said , " Ted , our guests think you palmed something and now have it in your pocket . May we examine the pocket ? " Dr. Eisenbud said no such thing , and Ted refused to be searched , so the two-day meeting ended without the production of a single thoughtograph . Dr. Eisenbud invoked the old Catch 22 ? the skeptics had upset Ted ; indeed , he later told Reynolds that the visit had set psychic research back fifty years . My second error , says Rogo , is my statement that " almost everybody " now agrees that Ted has stopped doing thoughtography because his modus operandi was disclosed . When Rogo claims to the contrary that " many parapsychologists " regard the Serios case as still open , I take him to mean that they still believe it is more likely than not that Ted once had the genuine power to stare into a Polaroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photograph he had seen many years before in National Geographic . I would be grateful to Rogo if he would back up this claim by listing the names of prominent parapsychologists who still think this , aside , of course , from himself and Dr. Eisenbud . The only such persons I know are Jan Ehrenwald , Thelma Moss , and Stanley Krippner , but perhaps there are others . Rogo should check with the " others " first , though , before he speaks for them . It would be particularly interesting to know what Rhine now thinks . As for Rogo 's last sentence , it betrays once more how little he comprehends scientific method . Of course a scientist must have an open mind , but there are degrees of probability about the importance of various investigations . For example , one must have an open mind about the reality of fairies . After all , Conan Doyle wrote an entire book about them , complete with excellent photographs . Does the phenomenon of catching elves on film suggest their reality to a degree that warrants government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguish degrees of credibility , along the spectrum that runs from serious science to Ted Serios , that makes his sensationally written books so hilariously irrelevant . Martin Gardner Writing now in 1980 I must concede another point to Rogo . Belief in the authenticity of Ted Serios 's thoughtography has persisted among many leading parapsychologists longer than I would have deemed possible . To those mentioned in my letter as not yet willing to declare Ted a charlatan , I must add the names of Gertrude Schmeidler and Charles Tart . When I had occasion in an exchange of letters with Schmeidler to ask her about Ted , she replied : " With Serios , my impression is that he 's not smart enough to fool Jule Eisenbud whether Serios is drunk or sober , and I trust and respect Jule . Also Pratt , who 's worked with Serios too , and gotten affirmative data . " Tart , in conversations with two of my friends , has repeatedly defended the soundness of Eisenbud 's controls with Ted . As for Rogo , he continues to hack out balderdash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayles , is a book called Phone // Calls from the Dead ( Prentice-Hall , 1979 ) . It reports on conversations with discarnate souls by telephone and other electronic devices . " We 've stumbled on a whole new method of psychic communication ! " Rogo exclaims . Yes , indeedy . And he and Bayles have stumbled on a whole new gimmick for ripping off the yokels . Rogo , in case you did n't know , is a former concert oboist . He should go blow his oboe and stop trying to blow his readers ' minds . I do not know what Rhine 's final opinion was about Serios . The letter that I sent to him ( see above ) was written at a time when I expected to review Eisenbud 's book for Scientific American , a review I did not write . First , my letter to Rhine , dated May 28 , 1967 : Although we remain on opposite sides in our attitude toward ESP , I hope you do n't mind my writing you again about a matter of mutual interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Marquis , the X-ray eye boy . You helped me run down the Life piece on him , and told me about your own tests of him , all of which I made good use of in my Science article on DOP . At least we can agree , from our respective biases , that it is good to expose what we both know to be obvious fraud . I am writing you now because Scientific American has asked me to do a long book review of Eisenbud 's recent book , The World of Ted Serios . I and my magic friends ( including the photographer David Eisendrath , whom you know ) have thought of many simple ways by which Ted could be getting his results , none of them ruled out by a careful reading of Eisenbud 's ridiculous book . We are currently trying to arrange for some tests , at which one or more of us could be present as observers , though I doubt very much if Ted will be willing to perform if he suspects any competent observers are present . It occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serios , which you could send me ; or , if not , you may have some information about him you would be willing to pass on . I might add that anything you tell me is in strictest confidence unless you specifically give me permission to cite you as a source . So if you are willing to express your personal opinion about Ted , or about Eisenbud , please indicate in your letter if I may or may not quote you in my review . Finally , if you have no first-hand information about Serios , perhaps you know of someone ( on the skeptical side ) who has such information , and to whom I could write . Martin Gardner Because Rhine gave permission to quote him only if I quoted his entire letter , a photocopy of the letter is shown on the opposite page . Note that Rhine is too cautious to give an opinion about Ted but expresses his high regard for Eisenbud . It is of course impossible to regard Serios as a fraud and simultaneously to praise Eisenbud for his " skill " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device ? and the evidence is overwhelming that he did ? then Eisenbud is as gullible and self-deceiving as Conan Doyle .
