The U.S. Postal Service is at odds with the Washington Mint . Not the U.S. Mint but a small Connecticut company that makes a 3 1/2-in. medallion called the Giant Silver Eagle . The Postal Service is charging in a complaint to an administrative judge that the Washington Mint 's advertising falsely implies that the company has an affiliation with the U.S. Government . The 12-oz . Connecticut Eagle , which is based on the Federal Government 's popular 1-oz . American Eagle coin , sells for $269 . <P> Frederic Berg , chairman of the Washington Mint , has twice changed his company 's advertisements in response to complaints from the Postal Service . This time he has decided to fight back : " We 're not going to roll over on this . " He adds that the Government 's case is " patently ridiculous . " His company sold all 5,000 of the medallions , about 25 of which have been returned by customers .
