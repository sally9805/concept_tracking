 | The deal is struck , usually , through a lawyer or a specializing agency . A man and a woman who may never set eyes on each other contract to have a baby . The woman will allow herself to be inseminated with the man 's sperm ; if a pregnancy is achieved , she will turn the child over to .. him at birth . She acknowledges that she is doing this for the man and his wife and will not contest custody of the child . In turn , the man consents to pay all medical , legal and insurance costs , as well as a personal fee to the woman , most often $10,000 . In its spare , restrictive language of service and remuneration , it is basically a business transaction like many others . Yet it carries a volatile freight of hopes and fears , of legal and moral implications that make it unlike most others . Thwarted by infertility and the endless snares of the adoption process , a growing number of childless couples are resorting to the costly , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a candidate to bear them a child to the moment the baby is delivered to them , couples may experience agonies of longing and fantasies of crushing disappointment . Even afterward they face a climate of opinion that often holds surrogate parenting to be a form of baby selling . Barry and Adele Cohan , of Pikesville , Md. , finally succeeded in adopting a child after Adele had undergone more than eight years of unsuccessful fertility treatments and the couple had wrestled another four years with adoption agencies . But when they adopted a second child , the mother reclaimed it after a week . " I felt like someone was ripping me apart , " says Barry . Then the Cohans contracted with a surrogate . But they live in fear that she will change her mind about giving up the baby , due in February . Says Harriett Blankfeld , whose Chevy Chase , Md. , agency , Infertility Associates International , has arranged 26 surrogate births in the last four years : " People seeking surrogates have usually exhausted every other possibility and fervently want children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . " To date , around 600 babies have been born to surrogate mothers in this country , but their ranks are multiplying . About one out of six married couples in the United States have infertility problems . As more and more working women postpone motherhood into their mid-30s or early 40s , they run the risk of becoming infertile and , what 's more , finding themselves too old to get on adoption waiting lists . Noel Keane , a Michigan-based pioneer in the surrogate process , helped arrange only eight such births between 1975 and 1981 . But he has overseen 65 since @# @#  | then , and his office is currently working with around 125 more clients . Keane and others in the field believe there may be thousands of surrogate-born children by the end of the decade . It is only in the last 10 years that the arrangement has become formalized , with lengthy documents and medical and psychological tests , as well as substantial fees , for the surrogate mothers . In all , a couple can expect to pay $25,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . Although no state has laws dealing specifically with the procedure , it runs into statutes that prohibit baby selling . Last April , for example , the Kentucky court of appeals ruled that surrogate parenting violated state laws prohibiting payment in cases of adoption unless arranged by licensed adoption agencies . According to Lori Andrews , a Chicago attorney who has studied the problem , 24 states have similar statutes . Another attorney , William Handel , who has arranged 30 surrogate births from his Beverly Hills , Calif. , office , includes in his standard contract a three-page list of possible civil and criminal liabilities . " It 's a brutal document , " he acknowledges . Even putting those hazards aside , there is nothing ironclad about the contract to begin with . Handel 's cautionary document warns that the surrogate mother may breach the agreement " and yet the Adopting Couple may be ordered to pay lifetime medical expense or child support for a child they do n't get . " On the other hand , the father himself may try to renege if the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as troubling . Many people find it hard to condone the idea of a woman willingly bearing a child and then giving it up , presumably under the inducement of a large sum of money . The Roman Catholic Church condemns the practice . " It 's almost a form of adultery , " says Father John Woolsey , head of the Office of Christian and Family Development at the Archdiocese of New York . Clearly , to overcome the legal obstacles and social stigma , infertile couples who turn to surrogate parenting must feel enormous depths of frustration and need . Surrogate mothers themselves often share that sense of urgency about giving what many of them call " the gift of life . " The stories that follow testify to the intensity of feelings experienced by both the donors and recipients of this still controversial gift . She 's here . We 're a family , " exclaimed Linda Aiello last month when a surrogate mother bore her a 6-pound 4-ounce daughter . In a sense , Linda had been waiting most of her life to utter those words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations at 17 , she had refused to believe it . As a child , years earlier , she had taken care of her baby brother after her mother left home and was " devastated " when the family dissolved and her brother was taken from her . " It 's just been bred into me that babies are my life , " she explains . During Linda 's first marriage six years ago , doctors diagnosed a pregnancy that turned out to be , instead , a tumor on her uterus . A hysterectomy ended any hopes she still had of bearing a child . Later she lost out on a chance to adopt when the mother changed her mind at the last minute . Last year Linda 's second husband , Michael , whom she married in 1983 , heard about surrogate parenting on a talk show while driving home from work at an inventory-control firm . The attorney who had tried to help Linda adopt was opposed to the idea . " He more or less said it was glorified baby buying , " recalls Michael , 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adoption waiting list , the Aiellos decided to contact Harriett Blankfeld 's agency in Chevy Chase . Blankfeld does n't allow couples to meet the natural mothers . Instead she gives them pink folders with about 15 pages of detailed medical and psychological background on @# each surrogate . Linda and Michael went through the folders painstakingly , then made their choice and began the long wait . It was a season of sometimes desperate anxiety . For a long time , Linda could not even walk into the room she had set up for the baby in their Ramsey , N.J. , home without panicking . " I was so horrified that there 'd never be a baby , " she says . " Was it just going to be grabbed out of our hands ? " When she finally made herself choose a wallpaper , a polka-dot pattern topped by puffs of cloud , she broke out in a cold sweat . And when she called a friend to tell her she had received a copy of the baby 's ultrasound picture , the friend was less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultrasound , " Linda remembers . " She said , I 'm a mother and I would never give up my baby . ' She thought the whole thing was a scam . I could n't believe what she was doing to me . " But when Linda and Michael brought the baby , Aimee Lynn , home last month ? a dark-haired " doll , " by her mother 's exultant description ? there seemed no question that it had all been worth it . " We 've been planning and fighting like hell for this , " said Michael , " and I do n't see how anybody can find something wrong in it . What 's the crime ? We did this because we love children . I 'm proud of what we did . " Linda emphatically agreed : " Before she was born I was saying I would never live through a year like this again . But now if I win the lottery I 'm going to do it again . I 'll do it five times ! " Even so , there is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their baby . Like many parents of surrogate children , they harbor just the sinister ghost of a suspicion that any reminder of the child might stir second thoughts in her natural mother , and their dawning idyll of parenthood would turn to a nightmare of loss . At 47 , Bill and Betty Meadows had almost everything they could want : a hugely successful retail-nursery business built from scratch , a large house in Sterling , Va. , and two cattle farms . But they missed what was the most exciting thing in their lives , raising children . Their grown son was no longer living at home , and their daughter , a college student , had recently been killed in an automobile wreck . With Betty no longer ovulating , the Meadows decided to adopt a child but were told there would be a 10-year wait . And when they began looking into surrogate parenting , not only their attorney but his wife disapproved . She said , as Betty recalls it , " that any woman who would serve as a surrogate would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Meadows themselves had some misgivings : how , indeed , could a woman give 75  | her child up , they wondered ? Could they handle it at their age if the baby were deformed in some way ? Yet they went ahead . " We had 20 more good years left and decided to do what we wanted most , " explains Betty . The couple contacted an agency and pored through a half dozen surrogate folders before deciding on a candidate who seemed happy and well adjusted . Bill struck it lucky in the fathering process . Doctors routinely advise men to expect four to six artificial inseminations of the father 's sperm monthly before pregnancy is achieved . But his first surrogate became pregnant on the first attempt . By now , at 50 , the Meadows have two small children , Kate Marie , two , and Rocky Joe , one , born of different surrogate mothers . Because of their own advanced age , they had decided from the first it would be two babies or none ? in 20 years ' time a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children resemble their curly-blond-haired father , and Bill is pleased by that visible evidence of biological connection . " I always get a little more satisfaction out of it than if they had been adopted , " he says . Surrogate parents confront issues most couples never have to deal with . One Canadian couple whose baby was delivered by a surrogate last year , for example , told neighbors the child was adopted . " We live in a small , conservative town and I can imagine the repercussions , " says the mother . " She could be seen as something bizarre , as a freak . " There are also such difficult questions as when to tell the children they have a second mother . The Meadows never hesitated . They have already put it to Kate Marie that Betty is her " real " mother and that there was also a " biological " mother who carried her for nine months and must have cared for her very much . Says Bill : " I would want her to respect her biological mother and realize that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they know all their lives they accept it more than if it 's laid on them when they 're 10 or 12 . " Nor does Betty falter when friends ask whether she really loves her two toddlers as much as the two she bore herself . Her answer is straightforward and uncomplicated : " I get the same butterflies in my stomach when I look at them . I love them every minute of the day . " Two years ago Donna Regan and her husband , Richard , were watching a television news feature on surrogate parenting at their home in Detroit . " I poked Richard in the ribs , " remembers Donna , 22 , " and said that 's something I 'd like to do , and he looked at me as if to say , Have you gone crackers or something ? ' " Not by her lights . Although Donna was hospitalized three times for morning sickness while carrying her own son , Steffyn , now four , the pull to have a child for another couple was powerful . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and having a child is the single most wonderful thing I 've ever done . We just adore this child and I could n't imagine someone else not having one . " Donna contacted surrogate-parenting @# pioneer Noel Keane . In March 1984 she gave birth to a baby girl for a Florida couple , and she is currently trying to become pregnant again for a childless couple in Michigan . Donna insists there was no great wrench in the first experience , only a brief moment of sadness when she surrendered the baby girl after having bottle-fed her in the hospital for three days . " When I came home , " she confesses , " I had this overwhelming urge to snuggle and coo , and Steffyn was just a little too big for that . " Vacationing with Richard in Florida six months ago , Donna phoned the couple to tell them she was there . The wife answered the phone and immediately , Donna says , " I could hear that mommy defensive voice . I heard her get scared and it made me feel bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's their child . " Donna , who works as a hostess in a Detroit restaurant , bought a new car with her first $10,000 fee , and she will use the o second to pay some bills that she and Richard , currently laid off from his job as a metal-machine operator , have run up . But she emphatically rejects any implication of baby selling . " People who say that do n't see the emotional value in it , " she argues . " All they see is money changing hands . " Although little is known about the perilous emotional terrain of surrogate parenting , family specialists tend to support Donna 's view . While money is definitely a factor , notes Nancy Reame , an associate professor of parent-child nursing at the University of Michigan , she believes surrogates truly want to make infertile couples happy . Also , they " want to do something important in life and there 's no other chance they 'll have that kind of impact . " Donna would agree . " Nine months of my life is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .
