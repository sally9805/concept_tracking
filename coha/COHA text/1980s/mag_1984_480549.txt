" AND " is used 3,381 times in James Joyce 's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , and occurs on 7,170 occasions in that same author 's Ulysses , from which we can conclude that the latter is a much longer book . It appears oftener than " a " and oftener than " an " ? although its frequency lags far behind " the " ( as regards ubiquity always the winner ) ? and it easily outdoes " or , " " of , " " it , " " oh ! " as well as every other little word that might be presumed to be its rival , even " is , " even " I. " Some snoop has reported that of the number of words we use in ordinary correspondence , nine words ( " I , " " the , " " and , " " you , " " to , " " your , " " of , " " for , " and " in " ) , at one time at least , comprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " barely makes the top ten in frequency of use . Words that get heavy , one might say almost continuous , employment , are invariably short . Suppose " and " were as long as " moreover " ? It would soon mean " moreover , " and drop to an ignominious rate of three in A Portrait , to a sad two in Ulysses , a frequency that will scarcely seed a satisfying life . And if " and " were spelled , say , like " Mesopotamia , " would it receive any use at all ? And what would happen to the ideas it represents , if we were too busy to think them , or to all the various ands in the world we could no longer trouble ourselves to designate ? That ceaselessly constant conjunction of which Hume spoke would now be noted only rarely : when we were forced to remind ourselves of the connection between Punch moreover Judy , or Mutt mesopotamia Jeff . Such is not its or our plight , however . On word William H. Gass is David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St. Louis . The essay published here will be part of a forthcoming book , The Habitations of the Word . lists , the occurrences of " and " are merely numbered , never cited . The dictionary contains " and " only as a courtesy , and out of a traditional conceit of completeness . No one is going to look up " and . " We do not " look up " manhole covers when we visit the city . So it is a squeak we are used to . It passes through the ear , the eye , the mind , unheard , unseen , and unremarked . It can copulate as openly as birds do , the way park ducks wanton on their ponds . Indeed , pigeons are more heatedly complained of , for " and " leaves no poop on public shoulders . As a word , " and " is an amiable nothing . It has n't even a substantiating , an ennobling , function like " the , " which has caused many a philosopher 's hackles to rise . Joyce singled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in Finnegans Wake , although one might argue that while " the " has the last word in the body of the text , it acts only to buckle the belly of the book together , and that the pride of penultimate place is actually given to " a , " ordinarily a halt word , a rhyme chime , a mere space maker , the shallowest exhalation : A way a lone a last a loved a long the . . . where it interrupts the l 's as they Iikker across the tongue : lone last loved long riverrun , past Eve ? and Adam 's , from swerve of shore to bend of bay . . . a . . . a ... a . . . . Just a few lines earlier , " and " had been allowed to perform an equally rocking rhythmical function : And it 's old and old it 's sad and old it 's sad and weary I go back to you , my cold father , my cold mad father , my cold mad teary father . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an " 0 " like a woman into a wrapper : And it 's old and 0 it 's sad and 0 it 's sad and weary ... just as the " C " sound it picks up later will reinstruct our ears so that we hear , in retrospect , And it 's cold and cold it 's sad and cold it 's sad and weary . . . . Of these musical methods , of course , Joyce was a master . The anonymity of " and , " its very invisibility , recommends the word to the student of language , for when we really look at it , study it , listen to it , " and " no longer appears to be " and " at all , because " and " is , as we said , invisible , one of the threads that holds our clothes together : what business has it being a pant leg or the frilly panel of a blouse ? The unwatched word is meaningless ? a noise in the nose ? it falls on the page as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbs , welfare checks or a love affair ; whereas the watched word has many meanings , some of them profound ; it has a wide range of functions , some of them essential ; it has many lessons to teach us about language , some of them surprising ; and it has metaphysical significance of an even salutary sort . " And " is produced initially with an open mouth , the breath flowing out , but then that breath is driven up against the roof , toward the nose , even invading it before the sound is stoppered by the tongue against the teeth . The article " a " can be pronounced " aw , " " A , " " uh , " " aah , " or nearly forgotten , while " the " is " thuh " or " thee , " depending on position and status ; but " and " is only and always " and , " although its length , like many such words that contain the outrush of a vowel , is relatively indeterminate : " aahnn-duh " ? where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next word , filling the voice stream , allowing one 's thought to continue , inhibiting interruptions : " pahst Eeev anduhAandummz .... " In Middle English , and often among the vulgar since , the word has appeared in reduced circumstances , either as a conditional ; an ' it please your lordship , I 'll drop me drawers ; or as a common conjunction : an ' here an ' there the bullets went an ' never touched me nearly . Hollywood nosh nooks , back in the Thirties , bobbed it even further : Dunk ' n ' Dine , their signs said . Sit ' n ' Eat . There was also the nautical spit ' n ' polish , and that enigmatic put-down. shit ' n ' shinola . Although the sound " and " and the word " and " may appear and reappear in sentence after sentence , both in spoken and in written form , there is no single meaning ( AND ) that remains tethered to the token . The word is , perhaps , no sneakier than most words , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds , pulling syllables up over its head . It is , of course , the principal element in " randy , " " saraband , " and " island , " a not inconsiderable segment of " Andorra , " " Anderson , " " andeluvian , " " Spandau , " and " ampersand , " whose elegantly twisted symbol ( the so-called short or alphabetical " and " made by intertwining the " e " and " t " of " et " ) also contains it . " And " also lurks about in words like " spanned , " and in apparently innocent commands like please put the pan down , Anne , as well as in many allegations or simple statements of fact , for instance , that panders and pimps and pushers , panhandlers and prostitutes , stand like so many lamps on the streetcorners . Not only are there more " ands " about than immediately meet the eye , the word by itself in the open is manifold in its meanings , and not in the way that mast words are ambiguous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or guarded vault or sloping river edge ; " rank " signifying something overripe or of military station ; " tank " referring to an armored vehicle , a cylinder for gas or certain fluids , an approximate measure . " And " is ambiguous the way prepositions are , not straightforwardly but curvaciously , almost metaphysically , multiple . Think of the differences designated by the same , seemingly simple , " on " in the poorhouse is on fire , the seafood is on the table , her panties were hanging on the line , their lacy patterns turned him on , now his mind was mainly on Mary . Such words are constantly in transit between meanings , their very indeterminacy an invitation to their contexts to seize and to shape them ; and if tank " were like that , we should sense how we might slide down some weedy slope into the till , or how we might count on a good bounce from our rubber check . Initially a preposition itself , and derived from " end , " the idea of fronting or facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing of something next to but over against something else , such as " up " with " down , " " high " next to " low , " " peace " over against " war . " Later , as various words collapsed into and became " and " ( " ond , " " ant , " " enti , " " anda , " " undi , " " und , " " unt , " " et , " et cetera ) , its function as a relatively neutral conjunction increased . Now not even Proteus can match the magicality of its many metamorphoses . A single example from Gertrude Stein 's " Melanctha " should be sufficient to show our small word 's true and larger nature . She tended Rose , and ' she was patient , submissive , soothing , and ' untiring , while the sullen , childish , cowardly , black Rosie grumbled and3 fussed and howled and3 made herself to be an abomination and ? like a simple beast . " And " #1 She tended Rose , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the adverbial use of " and . " The expression is to be read : " She tended Rose , and in doing so she was patient , submissive , soothing .... " It is not so much that " and " is an adverb here ; rather it determines the nature of application to the verb " tended " of what follows it . We have no grammatical category for this operation . " And " #2 she was patient , submissive , soothing , and untiring . . . . This " and " begins as the " and " of balance and coordination . That is , we have " soothing " on the one hand balanced logically and grammatically with " untiring " like two weights on a scale . Both words belong to the same part of speech ; both are about the same length ; both designate qualities of the same logical order , although " soothed " is 56 something the patient is supposed to feel , while " untiring " is something the nurse is , and , more importantly , looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not alone ; when it is joined , on its side , by two others ; then the balance goes out of whack , and the nature of our " and " begins to alter . patient , submissive , soothing , Q untiring The " and " we now confront means " finally . " It may even mean " and in particular " or " above all . " Death , Donne tells us , is a slave to fate , chance , kings , and finally desperate men . This " and , " then , moves from one meaning to another like a pointer on that imaginary scale it has suggested . It begins by intimating equality and balance , but both its position in the series ( last ) and its separation from the rest ( " and " acts as a barrier ) increase its importance , as if it were significant enough by itself to weigh as much as the other three . Principally , however , this second " and " indicates the approaching conclusion of a list the way certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love your lips , nose , eyes , hair , chin , and hollow cheeks , your big bank account and bust , my dear . Balances are delicate , and easily tipped . The social status of a word , its force , its length , its history of use : anything can do it . Between the words " patient " and " submissive " in the Stein sentence only a comma intervenes , but that comma stands for an " and " whose presence is purely conceptual . It is " and " become ghostly and bodiless . It is the fatuous gleam in Father 's eye . Indeed , one could easily write another essay on the germinal , the spermatic character of this seedy wormEke bit of punctuation . The comma resembles the law , and can command our conscience without a policeman . The absence of the officer is essential to its effect , however , for she was patient and submissive and soothing and untiring is another sentence entirely , and not a very forceful one . To the logician , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and submissive , a connective like " and " or its sometime substitute , the comma , asserts the joint dependency of every element in the pursuit of truth . The logician is outspoken and prefers everything laid out on the bed like clothes for a trip . She ( Melanctha ) was patient ; and she ( Melanctha ) was submissive ; and she ( Melanctha ) was soothing ; and she ( Melanctha ) was untiring , too ? at once and altogether . One can hear what a wearisome way to go at things this is ; and for some of the same reasons we like our workaday words short and preferably snappy , we fold our ideas over whenever we can ? wad them up ? and indicate the folds with commas . The logician 's assertion of mutual dependency of parts where truth is concerned is paradoxical , and tells us a good deal about " and , " because " and , " whenever it interposes its body , separates each quality from the others and insists that we examine them one at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places ( as if we were saying that Melanctha was patient on Tuesday , when she wore her bright blue dress , and untiring on Wednesday in her red riding habit , and submissive on Sunday , when she put on her smart pink smock ) ; as if being patient and untiring were conditions that never affect one another . The logician 's " and " is indifferent to grouping and order . It is all the same to it whether Bill had a boil on his nose and water in the pot , or water in the pot and a boil on his nose , or whether Bill has a boil on his nose , water in the pot , and a plant on the sill , or a boil on his nose and water in the pot , a plant on the sill with its window on the world . To our made-up logician , if Melanctha was soothing , then she was soothing , and while we know that she was soothing , we also know she failed to soothe , for Rose Johnson behaved like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an abomination . Soothing that is not soothing is not exactly the same as soothing that succeeds and soothes . It is much more likely , in fact , to be infuriating . Who , after all , enjoys being placated : there ... there .... In short , in addition to its full appearance as a word , " and " can make itself felt simply as a sound , as in the expression " canned ham , " or it can constitute the underlying meaning of another connective like " but , " or it can exert itself invisibly , as a recurrent idea , a rule of organization . Counting the commas that are stand-ins for it , there are eleven " ands " in Gertrude Stein 's sentence . " And " #3 . . . while the sullen , childish , cowardly , black Rosie grumbled and fussed . . . . Our second " and " drew a list to a close . This third " and " occurs immediately after the commencement of such a series . Certainly " and , " here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in balance , but " fussed " will soon be paired with " howled , " and momentarily find itself in a tray belonging to two different scales . As we pass along the list , accumulating the " ands " of grumbled and fussed and howled and made herself an abomination . . . we must constantly shift our weight , first grouping " grumbled " with " fussed , " then " fussed " with " howled , " and finally , with four characteristics at last in place , comparing the first pair of bad behaviors with the second set . grumbled L fussed howled made herself to be an abomination The specific thing that " fussed " does is add itself to " grumbled , " and the idea of addition , like those of balance , equality , difference , and coordination , is basic to our word , which is often a + sign . Rosie grumbled , and in addition fussed . Additions , of course , can be of many kinds . Sometimes they merely lengthen a list : Darling : remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mop . Sometimes , however , they alter its character , change its direction , either mildly , as I love your lips , nose , eyes , hair , chin , and fallen bosom does , or more radically , as Duckie , do n't forget catsup , kohlrabi , and some conniption , a large can , you know , the kind in sugar syrup . Every addition implies that somewhere there 's a sum . You ca n't add one number to another-8 to 4 , for instance ? if the 8 has disappeared by the time the 4 has come round to be counted . However , ordinary actions are like that . I must stop hopping if I 'm to skip , and halt all skipping if I 'm to jump . My present footstep can not find the others I have made , even their sound on the sidewalk is gone . So " fussed " adds itself to " grumbled " only in the mind of some observer for whom the sum is one of aggravation . To ? Melanetha , Rose Johnson grumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to top it off ) howled . Since Rose did not fuss because she had grumbled , her actions , as external events , merely follow one another in time , and replace one another in space , the way Hume indicates our impressions do ; and this notion of a simple " next ! " is another that is fundamental to the meaning of " and . " Certain things can not be added to others because they are already there by implication . To lamb stew you can not add lamb . Nor is there any sense in saying that In addition to being triangular , their love affair had three sides . Thus , because it is a defining list , in sullen , childish , cowardly , black Rosie , the commas do not replace a plus . Generally , " and " designates only external and unnecessary relations ; it deals with incidentals , separables , shoes that slip on and off ; but not when it means something like " equally true . " A triangle has three sides and it is equally true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And " #4 ... Rosie grumbled and fussed and howled . . . This is the " and " of increasing emphasis . Rosie grumbled and in addition fussed and what 's more howled . It has not lost its coordinate qualities ( indeed it is now operating as a pivot between two pairs ) , and it remains an additive " and " too , but it is now in a place of weight as well . This usually requires that it occupy the last place in any series of conjunctions , and that the items of the set ( in this case , names of actions ) show a corresponding rise , swell . or increase in scope and importance . " And " #5 ... and made herself to be an abom ? ination .. . . Our fifth " and , " since it appears in series with " ands " #3 &; #4 , begins by signaling that it is another addition with emphasis . Indeed , it starts to withdraw some of #4 's culminating force , for it is seen , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows the fifth " and " is not a single verb , which its normal coordinating function would lead us to expect anyway , but an entire clause . Furthermore , while " howling , " " fussing , " and " grumbling " are intransitive verbs , " making " is not . I said a moment ago that addition implies a sum , and there it is : the summarizing , totalizing " and . " Rosie grumbled and fussed and howled and altogether made herself to be an abomination . . . . " And " #6 ... and like a simple beast . Our final explicit " and ' does not occur in a balancing position . Although it is in series , that series , as we have moved through it , has been undergoing transformations . " Fussed " is added to " grumbled , " then " howled " is emphatically attached , and these add up to " abomination . " Now this sum is interpreted and explained by resorting to the " and " of equivalence , to the " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself to be an abomination and that is to say like a simple beast . We can summarize the six different functions of the spelled-out " ands " in Gertrude Stein 's admirably instructive sentence this way : She tended Rose , and in doing so she was patient , submissive , soothing , and finally untiring , while the sullen , childish , cowardly , black Rosie grumbled and in addition fussed and what 's more howled and taken altogether made herself to be an abomination and what is the same thing like a simple beast . So far , we have considered these " ands " as if they existed in relative isolation , in terms of their local impact upon one another , and not in terms of the total effect of their use . But six " ands " have surfaced in this sentence . Each one comes between its companions like a referee . Within most prepositional phrases , for instance , the sense of things follows the reading eye from left to right as seems proper . Look at the little dog - in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the so-called minor and undominant connectors come first , meaning moves toward " dog " then " sweater " like a drain , although with all those adjectives piled up in the second phrase . the drain begins to clog . But our " ands " part their elements while retaining them . They divvy , weigh , equalize , and order . They spread their objects out like dishes on a table . In the following example , Ernest Hemingway , Gertrude Stein 's anderstudy. is working for a kind of fuddled bewilderment and frightened energy by a deliberate misuse of the word . The narrator in the story " After the Storm " has just knifed a man in a bar . Well , I went out of there and there were plenty of them with him and some came out alter me and I made a turn and was down by the docks and I met a fellow and he said somebody killed a man up the street . 1 said " Who killed him ? " and he said " I do n't know who killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside of Mango Key and she was all right only she was full of water . So I bailed her out and pumped her out and there was a moon but plenty of clouds and still plenty rough and I took it down along ; and when it was daylight I was off Eastern Harbor . These " ands " do not establish parallels or connections ; they suggest chasms . Between one act and another ? between turning a corner and meeting a man ? there is nothing . These " ands " condense or skip . They insist upon the suddenness of everything , the disappearance of time , the collision of distant spaces . Of course , these are the " ands " of nervousness , too , of worry and sleeplessness , of sheep leaping fences one after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return , now , to the first " and " of Gertrude Stein 's set of six , we can see that it attaches the entire remainder of our sentence to the initial She tended Rose . . . . This " and " is both adverbial , as we saw , informing us how well and kindly Melanctha took care of Rose , but it is adversarial in addition , setting Melanctha 's conduct sharply over against Rose 's ( who becomes " Rosie " when we learn of her low-class ways ) . So our specimen is made of that opening clause ( She tended Rose .. . ) and a closing phrase ( . . like a simple beast ) that precisely balances it , while between these two segments three four-term series are sung , one that belongs to Melanctha , and two that belong to Rose and describe first her character and then her behavior . At this point we encounter an " and " that has its home within the rhetorical structure itself , for it is as if the sentence 's shape said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissive and Rose was childish , and so on , employing the " and " of simultaneity , of " while . " Cricks may rise and Troysers fall . . . Joyce writes , using the same connective . Sullen Rosie grumbled , the rhetorical form also says : childish Rosie fussed ; cowardly black Rosie howled and made herself to be an abomination and like a simple beast ? a structure that invokes the " and " of consequence and cause . I bought some stock in IBM and the bottom of the market parted like a wet sack . In the single sentence I took from Gertrude Stein , we have now found six overt " ands , " each with a different dominant meaning , five covert " ands , " which hid themselves unsuccessfully under commas , and two " ands " that were implied by the form . Nor does this list ( itself an " and " - producing format ) even remotely exhaust the various senses , sometimes several at the same time , these thirteen " ands " possess , nor did my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one written or spoken token might represent , or do more than suggest something of the dynamics of switching and sliding senses , as readings were anticipated , accepted , revised , rejected , retained . And we have only to glance again at the passage from Hemingway to find meanings for the word we have n't yet examined . You may recall the peculiar formation : Well , I went out of there and there were plenty of them with him . . . . This is the " and " of consequence , in this case inverted so that it becomes an " and " of tardy explanation , the " and " of belated " because . " The narrator got out of there because the man he knifed had plenty of friends with him . " And " sometimes means " in company " or " together with , " as the passengers and all their luggage were hurled from the plane . And Dombey and Son . " And " sometimes means " we may call these things by the same name , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there are doctors and doctors . This use may be regarded as a particularly pronounced example of the differentiating , or " over against , " " and . " " And " ? sometimes means " remember all the incidents , events , ideas , that came before , or just before , this , " as in the famous opening of Pound 's Cantos . And then went down to the ship , Set keel to breakers , forth on the godly sea , and We set up mast and sail on that swart ship , Bore sheep aboard her , and our bodies also Heavy with weeping , and winds from sternward Bore us out onward with bellying canvas , Circe 's this craft , the trim-cored goddess . " And " is sometimes used in the spirit of " you might not believe it , but ... " and as if in answer to an unspoken question . And yes , we did set up mast and sail on that swart ship . Or , at the half we had a ten-point lead , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate human flesh ! Often the dangled or uncoupled " and " expresses surprise or indignation . It is an emphatic form of the remember-what-camebefore " and . " And you talk to ! tie this way , after all I 've done for you ? Here the " and " of consequence has suffered a familiar disappointment . Or , so Peking ; and do you now go to Moscow ? Around some expressions there hover an astonishing number of ghostly forms , whiffs , sibilant suggestions , vague intimations , and these , as well as the more overt relationships that the reader is expected to grasp as a matter of course , help give them a feeling of classic correctness . Mae West 's famous invitation , why do n't you come up and see me sometime ? with its careful softening of a command into ? a question , alters the cliche ? you folks come back and see me soon , you hear ? ? basically by only one word ? " up " ? and that change suggests " bedroom " to my bad ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " come " suggests " climax , " " see me " sounds like " seize me , " and " seed me , " and so on , so that the " and " it contains hums like a tuning fork between all these fainter and further thoughts and their terms . Mae West 's seductive delivery , of course , lets us know how we are to hear her invitation , but " up " is the verbal pointer that prepares us to flush these remaining meanings within range of our gun . Logical and grammatical form ? the fact that " and " is a connective and not an article , an adjective , or a noun ? limit somewhat the meanings that our word may assume , but only somewhat , and there is little in these formal dispositions that can tell us in advance of experience what " and " means . We ca n't even know whether we are going to be dealing with a preposition , a conjunction , or a strange kind of adverb ; yet the ordinary reader is able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ease that never causes us any astonishment : the syntax takes shape simultaneously with the meanings it shapes . For we know what it is to take care of someone . 0 We know what it is to be patient . We have seen patient caring , and the irritable , impatient kind ( we can even imagine impatient patience , as if one were in a hurry to get this period of placid absorbency and affable putting-up-with over with ) , so that when the words call our experiences together in a sentence , the ensuing arrangement , and completed meaning , is the result of our memories of life and our understanding of language . Patience has a history as a human condition that I 've encountered before and occasionally enjoyed ; and the word " patience " has a career as a concept and a mark that I have , myself , seen and heard and written down and uttered . It is the same , to a degree , with all words . That is , I remember their meanings ; I remember my encounters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that the ones in question have commonly kept . However , when I remember these things , I do not do so serially , one fact or feeling , one usage , at a time , as if I were thumbing through an index or flipping through a file . These memories have been compacted and their effects summed , although I may recollect my mother 's patience during one trying time with particular distinctness , or recall the famous " now patience " passage in Finnegany Wake more readily than others . My mind remembers the way trained muscles do , so when I speak and read as well as I walk and bike , then we can say that I have incorporated my language ; it has become another nature , an organ-like facility ; and that language , at least , will have been invested with meaning , not merely assigned it . I may have just learned that " ne plus ultra " signifies an ultimate or utmost point ; nevertheless , the phrase will still stand aside from its referent like politeness at a doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuse With their sign , then the sign is valuable like the coin it resembles ; it is alive , a unity of mind and body that can be taught to sing , to dance . And so what ? The inner order of the " and " is the list , to which we must now turn ? that field where all its objects at least implicitly rest . Here is a brief list of lists : the list that is made up of reminders , shorthand commands ? get X , do Y , check Z ? such as the grocery or shopping list , the list of things to get done before leaving for Europe , before ignition and liftoff , before embarking upon a prolonged affair ; and there are want lists , Christmas lists , and so on , much the same ; then there is the inventory , and the catalogue , the bests and the worsts , restaurants deserving two stars and three forks , statistical tables and other compilations , directories , almanacs , hit lists , dictionaries , deportation orders , delightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that is , only somewhat ? or as chaotic as one made for marketing , ordered only as items pop into the mind , or as supplies run out , and having no real first , middle , most , or honest end . Sometimes particular items will be underscored or starred . Certain " ands " ( the " and " for emphasis , for instance ) often operate like an asterisk . Other arrangements are neutral and simply for convenience , as book lists are often alphabetical . The factors of 8 could be listed in any order without real prejudice , although I prefer 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 to other , more slipshoddy , renditions . Occasionally a book dealer will shelve his books according to author only , instead of by title or subject matter , and then the catalogue 's alphabetical simplicity and the structure of the corresponding state of affairs in his shop will be the same . Among the organizing principles of lists , then , are ( 1 ) things simply come upon , either the way they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as found , for instance , when the police inventory your pockets before putting you away ; ( 2 ) items listed in accordance with some external principle , often so that things can be easily located ? for instance , numerically , alphabetically , astrologically , regimentally , hermeneutically ; and ( 3 ) items ordered by the order of things themselves , like a book 's table of contents , or vice versa , as when the library 's catalogue shelves the books , and commands their connections . We must suppose that God 's list of things to do ( on the first day ? light ; on the second day ? land ; on the third day ? life ; and so on ) possessed a hidden internal principle , and there may be other self-generating lists of this kind . Lists are juxtapositions , and often employ some of the techniques of collage . The collage , of course , brings strangers together , uses its " ands " to suggest an affinity without specifying what it is , and produces , thereby , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential elements of a truly contemporary style . Lists ? full of " ands " as they are ? remove things from their normal place , not as an artist might , by picking up a piece of paper from the street to paste up on a canvas ( as the romance maintains ) , but by substituting for such found objects their names , and then rearranging those . As a consequence , lists are dominated by nouns . Here is a little list of words of the sort that rarely ap-60 pear on lists : " always " is never there , or " nevermore " or " if ' ( although there is the expression do n't give me any ifs , ands , or huts ) , less than occasionally " subjugation , " " halfheartedly , " " yeah , " or " Lithuaneousness . " Even some nouns , like " junta , " manage to stay quite away . However , adjectives of a usefully descriptive kind . those quiet , unassuming servants of nouns , frequently appear : yellow cheese , large eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctuation most associated with lists is therefore the colon , for presumably everything that follows it is a list . As we know , the colon is frequently an abbreviation for " namely , " or " for instance . " There are thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird : ( namely ) on Sunday . in the yellowing woods , with a friend , following a thin fall rain , and so forth . Lists sometimes suggest or supply alternatives , not necessarily exclusive , for example , ways of getting spots off tea trays , or means of travel that avoid Cleveland . They supply possibilities : the people who could ride on the cow catcher , the games you could play in a stadium : roller-skating the ramps , playing checkers on an empty seat , hide-and-seek . If I am drawing up a list of physical attitudes or comportments surprisingly suitable for sex , although there is an implicit " and " standing between each ( while leaning wearily against your partner like the man with the hoe , as though sitting slowly down upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put all of these to use one after another as though loading groceries in a cart . These " ands " resemble " or " more than they resemble themselves . Lists have subjects . They are possessive . Lists are lists of . There is the list of foodstuffs needed for the ascent of Everest ; there is the ruck one finds in a rucksack , items up for auction , wines and prices ; while the little leaflet , the roster sheet , the penciledin dance card , the back of an old envelope on which a list has been made : each of these symbolizes the table top or field or sorting tray , rucksack or room , where we may imagine these items have been assembled . This is sometimes called " the site . " Since a list has a subject to which its items are constantly referred , it suppresses its verb ( to buy , to remind , to count , to store ) , and tends to retard the forward movement of the mind . We remain on the site . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the later ones run breathlessly in place ; thus the list is a fundamental device for creating a sense of overflow , abundance , excess . We find it almost invariably so used in Rabelais , and often in Cervantes . Why name one thing when you can invoke many ? Why be merely thirsty , why simply drink , when you can cry out with Grangousier : " I wet , I dampen , I moisten , I humect my gullet , I drink ? and all for fear of dying of aridity ! " Here , however , our list is not one of alternative actions , but of additional words . I could say " moisten my gullet " ; or I could say " dampen my gullet " ; but , by the cerebral swillings of all the sophists , I shall say both , and more , in order to suggest the generous great gulp of life I am presently swallowing . Who , indeed , could be satisfied to say , of the breasts of their beloved , simply that they are as white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dass ist ! Lists , then , are for those who savor , who revel and wallow , who embrace , not only the whole of things , but all of its accounts , histories , descriptions , justifications . They are for those who like , in every circumstance , to Thomas Wolfe things down , to whoop it , Vvhitmanly , up . " Ands " run from Wolfe as if he were a faucet for them . And before and after that , and in between , and in ? and out . and during it and later on , and now and then , and here and there , and at home and abroad , and on the seven seas , and across the length and breadth of the five continents , and yesterday and tomorrow and forever ? could it be said of her that she had been promiscuous ? Even the jeremiad is a list , and full of joy . Damnations are delightful . Lists are finally for those who love language , the vowelswollen cheek , the lilting , dancing tongue , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " and . " Life itself can only be compiled and thereby captured on a list , if it can be laid out anywhere at all , especially if you are a nominalist . List-making is a form of collecting , of course , conservative in that sense , and dictionaries are the noblest lists of all but lists are ubiquitous in literature . It is not merely Walt Whitman who is made of them . They are as frequent a rhetorical element as " and " is a grammatical one . We could scarcely write much without either . When do we have a list , however , and when not ? There is no limit , presumably , to the length of lists so long as they have one , for the idea of a list implies the possibility of a complete enumeration . I may not have completed my list of all the cars with Delaware license plates that have stopped at my gas station , but an end is in sight , for my cancer is incurable and the station will soon close . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flap of our envelope , we have n't a list yet , though we may have begun to make one ; it awaits the " and . " " Kleenex and cauliflower " is only a pair , ? and pairs are opposed to lists , and close upon themselves like clapping hands ( though I wonder what sound this pair would make when they came together ? ) , while " Kleenex. cauliflower , and catnip " is simply a skimpy plurality . Alliteration actually makes the three items seem more numerous than they are , so I think that with four such we can say our list has truly begun . When I wrote down " catnip " I did not add it to a list , for there was n't a list yet ; but now that we have one , various things can be said to be on or off it , or eligible for inclusion or not . The phrase fate , chance , kings , and desperate men forms a list . Notice , however , that until there 61 was a list " fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it ; but that , once the list was made , " fate , " we see , was always on . There are some lists one wants rather desperately to be on : the Honor Roll , for instance ; but some should be shunned , like the Lord High Executioner 's little list of people who surely wo n't be missed , or that other roll call way up yonder for which one does not wish to be eligible just yet . Although the list by itself is a small democracy , and usually lacks hierarchies ( the 1,003 women on Don Giovanni 's are , presumably , all loved equally by the fist , if not by the Don ) , when the list occurs in a literary work , these conditions change , and the order of items becomes especially important . " Ah hah ! " Holmes exclaims , our suspect has put down " catnip " before " Kleenex . " Of course , like Holmes 's cases , works of literature suffer from an excess of the essential . The normal democracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and , " as well as its additive and merely enumerative character : How do I love thee , let me count the ways . . . yet even though the " ands " of emphasis , or of " finally , " or " in sum , " introduce certain small subordinations , the importance of every " and , " and the elements it connects , even its pecking orders , remains substantially the same . I 've pointed out that listing things , or inserting an " and " between them , can only be done by replacing the things with their names , and thereby transforming their relations . If you are moving , and have made a list of your belongings so that the insurance company can repay you when the wagons are lost crossing the mountains , the spatial relation between these objects ( between hairbrush and table , table and footstool , footstool and rug ) will be replaced ( as it just was ) with a simple serial relation between indifferent nouns that find their rest , now , only on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby to have my naked picture taken will be listed in the same way as yours ? one woolly rug ? though it was there you lost your virginity , and he lay one tan hand beneath the frillies of your tennis dress , and ? . Nothing but a list can restore such moments to us . A list can calmly take apart a chair , and reduce its simultaneous assemblage to a song : back , leg , cushion , square feet , embroidery , grease spot , saggy spring , slight scratch , small tear , lost tack . If I cut up an action for inclusion on a list , I shall have to divide it the way the flight of Zeno 's arrow was divided , and a continuum will become an enumeration . He ran rapidly forward , leaped , and comfortably cleared the hurdle makes three acts out of what was once one , and these segments can be moved about like beans . Landing awkwardly on his left leg , he knew his run had been rapid enough for his leap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here , is no longer an action , but a memory . Indeed , I can cut up the action in a lot of ways , slicing He ran rapidly forward into a stride with the right foot , a stride with the Ieft , and so on , even becoming microscopic : shove og right , lift , swing , extend , plant , pull , etc. , and in this way never reach . ing , any more than Achilles does , the hurdle . The camera is such a list maker , because a film is essentially a series of stills , temporally arranged and uniformly flashed so as to restore continuity at the price of illusion . Can one word make a world ? Of course not . God said : es werde Licht , not " Licht " alone . ( It is my suspicion that God speaks German . ) But when an " and " appears between any two terms , as we have seen , a place where these two " things " belong together has been implied . Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sundered , for we must think of chaos , Tiefe , not as a helter-skelter of worn-out and broken or halfheartedly realized things like a junkyard or potter 's mid-den , but as a fluid mishmash of thinglessness in every lack of direction , as if a blender had run amok . " And " is that sunderer ; it divides into new accords ; it stands between Himmel und Erde ; it divides light from darkness . " And " again moves between sea and sky and their several waters , so that a new relationship arises between them , one that is external and uhencumbering , although intimate as later will be Eve and Adam . Dividing earth from ocean , grass from earth , summer from winter and night from day , is again : " and . " And those that crawl are otherwise than those that fly because of it . Finally , of course , between Himself and Himself there came a glass , a gleaming image : God and man , then . And among man the male and the female , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , were sorted and set , as though in left and right hands , beside but separate from one another . And then God went away to other delights , an Reiz und Kraft , leaving us with our days and nights and other downfalls , our sites and lists and querulous designs and petty plans , our sentiments and insatiables and dreamlands , with the problem of other minds , with the spirit 's unhappy household in the body , with essences and accidents and no insurance , with all those bilious and libelous tongues , pissing angels , withheld rewards , broken promises , all those opportunities for good and evil , sex , marriage , world wars , work , and worship ? and with " and " : a sword that cleaves things as it cleaves them . And then some .
