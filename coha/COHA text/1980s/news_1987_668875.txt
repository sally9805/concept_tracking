The real Bears are the real National Football League ' s only remaining undefeated team . Reasons they are apologizing : 1 . Walter Payton is no longer smiling so much . When something is wrong with Walter , something is wrong with the whole thing . They are no longer a dominating running team . After leading the league in rushing for four consecutive years , their quest to extend it to an unprecedented five is fading fast . They are 17th , 13th not counting the strike games . Coach Mike Ditka has blamed himself for abandoning plans to run too soon . It is an annual problem he usually overcomes . Ditka also points to game situations in which the Bears have uncharacteristically fallen behind and decided they couldn ' t run . Others have blamed Ditka ' s awkward lineup of Neal Anderson at fullback and Payton at halfback , with Anderson running halfback-type plays and Payton running fullback-type plays . Others have blamed the offensive line , the most convenient scapegoat . Others have blamed Payton , period , although he hasn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payton blamed himself last week , telling reporters , " Sometimes , I feel like I ' m the problem here . " He said he even cried about it . Payton said he was upset because buddies Matt Suhey , Calvin Thomas and Thomas Sanders aren ' t getting enough playing time . " I felt , if I ' m the problem , why not alleviate the problem ? " he said . " Not for my sake , but for the people I care about . " Will he quit early ? No . Will he be traded ? Impossible . The deadline is past . Will he get the ball more ? Perhaps . Will he get benched ? TV commentator John Madden said Ditka told him he couldn ' t bring himself to do that . Why did Payton pick last week to vent his frustration ? " I can ' t go on feeling the way I was feeling when I came up here , " he said . " It was killing me . " Against Green Bay last week , Thomas and Sanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first carries since before the strike . Suhey caught his first pass since the season opener . Payton was on the sideline in critical situations , and after the game Ditka vowed he would continue to use Thomas , Sanders and Suhey more . So Payton should have been happy last week instead of sad , right ? Backfield coach Johnny Roland had a different view . " Walter is down and depressed because he ' s not being used , in his mind , to the best of his abilities , " Roland said . " Walter can still play . " Payton is nothing if not a competitor . He wants the ball . The touchy situation won ' t go away until he gets it , or until he goes away . The Bears aren ' t the only team with too many running backs and not enough running plays . The Dallas Cowboys have Tony Dorsett and Herschel Walker and are 21st in the league in rushing . " I ' ve always been a running back , but the Cowboys have me playing wingback and flanker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I haven ' t enjoyed playing with the Cowboys . I ' m a decoy . If I can ' t help the Cowboys , maybe they should send me someplace else . " The Los Angeles Raiders have Marcus Allen and Bo Jackson and are fifth in rushing but have won only three games . Since Jackson arrived , Allen ' s production has slipped . So far , Allen has avoided the Eric Dickerson-Herschel Walker school of complaint . When the Bears can ' t run , or don ' t try to run , everything else erodes . " Teams that run 40 times win , " Ditka said . " When you start not doing that , you start winning games the way we ' re winning them , with heroics . " Running kills the clock and creates field position , two necessities for great defense . Passing may put points on the board , but it often doesn ' t take enough time off the clock or give a defense field position . But as Ditka said , " I don ' t care how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1985 . " I think we ' ll always be compared to 1985 , " center Jay Hilgenberg said . So will every team that comes along until one goes 15-1 , shuts out two playoff teams and wins the Super Bowl 46-10 . Since it didn ' t happen in the first 65 years of pro football , why should it suddenly start happening every other year ? Seasons like that simply don ' t come along more than once a century . Consider this : Jim McMahon was out for three games that season . The Bears won them anyway by a combined score of 104-3 . You could look it up . The 1984 San Francisco 49ers or the 1986 New York Giants did not compare to the 1985 Bears. 3 . It is 1987 . At the moment , this is the year of the San Diego Chargers . An average team buoyed by a 3-0 strike record , the Chargers are the current darlings . The Bears are old stuff . William " the Refrigerator " Perry isn ' t cute anymore ; Lionel " Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " quickly turned from a popular hit to a fundraising controversy . It is too soon for it to become an oldie but goodie. 4 . What goes around comes around . Since the real Bears still have lost only three games since Super Bowl XX , they still are considered the team to beat by every other team . When the Bears slap high-fives and roll dice and talk trash every time they make a tackle , it is no wonder that opposing coaches work overtime trying to excite and incite their own players to compete . Did you catch the Packer coaches screaming at Perry and calling him a " fat  --   --   --   --   --   --  " last Sunday ? " The Bears are the cream of the National Football League right now , " Denver coach Dan Reeves said . Every coach says that every week , but what exactly does it mean ? According to Hilgenberg , it means coaches are evaluating their own players by comparing them to the Bear players . " Players are highly motivated to go against us , " Hilgenberg said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week : " We ' ve got to have guys like Mike Singletary , who , when you ' re not playing well , he ' s in your face right now on the field . He gets the Chicago Bears foaming at the mouth and they shut you down . You might be ahead , but the game ' s over . You ' ve made your last first down. " 5 . Injuries . Until the loss of Dan Hampton and Otis Wilson last week , the Bears had avoided most major injuries over the last few years , not counting McMahon . In 1985 , they played the whole season without the depth of safety Todd Bell and linebacker Al Harris , unsigned free agents . It made defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan furious that management would take the risk of blowing a special season . An injury to strong safety Dave Duerson , for example , might have been catastrophic . It was more a tribute to luck than to fiscal responsibility that the Bears got away with it . Every team plays despite injury . McMahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinnon caught up with the 1986 Bears . Injuries to Hampton and Wilson only put the Bears on a level with other teams trying to overcome inevitable injury attrition. 6 . Lineup changes . Besides changing Payton ' s role , the Bears have made other concessions to age that are taking time to iron themselves out . Gary Fencik is the team ' s all-time leading interceptor . The free safety lost his starting job during the preseason . The Bears have only five interceptions this year , a league low . Fencik ' s replacement , Duerson , is changing from strong safety to free safety . Although he is a more natural free safety than a strong safety and has more range than Fencik , he has no interceptions . Tight end Emery Moorehead , who will be 34 in March and is the team ' s oldest player , apparently is being phased out by Ditka and shares time with Cap Boso , who is still learning the audible system . Suhey hasn ' t carried the ball once yet and has been in the lineup only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t unleashed Wilber Marshall . Marshall thinks he could have more interceptions if he were allowed to cover more backs and tight ends man-to-man . Although zone defenses are supposed to create more opportunities for interceptions , Marshall has none so far after picking off five last year , high among all NFL linebackers . " The situation they put me in is a lot different from last year , " Marshall said . " They don ' t put me out there anymore . I only do exactly what they tell me to do . " " We don ' t play zone so well , " Ditka said . " It ' s no secret . " According to defensive coordinator Vince Tobin , Marshall ' s role has not changed much . " Sometimes , Wilber wants to do too much , " Tobin said . " In any defense , you have to fulfill your responsibility first . " Marshall already has five quarterback sacks . He had 5 1/2 all last year . The increased blitzing role has sometimes taken him out of coverage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bears designed more things around him the way the New York Giants revolve their defense around Lawrence Taylor . " I ' m not that dominant player , " Marshall said . With Wilson now out , Marshall ' s responsibility may increase. 8 . The players ' hearts remain on strike . This is the intangible that no one can really explain . Or dares to . " The strike is not on my mind when I ' m out on the field , " said Bell , but he admitted , " There ' s something that ' s missing . " The players say they have the intensity , but they keep making mental mistakes . " I guess guys aren ' t concentrating , " defensive tackle Steve McMichael told a luncheon crowd . Marshall said it is difficult to listen to the crowds now and forget how the fans abandoned them during the replacement games . " You walk out there and see all these people ; they were booing us a couple weeks ago , " Marshall said . " Guys have realized we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it changed a lot of things . " It also is difficult to listen to a coach who ridiculed them publicly , even though he apologized after the strike . Ditka admitted , " It ' s like when I talk to them , they don ' t really want to hear me anymore. " 9 . Coin flip . The real reason the real Bears are struggling is they haven ' t won a single coin flip all season . " We take turns calling it , " said Singletary , one of five co-captains . " Personally , I don ' t mind losing it because I like to go out first ( on defense ) . " But it hasn ' t worked lately . " It will , " Singletary said. 10 . They have no choice . Fans and media force the Bears to apologize . The players have spoiled the city . " We ' re 7-1 and winning games , and all everybody ' s talking about is what ' s wrong , " McMichael said . " I ' m sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , " guard Tom Thayer said . " I think it ' s too early to get everybody panicked , " Hilgenberg said.
