When Ralph and Christine Dull of Brookville , Ohio , arrived in the Ukraine last spring , they thought they knew what to expect . After all , they had visited the Soviet Union six times since 1983 under the auspices of international peace groups . They believed the U.S. was not doing enough to help promote peace and understanding , so they decided to take matters into their own hands . " We felt that it was up to the American people to establish contacts with the Soviets . " Now near the end of their sojourn , however , the Dulls are finding that their ideals of cross-cultivation do not so easily take root . <P> Working with the Soviet embassy in Washington and the Soviet Ministry for Agriculture , the Dulls set up a unique Soviet-American farm-exchange program . They would spend six months on the Ukraina kolkhoz ( collective farm ) , while a Soviet farmer , Viktor Polormarchuk , worked on their spread back in Brookville . ( From his letters home , Polormarchuk 's wife Valentina reports that her husband is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some private farming of his own when he returns to the Soviet Union . ) " Mikhail Gorbachev 's new proposals ( ( for liberalizing the economy ) ) fit in exactly with what we think about independent farming , " says Ralph Dull . " We were very interested in the changes taking place in Soviet agriculture , and we wanted to be part of that change . " <P> Ralph , 60 , who customarily wears red-and-blue-checked shirts and blue jeans , drives around the 12,000-acre Ukraina collective farm , which lies just 100 miles from the Rumanian border , as if it were his own 2,000-acre spread in Ohio . He walks the fields , checking the condition of the crops , and drops by smelly cow barns and even smellier pig farms to dispense tips about raising livestock . In the evening Ralph gives lectures and shows American agricultural films . Christine , 54 , a petite ex-schoolteacher , likes to engage the farmers and their families in conversation . <P> Though they live in the small village of Makov ( pop . 4,754 ) , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulls are comfortably housed in a former Communist Party hunting lodge in the midst of a game reserve teeming with wild animals . The Dulls have been given a car and gasoline and receive a monthly stipend of about $700 apiece . Soviet farm workers make as little as 90 rubles ( $140 ) a month . <P> When he arrived , Ralph Dull thought he could best assist his Soviet friends by serving as a kind of senior adviser who would help the Soviets improve their outmoded agricultural methods . He had not expected to work in the fields . <P> But some of the Soviets had other ideas . One of them was the collective 's chairman , Vitali Vladimirovich Stengach . A large , ruddy-faced man with a deceptively jovial manner , Stengach wields power on the kolkhoz , answering only to the local party authorities . Sitting in his huge office and guzzling a glass of the natural mineral water famous in the area , Stengach pours out his complaints . Says he : " We thought we would give him land to grow whatever he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractors , herbicides and combines , so he could show us what can be done . As it turns out , he 's a bezdelnik "  --  the Russian word for loafer.
