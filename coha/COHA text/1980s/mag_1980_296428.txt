A KURT WEILL CABARET <P> The chemistry of kindred souls engineers a rare alchemy in the theater . Put Colleen Dewhurst and Jason Robards together in a Eugene O'Neill play under the direction of Jos Quintero and something memorable occurs . The affinity of feeling between the creator and the re-creators actually propels the drama into a new dimension of the spirit . That happened with the trio 's revival of A Moon for the Misbegotten , a flawed play that may never seem so moving again . <P> Something similar occurs when Martha Schlamme and Alvin Epstein sing the Berlin and Broadway songs of Kurt Weill , as they are now doing at Manhattan 's Bijou Theater . Singing is a singularly inadequate word ; reincarnation is distinctly more appropriate . When these two are onstage , the audience is inside the skulls and the sensibilities of Weill and his most potent collaborator , Bertolt Brecht . One immediate impression is that the lyricist always has an enormous impact on the composer . Rodgers and Hart is light-years away from Rodgers and Hammerstein . In like fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a totally different realm from The Saga of Jenny of Lady in the Dark with lyrics by Ira Gershwin ( " Jenny made her mind up when she was three/ She , herself , was going to trim the Christmas tree. / Christmas Eve she lit the candles - tossed the taper away. / Little Jenny was an orphan on Christmas Day " ) . <P> To be transported in a time machine to a different tonality of mood , one has only to listen to Moritat ( Ballad of Mack the Knife ) . Datelined 1928 , here is the authentic shiver of Nazi gangsterism stalking the streets of doom . All the great numbers follow - Alabama-Song , Surabaya Johnny , Bilbao Song , Ballad of the Pimp and the Whore . In all these songs , a caustic social vision is wedded to a winningly expansive lyricism . This Cabaret is a feast for Broadway .
