The Enchilada Millionaire <P> Mexican-food chains are hotter than chili peppers <P> The margaritas are smooth and strong at Chi-Chi 's in Milwaukee , and the spicy enchiladas pack a punch . Crowds fill the gaily colored restaurant every noon and night . Such enthusiasm for Mexican dining was once largely confined to the Southwest , but now Chi-Chi 's and other aggressive chains are sweeping through the heartland like modern conquistadors . With moderate prices and robust fare , they are capturing an ever growing chunk of the American dining-out dollar . Mexican-style eateries gulped down a hearty $3 billion in revenues last year , or nearly 4% of total U.S. restaurant sales . They bit off only $1 billion as recently as 1977 , by contrast , and accounted for less than 2% of spending for away-from-home meals . <P> Not even the recession , which has cut deeply into many other parts of the restaurant business , has been able to cool the Mexican boom . The slump may , in fact , have helped fuel the explosive growth . Reason : many working mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that Mexican food can be salvation for the budget . The average dinner-and-drink tab is less than $10 at leading Mexican dining spots . Notes Alan Creditor , a top food analyst with the Wall Street firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert : " Mexican restaurants have two things that are very attractive to Americans-taste and a good price . " <P> The south-of-the-border binge has been a bonanza for restaurateurs like Ramon Gallardo , 45 , a-Mexican immigrant and ex-dishwasher who opened a St. Louis dining spot called Casa Gallardo just six years ago . The place quickly became so popular that General Mills purchased it in 1979 and immediately began building Casa Gallardo restaurants from Florida to Ohio . The chain ( 1981 sales : $20.4 million ) now has 17 outlets and will soon open seven more . Gallardo , who was promoted from Casa Gallardo president to chairman last June , now drives a silver Mercedes and lives in a posh St. Louis suburb , next door to a restaurateur for whom he used to work as a cook . Says he : " They ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else could this kind of thing happen to someone who used to wash dishes ? " <P> Larry Cano , 58 , has also cashed in on the Mexican craze . A World War II veteran who was once a bartender , Cano opened the first El Torito restaurant in Southern California in 1954 . He had 22 eateries by the time WR . Grace &; Co. bought him out in 1976 for 450,000 shares of Grace stock , worth about $17.5 million at current prices . At Grace , Cano is president of El Torito-La Fiesta Restaurants ( 1981 sales : $150 million ) ; he has expanded the division into a 90-unit operation with restaurants strung from Tacoma , Wash. , to Tampa . Up to 15 will be added next year . <P> No other company has gained more from the rage for Mexican dining than Louisville-based Chi-Chi 's ( fiscal 1982 sales : $35.8 million ) , the growth champion of Latin chains . The five-year-old firm opened its first unit in a converted A &; P supermarket in Minneapolis , and now has 73 restaurants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chi 's profits to $4.5 million in its latest fiscal year , nearly double the level of the previous year .
