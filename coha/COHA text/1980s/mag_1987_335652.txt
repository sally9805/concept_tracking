Fifteen years have passed since Congress overwhelmingly endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment . Five years have elapsed since the measure , battered by scare talk of homosexual marriages , unisex bathrooms and female combat duty , went to its death , just three states shy of the 38 needed for ratification . Yet the ERA 's 24 key words  --  " Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex "  --  simply refuse to go away . Fifty-one Senators are now cosponsoring an effort to launch the amendment again , and the National Organization for Women has begun a bicentennial drive to revive it . <P> Although most feminists continue to embrace the amendment , the current call to battle has met with a mixed reaction . Many of the amendment 's staunchest advocates are concerned that an ERA campaign now might unwisely divert energy from efforts to tackle such specific and pressing concerns as parental leave , child care and pay equity . " I do n't think one amendment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very important to have , " says veteran Feminist Betty Friedan . " It 's necessary but not sufficient . I do n't want to put all my eggs in that one basket . " Many ERA supporters are wary of fighting another losing battle . " There would have to be a consensus building up in the country that we just have to have the ERA , " says Donna Shalala , the newly named chancellor of the University of Wisconsin at Madison . " I do n't sense it 's there now . " <P> The lack of momentum stems in part from a series of Supreme Court decisions . Since the early 1970s , the court has used the 14th Amendment 's equal-protection clause to strike down gender discrimination , thereby rendering the ERA somewhat redundant . Moreover , like the 14th Amendment , the ERA would apply only to government action . For instance , while it would offer protection to female government workers at the federal , state and local levels , it would not shield women from abuses by private employers . <P> Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In recent years various successful statutory and judicial actions have advanced equal rights in situations in which the ERA might not apply . Women have been particularly heartened by a new flurry of Supreme Court decisions , most of them dealing with the workplace . Last March the court gave affirmative action a significant boost when it upheld the promotion of a woman over a marginally more qualified male employee in California . Two months earlier the court ruled that a state may require employers to guarantee job reinstatement to women returning from maternity leaves . In June 1986 the Justices ruled that sexual harassment in the workplace is illegal . Last May the court held that states may compel some private all-male clubs to admit female members .
