A mercurial superstar tours in triumph <P> Hey , great news : David Bowie 's back , and blooming . <P> Good question : Which one ? <P> There are so many to choose from . It has been a long professional life by rock-'n ' - roll standards , and a diverse one by any other . In a hurricane-force career that has swept over a decade , lost force sometimes but never blown out to sea , David Bowie has tried on almost as many private roles and public personas as he has written songs . In the ' 60s there was the strutting London mod . Then the sensitive singer-songwriter . Then in 1972 Bowie became the hero of his own concept album , Ziggy Stardust , playing the part in concert and , increasingly , letting it play out in life . <P> He led the Glitter Rock movement , turned himself into music 's most exquisite artifact , then turned away . Subsumed in his own myth , Bowie became a zombie , sending back musical dispatches from the dead zone . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recluse , but he kept making records ( " pale blinds drawn all day , nothing to read , nothing to say " ) , strange albums full of pity and doubt . He was a soul , not lost but stranded , who willed himself into a survivor . <P> That incarnation , the current one , resplendently straight and sincere , is riding the high crest of a huge success and a resurgent career , bringing a lot of history to new songs with lines like " I 'm lying in the rain/ But I never wave bye-bye . " So hello , David Bowie . All of you . <P> At 36 , the oldest fresh force in rock , this new Bowie seems to share few qualities with old Ziggy , the polymorphous camp extravaganza , the most gilded lily of rock 's gaudiest age . What binds these identities together is a gift that is cerebral and carnal , frequently danceable and always entertaining . His former crony Lou Reed has sung about it . Deep down inside , Bowie has a rock-'n ' - roll heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's Dance , a record of shrewd and unsentimental dynamism , could be his biggest . It has sold more than 1 million copies , fielded one hit single and two excellent Bowie videos that are holding down heavy air space on MTV . The album and its gold-record title track are also buttressing Bowie 's current tour , a blitzkrieg that has sold out stadiums all over Europe ; in Gothenburg , Sweden , Edinburgh and Paris , he beat last year 's Rolling Stones ' attendance records . For a charity concert in London , scalpers got $150 a seat . <P> Bowie arrives in North America this week . First stop , Canada . Then , in mid-July , on to the States . Tickets for the two Los Angeles concerts sold out in 90 minutes . In New York , you have a better chance of hailing a cab driver who looks like Ziggy Stardust than getting two seats at Madison Square Garden for the original 's own gigs on July 25 , 26 , 27.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
