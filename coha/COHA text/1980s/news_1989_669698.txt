The drab , low-slung Adam mosque - once the heartbeat of the Muslim resurgence in this working-class district - stands deserted , guarded around the clock by police . Four plots of grass nearby are all that ' s left of the market destroyed by security forces last December after fundamentalists allegedly stabbed to death a police officer . The Islamic radicals of Ain Shams have been arrested or forced underground. // // ' ' The bad ones are in prison and the others have shaved , ' ' a local merchant observes laconically , referring to the decision of many religious Muslims to remove the beards that identify them as fundamentalists. // But the government has won only a temporary respite in its long-term war with religious extremists over the kind of state Egypt should be , many analysts believe . And a political storm is now raging over the tactics used by the government to quell their activities - a storm that threatens to alienate President Hosni Mubarak from a wide swath of Egyptian moderates. // At the center of the storm is controversial Interior Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has liberally used a 1981 emergency statute to justify a harsh crackdown , including the use of torture , against Islamic extremists. // Opposition sources claim that in carrying out the crackdown the government has put several towns under siege and harassed opposition parties that have been campaigning for civil rights . They say the government is lashing out blindly , relying on force rather than negotiations because it has no clear policy for dealing with the extremists. // During the last three years the government has detained 6 , 000 fundamentalists , at least 300 for extended terms , according to Adel Hussein , editor of Al Shaab , the newspaper of the Islamic Alliance . ( The Alliance is a coalition of the Socialist Labor Party and the Muslim Brothers , a group that shuns violence in its efforts to bring about an Egyptian Islamic state. ) // Meanwhile , 29 people have been killed by Egyptian security forces since last spring , Mr. Hussein says . Reports of torture have alarmed human-rights organizations like Amnesty International. // ' ' The government ' s policy right now is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ain Shams who asked not to be identified . ' ' They ' re tired of fooling with the courts. ' ' // The situation came to a head three weeks ago , erupting into unprecedented violence in the Egyptian parliament. // Badr - in an apparent bid to discredit his critics - showed a videotape in parliament in which Aiman Nour , a journalist with the New Wafd Party newspaper , ' ' confessed ' ' to doctoring photos of fundamentalists who were allegedly tortured by security officials. // Badr warned that he also had a compromising tape of the leader of the New Wafd Party , which has been campaigning against the interior minister and the emergency law . At that point , a member of the People ' s Assembly tried to attack Badr. // Opposition parties have now united in a call for Badr ' s resignation. // ' ' Badr is blackmailing everyone by saying : ' My rough game is the only way to deal with the fundamentalists . If you want to have your own security , you ' d better leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the left-wing , secular Tegamu Party. // The government ' s troubles with the Ain Shams fundamentalists began last summer when members of the extremist Islamic Jihad took over the Adam mosque and spread out into the community. // They quickly won the community ' s support by setting up a network of local social , welfare , and medical services. // They also organized popular demonstrations against hikes in food prices caused by the government ' s policy of gradually lowering subsidies on basic commodities . There are allegations that they also accosted women in the street , exhorting them to dress according to Islamic values , and harassed members of Egypt ' s Coptic Christian sect. // In August , police entered the mosque and evicted the extremists , clashing with their supporters in street battles that left one civilian dead and scores wounded. // But many non-fundamentalist Muslims say the government ' s policy of repression can not succeed against a movement that feeds on the economic and social discontents bred by Egypt ' s overpopulation , poverty , and unemployment. // ' ' You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Adam Al-Moji , a former fundamentalist . ' ' Once the police cars leave Ain Shams , then things will change back . It ' s like a bomb that ' s timed : it will keep exploding every so often. ' ' // Muslim fundamentalists seek to create an Islamic state governed according to strict interpretation of Islamic law ( sharia ) . Moderates and extremists differ on whether violence should be used to achieve their aims . Extremists are also opposed to Western influences , which they say have corrupted Islamic values. // The actual number of Islamic extremists is small ( government sources estimate about 3 , 000 ) . The government considers them dangerous because they are well organized , highly motivated , and have adopted violence and intimidation to achieve their ends. // ' ' A government crackdown in an area like Ain Shams makes the whole world believe the movement is only there , ' ' says Ashraf Fahmy , a lawyer and spokesman for Muslim fundamentalist groups . ' ' But it ' s everywhere . It ' s in the hearts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another opposition newspaper , reported Badr as saying that after leaving his post as interior minister he would move abroad to be safe from retaliation. // But extremists have also threatened to target President Mubarak himself for failing to implement Islamic law. // ' ' Traditional Muslims believe that the leader of an Islamic nation is apostate only if he denies the need to implement sharia , ' ' explained one source . ' ' But the extremists believe that the leader must implement and enforce Islamic legislation . If not , he has to be removed. ' ' // //
