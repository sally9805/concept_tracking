For better or worse , Jackson brings race to the forefront of the campaign <P> There is the Jesse Jackson that blacks revere . He is the embodiment of black pride , an incandescent force glowing beside dull white politicians , demanding respect and " our fair share . " He is the powerbroker who is ignored or patronized at great risk . <P> There is the Jesse Jackson that many whites distrust and some even fear . He is the former black radical , the civil rights leader who threatened white businessmen with economic boycotts , the presidential candidate who called Jews " Hymie " and New York City " Hymietown . " In his shadow , neither embraced nor disavowed , stands Minister Louis Farrakhan , leader of the Nation of Islam , a Black Muslim sect , who has praised Hitler and seemed to threaten a black reporter with death . <P> In recent weeks , these conflicting perceptions of Jesse Jackson have come to overshadow his remarkable achievements in the Democratic primaries . Almost overnight , he shattered the prevailing wisdom that a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has spurred an unprecedented black voter turnout , outlasted five more politically experienced white rivals , and picked up enough delegates and prestige to play a major role at the Democratic Convention in July .

But the electorate is polarized nevertheless , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white candidates . " A certain latent racism has come out , " says Gary Willis , Henry Luce Professor of American Culture and Public Policy at Northwestern University . " People say , ' Whenever I hear somebody stir up crowds , I think of Hitler . ' That kind of comment shows a blindness to black style , and it 's most often said by people who 've never heard a black church service . " <P> Jackson 's appeals to black pride , almost by definition , are racially charged . In effect , he is asking blacks to vote for him because he is black . The white majority would quickly condemn a white candidate who practiced such overt racial politics . But with blacks , the situation is far more delicate . Sensitive to the victimization of blacks throughout American history , whites tend to be reticent about criticizing them , especially on racial matters .
