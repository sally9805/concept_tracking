 | Between now and Labor Day , millions of Americans will offer up their bodies to the sun 's rays . A luxuriant tan bespeaks health and glamour , and most sun worshipers will sacrifice a lot to achieve it ? including themselves . With each hour , the sun 's ultraviolet radiation produces irreversible damage , hastening the development of unsightly wrinkles . And with each year on the beach or rooftop , the sunbather increases his risk of getting skin cancer . Skin cancer is by far the most common form of cancer . An estimated 400,000 new cases will be detected this year in the United States , and almost all of them can be blamed on overexposure to the sun . Fortunately , most of these cancers are highly curable . But they can be disfiguring and take time to treat . For that reason , sunworshipers should treat their deity with a good deal of awe . The skin consists of two layers , separated by a thin membrane . The deeper layer , or dermis , is made up of blood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follicles and nerve endings . The outer layer , the epidermis , consists of a layer of basal cells that divide and form a top layering of squamous cells . In a continual process , squamous cells die and produce the keratin layer , the outermost protective coating which is ultimately sloughed off as dandruff . The epidermis also contains melanocytes , cells that synthesize melanin pigment when exposed to ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation and produce the much-sought-after tan . Tanning is the skin 's response to UV injury and a way of trying to protect itself from further damage , " says Dr. Mark Greene of the National Cancer Institute . Sunburn , of course , is the initial hazard posed by UV radiation . Prolonged exposure to UV , however , interferes with the production of collagen fibers in the dermis , causing the skin to lose elasticity and creating premature wrinkles . Further deterioration of the dermis deprives the epidermis of nutrition and causes it to become thin and dry . " UV leads to atrophy of the skin , which is another name for aging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institute in Buffalo . Cancer is UV 's final insult . Shortwave radiant energy , especially from the UV-B band , breaks the strands of DNA , the genetic material in the cell nucleus . The DNA strands then rejoin in a haphazard , abnormal fashion . Enzymes work constantly to rearrange the DNA into proper sequence , but with repeated UV exposure , the repair process may eventually break down . Then the mutant DNA may produce a colony of cancer cells . Fever Blisters : Recent research suggests that UV also contributes to a breakdown of the body 's immune system , which , in turn , encourages growth of cancer . Margaret Kripke of the National Cancer Institute has shown that mice exposed to small doses of UV do n't reject transplanted tumors as readily as they normally would . And Dr. John A. Parrish of Boston 's Massachusetts General Hospital has found that UV alters the function of lymphocytes , white blood cells involved in the immune reaction to foreign tissue . A reduced immune response caused by sunlight could prevent the body 's rejection of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why persons infected with herpes-simplex virus develop feverblisters after exposure to intensesunlight . Skin cancer most commonly arises from the basal cells . The nodule usually has a round and shiny or pearly surface with a depressed central crater . It may range from a sixteenth to a half inch in diameter and tend to bleed and crust over . The cancer can easily be confused with other types of skin problems , but Klein advises anyone to see a doctor if a lesion does n't go away within four to six weeks . Possibly because they are attached to the membrane between the dermis and epidermis , basal-cell carcinomas do n't spread to other parts of the body via the blood or lymph system and , therefore , pose the least risk of any form of cancer . Squamous-cell cancers , however , can metastasize . This type of malignancy may be heralded by a precancerous condition called actinic keratosis . These red , beige or brown spots are usually rough and scaly . If detected , they can be easily eradicated by application of a cream containing 5-FU , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a more irregular shape and a greater tendency to bleed than the basal-cell variety . It can spread through the circulatory system , especially if it crops up near the mucous membranes of the lip , ear , eye or nose . Yet it is eminently curable if detected early . The most lethal but rarest of the major skin cancers , malignant melanoma , often stems from a pigmented mole . Although melanoma has been linked to exposure to sunlight , its cause probably involves a number of other factors , including heredity . Danger Spots : Basal and squamous-cell carcinomas are cut out , burned away with an electric needle or frozen by cryosurgery . Careful slicing of the removed tissue and examination under a microscope tells the surgeon whether he has destroyed all the malignant tissue . Malignant melanoma can also be cured by surgery if caught before the tumor has burrowed too deeply and spread . But skin cancer may be avoided with a good dose of common sense . People with fair skin and blue eyes who burn easily stand the highest risk . Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to the sun , such as the cheeks , nose , lower lip and the ears . People who have already developed precancerous lesions or had one skin-cancer growth stand a greatly increased chance of developing others . Dermatologists recommend avoiding the sun when it 's most intense ? between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m . Anyone who insists on sunbathing should use a good sun screen . These lotions and salves contain chemicals , such as para-aminobenzoic acid , that block out the burning UV-B radiation while permitting the tanning rays to reach the skin . They come in a range of strengths , tailored to the individual 's complexion and susceptibility to burning . One final warning : exposure to sunlight has a cumulative effect . In other words , the risk of cancer does n't go back to zero with the fading of each summer 's tan . It increases , year after year . " The clock is ticking , " says Klein , " from your first exposure to the sun . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
