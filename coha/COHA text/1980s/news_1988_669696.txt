Mr. Ford likes the home-cooked food and the friendly atmosphere at the small eatery . But even more - he likes the price . At Atlanta ' s Cafe 458 , probably the first restaurant for homeless in the country , all of the meals are free. // But the cafe is not just another soup kitchen doling out free meals . At 458 , the guests , as the staff prefers to call the patrons , sit in a sunny dining room filled with Formica tables topped with fresh flowers , and they eat off real plates . They order from a daily menu that always includes a choice of two entrees , rolls , two vegetables , two desserts , and coffee , tea , or lemonade . ( Ford could choose fried chicken or spaghetti , carrots or greens , and cheesecake or peach cobbler. ) // // Situated in a historic area of downtown Atlanta , near the Martin Luther King Center , the brightly painted building has been serving a small number of the city ' s homeless since it opened last June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 people a hot , full-course lunch. // Like Ford , a disabled truck driver , some of the homeless have been coming to the restaurant since it opened . They feel at home and greet the staff and some of the other diners by their first names. // ' ' We ' re serving more than food here , ' ' says the Rev. A.B. Short , one of the founders . ' ' We ' re serving friendship , hospitality , and brotherhood . Once people come together for a meal and sit across the table from one another at eye level , walls break down. ' ' // Carol Bogrett , a single parent with two school-age daughters , says , ' ' Oftentimes , people who are homeless , even if it ' s just temporarily , are treated in a dehumanizing way , but here the staff treats everyone with courtesy and respect. ' ' // Guests get reservations from local shelters , the nearby labor pool , and other social agencies that serve the homeless . To encourage interaction and long-term relationships with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-week period and may be renewed. // Atlanta , like other cities across the country , has several soup kitchens and shelters that feed the homeless . But many people , especially women with children and the elderly , are frightened or intimidated in soup kitchens , since they usually serve several hundred people each day. // Bobby Harris cites a major difference between soup kitchens and Cafe 458 : ' ' You have to push and shove when you eat in a soup kitchen . People are jumping in front of you - coming in half drunk . But here the cafe has a nice atmosphere , and ( the staff and volunteers ) are helping a lot of people who really need help. ' ' // Mr. Short , a longtime activist for the homeless , explains the philosophy behind the restaurant : ' ' We believe people can make some changes in their lives when they ' re in a supportive community . We ' re trying to establish a relationship with people in transition , see what they want to do next and what ' s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York project director for the National Coalition for Homeless , a federation of advocacy groups for the homeless , says , ' ' Cafe 458 addresses more than the physical needs of the homeless . It ' s an innovative program that is trying to provide some support for homeless and bring them back into the mainstream. ' ' // The cafe , which is simply named for its street address , is operated by the Community of Hospitality , a nonprofit religious group that also operates a small shelter for men . The cafe is staffed with volunteers , some of whom serve on the small board of advisers . The board also includes the director of the city ' s food bank and one of his division coordinators , a lawyer with the Atlanta Criminal Defense and Justice Project , and two local businessmen. // A nonprofit organization , the cafe operates with an annual budget of $36 , 000 , most of which comes from private donations and local contributions . Since all of the 30 to 40 workers are rotating volunteers , the biggest item on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill is another major cost. // MOST of the food comes from the Atlanta Food Bank and the Atlanta Table , a division of the Food Bank that collects surplus food from local restaurants , hotels , and hospitals and delivers it to the cafe . But Laurie Findlay , the volunteer kitchen coordinator who also plans the menus , must buy some meat and staples each week. // Short began working on a cafe about two years ago after he talked with Robert Freeman , the chairman of the Atlanta Community Food Bank ' s board of directors . Mr. Freeman , a recently retired businessman who had volunteered to help work in a local soup kitchen , was disappointed by the lack of interaction between the soup kitchen staff and clients . ' ' While large-scale feeding programs are necessary in most cities , eating in a soup kitchen is somewhat dehumanizing , ' ' he says. // Freeman and Short discussed the possibility of opening a small restaurant where homeless people could have a meal with dignity rather than feeling just like a number . ' ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives and give them some options , ' ' Short says , ' ' even if it ' s something as small as choosing what they ' ll eat or drink or complaining about the food. ' ' // Several churches and individuals involved in local programs for the homeless responded to Short ' s and Freeman ' s requests for aid and donations . After almost a year ' s search , an abandoned building was selected as the site because , it was close to several of the city ' s shelters as well as medical facilities and easily accessible by MARTA , the city ' s transit system. // With the help of several local businesses and a state grant , Short purchased the building for $60 , 000 . Short notes , ' ' Even though the building was useless , we had to pay top dollar for it because the land is so valuable . In the next few years , the whole area around the MLK Center and Auburn Avenue will be restored with federal funds. ' ' // The building , a one-time drive-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Change , had been vacant for almost 20 years . The interior , filled with broken glass and debris , was completely gutted . The exterior concrete was covered with mold. // Short , along with volunteers and local contractors , immediately began cleaning up the area . A businessman donated a dump truck , and volunteers carted away more than half a dozen loads of rubble and junk. // LOCAL contractors and union members donated services and materials , replacing all of the plumbing , electricity , and heating and cooling systems . A restaurant chain designed the kitchen area and donated equipment . The renovations , which took more than eight months to complete , had to meet both the city codes and guidelines for the restoration of historic properties. // Volunteers from local churches , along with some of the homeless , hung sheet rock and painted the cafe both inside and out . They hung pink curtains on the windows and placed flowers on each table . The city of Atlanta donated tubs of red and white geraniums to line the entrance ramp . The cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several cities considering opening restaurants for the homeless. // In keeping with the mission statement of the cafe , Short and the volunteer staff are working toward making the cozy cafe a small community center for the homeless . Guests already have access to legal services , which are now housed in the front of the building , and a mobile medical facility that visits the cafe twice a month . Alcoholics Anonymous meets in here once a week , and plans are under way to begin placing some of the homeless in job programs through another nonprofit group. // Short , however , wants to focus on the quality of the program . ' ' We ' re not an assembly line , ' ' he says . ' ' There are only so many people you can know and develop a meaningful relationship with. ' ' // While he ' d like to expand the variety of the services offered , he doesn ' t want to expand the number the cafe serves , because of the personalized nature of the program . ' ' We know we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are helping a small number of people take another step. ' ' // //
