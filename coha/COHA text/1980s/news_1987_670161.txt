Computer Sciences Corp. said it formally protested a California Department of Health Services decision to award a $122 million contract to a competitor because of concerns about Computer Sciences ' " tenacity and perseverance " and ability to perform . Earlier this month , the department indicated that it would give the five-year contract for processing Medi-Cal claims to General Motors Corp. ' s Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit , even though the EDS bid was $2 million higher than that of Computer Sciences . EDS also scored lower than Computer Sciences in a bidding evaluation by state evaluators , a department spokesman said . Medi-Cal is California ' s version of the health services program for the poor known nationwide as Medicaid . Acting as a lobbyist for EDS in the contract bidding was David Swoap , who served from 1983 to 1985 as secretary of the state ' s Health &; Welfare Agency , which oversees the Department of Health Services . Mr. Swoap said his San Francisco-based government relations firm represents EDS on a number of issues . In Dallas , a spokesman for EDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenstein , project manager for the state ' s Medi-Cal Procurement Project , said officials determined that Computer Sciences " wasn ' t a responsible bidder , " based on the price structure of its bid and " performance problems we ' ve had in the past with them . " The computer services concern , based in El Segundo , Calif. , has processed MediCal insurance claims for the state since 1978 and remains under contract until next September . Mr. Rosenstein said the company ' s performance problems have included delays in processing claims and paying medical providers . Computer Sciences also has been " consistently late " in providing certain quality control products , he said , resulting in some incorrect payments to providers and incorrect reporting to the state . And the company has failed to set up sufficient toll-free telephone lines to handle inquiries from providers , he added . A Computer Sciences executive , however , said the state hadn ' t previously complained about its performance and had encouraged the company to bid on the new contract . Arthur B. Sims , a Computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake " in passing over his company for the contract . " They ' re attempting to justify it by using this nonperformance issue as a screen , " he said . Mr. Sims acknowleged that the company " has made minor mistakes " in its nine years of work for the state , but said Computer Sciences " has consistently delivered a high level of service . " Computer Sciences , with revenue of $1. 03 billion in fiscal 1987 ended April 3 , holds a large number of federal information technology services contracts and serves as fiscal intermediary for New York state ' s Medicaid program . In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Computer Sciences shares fell 87. 5 cents , to close at $54. 25 . The final California contract won ' t be awarded until the state Department of General Services hears Computer Sciences ' protest . That process could take as long as 60 days , the company said . A GTE Corp. unit that also bid on the contract hasn ' t filed a protest with the Department of General Services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Conn. , telecommunications company , couldn ' t be reached for comment late yesterday .
