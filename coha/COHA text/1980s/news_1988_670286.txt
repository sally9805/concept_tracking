Ulan Bator , Mongolia  --  Between the eye and the bare horizon stretched a vast , faintly undulating plane , fawn-pink at its farthest edge , turning to dry sienna and then a foreground of velvety whitish green set with long , thin lakes of indigo , which were the shadows of the clouds . The battered old aircraft ' s propellers wheezed and rang as it bounced to a halt on a trackless surface of soft crust . We climbed out onto the Gobi Desert and huddled together in the hot wind , a score of American tourists gazing stolidly at the distant cluster of white-felt Mongol tents , called yurts , where we were to stay . We had come all the way from Irkutsk in Siberia , first by train , the old eastern Chinese Railway that splits southeast from the main line and leads to Beijing . That was 700 miles and then there were 500 more via Air Mongolia ( which for good reason isn ' t yet in the airline guides ) , before we landed at random on a surface strewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less a desert in the classic sense of sand dunes and more a region of extreme aridity lying 1 , 500 miles across southern Mongolia and Inner Mongolia , which is now part of China . It is considered to be among the more remote places in the world ; that may no longer be saying much . But as a strong , dry wind began to push us toward the yurts , which with a row of poplars , a washhouse and a kitchen barrack made up the little oasis , it was far enough . For some Americans , the Gobi belongs to Roy Chapman Andrews , one of those momentary celebrities thrown up by easily comprehended scientific achievement . Mr. Andrews put the Gobi on the map for the Western public in the 1920s and ' 30s , exploring it , sharing its hardship with the nomads and shooting its game . But most important , he came across  --  not far from here as it turned out  --  several clutches of dinosaur eggs , some of them containing whole if petrified embryos . The dinosaur ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large or menacing ; it was about the size of a medium crocodile and only a vegetarian . But although the dinosaurs were reptiles and therefore came out of eggs , no such eggs had ever been found before , or at least recorded as having been found , by man . This discovery caused a great sensation and Mr. Andrews became famous . He substantiated his fame by a series of books on Mongolia in which he presents himself as a forceful and enterprising character whose robust bravery and verbal flourishes recall Teddy Roosevelt . His books are still the best reading on the land and its friendly , prickly people with whom , like many explorers of his forthright type , he was on the best of terms . Mr. Andrews ate rancid mutton fat and drank mare ' s milk in the Gobi with the best and worst of them . We encountered none of the tawny Mongolian gazelles , nor the sheldrake nor the sand grouse that Mr. Andrews bagged , but we saw the two-humped camels that formed the caravans familiar to Marco Polo and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . We also saw , as our stubby bus wheezed up the foothills of the Altai chain , the little long-maned Mongolian horses whose predecessors carried the soldiers of Genghis Khan thousands of miles to the west . But in the gorgelike valley where the lemon-yellow steppe poppy bloomed and whose floor was threaded by an ice-encrusted stream , I did see , above the highest escarpments one of the rarities of Mongolia , the great bearded vulture or lammergeier , second only to the condor in wing span and now confined to the alpine fastnesses of Spain , Greece , the Caucasus and central Asia . The bird came sailing across and far above a red escarpment on its black jointed wings , its head and belly pale gold , wheeling slowly in the sun to fall back after a moment behind the rocky rim and disappear . The lammergeier is a legendary creature , partly because of its extreme isolation ( it nests only on the highest and remotest cliffs ) and partly because of its feeding habits , which include dropping the bones of its prey onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestible size . Like all deserts , the Gobi is a no man ' s land and across its wastes now came an intersecting caravan  --  another , considerably smaller , group of tourists who had made their way up from Bukhara and Samarkand , the mysterious cities of Central Asia , crossing Mongolia on their way to China . This new procession included a distinguished woman in late middle age , impeccably dressed with upswept hair and a gold-tipped walking stick . She came from New York and , accompanied by a fashionable and solicitous daughter , was on her return journey across half the world . A third figure was a man in a tweed jacket who had brought along a harmonica . Together they sat after dinner in a little fretwork pavilion , talking softly as the yellow moon rose behind the washhouse . Then we heard the faint , reedy music of the mouth organ drifting on the breeze toward the yurts . It was hard to make out  --  " Beautiful Dreamer , " wasn ' t it ? or " My Old Kentucky Home " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Press Center in New York.
