S T O R Y JUM P By Nadine Gordimer e is aware of himself H in the room , behind the apartment door , at the end of a corridor , within the spaces of this destination that has the name HOTEL LEBUVU in gilt mosaic where he was brought in . The vast lobby where a plastic-upholstered sofa and matching easy chairs are stranded , the waiting elevator in its shaft that goes up floor after floor past empty halls , gleaming signs  --  CONFERENCE CENTER , TROPICANA BUFFET , THE MERMAID BAR  --  he is aware of being finally reached within all this as , in a film , a series of dissolves passes the camera through walls to find a single figure , the hero , the criminal . Himself . The curtains are open upon the dark , at night . When he gets up in the morning he closes them . By now they are on fire with the sun , The day pressing to enter . But his back is turned ; he is an echo in the chamber of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television set they must have installed when they decided where to put him . There is nothing to match its expensive finish  --  the small deal table and four chairs with hard , red , plastic-covered seats , the hairy two-division sofa , the Formica-topped stool , the burning curtains whose circles and blotches of pattern dazzle like the flicker of flames ; These would he standard for a clientele of transients who spend a night , spill beer , and Nadine G ( inhaler ' s most recent book is The Fcsential Gesture , a collection of essays .

The silvery convex of the screen reflects a dim , ballooned vision of a face , pale and full . He forgets , and passes a hand over cheek and chin , but there is no beard there  --  it 's real that he shaved it off . And they gave him money to fit himself out with the clothes he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unlike the fine hair of his head ) , the camouflage fatigues tucked into boots that struck authoritatively with each step , the leather-bound beret ; took them all off , divested himself of them . There ! He must be believed , he was believed . The face pale and sloping away into the pale flesh of the chin : his hidden self produced for them . It 's there on the dead screen when he looks up . A child he remembers  --  himself ? ? had a dog who , when it was caught and bathed , emerged trembling , ashamed , revealed by the wet fur plastered to its frame to be other than it had appeared in its luxuriant coat . They supplied a cassette player of good quality as well as a wide-screen television set . He is playing , so loudly it fills the room , pressing counter to the day pressing against the curtains , the music track from a film about an American soldier who becomes brutalized by the atrocities he is forced to commit in Vietnam . He saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does not visualize its images . He is not listening ; The swell and clash , the tympany of conflict , the brass of glory , the chords of thrilling resolve , the maudlin strings of regret , the pauses of disgust  --  they come from inside him . They flow from him and he sits on and does not meet the STORY 55 CpUa17CI . A 1.11JUJC dILL1 d l.d/ . L.vcimurmy some sort of decent position . Rehabilitated . He had thought of information , public relations ( with his international experience ) ; it was too soon to say , but they did n't say no . Everything he wanted : That was to be his reward . The television crews came  --  not merely the tin-pot African ones but the BBC , CBS , Zweites Deutsches Femsehen and the foreign correspondents flew in with their rape recorders . He was produced at press conferences in the company of the Commander of the Armed Forces , the Minister of Defense , and their aides , elegant as the overthrown colonial ones had been . A flower arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , his thighs , which had been imposing in fatigues , too fleshy when crossed in slightly shiny tropical trousers , his chin white , soft and naked where the beard was gone , his hair barbered neat and flat with the dun fringe above the forehead , clippers run up the nape  --  on his big , hunched body he saw , in the newspaper photographs , the head of a little boy with round bewildered eyes under brows drawn together and raised . He told his story . For the first few months he told his story again and again , in performance . Everyone has heard it , now . On the table with the four chairs drawn up , a cold fried egg waits on a plate covered by another plate . A jug of hot water has grown tepid beside a tin of instant coffee . Someone has brought these things and gone away . Everyone has gone away . The soaring , billowing music in the room is the accompaniment the performance never had . When the tape has ended he depresses the rewind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house or the car , and he does n't know how to bring this up  --  they hardly ever come to see him anymore , but maybe that 's natural because the debriefing is over , they 're satisfied . There 's nothing more to tell the television crews and the press . There 's nothing more he can think of think back ! think back ! ? to find to say . They 've heard about his childhood in this capital , this country to which he has been returned . That he was an ordinary colonial child of parents who 'd come out from Europe to find a better life where it was warm and there were opportunities . That it was warm and there was the sea and tropical fruit , blacks to dig and haul , but the opportunity was nothing grander than the assured tenure of a white man in the lower ranks of the civil service . His parents were not interested in politics , never . They were not interested in the blacks . They did n't think the blacks would ever affect their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in the North ; troops came from the " mother " country to deal with it . The boy would perhaps become an accountant , certainly something one rung above his father , because each generation must better itself , as they had done by emigrating . He grew up taking for granted the activities and the outlets for adventurous play that had no place in the reality of the blacks ' lives , the blacks ' war : As an adolescent he bonded with his peers through joining the parachute club , and he jumped  --  the rite of passage into manhood . In the capital , the revolution was achieved overnight by Europe 's decision to relinquish power , exacted by the indigenous people through years of war in the rural areas . A few statues toppled in the capital 's square , and some shops were looted in revenge for exploitation . His parents judged their security by the uninterrupted continuance , at first , of the things that mattered to them : The garbage continued to be collected twice a week , and there was fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be touched by black rule . He was apprenticed as draftsman to an architect by then ( it was more prestigious than accountancy ) , and his weekend hobby , in addition to jumping from the sky , was photography . He even made a bit of pocket money by selling amusing shots of animals and birds to a local paper . Then came the event that  --  all at once , reeled up as the tape is filling its left cylinder on rewind  --  the experience that explained everything he had ever done since , everything that he was to confess to , everything he was to inculpate himself for and judge himself on in his performance for the journalists under the monitoring approval of the Commander of the Armed Forces and the Minister of Defense , during the probing of debriefing , the Q and A interviews ; and also , now , to himself , in fiery dimness behind the curtains ' embers , facing the fisheye of the TV screen , surrounded by the music , alone . He had taken a photograph of a seabird alighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine guns seized him , smashed his camera , and took him to the police . He was detained for five weeks in a dirty cell the colonial regime had used for blacks . His parents were told he was an imperialist spy  --  their innocent boy , only two years out of school ! Of course , this was all in the confusion of the first days of freedom ( he would explain to his audience ) , it was to be expected . And who was that boy to think he could photograph anything he liked , a military installation of interest to the new State 's enemies ? That white boy . At this point in the telling came the confession that for the first time in his life he thought about blacks  --  and hated them . They had smashed his camera and locked him up like a black , and he hated them and their government and everything they might do , whether it was good or bad . No  --  he had not then believed they could ever do anything good for the country where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sought out  --  he was never made to be clear on this small point  --  white people to whom his parents had successfully appealed to get him released . They soothed him with their indignation over what had happened to him and gave him a substitute for the comradeship of the parachute club ( closed down by the blacks ' military security ) in their secret organization to restore white rule through compliant black proxies . How it was to be done was not yet formulated , allies from neighboring cold and hot wars had not yet been found , money from international interests wanting access to oil and mineral finds had not been supplied , sources for materiel and mercenaries to put together a rebel army in the bush were still to be investigated . He bent quietly over his drawing board , and at night he went to clandestine meetings . He felt importantly patriotic ; something new , because his parents had abandoned the country of their birth , and this country in which he was horn had been taken back by the blacks for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white like them but well-off and knowledgeable about how to go on living here where it was warm , trusted to advise one if it were to be time to leave . They were proud when told their son was being sent to Europe to study ; an act of philanthropy by compatriots of the country they had all once emigrated from . Of humble beginnings , he had come into the patrimony of counterrevolution. he telephone is not only good for house calls that summon the old black man shrunken in khaki who brings the beer , brought the egg , and covered it with a second plate . He can phone long-distance every day , if he wants to . There is never a bill ; they pay . That was the condition understood  --  they would provide everything . So he phones his mother every third day in the European city to which she and his father returned when the people who knew about these things said it was time to go . He has only to dial , and it 's winter there now and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room behind double-glazing , discovered by him ( so that was where his parents came from ! ) when he was set up in the same European city . They must have realized soon that he was not studying . At least not in the sense they would understand , of attending an institute and qualifying for a profession you could name . But it was obvious to them he was doing well , he was highly thought of by the people who had recognized the young man 's qualities and taken him up after the terrible time when those blacks threw him in prison back where everything was lost , now  --  the civil servant 's pension , the mangoes and passion fruit , the sun . He was involved in the affairs of those people of substance , international business too complicated for him to explain . And confidential . They respected that . A mother and father must never make any move that might jeopardize the opportunities they themselves have not been able to provide . He was always on his way to or from the airport  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not specify . Of course his gift for languages must have been invaluable to the people he worked with rather than for  --  that was clearly his status . He had not an apartment but a whole house purchased for him in the privacy of one of the best quarters , and his study or office there was not only lined with documents and books but equipped with the latest forms of telecommunication . Foreign associates came to stay ; he had a full-time maid . His delicate , adolescent 's chin disappeared in the soft flesh of good living , and then he grew the beard that came out dark and vigorous , giving him the aspect of a man of power . They never saw him wearing the rest of its attributes : the bulky fatigues and the hoots and the beret . He visited them in civilian clothes that had come to be his disguise . The first time he ever used the phone on the floor was when he phoned her , his mother , to tell her he was alive and here . Where ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in this country ! The sun , the mangoes ( that day there was fruit supplied on the table where the egg now congeals ) , the prison a young boy had been thrown into like any black . She wept because she and his father had thought he was dead . He had disappeared two months previously . Without a word ; that was one of the conditions he adhered to on his side , he could n't tell his parents this was not a business trip from which he would return : He was giving up the house , the maid , the first-class air tickets , the important visitors , the book-lined room with the telecommunications system by which was planned the blowing up of trains , the mining of roads , and the massacre of sleeping villagers back there where he was born . It is the day to phone her . It 's more and more difficult to keep up the obligation . There 's nothing left to tell her , either . From weeping gratitude that he was alive , as time has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished in this way , why he should have got mixed up in something that had ended so badly . Over the phone she says , Are you all right ? He asks after his father 's health . Does it look like being a mild winter ? Already the wind from the mountains has brought a touch of rheumatism . Do you need anything ? ( Money is provided for him to send to his parents , deprived of their pension ; that 's part of the deal . ) Then there 's nothing to say . She does n't ask if he 's suffering from the heat back there , although the sun banks up its fire in the dosed curtains , although she knows well enough what the climate 's like in summer , and he was gone seven years and can not reacclimatize . She does n't want to mention the heat because that is to admit he is back there . She and his father will never understand what it was all about , his life ; why he got himself into the fine house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave it all up . She says little , in a listless voice , over the phone . But she writes . They deliver her letters , pushed under the door : Why does God punish me ? What have your father and I done ? It all started long ago . We were too soft with you . With that parachute nonsense . We should never have allowed it . Giving in , letting you run wild with those boys . It started to go wrong then . we should have seen you were going to make a mess of our lives , I do n't know why . You had to go jumping from up there . Do you know what I felt , seeing you fall like that , enjoying yourself , frightening us to death while you fooled around with killing yourself ? We should have known it . Where it would end . Why did you have to be like that ? Why ? Why ? First in the weeks of debriefing and then in murderous horde that burns down hospitals , cuts off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers going home to their huts , rapes children , and forces women at gunpoint to kill their husbands and eat their flesh ? He sat there before them sane , and was confronted by the madness . As he sits in the red gloom in front of the wide-screen television set , the fuse of a cigarette between the fingers of his fine white hand and his pale blue eyes clear under puppylike brows . Shuddering ; they could n't see it but he shuddered within every time to hear listed by them what he knew had happened . How could they come out with it , just like that ? Because honor comes slowly . It takes weeks and months , trickling , growing , mounting , rolling , swelling from the faxed codes of operation , the triumph of arms deals secretly concluded with countries who publicly condemn such transactions ; from the word destabilization , with its image of some faulty piece of equipment to be rocked from its base so that a sound structure may be put in its place . He sent the fax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies interested in access to the oil and minerals the blacks were giving to their rivals , he canvassed Foreign Offices interested in that other term , spheres of influence . In the fine house where an antique clock played an air over the sudden stuttering of communications installations , the war was intelligence , the miracle of receiving the voice of a general thousands of kilometers away , on the other continent , down there in the bush . When he traveled on his missions in Europe he himself was that fighting man : the beard , the fatigues , the beret . The people he visited saw him as straight from the universal battlefield of right and left ; the accoutrements transformed him for himself , so it seemed he had just emerged from that generic destiny known as the field of operations . You mean to say you did n't know ? But nobody talked . A push was achieved or it was n't . A miniature flag moved on the map . Men lost , and losses imposed on the government forces were recorded . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the neighboring African State allied in the cause of destabilization was successful ; the rebel force would fight on for years , village by village , bridge by bridge , power stations and strategic roads gained on the map . There would be victory on the righteous side . Nobody said how it was being done . The black government spread reports of massacres because it was losing , and of course the leftist and liberal press took up the tales . Intelligence , tuned to the clock with its gilded cupids , filed these under disinformation about destabilization . Here , always , they waited for him to go on . He swallowed continually between phrases , and while he was telling they would watch him swallow . The cold egg wo n't go down . There is a thin streamer of minute ants who come up six floors through the empty foyer and the closed reception rooms and find their way along the leg of the table to food left there ; he knows . And telling , telling  --  telling over and over to himself , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the ants come steadily . Go on , go on . It was n't until I went to the neighboring State that provided the materiel , planes , intelligence supplied by its agents  --  it is a white state and very advanced  --  to the communications center it set up for us in the house in Europe . There was also a base . Go on . A training base for our people . It was secret , no one knew it was there . Hidden in a game reserve . 1 was very confident pleased  --  to find myself not only sent around Europe but chosen to go to that State . To liaise . To meet the Commander of National Security and Special Services there . See for myself the important extent of cooperation in our mutual dedication to the cause . Report back on the morale of our men being trained there in the use of advanced weapons and strategy . Yes ? A crescendo comes in great waves from the speaker provided with the tape player : to win the war , stabilize by destabilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! During press conferences , at this point an ooze of heat would rise under his skin . Their eyes on him drew it up from his tissues like a blister . And then ? There 's no one in the room , the curtains are closed against everyone . Swallow . I saw the male refugees captured at the border brought in starving . I saw how to deal with them . They were made to join our forces or were put back over the border to die . I could see that they would die . Their villages burned , their families hacked to death  --  you saw in their faces and bodies how it really happened ... the disinformation . It was n't talked about at that base , either . Our allies , at the dinners they gave ? game dishes and wine , everything of the best provided , treated like a VIP  --  they did n't talk about these things . Well ... I was shown around . . . everything . The secret radio station that broadcast the Voice of our organization . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms made in their factories . ( That outfit of mine must have come from there . ) The planes taking off at night to fly our men , armed and equipped to do what they were trained to do . I knew , now , what that was . Yes ? Of course , it was war .. . So ? . War is n't pretty . There is brutality on both sides . I had to understand . Tried to . But planes also came back from over the border at night . Not empty . They carried what I thought were refugee children to be saved from the fighting ; girls of twelve or thirteen , terrified , they had to be pulled apart from each other to get them to walk . They were brought in for the men who were receiving their military training . Men who had been without women ; to satisfy them . After dinner , the Commander offered me one . He had one led in for himself . He took off her clothes to show me . So , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that our army had become  --  maybe always was  --  yes , what you say , a murderous horde that burned hospitals , cut off the ears of villagers , raped , blew up trains full of workers . Brought to devastation this country where I was born . It 's there , only the glowing curtains keep it out . At night , when the curtains are drawn back , it is still there in the dark with the blind bulk of buildings , the traces of broken boulevards and decayed squares marked in feeble lights . Familiar to me , ca n't say I do n't know it , ca n't say it does n't recognize me . It is there , with the sun pressing against the window , a population become beggars living in the streets , camping out in what used to be our  --  white people 's  --  apartments , no electricity , no water in the tiled bathrooms , no glass in the windows , and on the fine balconies facing the sea where we used to take our aperitifs , those little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's the end . But it 's gone over again and again . No end . les only the tape that ends . Ca n't be explained how someone begins really to know . Instead of having intelligence by fax and satellite . Back in the room in Europe with its tele-cret bases . Everything . Everything he was and had been , right back to the jump with the parachute and the photograph of the tower . They did n't shoot . They kept him under guard so that the people from the telecommunications headquarters in the room with the antique clock would nor kill him before he could tell . They handled him carefully ; himself a strange and rare species , kept captured for study . They were aware of its worth , to them . Debriefing is like destabilization : The term does n't describe the method and experience . Day by day , divested of the boots , fatigues , the beret and beard , first-class flights , the house in Europe , the dinners of honor , the prestige of intelligence  --  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting quite still on a chair in a dark room , only a naked full neck pulsating . In the silence after the tape ends it is possible to think there is the distinct sound of ants moving in an unwavering path . They knew they could n't have it for nothing  --  his life . They have n't provided the house with a garden that was part of the deal . Or the car . Of course , he can go out . Go where he likes ; it was only for the first six months that he was restricted . Once they know they can trust him , he 's not of interest to them any longer . Nothing more , now , to lead them to . Once he 's told everything , once he 's been displayed , what use is he to them ? They are right . Perhaps they will the yellow mound of the yolk with her forefinger ; the congealed surface dents shindy . She wipes her finger on the T-shirt that is her nightgown . A sprig of houseplant she brought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table where she set it down then ; in the cloudy water , the darkened room , it has sent out one frail , floating thread of root . Ants are wavering at the rim of the glass . The thin buttermilk smell of her fluids and his semen comes to him as she bends to follow the ants ' trail from the floor . After he had finished with her , last night , she said : You do n't love me . He was assailed by the sight of the twelveyear-old child and the Commander . Then she heard something she could n't believe . The man weeping . She drew away in fear and repugnance to the side of the bed . She hangs about the room behind him , this morning , knowing he 's not going to speak . Why do n't we go to the beach . Let 's have a swim . I 'd love to go and eat some prawns . We can take a bus . There 's a good place ... it 's cheap . And do n't you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water ... come on . She waits patiently . Has he shaken his head ? There was some slight movement . There is nothing in the room she can turn to as a pretext to keep her there , waiting to see if he accepts her forgiveness , her humble understanding of her function . After a few minutes she goes back into the bedroom and comes out dressed . I 'm going . Qualifies : Going for a swim . This time he nods and leans to take a cigarette . She has n't opened the door yet . She 's hesitating , as if she thinks she ought to make some gesture , does n't know what , might go over and touch his hair . She 's gone . After the inhalation of the cigarette has become his breath and body , he gets up and goes to the window . He pulls aside the curtains to left and right . They are parched and faded , burned out . And now he is exposed : There is the bright stare of the beggared city , city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old men propped against empty facades to die , the orphaned children running in packs round the rubbish dumps , the men without ears and women with a stump where there was an arm , their clamor rising at him , rising six floors in the sun . He ca n't go out because they are all around him , the people . Jump . The stunning blow of the earth as it came up to flexed knees , the parachute sinking silken . He stands , and then backs into the room . Not now ; not yet . ?
