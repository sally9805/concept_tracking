Dark and stormy starts <P> <P> " Call me Ishmael " ? No , far too good . " It was the best of times , it was the worst of times . . . " ? A beauty , a classic-but all wrong for the Second Annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest , which asks contestants to try their hand at composing truly atrocious opening sentences to hypothetical bad novels . Says San Jose State University English Professor Scott Rice : " We want the kind of writing that makes the reader say , ' Do n't go on . ' " <P> Founded by Rice , who has enlisted the assistance of fellow professors to judge the entries ( some 700 so far ) , the contest was named in dishonor of poor Edward G.E.L . Bulwer-Lytton . A popular and workmanlike 19th century British novelist , Bulwer-Lytton wrote a book , Paul Clifford , that unfortunately began , " It was a dark and stormy night . . . " Among the exquisitely bad sentences sent to the California ( zip code : 95192 ) judges : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug dealer , bleeding like a side of beef in an abattoir , the Chinese sailor croaked out one word : ' Firelight ' ( a code word ? or a dying man 's resurrection of a beloved childhood memory ? ) and fell to the ground , sprawled out like an epileptic lobster , clutching in his fist loosened by the merciful kiss of death fire of another sort : a 20-carat , flawless blue diamond .

" <P> The contest , Rice says , is a perverse but true test of talent : " You have to know what is good before you can write something truly awful . " Why would anyone vie for the Bulwer-Lytton prize ? Jokes Rice : " They want the chance to become a household name . " Contest deadline : April 15.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
