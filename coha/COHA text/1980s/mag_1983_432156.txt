 | The slender ribbon of sand that trims much of the nation 's coastline is rapidly growing narrower . Scientists warn that natural and manmade forces ? accelerated this year by a siege of devastating storms ? are eroding America 's beaches at an alarming rate . At the same time , the sea level is rising as the pollutants of an industrial society slowly warm the earth 's climate and melt polar ice . " Our coasts are more endangered now than ever before , " says Douglas Inman , director of the Center for Coastal Studies at the Scripps Oceanographic Institute in La Jolla , Calif . Some of the most recent results in man 's losing battle with the sea : Famed Mission Beach near San Diego ? much of its sand claimed by late-winter storms ? has a new nickname : " Missing Beach . " A beach at Waveland , Miss. , on the Gulf of Mexico , was washed away last winter only weeks after it had been rebuilt for the third time . Erosion has so devastated the shoreline near one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development steer prospects away from the ocean view until low tide because there is virtually no beach at high tide . The erosion problem is getting worse , experts say , because of human interference with nature 's process of continuously destroying old beaches while creating new ones . Recent evidence indicates that sea walls and other barriers intended to check erosion may actually accelerate the process . Scientists are learning that jetties , floating breakwaters and wire baskets filled with rocks can cause the waves to undermine beaches faster , thus creating a need for more structures . At the same time , replacement sand that normally would be borne to the sea by rivers is being choked off by dams built upstream . How swiftly are the nation 's coasts eroding ? The Atlantic side is losing an average of 3 feet of beach a year . The loss on the Gulf Coast is estimated at 7 feet annually , and the scenic Pacific shoreline is vanishing at an astonishing 10 feet a year . The future looks even bleaker . Scientists report that carbon dioxide spewed from industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's atmosphere and melting polar ice . Unless something is done , they say , the sea level at high tide could rise 3 feet and move 3,000 feet inland over the next 100 years ? enough to flood many of the nation 's largest cities . Rude awakening . Scientists ' warnings about erosion went largely unnoticed by the public until vicious storms last winter literally wiped out huge sections of beaches . Some of the most dramatic damage occurred on the 1,100-mile-long California coast , where state geologists report stretches of beach totaling 120 miles are eroding critically . A late January storm caused 200 million dollars in damage to homes and businesses from mud slides , flooding and erosion . Before residents could fully dig out , a second round of storms slammed into the coast in March . Hardest hit was the Monterey Bay region of Santa Cruz County on the central coast of the state . At the Pajaro  | condominium development in Watsonville , 40 feet of beach was sucked away . In San Francisco , the storms uncovered sea walls , stairways and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand at Ocean Beach . Near Los Angeles , the city of Oceanside lost 1 million cubic yards of beach sand that had been trucked in from nearby valleys just four months earlier at a cost of 3.5 million dollars . In Malibu , homes perched precariously on cliffs crashed into the sea . The storms also wreaked havoc farther north along the Pacific coast , worsening an already serious erosion problem . Western Washington University geographer Thomas Terich claims that the worst erosion problem in the nation is at Cape Shoalwater , Wash. , where the sea gouges the shoreline away in 150-foot chunks each year . A 75-year-old cemetery near there was moved a mile inland in 1976 to escape the pounding Pacific . " I go up there every six months to take pictures , and each time I return , the area looks completely different , " says Terich . Communities along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts also are assessing their losses . Storms last winter set waves to lapping underneath Atlantic City 's famous boardwalk , threatening phone lines and sewers . A town on North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year to erosion . The surf has crept 2,500 feet closer to the famous lighthouse at Cape Hatteras , N.C. , in the last century . South Carolina 's Cape Island is moving 10 to 15 feet a year . Migrating as though on a tank tread , sand is diminishing on the island 's ocean side and being built up on the mainland side . Louisiana is yielding land to the Gulf of Mexico so fast in certain areas that officials worry about 300 million dollars a year in state oil royalties . If the drift continues , some offshore oil rigs will be outside the 3-mile limit of state waters before long . Orrin Pilkey , a geology professor at Duke University and an expert on coastal problems , says : " If we made a careful analysis comparing today 's conditions to 50 years ago , we 'd find very few beaches as broad as they used to be . " A prime example is Fire Island off the south shore of Long Island , N.Y. , where the shore current , or littoral drift , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles longer . A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jetty system has trapped enough of the sand over the last 40 years to widen the island 's west end to its present width . Nature 's relentless assault is forcing the federal government to discourage coastal development , especially on the fragile barrier islands that rim the Atlantic and Gulf coasts . A recently enacted Coastal Barrier Resources Act , backed by both environmentalists and Interior Secretary James Watt , will block federal flood insurance and limit aid for road , bridge and sewer construction on barrier islands . Watt and environmentalist groups ? normally bitter foes ? find themselves on the same side , too , in a battle against Corps of Engineers plans to build two jetties near Nags Head , N.C. Backers argue that the 100-million-dollar project is needed to keep shifting sand from blocking a channel that gives fishing boats access to the Atlantic . By popular demand . The government faces an uphill battle on development . More than half the nation 's people live within an hour 's drive of a coast , and population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average . " People are rushing to the beach as the beach is rushing to them , " observes Duke University 's Pilkey . Many of those moving to the beaches are not aware of the enormous natural forces at work there . Gary Griggs , a geologist at the University of California at Santa Cruz , points out that the big boom in coastal growth came during a 15-year period of relatively calm weather . " That cycle appears to be ending , and these homes may not be designed to put up with the conditions that are truly common , " he says . Some of the big bills . Homeowners keep trying to fight the forces of the sea , but even the wealthy are feeling the pinch . Financing a 2.8-million-dollar , 1,400-foot-long sea wall to protect the Aptos Seascape development of luxury homes just south of Santa Cruz will cost each homeowner $100,000 . Protecting the most vulnerable 120 miles of California beaches with replacement sand , rocks , sea walls and groins ? fingerlike structures that extend out from the beach at an angle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Experts warn that bringing in new sand , at about $10 a cubic yard , in a process called beach nourishment , is at best a stopgap unless the area beyond the water 's edge is filled in , too . In New Jersey , the resort town of Sea Bright faces a 3.5-million-dollar bill for replacing jetties , groins and sand . So far , town officials are limited to using rocks to patch the giant holes gouged by last winter 's storms in the town 's 14-foot-high sea wall . Even so , life along the nation 's some 12,000 miles of coastline is too appealing for those dwelling there to give up easily . Explains Mayor Cecile Norton , who has lived in Sea Bright for 40 years : " It 's just too delightful to leave . We have the best of everything here . It 's going to be difficult , but we 're going to make repairs . " In Galveston , Tex. , the sea wall erected after a 1900 hurricane killed 6,000 people now has three rows of rocks ? called ripraps ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from undermining the barrier . Comments Vickie Allin of the Commerce Department 's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration : " Unless you 're willing to permit houses to . fall into the sea , you 're caught in a never ending cycle .
