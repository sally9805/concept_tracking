Teofilo Stevenson , his regal air enhanced by a placid smile , drifted through a post-midnight gathering following the World Championships ' Challenge last Friday night in the Los Angeles Sports Arena . When Cuba 's super-heavyweight came across his American rival , Tyrell Biggs , Stevenson , the three-time Olympic gold medalist , nodded and gently patted the current world amateur champion on the back several times . Then he walked away without having uttered a word . // Was the enigmatic Stevenson consoling Biggs , who earlier in the evening had been booed by his countrymen after he 'd defeated Francesco Damiani of Italy ? Or was it simply a show of affection ? Or was the aging Stevenson telling Biggs , whom Stevenson has beaten in their two fights , that Biggs 's performance against Damiani had in no way shaken Stevenson 's intention to win an unprecedented fourth gold medal in August , when the Olympic boxing competition will take place in the very same Sports Arena ? " I do n't know what he meant , " Biggs said . " He just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to read , so was the significance of the night 's 14 bouts in the last major international amateur boxing event before the Olympics . In organizing the second World Championships ' Challenge , International Amateur Boxing Association officials tried to match the winners of last year 's tournament , held partly in Reno and partly in Tokyo , with the winners of the World Cup , which was staged in Rome last October . The victor in each weight division would be crowned a world amateur champion . Of the 28 boxers on hand , four of whom took part in non-title exhibitions , 18 were either world champions or World Cup titlists , and 23 were ranked in the Top 5 in their international weight categories . // But AIBA ratings are taken about as seriously as speed limits are by L.A. motorists . This is particularly so in an Olympic year . The importance of the tournament was further diminished when the U.S.S.R. refused to participate because tournament officials would n't accede to the condition that Yuri Alexandrov , the No. 5-rated 119-pounder , be given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the U.S. six amateur world champions for the first time and , perhaps more important , one more title than Cuba , whose national team the U.S. has never beaten in a dual meet . // Three of the American victories were especially impressive . Pernell ( Pete ) Whitaker , a 132-pounder from Norfolk , Va. , continued his domination of his class with a 3-2 decision over Ramon Goire of Cuba , who had decked Whitaker in the second of the three rounds . At 156 pounds , Detroit 's Frank Tate decisioned world champion Shawn O'Sullivan , a Canadian who was suffering from the flu , and Ricky ( Wonderful ) Womack of Detroit stopped Pablo Romero of Cuba in the first round for the 178-pound crown . Biggs , 147-pound Mark Breland  --  fresh from winning a record fifth consecutive New York Golden Gloves title  --  and 119-pounder Floyd Favors of Capitol Heights , Md. , retained their crowns . // Cuba won five world championships , with standouts Pedro Reyes ( 112 pounds ) and Adolfo Horta ( 125 ) knocking out Steve McCrory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bernard Gray of Boynton Beach , Fla. , respectively . Canada 's 201-pounder , Willie deWit , who won a decision over substitute Henry Tillman of Los Angeles ( he stood in for an injured Italian ) , was the only fighter from a country other than the U.S. and Cuba to win a bout . // U.S. coach Pat Nappi was pleased with the evening 's results , but resisted comparing this aggregation to the 1976 U.S. team that won five gold medals in Montreal . " We do n't need what happened to our hockey team this year , " he explained in reference to the unduly high expectations that burdened the U.S. hockey team at Sarajevo . // Although far from being the deepest division , the super-heavyweight is the most intriguing one . Stevenson is currently ranked behind Damiani and Biggs , but many experts feel that at 33 Stevenson has enough left to win one last gold medal . In an exhibition bout against Biagio Chianese of Italy , a late substitute for America 's injured Craig Payne , Stevenson buffeted the 6 ' 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though at 220 pounds the 6 ' 4 " Stevenson looked trimmer than he did in February , when he defeated Biggs in a U.S.- Cuba tournament in Reno , he no longer has the cobra-quick righthand punch that knocked out Duane Bobick in Munich in 1972 and John Tate in Montreal in 1976 . " I did n't even feel his punches , " said Chianese , numbed nonetheless . // Stevenson wo n't admit it  --  " I do not describe myself , " he said at a press conference  --  but as his straight right has slowed , he has concentrated on his body punching . In 1982 he severely bruised two of Biggs 's ribs with a right hand before knocking him out with another right to the head . In February he again knocked Biggs down with a right in the vicinity of the belt line to win the third and decisive round of a close fight . // " The pressure got to Tyrell , and he kind of collapsed in the third round , " says Emanuel Steward , who trains Thomas Hearns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . " Tyrell learned a lot . He knows he can beat the man . Stevenson is my favorite heavyweight other than Ali . He was the most perfectly balanced fighter I ever saw . But he has slowed tremendously . " // Like Ali , Biggs can float like a butterfly  --  but unfortunately he also stings like one . Plus , he lacks the confidence most champions have . " I feel I probably can beat any super-heavyweight in the world , " Biggs said last week . Or : " I am probably the greatest . " // Against the 6 ' 1 " , 220-pound Damiani , a shaggy-haired brawler who has a Kirk Douglas chin and the nose of his favorite heavyweight , Gerry Cooney , Biggs jabbed effectively and made Damiani miss . Yet the crowd of 6,403 applauded Damiani and booed Biggs when the 4-1 decision was announced . Perhaps the knockout-hungry L.A. fans , accustomed as they are to pro fights , were unfamiliar with the tactics and scoring employed in amateur boxing , which stresses the number  --  not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanno fregato " ( I wuz robbed ) , said Damiani , who lost a 3-2 decision to Biggs in their 1982 World Championship bout in Munich . // Biggs was more hurt by the booing than by Damiani 's punches . " What do they want from me ? " he said . " I fought my fight . I do n't want to make this a racial thing .... Maybe they just did n't enjoy the fight . " // The boxers enjoyed Los Angeles . They stayed at the well-appointed Century Plaza Hotel and trained at a new high-tech gym off Sunset Strip called Quest-star . Actor Gene Hackman , who took a break from his own workout to watch the U.S. team train , was immediately spotted by Womack , who called out to the villain of Superman , " Lex Luthor ! How you doin ' ? " The Italians took especial joy in the place , kissing the hands of skimpily Danskinned women . Chianese , whose training habits are a standing joke in the Italian contingent , even participated in an aerobics class before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitaker might have felt inclined to do the same against Goire . " He gave me the worst two rounds of my life , " said Whitaker , a brash southpaw who has beaten Cuba 's two-time Olympic champ , Angel Herrera , in each of their last four meetings . In the third round the boxers slugged for an extra 10 seconds because the bell was drowned out by the cheering . Before the fight Whitaker had said , " I 'm looking for a standing ovation , " and after his 3-2 decision , he got it . // Breland , whom Steward calls " the most talented boxer I 've ever worked with , " scored a 5-0 decision over iron-jawed Luciano Bruno . More significant , Breland suffered no pain in his right hand , which was operated on last June to repair a damaged tendon. // Womack , who had split with Romero in two previous fights , decided in the first round that this night the two-time world champion " was an impostor , and I had to get him out of there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Stevenson . After a wobbly Romero took a standing eight count and was knocked down again , the referee stopped the bout . " Continuing would have been very , very damaging to his health , " Womack said . // Injuries clearly concern Stevenson , who , in one of the few definitive statements he made last week , said , " I have my health . Everything else is secondary . " The only thing that got as much as a rise out of him was the cumulative effect of repeated questions about his chances for the fourth gold . Finally relenting , Stevenson said , " I 've always believed I can do it . And I will do it . " Now , Tyrell , you know what the pats were about .
