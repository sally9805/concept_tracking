Wednesday , 8 of the city ' s 13 Representatives joined a 241-to-190 majority in voting to kill financing for what the Navy calls its home-port plan. // Navy officials , as well as local proponents of the home port , said they would work to reverse the action , but Representative Samuel S. Stratton , an upstate Democrat and a ranking member of the Armed Services Committee , said saving the plan would take " some miracle. " // " I think it tells a good deal about the New York delegation , " said Mr. Stratton , a strong supporter of the home port . " If New York is going to have any clout , we ' ve got to work together. " // // Supported in Past // Most of the votes against the plan to build 10 new bases were predictable : from the Mountain and Plains states , which do not have and can not get Navy bases , and from coastal states that are worried about losing parts of the Navy bases they already have. // The unpredictable votes came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Representatives of voting against a military construction project for their own region - a project whose proponents , including at one time most of the Congressmen now voting against it , had argued would bring jobs to the Port of New York. // This was not missed during the voting Wednesday , said Representative Guy V. Molinari , a Staten Island Republican who has fought for the home port . When he buttonholed colleagues from other states to round up votes , he said , several pointed to the big , electronic board that was recording votes as they were cast and said , " Look what your own people are doing. " // Until the House vote , Mr. Molinari said , all of the states that would have received new bases had supported each other . But now , he said , supporters in some southern states were considering a plan to support construction of several southern bases , which are less expensive , while abandoning the New York base . <> <> Fear of Nuclear Accident // Several of the New York Representatives said a combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuclear accident at Chernobyl , which heightened fears of a shipboard nuclear accident , to Federal budget cutting. // Several New Yorkers also said the vote was a clear example of how much the region misses its most influential Congressman on military matters , Joseph P. Addabbo , who died this year. // " There are some Democrats who would have voted otherwise if Joe were alive , " Mr. Molinari said. // For several years now the Navy has been pressing its plan to begin " dispersing " its dramatically expanded fleet . Proponents , led by Navy Secretary John F. Lehman , say the dispersal is crucial to protect the fleet from " Pearl Harbor " - type attacks. // Critics , who include Senator Barry M. Goldwater , say the plan is largely an effort by the Navy to garner new political support at considerable cost by spreading Navy spending to the new bases , which are proposed for Staten Island , San Francisco , Everett , Wash. , and seven ports on the Gulf Coast . <> <> Delegation Lists Benefits // On March 16 , 1983 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York Harbor . The letter was signed by every member of the New York Congressional delegation except Representative Ted Weiss , a West Side Democrat who has consistently opposed the project. // The letter summarized the arguments in favor of bringing the Navy base to New York . Particularly , the home port would help reverse " the imbalance " in defense spending between New York and other parts of the country , the letter said. // " Our enthusiastic support for the proposal , " the Congressmen wrote , " is echoed by virtually every constituency in this region . We are anxious to welcome the U.S. Navy ' s increased presence in the harbor . " <> <> Lobbying by Antinuclear Group // But the eagerness was overtaken by anxiety , as supporters of the nuclear-freeze movement mounted a campaign against the plan that would equip the battleships to carry nuclear weapons . Opponents gathered more than 100 , 000 signatures on a petition to force a city referendum on the home port , but the courts barred the vote. // The lobbying , however , continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battery Park tonight to protest the use of the Iowa as President Reagan ' s flagship for viewing the July 4 celebration of the Statue of Liberty. // Mr. Weiss , who has repeatedly raised the specter of a nuclear accident , said he believed the seven city colleagues who joined him in Wednesday ' s vote included several who were concerned with the issue of " bringing nuclear-armed ships into New York " and others who " came along when it became clear that budgetarily it was a real problem. " // The Navy has estimated the cost of the home-port plan at $800 million , about half of this for Staten Island and Everett . Critics say the real cost is far higher. // The eight New Yorkers , all Democrats , who voted against the home port were , with the exception of Mr. Weiss , skittish about being seen as opposing a military presence or resisting the presence of nuclear weapons - an issue that has strained relations between the United States and New Zealand and sparked protests across Europe . <> <> ' Severe Budgetary Restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee , Charles B. Rangel , who is running for whip of the House , Major R. Owens and Edolphus Towns , signed a letter on June 4 with Mr. Weiss , citing the budgetary arguments against the project. // " We want to stress that we believe the question at hand is not simply whether New York should have a home port , " they wrote , " but whether a national home-porting plan is appropriate for the nation at this time of severe budgetary restraints. " // The letter made no mention of nuclear weapons. // The other three New Yorkers voting against the home port were Representatives Gary Ackerman , Robert Garcia and Charles E. Schumer . <> <> Obstacles for Supporters // The House vote was a problem for supporters of the Staten Island port in two respects . First , it means they will have to find 26 Representatives who will switch their votes to support the overall home-port program. // But , second , even if the general principle of dispersing the fleet wins Congressional support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battle group in a port whose leadership is so divided on welcoming them. // There was no comment from the Navy yesterday other than to say that Secretary Lehman still strongly supported the principle of dispersing the fleet and would fight to reverse the House vote or have the money restored in the fall by a conference committee with the Senate , where support has been only slightly stronger. //
