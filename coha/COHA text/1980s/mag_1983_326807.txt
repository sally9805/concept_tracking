Making criminals fight crime <P> Creating a punishment to fit a crime is not always easy . All too often , the judicial choices come in two basic modes : prison terms or fines .

Missouri Valley will now pay a $325,000 fine , but will then ante up $1,475,000 to endow a chair in business ethics at the University of Nebraska . <P> As part of the agreement , the company will be on probation for five years , so that the judge can review its future bidding practices .

Like the University of Nebraska , all the recipients have been delighted .
