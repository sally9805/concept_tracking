A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY by John Irving ; Morrow ; 543 pages ; $19.95 <P> Accidents usually accelerate John Irving 's antic plots and keep his readers tuned for what happens next . A Prayer for Owen Meany takes a somewhat different approach . Framed by the myth of victim as redeemer , the book removes guesswork without reducing expectations . One knows going in that the mischievous author is staging a kind of " Gospel According to Charlie Brown . " But anyone familiar with Irving 's mastery of narrative technique , his dark humor and moral resolve also knows his fiction is cute like a fox . <P> Irving 's inventive stamina and virtuosity scarcely disguise his indignation about the ways of the world , particularly about the manner in which U.S. foreign policy has been conducted in the past 25 years . The period includes John F. Kennedy 's military intervention in Viet Nam and Ronald Reagan 's resurrection of 19th century jingoism over Central America . <P> Through the miracle of literary hindsight , the mess of two decades is foreseen by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite quarrier 's son who speaks in capital letters and believes the sacrificial arc of his life has been plotted by God . The novel 's narrator is John Wheelwright , Meany 's prep-school mate and eventually his leading apostle . <P> As in hagiographies and heroic tales , faith is tested by adversity . Wheelwright 's challenge is vintage Irving , an event that is simultaneously horrifying and absurdly funny . It occurs during a Little League game in the summer of 1953 when Meany , in the lineup because his diminutive strike zone draws walks , swings away . He connects for a mighty foul ball that shoots toward the stands and fatally strikes Wheelwright 's mother on the head . The game is suspended along with , it is hoped , the reader 's disbelief . <P> Wheelwright recalls this and subsequent apocalypses from his home in Toronto , where he has lived as an expatriate for 20 years . Assimilation is difficult ; Canada is under the perpetual influence of a hot-air mass pumped in by media from the south , and Wheelwright is a U.S. news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives good disaster . " <P> Irving does not let his narrator have the liveliest lines . Wheelwright is passive by design . The vigorous Puritan tradition of his ancestors has become thin and unsteady . His role is to record the actions of others and canonize his childhood friend . <P> Despite its theological proppings , A Prayer for Owen Meany is a fable of political predestination . As usual , Irving delivers a boisterous cast , a spirited story line and a quality of prose that is frequently underestimated , even by his admirers . On the other hand , the novel invites trespass by symbol hunters . One can easily imagine college sophomores arguing over the meaning of a stuffed armadillo that has had its claws removed , or the significance of Wheelwright 's carrying his small friend on his shoulders to slam-dunk a basketball . For graduate students there is the fact that Meany shares more than initials with Oskar Matzerath , the runt hero of Gunter Grass 's masterpiece , The Tin Drum .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
