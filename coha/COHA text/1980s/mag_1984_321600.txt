The world 's news events piled atop each other with bewildering rapidity last week . Their character was remarkably varied : ominous , reassuring , inspirational , showy , frustrating . The death of the leader of the Soviet Union was announced , with all its implications for the future of that socialist superpower and its troubled relationship with the U.S. In the face of more violence and political uncertainty in Lebanon , President Reagan acted to redeploy the Marines . For the first time , men floated freely in the heavens , breaking away from the shuttle Challenger to become human satellites . In Sarajevo , Yugoslavia , the XIV Winter Olympics opened with impressive pageantry , only to have events " whited out " by too much of a good thing : snow . In sum , it was a remarkable week for journalism and for TIME . <P> It began on Monday with a meaningful moment for the magazine , as President Ronald Reagan celebrated his 73rd birthday and the 129th anniversary of the founding of Eureka College , his alma mater , by giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for a historical perspective in evaluating the changes that have transformed America over the past five decades .

They will represent a wide range of political and philosophic views and , it is hoped , will provoke lively discussion and debate between the newsmakers and their student audiences . <P> President Reagan , who has been on 24 TIME covers , caught the spirit of the program and the challenge the speakers could offer their audiences when he said : " I hope that 50 years from now , should TIME magazine ask you for your reflections , you 'll be able to recall an era exciting beyond all of your dreams .
