So says Sir Kenneth Cork , one of the most respected and knowledgeable theatrical observers here . The unprecedented , 95-point Cork report recommends an overhaul of the massive state-funded portion of British theater . The report was presented last September and endorsed in April ( with two exceptions ) by the Arts Council , Britain ' s public funding body for the performing arts. // // ' ' We ' ve got the best theater in the world . It is our best export , ' ' says Sir Kenneth . ' ' At the same time , all the subsidized theater companies in Great Britain are in a chronic disaster. ' ' // The Cork report calls for some of the most innovative changes in more than a quarter-century. // These include the first specific guidelines on remuneration for transfer productions - those successful shows , such as the recent Royal Shakespeare Company ( RSC ) hit ' ' Les Miserables , ' ' that move from a subsidized to a commercial theater. // Other recommendations address the financial and management problems besieging Britain ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inquiry report , which was submitted by an independent committee of theater professionals headed by Sir Kenneth , was requested by the British government and the Arts Council in response to growing concern about the current and future health of British theater. // In a interview with the Monitor , Sir Kenneth , who is also a former chairman of the Royal Shakespeare Company and a respected accounting and theater business expert , repeated the need for sweeping financial reform among Britain ' s subsidized theaters. // ' ' When the Arts Council was first set up in the 1940s , it was given a lot of money to fund companies , ' ' said Sir Kenneth . ' ' But once the companies are funded , there is very little option ( about how to fund them differently ) the next year . It ' s a bottomless pit , and the theaters lose face by constantly relying on this begging bowl ( approach. ) // ' ' The whole ( government funding ) thing has to be rethought , ' ' he added . ' ' The Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to organize funding for theater as a whole with new schemes. ' ' // Sir Kenneth ' s personal recommendations - beyond the scope of the official report - range from modifying Britain ' s tax laws to stimulate charitable giving , to instigating new theater promotional arrangements that would better draw on the support of private industry. // He also recommends earmarking a percentage of Arts Council funding to produce transfer shows , as a way of recouping a greater commercial return for the subsidized theaters . And he suggests using theater funding as a way to foster urban renewal in economically depressed regions. // ' ' There is general criticism in this country that London gets an unfair proportion of government ( arts ) funding , ' ' he says , adding that ' ' unlike the United States , private industry here only wants to fund big companies in London , not the regions . But one of the better and cheaper ways to bring life back to the depressed city centers is to revivify the theaters . Look at Stratford . There are 15 hotels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Royal Shakespeare Company theaters there. ' ' // Sir Kenneth ' s proposals are considered groundbreaking , because unlike its more independent American counterpart , British theater has established its reputation on a decades-old tradition of generous state patronage. // The result has been an impressive network of theaters , including the two world-renowned national companies , the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre . However , the stringent economic policies of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have caused a financial squeeze among the subsidized theaters , which receive 25 to 50 percent of their operating budgets from the government. // As a result , theater professionals here cite problems : a decline in the number of large-scale classical productions , a shortage of qualified Shakespearean actors , and a growing tendency by the RSC and the National Theatre to rely on commercial earnings. // ' ' Many companies are in a very serious position now , says Ian Brown , drama director for the Arts Council . ' ' And next year is going to be even more difficult . There used to be some flexibility in finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real tightening of money. ' ' // Although the Cork report calls for as much as ( STR ) 14 million ( $23 million ) of additional government subsidy to supplement the current ( STR ) 26 million ( $43 million ) Arts Council theater budget , it is the other , unorthodox proposals that are getting the most attention here. // One controversial proposal in the report called for a special levy on the publicly funded British Broadcasting Corporation as a recompense to theater for developing much of the talent seen in British TV dramas . Although that proposal was subsequently unendorsed by the Arts Council , it is indicative of the iconoclastic attitudes reflected in the report. // Indeed , one of the report ' s chief recommendations is the establishment of a consortium of six regional theater companies to better utilize existing resources as well as boost those companies ' status vis-a-vis the prestigious London-based RSC and National Theatre . ' ' We ' re becoming more and more divided into two countries - London and the regions , ' ' says Sir Kenneth . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the arts. ' ' // Despite the endorsement of more than 90 percent of his report by the Arts Council , any government implementation of the proposals must await further recommendation by Arts Council chairman William Rees-Mogg. // He has already termed the report a ' ' milestone in the history of public funding for theater in Britain. ' ' // No changes are expected to be made until the coming fiscal year , which starts next April. // ' ' Quite frankly , disaster will ensue if these proposals are not adopted , ' ' says Sir Kenneth , who is currently at work on an Arts Council follow-up report due later this year. // ' ' The whole thing is going broke , ' ' he says . ' ' Without real changes , the whole thing will simply continue to deteriorate. ' ' // //
