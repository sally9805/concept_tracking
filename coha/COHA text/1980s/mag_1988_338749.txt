When it comes to country music , there is a choice of parties . <P> Hank Williams Jr . has a roarer going on over at a big spread near Nashville . It 's really a video event , fired up just so there could be a raucous , celebrity-studded promo for Hank 's hit tune , All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming over Tonight . And there it is , a real booze-and-barbecue bash , with lots of huggy-bunny country gals sashaying all around folks who dropped in , sometimes via limo , to pay old Hank Jr . their respects . There 's Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson . Hank Jr . sings his song , roaming all around the large house and out into the yard , which appears to be the size of one of the smaller islands in the Pacific archipelago . The visiting celebs all make eye contact with the camera . Everyone looks to be having a helluva good time . <P> Rodney Crowell has a party going on too , and it 's also for a video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenn. , he grabs his guitar and starts lip- syncing the words to I Could n't Leave You If I Tried . He stops what little traffic there is . Drivers and passengers , none of them recognizable to anyone but their neighbors , climb out of cars , pickups and delivery trucks to join in the song . They all smile , mostly at one another , and dance around . <P> You can forget about all those snazzy houses and all those famous folks . Hank and Willie and Waylon and other " outlaws " of the ' 70s have suddenly become  --  no , could it be ?  --  the older generation in country music . The Crowell shindig is right where the action in country music has moved : the crossroads . There has been a lot of traffic there lately , at the delicate junction where country meets its past , sizes up its future and  --  probably most important  --  guns its musical motor and goes off in its own direction . And Crowell , a wonderfully gifted songwriter and rambunctious performer , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once all the records sold and hits charted and awards won are totted up , the slickest wheels on the road would belong to Randy Travis , 29 , whose first album , Storms of Life , sold 2 million copies , whose second , Always and Forever , sold 3 million .. Travis ' major career worry for the past year would appear to be that his new album , called Old 8x10 and just now in stores , might dislodge Always from the top of the country charts , where it has perched for almost a year . One million copies of Old 8x10 have already been ordered up by retail outlets , and reorders seem a solid bet . The record 's blend of sweet vocals and straightforward sentiment should go down smoothly with Travis ' growing number of fans . <P> Travis has some daunting stats going for him , sure enough . But all the commotion in country music right now is more than just a matter of numbers . Overall , its radio share has remained consistent during the past few years ; it corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of records and tapes are fine , thank you : in 1987 , country accounted for about 10% of the 5.6 billion musical dollars plunked down in the U.S.
