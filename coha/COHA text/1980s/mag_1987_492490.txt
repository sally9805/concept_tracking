the nastiest forms I 've ever wept over . Their modus operandi is to slip on fallen fruit in supermarkets , trip over footstools in shoe stores , fall into holes dug by sewer districts , step in front of small foreign cars moving slowly through intersections , climb over hospital bed side rails and dive headfirst for the floor . On a quiet afternoon , I can stand on any downtown street corner and hear the distant thud of a Bustamonte . In homage to the Hying Wallendas , I have named them the Diving Bustamontes . I have often thought of resigning from their care , but I have n't the heart to inflict the Bustamontes or their forms on a beloved colleague  --  or even a hated one . The only way I can keep pace is to examine the stricken Bustamonte in a hurry and fill out the form before he or she can fall off my examining table . Do n't Plant Time Bombs in Your Office I may always be late , but I never waste time . Like a blackjack pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can look at a patient 's fingernails for one second and make the diagnosis of chronic arsenic poisoning that another doctor missed during 30 half-hour visits over five years . If I lose my concentration , then I become the bimbo some hotshot internist one-ups five years later . In my practice , I 've got to move fast but not so fast that I empty my office of problems that come back to haunt me . I do n't want to send a malignant melanoma out my door because I 'm too rushed to have my patient fully disrobe during a checkup . That melanoma is a time bomb that will explode two years later when I finally detect it  --  far-advanced  --  on the back of my patient 's thigh . If 1 had taken a few moments to check the patient 's skin two years before , he would now be cured instead of imminently dead . I have to be ruthless with my time . I can effectively deal with the sore throat of an established patient in 3 minutes . I then have 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient with chronic back pain who has brought in a 35-pound stack of old X-rays . I know at a glance that his back pain is caused by hauling that load of films to numberless consultants , but need 25 minutes to get up the courage to tell him . Make a House Call and Become a Legend in Your Own Time If the patient can withstand the shock , I offer to make a house call . Once I get there , I never regret it . A house call is such a novelty these days that the patient 's family ca n't do enough to express their gratitude . " You 're a saint to come all the way out here to see Grandpa ! " " Can I take your coat ? " " Would you like a cup of coffee ? " " How about a 64-piece set of sterling silver ? Sheldon , carry the silver to the doctor 's car . " Of course , if the patient had received this much loving care , he would n't have needed a house call in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too sick to get out of bed to see the doctor . Rather than punish him for his infirmity by having an ambulance drag race him - to the nearest emergency room , the doctor can jolly well hitch up the horse and buggy and go out in the snowstorm to the patient 's bedside . Although the horse and buggy have been replaced by the Mustang and Volkswagen , the only modern way to cope with a snowstorm is to practice in Palm Springs . Despite the time and trouble , I have almost always found the house call a vivid experience . Last year I paid a visit to the bedside of a dying cellist . The elderly veteran of the symphony lay propped up on one half of a double bed , staring straight ahead . His cancer of the liver had spread widely since my last visit . His thin , jaundiced body with its distended abdomen was a grotesque caricature of the very instrument he played . His silver-haired wife was a blur of activity in contrast to his stillness . She took my coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and turned on the bedside lamp . After I examined him , I was hard put to say anything that would cornfort him or his wife . 1 followed his gaze and noticed his gorgeous cello  --  as silent and delicate as the patient  --  standing against the wall . The old , deeply polished instrument lay inside a new padded vinyl case that stood open . " I bought Herman a new case for his cello , just before he got sick , " said his wife , her eyes brimming . My God , I thought , he 's staring at his own funeral ! " The cello and the case are beautiful , " I said , looking up at the wife . " But let me suggest you carry them out to the hall . " With a slightly hurt look , she obeyed . While she was out of the room , the patient 's face relaxed . He smiled at me and said , " Thank you , doctor ; I did n't want to hurt Gerda 's feelings . " When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first peaceful sleep he had had in days . He never woke up . Do n't Try to Feel a Breast Lump over the Telephone The moment a woman calls to say she 's discovered a breast lump , I tell her to come over at once . Until I see her , she 's in a frenzy of suspense . I usher her into the exam room as soon as she arrives  --  no New Yorkers for her . If the lump feels suspicious , I explain right off that I 'd like to have a surgeon biopsy it . She 's expecting the worst anyway , so there 's no use telling her , " Do n't worry  --  there 's always a chance it 's benign , " or " Do n't worry  --  let 's get mammograms , " or " Do n't worry  --  lots of lumps go away by themselves , blah , blah , blah . " Get her to the best surgeon in town , who will cut out the blah , blah , blah  --  and the lump . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't , for God 's sake , charge her . ( This article is not subtitled How to Be the World 's Richest Doctor . ) If the lump is benign , I celebrate with her ; if it 's malignant , I tell her every happy story I know about 20-year survivals . Indeed , I 've stuck around long enough to have patients thank me 20 years after the mastectomies just for having been there . I 'm a pushover for pharmaceutical salespeople . I 've tried to analyze why I allow myself to be propagandized by these well-groomed supplicants of the Corporate Drug Structure . Is it because my father was a struggling shirt salesman ? Do I invite a detail rep into my office to keep a drug pusher off the streets ? Am I so intellectually starved that my mind hungers for the advertising pap of the caplet cartels ? Am I trying to amass the world 's largest collection of antihistamine samples ? Am I afraid to say no ? No . None of the above . The reason I see detail reps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three-dimensional plastic colon  --  so glistening , pink , and upright on its fragile stand ! Through a window in its splenic flexure , one can see the lurid red and yellowness of amoebic dysentery . My plastic colon makes a perfect centerpiece for our dining room table when we entertain guests who profess to be on diets . And how I treasure my dozen hollow plastic kidneys ! They make ideal bathtub toys for doctors and their children . You 've never heard of floating kidneys ? Thanks to the munificence of detail reps , I have a different ball-point pen for every day of the year . I could retire from medicine tomorrow and live for a decade on the sales of my promotional pens , flashlights , tranquilizers , and plastic viscera . ( " Good morning . I 'm ' Doc ' London . Please accept this complimentary Valium tablet . Can I interest you in a plastic pancreas today ? " ) In recent years , women have entered the ranks of medical sales reps . The first time a female detail rep handed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the day Prosciutto married into the Melon family . So I am now in the some-would-say enviable position of having intelligent , well-dressed women dying to shower me with gifts . How I love to sit down and listen to them rhapsodize about the half-life of their latest tranquilizer . How I love to fantasize about leaning over my desk and asking one of them if she 'd be willing to spend a half-life of tranquility with you know why a baby can sleep 22 hours out of 24 ? Because a baby ( we 're talking male baby here ) is n't married , that 's why . Let one of those little suckers tie the knot , and if he closes his eyes for 2 hours out of the 24 he 's lucky . When I was single I could go to sleep on a picket fence . No problem . I did even better in my two o'clock Spanish class in college . But after uniting my plight with a member of the opposing sex through the ritual of holy wedlock , take it from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it me bon ami ? -1 have n't enjoyed what you 'd call the sleep of the drugged since . My wife , who has a Ph.D . in husband waking , has made waking me up her life 's work . One of her favorite strategies is to turn off the TV while I 'm lying on the sofa and watching a ball game . One time it was to get me to taste some questionable leftover stew before she fed it to her precious cat , Snowflake ( or Flaky , as I choose to call her ) . Running a close second to the delight of waking me up is the satisfaction my wife derives from preventing my going to sleep in the first place . The Cockroach Caper was one of her most successful machinations . While dallying in the express lane at the supermarket , she had read the front page of one of those weird weeklies , which claimed you could get rid of roaches by sprinkling baking soda in their runways . Seems the little fellers eat the soda , and being unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . And by golly , it worked . I spent the next three nights lying wide-eyed in bed while I listened to cockroaches explode . There goes one now . Or take the time I was going to drink a glass of warm milk before retiring . While the milk was heating in the pan , my dear wife , thinking I was preparing my favorite dish  --  eggs in milk over toast  --  slipped in an egg for herself.back . Turned out to be the classic Case of the Coughing Corpse . " A book you ca n't put down , " boasted the blurb on the front . And it was n't far wrong , for someone had spilled honey on the cover . And you talk about mystery  --  it was a mystery from the word go . The first four pages were missing . However , like a snail with a charley horse , sleep finally began creeping up on me . Laying the book quietly on the night stand , I reached over , turned out the light , and then ever so gently pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know who did it ! " came this clacking at my side . And it was good night , John , I 've brought your saddle home , as the saying goes . " The butler . " " Way off . " " I really do n't care . " " You 'd never guess anyway . " By getting up four times to splash cold water on my face , 1 finished the book just before daybreak . Turned out the victim had done himself in from a habit calling for four packs of cigarettes a day . Not only did he cough himself to death  --  strange sounds could be heard coming from the grave for the next three days . A free epitaph chiseled in marble had been offered by the tobacco people : It was n't the cough That carried him off : It was the coffin They carried him off in . ? ? ? Into the life of every married man there come times when , through some fluke , he gets a night out on his own . His wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ways of keeping hubby awake . So hubby drags in at 5:45 a.m. , too tired to take off his shoes before hitting the old sack . And who is the bright-eyed reception committee of one awaiting him in bed ? It 's not Flaky the cat . Oh , the unbridled joy of the mattreated wife on such occasions . Nothing else in the inventory of female emotions can approach it . Since the crime is most often committed on a Saturday night , the poor culprit will be home on Sunday , when the slightest evidence of weariness can be detected . I well recall my own abused wife 's inspirations upon several of these glorious opportunities : " Let 's move it , chum . Anyone who can stay out all night certainly has the constitution to mow the lawn without lying down between laps . " " Of course we 're going for a Sunday drive ! If you can keep your eyes open for 29 hours straight , they should be used to it by now . " " That 's right , stay out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump you out of the hammock ! " " You know very well we 're going to the movies tonight . Now come down off that picket fence and get your jacket on . " Researching the insomnia experts has n't helped . One idiot suggested that listening to a repetitious sound would do the trick . I had my doubts right from the start . I 've been listening to a repetitious sound now for more years than I care to remember , but one night in desperation I thought I 'd give it a shot . Stumbling out of bed and fumbling my way into the bathroom , I sat on the edge of the tub and turned on the cold water tap to a steady glib . . . glob. . . glup. ? . glib . . . glob. . . glup , etc . The next thing I knew , my dear wife was slapping me back to life and leading me to the bed . The next thing after that , she was telling me for heaven 's sake to get out of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating in something more than three-quarter time , I would listen to it . By lying face down I could make the old ticker tick ' em off loud and clear . Thump . thump . . thumpity thump .. thump . . . thump . . . thumpity thump . . . thump . . thump thump . What , what , what ! I sat up . Was my imagination playing tricks , or was I a thumpity short ? By this time the cadence of the old pump was banking off the walls : thump .. thump thump . No doubt about it , I was hitting on only three cylinders . I pulled up the sheet to wipe the sweat off my brow . " What on earth are you doing now ? " dear wife groaned . " It 's my heart , " I groaned back . " Well , stop it . " " But it 's missing . " " We 'll look for it in the morning , " she mumbled , turning over and jabbing her toenails into my leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wo n't listen to that thump . . . thump sss000shl Oh no ! My main dike must have given way . " Get a doctor ! " I gasped . " I 'm going --  " " Don't. . . forget . . rubbers , " she muttered . I spent the rest of the night on the sofa . It would be much easier for the men in the white coats to carry me out in the morning . " To sleep : perchance to dream : ay , there 's the rub ; /For in that sleep of death what dreams may come/When we have shuffled off this mortal coil , /Must give us pause . " So wrote Mr. William Shakespeare in another tragic work under the title of Hamlet . From the way it looks , except for twin beds , or twin bedrooms , or changing mattresses , or changing wives , shuffling off this mortal coil is about my only hope for getting more than two hours of sleep a night . Whatever the dreams that may come , they 'll be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador to France in the 1700s , thoroughly enjoyed his sampling of pasta dishes in Naples . The statesman was so smitten with the simple " maccarony " that he ordered crates of the noodle sent back to the United States along with a pasta-making machine . Once ashore , the noodle was here to stay . Weathering the picks and pans of fans and food critics alike , pasta is basking in a more flattering , wholesome new light . Nutritionists no longer bad-mouth pasta as high in calories and short on nutrition . To the contrary , food scientists insist that pasta scores a perfect ten in meeting nutritional needs , offering low-fat alternatives in the daily diet , and actually helping the calorie-conscious lose weight . Because it is a low-fat , easy-to-digest food , pasta isideal for people of all ages .
