What it also contains , for the first time in the Koch administration , are goals aimed at restoring city services to their highest levels in a decade . For example , the Mayor hopes by 1988 to have a uniformed police force of 30 , 600 officers , one-fifth more than at present and the greatest number since the fiscal crisis of 1975. // For the fiscal year that begins July 1 , the Mayor proposes to add 1 , 000 police officers , 300 street cleaners and 269 parks workers , to increase pothole repairs and decrease the size of first- grade classes - and to accomplish all this without raising taxes. // // // ' Hasten Our Progress ' // // " These improvements will hasten our progress toward a quality of life that some New Yorkers remember and all of us want , " the Mayor said in his message to the Board of Estimate and City Council , which have until June 5 to revise and adopt the budget. // Overall , next year ' s budget would be $982 million more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current fiscal year . The city work force is to grow by about 9 , 500 in the coming year . By the end of fiscal 1985 , the new budget calls for 192 , 246 city-financed positions. // The budget provides for pay increases of 2 percent for city employees in each of the next two years. // Because the Mayor has been doling out agency-by-agency details of his " best news " budget for the last two weeks , there was little surprising in the document that was sent to the board and Council yesterday , except for the delineation of some long-range goals. // Only last month , the Mayor ridiculed the setting of " artificial goals . " Yesterday , he insisted his new goals were not artificial . " It is not possible to project our goals for 1988 as a rose garden , " he said , " but it is certainly less filled with weeds. " // Mr. Koch also said shifts in spending over the years meant that budgets would not be comparable . " If you ' re asking will we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " the answer is no. " // He named the problem of the homeless as one of those shifts . A report that was also released yesterday showed that the city had spent $7 million in the expense budget for homeless individuals in 1978 . Next year , that figure is expected to be $75. 9 million. // As he has before , the Mayor rejected the notion that his budget was a political creation . " It ' s not an election year , " he said during the City Hall news conference . Technically speaking , however , this budget embraces the first six months of the year in which Mr. Koch plans to seek re-election . <> <> Improvements ' Long Deserved ' // // Instead , the Mayor said : " A nationwide economic recovery is well under way and its effects are being felt here . We are projecting growth in our tax revenues which can support additional spending . We are at last in a position to offer to the people of New York City **28;896; some <> of the enhancements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some of the Koch administration ' s objectives for the 1985 fiscal year and beyond : // // - Police - 1 , 000 additional officers and 175 additional civilians are to be hired next year , at a cost of $21. 3 million , to bring the uniformed force to 26 , 145. // // - Sanitation - 300 additional street cleaners are to be hired next year , at a cost of $6. 8 million , to bring the Clean Team crew to 850 workers . The goal by 1988 is to make 72 percent of the streets acceptably clean , the highest number since 1976. // // - Education - 847 additional teachers are to be hired next year , at a cost of $12. 3 million , to reduce the average size of a first-grade class to 25 students from the current 30 . The future goal is to reduce the size of other early classes. // // - Transportation - 100 additional street maintenance workers are to be hired next year and " wear and tear " repairs are to be increased , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be created for $1 million. // // - Parks - 269 additional parks maintenance workers will be hired next year , at a cost of $6. 1 million , including carpenters , electricians , plumbers and masons. // But Mr. Koch also noted that a number of unpredictable things might interfere with the optimistic plans he laid out . What he called a " very difficult matter " is the settlement that the city must eventually reach with the municipal labor unions . The proposed budget provides for wage increases of 2 percent in each of the two coming years. // A single percentage point jump in that settlement would cost the city $68 million in the next fiscal year and $85 million in the year after that . <> <> ' Clouding the City ' s Budget ' // // " A major uncertainty clouding the city ' s budget for 1985 and beyond are the labor negotiations now under way , " said Harrison J. Goldin , the City Comptroller. // Comer S. Coppie , executive director of the state Financial Control Board , the city ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers were proposed at a time when the labor settlement was uncertain. // Philip Caruso , president of the Patrolmen ' s Benevolent Association , took another view of a budget that added officers while limiting wage increases . His union has called for raises of 15 percent in each of the two years of the next contract. // " I think that 2 percent is absurd , obviously , " he said . " It ' s unrealistic and everyone concerned knows that . We can ' t allow the Mayor to think he can restore full strength in terms of police services over the economic deprivation of our members. " // Victor Gotbaum , president of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , said , " I remind people that 2 percent is 1 percent less than the Mayor projected the last time , and our increases were in the range of 8 percent . " <> <> Money May Be ' Hidden ' // // Alair A. Townsend , the Budget Director , was asked whether the Office of Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the money needed for a larger settlement within its enormous budget. // " I am not going to speculate on how we are going to fund the settlement , " she answered . Later , Mayor Koch said , " I ' m not going to tell you where the reductions will take place. " // But yesterday , as aides scurried through the marble corridors of City Hall carrying the nine-volume , 4 , 246- page budget document , there was little talk of cutting back. // " It ' s a good-news budget , but we can make it better , " said Councilman Edward L. Sadowsky , chairman of the Council ' s Finance Committee. // Mr. Sadowsky said he would like to see 1 , 500 new police officers hired , instead of 1 , 000 ; 400 new street cleaners , rather than 300. // The Queens Democrat also noted that the Mayor had revised his estimate of a surplus this year from $175 million in January to $293 million now . Mr. Sadowsky ' s own estimate is $500 million and , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to close. " // //
