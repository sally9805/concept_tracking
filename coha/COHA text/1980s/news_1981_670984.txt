" He likes lots of seasonings - plenty of pepper , garlic and onions and lots of salt , " said Cindy Volper , who as been the cook at Gracie Mansion since last November and will stay at least until the end of the year. // " The first time he asked for Limburger cheese , I could feel my eyes roll up to the ceiling , but now I ' m used to it , " she said as she served lunch to a visitor in the big , bright yellow and white kitchen of the Mayor ' s official residence . " But I still can ' t believe how much garlic and anchovies he can swallow in one gulp of the Caesar salad dressing I prepare for him . At first I put very little anchovy and garlic in the dressing , but that ' s not the way my customer likes it , so I had to adjust. // // ' He ' s Always Watching His Weight ' // " When the Mayor eats alone he genarally has steak , chops or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s always watching his weight . He often calls me to say he will be home in 20 minutes and to put the meat under the broiler . He eats those meals in his study if he is working , in the library if he watches television , or sometimes here , " she said , indicating the cheerful green and white wallpapered breakfast room opening onto the kitchen . " If he is not having guests he often eats in a restaurant. " // Such days are relatively easy for the 24-year-old cook , who won her job immediately after graduating from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park , N.Y. In addition to being interviewed by Dorothy Aschkenasy , the assistant to the Mayor for special events , Miss Volper auditioned by cooking dinner for 15 . The menu included cream of onion soup , Cornish hens stuffed with rice , mushrooms and giblets , green salad and one of her favorite desserts - a large round and deep apple-custard tart. // " It was really the Mayor who decided on Cindy , " Mrs. Aschkenasy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom prepared a meal . She organized the kitchen and cut costs . She ' s the best of the five cooks we ' ve had . She ' s terrific . " <> <> Started at $250 a Week // Miss Volper was at first not sure she wanted the job , which paid only $250 a week ( just raised to $300 ) , and requires her to be on call five days a week , 24 hours a day . She is off weekends unless there is a special function . Other restrictions include having to live in the mansion in a basement bedroom . Friends may visit if they are expected in advance so their names can be left with security guards. // A native of Nassau County , Cindy Volper came to cooking in a roundabout way . After majoring in art at the New York State University College at Buffalo , she went to New Mexico to study sculpture . To earn money she worked in a restaurant owned by a woman who had attended the Culinary Institute . Inspired to enroll in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her real preference was for baking . " Working with dough is like working with clay , " she explained . " You can always tell by the feel when it is ready . And I also love to decorate. " // It was Albert Kumin , the extraordinary pastry chef lately of the White House and now a teacher at the Hyde Park school who urged Miss Volper to take the job at Gracie Mansion . He felt it would be a stepping stone . " I ' m not really so sure that the industry considers this such a terrific credential , but I listened to Albert anyway , " she said . " I think he ' s wonderful , and I ' m always calling him when something goes wrong . He never fails me. " // The other person Miss Volper calls for help is her mother , especially when Jewish recipes are required , as for a Passover seder . " In two years of school we had only one day on Jewish cooking , and I needed my mother ' s recipes for chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey cake. " // Miss Volper appreciates American food most and feels more attention should be paid to it . Her menus reflect the current practice of many young chefs who free-associate continental , Asian and American specialties , giving them a vegetarian look. // The lunch she served for a sample tasting was typical of those she sends down to City Hall for guests . It included a delicate chicken salad given crunch with finely minced almonds and walnuts , the Mayor ' s Caesar salad , heady with the garlic flavor that almost anesthetized one palate , a platter of simple cheeses decorated with an apple carved to resemble a chicken , and a kalei@doscopic fruit platter presented with a yogurt and honey dip scented with mace and cinnamon - a beautiful idea for dessert , but perhaps just a little bizarre when offered instead of crudites with wine , as the Mayor prefers it . Miss Volper ' s favorite apple tart , with its silken custard cream still gently warm from the oven , was dessert. // Cindy Volper ' s future plans include marriage to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hook up my workshop , " she said . In the workshop she plans to operate as a caterer , or to be a wholesale baker supplying quality restaurants . " And I ' m also thinking of going to school to study architecture - not only because I love school , but also because I may get tired of standing at a hot stove by the time I ' m 40 and then I can design restaurants. " // Often getting up as early as 4 : 30 A.M. to bake sweet rolls and cornbread for breakfasts , the pert , dark-haired , dark-eyed cook is often on duty through dinner , using the time between meals to plan future menus and shop . She regards the city ' s tight food budget as a challenge and is proud of doing breakfasts that cost for each person between 45 cents ( Tropicana orange juice , scrambled eggs , ordinary bacon and coffee ) and $1. 89 ( fresh fruit salad , eggs , or yogurt and fruit pancakes , homemade rolls and buns , Schaller &; Weber ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfactions with the job include the constant danger of adding pounds to her already gently rounded frame , the inefficiently arranged kitchen full of outdated equipment , plus the short notice she is often given for events . " I know that ' s part of the job but sometimes it ' s a nightmare , " Miss Volper said . " I can get a call at four in the afternoon saying there will be 100 people for dinner instead of 25 and in the same phone call I can be told there will be 10 people instead of two for breakfast the next morning . I scream a lot in this kitchen , but fortunately nobody hears me. " // Partial compensation is the Mayor ' s generous praise . " He also comes in and talks sometimes - never about politics - but he asks me what I have eaten in restaurants lately , or he describes something he has eaten and asks if I can make it , " Miss Volper said . And there is also the excitement of cooking for famous guests . " Leonard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she commented . " I would most like to cook for Anwar Sadat because I admire his courage . A few weeks ago I cooked for William Buckley Jr. and he seemed pleased. " // " Buckley was terrific , " said Ira Chelnick , another graduate of the Culinary Institute who is a chef and assists Miss Volper at large parties . " He has so much charisma , I might become a Republican , " Mr. Chelnick said. // " Shhhh ! No one should talk like that , " Miss Volper said . " Not in this house anyway. " //
