DURING THE REIGN OF THE QUEEN OF PERSIA <P> by Joan Chase <P> Harper &; Row ; 215 pages ; $13.95 <P> " The way Gram told it was that all I she had ever had in life was kids and work and useless men and what she wanted , and had earned besides , was to be left alone . " Time sweeps everything along in its great , slow spiral : Gram 's farm , Uncle Dan 's butcher shop , Celia 's beauty . People and houses move for a while with the current , then drop away to be replaced by hazy afterimages-family gossip , family myth . This musing , brooding , backward-looking novel , the author 's first , summons up scenes of middle-aged women huddling over coffee across a kitchen table , talking in murmurs not always audible . It recalls the memorable time when Katie , who must have been about ten , wriggled under the stall door at the railway station bathroom . " Anne tried to pull her back , then went after her , only she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . When Jenny came with the dime , they could n't get the door open , with Anne wedged under it , Katie still shoving her with her feet , just to be mean . " <P> The book also talks about the year Aunt Grace got cancer and Aunt Elinor mobilized everyone to read Christian Science literature . It retells stories long since drained of humor or sadness but not of their power as talismans , like stones found in childhood that still cause a tingle when discovered in a drawer and held in the hand . <P> The title is dreaming and distant and just right . In the rolling land of northern Ohio , during the middle years of the 20th century , a woman of no previous wealth inherited a hatful of money , bought a big house and some farm land and assumed matriarchal ways . This was Gram , who had five daughters and , though no one seemed to think the fact very important , a husband . Her style was regal-she would stomp out at night to play bingo whenever she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen of Persia . She sheltered , in her take-it-or-leave-it way , her unmarried daughters and whatever married ones happened , at any given moment , to have found their husbands redundant ( men are minor irritants in this matriarchy ) . <P> Four granddaughters of more or less the same age rowdied about the house . They were two sets of sisters whose personalities were distinct enough but who formed until midadolescence a tribe more formidable than any single member . The novel 's effective but highly unusual narrative voice reflects this collective consciousness . Scenes are related by " we , " never by " I. " When the reader notices this he may try to isolate a single speaker by elimination : Katie has crawled under the stall door , Anne is wedged there , and Jenny is looking for a dime , so it must be Celia . But no , we have established that it is not Celia . The speaker stays hidden , and her stubborn use of the first person plural makes the point that she and the others moved about the big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
