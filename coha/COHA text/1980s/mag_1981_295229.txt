THE ACTOR 'S NIGHTMARE AND SISTER MARY IGNATIUS EXPLAINS IT ALL FOR YOU <P> by Christopher Durang <P> Parody is Christopher Durang 's native element . He can mimic and spoof manners , trends and styles of speaking in ways that inflict the sting of truth just as surely as those of a good caricaturist . But Durang tends to end his plays unconvincingly , in a spasm of violence , as if he had been brooding on deeper things all along-like , say , man 's fate . It is as if the playwright as jester suddenly dropped his mask and wished to be acknowledged as a thinker . These two one-acters at Manhattan 's Playwrights Horizons Theater display both Durang 's virtues and his defects . <P> The Actor 's Nightmare is an In joke . The simple non-hero is named George Spelvin ( Jeff Brooks ) , a theatrical pseudonym for an actor playing a secondary role in a play . Spelvin has unaccountably wandered into stage company that he has never kept . The time is the present , but the other actors arbitrarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet and must go on tonight since " Eddie " has been injured in a car crash . <P> As the play-within-a-play begins , Spelvin enters dressed in black Renaissance garb , but the setting is a terrace of a posh hotel overlooking the harbor at Nice , and the first lines addressed to him are from Noel Coward 's Private Lives . The plots thicken and boil . Beckett 's Endgame and Happy Days are intermingled as well . With zany aplomb , Durang combines absurdist juxtapositions of lines and characters in Spelvin 's massive identity crisis . <P> In the play 's final sequence , Spelvin 's role is that of Sir Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons . For the first time , Spelvin is more than baffled . He feels a chill of apprehension , and rightly so , as he hears the stage directions : " The Executioner will be played by himself . " When the curtain rises on curtain calls , Spelvin does not . This mordant conclusion echoes that of Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead : Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with nary a clue as to its meaning and no aid from a Seeing-Eye God . <P> Durang shakes a stormier fist at God in Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You . Those who do not find the play abominably blasphemous ( and some may ) will find it damnably funny . The parody , this time , is of Roman Catholic elementary school education and , by extension . Catholic faith , dogma and practice . <P> Sister Mary Ignatius ( Elizabeth Franz ) has taught for many years at Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow school . She believes that to spare the rod is to spoil the child , perhaps eternally . Her rod is the catechism . Her prize pupil ( Mark Stefan ) can make pinpoint distinctions between venial and mortal sins . The sister pops a cookie into his mouth after each impeccable response , and Stefan plays the role with the precision of an ordained parrot . <P> In midplay a second parody begins . Four of the nun 's former students have come to perform a kind of Passion Play that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years at the school . The little troupe enacts the life of Christ from his birth in Bethlehem to his Crucifixion on Golgotha.
