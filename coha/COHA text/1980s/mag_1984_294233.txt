A TV series reopens old wounds <P> In terms of plot , the show is merely the stuff of any normal television soap opera : rape , plunder , anguish , despair . But the yearlong Japanese TV series Sanga Moyu is causing a real-life melodrama of its own . Based on a popular novel , Two Homelands by Toyoko Yamasaki , it is the story of the Japanese-American Amoh family , immigrants to the U.S. whose national loyalties are tested by World War II . The homeland they choose does not choose them , and the Amohs live through racist humiliation , imprisonment in a California relocation center and other indignities . The show has been so popular in Japan that its producers planned to offer it to Japanese-speaking Americans , but a controversy has arisen that may keep the series off U.S. TV . <P> Even before Sanga Moyu made its debut in Japan last January , there were grumbles among Japanese Americans , U.S. diplomats and Americans living in Japan . As early as last May , the Japanese Foreign Ministry received alarms from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans that dredging up the anti-Japanese hysteria of 1942 would damage relations between the two countries , especially at a time of friction over Japanese-American trade . Mike Masaoka , a longtime Washington public relations man whose clients include large Japanese firms and American companies doing business in Japan , pointed out in a letter to Japanese officials : " It could jeopardize good relations on all sides . Why add to a delicate situation ? " <P> In the U.S. an overwhelming wave of protest from Japanese Americans prompted the Japanese television network , Nippon Hoso Kyokai ( NHK ) , to postpone the American premiere of the series , originally scheduled for early March on Southern California 's Japanese-language TV . Some Japanese Americans see the program as a distortion of themselves and a threat to their own fortunes in the U.S. Most of the criticism has come from the 32,000-member Japanese American Citizens League , the oldest and largest Japanese civil rights group in the U.S. Sanga Moyu portrays a dilemma of divided patriotism that most Japanese Americans say does not exist . " There are no torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It gives a completely wrong impression . " Adds Floyd Shimomura , the organization 's president , " We spent three generations trying to prove our loyalties to the U.S.. I 'd hate to see a TV show undo all of that . " <P> To placate its critics , NHK added 16 episodes in the beginning of the series that provide a broad but dull view of modern Japanese history starting in 1936 . In these segments the militarists prior to Pearl Harbor are depicted as deceptive , conniving scoundrels . NHK executives have even produced a pamphlet that outlines the changes made in the book 's original story line , ones that improve the American image . The television version , they say , will enhance mutual understanding : instead of just dealing with unfortunate experiences , it will also show American good will and humane treatment of Japanese Americans . Says NHK Drama Director Ryo Okino : " Many of those who are protesting are doing so on the basis of the book , but we have made many changes .
