It used to be the most feared of all PACs . The National Conservative PAC ( NCPAC ) , known as " Nickpac , " mounted a series of harsh negative advertising campaigns in 1980 that it insists were responsible for defeating Democratic Senators George McGovern of South Dakota , Frank Church of Idaho , Birch Bayh of Indiana and John Culver of Iowa . In the heady aftermath , NCPAC grandly announced that it planned to shoot down 20 more liberal Senators in 1982 . But NCPAC 's aim has proved less deadly than thought , and its guns are beginning to backfire . NCPAC is now heavily involved in only five Senate races , and its preferred candidates are generally disavowing any connection with the group . <P> Maryland Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes , who is on the receiving end of a $650,000 NCPAC attack , has made the organization 's tactics a major issue in the campaign . His success in running against NCPAC has frustrated his real opponent , Republican Lawrence Hogan . In a televised debate last week , after Sarbanes again tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his arms and declared : " I hereby denounce NCPAC ! " Says Hogan 's campaign manager , George Nesterczuk : " They 've certainly provided Sarbanes with a convenient issue to run on . " <P> Of the $10 million NCPAC will raise for 1982 , $4 million will go for negative propaganda unauthorized by any candidate , $1.5 million will be donated directly to candidates , and the rest will go for maintaining its expensive direct-mail lists and other administrative costs . A similar PAC , North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms ' Congressional Club , will raise another $10 million . <P> Despite their difficulties , the New Right PACs remain ready to get out the brass knuckles when the stakes are high . Last week , with the Senate race in California between Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Pete Wilson becoming very close ( the latest poll shows them almost even ) , the Fund for a Conservative Majority announced plans for a $250,000 negative ad campaign against Brown .                  @ @ @
