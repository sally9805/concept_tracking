When her first TV series debuted on Oct. 15 , 1951 , there was no way to tell that Lucille Ball was beginning an apparently immortal love affair with the American public , and not much reason even to expect commercial success . Ball was a comely redhead with a semisultry voice and knockout legs , but she was also nearly 40 and a veteran of almost two decades in the supporting ranks of show business . She had been a movie actress but hardly a superstar ; she had enjoyed moderate success in radio but had only fleeting experience in the new medium of video . She refused to move from the West Coast to New York City , where nearly all shows then originated , and she insisted on co-starring her husband , an obscure bandleader whose Cuban syntax was so conspicuous that his dressing room featured the sign ENGLISH BROKEN HERE . <P> Nothing , in short , about her prior career hinted that she could be as deft and daring as Harold Lloyd , as rubber-faced as Bert Lahr , as touching as Chaplin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other foremost icon of the ' 50s Golden Age of TV , Jackie Gleason , Ball was a larger-than-life talent uniquely suited to the small screen . Her signature series , I Love Lucy , and its successors endured more than two decades in prime time , from 1951 to 1974 , one of the few immutables in a sea of social change . Lucy , seen in more than 80 countries and in perpetual reruns in the U.S. , has a cumulative audience in the tens of billions . <P> The daughter of a Jamestown , N.Y. , electrician , Ball left home at 15 to study acting in New York City . Although she started as a model and chorus-line beauty , she never lost touch with the insecure , self-conscious adolescent inside her and seemed most at ease when playing a zany or a frump . Her great creation was the Lucy character , a Little Scamp who was forever conniving , forever failing , forever meriting punishment yet winning forgiveness . The thwarted schemer was a figure dating back to the Romans if not the Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunning intellect with joyously low physical comedy and , perhaps most important , feminized it . Her shows  --  I Love Lucy , The Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz Show , The Lucy Show and Here 's Lucy  --  reflected the major post-World War II social trends , from the baby boom to the exodus to the suburbs to the democratization of travel . <P> Their foremost concern was the yearning of one redheaded Everywoman to get out of the kitchen and into a job and then , once employed , to emerge from beneath the boss 's thumb . She endured any indignity in search of her big chance . The greatest indignity of all , it generally turned out , was the chuckling condescension of her husband Ricky , played by her real-life husband and business partner Desi Arnaz . The confident king of the castle , he was always ready to teach Lucy a lesson . Looking back from an ' 80s perspective , some observers have suggested that Lucy was virtually an abused wife . In retrospect , Ball might have agreed . Certainly , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking , philandering and intense workaholism.
