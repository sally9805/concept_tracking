He is well acquainted with unbe  --  lievers , jeering cynics  --  and faint-hearted friends . His whole life has been a great challenge , an in  --  vitation to skepticism . Yet he stands today in the midst of his $250-mi1 ? lion university campus , facing his $150-million-plus City of Faith med  --  ical complex , proclaiming that God is going to make it possible for him and his colleagues to achieve some of the breakthroughs that will lead to a cure for cancer . As a teenager , dying of tubercu  --  losis , he prayed and others prayed  --  and God healed him . During his childhood , he was a stutterer whom other boys taunted unmercifully . But his mother told him that someday God would heal his tongue and that he would become a preacher . He has indeed be  --  come one of the most famous preachers of the century and , through television , is heard by millions Sunday after Sunday , around the world . Oral Roberts insists that far more than mere mortal ambi  --  tions are involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takable commands that God has communicated to him . Anyone who talks in such sim  --  ple , assured terms in this unbelieving age is bound to be greeted with doubts and deri  --  sion  --  and so it has been with Roberts . None of that , how  --  ever , has kept him from get  --  ting on with the work he feels he has been called to do , in  --  cluding the building of the Ci  --  ty of Faith  --  and the search for a cure for cancer . What he has already accom  --  plished , with the help of all of his partners far and near , can only be called a series of miracles . Not that Roberts is surprised . He believes that God is the source of miracles for everybody  --  but not through any easy magic or divine whim . Miracles , he is convinced , come through prayer and faith and plenty of hard follow-up to the praying and believing . Roberts ' own brushes with the miraculous have recurred many times over the 65 years of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dreaded disease , escape from a would-be assassin 's near-miss bul  --  let . That latter miracle , in a revival tent on the north side of Tulsa at the beginning of his evangelistic ministry in 1947 , brought him na  --  tional attention and multiplied the crowds that flocked to hear him . The very nature of his ministry , its emphasis upon healing by faith , brought countless reports of phys  --  ical miracles . It also brought charges of deception , fraud and cruel exploitation of the sick , the crippled and the dying . The media had a field day with him , as they have had with many others who combine preach  --  ing , praying and healing . Oral Roberts has always in  --  sisted that he has no personal power to heal anyone . But he always declared that through prayer and genuine faith true healing did occur , even for the most hopeless of cases  --  and that they could occur today as they had in the time of Jesus . Although some doctors at  --  tacked him as an antiscience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief in the medical sciences and his con  --  viction that all healings come from God , whoever and what  --  ever the instruments may be . Throughout his ministry he has had working partnerships with physicians and medical specialists who have seen him not as a fraud , or a threat to their profession , but as an ac  --  cepted ally . It is that kind of teamwork , involving top  --  flight medicine combined with dedicated , prayerful belief , that lies at the foundation of The City of Faith hospital and medical-research complex . The old media caricature of Oral Roberts as an ignorant , freakish " faith healer " has gradually faded away . Enduring periods of hostile treatment by the media and other critics , he long ago determined not to answer back . He has n't once an  --  swered back . Today the problem is something different . Now the central problem is the old business of answering the eternal skeptics who keep saying : " It ca n't be done . " Oral Roberts University and the City of Faith are tangible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of hard work and giving . Consider the university . Long be  --  fore construction began in 1962 , Oral Roberts was seized with the idea of starting a new university rooted in the Christian faith . He shared that vision with members of his family and picked out the farm  --  land beyond the edge of town . He told one of his young evangelistic associates , Carl Hamilton , to go earn a Ph.D . so he would have the proper credentials to run an institution still to be chartered . Roberts ' most important credentials are a quick mind , a passion for learning , great curiosity and great powers of communication  --  and enor  --  mous dedication , faith and will . In building his university from scratch , he did not have the backing of a church de  --  nomination , although he is a Methodist and has the good  --  will of that denomination . He was not bankrolled by some multimillionaire . And his home city already had the respected University of Tulsa . Nonetheless , his success in raising money to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various educational programs has been phenomenal . The money came largely from the huge following his ministry had developed over the years . The state of Oklahoma issued an official charter for ORU in 1963 . Undergraduate classes began in 1965 . And in 1971 , full accredita  --  tion was conferred by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools . In 1975 a school of nursing was created and graduate schools in theology and business administra  --  tion were started . Schools of den  --  tistry and medicine got under way in 1978 . A school of law followed in 1979 . Meanwhile , graduate pro  --  grams in a number of traditional academic disciplines are going forward and master 's degrees are being awarded . In time , ORU expects to be accredited to grant the Ph.D . Along the way , a handsome , functional physical plant has been constructed and paid for . There are 22 buildings of compatible " futur  --  istic " design , their vertical beams pointing heavenward . All class  --  rooms are equipped with closed-circuit television capabilities , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oral Rob  --  erts has proven to be a practical ad  --  ministrator . He insisted from the beginning on a pay-as-we-go ap  --  proach to the expansion of plant and staff . Except for a few student dormitories financed with low-interest government loans , ORU buildings have been built as the contributions came in . He also excels in two other quali  --  ties much sought after in good ex  --  ecutives . He is skilled at building an administrative team and in delegating authority to key staff associates . But back of all that skill lies his gift for in  --  spiring faith in the great things he is convinced God has com  --  manded him and his team to accomplish . Of all the Roberts visions , the most unlikely dream has surely been the huge , ultramod  --  ern comprehensive-health  --  service and medical-research complex . This City of Faith idea came to Roberts in the wake of a family tragedy  --  the death of his eldest daughter Rebecca and her husband Marshall in a plane crash . In search of peace and relief from his grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a message came through to him loud and clear . In part , it was a repetition of the call he had experienced 30 years earlier when he had felt under orders to enter into a ministry of healing those sick in body , mind and soul . In essence , it was a command to create a " new and different medical center " where " the healing streams of prayer and medicine must merge , " where " every physician , every nurse , every person praying must be in harmony . . . in the heal  --  ing ministry . " Tied into this vision was a message to undertake a major re  --  search effort to " help find a cure for cancer and other death-dealing diseases . " The message was accom  --  panied by a detailed mental image of a huge three-towered structure to be built in one sustained planning and construction effort . There is no point in detail  --  ing all the arguments and man  --  made barriers that immediate  --  ly arose , but here is a sam  --  pling : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be prohibitive ; you ca n't raise that much money . ORU is just getting under way with its medical school ; now is no time to launch so grandiose a plan for a hospital . Medical re  --  search ought to be reserved for established , prestigious scien  --  tific institutions . Despite all discourage  --  ments , in 1978 ground was broken for The City of Faith . In 1981 the first phase of the center was opened . Stage by stage the work continues . Meanwhile , media-fanned rumors circulate that the research center is a hollow shell , that the hospital beds are mostly empty , that there is not enough money on hand to complete the buildings and to launch various programs . All true , in part  --  and all , essentially , false . The reality is that on the 80 acres set aside on the edge of the 500-acre ORU campus , rising above all the other structures , stand three strik  --  ing , interconnected towers , the cen  --  tral one 60 stories tall . All are partly finished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases of the complex would be fin  --  ished and fully utilized at once . The pay-as-we-go philosophy of Oral Roberts dictates that the project proceed as the financing is avail  --  able . At the same time , his sense of urgency has demanded that as many services as possible should start , even in unfinished buildings . The City of Faith hospital is a 30-story tower with patients ' rooms grouped in two-floor units around an atrium . Each of these areas has its own lounge , central control station and prayer chapel . There is al  --  so a nurses ' alcove for every six patients . Each room has been planned and furnished to be as comfort  --  able , efficient and pleasing to the eye as possible . All floors are carpeted . Walls , curtains , bedspreads and carpets are in soft , blending colors . Bedside cabinets , telephones , light switches and television con  --  trols have been designed and located for maximum patients ' conve  --  nience . Some rooms have couches that can be converted into beds for overnight family visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pa  --  tient should be a dominant consid  --  eration is reflected in many ways . One homely symbol of that concern is the design of patients ' gowns . No more of those floppy garments split down the back , held together by hard-to-reach ties . The new City of Faith hospital gowns are slit along their sides , easy to fasten  --  and cover the traditionally exposed bottoms ! Every room has a television mounted on the wall beyond the foot of the bed . The controls are at hand for the patient lying down . In addition to the regular fare , special programming is available . It is in  --  formational and inspirational , in  --  cluding a reassuring film that ex  --  plains to patients just what to expect and the kind of recuperative care they will receive . Other striking facts about the hospital : all the nurses are R.N. 's ; 83 percent of the rooms are private ; and the food is good . Food is prepared in a central kitchen , but it is moved quick  --  ly by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutrition center " on each floor , the cold food kept chilled and hot food hot . Oth  --  er foods and juices can be prepared by the floor nurses . Along with all the personal attention that is the hallmark of the City of Faith hospital , the most advanced " state of the art " technology helps the doctors and nurses do their work efficiently . All the pa  --  tients ' records , for example , are fed into the central com  --  puter and can be called up in  --  stantly on terminals in the floor-control centers and in each nurses ' alcove . The doc  --  tor making his rounds always has quick access to all the in  --  formation about each patient 's background , medical record and current chart . An ingenious telelift system speeds the delivery of supplies and medicines to every point in the hospital in less than six minutes , greatly reducing the time nurses have traditionally spent running such errands . The radiology department has the latest X-ray equipment and high  --  speed film , which reduce radiation dosage by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cat-scan " equipment by acquiring a new magnetic resonance scanner that gives a comprehensive look at what is going on inside the body with no radiation danger at all . The hospital lab is equipped with a Technicon 11-6000 Continuous Flow Instru  --  ment ? that can do complete blood counts at the rate of one test tube per minute . Some critics continue to say , as they did from the beginning , " Tulsa does n't need more hospitals . Oral Roberts will never fill that place . " But over the long haul , it is expected that only about 10 percent of the pa  --  tients will be local people . The Oral Roberts ministries are nationwide and worldwide : people who listen to his sermons , read his 50 books and write and call in to tell Roberts and his team their problems . These are the very people who are sending their financial contributions to make all this possible . They will make up the bulk of the patient population . Oral Roberts , chief executive Jim Wins  --  low and their colleagues intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without boasting , but also without apology , they say they will make the City of Faith " the Mayo Clinic of the Southwest " ? with an unsur  --  passed religious support system . They have similar high aspi  --  rations for the research center . But , obviously , it comes later on the development timetable . As this is written , it is a 20-story building , with much finishing work to be done on the inside , most of the equip  --  ment yet to be installed and many of the staff members still to be recruited . Roberts has no illusions about the re  --  sources it will take to do the high-quality scientific work on which he will insist . Meanwhile , the largest , most-used , yet emptiest part of the whole complex is the 60-story central tower that houses the clinic , the continuing education facilities , administrative offices  --  and a one-seventh-mile in  --  door running track . People are com  --  ing for tests , examinations and out  --  patient treatment every day . Many are coming as simple curious visi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City of Faith have al  --  ready become perhaps the leading tourist attractions in Oklahoma . A lecture hall , orientation films and all the other facilities such attractions require have been provided in the central tower . Soon this handsome and comfortable building will be utilized for conferences , fitness clinics and related activities . Before the City of Faith was con continued on page 97 A Background For Healing " I do n't focus on how a person gets well , " explains Oral Roberts . " My concern is simply that he gets healed . Whether through the instru  --  ment of medicine or the instrument of prayer , or both working together ? God is still the source for all heal ? . ing . " Roberts tells his audiences he has good reason to believe in the heal  --  ing power of faith . As a skeptical teenager , he says , he was healed of tuberculosis and lifelong stuttering through the ministrations of a fiery evangelist at a tent meeting . While playing in a basketball tournament , Roberts had suddenly collapsed , blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was told he had tuberculosis , the disease that had taken two aunts on his mother 's side as well as his Cherokee grandfather , aged 50 . TB had been the scourge of the Okla  --  homa Indian reservations . At that time there was no cure . " You just got it and died , " says Roberts . The papers that would put him in a TB sanatorium in eastern Oklahoma were prepared . Meanwhile , the hemorrhaging had sapped his strength . At 17 , bed  --  fast and apparently dying , he found himself confronted by his father , his mother and a nurse kneeling at his side in prayer . His father , a preacher , was concerned for Rob continued on page 110 with Earthworm . " " Most interesting , " I said . And it may interest you , Hender  --  son , to know that as soon as I got back to the hotel here in Philadel  --  phia I mailed the briefcase to Mr. Quackenbush , with an anonymous note asking him to send for his silly excavator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sending you the tainted $5000 . With your refined sense of ethics you will know better than I what to do with it . All best wishes , Alexander Botts ill Oral Roberts continued from page 45 strutted , the ORU Medical School was launched . How does it fit into this great complex ? And how is it doing ? A medical school is a high-risk enterprise . Rare is the university that dares establish one . The answer is that the ORU Medi  --  cal School seems to be doing fine . It graduated its first class in 1982 . Its enrollment is expanding on sched  --  ule . Its program is accredited provi  --  sionally , which gives it as much offi  --  cial professional validation as a new institution can have at this stage . An eminent physician , who serves on the accreditation team and as dean of a highly respected medical school , gives the ORU program high marks . Based upon the public 's per  --  ception of Oral Roberts as a tele  --  vision preacher-evangelist , this out  --  side critic-observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a university , a law school , a nursing school , a dental school or a medical school . He has done just that , and he has not spared any ef  --  fort to make it in every regard first rate . I have n't looked at the other programs , but in medicine and grad  --  uate-school efforts he has succeeded beyond our wildest hopes and has really done a remarkable job . " That is the judgment of a secular scientist who would not be num  --  bered among Oral Roberts ' tradi  --  tional constituency . But maybe he is getting drawn in . He said , " What Oral Roberts provides is compre  --  hensive medicine plus comprehen  --  sive family and life counseling  --  and of course the spiritual aspect  --  and it is just really outstanding . " As Oral Roberts looks back on 35 years of preaching and praying and working and dreaming , as he looks // around him and looks ahead , how does he see all this ? " When I began , it was to take God 's healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all health is God . A doctor is an instrument , his medicines are an instrument , his surgery is an instrument . He ca n't heal anybody , but as an instrument he can cooperate with God , the source of all healing , and God will bring healing . I pray for the sick and I ca n't heal anybody . My prayers can not heal anybody , but if God uses my prayers as an instrument , then that prayer has value . What we are trying to do here is to be the best instruments we can learn to be , to combine the best of medicine that is available and the most devoted and caring prayers we can send forth , so that as His instruments we can help do His work by bringing healing of body , mind and spirit to a sick world . " Oral Roberts , his university and the new City of Faith are already powerful instruments to help a world that needs all the healing that it can get . Get Out Of Town continued from page 55 house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kins , whom I 'd never seen touch a gun before . " Good afternoon . " It was ma who opened the ball and I was proud of her . " It 's nice of you to call . Will you gentlemen get down and come in ? I 've some cold lemonade . " It was a mighty hot after  --  noon and there was n't a man in the outfit would n't have sold his saddle for a good cold drink , but Sheriff Russell spoke up . " Ma'am " ? he was real brusque as always ? " we 've come to ask you to get rid of this troublemaker you 've hired . You 're to fire him . " Ma smiled , and like Riley said , ma was a right pretty woman . Thing was , ma came of an old Virginia family and she had the dig  --  nity that came of it . She smiled mighty sweet , but there was a chill in it too . " I am afraid , Sheriff , that I do not quite understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hire whom I wish ? Upon just what law are you basing this  --  this order ? " Russell was n't used to being talked up to . He was a hard old man who was used to being kowtowed to . Some of the men behind him kind of shifted in their saddles and looked uncomfortable . Ma was a real lady and they all knew it . " This man 's a troublemaker ! " Russell 's face was showing his anger . " He 's ? " " What trouble has he made ? I was n't aware he had been off the place , and am sure he has not . " " That 's neither here nor there . " " Will you name an instance , Sheriff ? You accuse him of being a troublemaker . What has he done ? " Russell was flabbergasted , and I never looked to see the day . He had brought all those men who did business with the Coopers out here to lend weight to his demand for Riley 's being fired . It was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real stubborn streak .

" What is more to the point , Sheriff , Johnny Loftus and Ed Shif  --  rin were on my range today , threat  --  ening my son and Mr. Riley . I want them arrested for trespass and put under bond . " Russell was really mad now . Nothing was going like he planned , and the worst of it was , Rafe Cadieux chuckled . The sheriff turned on Riley . " You get out of town or I 'll have you in jail !

If he 'll meet me there in person and tell me to leave , I 'll go . " Those days , folks did n't have many amusements .
