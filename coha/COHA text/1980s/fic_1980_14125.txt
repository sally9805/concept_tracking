The porch of a log house , facing us straight on . A young woman in a homespun dress stands nursing a baby and gazing out over the slopes . She sees someone , and waves . MARY Whoo  --  oo ! VOICES ( Offstage ) Whoo  --  oo ! Mary nurses her baby , sings to it . She makes a face , wincing as the baby 's gums pinch her nipple , then she smiles again . Enter Hershel , her husband , and Cardell , her son , carrying axes . They are hot and tired . MARY Well , it 's about time . HERSHEL We 're here , ai n't we ? The men drop their axes , stretch , and go to a bucket sitting on the porch . They reach in it and throw water on their faces . Hershel mops his face with a kerchief . His son does the same . MARY Oh , goodness me . Just so tired and all wore out . I bet you both been laying on the creek bank thinking about supper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? You go out into the world . You get yourself some land , a house and a wife . Then you keep careful note of ever minute in the day , because you 're going to account for ever damn one . Yes , ma'am . That 's it . We been laying on the creek bank , counting clouds . p. 3 MARY I ai n't surprised . HERSHEL How about you ? We going to watch you feed that baby all night , or do we get something to eat , too ? MARY There might be something in the pot for you , if you do n't ask for it too often . Ouch . Ow-ee ! Baby , go easy on me ! Ow ! HERSHEL Eating you up , is he ? Well , why not ? MARY You 'd know why not , you had him pulling on you . There now . Shoo . That 's better . All right , supper 's ready . Come on . HERSHEL Hold it . Take a seat . MARY What ? HERSHEL Take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to sit here and watch the sun go down . Supper can wait . MARY I never heard you say that before . Cardell , what 's wrong with your father ? CARDELL I do n't know . Feeling good , I reckon . HERSHEL That 's it . I 'm feeling good . Sit . They sit in slat chairs . Hershel props his feet on a crate , fills a pipe . He is suddenly relaxed , expansive , thinking about something that is important to him . They sit for a while.So tell your mother what we did today . CARDELL We girdled a stand of them tulip trees . I still say we did n't notch them deep enough , though . p. 4 HERSHEL Oh , yes , we did . Just so the bark 's cut through , they 'll die . And come down dry wood . We 'll have us a new porch and a whole new floor , with boards that wo n't warp . What about that , Mary ? MARY That 'll be all right . HERSHEL Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming along . Four years a-groaning and sweating on another man 's land , and now we got our own . This here is our estate , you know that ? Be yours , Cardell , one day , if you want it . And the baby 's . ' Cept it 'll look different then . I aim to build out this porch half again as wide . How about that ? MARY That 'll be nice . HERSHEL I aim to cut into that brush yonder and add it to my slope field . Then we can look out over fifty damn acres . All of it cleared . All of it ours . How about that , by God ? MARY Ai n't you hungry , yet ? HERSHEL Yeah , I 'm hungry ! Hungry for what 's mine ! And I got it , too ! It cost me , but I got it . MARY Hush . Cost you what ? HERSHEL The getting of it . Not so easy . Your son can tell you about that . He 's commencing to want his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that , worry about it . He 'll pay for it , just like I have . Yes , you will , Cardell . Son , you 're getting about the age now where you and me are looking slantwise at each other . I notch a tulip tree , and you stand there thinking how much better you could do it yourself . That right ? p. 5 CARDELL I did n't mean nothing about them trees . HERSHEL The hell you did n't ! MARY Hershel . Do n't swear at the children . HERSHEL But that 's all right , son . That 's the way it ought to be . That 's the way you 'll get your estate . Pretty soon here , you 'll get fed up with the way I do things . Turn red about to bust wanting them your own way . You 'll say no , and I 'll say yes , and I 'll say yes , and you 'll say no , and then you wo n't give a damn what I say . And that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you can go , Cardell , you can go . Understand ? MARY All right , wise grandpa . Enough of this . Supper 's ready . HERSHEL Stay right where you are ! Look at this estate ! Drop a penny in that ground , and grow yourself half a dollar . North Carolina bottom land ! Whoo-pee ! MARY I declare , Hershel . What 's got into you ? HERSHEL Satisfaction 's got into me ! I 'm taking time to think about it ! House , land , a new baby , a son standing up to me like he should , a wife with sore tits but otherwise all right  --  MARY I certainly am glad I 'm otherwise all right , Hershel . You took a big load off my mind . p. 6 HERSHEL Yeah . I growed up crawling over a dirt floor in a shack , like a God damned ant . Going to work with my daddy , Cardell , for a man lived in a big white house on a hill . People up there in the shade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do this and fetch that , me getting hauled about and swore at . Then , when I got just big enough to tell my daddy , enough of this , having to go serve in the God damned Confederate Army . So I crawled some more and got hauled around and swore at some more . Ended up lying in a pine forest watching shells set them pines on fire . Men scared to death , running ever which way , and me , lying there waiting to fry like a piece of bacon , thinking , I 'll never get out , never . MARY But you did . HERSHEL Yeah , I did . A cowbell is heard , ringing not far away. I ai n't there no more . I 'm where I dreamed I 'd be , someday . The cowbell is heard again.On my estate , by God ! I got it ! And it 's mine ! The cowbell rings again , closer . MARY Well , you can enjoy it on an empty stomach , if you have to keep on bragging . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more wood . I got to heat everything up again . HERSHEL Never mind , son . You just sit there and think about what you want in this life , too . I 'll go get the damn wood . How about that ? p. 7 MARY Hershel , that will be right nice . Exit Hershel in the yard , and Mary into the house . Cardell sits dreaming , thinking about his father . The cowbell is heard again , much closer . Cardell looks up . A light flashes in his face , making him blink . It plays about him , a strange reflection of the afternoon sun , jumping about . He covers his face , blinks . He shades his eyes , stands , and looks out into the brush . Enter the bent figure of an Old Woman . Her dress is ragged and torn . Her white hair , unbound , is stringy and wild . She carries a cowbell in one hand , ringing it . In the other hand , she carries a piece of shattered mirror glass , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . She stares at Cardell . OLD WOMAN Did n't expect to see me . Did you ? CARDELL Who 're you ? OLD WOMAN What ? CARDELL I said , who are you ? OLD WOMAN Where 's everybody else ? Where 'd they go to ? CARDELL What ? OLD WOMAN Wait . Hold on . Let me figure something out . You 're just a boy . Do you live here ? CARDELL Yes , I do . OLD WOMAN Since when ? p. 8 CARDELL Since a year ago . My daddy bought this place a year ago . OLD WOMAN Who form ? CARDELL Nobody . From the county , I think . There was some old man living here , but he died . He did n't have nobody to leave it to , so it was for sale . OLD WOMAN What was his name ? CARDELL Larman . OLD WOMAN I know that . I mean his first name . CARDELL Abner , I think it was . Wait a minute , you can ask my daddy . Exit Cardell , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the house . She gazes into the piece of mirror . She laughs . She drops the piece of mirror on the ground . She looks at the house again , studies it . She rings her cowbell . Enter Mary , carrying the baby . MARY Listen now . Enough of this . Put that cowbell down and come on in to supper  --  ( She sees the Old Woman ) Oh . OLD WOMAN Well , I guess that 's that . She laughs . Enter Hershel , with wood , and Cardell with him . HERSHEL Do n't get so excited , son . Where  --  He sees the Old Woman . They stand staring at her . She chuckles and rings her bell , and stares right back at them . p. 9 OLD WOMAN Heh , heh . MARY Hershel , say something to her . Hershel puts down his load of wood , approaches her cautiously . HERSHEL How do you do ? OLD WOMAN Hidy . HERSHEL What can we do for you ? OLD WOMAN Nothing . You ca n't do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , then . Uh  --  OLD WOMAN This here your boy ? HERSHEL Yes . OLD WOMAN He says you bought this place from a man named Abner Larman . HERSHEL I bought this house , and fifty acres , yes . But I bought it from the county . Mr. Larman died here all alone . OLD WOMAN All alone , you say ? That figures . Fifty acres , you say ? HERSHEL Right . OLD WOMAN You got cheated . There was over seventy . HERSHEL How do you know that ? OLD WOMAN Never mind . It has been pleasant talking to you . She rings her cowbell , and starts off . p. 10 MARY Hershel , she 's so old . It 's getting dark , and she ai n't got no light . She 'll fall down . Ought'n we to do something ? HERSHEL Yeah . Let me see . ( He catches up with her ) Ma'am ! Just a minute ! OLD WOMAN Yeah ? HERSHEL Do n't you want to come sit with us a minute ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near here ? OLD WOMAN ( Laughing ) Oh , yes ! I live near here . About seven miles , over the mountain . That 's close . HERSHEL You got somebody waiting on you hereabouts ? OLD WOMAN Nobody 's waiting for me nowhere , mister . MARY Come sit with us , then . HERSHEL You look tired out . OLD WOMAN I do feel a mite puny . Hershel leads the Old Woman up onto the porch , and seats her in his chair . She holds onto her cowbell . HERSHEL Like something to eat ? Mary ? MARY I got some spoonbread you might like . OLD WOMAN Sounds good . Got any tea ? MARY I brew boneset tea . Want some of that ? p. 11 OLD WOMAN Boneset . I made it myself , once . Here . I 'll help you . ( She tries to get up , but slips back in the chair ) MARY Stay right there . I 'll bring it out to you . Cardell , take the baby , and come on with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woman smiles , nods , and rocks in the chair . Pause . OLD WOMAN So . HERSHEL You say you live seven miles from here ? OLD WOMAN ( Nodding and thinking ) In Tennessee . HERSHEL Oh . ( Pause ) You know , I thought the Tennessee border was a good eighty miles over the mountains there . OLD WOMAN So did I. HERSHEL You sure you live in Tennessee ? OLD WOMAN That is the only thing in this world I am sure of , mister . I live in Tennessee , all right . HERSHEL No wonder you 're tired , then , walking all the way from Tennessee . OLD WOMAN Only seven miles . ( Laughs ) Figure it out . I ca n't . HERSHEL Where 'd you stay last night ? p. 12 OLD WOMAN Well , let me see . Oh , I found a stand of pines , and went in and lay down . Pulled the needles up around me . Dry , mostly . I was cold , but I slept . No , wait . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream I knowed from a long time ago , it seemed . Comes down the mountain undercutting the rock . Sand underneath . Dry again . Slept there . Made me a gig out of a hickory stick . Had frog legs for breakfast . HERSHEL You 're on a trip of some kind ? OLD WOMAN That 's right . HERSHEL Where you heading ? OLD WOMAN Back to Tennessee , now . HERSHEL I mean , where were you heading ? OLD WOMAN Here , mister . Right here . Enter Mary , with a bowl of spoonbread , and a jug of tea . MARY You see if this do n't do you some good . OLD WOMAN Nice people . Nice people . She eats and drinks . Hershel and Mary move aside to talk . Cardell , holding the baby , comes onto the porch and watches the Old Woman . MARY Hershel , what are we goind to do with her ? She 's too old just to let walk out into the night . p. 13 HERSHEL I know . She can stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy ? HERSHEL She 's a mite something . I almost got her to say who she is and all , but not quite . She slept on the ground last night , and the night before that . She gigs frogs . MARY How old you think she is ? HERSHEL Hard to say . I suspect she was a handsome woman once . MARY When Cardell seen her , he said she had some kind of a flashing thing in her hand . HERSHEL Flashing thing ? MARY Said she was grinning at him , and it was like she was holding a star in one hand . HERSHEL She 's something else , all right . The Old Woman finishes her meal . She seems stronger . OLD WOMAN Listen , that was good . You ought not to boil the boneset so much , but it was good anyhow . MARY I 'm glad you liked it . HERSHEL You feel better ? OLD WOMAN Well , of course . I had me a good meal , on this porch . Sure I feel better . HERSHEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , to this house ? All the way from Tennessee ? p. 14 OLD WOMAN That 's what I said . I see you put in new post beams . Some of this flooring is all different . Not much of a job , though . You do it ? HERSHEL Did the beams , not the flooring . I reckon Abner Larman did that . OLD WOMAN No . Ab would n't bother . It must have been Billy . I suppose he 's dead , too . HERSHEL Billy ? OLD WOMAN Poppa 's joy . He was always the one . It would have been him . He put the first floor in with Poppa , when we built this place . Ab cared about the farm , not the house . And I guess lasted longest , died last of all , in the house . Well , all except me . You know , mister , this here estate of yours , it ai n't rightfully yours at all . It 's mine . HERSHEL What ? I got the deed , lady ! OLD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fume . Think everybody wants what you got . Sit still , I ai n't no bandit . You 're welcome to it , this here estate of yours . HERSHEL God damn right it 's mine . MARY Hershel . OLD WOMAN Men . How old you think I am ? Come on . Guess . MARY We were wondering . I ca n't tell . Sometimes you look right young . p. 15 OLD WOMAN Nice people . Sometimes a pea will shrink so tight it 's smooth . I 'm the same age as my tongue , and a little older than my teeth . Comfort me . Guess . Mister ? HERSHEL Sixty-five ? OLD WOMAN I 'll never see that again . Way off . Son ? CARDELL Two hundred . OLD WOMAN Whoa now . Do n't kill me . I got a little time left . ( To Mary ) How about you ? MARY I would say you are either nineteen or ninety . OLD WOMAN Nineteen or ninety ! That 's comfort . You hit it . Nineteen or ninety . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the porch . She stands in the yard , facing out , speaking to the family on the porch directly behind her ) When I was nineteen . I stood right here . Right where I 'm standing now . And I was n't no shriveled-up pea then . I was a choice item . The best-looking woman in these mountains . And the meanest . Mean and proud . Damn men . I did n't like ' em . Said so . Drove Momma crazy . You 're wild , she said . Settle down . Like you ? I said . Marry when you 're a child . Work and slave for men who do n't care one spit what you think or how you feel . Who never listen . Do n't talk like that , Momma said , but I did . I give men hell . They 'd come , and I 'd spit , and they 'd go . You did n't like it , either . You , you up there . You did n't . ( She is speaking to the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are her own ) Ab and Billy . Rachel and Poppa . Momma . You do n't know what to do , do you ? You just sit there , shake your heads . Watch me fight . Damn men . ( She stands straighter . She strokes her white hair ) Heavy-footed , tongue-tied , bug-eyed horsefaces , coming here looking for a slave . Wanting to lie on top of me one minute , and work me to death the next . And take me away from you . And you hoping one of them would . Clucking your tongues , saying , " Lands sakes , what will become of her , treating men like this . " Wanting me to go . Well , I wo n't ! I wo n't leave this house , and you , to be plowed under like dirt by some sweating , groaning , boneheaded man ! Hell , no ! ( She stares offstage . She sees someone coming ) And then , he came by . Griswold Plankman , the joke of the world . He came my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Larman . Mrs. Larman . Billy . ( Pause ) Miss Larman .

GRISWOLD Well  --  OLD WOMAN And what fine land it is , all eight acres of it . GRISWOLD Well  --  OLD WOMAN Now if I wait here a few days , you 'll wonder how come I know so much about you . I know enough , Griswold Plankman . You 're too poor to paint , and too proud to whitewash . GRISWOLD Well  --  OLD WOMAN I 'd sure like to buy you for what you 're worth , and sell you for what you think you 're worth . I can look right through you , and a little piece on the other side . GRISWOLD Well  --  OLD WOMAN Get it straight , Griswold . We are as different as cheese from chalk . To speak plainly , as far as I am concerned , you are as ugly as homemade sin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Griswold smiles and shakes his head . p. 17 GRISWOLD You know what made the river angry ? It got crossed to many times . ( He laughs ) OLD WOMAN Huh ? GRISWOLD You know why lightning shocks people ? It do n't know how to conduct itself . ( He laughs ) OLD WOMAN Oh , my God . GRISWOLD When is a door not a door ? When it 's ajar . ( He laughs ) OLD WOMAN Man , this is pitiful . Will you just shut up ? GRISWOLD Why is a pig the strangest of all animals ? OLD WOMAN I do n't know , Griswold ! I do n't care ! GRISWOLD Because a pig gets killed before he gets cured . OLD WOMAN I would n't have you , man , off a Christmas tree ! Go home ! GRISWOLD Know why life is the hardest riddle ? OLD WOMAN Home ! GRISWOLD Everybody has to give it up . ( Pause ) What is this I hear about you wanting to be took to Tennessee ? Pause . OLD WOMAN Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLD WOMAN Hensley Edwards is a fool . GRISWOLD I know that . But you told him the only man you 'd marry was the man who would sell his farm and take you all the way to Tennessee . How come you want to go to Tennessee ? OLD WOMAN Never you mind . GRISWOLD But you did say it ? OLD WOMAN All right . I said it . It 's my word , and I mean it . GRISWOLD Long trip . Awful hard country . Eighty-odd mile , here to the Tennessee border . Just mountains . How come you want a man to take you there ? OLD WOMAN Griswold , stop going around your elbow to get to your thumb . What business is it of yours ? GRISWOLD This . Come with me . I will take you there . OLD WOMAN What ? GRISWOLD I will sell my land , and take you to Tennessee . OLD WOMAN Griswold , you do n't know what you 're saying . You ai n't got the sense God promised a billy goat . GRISWOLD If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , all right . OLD WOMAN You think I 'm fool enough to go somewhere with a man , and not be married to him ? p. 19 GRISWOLD Then we can get married . OLD WOMAN Oh , Griswold . You are so green , when it rains , you 'll sprout . GRISWOLD I 'm taking you at your word . You 're the one who said the thing . OLD WOMAN And what 's wrong with my word ? It 's just as good as any damn man 's . But that do n't mean you get to put your shoes under my bed . GRISWOLD You want to go to Tennessee . I will take you there . I 'm not asking you why . No questions . Hard country . Dangerous and powerful lonely . No dances , no parties . And I give up my bottom land . But if that is what you want , we 'll go . Think it over . Exit Griswold . The Old Woman speaks to the family . OLD WOMAN Oh , hell . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep off that fool Hensley Edwards . Cross all them mountains ? Great God Almighty . But I did say it . My word . Well , I 'm safe enough . Not even Griswold Plankman is dumb enough to sell off North Carolina bottom land and go farm a wild Tennessee mountain . ( Pause ) Yes . I know . You want me gone . Have done with this eternal squabbling over men . Well , I wo n't . I wo n't go ! HERSHEL ( Very softly ) But you said you would . You 'd marry the man who 'd take you to Tennessee . p. 20 OLD WOMAN And I will ! No man 's idiot enough to do that , never mind try to marry me . Enter Griswold . He puts some flowers in her hands . He turns her gently but firmly so she stands beside him , facing out . Pause.Well , go ahead and say it . HERSHEL I now pronounce you man and wife . OLD WOMAN God damn . GRISWOLD I 'll put your boxes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , making a sort of wagon seat . OLD WOMAN Well , Poppa . Billy , Ab . Rachel . Momma . There 's more to say . I do n't know about Tennessee . HERSHEL You will get there all right . OLD WOMAN Yes , I know . But it seems like there was something else I had to say . Listen  --  GRISWOLD Honey , it 's time . He takes her to the wagon seat , sits her there . He sits beside her , flicks imaginary reins . OLD WOMAN Poppa ! She resigns herself . They travel . Pause . They travel.Ca n't you drive this thing no faster than this ? GRISWOLD In a hurry , are you ? p. 21 OLD WOMAN I 'd like to get to Tennessee before I die . Who sold you this wagon ? Did you look at it at all before you bought it ? Do n't expect me to fix it when it breaks down . When are we going to stop , and spend the night ? GRISWOLD Anytime . OLD WOMAN What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to spend our wedding night ? GRISWOLD Right here . OLD WOMAN You mean in the wagon ? GRISWOLD I do n't mean no boarding house . OLD WOMAN Oh , God . I 've married a miser . Go through the thicket , then pick a crooked stick . He 's so tight , when he walks , he 'll squeak . GRISWOLD I do n't want to be shut up in a tiny little room , with neighbors , and a good-looking bride like you . I figure we 'll want to make some noise about it . OLD WOMAN Oh , you do , do you ? You God damn man ! You coarse , dumb , stupid , God damn man ! You would n't give a lady air in a jug ! I 'm going home ! They should have buried you , Griswold , and raised the afterbirth ! She starts to get out of the wagon . He grabs her , and holds her . GRISWOLD And you are as hot as a hen in a wool blanket . p. 22 OLD WOMAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a considerable scuffle.Man ! Man ! God damn man ! He holds her until she is tired , and a little frightened.All right . You can let go of me now . GRISWOLD Honey , I ai n't never letting you go . How about that ? OLD WOMAN It is what 's happened to me . I confess it , Lord save me . Let go , I wo n't hit you again . GRISWOLD You can if you want to . I think I like it . OLD WOMAN Stop ! Wait ! Stop the wagon ! GRISWOLD Now what ? You aim to run off again ? OLD WOMAN No , you fool . We knocked over a box . It fell off in the road . Stop the wagon , and I 'll go get it . GRISWOLD All right . Do n't run off . OLD WOMAN Just shut up about that , and will you stop the wagon ? He stops/the wagon . The Old Woman gets down and stoops over an imaginary box , fallen from the wagon , and broken open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My box of dressing things . Oh , Lord , look here . My mirror 's busted .

Busted . Oh , me . Griswold puts the imaginary box back onto the wagon . p. 23 GRISWOLD Come on , honey . You ai n't going to need many mirrors in Tennessee . OLD WOMAN Oh , me . GRISWOLD All right , I 'll get you another one , somewhere . Now , come on . OLD WOMAN Just wait a minute ! My hair 's messed up . GRISWOLD It would n't be noticed on a galloping horse . OLD WOMAN Just wait one damn minute ! GRISWOLD All right ! A minute ! The Old Woman holds the mirror , looking about for a place to prop it , so she can look into it with her hands free.Stick it in the burl of that tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sticks it into a burl on the tree stump in the yard , or into one of the logs Hershel brought on and set down . The Old Woman kneels before it , touching up her hair . Griswold gets back into the wagon . The Old Woman does too , looking back at the mirror in the wood.Look at it shine in the sun . Like a star in the daytime . Well , goodbye . Let 's go , Griswold . They travel . Time passes . They travel . Griswold is placid . The Old Woman gets more and more oppressed . She looks about , frightened . She holds it in . She ca n't stand it . She lets it out.Yiiiiiiiii ! p. 24 GRISWOLD What 's the matter ? OLD WOMAN Mountains . Nothing but mountains . My Lord . Nobody nowhere . No cleared land . Nothing . Just mountains . GRISWOLD And more to come . It 's eighty miles to the Tennessee border , up and down . You should have thought about that . OLD WOMAN If I had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible . OLD WOMAN Oh , me . GRISWOLD ( Pointing ) Sourwood . That gold is birch poplar . OLD WOMAN Do n't nobody live in these mountains at all ? GRISWOLD Not many now . Maybe some later , but not so many . It 's wild up here . Steep . Worse in Tennessee . Not much water on the slopes . You got to look hard for decent land . But come fall , when the slopes turn , Tennessee is beautiful . Like a big fire a-burning , all your own . Red and orange and silver leaves , too , and gold and green , and God knows what all . OLD WOMAN Oh , shut up , Griswold . You ai n't never been to Tennessee , no more than I have . What do you know about it ? GRISWOLD Let 's say I understand the nature of Tennessee . I 've heard people talk about it . I 've thought about it . A lot . p. 25 OLD WOMAN You 're crazy . GRISWOLD Maybe . They travel .

Mountains . Yes , it 's a hell of a trip we 're taking , you and me . A long ways from your momma and daddy 's house . Wilderness . But not so long now . Pretty soon . OLD WOMAN Better be pretty soon . ( Pause ) You know why ? GRISWOLD Why ? OLD WOMAN Guess . GRISWOLD Just tell me . OLD WOMAN You best get me there sometime inside the next eight months . I just say that . GRISWOLD Well , hoo-pee ! Then I sure will . We ai n't wasted the time , have we ? OLD WOMAN Part way to Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 GRISWOLD ( Happy ) Yeah . He whistles . They travel , they travel . Then , looking about , Griswold stops the wagon . OLD WOMAN Well , what now ? GRISWOLD We 're in Tennessee . Look . OLD WOMAN But it 's just the same . Mountains and mountains and nobody here but us . GRISWOLD All three of us . OLD WOMAN Oh , me . GRISWOLD But it 's open land . I can clear about over there . Hush , hear the water ? OLD WOMAN ( Listening ) It 's over there . GRISWOLD No , over there . But it 's water . Might near a creek . OLD WOMAN Well , build next to it . GRISWOLD And get flooded out in the spring ? No , you 'll have to walk for it . But here we are , honey . You get the pot . I 'll get the wood . We 'll go down to that creek tonight , and gig us some frogs , for breakfast . OLD WOMAN Oh , me . GRISWOLD It 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hop , honey ! Exit Griswold , whistling . p. 27 OLD WOMAN I hopped , all right . Hopped while you built the house . Hopped while you sat aching and sweating , waiting for your supper . Then you hopped while I had Sally , and we lost Malcolm , and again when Sarah came . And we lived there , alone . At least I did . There was a store , finally , eight mile off . I did n't get to go much . When I did , I knowed Griswold did n't want me saying nothing . We lived , like a man and a woman can , sometimes speaking , sometimes not . Oh , I took the skin off him now and then . ( Smiles ) He come home once saying there was this girl Polly something working at the store , and it was unfortunate , the girl was pregnant . ( Pause ) And they were trying to blame it on us .

Tennessee . Them neighbors we had , oh , they all loved the place . Never stopped saying how lucky we were to be there . Griswold smiling , saying , well it 's where she wanted to go . Everybody nodding , good , good . I wondered why they always did that , but they just always did . Days went by . ( She looks about , fearfully . She stoops . She ages ) Griswold . Enter Griswold , aged now too . He stands partly in shadow . p. 28 GRISWOLD What 's on your mind ? OLD WOMAN It 's hard without the girls . I miss my children .

I could n't see quite through the bresh , but I knew they were there , Mama , Poppa , Rachel , Billy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'd try to hear but could n't , no more than their whisperings , and I 'd find myself standing in places of powerful remembrance , places I 'd stood before . Two days of that walking , when I heard this . ( She rings her cowbell ) I 'd follow Poppa to the barn , a little girl as pleasant as the flowers are made . Hearing this . I heard it again , and went for it again , and what do you think I found ? p. 31 HERSHEL Lady , I sure do n't know . OLD WOMAN Guess . CARDELL A cow ? OLD WOMAN One for you , sonny ! Big Jersey .

Poppa 's cowbell , on some cow two days ' walk , not hardly seven miles , from my yard in Tennessee ? What about this , I thought . What about this ? Am I dead , or what ? Is this heaven ? What 's going on ? ( She moves about the yard , ringing the bell ) Then , on the road , I seen the bend again , and came round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost buried in the tree , but not quite . Enough left sticking out of the burl so 's it could flash at me . Just one little wink in the sun , but I seen it . ( She goes to her mirror again , where Griswold stuck it . She pulls it loose ) I pulled open the growth of the burl , and there hidden was my star in the daytime . I pulled it loose , my mirror , where I 'd left it on the way to Tennessee . ( She looks at herself in the mirror ) There I was . Old woman . Two flashes of a mirror . Little girl , old woman . Good God Almighty , I thought , when I took my bridal mirror out of the tree where he put it , broken , on my wedding day . p. 32 HERSHEL Whew . MARY Hershel , she 's crazy , none of this makes sense . OLD WOMAN It makes sense , all right . I can see it ! Why , that man . That damn man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightheaded and dizzy . One day in Tennessee , the next day Poppa 's cowbell , and my mirror ? Then I come out of the brush , into the clearing , and I seen the house . A boy on the porch . And you . You nice people . ( Pause ) And I am still not sure , not even now while I 'm a-talking to you . Are you the strangers give me spoonbread and tea ? Or are you Poppa ? Are you Rachel , Billy , and Ab ? Is my mother back in the house , making me my wedding dress ? HERSHEL ( Gently ) I am afeared we 're the strangers give you spoonbread . OLD WOMAN Ah , I know it ! Oh , that man ! Griswold , you damn man ! What did you do to me ? HERSHEL Listen , you best come inside and lie down now . You must be awful tired . OLD WOMAN Oh , my God ! Do n't you understand ? What 's wrong with you ? Do n't you see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Great God A-mighty ! The family stands watching her , alarmed . The Old Woman shakes her head , swings her arms . Wheezing , coughing , hopping up and down , ringing her cowbell and flashing her mirror , she stamps out a sort of dance in front of them.That man ! That bloody scoundrel ! He never took me to Tennessee at all ! He put me in a wagon , and he drove me around these mountains over a month ! These same mountains ! Around , in circles ! Then he settled where he 'd meant to all along , in a valley seven miles off ! And I thought I was in Tennessee ! Oh ! My God ! All them people , my neighbors , they was in on it ! Oh ! My children , my own children , they was in on it ! And  --  oh , no . To get me gone , was it ? Poppa ? Momma ? You , too ? Oh , Griswold ! You never told me . You never would have told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a joke was that ? Griswold ! My whole life ! You damn man ! She rages . Her passion pours out of her . She hacks and coughs and stamps her feet . Slowly , her convulsion subsides . She gets her breath.Whew . Shoo . Well , that 's that . Think you lived your life in Tennessee . Find out you did n't . You , up there . Nice people , with your fine estate . House , land , yard and porch . It 's all yours  --  for a while . Good luck . ( She looks at the cowbell and the mirror ) Poppa . Griswold . ( She drops them both ) Bye . ( To the family ) So long . p. 33 MARY Wait ! Do n't go now . It 's dark . OLD WOMAN I know it . MARY Hershel ! Stop her . HERSHEL Wait , now . Where you going ? OLD WOMAN Back to Tennessee . Where else ? That man . That damn man . ( She is gone ) MARY Hershel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . They shiver . Hershel looks out at his land , then back to the house. I 'm hungry . Let 's go eat now . Give me the baby . He takes the baby from Cardell , holds it tightly , then pushes his wife ahead of him , in to supper . Cardell stares off after the Old Woman . He picks up her mirror , and sees his face in it .
