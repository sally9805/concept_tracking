Sometimes so many positives happen in one baseball game that isolating any unfairly diminishes the rest . The Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 8-3 Sunday afternoon before 32 , 016 in sunny and continued hot Wrigley Field . Here are the positives , in no particular order of positivity : - Mike Bielecki ( 2-0 ) , pressed into service a second time as a fill-in starter , had his second solid outing . He threw seven good innings to gain his first victory since back on Opening Night. - Les Lancaster , 24 hours after coming off the 21-day disabled list where he recovered from his appendectomy , retired all six batters he faced , striking out the sixth. - Darrin Jackson gave the Cubs their first pinch home run of the season . It was Jackson ' s first homer since June 3. - Mitch Webster had two hits , including his second homer in a week , plus a walk . He is five for his last eight at-bats with four runs and three runs batted in. - Damon Berryhill threw out the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleman and Jose Oquendo . He also had two doubles and a walk in four at-bats. - Mark Grace , after Ryne Sandberg was walked to fill the bases in front of him , ripped a two-run single to give the Cubs a three-run lead in the seventh. - Andre Dawson , not even supposed to play , gave Grace a chance to get that bases-loaded hit with some terrific baserunning . Now , that ' s a lot of paragraphs preceded by those cute little black splotches , but it was that kind of game . " We ' re going to go into Cincinnati with a little momentum , " Grace said . It ' s momentum built on taking two of three from the always annoying Cardinals after taking two of three from the first-place Mets . This one was in serious doubt early . Gary Varsho , who started the game in place of Dawson , put the Cubs ahead in the second with an RBI single , but St. Louis countered with two in the fourth . Tony Pena drove in one of the runs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced a hit off the plate and into center field . Vance Law ' s single and Berryhill ' s second straight double tied it in the fourth at 2 , but Tom Brunansky regained the lead for the Cards in the fifth with his 17th home run , his 11th on the road . Bielecki heard about that homer from Berryhill after his final pitch in the seventh . " He came up to me and he said , ' Good job , ' " Bielecki said . " And I said : ' Yeah , and you called a really good game . I only shook you off once . ' And I said , ' You know which one that was , don ' t you ? ' " And he said , ' Yeah , I know which one , and it ' s still going . ' " In the sixth , with a man on , Jackson hit for Varsho and faced Ken Dayley . " Jody ( Davis ) said he ' ll throw a fastball , " Jackson said . " That ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I got lucky and hit it . " When it came down , the Cubs led 4-3 . Dawson hit for Bielecki leading off the seventh and coaxed a walk from Dayley ( 2-6 ) . When Webster grounded a single toward Coleman in left , Dawson , who had practically stopped rounding second , saw something he liked . " I saw him drop his head , " Dawson said . " He seemed to stay back on it , and that ' s when I just tried to get it in gear . " Coleman , startled , rushed his throw to third and threw it past Terry Pendleton , allowing Webster to trot into second . " Hell of a play , " manager Don Zimmer said . " That set the tone for the whole inning . " St. Louis skipper Whitey Herzog put Sandberg on , figuring left-hander Dayley had a better shot against left-hander Grace . It didn ' t work out that way . Grace ' s solid single to center made it 6-3 . Webster ' s two-run homer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the basket in center-a Wrigley Field wind-blown classic-capped it . " I couldn ' t believe that one , " Webster said . " I just watched Ford . He just kept drifting like he didn ' t believe it was going out , either . " " I ' ve never seen anything like it , " Ford said . " I nearly killed myself on a home run . " " This park is a joke , " Herzog said . " Beautiful Wrigley Field . . . " Beautiful day for Lancaster . " It was weird , " Lancaster said . " I haven ' t got the full strength back yet , but that ' ll come . I was really pleased , and I think they were , too . " They were . " To me , " Zimmer said , " he looked like a pitcher . I saw him today throw more low strikes than before the operation . " Maybe this guy is realizing there ' s more to it than just getting the ball and seeing how hard you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about it . " We need an off-day , believe me , " Zimmer said , looking forward to Monday , the club ' s first real day off since the All-Star break , which wasn ' t a break for everybody . " This off-day comes at the right time for us , because we ' ve got a lot of nagging injuries , " Zimmer said Could list those , but we ' re out of those little black splotches .
