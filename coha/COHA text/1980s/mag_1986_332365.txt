At the dawning there were isolated stragglers , determinedly circling suburban high school tracks or pacing through city parks . Most Americans did not suppose these were the harbingers of a U.S. craze . But by the end of the 1970s joggers were everywhere , all seemingly in training for the marathon . Other citizens , plunging into alternate activities , were equally fervid . Swimmers boasted of laps completed , cyclists of long-distance touring , and weight lifters of pounds pressed . Today Americans live in a land where fit is proper . Strut your sweat . The majority , who remain woefully unfit , are now the ones who feel out of step ; shamefacedly , they even outfit the body as if they exercised it . Togged out in sneaks and sweats , they proclaim their affiliation , in spirit if not in the flesh , with the fitness generation . The prototype runners below offer a look at the characteristics and habits of that new U.S. animal , Homo exercens americanus .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
