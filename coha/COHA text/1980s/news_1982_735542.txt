txt Allied Corp . plans to follow its acquisition of Bendix Corp . with a major debt reduction campaign involving the sale of portfolio investments and reductions in the level of working capital . The sale of investments could include all or part of Bendix 's 7.2% stake in RCA Corp. , valued at about $127 million at current market prices . Although a top Allied official said the company does n't have any immediate plans to sell the stock , he added that the company will consider it . In the Allied-Bendix proxy statement being mailed to shareholders , Allied said it intends to reduce its long-term debt by $300 million within three to six months after the acquisition and by an additional $700 million " in the longer term . " Total combined debt of Allied and Bendix previously was estimated at about $2.6 billion .

In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , RCA 's common closed at $23 a share , clown 62.5 cents , and its $2.125 cumulative preferred closed at $21.75 a share , down 25 cents . Bendix 's RCA holding was acquired last March amid speculation that Bendix intended to take over RCA . Sources said at the time that Bendix 's chairman , William M. Agee , expressed an interest in merging Bendix with RCA but was rebuffed by RCA 's chairman Thornton Bradshaw . When Bendix first announced its acquisition of RCA stock , RCA issued a , statement saying the purchase was " not welcome " and began a personal attack on Mr. Agee . Harold W. Buirkle , Allied senior vice president , said the RCA stake will be " looked at very hard " when Allied examines Bendix 's assets . " We 're not going out and selling the RCA stock tomorrow , " he said , adding that Allied is " trying to avoid fire sales . " An RCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be interested in acquiring the Bendix stake itself . Allied 's plan , based on the proxy material , is to reduce its debt-to-capital ratio from the 38% it is expected to be when the Bendix acquisition is completed to 33% to 34% within three to six months after the acquisition . Mr. Buirkle said the $300 million is a " reasonably easy target for us . " As of Sept. 30 , Bendix 's balance sheet showed $148.1 million of cash and marketable securities while Allied 's balance sheet put cash , short-term securites and time deposits at $78 million . Allied has also arranged to reduce working capital requirements by transferring on a revolving basis over the next five years as much as $150 million of receivables to an investor at discounts , the proxy material said . The investor was n't identified . As for the " longer term " $700 million debt reduction , " that 's going to be tough , " Mr. Buirkle said . The $700 million would bring Allied 's debt-to-capital ratio down to about 25% , slightly higher than the 22% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to accomplish the reduction by the end of 1984 . Among the alternatives the proxy statement mentions are selling real estate and other nonmanufacturing assets , divesting itself of certain businesses and seeking joint venture partners for Allied 's depressed soda ash and fertilizer products businesses . Allied cited as possible divestitures its Woodstock Die Casting division , its Marshalltown Instruments division , which makes pressure and temperature gauges , and its Automotive Products division , which makes seat belts . The proxy cautions that if Allied ca n't reduce its debt by at least $300 million , Allied will have to develop alternative strategies to reduce its debt-to-capital ratio that could involve selling Allied securities or Allied or Bendix assets " not otherwise considered likely candidates for sale . " If it ca n't reduce the ratio , Allied said the consequences " most likely " would include a downgrading of Allied 's publicly held debt securities and preferred stock . Moody 's Investors Service Inc. has already lowered its ratings on Allied senior debt , commercial paper and lease-back tax-exempt securities to reflect the greater debt associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in connection with special shareholder meetings Jan. 31 , also said that the " golden parachute " employment contracts for top Bendix executives remain in effect .
