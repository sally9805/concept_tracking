Britain 's Lady Diana , at 19 , the fairest of them all <P> Past the classic first editions bound in leather , pages leafed in gold . Past the photographs , all framed in hand-worked silver . Past the old oak tables crowded with souvenirs of distant , long-lived lives , toward a deep chair washed in the dim gold light of a British late autumn . <P> The man there looks up . He is of indeterminate age but clearly senior bearing . He smiles slightly , then turns down the volume of an old radio that is playing a familiar fragment from Mouret 's Symphony and Fanfare for the King 's Supper . He crosses his legs , letting the toe of his bench-made oxford dangle a little above the floor and occasionally-at moments of infrequent agitation-allowing it to graze the surface of the carpet underfoot . <P> He arranges his book in his lap , keeping his place casually with a finger , as if he does not expect to be interrupted for long . He settles back . He speaks . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to the 50th anniversary of Masterpiece Theater , and the third chapter of our series Monarchy in Love . We have already seen the dedicated and rambunctious Prince of Wales-who had not yet become Charles III-in the sunset years of his bachelorhood , struggling to maintain his independence while hewing to a royal role that sometimes interfered with the imperatives of young manhood . <P> " Now young Wales , as he was known to intimates , was fully aware of the importance of his position , and worked tirelessly at the endless ceremonial duties the Prince must perform . One of these duties did not come so naturally to him as the others , however . That was marriage . He applied himself to that particular inevitability with not quite as much stamina but fully as much ingenuity as he devoted to mastering the steeplechase . <P> " It will be recalled from our first episode , Where 's Charlie ? , that the Prince took several nasty spills on the course about this time , and many of his subjects , who were aware that two previous Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charles ' attempts to find a suitable bride-or the attempts by the press to find one for him-resulted in many false starts , much bruised feeling and the occasional contretemps that seems , in retrospect , almost comic . At the time though , his quest was no laughing matter . Anthony Holden , one of his biographers , recalls that Charles became ' obsessed with the subject of marriage ' and often noted , with a touch of sadness , that most of his friends were wed . We saw the feelings of his parents , the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh , turn from indulgence to impatience until , one long weekend when the Prince was away and unreachable , the Queen gave vent to the slightly petulant and now famous question that lent the episode its title .
