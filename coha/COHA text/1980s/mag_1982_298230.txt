Did Jackson push too hard ? <P> When the Rev. Jesse Jackson , the founder of Operation PUSH ( People United to Save Humanity ) visited St. Louis early this month , he pointedly congratulated 7-Up for its commitment to black-run enterprises over the next five years . Then he met with a group of black businessmen and made a rather blunt proposition : to finance a drive designed to encourage the Anheuser-Busch brewery to give more contracts to minority firms , they should each donate $500 to Operation PUSH . Said Jackson : " We 're all family here , but you have to pay to play . " <P> To that , a number of black St. Louis businessmen took offense . " We do n't need any outsider coming in and telling us how to get along and telling us we have to pay him to make progress , " said one . Other blacks complained that Jackson had targeted the wrong company : 18% of Anheuser-Busch employees are minorities and the company purchases $40 million annually from black businesses . Said William Douthit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have always pointed to Anheuser-Busch as an example of ideal corporate social responsibility . " <P> Jackson , 40 , was not without his defenders . At a press conference of 50 black businessmen and ministers , Dr. James Declue , president of the local N.A.A.C.P. board , said , " We support the Rev. Mr. Jackson 's concept . It would be idiotic not to , because we are doing the same thing . " But he stopped short of endorsing a campaign against Anheuser-Busch . For his part , Jackson accused his critics of ignoring their obligation to organizations like PUSH that have helped blacks . Said he : " Anybody who wants to pick apples off the ground but is not interested in the forces pushing the tree is looking for something for nothing . ' '
