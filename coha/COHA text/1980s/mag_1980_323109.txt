Novel defense for Viet vets <P> Michael Tindall got two Distinguished Flying Crosses , two bronze stars and 32 air medals during his year as an Army helicopter pilot in Viet Nam . Now he faces a September trial in Boston , where his attorney , Joseph Oteri , will use footage from The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now to try to convince a federal jury that even if Tindall did smuggle drugs into the U.S. nearly six years ago , as the Government contends , he should not be held responsible . The reason : the war turned his client into an " action junkie " unable to resist opportunities to enjoy thrills . <P> Such a defense is not as desperate as it might seem . Both the Veterans Administration and the American Psychiatric Association have officially recognized what is called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , and lawyers have used it to seek acquittals or reduced sentences in nearly two dozen cases involving Viet Nam veterans . With experts estimating that as many as 700,000 people who saw combat in the war may suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PTSD may become a common , and successful , defense for crimes . <P> The symptoms of PTSD include mental flashbacks rooted in combat experiences , guilt pangs and feelings of helplessness . While not all authorities believe PTSD is very different from the shell shock or combat fatigue suffered by soldiers in earlier wars , those who do cite the uniqueness of Viet Nam . Says Jeffrey Steinberg , a Santa Rosa , Calif. , lawyer who parlayed a PTSD defense into an acquittal for a client accused of assault : " The vets were viewed by the public as baby killers , as a bunch of losers . They found difficulty in justifying themselves . " <P> An ex-G.I. ' s PTSD may not show up for years . When it does , notes Psychologist John Wilson , there is usually some precipitating stress , like divorce or loss of job . Occasionally , says Wilson , who has aided the defense in 16 PTSD cases , the veteran responds with combat instincts , sometimes to the extent of donning fatigues and grabbing a rifle . <P> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine Charles Pettibone . He went to the Santa Rosa office of Congressman Don H. Clausen and was distressed to find him out . He held a knife at a security guard 's neck for two hours until FBI officers got him to surrender . Attorney Steinberg got Pettibone acquitted on the argument that a sense of helplessness had catapulted him back to his Viet Nam days , rendering him effectively " unconscious . " <P> In Rockville , Md. , in 1979 Stephen Gregory got probation instead of a jail term thanks to a PTSD defense . Brandishing two rifles , he had held patrons in a Maryland bank hostage for 6 hours after yelling , " This is not a stickup . " His lawyer argued that Gregory was reliving a wartime event in which his best friend was killed ; the policemen outside the bank became the Viet Cong in Gregory 's mind , while the hostages were the comrades he sought to lead to safety .
