The general , who was field commander of the small force that sparked the nation to oust Ferdinand E. Marcos , sent a message to the troops announcing that he was demoting some of the strongest Marcos supporters among command officers. // Among the first to ascend in the post-Marcos command are some of the field officers who defected with their troops to his side early , when the risk of a pro-Marcos attack seemed greatest. // Signaling the change was the choice of Brig . Gen. Ramon J. Farolan as chief of the air force . This reflected the fact that among the first to change sides were air force pilots who landed by helicopter gunships at the camp of General Ramos and Juan Ponce Enrile , the Marcos official who began the resistance Saturday and has become the new Government ' s Minister of Defense , his former post. // // Is a Cousin of Marcos // General Farolan is a cousin of Mr. Marcos with a reputation for integrity , according to knowledgable officials in the Aquino administration . He replaced Maj. Gen. Vicente M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Ver , the former chief of armed forces who fled into exile with Mr. Marcos. // General Farolan provided something of a rallying point for reformist officers when General Ver was indicted after the assassination of Benigno S. Aquino Jr. in 1983 . Later acquitted , General Ver was defended in a letter signed by the high command , but General Farolin did not sign it and publicly objected when his name was neverthless affixed. // Other major appointments were Comdr . Serapio C. Martillano as chief of the Navy , replacing Rear Adm . Brillante C. Ochoco , who was promoted to the job after being among the first to defend General Ver in the assassination controversy. // The basic complaint from Pentagon experts is that the efficiency of the 200 , 000 members of the Philippine military badly eroded under Mr. Marcos because of political corruption and favoritism. // The major result , the analysts say , is a weakening of the ability to combat the Communist insurgency , which had grown in recent years under the Marcos Government ' s preoccupation with muting political opposition. // Officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Mr. Marcos , again under American pressure , ordered such plans , which he never enacted . <> <> ' Overstaying ' Generals at Target // President Corazon C. Aquino promised in her campaign against Mr. Marcos that she would force the retirement of " overstaying " generals , about 30 retirement-age officers whose careers were extended by Mr. Marcos as a way of rooting their loyalty in the presidential palace. // General Ramos , himself one of the extended generals , made no immediate announcement about this , but he is known to feel that the practice corrupts professionalism and retards the careers of younger , more professional officers who have quietly rallied around him in recent years. // In making the appointments , General Ramos ordered the " highest standards of conduct and discipline " from the military .

This was considered a public relations ploy in response to Administration pressures to remove General Ver and begin improving the military . <> <> Ramos Has Been Bypassed // In fact , General Ramos lost power in recent years as General Ver altered the lines of authority to bypass the Philippine Constabulary , commanded by General Ramos , so that he lost field command primacy to the presidential palace. // With Filipino military morale , equipment , leadership and training considered in bad repair , American military experts are likely to remain skeptical for a while , at least , about the chances of improving the armed forces .

The Aquino assassination marked the nadir of the military , as 25 members , plus one civilian , were indicted in an purported military conspiracy but then released in an acquittal widely doubted by the public . <> <> ' Image Has Been Refurbished ' // " The image of the armed forces has been refurbished in the last 24 hours , " Gen.
