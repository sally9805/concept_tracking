In most of the U.S. , they would be something of a rarity these days-three generations under one roof . They share a modest , four-bedroom house in Westchester , a mostly Cuban town in the western part of Dade County : Carlos Marquez Sterling , 83 , and his wife Waldina Hernndez Cata , 66 ; Daughter Uva , 37 , and her husband Jorge J. Clavijo , 45 ; and their two children , Uvi , 17 , and Christina , 12 . As has been true of other Cuban families with several generations living in South Florida , some members of the Marquez Sterling dynasty have found adjusting to the American way of life difficult . Admits Uva : " We have encountered all the problems of adaptation . " <P> Don Carlos , the patriarch of the family , grew up in Cuba and , as a professor of history at the University of Havana , helped write his country 's 1940 constitution . Nearly two decades later he found himself opposing both the corrupt regime of President Fulgencio Batista and the revolution headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Castro gained power on New Year 's Day 1959 , Don Carlos , his wife and stepdaughter fled the country and settled in Washington . Uva 's boyfriend Jorge left Cuba to join Uva in 1961 . That same year , the family moved to New York City , where Don Carlos eventually took a job teaching Spanish at Long Island 's C.W. Post College . Jorge and Uva married in 1962 . The entire family moved to South Florida in 1978 . <P> The move , Uva believes , was " a great decision . " She is a writer and poet at home in the Latin atmosphere of Miami . " Even though I 've been in the U.S. for 21 years and know English well enough , I feel in Spanish , " says Uva , who has published four books of poetry in her native language . She will begin graduate studies in Spanish literature at the University of Miami this January , while Jorge , a real estate agent , is studying for his B.

The grandparents prefer to speak Spanish at home and tune in only Spanish-language TV and radio programs , Don Carlos , center , and his family while Uva and Jorge switch back and forth between Spanish and English programs , and Uvi and Christina strictly prefer American offerings . The grandmother feels that her grandchildren 's American friends are " very ill-mannered and have excessive freedom , " and Uva must often act as referee between her mother and her daughters . Twenty years ago , for example , the grandparents insisted that a chaperone accompany Uva and Jorge when they went out , but now Uvi is permitted to go on dates without one . Even Uva and Jorge are sometimes divided over U.S. manners and mores . " Cuban men find it difficult to adjust their machismo to allow their women to work , " says Uva . " This has been tough on Jorge , but he has adjusted . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
