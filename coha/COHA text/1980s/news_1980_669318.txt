From New york to Norfolk , from New Orleans to Galveston , and from Los Angeles to Seattle , seaports are buzzing with increased activity as the nation imports Japanese autos , West German steel , and foreign oil and exports grain , coal , and machinery . Some 90 percent of all imports and exports move through the seaports. // President Carter , in his State of the Union message this year , noted that 1 of every 7 US jobs in manufacturing now depends " upon our export performance , " and that the country ' s exports of grains and manufactured items grew " by an unparalleled $35 billion last year , reaching a level of over $180 billion. " // Further underscoring the importance of the nation ' s ports is a variety of recent Department of Commerce statistics : The port industry in 1977 ( the latest year for which complete national figures are available ) contributed about $30 billion to the nation ' s gross national product , added about $20 billion in personal income , and brought in federal taxes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The industry employed more than 1 million people and handled a total of nearly 2 billion tons of cargo last year . The total growth rate in foreign and domestic tonnage handled over the past four years has been about 3. 7 percent per year . Over the next 20 years , the Commerce Department estimates , the volume of US export-import bulk tonnage will more than double , to more than 600 million tons annually , or approaching 2 million tons per day. // Probably the greatest development for the seaports was the advent of containerization . This allowed companies to ship small items , such as electronic goods , in truck trailers that could be prepacked . It helped cut pilferage , loading and unloading time , and  --  as a consequence  --  the cost of shipping. // It also resulted in ports spending large amounts of money on new containerization facilities , making the port industry capital-intensive instead of labor-intensive . In the Port of New York alone , notes Clifford B. O ' Hara , director of port commerce , containerization ' s share of port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 80 percent today. // This surge has honed the ports ' natural competitive nature . For Example , Baltimore , watching New York capture a greater share of the container market because of major capital expenditures 10 years ago , has embarked on an ambitious expansion program to try to catch up. // New Orleans , the nation ' s second-largest port , has also been spending heavily to upgrade its facilities after it fell behind other ports in containerization . Many other Southern ports are in the process of upgrading their facilities. // In the view of one Commerce Department official , the Southeastern and Southwestern ports will show the greatest growth , both because of rapid population growth in those areas and because of their large spending on containerization . Lower labor costs in these ports will be a significant factor in their growth , despite the fact that seaports have become capital intensive rather than labor intensive. // A key factor behind this change is the importance of efficient cargo handling on the docks to ensure that cost-conscious shippers can get their vessels to spend more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surge in shipping has also stimulated massive new investment in port facilities . According to a Department of Commerce survey , investment between 1973 and 1978 came to $1. 68 billion , compared with $3. 8 billion in the much longer period from 1946 to 1973 . And expenditures through 1983 are expected to total about $3. 371 billion. // Accompanying this growth , the ports have been facing a raft of problems . These include : // Labor issues . Despite major federal efforts at times to " clean up " the waterfront , organized crime has maintained a sizable influence on the unions that make up the bulk of the labor force on the docks . Anthony J. Tozzoli , director of marine terminals for the Port Authority of New York , says it is too early to tell if the " character " of the International Longshoreman ' s Union in New York has improved since the conviction last year of Anthony Scotto , its leader , on labor racketeering charges. // Another important labor problem , insurance executives point out , is the large number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly those in New York . To insure stevedores in the Port of New York costs $86 per $100 to payroll , compared with $32 per $100 of payroll on the Gulf coast. // According to John Buzbee , a director of Marsh &; McLennan , the nation ' s largest insurance broker , it is nearly impossible to find an insurance company that wants to take the business , regardless of the premium . The result , he says , is that a lot of companies will not be able to stay in business in New York. // Dredging . There are uncertainties surrounding some 15 large dredging projects because of environmental concerns over where the " spoil , " or dredged material  --  some of which the Environmental Protection Agency says might be potentially hazardous  --  will be dumped. // US Rep. John M. Murphy ( D ) of New York , chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee , recently stated during a hearing that it is " critical " that this issue be resolved soon or many of the nation ' s ports will face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year when maintenance dredging in New York Harbor had been postponed because of the presence of PCBs , a chemical believed to be carcinogenic , in the bottom of the harbor . As a result , the Queen Elizabeth II was unable to make its normal call in New York Harbor . Only an emergency dredging permitted the luxury cruise liner to tie up at the city ' s passenger terminal . Still unresolved is the question of what to do with the spoil. // In hearings in Washington in March and May , scientific opinion seemed divided over the advisability of continued dredging of the harbor. // An EPA official , Dr. Frank Wilkes , stated that if the PCBs were dumped in the ocean after dredging it could represent " a potential health hazard. " // However , other scientists said that the chemicals did not appear to enter the aquatic food chain and that dumping them would not constitute a danger if they were capped with a covering of sand. // Cost sharing . One of the most controversial issues for the seaports is the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation ' s water policy , decided to include seaports in the category of projects that must put up locally 5 percent of the cost of any new projects. // Since big dredging projects are expensive  --  often running $100 million to $200 million  --  the new cost rules are being challenged by the ports . Herbert Haar Jr. , chairman of the American Association of Port Authorities ' ad hoc committee on dredging , contends that the ports already foot 15 to 20 percent of the cost of large dredging projects , since they must supply right-of-way access to the ports , as well as a place to dump the spoil. // With some 10 dredging projects under consideration around the country , Mr. Haar estimates that local ports or communities would have to come up with about $75 million as their share of the costs. // He argues that when ports are developed it serves the national interest . In New Orleans , for example , where Mr. Haar is associate port director , he says 80 percent of all the traffic is national in nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports would stand to benefit over small ports , since smaller ones would be unable to afford the 5 percent local funding , which must be contributed before the project ' s start-up. // It is the belief of the Carter administration that the benefits of navigational projects chiefly accrue to the local areas where they are done . It is known that government officials , particularly in the Office of Management &; Budget , believe the 5 percent requirement gives a local community a chance to prove that it really needs a project . Otherwise , government officials argue , a community would accept money every time it was offered it. // Federal standards . The ports have also been affected by the proliferation of federal rules and regulartions . The Maritime Administration , an arm of the Commerce Department , made a study in 1978 on the effects of the federal rules and concluded that " the primary effect of these federal standards has been to place additional financial obligations on local public ports that are nonrevenue producing , but are required by law for social or environmental reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet federal standards represented 8 percent of annual capital budgets and 6 percent of available operating funds of local public ports. // The Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee has also asked the General Accounting Office to study the effect of federal rules on the ports , and according to one staff member of the committee , the preliminary report by the GAO indicates that " the federal government is not ' cutting ' it. " // Port activities are considered important business in Washington . In fact , the Port Caucus , made up of various congressmen who have an interest in seaport affairs , is probably one of the largest caucuses in Congress , with 134 members . The seaports also have their full-time lobby in Washington in the American Association of Port Authorities. // Ports have also discovered that Washington is full of programs that can be beneficial to port development . One Washington insider notes that an aggressive port director can apply for Economic Development Agency funds , Urban Development Action Grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development , a planning grant under the Coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works and Transportation Committee , and state participation funds . " A guy who knows the programs can get ecomic stimulus in a big way , " he concludes. // The future is bright for the nation ' s ports , port officials believe , despite their hassles with the federal government . A Massachusetts Institute of Technology study , for example , says world coal production will triple by the year 2000 . The Department of Energy estimates that US coal exports could amount to 100 million tons annually by 1990 , adding an additional $5 billion on to the US balance of payments . Most of this coal would be shipped through the ports. // Grain traffic could also expand , despite the coolness that now exists between the United States and the Soviet Union  --  one of the chief buyers of US grain . The Department of Agriculture is estimating that US grain exports will expand to 460 million tons by the year 2000 , as against about 67. 8 million tons in 1977 . At $160 per ton , this could add another $80 billion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coal and grain as well as compete with other countries , ports say they have to deepen the channels leading to the docks . According to Mr. Haar , a deepening of the Mississippi River channel to let in ships with 50-foot drafts could reduce the costs exporting grain by $3. 50 a ton . " This could make the difference between the US vs . Australia or Argentina getting a big order , " he says . In fact , for each inch of additional draft over 40 feet , he figures , a ship can add another 250 tons of cargo . If one ship cn add an extra 30 , 000 tons of grain , it can carry an extra $7 million in cargo , cutting down on freight expenses. // //
