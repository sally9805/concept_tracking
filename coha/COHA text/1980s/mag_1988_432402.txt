 | Janet Wilson was 31 years old last March , pregnant and absolutely delighted . She and her husband , Glenn , had been married for 10 years but they waited to have a baby until their lives in New York settled down . When Janet was just 11 weeks along , she had a vague sensation that the miraculous changes in her body had somehow stopped occurring . She felt odd twinges in her uterus . She awoke one morning to a few spots of blood . Her doctor told her to take it easy and , for the next three days , Janet alternatively cramped and spotted , reeling between optimism and despair . " I was lying on a couch with my feet up , scared to move , " she recalls . The fourth night brought real pain ? and frequent trips to the bathroom as Janet started to expel clumps of blood . When she and Glenn finally went to the hospital , doctors confirmed their worst fears : Janet had suffered a miscarriage and she needed a dilatation and curettage ( D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her aching , cramping uterus . At first , Janet was preoccupied with the physical trauma she was undergoing . Only later did the magnitude of the loss set in . Friends , family and even physicians could n't seem to fully comprehend her feelings . At a follow-up visit , her obstetrician , a woman , asked how she was . When Janet answered " terrible , " the doctor replied casually : " Oh , have you been working hard lately ? " Four months later , with the tears shed but the heartache lingering on , Janet tried to explain what she had been through : " I had a miscarriage . I experienced it as the death of our child ... and I am terrified of it happening again . . . People minimize our loss when they say things like , You 're young , you can have lots of babies , ' It 's God 's will , ' or It 's for the best ? there was probably something wrong with the baby . ' . The truth is ? as with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix it . . . What helps me is to know that others view my child as real ? for like the Velveteen Rabbit , he was real to me . The reality of conceiving this child , carrying this child and losing this child has changed me forever . " It has been called nature 's " quality con-@#  | trol " ? the spontaneous self-destruction of a baby not perfect enough to be born , or who somehow finds its mother 's womb an inhospitable place for reasons as varied as a minor infection or immune-system problems . But that is small comfort to the millions of women each year who watch their dreams dissolve in an unexpected flow of blood . Immediately after a miscarriage , a woman has all the same raging hormones that make for postpartum depression ? only there is no compensating bundle of love waiting to be cuddled at the end of the hall . It is common to be angry at God , at doctors and at every woman wheeling a baby down the street . It is also common to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most common phenomena in medicine , and one of the most emotionally devastating . But it is also one of the least understood and , until recent years , one of the least investigated . No one knows for sure how often miscarriages occur ; there are no uniform reporting standards . And the venues of sadness vary : some are played out at home , some in doctors ' offices , some in hospitals . In the past , experts assumed that about 10 to 15 percent of recognized pregnancies would fail . They now know that the unrecognized rate is much higher . Using highly sensitive tests that can detect hormone changes as early as seven days after conception , a study reported in The New England Journal of Medicine last month concluded that 31 percent of all " implanting " embryos miscarry , often before the woman realizes she is pregnant . As many as 75 percent of all fertilized eggs never yield a live baby , according to other estimates . The pain , of course , comes from the losses that women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 out of every 4 women knows she has had at least one miscarriage ; roughly 1 in 300 suffers three or more . The risk rises with the mother 's age . That is just one reason researchers suspect that the overall incidence is increasing , as more women postpone having children . But it may simply be that women are talking about miscarriage more , and feeling the loss more acutely , particularly those who waited until their mid-30s to start trying to get pregnant . With frustration building and biological clocks running down , women are demanding answers and rebelling against the standard medical prescription to " Just try again , dear . " " I approached this problem the way I dealt with my career ? I wanted to take charge , " says Perry-Lynn Moffitt of New York . She lost two pregnancies and had to search for a doctor who finally diagnosed a hormone imbalance , enabling her to have two children . " Successful women are used to being in control . " Foreign body : It may be some comfort to chronic miscarriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the problems of early pregnancy is growing rapidly ( following story ) . Sophisticated vaginal ultrasound devices can now detect a fetal heartbeat , or the lack of one , as early as six weeks after a woman 's last period . In vitro fertilization is unlocking secrets of defects in individual sperm and eggs . Researchers are tracking the paths of microscopic bacteria that can sabotage the growing fetus . Immunologists are studying ? even tinkering with ? the delicate bio-@#  | chemical processes that must take place so that the mother does not reject the tiny embryo as a foreign body . Increasingly , researchers view reproduction as a continuum and think that the problems of infertility , miscarriage and premature delivery may all be linked . " Only in the early ' 70s could they measure reproductive hormones . Now we do it almost routinely , if the patient warrants it , " says Dr. Jonathan Scher , a New York obstetrician who treats chronic miscarriers . " There are all kinds of things we can do . " Yet many obstetricians still follow the textbook rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscarriages before attempting to diagnose causes ; many insurance companies wo n't pay for tests or treatments earlier . The rationale is statistical : the vast majority of women who lose one pregnancy will carry the next one successfully . And some 60 percent of those who suffer three miscarriages will go on to have healthy babies , even without treatment . Dr. John Repke of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine puts it bluntly : " Most specialists do n't consider it a problem until three spontaneous abortions have occurred . " No blame : Patients define " a problem " differently ; many women do n't want to wait for three failures . Jeanne Wilson , 37 , of Aptos , Calif. , became her own determined sleuth , searching medical journals to try to understand her first loss , then her second and her third . Now she is undergoing an experimental treatment to correct a possible imbalance in her immune system . But she is frustrated still . " Doctors do n't know about this . Half of them ca n't explain it correctly , " Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for asking questions . " The lack of medical explanation often leads couples to blame themselves . " A lot of women immediately ask , What have I done ? Was it that glass of wine ? Was it my job ? ' , " says Dr. Benjamin Sachs , director of maternal and fetal medicine at Boston 's Beth Israel Hospital . " I try to assure them that it was n't their fault . " Most doctors insist that short of using a lethal weapon on herself , there is almost nothing a woman can do to trigger a miscarriage . About half of fetal losses can be explained by chromosomal , hormonal or anatomical abnormalities . There are dozens of theories that attempt to account for the remainder , but no reliable data . Ironically , the search for answers is complicated by the fact that miscarriages are so common ; it is virtually impossible to conduct controlled studies or to isolate one possible cause from another . To listen to the news , the world seems to be filled with many hazards for pregnant women . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among women who work with VDT 's , farm workers who deal with pesticides , **29;1106;TOOLONG operators and nurse anesthetists . But experts are skeptical . " Clusters are the bane of the epidemiologist 's existence , " says Dr. Allen Wilcox of the National Institute of Health and Environmental Studies , the lead author of last month 's New England Journal of Medicine study . " They create a lot of concern for the people involved . But since a certain number of miscarriages will happen just by chance , it is very difficult . . . to separate the perception of a problem from a real problem . " Nagging question : While scientists continue to probe for cause and effect , psychiatrists are focusing on the intense emotional upheaval that miscarriage can bring . " For a woman , a miscarriage is not just the loss of a wanted baby , it 's a loss of her self-esteem and an assault on her sense as a competent woman , " says Ingrid Kohn , professional coordinator of the Pregnancy Loss Support Program in New York City . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on marriages , just when both husband and wife need support most . A husband tends to be more concerned with his wife 's physical well-being . He may also feel the loss deeply but is n't sure how to show it . " I got the advice that I should be strong for my wife , " says Matthew Fritz of Omaha , whose wife , Paula , has lost five babies between miscarriage and premature birth . " I guess that was true , but it did n't leave me much room to grieve myself . " Comfort may lie in talking with others who have been through the experience . RESOLVE Inc. , a Massachusetts-based support group that deals with problems of infertility and miscarriage , now has 15,000 members in 49 chapters . SHARE , based in Belleville , Ill. , has 200 chapters and a bimonthly newsletter with a circulation of 3,000 . SHARE was founded in 1977 by Sister Jane Marie Lamb , a maternity nurse who found herself searching for words to soothe hospital patients . " One of the biggest problems that parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , " says Lamb . @#  | " Nobody seems to recognize that a baby has died . " To correct that , Lamb encourages couples to give the baby a name , make out an unofficial " certificate of life , " or hold a memorial service . A cemetery in Springfield , Ill. , has one large plot for the remains of miscarried pregnancies . The headstone reads " Holy Innocents . " For many couples , the loss is too abstract for such gestures . That is part of the problem : miscarriers are caught in an emotional gray area between the ongoing frustration of infertility and the pain of losing a beloved child . To mourn the loss is agonizing ; to forget about it seems like betrayal . Each woman must find her own way . Before her third miscarriage New York artist Mimi Smith knitted a " doll-like sculpture " of a baby . After she miscarried , she added a sad , stark inscription to the undershirt : " The baby is dead . " Roller-coaster : The conflicting emotions can destroy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combat zone . And the fear of another disaster can turn subsequent pregnancies into an emotional rollercoaster ride . " I do n't know which is worse ? getting my period so I can be hysterical for a few days , or being pregnant and being scared again , " says one woman who has had 16 miscarriages . " The thought of becoming pregnant again is almost appalling , " says a New Jersey woman who has had eight miscarriages and finally delivered a son who died in her arms of a rare lung disease five days after he was born . For chronic miscarriers , adoption is , of course , an alternative . But many couples are n't prepared for the wait , the red tape and the intense scrutiny that the adoption process frequently involves . " We went to see a lawyer and somehow we thought he 'd have a baby in his desk , " says Madeleine Blumenfeld of Sonoma , Calif. , who has had four miscarriages and is beginning to fear that time is running out . " Now we 're even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They say you ca n't be just a little bit pregnant ? Well , in my case , I can . " And even after adoption , some women still yearn to have a child emerge from their womb . " Actually making a baby is something very important to me . It makes me feel whole , " says Nancy Weitekamp , 36 , of Raymond , Ill. , who is pregnant again after three miscarriages , an ectopic pregnancy and adopting six children . It is that intense and primal longing that drives some chronic miscarriers to endure years of tests and experimental treatments and to insist that their doctors research every possible cause . The need to be fruitful and multiply is a thing of beauty , an impulse to be adored and respected ? and sometimes , sadly , to be feared . @# NEWSWEEK : AUGUST 15 , 1988 49
