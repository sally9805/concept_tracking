In Charlestown <P> After seven years of premeditation , blood was shed beside a so-called cradle of American liberty , Boston . <P> Guilty or not , justly or not , Nicola Sacco , clean-shaven factory worker , and Bartolomeo Vanzetti , mustachioed fish-peddler , were informed last Monday evening that they must die that midnight for the murders-which to the end they denied committing-of a paymaster and guard at South Braintree , Mass. , in 1920 . <P> Prisoners Sacco and Vanzetti refused last rites from the prison priest . They would die as they had lived , they said . Faith in a communistic order of mankind was enough for them . <P> Five guards took their posts in the death house , two to adjust electrodes , one at the blue lethal door , two to call at the cells . One newsgatherer , W. E. Playfair of the Associated Press , was included among the seven official witnesses of man killing man . <P> Prisoners Sacco and Vanzetti died in the order that their names had long been coupled , seven minutes apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
