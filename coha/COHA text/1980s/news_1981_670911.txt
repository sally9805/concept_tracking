Today , storytelling is being cultivated as an art form in a groundswell of attention that began in the early 1970 ' s , according to the National Storytelling Center in Jonesborough , Tenn. , a major national storytelling organization . And marking the renascence this weekend will be the first New York Story Telling Conference , a twoday convocation of professional storytellers sponsored by Columbia University ' s Maison Fran , caise in the university ' s East Hall on College Walk , at Broadway and 116th Street. // The Parisian storyteller Muriel Bloch will tell stories in French and English . Duyee Chang will sing the ancient Ponsori tales of Korea . Ibeke Jotayo will tell African stories . Tales from closer to home will be related by such tellers as Diane Wolkstein , longtime official New York City storyteller . There will be discussions on aspects of storytelling . And listeners will be invited to tell their own stories during the sessions both tomorrow and Sunday. // The idea of a conference originated with Laura Simms , a nationally known storyteller and founder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a member of the theater department at Columbia , who met at a seminar on myth at Maison Fran , caise in October . " Sonya was completely turned on by the response of the audience to the stories read and the feeling of intimacy afterward , " Miss Simms recalls . " I told her I had been trying to raise funds for a storytelling festival that would include a symposium on the nature of transposing cultures in a changing world . But this is a ' touchstone ' conference , where we bring together storytellers of varied style , form , age and background , in a situation that is both sophisticated and informal . " Another conference will follow , possibly in April , at La Mama Experimental Theater Center , on storytelling and the theater. // Why is storytelling so popular today ? " We are giving ourselves permission to hear again , " says Lynn Gottlieb , a young rabbi who will tell a story called " Revealing the Hidden " in a session Sunday on sacred stories . " This is a technological age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breakup and homogenization of cultures has put so much static in the air that we literally can ' t hear each other . People have moved into isolation . And we have these secondhand , two-dimensional modes of communication , like television and the newspaper , where the event is reduced to basic information . Storytelling is a full event . Its power is healing and affirmative , because storytelling is a full sharing that takes us out of loneliness. " // Miss Gottlieb was drawn into storytelling after learning to communicate in sign language as a rabbi to the deaf , and through conducting the ancient Rosh Hodesh or new-moon storytelling ritual for women ' s groups . She points out that religions are rooted in storytelling , whether dealing with the parables of Christ or the tales of the Baal Shem Tov , the Hasidic healer . Miss Simms describes storytelling as the " oldest theater art . " For Joe Heany , a Connemara-born seanchaidhe , or traditional teller and singer , storytelling is a way to bring back for an hour or two the rich oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories that last an hour , some even seven hours , " Mr. Heany says . " Once my grandfather took three months . On winter evenings people would come from work and gather by the fire from 8 to midnight . You could hear a pin drop . By December he said , ' Come back again after Christmas and I ' ll tell you the rest of the story . ' The Irish language can embellish a story in a way you can never repeat in English . " <> <> Of Myths and Epic Journeys // Storytelling , he says , goes back to the crucifixion - " there was supposed to be an Irishman there , too " - and long before Christ . And the best stories are the oldest stories of myths and epic journeys . " What dangers the travelers went through , whom they met and how they helped to solve their own and other people ' s problems along the way , " he says , describing the ingredients of a good tale. // " A yarn is not a good story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t educate anybody . Some believe that if you are buried on a wet day you go straight to heaven and if it ' s a fine day you go the other way . If you tell the story of the boy who set out to discover why his father , an easygoing , mild person like myself , was buried on a wet day and his mother , a vicious woman , was buried on a fine day , then that ' s what I call a story . It relates to the past , to a time when people used to walk miles and miles to get where they had to go . You don ' t see anything from a cab. " // Mr. Heany expects to tell the story of " Fairy Rock " at the conference . " It ' s about two miserable-looking hunchbacks and how the first plow was invented . The fairy rock is the biggest rock around , where the fairies hold seminars once a month and make their plans on how to treat people . " <> <> Is There a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a story ? It probably depends on whether you ask a traditionalist storyteller , who learned his tales from his grandfather , the folklorist who spends long years investigating the ways of his own and other cultures , or the originalist , who makes up his own stories . Mr. Heany believes that the best-told story is not acted out or accompanied by music . Pura Belpre , a writer , storyteller and much-loved specialist on Spanish children ' s programs for the New York Public Library , agrees . Miss Belpre will read three traditional tales that represent the cultures of Puerto Rico , starting with " Pedro and Martinez , " the love story of a mouse and a cockroach . This story , like some fairytale golden key , opened up a new life and work to her in the United States some 50 years ago. // " You have to be very careful of the voice modulation , " Miss Belpre says . " It ' s a good idea not to wear noisy jewelry on your arms . In fact , you must forget your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storytelling . " Not everyone agrees . Miss Gottlieb will chant her story , and invites her listeners to bring noisemakers to help with the telling. // The great African griot or storyteller Alhaj Bai accompanies himself on the stringed cora , and when Julia Haines tells a story he taught her , she will play the harp . Miss Simms describes storytelling as " sailing on a thin silk thread . " " I ' m the ferryman , " she says . " My listeners make the scenery . " Do children or adults tend to make the best " scenery " ? Miss Belpre finds children more " reciprocative . " " Children ! " Mr. Heany exclaims sadly . " I love them , and it ' s not their fault , but they ' ve been ruined by television , especially in this country . They turn it on and get Outer Space . They want a commercial between every two words . The older people want to hear something they ' ve never heard before . " <> <> An Unlikely Audience // As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most unlikely places . There was the time , she recalls , when she was hired to follow a rock band into a park in midtown Manhattan . But when the rock band left , it took along the portable stage , the microphone and the lunchtime audience . Miss Simms sat down at the edge of a fountain in her white , flowered summer dress and began to tell a story to a slowly accumulating crowd of derelicts , leaning against one another . " The ones who meant harm drifted off , " she said . " I looked into the eyes of the others and told them the story of the Black Prince . " This ancient Egyptian folk tale is about a very ugly flute player who sells his soul to be handsome , then finds that the princess he loves dreams only of the ugly boy who played the flute outside her window. // " ' That ' s like real life , ' " one of the derelicts said as I finished , " she recalled . " ' Hey , lady , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour and a half . But the second we dispersed , it was the longest walk of my life , getting out of that park. // " Another time I was at a Brooklyn school . ' Like man , we ' re not babies , ' one-fourth grader said . But after I ' d told them one story , the children all asked for another . At the end , I asked the children what would happen if there were no stories in the world . ' It would be a terrible problem , ' my convert said . ' You know , there are some people in the world who need a story to go to bed . And if there were no stories , those people would just wait , and wait , and wait. ' " // The first New York Story Telling Conference will take place from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. tomorrow and from 10 to 8 on Sunday . Tickets for two days are $20 ; for tomorrow only , $10 ; for Sunday only , $15 . No reservations may be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 280-3962 this afternoon. //
