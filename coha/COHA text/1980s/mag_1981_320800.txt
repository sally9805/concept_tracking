After a week of 18-hr , workdays , Baltimore Mayor William Donald Schaefer , 59 , likes nothing better than to devote a little more time to his one true love . He putters around the city 's familiar alleyways in a 1975 Pontiac , gleefully noting potential sites for redevelopment , shaking his head at uncollected garbage , scowling at potholes . His observations fill pad after pad of " Mayor 's Action Memos " - acerbic calls for remedial action that will be issued to his staff on Monday morning . Example : " Why is an abandoned car ... still visible to me and invisible to the impounders of illegally parked vehicles ? " <P> These days much of what Schaefer sees on his weekend inspections pleases him . In the ten years since he assumed office , Baltimore has blossomed . The once dingy downtown of the nation 's ninth largest city ( pop . 783,300 ) gleams with the glass , steel and fountains of Charles Center , a $175 million commercial complex . The 240 acres surrounding the city 's formerly decrepit docks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum and Harborplace , a stylish arcade of restaurants and emporiums developed by James Rouse , creator of Boston 's Quincy Market . A $21.5 million aquarium containing more than 5,000 specimens will open in September . As the city 's crumbling row houses have been refurbished , so has the spirit of its citizens . A local version of " I Love New York " appears on bumper stickers and buttons around town : BALTIMORE IS BEST . <P> Whether or not they believe that slogan , many Baltimoreans are inclined to agree with Maryland Congressman Steny Hoyer that their mayor is " the best in the country . " Like New York City 's Koch , Schaefer is a lifelong bachelor who returns his city 's enthusiasm with total attention and visceral emotion . He will storm , fume and curse when he feels Baltimore 's interests have been slighted . He cheers frenetically at Colt and Oriole games . He hoards trinkets and tokens from municipal events . Schaefer has never left his birthplace and still shares a West Side row house with his mother Tululu , 86 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College and the University of Baltimore , which gave him a 1943 law degree . An industrious servant of the local Democratic machine , he spent twelve years working his way up to president of the city council , a post he held for four years before winning the 1971 mayoral race with 85% of the vote . <P> To encourage the renovation and repopulation of the city 's dying neighborhoods , he instituted a " sweat equity " homesteading program , offering abandoned buildings to urban pioneers for $ 1 if they would promise to inhabit and improve the property . To sweeten the deal , Schaefer 's administration provided low-interest home-improvement loans . Incentives for commercial development have been equally unorthodox . In 1976 he created the Baltimore Economic Development Corporation ( BEDCO ) , an efficient , privately operated agency that acts as a one-stop clearinghouse for businesses seeking building sites and financing in Baltimore .
