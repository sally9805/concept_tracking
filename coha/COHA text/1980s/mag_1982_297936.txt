Watch that tilt , says the new Humanities Endowment head <P> In the fall of 1980 , the conservative Heritage Foundation , at the request of incoming Reagan Administration officials , prepared a provocative critique . One target : the National Endowment for the Humanities , the agency created by Congress in 1965 to provide federal grants to humanities projects . Among other criticisms , the foundation 's report excoriated the NEH for funding " grant proposals whose character is at best faddishly innovative , " and warned against " federalizing " the nation 's cultural programs and institutions . " The NEH , " the policy study said , " must not become the fat boy in the canoe , likely by its bulk to upset the delicate balance between public and private support . " <P> A major contributor to that report was William J. Bennett , then director of the National Humanities Center in North Carolina . But since December , Bennett , who holds degrees in law and philosophy from Harvard and the University of Texas and has taught at both institutions , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new NEH chairman . <P> <P> Very quickly , under Bennett , the " fat boy " appears to have been put on a crash diet . From a fiscal 1981 allotment of $151 million , the NEH has been trimmed down to a proposed $96 million for fiscal 1983 . <P> Chairman Bennett is hardly complaining . " The budget proposed for ' 83 , " he says , " is a substantial amount of money . We can still do a large number of things . " But in his four months in office , Bennett , 39 , has aroused the suspicion of the arts and humanities constituencies around the country that the NEH will begin to reflect the partisan conservative attitudes of his political sponsors . <P> Last month Bennett provided worried onlookers with a crackling good controversy . He criticized the fact that an hour-long film , entitled From the Ashes ... Nicaragua Today , had been partly funded by a routine grant of $45,623 from the NEH. * <P> Shown on national television by PBS , the film , says Bennett , was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Bennett argued that the film presented a one-sided view of the Nicaragua story . One of the film 's defenders , Wisconsin Humanities Chairman Morton Rothstein , says , " While I personally would have preferred a more ' balanced ' presentation , I found it a stimulating presentation that shed light on a major public policy issue . " But Bennett insists that the content and methods of Nicaragua Today " do not fall within the humanities . "
