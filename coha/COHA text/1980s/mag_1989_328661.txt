The inhabitants of Hong Kong usually reserve their deepest passions for business , not politics . But last week , in the largest and most emotional outburst ever seen in the British colony , more than 500,000 demonstrators marched through Hong Kong 's narrow streets , waving pro-democracy banners and singing anthems like We Shall Overcome . Including the spectators who cheered and applauded , an estimated 1 million people , one-sixth of Hong Kong 's populace , turned out to proclaim their support for the embattled students in China . <P> The unprecedented outcry reflected Hong Kong 's growing anxiety over its return to China in 1997 . A sleek modern city on the South China Sea , Hong Kong has become a hotbed of capitalism during 147 years of British rule . But Britain 's sovereignty is set to run out under an Anglo-Chinese agreement reached in 1984 . Now Hong Kong 's residents , the vast majority of whom are descendants of refugees from the mainland , scrutinize the crisis in China for clues to the fate of the colony under Communist control . Declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TODAY 'S CHINA IS TOMORROW 'S HONG KONG . <P> Such forebodings have caused Hong Kong to react sharply to each twist and turn in the power struggle next door . The Hang Seng index , the main indicator of value of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , swung wildly throughout the week . After dropping nearly 11% on Monday , the index rose 9.3% the next day on signs that the Chinese crisis might be easing . But the continued unrest in China led to further whipsawing that left the index at 2765.67 when trading ended Friday , down a substantial 12% for the week . <P> While the stock market gyrated , the turmoil in China disrupted efforts to draft the Basic Law , which will serve as Hong Kong 's constitution after 1997 . Talks between Chinese and Hong Kong negotiators have been under way since 1985 . But two key Hong Kong representatives  --  Louis Cha , publisher of the Ming Pao newspaper group , and Anglican Bishop Peter Kwong  --  quit the 55- member drafting committee after Beijing declared martial law . <P> The walkouts forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were " temporarily unable to carry out our work as planned " because events in China " have done great damage to the Hong Kong people 's confidence in the Basic Law . " A preoccupied Beijing canceled a scheduled visit to the colony by Ji Pengfei , who heads China 's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs . Once discussions resume , Hong Kong is certain to bargain harder than ever for protection of its rights . <P> Half a world away , Britain watched the strife in China with acute concern . Nonetheless , the government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher intends to uphold its pledge to return Hong Kong to Chinese rule . " We can not back away from the 1984 agreement , " said a senior British diplomat . " We have signed it , and we are committed to it . " Said another high official : " Once the situation settles down in China , it could be for the better . If the reformers do come out on top , that would be more promising for Hong Kong 's future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformers appeared to be in retreat .
