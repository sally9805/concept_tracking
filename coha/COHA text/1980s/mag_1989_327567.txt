I had a small crisis this week . <P> I was staying at a very stylish hotel in New York City where I knew they always had a bathrobe in the closet , so I left mine at home . I had called room service for coffee , then discovered there was no robe . When the coffee came , I took a sheet off the bed and wrapped it around myself toga style to answer the door . I can imagine what the waiter thought . I can just see him going back to the kitchen and saying , " You 'll never guess what I saw in Room 1712 ! " <P>  --  From the campaign diary of Barbara Bush <P> America , meet Barbara Bush , taking center stage in national life just in the knick of time . Nancy Reagan had many good qualities , but she was , well , something of a strain : those rail-thin looks , that hard-edged show-biz glitter and no children or grandchildren around to mess things up . The country may be ready for a First Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her age ( 63 ) and her pearls ( fake ) . She sports sweats on the weekends with no intention of jogging , does her own hair , likes takeout tacos , devours mystery novels , poaches at the net in mixed doubles , teases her husband and speaks her mind . When she is home near her own bathrobe , she wears it outside to walk the dog . <P> Barbara Bush knows that the two-mile move from the Vice President 's 1893 Victorian mansion on Embassy Row to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is more than a change of Zip Codes . As she puts color-coded stickers on the furniture and pictures to signify what goes , what stays and what gets tossed out in this latest move , she is already nostalgic over life as Second Lady . " I got away with murder , " says the woman who allowed as how Nancy Reagan should have simply replaced the White House china a piece at a time instead of buying a whole new set , and who suggested that her husband strip down to disprove rumors that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her new post , she says , " I 'm now slightly more careful about what I say . " ( Pause ) " Slightly . " <P> On its face , First Ladyhood looks easy enough : one gets to live in a big house with a large yard , travel a lot and throw fancy dinner parties . Someone else cleans up . But the job  --  unpaid and with no days off  --  has its pitfalls . The person a pillow away from the presidency is held up to an undefined ideal ; she bears all America 's conflicting notions about women as wives , mothers , lovers , colleagues and friends . A First Lady should be charming but not all fluff , gracious but not a doormat , substantive but not a co-President . She must defend her husband and smile bravely when he says stupid things . She must look great , even fashionable , when a shower and clean clothes would suffice for anyone else ; possess perfect children though such critters do not exist in nature ; and traipse around the globe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with a good book . She has both a day and a night job , but is not allowed a profession of her own . Hardest of all , she has to appear to love every minute of it .
