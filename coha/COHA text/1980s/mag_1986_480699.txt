From a conversation between Francois Mitterrand and Marguerite Duras in the May 7-13 issue of L'Autre Journal , a new magazine published in Paris . The conversation took place in April at the Elysee Palace . Translated by Jean-Philippe Antoine . MARGUERITE DURAS : What if we talked about America ? FRANCOIS MITTERRAND : If you want to . DURAS : Is n't it rather strange , what happens in America ? MITTERRAND : Where ? In Alaska ? DURAS : In Alaska too . Laughter . ' In New York , in New Orleans , in Chicago . Americans like Reagan . MITTERRAND : Yes , he is very popular . DURAS : And it is with the approval of his people that he bombed Qaddafi . MITTERRAND : Indeed , he feels and expresses what his people feel and would like to express . DURAS : You know Reagan . Tell us who he is . MITTERRAND : He is a man of common sense , gracious and pleasant . He communicates through jokes , by telling ultra-California stories , by speaking mainly about California and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and God ? the Christian God . His time as goverror of California remains an important inspiration to him . He is not a man who dwells on concepts , yet he has ideas and clings to them . DURAS : Is he honest ? MITTERRAND : What do you mean , honest ? What does that mean to you ? DURAS : It means honest . MITTERRAND : That he does n't deceive his au-dience ? DURAS : No , that 's not what I mean . Let 's put it this way : Does he believe what he says ? MITTERRAND : Indeed . DURAS : Common sense can sometimes be very wise , as wise as intelligence itself . Maybe that 's the way it is with this country , at once civilized and savage . MITTERRAND : Ronald Reagan has an intuitive approach to things , and he is able to get the gist of the sophisticated documents his aides place in front of him . DURAS : One can not conceive of Reagan as the leader of any country but America . MITTERRAND : It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The American people are vibrant , powerful , full of energy , imagination , and character . Their continent is rich with extraordinary resources . They have an excellent university system . Put all these elements together and you have a great nation . But let 's not idealize it . This great nation knows it possesses an empire . And the very idea of empire is a gnawing disease . America will require great fortitude to resist What first strikes me about the United States 10 HARPERS MAGAZINE / AUGUST is the immensity of the territory it still has to explore . to develop , to farm . When you fly from New York to Los Angeles , you spend more than an hour over the red and white sands of the desert , cut here and there by the blue lines of rivers . You feel that the journey west has just begun , that we are still at the dawn of time . For the people below , each step is like a conquest . ought to have the same feelings flying over Siberia or the Brazilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DURAS : Salt Lake City , Henry Fonda , John Wayne , these names , this landscape , this sense of time : it 's American cinema , John Ford . Westerns are about the crossing of deserts ; their heroes , led astray by silence , belong to that solitude . MITTERRAND : Do n't forget that as soon as you leave this western , there is much noise , many people , freeways , interchanges , and jammed cities . DURAS : I hope that Americans will preserve this emptiness , that they will never build on the deserts . 1 used to he bored when I was in America , because you could talk about everything but politics . It was often deadly . Starting with the Vietnam War , Americans began , little by little , to change . MITTERRAND : I made several trips to America around that time . In the universities , in 1967 and 1968 , I met some very progressive young people . Their rhetoric was extremist and out of touch with reality ? idealistic . They were reproachful toward Europeans like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sufficiently engaged in the battles from which they imagined revolution would emerge . Once again , liberty had fired their spirit . Freedom , liberation ? an ancient music to which young hearts respond . The journey , the adventure , the departure . Kerouac symbolized this need to escape , to go wherever your steps lead , to get away . From what ? From convention ; from home . Maybe from ? who knows ? from oneself , from death . One is looking for a better world , or , rather , a different world , and that inevitably lies beyond the horizon . So one keeps walking , as long as there 's hope . What society could fulfill this aspiration ? None . It is a metaphysical quest , and politics provides no answers of this kind . Although no system will ever be able to satisfy those who harbor such a desire , I think that American democracy guarantees that the greatest number will enjoy a liberty that is genuine , lived , practical . This is n't so bad , even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America is the country I feel closest to , even though I 've never lived there . MITTERRAND : I would be very much at a loss living there . DURAS : But you do n't live with a city ; you live with people . If you know three people in New York , you are saved . Not to know anybody there is suicide . I love America , myself . I am a Rea. ganite . Would you have believed MITTERRAND : I think I have found that out ! I feel sympathy for Reagan as a man , less sympathy for his policies . Should he ever read this , I do n't think he would be surprised . DURAS : I think he is the incarnation of a kind of primal , almost archaic , power . He governs less with his intellect than with common sense . But I approve of this . And he does n't look for any-thing more than the approval of the American people . MITTERRAND : But Ronald Reagan is not only President of the United States . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DURAS : Good for us ! Thanks be to God ! It 's funny , he displays the same defiance toward the Soviet Union as would an old member of a European Communist party . All of a sudden , he recognized what kind of people the Russians are , and he will never turn his back on this knowledge . That 's it ? the great virtue of simplicity . You may be slow , but when you learn something , it 's forever , MITTERRAND : A raid in Grenada , a bombing in Tripoli ? certainly that 's within the reach of an empire . But that 's not necessarily what people expect from one . DURAS : I do n't think Reagan misuses his strength . He wants to kill Qaddafi the way any simpleton would if he felt he had been abused . But apart from that , he does n't misuse it . MITTERRAND : Tripoli seems ro think otherwise . I am , like you , a friend of the Americans , and even though my political ideas are very different from those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for the sake of diplomatic good manners . I recognize the critical role played by the United States whatever its flaws and fantasies ? in safeguarding a certain way of life for which , all in all , I care . But I am , first and foremost , a son and servant of France , an out-and-out European , and this Americans must not forget . Let us also recognize that in a country with as much liberty as the United States , one finds serious inequalities . Some statistics put the number of poor at 35 million . Enough to populate Spain . I have no doubt that President Reagan cares about this and agonizes over it . But the American system is responsible . DURAS : The system and , let me add , mankind . I wrote once that " ... the socialist man has remained a slave to his past . . . such that prosperity here is as impoverished as the destitution before .... " Sorry . I think poverty is sometimes associated with liberty , a choice . I do n't think those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet-style " prosperity " ? to be fed , housed , controlled , forbidden to travel and wander . Reagan is interesting to me from the point of view of power . His behavior is open and direct . He does not just make speeches . He explains what he wants to do and he does it . Here , lately , we have seen words so shamelessly abused , especially in the National Assembly . Political language becomes insupportable when it loses sight of the fact that words have consequences . Next to that of our politicians , Reagan 's language is a breath of fresh air . MI ! ( ERRAND : I do n't like to teach lessons when there are so many to be learned ! But misusing language is not a disease specific to the French . DURAS : No , your own caution is not just rhetorical ; it expresses what you really think . But could you ? since in this field you are the king ? say something about the relationship between language and politics ? MITTERRAND : The fit between Ronald Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . And I understand what you meant by describing Reagan 's power as " primal " : like a rock in the Morvan , like plain truth , like the wilderness of Nevada . But the problem is whether the state to which this language belongs is desirable . Once you have admired how well this language is adapted to the state it refers to , then you must look at the state itself . Is this state ? let me repeat myself ? desirable ? I. prefer to pose this question . DURAS : But without this state , you would n't have this language . That is why I reject your question . You are trying to draw me onto your ground , and since I am as stubborn as you are , I wo n't let you do it .... Reagan plays Reagan ; his praxis is day-to-day policies . He does n't want to he distracted from his mission : the defense of America , and therefore of the rest of the world . Americans are killed in Berlin , he bombs Tripoli . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Americanism . It 's only recently that Americans have gotten over the complex that Europe gave them , the complex of the shame of capitalism . MITTERRAND : Americans can be proud of their history , proud of themselves . But you do n't 12 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE / AUGUST bomb Tripoli to get rid of a complex . Your explanation is inadequate . I grant you that after Watergate and Qaddafi 's provocations , Americans needed to regain their trust in themselves . In this respect Ronald Reagan fulfills his mandate perfectly .... Jimmy Carter , who was a much better president than is generally thought , is to Americans today a symbol of what one should not do . He left them with a sense of hesitance and of doubt . Ronald Reagan is better able to translate his faith into action . DURAS : You have something there . That 's one of the keys to Reagan . Of course , it 's simple . But it 's not necessarily unattractive . MITTERRAND : Not necessarily . Indeed , it can even he appealing . DURAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift : a trip across America on the Zephyr , a train with panoramic windows , which traveled from New York or Chicago , I do n't remember , to San Francisco . I am not sure that it still exists . People said it was good for no one but honeymooners and retired couples . In the Rocky Mountains , it went so slowly that schoolchildren would step on hoard while it was in motion . In the rear of the train , there was a big , open drawing room with a balcony from which to watch the scenery . It stopped in Sacramento , the city where Chaplin shot The Gold Rush . MITTERRAND : It makes me dream , that train , that America ? the time it takes for a trip like that . DURAS : The trip took three and a half days . One full day of corn . One day of wheat . Then the deserts . Then the mountains . It 's sad to think that such a train may no longer exist . MITTERRAND : I know Salt Lake City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . The landscape forces you to look at the sky . You understand the Mormons perfectly . Not far from there , Death Valley beckons . And , another shock for me : the Grand Canyon . I speak like a postcard , but I was there on a day of lovely light , and I have never seen anything so beautiful . DURAS : Would n't you say breathtaking , rather than beautiful . MITTERRAND : Yes , breathtaking , but beautiful too . But I see what you mean . I imagine that the beauty of your crossing was the beauty of day-to-day things when they 're endowed with grandeur . But let us not ignore smaller details . Like everyone else , at the Grand Canyon , I stayed in a hotel ? a kind of fake ranch . And , like every tourist , I bought souvenirs . In particular , a walking stick . I am partial to walking sticks . I do n't need one , I 'm not lame , but it entertains me ; I swing it around my wrist , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when my dogs are along I can guide them better . A walking stick is a friend . So I bought a walking stick sculpted by Indians , with snakes and totems . And I carefully brought it back to France . Not that it was rare ? you could buy it just like that . But I liked it . Then one day , at home in Paris , I was playing with it when I saw a tiny label : made in Taiwan . A good lesson in exoticism ' A good lesson in economics ! What do they actually make in the Grand Canyon ? In the land of NASA , Nobel prizes , artificial organs , genetic engineering ?
