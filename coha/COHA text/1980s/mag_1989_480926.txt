When I lived in Greenwich Village twenty-five years ago , I had a friend who owned a filing cabinet and who kept carbon copies of his letters in one of those drawers . His room was on Avenue A , which in those days was only the unfashionable , Hispanic Lower East Side , and my friend 's dust balls , roaches , grit , and dangerous streets were at odds with the efficiency of four steel drawers that locked and the luxury of owning anything worth locking up . Of our downtown group all fledgling writers ? two of us had just fled graduate school and none of us was more than poor . My wife and 1 , with a budget for food of seven dollars a week , were the best off , and no editor of fiction seemed willing to make any of us richer or glad-der by publishing our work . So many of them told us , in scribbled notes and printed slips , that our writing did n't matter much ; I could not imagine , then , why our letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction and its rejection ? could warrant keeping . Surely , I figured , copies of those letters would be worth even less . But my friend , with his one scuffed sport coat and his roomful of darkness and wildlife , insisted that his papers would one day be important . Frederick Busch is the author of Absent Friends , a collection of stories , published recently by Knopf . Two new novels , War Babies and Harry and Catherine , will be published in September and March , respectively . He was going to be prepared . As far as I know , the world never has come to love his work or demand his documents . But they are , now , important not for what they say but for what they signify . The recent legal contest over Ian Hamilton 's biography of J. D. Salinger is final proof that the disposition of the letters of writers , mute and inglorious or otherwise , is a matter of ethical as well as literary concern . The law , as interpreted in the decision for Salinger in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter writer 's language ? the contents of his letters ? belongs to him ; the paper that is host to the language belongs to the letter 's recipient . Hamilton and his publisher wanted to directly quote and extensively paraphrase what Salinger said to others . Apparently , some of those others did n't mind . But Salinger did , and he insisted on his right to privacy ? and , legally , his right to the profit his words might generate ? while publishers and scholars , in a burst of self-serving talk about scholarship and public service , insisted on the reader 's alleged need ( some call it a right ) to know . Most of us are n't like Salinger ; we possess neither his talent nor his mysterious extraliterary appeal . Yet even if none among us is the reflection of the glimmer of a wish that he or she approach his genius , we have a stake in the debate over the disposition of a writer 's private ( or pri58 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE/AUGUST 1989 vately intended ) words . For libraries are buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers ' papers . Although one writer may decide to sell his manuscripts but not his correspondence , another may decide to sell everything ? a buck 's a buck , and we 're all still underpaid . I learned this recently while corresponding with the curator of Ohio State 's William Charvat American Fiction Collection . He and the collection purchased all the manuscripts and papers ( research , notes , first drafts , etc. ) , but no letters , pertaining to my first ten books . We 've kept in touch . He wrote , a while ago , to tell me how a colleague and writing friend , who is also the editor of a literary magazine , had recently sold his papers to the collection . In the papers , the curator said , were twenty-six letters from me . I had no warning that the sale was to take place , but I suppose I 'd only have whimpered and begged . And though the editor should have asked , there 's no assurance of receiving courtesy at every turn . But , I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this man about his magazine , his own poetry and fiction , and about my fiction . He had published two stories of mine , and we had , I guess , discussed pertinent details . We were interested in a number of the same writers . But what , I wondered , had I said about them ? Unlike my friend on Avenue A in 1964 , I do n't keep copies of my letters . What had I said about writers I did n't like ? about editors he and I reviled ? about , good heavens , reviewers ? Feeling vulnerable , and with reason , I wrote to the Charvat Collection 's curator and , well , complained . I told him that while I did n't mind people looking at my manuscripts , since they 'd he doing so out of presumably serious interest in my work , I was appalled that they might look at my letters . Why would they want to do that ? I asked . Out of the same serious interest , the curator replied . And , he reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission . Could they paraphrase ? I asked . Indeed they could . Could they summarize , sketch out , what " was n't fully said ? In other words , could they obey the law but violate me ? Yes , the curator told me , they could in which case the courts might be involved again . But Salinger is bigger than Busch , and potion , an art , is a public display . My novels he can afford a dozen more lawyers . and stories are about characters . I clothe them the world to see for the world to see : I invite them . It is n't inconceivable that people write novels in order to find a way of going out into the world in disguise . On the other hand , my letters are about me ; in them , I 'm in plain sight . Furthermore , I think that writers write letters as a way of clearing the throat , of warming up the vocal cords , as preparation for the real thing . In a similar way , a painter might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In letter writing preparatory to the writing of fiction , the subconscious mind is summoned , and its tones and secrets gradually come up and onto the pages . But it is in the fiction , I suggest , in the formal art , that the lower layers of the mind are more controlled by a story 's purpose or the shape of a character 's life . One writes to a friend and expresses the anger , frustration , silliness , and excitement that ca n't be fitted into the narrative , that is , after all ? or that should be ? about someone-else-on-the-page , no matter how much self festers beneath that someone . We do so much , in our work , about otherness . Our characters must be " not-ourselves . " Our art must be practiced in isolation no matter how much we teach or attend conferences or symposiums . Our real letters to the world , our stories and novels , are read by so few , to such apparent small effect , that publication , after lonely writing , often makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chat of professionals exchanging secrets , indulging in loose talk about editors , publishers , and critics ( those cousins so often dangerous to us ) . They are confidences , and we need to trade them . Ira not so certain , now , that all of us always will . I write a lot of letters to a dear friend in New York , and she writes back to me . We amuse each other , inform each other , and we heap the occasional excoriation . Among our mutual targets is a book editor , X. We have both worked with him . We agree that for undeserved self-appreciation and pomposity this person is unmatched . We 've said so , in the nasty , clever ways that writers do when they are showing off for one another , comforting one another , and helping one another to be patient while waiting for fiction to happen . Now X is not evil , we would hasten to say . X is simply careless and inept and tedious . For this , X should not be publicly flayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and suggested that he 'd like to obtain her papers . He mentioned this to me , saying how pleased he was at the prospect of acquiring not only this wonderful writer 's manuscripts but also lots of letters from other writers , including me . Suddenly , she and i agreed , X was in real danger of his public life , and she and I were placed in the position of being dangers to each other . So we made a deal . We 're going to keep our letters out of everyone 's archives as long as we are given a say . And we 're going to see that our correspondence is ashed at about the time that we are . Bumbling , braying X is not the only soul at stake . A lot of us have said remarkable stuff about one another in intimate correspondence . We are none of us safe . I can not imagine a more fangy , gossipy lot than fiction writers . Our work has much , after all , to do with make-believe gossip made plausible . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who hurt us , or who seem as though they could , are always on our minds and in our margins , coming close , always closer , to the center of our pages and our discourse . Charles Dickens wrote in his will , " I rest my claims to the remembrance of my country upon my published works , and to the remembrance of my friends upon their experience of me . " He did n't mention leaving letters , so many of which he burned , from his friends . And he did n't mention being remembered by his own letters , many of which were suppressed by his family and his first biographer , John Forster . But Forster did , after Dickens 's death , publish an autobiographical fragment , in which Dickens reveals the awful pain he felt when his family lived in the Marshalsea prison with his father , who was imprisoned for debt , and he , a scared boy , lived alone in the pandemonium of London and worked in a shoe-blacking factory . The fragment was given by Dickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an autobiographical book but found that he could n't face his memories . He never told his family , in fact , of the story behind the fragment ; they learned of it after his death . But Forster , his confidant , published it in his Life of Charles Dickens , and readers of Dickens 's fiction may read it to understand the isolated , terrified children whose cause he so wonderfully championed . ( They may even see how Dickens plundered his own confidential , letter-like document when he wrote David Copperfield . In his fiction he was clothed . ) Should we grope beneath the clothing worn in public by writers we think of as ours ? Let 's snoop , for the sake of this question , on the intimate lives of others . Here 's Franz Kafka , in 1921 , writing to author Max Brod about the women in Kafka 's life : As long as she withheld herself from me ( F ) or as long as we were one ( M ) , it was only a menace from far away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the slightest little thing happened , everything collapsed . Evidently on account of my dignity , on account of my pride no matter how humble he looks , the devious West European Jew ! ) , I can love only what I can place so high above me that can not reach it . Kafka , who also wanted his manuscripts burned , and whose work is so often about a vengeful disappearance or transformation , could not have wanted us to know how well he wrote of how badly he loved . And I wonder if Edna St. Vincent Millay would have been pleased to , know that we know what she wrote , also in 1921 , to poet Arthur Davison Ficke : I know you ca n't come to Europe , but you could come to New York , because you often do , to see Hal , or somebody , &; do n't you love me most as much as you love Hal !  - -  - I think we might have a few days together that would be entirely lovely . We are not children , or fools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to do the mad thing well . I like the closing sentences . Maybe they could help me study or lecture on Edna St. Vincent Millay 's poetry . But I wonder how essential my peek into this woman 's privacy ? and Ficke 's and Hal 's ? has been : do the poems work as well for me if I do n't know the letter ? Does my sense of Herman Melville 's growing dark powers increase if I know that , in 1851 ? the letter does seem to be more ardor than art ? he wrote to Nathaniel Hawthorne to ask , " Whence come you , Hawthorne ? By what right do you drink from my flagon of life ? And when I put it to my lips ? lo , they are yours and not mine . " Melville was a private soul . How , then , would he feel about our peering at his hymn , meant for Hawthome 's eyes , to Hawthorne 's lips ? Ernest Hemingway shows a softer , more wounded side than some might expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his second wife , after they had betrayed her friend and his first wife , Hadley . He tells Pfeiffer , and inadvertently us , that Last fall I said perfectly calmly and not bluffingly and during one of the good times that if this was n't cleared up by Christmas I would kill myself ? because that would mean it was n't going to clear up ... and evidently all I can do is to remove the sin out of your life and avoid Hadley the necessity of divorce ? and compliment Hadley ? by killing myself . If Hemingway means what he says , he shows decency toward his Catholic lover and his hurt wife . And whether or not he is sincere , there is much for scholars in this suicide 's son speculating on suicide . Have the scholars a right to such intimate agonies ? Twenty-five years later Hemingway , in a different mood , writes to Charles Scribner about James Jones 's From Here to Eternity ? clearly an unwelcome competitor in the lists of novels on war : Probably I should re-read it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to eat an entire bowl of scabs to know they are scabs ; nor suck a boil to know it is a boil ; nor swim through a river of snot to know it is snot . I hope he kills himself as soon as it does not damage his or your sales . The letter in its entirety is even crueler and more infantile , pulsing with jealousy . Note , though , the suicide motif . Must the scholar know about it ? I understand Hemingway , I suppose , somewhat better after reading these letters of his . I do n't know how much I understand his fiction in their light . And is n't he important because of the fiction , not these little lights ? Hemingway grew careful about his letters , after a while , and he even at times asked for their return . How careful , I wonder , are other writers now ? What effect will such care have on their letter writing and then , of far more importance , on the fiction writing that correspondence is so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he told how , as a boy , he had viewed a public hanging : I remember what a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain , &; how the tight black silk gown set off her shape as she wheeled half-round &; back . His erotic apprehension ? the wet silk molding itself to her breasts and belly and thighs ? is fascinating , since it is a dead woman over whom he exults . The fine writing in that description speaks significantly to his novels . But Hardy wrote it to a Lady Pinney . That moment was theirs . Yet he cared so much about his reputation that he dictated his biography to his wife . I think that he would n't want us to know of his written intimacy with Lady Pinney. dell , here I am , then , good as can he : willing to plunder my betters , as Ian Hamilton was his , for the sake of what I need to say . My own profit is behind that willingness . And 1 am unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My little squeals of anguish , my occasional grunt of joy , must , finally , be of such small importance in a literary world that teems with contestants , voluntary and otherwise , for attention of any sort . I am learning that this is an age in which gossip is a food sanctioned by scholars ? demanded by them ? for the appeasement of hungers such as tenure and promotion . Non-academics , such as Peter Manse : , whose 1985 biography , Mailer , seems sired by People , work side-by-side with professors to plunder the inner lives of poets and novelists . It is decadence , though some may call it scholarship , when a writer 's work matters less than his secrets , when there is cash on hand for what he dashes off , though not for what he labors to create . I intend these as no final words . There must be letters meant , no matter how transmitted , to be public . And there are arguments , 1 guess ? see me use the excerpts from letters , above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean to provoke debate . I asked the curator of the Charvat Collection at Ohio State whether he would consider writing something about the matter , and he suggested that I write what " would simply be an inquiry into what you phrase as ' the need of the writers ? the essential right ? to speak in confidence . ' I am already quoting from your letters , " he wrote in his letter to me , from which I quote .
