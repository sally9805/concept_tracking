Last week Soviet troop planes swooped into Yerevan , capital of the Armenian republic . The soldiers who alighted and began patrolling the streets with tanks and armored vehicles were charged with a delicate mission : to calm the latest and most volatile outburst of ethnic unrest so far in Armenia and the % neighboring republic of Azerbaijan . The show of force indicated that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev was eager to halt the regional conflict , which has become an embarrassing distraction from his goal of reforming Soviet political and economic life , as well as a potential weapon in the hands of his enemies . <P> The turmoil centered once again on the largely Armenian enclave of Nagorno- Karabakh , a part of Azerbaijan since 1923 . Trouble began when Azerbaijani attacked a busload of Armenian students near the regional capital of Stepanakert in Nagorno-Karabakh . Fighting spread swiftly as roving bands set fire to houses and cars . Ethnic Armenians and Azerbaijani battled with knives and guns in the worst outbreak of violence since 32 people died last February in riots in Sumgait , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , authorities imposed a military curfew . The Soviet news agency TASS said one Armenian had been killed and 48 other people injured in the fighting . <P> News of the violence inflamed passions in Yerevan , where residents are still furious over Moscow 's refusal last July to grant their petition to allow Armenia to annex Nagorno-Karabakh .

Several demonstrators tore up their Communist Party cards . <P> More than 1,000 Soviet troops sealed off Lenin Square , which houses the Armenian Supreme Soviet Building . Three tanks circled the square and then drove off . Elsewhere , troops set up roadblocks on streets leading to and from Yerevan while others waited in armored personnel carriers at the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said an irate citizen . " Why do they need tanks here ? " <P> The unrest is placing Gorbachev in an increasingly difficult position . If the Soviet leader meets Armenian demands , he risks fanning nationalist sentiments that smolder across the country . But if he can not resolve the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh , opponents may argue that the strife exposes the dangers of letting Soviet citizens speak their minds so freely . Both sides may have a point . As Armenian protesters continued to speak out last week , some went so far as to call for Armenian secession from the Soviet Union unless Nagorno-Karabakh can be annexed .
