A film maker bites the bullet on his $36 million fiasco <P> It was not supposed to be a disaster movie . It was supposed to be a western . But when the New York critics saw Michael Cimino 's $36 million Heaven 's Gate at its first screening last Tuesday , they deemed it " an unqualified disaster . " Executives at United Artists , who had bankrolled Cimino 's eulogy to the Old West but never , until that moment , seen it in its final form , were scurrying to anxious meetings , acting out the **30;9516;TOOLONG scene from The Titanic . Cimino must have wished he were in Airport-any airport . After all , his previous film , The Deer Hunter , won the Academy Award for Best Picture . This time out , he could only bite the bullet and petition his patrons " to temporarily withdraw Heaven 's Gate from distribution to allow me to present to the public a finished film with the same care and thoughtfulness with which we began it . " Within 24 hours , from his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to withdraw and recut it , Cimino had gone from Heaven to Hell . And from nearly every movie mavin came the cackle of contumely : the arrogant director had committed career harakiri . <P> Even before Cimino 's spectacular immolation , the evidence on the screen portended commercial disaster . Heaven 's Gate is a serious western , a genre that has not spawned a popular hit in more than a decade . The film 's stars-Kris Kristofferson , Christopher Walken and French Actress Isabelle Huppert-have never provoked stampedes to the box office , and they light no sparks here . The film moves at a glacial pace toward degradation and death : when the cavalry rides to the rescue , it saves the bad guys . The movie 's narrative is as incoherent , its plot points as contradictory , its characters as inarticulate ( and , through the wonders of Dolby Stereo , often as unintelligible ) as those of The Deer Hunter , but without the Viet Nam film 's claim of political significance . With its repetitions and ellipses , Heaven 's Gate resembles random sequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , it is something sadder : a four-hour fiasco . <P> And yet there is grandeur in this folie . Cimino 's voluptuous romantic imagination and the dusky imagery of Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond produced breathtaking panoramas of majestic landscape and milling hordes . A hundred happy couples waltz in circles within circles in Harvard Yard ; 20 years later and 2,500 miles west , another hundred couples roller-skate to fiddle music in a cow-town grange hall . In Cimino 's Wyoming , it is never high noon ; everything happens in misty morning or dusty dusk , so the oblique , ruminative sunlight can memorialize every moment . Some viewers with educated eyes found scenes of beauty in Heaven ' s Gate . Others wished they 'd brought their Murine.
