They may have been singing Amazing Grace , but when Willie Nelson and his backup singers Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter took to the stage last week , it was Plains , Ga. , that was on their minds . As a longtime friend , Nelson was there in his bushier-than-ever beard to help the Carters celebrate their hometown 's 100th birthday . The party began with a five-mile road race ; the former - President and still earnest jogger came in 314th out of 437 with a time of 40:35 . He did better during the parade down Main Street , leading the way with Rosalynn past 7,000 cheering visitors and kinfolk . Brother Billy is both these days , and he was spotted on the edge of the crowd , having dropped by from Waycross , Ga. , where he works for a mobile-home manufacturer . Glad to be home , Billy ? " Not really , " he grinned . " I do n't get back much , except to pass through . I 'm happy where I am. "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
