? s a boy in Indianapolis 50 . ' years ago , I certainly would n't have predicted that I would some  --  day represent Alaska in the U.S. Senate . Alaska was n't even a state then ; in our geography and history classes , we learned about a vast territory with little chance of becoming a state . Alaska was as remote to me then as the struggle for statehood is now to the genera  --  tion that has grown up since the 49th star was added to the flag . The excitement and celebration the day statehood was assured in Alaska have never quite been du  --  plicated , although a special vitality remains . It 's apparent in the at titudes of most Alaskans today  --  that anything can be accomplished . The years leading up to the sign  --  ing of the statehood act began in 1916 . Alaskans repeatedly peti  --  tioned Congress for statehood sta  --  tus , but the requests never made it through the legislative process . Yet some Alaskans kept plug  --  ging . Their names are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska reads of their struggle . Congressional delegates James Wickersham , A.J. Dimond and Bob Bartlett , later senator , con tinued to push for statehood . But Alaska 's lone , nonvoting delegate Senate . Those of us working in Washington , D.C. , knew that the Senate would have to pass the House bill without amendment . If the Senate altered the bill , it would have to go back to the House for approval , giving the House Rules Committee the opportunity to kill the bill as it had in previous years . Opponents of statehood in the Senate tried to attach controversial and often unrelated amendments , but Alaska 's friend and neighbor , the late Sen. Henry " Scoop " Jack  --  son of the state of Washington , led bipartisan support for the state  --  hood bill on the Senate floor and successfully fended off efforts to change the bill . On June 30 , 1958 , the Senate passed the bill by a 64-20 vote . The battle for statehood was won . The Senate erupted with cheers , and the gallery , filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rules and clapped and cheered as well . Within minutes , Alaskans across the state received the news , and pandemonium was the order of the day . People poured into the streets to shake hands and slap one another on the back . The people of Fairbanks tried to dye the Chena River gold and floated a 30-foot star bearing the numeral 49 over the downtown area . Anchorage citizens lit a huge bonfire using one ton of wood for each of the 49 states and an addi  --  tional ton for Hawaii , whose cause for statehood Alaskans well under  --  stood . The Anchorage Times took up half its front page with the headline " WE 'RE IN ! " A few days after Senate ap  --  proval , President Eisenhower signed the bill and made the of  --  ficial date of entry into the Union January 3 , 1959 . We had realized our first goal . No longer would Alaskans travel to " the States " when they went to the Lower 48 . They were a state ; they would merely travel " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that new generation , have some different goals and concerns from those held by the men and women who fought for statehood . They also share some of the problems still to be solved after 25 years . With statehood , Alaskans won a voice in their state 's destiny , and we 've been a vociferous group ever since . We have worked to extend the benefits of education and com  --  munication throughout our state and have begun development of our great natural resources without reducing our commitment to protec  --  ting Alaska 's natural wonders . Cur  --  rent assesments show that fewer than 200,000 of our 375 million acres have been touched by man , either through settlement or resource development . Our population has more than doubled since statehood , and this year we reached the half-million mark , census estimates say . 88 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST July/August ' 84 the place . When I finally got there , this awful woman said , " You 're on next ; come on , let 's go . " I said , " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have n't got time , get on the stage . " So I walked out with my regular face and this booker was there . He said to me , " Do n't ever put that stuff on . You 've got a face that saves jokes . " Stoddard : After all these years , do you feel any tension when you go on at those Kennedy Center bashes or command performances ? Hope : Nothing bothers me about that . Stoddard : Did it ever ? Hope : Yes , it used to get me a little uptight . But being in vaudeville , I was used to getting up and telling jokes . When we were n't working , some nights I 'd play three benefits , just walk in , do 10 or 12 minutes , go out , get in the car , go to another theater , walk on , do the same thing . Stoddard : Will you be going to the Olympics ? Hope : I 'm going to Victoria , British Columbia , sit back and watch it on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were at Eagle River , Wisconsin , in a beautiful cottage , and we just played golf and then came back and watched the Olym  --  pics . But I got tickets for the kids ; they want to see all the events . SerVaas : It 's five o'clock , and I 'm afraid we must be keeping you past the . . . Hope : I do have an appointment . SerVaas : Thank you for your great hospitality . Stoddard : It 's been wonderful . Hope : Walking with us to the door Thank you for coming . If you should run into a big , white guard dog on the way out , just give him my name . We crossed the court  --  yard much faster than when we came in. ) i4 Alaska continued from page 65 ANCSA to administer the terms of the act in the best interests of the Eskimos , Aleuts and Indians in each region . Some of those corporations are among Alaska 's most prominent business enterprises today . Then , in November 1973 , Presi  --  dent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the haul road , now the Dalton High  --  way , began the next spring and was completed by fall . The first pipe was installed in March 1975 , and on June 20 , 1977 , the first oil left Prud  --  hoe Bay for the terminal in Valdez . In 1980 , Alaska 's lands were once again in the nation 's headlines . The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act ( ANILCA ) , often called the d-2 Lands Bill , affected some 131 million acres of Alaskan land . A compromise bill enacted after seven years of debate , it cre  --  ated new conservation units after President Jimmy Carter had with  --  drawn 114 million acres from possi  --  ble selection and consideration as part of the state 's land . Implementation of the d-2 bill continues today . For now , say the word " d-2 " in a group of a dozen Alaskans , and you 'll get a dozen points of view . But we 're trying to understand and resolve our differ  --  ences while assuring that lands of truly national significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the Great Land and what the nation knows as our last frontier . Those scenic wonders are what make tourism Alaska 's third-largest industry today . But how many people know that Alaska 's commer  --  cial fish production is greater in value than that of any other state , or that Alaska 's 47,000 miles of tidal shoreline provide some of the finest sport fishing in the world , as well ? How many know that Alaska is the center of a growing trade with the Pacific-rim nations ? U.S. ship  --  ping restrictions hamper the growthof that trade , but Alaskans are working on those problems , too . Along with its people and its scenery and its natural resources , Alaska offers much in the way of unique native arts and crafts , a source of pride to all its citizens . Music is a very special part of most Alaskans ' lives . Music festivals throughout the state draw enthus  --  iastic fans . Alaskans ' commitment to sports is beginning to be recognized out  --  side its borders . Last winter , the World Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice when the planned site on the East Coast failed to come up with enough snow . The 1,049-mile Iditarod dog-sled race is scrutinized by national and international news teams each March , and top basketball teams from colleges across the nation par  --  ticipate in the Great Alaskan Shoot-out every winter . Needless to say , hockey has par  --  ticipants and fans of every age in Alaska . And would you believe there are 350 softball teams in An  --  chorage alone ? That means 6,500 players , men and women , wearing team uniforms and running the bas  --  es on ball fields from dawn to dusk . Before the snow is off the ground , tennis buffs are clearing the courts . Skiers can ski almost year-round at Alyeska , Alaska 's largest resort , a bustling Alpine village one hour from Anchorage . High-school basketball and track teams routinely fly hundreds of miles to participate in tournaments . Check the rosters of any major-league baseball team in the Ameri  --  can or National Leagues . You 'll likely find that at least one of their stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People , natural resources , sports , art , mountains , rivers , fjords , com  --  merce , trade , crisp air , eagles and other wildlife  --  they 're all part of Alaska . Alaskans ' specific challenge today is to plan carefully for the next quarter century and to use their col  --  lective voice to work toward being stewards of the state 's unique re  --  sources while fulfilling their respon  --  sibilities as a member of the Union . In the year 2009 nothing would please me , the framers of our consti  --  tution or all Alaskans more than at  --  taining our goals as successfully as we have during our first 25 years .
