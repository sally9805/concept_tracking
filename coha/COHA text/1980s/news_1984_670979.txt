Mondale strategists say they will spend more than $3 million for television advertising in the state and are also planning to have Mr. Mondale fly in for a rally next week on the final day of the general election campaign. // These plans are linked to a broader strategy that holds Mr. Mondale must win at least one of the major Sun Belt states if he is to win the election , now just nine days away. // <> <> Upbeat Mood is Fading // But the upbeat mood that prevailed among Mondale strategists as they planned their California offensive has faded over the last two days . Polls in the state that track shifts in voters ' positions have detected a drift toward Mr. Reagan that , while not so dramatic as the national trend , has shaken Democratic hopes about making California a foundation for an upset victory in the national election on Nov. 6. // According to Mondale campaign officials , these tracking polls showed Mr. Reagan ' s lead expanding from 8 points to 10 to 11 points in California . Reagan campaign officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in the state. // Both figures are below the 18-point national lead for Mr. Reagan in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll . All the figures are subject to sampling errors and some voters could shift their positions , but some Mondale aides fear that the new California findings show that the President has gained the upper hand in a pivotal contest for electoral votes in what Reagan strategists call " the battle for the Sun Belt megas tates. " // <> <> Focus on Three States // The struggle in the Sun Belt , in turn , underscores the intensity , precision and political importance of the broader contest being waged by the two camps now that their attention has turned to the electoral-vote impact of the campaign. // Most political experts have long believed that California , Texas and Florida , the three largest Sun Belt states , might hold the key to Mr. Reagan ' s hopes for a second term or to Mr. Mondale ' s dream of pulling off the biggest upset since the Presidential election of 1948. // The arithmetic of the electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidate can get the 270 electoral votes required for election , strategists often think of the states in clusters : the Deep South , the mountain West , the Farm Belt of the Middle West , the Rust Belt states around the Great Lakes , and the industrial Northeast , encompassing New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania and New England. // Because of Mr. Reagan ' s strength in the Deep South and the inland West , Mondale strategists chose the Northeastern and Middle Western states as the areas where they would have to get their main bundle of electoral votes . But it has also long been apparent to both sides that Mr. Mondale probably could not get an electoral majority without breaking Mr. Reagan ' s hold on at least one of the three big Sun Belt states he carried in 1980 . Thus , in 1984 , Florida , Texas and California have come to be regarded as a cluster , not by virtue of geographic proximity , but because of their large populations and the similarities in their economic , political and meterological climates. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electoral votes , and the three-megastate anchor of the Sun Belt is Texas , California and Florida , " said Lee Atwater , deputy director of the Reagan campaign . " It became clear to us very early in this contest that if we nailed down the West and South with those three states as an anchor that we could spend the rest of the campaign challenging him on his turf . " California ' s 47 Electoral Votes // He added , " In effect , they have written off Florida and Texas , and they ' re chasing California , which is a political mirage in my judgment. " // Mondale strategists deny that they have written off Texas , but no one disputes the central importance of California , with its 47 electoral votes , to the battle for the Sun Belt. // As the Democrats ' prospects dimmed in Florida , with 21 electoral votes , and Texas , with 29 , they poured resources into California at a go-for- broke pace .

Ferraro , and Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Gary Hart of Colorado are campaigning furiously in the state. // Reagan advisers estimated that the Mondale campaign ' s saturation advertising on television had already cost $1. 3 million as of a week ago . In the days ahead , Californians will be exposed to the heaviest advertising blitz of this election year and what Joe Trippi , the Mondale manager in the state , calls " the two largest media buys " in California political history . <> <> What the Polls Show // " It ' s boggling , " said Mr. Trippi of the television blitz . But the stakes justify the effort by both sides , he added . " This is it . We ' re the underdogs , but we can win . And if we win , we ' ll have to eke it out. " // Richard C.

He estimated that the Reagan television budget for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan campaign officials said this figure " sounded too high " for their investment , but they declined to give a precise figure. // Officials agreed that the two campaigns will advertise at an equal pace over the next nine days , having purchased enough air time to assure that almost every viewer in California will be exposed to several Mondale and Reagan commercials. // For Mr. Mondale , the climb within striking distance has been so difficult as to make the slide over the past two days doubly wrenching . At Labor Day , Mr. Reagan was ahead by over 25 points in Mr. Mondale ' s own polls . The Democrat clawed his way to a 12 point deficit at the time of the first debate on Oct. 7 , but the Reagan support was " rock hard " and some Mondale strategists were ready to write off California. // Then , with the President ' s shaky performance at the debate , about one- fourth of his California support went " soft .

But they differ sharply on what has happened since the second debate last Sunday . <> <> Two Different Scenarios // Richard Wirthlin , the President ' s poll taker , says that Mr. Reagan has rebounded to a 17 point lead. // Mondale officials said their polls put the Reagan lead down to eight points with about 10 percent undecided before Mr. Reagan ' s rebound started at midweek , apparently as a result of his improved performance in the second debate. // There is also dispute about the impact of Mr. Reagan ' s political history on this election . As a two-term Governor of California and as a Presidential candidate in 1976 and 1980 , he has carried the state every time his name was on the ballot. // But many Californians moved here from other states , as did Mr. Reagan , and this has watered down home state pride as a political factor. // So Gov . George Deukmejian , the co- chairman of the Reagan campaign , is warning Republicans not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats , he warned , " trail in the polls by a much smaller margin in Caliornia than they do elsewhere . They want to embarrass our President in his home state. " // Current plans call for Mr. Mondale to arrive in California on Nov. 4 and to hold rallies on Nov. 5 , the last day of campaigning , in Los Angeles and possibly in other California cities . Thereafter , he will campaign eastward toward his home in North Oaks , Minn. // Making a final appearance in California , said a Mondale campaign official , is supposed to send a dramatic message to the state ' s voters that , having given the nation Mr. Reagan , they have the opportunity to retire him . <> <> Battle for Absentee Votes // Mr. Deukmejian won in 1982 by getting over 300 , 000 absentee votes . So far , the Republicans claim to have about 185 , 000 absentee votes ready to go for Mr. Reagan , and the Democrats claim they will sign up about 250 , 000 to 300 , 000 absentee Democrats. // Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voter registration battle that Democratic National Committee officials once touted as their secret weapon against Mr. Reagan. // The Republicans claim to have signed up 738 , 000 new voters in California , 772 , 000 in Texas and 193 , 000 in Florida . The corresponding Democratic figures are 603 , 000 in California and 650 , 000 in Texas. // There are no Democratic figures available for Florida , which Democratic officials say has been written off by the Mondale campaign. // Bob Slagle , the state Democratic chairman in Texas , recently issued a statement denying that Mr. Mondale had also written off Texas . In fact , the Mondale campaign is spending $600 , 000 on voter turnout in the state . But that is only about half the original commitment , and the basic Mondale strategy for Texas is to hope that lightning will strike twice . <> <> Race for Governor // Mark White , the incumbent Governor , was running behind in the polls until a surprisingly heavy turnout of blacks and Hispanics lifted him to an upset victory in 1982 . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a 6 point deficit in the polls , Mr. Slagle said. // But for the moment , the polls are showing the Democratic nominee to be as much as 12 to 20 points down in Texas and more than 20 points behind in Florida. // Some Reagan strategists boast that the Mondale campaign went for a " sucker punch " by spending so much time and money in California . But the evidence suggests that , in fact , Mr. Mondale ' s vigorous campaign there forced the Republicans to spend more of their money and the President ' s time than they expected to in California. // Mr. Mondale will try to keep the pressure on by campaigning there today through Tuesday and by returning just before the election. //
