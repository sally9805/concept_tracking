New computers , a new magazine and a new kind of literacy <P> For years , computers have been ballyhooed as a miraculous wave of the future in elementary education . The miracle never arrived . In the 1970s manufacturers spent millions of dollars to develop computers for use in schools , but most of the systems received dismal grades on teacher report cards .

According to Karen Billings , director of the Microcomputer Resource Center at Columbia University 's Teachers College , the more sophisticated desktop computers with their TV-like screens , moving images and music have at last changed the negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantalized by the possibilities ; the latter are astonished that their children can master such seemingly complex devices .
