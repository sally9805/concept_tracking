That sense of vulnerability produced an unusual flood of public concern for Miss Katz , a music student whose right hand was severed when she was pushed in front of a subway train . Could the hand be reattached ? Would she play the piano again ? What would the young woman make of her life ? // " Follow me , " said Miss Katz the other day , the tails of her lab coat flapping as she darted down the corridor of North Shore University Hospital on Long Island . At the age of 24 , Miss Katz is working as an occupational therapist , helping others along the harrowing road to rehabilitation that she trod for more than two years. // She entered an empty lecture hall and headed to the back of a stage . There , buried in a jungle of cable wires , slide projectors and video screens , was a piano she had scoured hospital grounds to find. // As she often does at lunchtime , when the auditorium is empty , Miss Katz sat by the piano and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory keys now plod ; playing the flute , which Miss Katz had been studying at the city ' s High School of Music and Arts , is virtually impossible . " It ' s really so sad , " she said. // All traces of remorse end with this matter-of-fact admission . The hand , so mangled that doctors considered not trying to save it , was reattached during 16 hours of microsurgery and is now strong enough to arm-wrestle . The teen-age sweetheart who stood by Miss Katz ' s side during her ordeal , David Simon , is today her husband . The aborted plan to pursue a music fellowship at the New England Conservatory of Music led to a degree in occupational therapy from New York University and a career that , Miss Katz says , she finds creative and challenging. // A recent afternoon trying to keep pace with the young woman and interviews with her medical advisers , friends and her patients confirmed that Miss Katz is not just muddling through her new life , but rejoicing in it . Miss Katz does not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she spills out ideas and observations in a fast-flowing river of words. // " I ' m lucky , " she said , " really lucky . " She was eating yogurt with her left hand , a small tribute to the years of therapy that transferred such skills from her right side to her left . " It ' s a question of concentrating not on what you ' ve lost but on what you ' ve been lucky enough to keep , " said Dr. William Shaw , an associate professor at New York University Medical Center and head of plastic surgery at Bellevue Hospital . Dr. Shaw led the surgical team that reattached Miss Katz ' s hand . More recently , the same team attempted to repair the legs of Brigitte Gerney , who was trapped under a fallen crane. // Over two years , for more than an hour a day , five days a week , Miss Katz attended physical and occupational therapy sessions at the Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine of New York University Hospital . She can remember bursting into tears a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working to regain the use of her hand. // " It was traumatic and very frustrating for her , " said Patricia Casler , the occupational therapist who worked with Miss Katz at the institute . " For the first month she couldn ' t move her fingers . Then she could move them but couldn ' t grasp anything . It took about five more months to be able to feed herself , and even then it was with special adaptive equipment. " // Miss Katz was able to stop formal treatment toward the end of 1981 , although the therapy she now administers to others is in itself rehabilitative . In coaching people whose upper bodies have been debilitated by injury or illness , Miss Katz ' s right hand is constantly at work building splints or demonstrating innovative ways to cut a cucumber or tie a shoe. // But being an occupational therapist does more than physical good , according to Miss Katz . The emotional satisfaction of being able to use her experience to encourage others has been as rewarding as it was unanticipated , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what they are going through , " said Miss Katz , in the white room where she and 15 other therapists at North Shore treat patients . " Everybody ' s experience is really different , " she said , " and some people would resent hearing that. " // " At the same time , " she said , recalling the agony of being able to play classical flute one day and then having to concoct elaborate schemes just to blow-dry her hair , " I really understand anger and frustration. " // Not all of Miss Katz ' s 12 patients know about her accident , despite the bandage she wears for protection when she works . She tells the story only to those who she thinks might draw something from it and not those whose trauma has made them too self-involved to learn from others. // Ann Carbonaro , one of Miss Katz ' s hospitalized patients , is suffering from a rare spinal disorder that has left her on her back with little muscle control . She knows all about Miss Katz . " It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like maybe she understands what I ' m going through. " // " One of the most important things patients can see from me is that pain ends , " Miss Katz said . " It might take a really long time and feel like it ' s never going to happen , but they can look at me and see that it does. " // Another patient , Linda Caplan , a 28-year-old who lost the use of her arms after suffering a stroke three years ago , sees Miss Katz as a reminder that she , too , may regain her abilities one day. // " I can ' t pick up a dime now , " Miss Caplan said . " It makes me crazy . But I watch Renee do it and I know that she was even worse off than I am . If she can do it , I should be able to do it better. " // For Miss Katz , there is still music . A skilled soprano in high school , she now sings semiprofessionally. // Sometimes she will emerge from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall and belt out a ballad to the empty seats , or practice scales to warm up for the singing lessons she takes once a week . She performs with a Long Island band that plays at weddings and is polishing up an act that she hopes to take to a Manhattan nightclub. // " Sure it would be nice to play the piano while I sang , " Miss Katz said . " So you get an accompanist instead . A lot of people do . Maybe it ' s even better that way , because then you can focus all your energy on getting better at one specific thing. " // " Unforeseen tragedies are unavoidable , " Dr. Shaw said . " But if you can do what Renee did - dwell on the positive and tap resources you never even knew you had - you can really be O.K. " //
