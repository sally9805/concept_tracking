Mixed results from a plan to aid growers who do n't grow <P> Across America last week , the nation 's farm land had a bizarre new look . In Kansas , large brown patches of stubble-studded earth interrupt shimmering golden carpets of ripening winter wheat . In Nebraska , idle center-pivot sprinklers stand like outsize scarecrows over many once verdant cornfields . In California , more than half of the acreage normally devoted to rice lies uncultivated . The cause of the crop cutback is not drought or disaster but a new federal program that rewards farmers , partly in cash and partly in grain and cotton , for taking large tracts of land out of production . Called payment in kind ( PIK ) , the program aims to invigorate the wilted farm economy by reducing bin-busting surpluses , driving up depressed prices , cutting Government costs for farm subsidies and grain storage , and saving farmers production expenses . Alas , at mid-season the results of the ingenious new program are mixed . <P> PIK prompted farmers to remove from production 82.3 million acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oats and rice , amounting to 36% of all eligible crop land . The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that farmers planted only 60.1 million acres of one major crop , corn , down 27% from last year and the lowest level since 1878 . Even with the acreage reductions , however , the nation 's winter-wheat crop , planted last September and now in the midst of being harvested , is estimated at 1.94 billion bu. , the third best crop ever and down only 8% from last year . Farmers in 13 states will bring in larger wheat crops than last year . The reason : record yields , a predicted average of 40.7 bu. of wheat per acre nationwide , up more than 10% from 1979 . Says Kansas Farm Bureau President John J. Armstrong : " Yields are looking so good out here that we 'll harvest nearly as much winter wheat in Kansas as last year on 1.5 million fewer acres . " <P> As a result , wheat stockpiles are actually expected to grow this year . For every other commodity , however , PIK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The USDA predicts that the unsold carryover of feed grains , mostly corn , may dwindle from 3.4 billion bu. to 2 billion bu. by the end of the year , a reduction of about 40% . Rice stocks are expected to be cut by almost half , from 68.2 million cwt. ( hundredweight ) to 36.3 million cwt . " Without PIK , we would have had a market glut like we 've never seen , " says Agricultural Economist Barry Flinchbaugh of Kansas State University . " It would have been a hell of a mess . " <P> Prices have inched up since PIK was announced last winter , but not necessarily as a result of the program . Corn jumped from $2.36 in January to $3.15 this month , primarily because farmers held so much of their 1982 crop off the market that buyers had to bid up the price to get the available supplies . Cotton prices have risen nearly 10 per lb. this year , mostly because of bad weather . Eventually , however , reduced supply should strengthen prices and put more money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " says Tractor Dealer Bob Kennon of Tifton , Ga . " People are more optimistic about the fall harvest than they 've been in two years . "
