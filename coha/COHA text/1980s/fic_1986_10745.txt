is true that some healthy flesh must be touched , but this is a small sacrifice in view of the advantage to be obtained . " " But war is not surgery , " Mym protested . " It is butchery ! I saw the carnage , today , when  --  " " Anything can be harmful , if it is allowed to proceed uncontrolled . Fire is an excellent example ; it can be man 's greatest enemy or his greatest friend . One simply needs to learn how to manage it . Likewise the process of cutting ; what is butchery in the bad form remains excision in the good form . It is not the agent that is to be condemned , but the abuse , as I said before . " There was an insidious logic here that Mym distrusted . " I would prefer to abolish war entirely . " " You can not , " Satan said . " Nor would you want to , if you truly understood it . " " But you will explain my abilities and motives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I said , it behooves one Incarnation to assist another . You can not abolish war entirely , because it is not a cause ; it is a symptom , the tangible manifestation of a more fundamentalmalady . Only by dealing with that underlying problem can you hope to eliminate war . As it is , all you can do is fan it into greater activity or damp it down , shaping it somewhat to your design . " Mym remembered the extreme difficulty he had had in turning off the battle between Gujarat and Maharastra ; certainly there had seemed to be an imperative to combat that defied common sense . " And what is this underlying problem that I would not want to abolish if I could ? " " It is the nature of man , " Satan said . " Man is not a perfect creature ; were he so , there would be no need of Heaven or Hell , of God or Me . Man is a composite of good and evil , and the whole of his existence as a mortal being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that he can be classified and sent to his appropriate locale in the Afterlife . Naturally his mortal span is rife with tensions and disturbance ; it is good and evil that are tugging him this way and that . When men band together in the larger societies they call nations or kingdoms , those larger units assume the attributes of the individuals of which they are composed . There is a fabric of social tension , a pattern ofp101complex and subtle pressures . Inevitably these mount until they manifest in overt war , the most drastic form of competition . You could not stifle that without stifling the society 's most effective mode of expression . If all such interaction could be truly suppressed , man would never be properly defined , and there would be no point in mortality . So it is not your position , as the Incarnationof War , to prevent war ; instead you want to shape and guide this visible aspect of social stress and use it to reduce social inequities and facilitate the emergence of more effective leadership . You want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequity that it can and should be . " Mym did not trust Satan , but this was a most compelling rationale . " I 'll think about it , " he said grudgingly . " Of course you will , Mars ; that is your office . I am satisfied to have helped clarify it for you . " " To be sure . " The ease with which he spoke reminded Myrn of another question : " How is it that I am not stuttering , now ? " " You are visiting an aspect of My domain , " Satan explained . " This place is not governed by natural laws , but by My laws . I see no need for a person of your status to be afflicted with an impediment of speech ; therefore there is none . " " But I have stuttered all through life , and in Purgatory too ! " Mym protested . " That is the difference between life and Purgatory and My realm , " Satan said . " There is much I can offer you , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange for what ? " " Merely amicable relations , " Satan said blithely . " Bring Rapturehere tomorrow , and I will show her also what is available . She will be delighted . " " She needs no demons for amorous companionship ! " Satan laughed . " Of course not , Mars ! What she craves is nourishingfood  --  without having to travel all the way to Earth for it every day , depriving you of her company . " " You have mortally nourishing food ? " Mym asked , abruptly interested . " Here ? " . For answer , Satan waved a hand . A table appeared , heavily laden with a sumptuous repast.  | " But the food of Purgatory looks and tastes real , " Mym said . " How can we tell whether your food is solid ? " " By eating it , " Satan said . " The truth will become apparent soon enough . " Mym nodded . Satan seemed to have little reason to deceive him on this score . His offerings were attractive . Pleasant surroundings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapture to remain with him . if this were truly for the sake of neighborliness , Mym was amenable . He turned about and made his way back toward the castle . The shrubbery became more normal , and the statuary became stone ; it was like moving from the supernatural to the natural . As he entered the castle , he tried an experiment . " H-h-hhello , " he said to himself . Yes , the stutter was back . In the morning he touched the Sword and willed himself to travel to Luna 's mortal residence , where Rapture was staying . One moment he was standing in the castle ; the next he was at the entrance to the house . It was a trifle unsettling to travel so far so readily , but he liked it well enough . He knocked on the door . Rapture herself opened it , expecting him . She threw herself into his arms . " Oh , it is wonderful here ! " she cried . " I missed you so much ! " Luna stood beyond . Mym caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded knowingly . " It is the way of woman , " she said . " To suffer pleasure and pain together . " " I will bring her back soon , " Mym sang . Then he touched the Sword , and he and Rapture stood in the castle . Rapture disengaged and started for the bedroom , but he restrainedher . " Contrary to appearances , " he sang , " there is sometimes more on a man 's mind than that . I want to show you something . " Perplexed , she accompanied him to the garden . They walked down the path and into the extension of Satan 's realm . " But this was n't here yesterday ! " Rapture exclaimed . " There was a wall , the far end of  --  " " True , " he said . " But this is special . "  | " It must be ! These plants are  --  " She paused . " Did you say something ? " " Not a thing , " he said . " You did ! " she exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you this was special . " " But a moment ago  --  why did you sing , if you have conquered the stutter ? " " I have n't conquered the stutter . This is a gift of this garden . Here I can speak normally , nowhere else . " " Here ? What is this place ? " Satan appeared , with Lila at his side . This time both were clothed . " It is an extension of My domain , " he said grandly . " I thought you would like it . " Rapture turned to Mym . " Who is he ? " " Rapture , meet Satan , " Mym said . " The occidental equivalent of Siva . " " Siva ! " she cried , retreating . " And Satan , meet Rapture of Malachite , my betrothed , " Mym concluded . Satan bowed . " My pleasure , lovely mortal woman . " " But Siva  --  God of Destruction and of  --  " " Of sex , " Satan finished . " Which brings us to Lila , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Me that your betrothed is short of concubines , here in Purgatory , and if you approve , Lila will be happy to serve . " Rapture did a rapid reassessment . Western nations had differentand peculiar standards , but in India the Rajahs and noblemen were expected to have plenty of concubines , who were subservientto the wife . It would be a sorry Rajah who lacked concubines , and his wife would suffer loss of status , too . People would think he was impotent . On the other hand , this was not India , and it was a trifle early for Mym to be needing a regular concubine ; it would be better for Rapture to get gravid with a son first . Thereafter , it was a relief for her husband to have plenty of concubines ; it provided the wife more time to herself . But Rapture was a dependent person , who did n't want to be left to herself too much . " Let 's let that wait a few months , " Rapture decided . " By all means , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; only a faint puff of smoke remained where she had been.  |p104Mym  made no comment , but he was privately relieved . Concubinesstill made him remember his father 's lesson in obedience : they tended to find their heads on spikes when declined . Since Rapture had turned this one down  --  or at least postponed her  --  he did n't have to worry about that this time . Also , he was far from ready to trade Rapture off for other women in his bed ; he loved her and wanted to make the most of her while the emotion remained high . Evidently she felt the same , and that pleased him deeply . Now the table laden with food reappeared . " This is a feast for you , honored Lady , " Satan said grandly . " But I ca n't live on  --  " she protested . " Satan says that you can be sustained on this food , " Mym said . " Just as I can talk here without stuttering . " Slowly , she smiled . " Then I can remain here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell to , and the food was excellent . But privately Mym had a reservation . Satan was doing him favors here , and he did not trust this occidental version of savage Siva not to make some inconvenient claim on him at some later date . But as long as Rapture was happy , he would not interfere . Later , alone again , he pondered further . He knew that Satan was tempting him , offering gifts it was difficult indeed to decline . He distrusted this ; but , when the alternative was to be without Rapture or to have her unhappy , what choice did he have ? So he knew he would not interfere with this offering , but he knew he had to some minor degree compromised himself . How could he ensure that no offering of Satan 's subverted his ability to perform his office ? He wandered the bare halls of the Castle of War , nominally exploring its reaches , but actually exploring his own disquiet . Mym was a prince ; he had received expert training in the administrativeas well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treading on treacherous ground , and he wanted to find some way to improve his position without sacrificing anything he valued . It was not necessary for him to turn down Satan'sp105offerings ; it was only necessary for him to shield himself from subversion by them . If he could do that , Satan would not have the leverage he thought he had . But since Satan could withdraw the benefits of the garden at any time , any overt denial would be costly . Perhaps he should simply inform Satan that he refused to be influenced by any such gifts , so that Satan was wasting his effort . That would be the honest course , and it was important to be honest , because Satan was the Father of Lies . Any lie would be playing into Satan 's hands . But if he told the truth , and Satan still thought the gifts would subvert himMym came to a chamber he had not seen before . He had been following an unfamiliar hall , and it had terminated in a flight of stairs that evidently mounted a turret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mym pushed at it with his hand , but it would not budge . He was sure the chamber beyond was not intended to be barred to the master of the castle ; it had to be sealed against intrusion by the servants or visitors . Why ? He explored the door , tapping it here and there . It was solid . There was a large keyhole  --  but he had no key . He touched the Red Sword . He could hack through the door  --  but he did n't want to do that , for that would be admitting some kind of defeat . Or he could render himself into ghost status , and walk through it  --  but again , that implied defeat . He should be able to obtain access legitimately , without special measures . He touched the Sword again , considering . Then , abruptly , he snapped his fingers . He drew the Sword and willed it to change its form to that of a key . The Sword shimmered and changed . Now a large key was in Mym 's hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had guessed correctly , this should be the right key . The tumblersclicked , and the lock gave way . Victory ! He opened the door and entered the chamber . It contained only a table , and on the table was a book . Mym crossed over and picked up the book . The volume had symbols on the cover and symbols inside . Mym recognized these as Chinese or Japanese , but could not read them . Then , as he watched , the symbols shimmered , as the Sword had ,  |p106and  became words , identifying the book . Its title was Go Rin No Sho . But he still could n't read it . Then the words shimmered and became English : Five Rings  --  A Book . The volume had finally zeroed in on a language he could use . Mym had seen this book before ; he had read it years ago . It was a very well known reference for Kendo , or the Way of the Sword , and was studied by serious martial artists everywhere . It seemed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come here often to review it , for the volume was wellthumbed . He opened it randomly , and read a passage . In strategy make the gaze broad . Learn to see to the sides without shifting the eyeballs . Use this gaze always , whether in battle or in ordinary life . Interesting . Mym had forgotten this  --  or perhaps he had understoodit on another level before . Of course it was literal  --  but it was also figurative . A warrior did not want to give away the focus of his attention by shifting his eyes about ; he needed to take in everything while looking at nothing , to spy the enemy to the side , without seeming to , so that the enemy would not have the advantage of surprise he thought he had . That much was literal . But also in the mind  --  a person should grasp concepts without seeming to and fathom deceptions while focusing on ordinary matters  --  justas he was tyring to do with Satan . He flipped randomly again , and read another passage . Become the enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will gain understanding to prevail over him . Again , that seemed both literal and figurative . If a warrior considered his enemy 's situation , really getting into it , he could more readily fathom that enemy 's likely reactions . That could be a valuabletool for victory . But , in the more subtle interpersonal relations , it was just as useful . Satan was not threatening him physically ; Satan was trying to modify his attitude . If he could just comprehend Satan 's motive , he could judge it and work out an effective counter . Mym closed the book . He was impressed . If two random glances offered this much insight , what would the entire volume provide ? The random passages had not given him answers , butp107had suggested alternate ways of considering the problem . He feltthat his awareness had been broadened already . Mym sat at the table and commenced reading the volume from the beginning . Though he had read it before , this time it was as if he had an entirely new text , because he was absorbing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaping up , and the grim horsemen gathered again at the front of the castle . Rapture shudderedas she saw them in their impressive white , red , black , and brown cloaks , their matching horses stamping their hooves and snorting with eagerness . " Must you associate with those ruffians ? " she asked . " I realize that you have a job to do , exactly as you would have had as a Rajah , but these casteless creatures  --  ! " " I fear I must , " he sang . " I did not choose them , but I did choose to assume the office of War , and they are the handmaidens of war . " She laughed , somewhat hysterically . " Handmaidens ! " " But I will try my best to minimize the conflict I supervise today , " he continued . " War may be inevitable , but it does n't have to be totally destructive , if properly managed . Then those subsidiary Incarnations will not have much benefit from it . " She had to be mollified . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like being here without you . " " Well , you can return to Luna 's house in the mortal realm , " he reminded her . " Or you can go to the garden and have something to eat . "  | " You would have to take me to Luna 's house , and , anyway , she 's busy . She 's nice and always polite , but she is engaged in local politics , and I do n't like to take up her time . But the garden ... " She trailed off . " I 'm sure nothing there can hurt you , " he sang . " I would n't trust Satan unduly , but he is currying my favor and he knows that what pleases you is likely to please me . You could go and talk to Lila , to see whether she is worthwhile . " Rapture brightened . " Yes , I must find out how well she sews and weaves , and whether she dances . " Mym smiled inwardly . What a neat solution to her problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their off hours , supervised by the wife . Sometimes the Kingdoms of modern India had contests between the harems of their ranking nobles to see which produced the finest tapestries , and great honor accrued to the wives who organized the winning shows . It was said that the wives were more interested in the harems than the husbands were , though there was a snide side to that remark . But this exchange reminded him of Satan 's influence on his present existence . Satan was helping to make Rapture happy and Satan could help to make her unhappy . That remained awkward . He had read Five Rings , and it had provided him with much upon which to cogitate . But he had not yet digested it sufficiently to apply it to Satan . The heart of the book , as he now understood it , was the five great rings , which equated on one level to the five elements : Ground , Water , Fire , Wind , and Void . None of these were simple concepts , and complete understanding would require long experienceand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chart for his future understanding . Once he comprehended the full nature of each of the rings , he should possess sufficient understanding of the universe to know his true course . He intended to work on it . He donned his golden cloak , mounted his palomino , and rode out with the others . This time they descended on the border between two so-called Middle-Eastern nations , whose longdragged-outwar had broken out again after the breakdown of a truce . Persia was preparing a massive assault on the entrenchmentsof Babylonia , and the scale was far larger than that ofp110Gujarat and Maharastra had been . There was no single spot that Mym could settle on for effective supervision ; there were thousands of troops deployed along a front hundreds of kilometers long . Last time , he had sought to enter the mind of a general and had made little progress . This time he wanted to act with better effect . He had to gain a proper understanding of what was going on here . Then he could devise some strategy to diminish the wastefulness of it . Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the common troops . " When is Persia 's attack scheduled to be launched ? " Mym inquired of Conquest , whose business it was to know such details . " Not for several hours yet , " the white-caped warrior replied . " That will give us opportunity to plan for the greatest harvest . " " Then I shall make my own investigation during that period , " Mym sang . " See that nothing starts prematurely . " Conquest nodded . War 's word was law to those others , for he was the primary Incarnation here . He rode to the lines of Babylonia first . He saw in a moment that the defenses were formidable . Behind towering masses of barbed wire there were extensive mine fields , and beyond these were concrete abutments and hardened emplacements for machineguns . Any human attack on these fortifications would commenceat the cost of many , many lives . If it broke through , only a small fraction of the attacking troops would survive . Obviously the Persian military command was aware of this . What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be somethingspecial . Mym rode to the other side . None of the mortals saw him or his horse , of course . He rode through the barbed wire without being touched and into the Persian formation . There were only a few armed men at the front ; the majority were in special camps , getting ready for the assault . Who would be best to identify with for the ground-level survey ? Mym pondered momentarily and decided on a random sampling . He would enter the camp , count off heads , and take the tenth soldier he found . He found a large , crude temporary barracks building . He rode through the wall . There were the troops , massed for a preparatory  |p111briefing  . Mym counted heads , identified the tenth , and dismounted . " Be near when I need you , " he directed the horse . Then he strode to the soldier he had identified , stood before him , and backed into the man . In a moment he overlapped him and felt the confusion of double identity . Slowly his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his host . The sensations of the body became his own . He was still himself , but also , gradually , the soldier . He concentrated solely on tuning in , on aligning the sensations of the mortal body with his own , so that his identification clarified . This took some time ; while it occurred , the body was going about its own business , but this was a necessary delay . For one thing , the body used an alien language ; the only way that Mym could understand it was to orient on the meaning as registered by the brain , rather than the actual sounds of it . He made steady progress in this , but the process could not be rushed . The first significant thing he realized was that this body was young . This was no man ; this was a boy of about eleven ! Yet he was definitely a soldier ; he had the military garb and a rifle and he had been drilled in its use . He was now being exhorted to go into battle for the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuring him and the other boys of this command , a great honor to fight for one 's country and a greater honor to die for it in this Holy War . He must go out and destroy the infidel enemy ! A child , Mym thought . They were all children , some younger than this one . All garbed in ill-fitting military uniforms , bearing archaic rifles with limited ammunition , and steeped with the ferver of fanaticism . He thought of the formidable Babylonian emplacements he had viewed . These children would be crucified against those defenses ! He probed in the mind for some comprehension of what lay ahead , but none of that information had been provided . This young boy was very like an occidental cow in the corral , moving with the herd toward the slaughterhouse . Cows were never treated in that barbaric fashion in India , of course . It seemed that Persia , having largely exhausted its experienced adult personnel , was now throwing the lives of its children into the breach . They would die like flies  --  but perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced troops could then exploit . It made sense on one level . It was pointless to throw away seasoned troops on an impossible assault and leave the children to carry the major part of the action . Better to confine the heavy losses to those who were least trained , then use the effective troops where and when they could count . But Mym was sickened by this tactic . What barbarism threw away the hope of its future , its children , in such manner ? But he drew on his own memory to fill in more of the picture . This war had started when Babylonia , perceiving an opportunity to take advantage of its weakened neighbor , had invaded , seeking to add territory and acquire important seaports . Babylonia had acted with complete indifference to international law , grabbing at anything it supposed was n't nailed down . Persia had fought doggedly back with inadequate personnel and resources and turned the tide , driving the invader back out of its territory . Naturallythe losses had been substantial . Had Persia confined itself to conventional recruitment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . So it had reached into its reserves  --  the reserves of its future  --  in order to guarantee that there would be a future for its national identity . Outsiders like Mym might condemn such desperation  --  but what would he have done , as the leader of Gujarat , if his Kingdom had found itself in a similar situation ? Some evils were simply not to be tolerated , and among these was capitulationto brutal conquest . He explored the attitude of the boy and found some justification there . The internecine war , dragging on as it had , had decimated the population of the region . The boy 's family had been ruined by the passage of the troops , both directions ; the crop had been destroyed , the father drafted and killed , the brothers driven away , the mother forced to work at starvation wages in a failing effort to sustain her remaining family , one sister raped and killed at age twelve , and the other simply stabbed by the bayonet of an enemy soldier when she screamed in fear and protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's military service in order to get money for his mother , who was working herself to death ; this removed from her the burden of sustaining him and made it possible for her to buy some additional food and pay rent in a temporary camp forp113refugees . This boy had taken the part of a man during desperate times  --  as had the other boys of this unit . If he died in battle , a death benefit would accrue to his mother ; if he survived , he could continue contributing to her support . He was proud to do this  --  and Mym was forced to echo this pride . Given the situation of this region , the boy had done what he had to do , with honor and courage that would have befitted a man of any age . No , Mym could not condemn that . Neither could he condemn the nation of Persia for using boys of this age ; there was almost nothing else they could be used for , in this place and this time , and using them made it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this boy were discharged at this moment from this service , it would not be a victory for what was right and good ; it would be disaster . Mym found himself both glad and sad that he had chosen to share this young soldier 's experience . How true it was  --  a man had to walk a distance in the shoes of another to understand the other 's situation . Now he understood enough of the local situation ; he could withdraw from this host and return to his own form to supervise the coming battle . But now he knew this boy  --  and he found he could not simply desert him at this stage . He knew that the boy was headed straight for death  --  and not an honorable , hard-fought death . For a slaughter . He had to do something . But what ? This war had been grinding on , with brief intermissions , such as the one that helped eliminate Mym 's predecessor , for years . Its momentum was inexorable , and the damage it had already done was staggering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carnage it had wrought would remain . Mym struggled with this , as the preparation for the onslaught proceeded . Could he remove this boy from the locale , at least saving his life ? But that would cause him to be branded a deserter  --  andhow would the lad fare then ? Looking into the boy 's mind , Mym saw that this was no solution ; the boy had to be allowed to complete his mission in whatever manner he could . Could he manage to get this battle called off ? Not by any action of this boy ; he had chosen the wrong host for that . Now it wasp114too late to phase in to another ; the boy 's unit was being marched directly to the front . The attack would commence within the hour . There was nothing Mym could do  --  yet still he did not leave the boy . He had to find some way ! The unit formed at the top of a small hill . Other units formed to either side . There were thousands of youths in this action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  and what would they have accomplished ? The order to attack was given . Bravely , the boy charged over the brim of the hill and down toward the enemy line . His associatesran beside him , their faces grim , but also charged with the unholy joy of the mission : they were engaging in the Holy War ! They were half-drunk with the glory of this combat as harangued into them by the instructors . Theirs , as the words of another culturehad phrased it , not to reason why , theirs but to do and die . For moments there was nothing from the enemy . Then the big guns fired . Shells detonated in the midst of the charging line . The Babylonians had this section zeroed in , awaiting this very charge . One went off not far from Mym , and he felt the blast of it . He turned his head to look and saw something flying at him . It landed before him  --  a human arm , severed at the shoulder . Now , suddenly , the truth hit home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived or died had no relation to his personal merit . It was random . If a shell landed on him , he was gone ; if it did n't , he was free to keep running . Nobody cared . There was nothing he could do to save himself ; it all depended on the shells . The boy froze . He was a boy ; he had not been hardened to the reality of his own complete impotence . He had thought that somehowthings would turn out all right , if he just did the best he could and obeyed orders . Now he knew that was not true . The realizationparalyzed him . The sounds of the slaughter became loud in the boy 's ears . Not all of the victims of the shells were dead , but many were dying . Scattered anguished exclamations projected from the over-all noise . " My foot  --  it 's hanging by a flap of skin ! " " I ca n't see ! My eyes  --  my eyes are all blood ! " " Where did those intestines come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My friend  --  his shoulder is gone  --  and half his head . " The boys , stunned , simply did not know what to make of the horrendous carnage ;  |p115they  were reacting like sightseers , in these first moments of horror . But very soon they would get down to the serious business of bleeding to death . The charge had been broken , but still the shells came . Mym , with his training in the military arts and his experience as a commander , automatically analyzed the pattern of the detonatingshells . There were five big guns oriented on this region , and they were firing sequentially so that it was possible to judge the approximate locations of the forthcoming blasts . One was due for this spot in a few seconds . Mym extended his will and took over the boy 's paralyzed muscles . He had not realized he could do this ; perhaps he could not , had the boy been operative , but under this immediate pressure , he did . He plunged directly forward , getting as far away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him . The blast of it half lifted him , throwing him forward . In that moment he spied an Incarnation . He knew it was one , because he saw a large spider slide in from some celestially anchoredthread and convert to a middle-aged woman whose eyes were fixed on him . He willed the Sword to still the scene . The action of the battle froze , with boys locked in place in mid-stride , and pieces of boys paused in mid-air . " Mars , whatever are you doing ? " the woman demanded . " Who are you ? " he demanded in return , using his necessary singsong . " I am Lachesis . " " Ah , Lakshmi , Goddess of Fortune , " he agreed . " What ? " He smiled . " There seem to be parallels between your mythologyand ours . I recognize your nature . " " But I am only one aspect of three , " she said , nonplused . She wavered and was replaced by a beautiful young oriental woman , then by an old negroid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , Lakshmi has an aspect for each of Vishnu 's incarnations , to be his consort in each . When she manifests with only two of her four arms , she is the most beautiful of women . "  |p116The  lovely oriental reappeared , intrigued . " Oh ? " Then the original Lachesis reasserted herself . " Stop this nonsense ! I 'm not part of your pantheon ! I am the Incarnation of Fate , whose threads govern the lives of mortals . " " Those lives are ending , " Mym pointed out . " No one can governthem now . " " All human events are arranged by Fate , " Lachesis said firmly . " Like the tide , I will have my way . " The tide . Something connected in Mym 's mind . " W-Water ! " he exclaimed . " What ? " " In the organization of the book , Five Rings , one of the five major strategies is based on water . But we five Incarnations may relate to this framework . War is Fire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , nonplused . " I will debate theology with you some other time . Rightnow I must have an answer . Just what do you think you 're doing here ? " Mym was still a bit bemused by this abrupt encounter with the occidental Fate with the spider web . " I am trying to manage this battle , " he sang . " By using children ? " " One must work with the resources one has , " he sang uncomfortably . " I do n't like this , but it seems to be necessary . " " I have very little concern for what you may consider to be necessary , " Lachesis said severely . He could see that , though she was past her physical prime , she had the underlying structure of a supremely beautiful woman . It would have been interesting to have seen her in her youth . " You are using children in war and , while I recognize that you have certain prerogatives , this use is not something I am prepared to tolerate . " Mym did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this put him on the defensive . " Exactly what business is this of yours , Fate ? " he demanded . " It is my business to handle the Threads of Life , Mars , " she repeated with some asperity . " In my several Aspects , I spin them , I measure them , and I cut them to proper length . When you put them into a suicidal war and kill them off wholesale , you are disrupting the pattern I am setting up . I can not sit idly in my Abode while you shear off those early threads ! "  |p117There  was something about Lachesis that seemed familiar , though he could not identify it . He was sure he had not encounteredher before . He had been bothered the same way about Luna . " But war is my business , and these are soldiers . " " Lives are my business , and these are children ! " " Why did n't you route these young threads elsewhere , then ? " he demanded , still bothered by the feeling that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the making long before I assumed this office . I do n't like it , but I must make the best of it . I see no better way than to complete this battle and try to send the survivors home with honor . " " With honor ! " she exclaimed , outraged . " What honor is there in pointless death ? " " This boy I am studying now is earning his own support and that of his mother in the only way available to him , " Mym sang . " He is serving his nation . There is no other way for him . He must do what he has to do , or worse evil will befall him and his companions . I regret this situation deeply , but if this battle could be made to disappear , it would not bring back this boy 's father or his brothers , or provide food or shelter for him . I am trying to discover how to minimize the ill effect of this battle and this war , but the situation is complex , and simplistic protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simplistic protests ! " she exclaimed furiously . Now , in her wrath , she seemed more than ever familiar . Her fair hair , the bones of her face ... " Uninformed ? ! You ca n't talk to me like that ! I am Fate ! " " I do n't care if you 're Devi herself ! This is my business . " " I do n't have to put up with this , " she said . She shimmered , became the large spider , and disappeared . Mym was about to free the stasis and permit the battle to resume , when Lachesis reappeared . This time she had a woman with her . Mym stared . It was Rapture ! Rapture stared about her , appalled . " The blood ! " she cried . " Where am I ? " " You are on the site of Mars ' business , " Lachesis said . " I thought you 'd like to join him at work . " " She does n't belong here ! " Mym cried.  | " Oh ? " Fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread of her life is subject to my manipulation . I thought it appropriate to allow her to participate in your activity . When this battle of children resumes , she will be among them . " Mym was stricken . Rapture would be killed in short order , and , even if he managed to rescue her from the carnage , her mind would be profoundly affected . " Take her back ! " he cried . " Are you ready to deal , Mars ? " Lachesis demanded sternly . This was coercion , but he was vulnerable to it . " Yes , " he sang grimly . Fate shimmered , changed , and vanished with Rapture . In a moment she reappeared , alone . " I arranged for a similar scene to appear on the television program she was watching , " she said . " Later , she will believe that it was only a bad daydream sponsoredby that program . " Her gaze oriented on him . " Now I expect you to abate this war forthwith , so as to give me opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would prefer to have the children out of it ! " he exclaimed . " But I have n't found any way ! " " Then we shall find a way , " she said . " Right now . " " These children are here because Persia needs them for its war effort , " he said . " I really do n't see the point in war , anyway . " " It is a product of the natural tensions and inequities of society , " he explained . " Without war , there would be no redress for certain wrongs . War is only harmful when it is poorly managed . " " Oh , pooh ! " she snorted . " That sounds like something Satan would say . " That set Mym back . Satan had said it . " Have you any strategy in mind to alleviate this battle or this war ? " " Surely it is the result of some misunderstanding , " she said . " If we can ascertain what that misunderstanding is , and clarify it , the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Babylonia 's misunderstanding about Persia 's ability and will to defend its territory , " Mym sang grimly . She frowned . " Babylonia is a bit out of my regular territory ; but from all I understand , it is no shining example of decency . But then , neither is Persia . It was an awful mess , extricating thep119captive threads of over a hundred western hostages from that country . A pox on both their houses . " " Why are you so eager to save their children , then ? " " I could say that it is because some of those children are mine , holding western beliefs in their secret hearts . That , certainly , is what first alerted me to this problem and brought me here . But once I saw the full horror of it , I knew I had to act to protect all those children ; I do n't care what their beliefs are . They do n't deserve to die in a stupid war fashioned by fanatic adults . I do n't care how complicated it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that he was coming to like this woman 's attitude . He had never had much to do with children , but certainly they represented any nation 's hope for the future . " I agree that the children are not responsible for this war , " he sang . " I would prefer to see those who cause wars have to serve on the front lines . " Lachesis laughed . And suddenly he placed that nagging recognition : he had known someone who laughed like that ! " That would end this war in a hurry , would n't it ! " " Are you from Ireland ? " Mym asked . She glanced at him , surprised . " This Aspect is . Of course , now I serve a wider clientele . Why do you ask ? " " I knew a woman from Ireland , a beautiful and good woman , and your hair , your face  --  I think in youth you must have looked very much like her . " " I have come to distrust coincidence , since assuming this office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your ascension ? " " He helped eliminate the former Mars , if that 's what you mean . But he did n't have any hand in my actual selection . " " Are you sure ? Why were you ready for this office , at the appropriate time ? " " I had been denied my fiancee , owing to an abrupt change of political circumstance , and  --  " He broke off . " Does Satan dabble in politics ? " " Does a fish breathe water ? " She fixed her gaze intently on him . " That woman you knew  --  did she sing ? " Mym spread his hands . " I never heard more beautiful music . She had a little harp  --  " " Orb ! "  | " Orb , " he agreed . " You know her ? " " I am her mother . " Mym was stunned . Now the hair , features , accent , and laugh all came clear  --  like mother , like daughter . But what an amazing coincidence , that he should encounter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you distrust coincidence , " he sang . " Because you arrange much of what to mortals appears to be coincidence . Do others do the same ? " " They should n't , but one does . " " Satan . " " Satan , " she agreed . " I very much think he has been interferingagain . What reason could he have had to want you in this office ? " " Apart from my inexperience that he might take advantage of , I can think of none . " " But you know my daughter . " " I loved your daughter . But circumstances forced our separation , and now I love Rapture . This was no design of mine , or fault in Orb ; it  --  " He shrugged . " It happened . " " And Orb loved you ? " " Yes . But she knew why I had to leave her , and I think by now she has made her own life . She was  --  is a wonderful person . " " Is it possible that Satan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " For what possible reason ? " " Because my daughter loved you . " That sobered him . " Satan  --  has an interest in Orb ? " Lachesis pursed her lips . " Possibly , in his devious fashion . Satan  --  well , he once expressed interest in me , when I was young and attractive . I was said by some to be the most beautiful woman of my generation , and males are attracted to that sort of thing . Orb is not far off that standard and she inherited that phenomenal musical talent from her father 's side of the family . Satan tried to prevent her from getting her harp , and her cousin Luna from  --  " " Luna ! " " My granddaughter . " " Your  --  ! But  --  "  |p121She  smiled . " I bore Luna 's father in my youth , and Orb later . It is complicated . We raised the two girls together , and they were like sisters . Now  --  " " But Luna does not resemble Orb ! Both are beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair  --  " But he knew as he spoke that the two did resemble each other , and that was the undefined thing he had been aware of in Luna . " Luna dyed her hair brown and adopted different ways . That , too , is complicated to explain . At any rate , Luna is slated to balk Satan 's grand design to assume greater power on Earth , and Satan has been laboring mightily to eliminate her . But she is protected by Thanatos , so he must be roundabout . Orb , however , is not so protected , so he may have mischief in mind for her , to put pressure on me and on Luna . And  --  I dislike saying this  --  he may have a certain personal interest in Orb , because it seems he is partial to that type of woman . That might be a ruse , of course . At any rate , if any of this conjecture of mine is true , Satan might resent whatever man Orb took an interest in and act to eliminate that man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a prince killed ? " " Surely so . Satan can arrange evil for any person not protected by another Incarnation . " " It was my brother 's untimely death that caused my separation from Orb , " Mym sang , shaking with shock and anger . " He was to be Rajah : when he died , I had to assume that office . So I was denied Orb and given Rapture , against my will . The circumstances of my love for  --  " " No mystery , " Lachesis said . " Rapture is lovely . " " And you were going to kill her ! " he sang , suddenly enraged at her . " No . It was a bluff to make my point . " " You made it ! I would not allow Rapture to be hurt . " " And Orb  --  if Satan threatened her , now  --  ? " Mym spread his hands . " I did not lose my feeling for her , when I came to love Rapture . I  --  would be vulnerable . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thread . Satan can not interfere directly with it without alerting me , and if I ca n't protect her , the other Incarnations will help me . Satan knows that . Ip122suspect that it was the other way around ; he was trying to use you to hurt her . I was n't watching your thread , and certainly not your brother 's thread . " " And Satan was pretending to be my friend ! " Mym gritted . " He does that . Never trust him ; he always has some devious scheme brewing . " " But  --  once he had taken me away from Orb  --  why would he try to separate me also from Rapture ? " " To make you angry enough to qualify for the office of the Incarnation of War ? " " But why would he want me in that office ? I could not do him much mischief before , but now  --  " Mym considered , and realized that he did n't know how he might harm Satan . " Surely I am , or will be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incarnation . " " One would think so . But of course you were n't supposed to know about his machinations in your life  --  if , indeed , we have conjectured correctly . Only our meeting here has clarified that . " " He had to know I would in time recognize the mother of the woman I once loved ! " She sighed . " Yes , I suppose so . I suspect that we have not yet properly fathomed Satan 's mischief . We must be alert for it . Satan never exerts himself without bad reason . " She smiled briefly . " But we have drifted from the topic . How can we abate this battle or this war ? " " By putting the one who started it on the front line , " Mym sang . " We had agreed on that . " She considered . " I had thought we were joking . But now I wonder . Why not put that man here ? " " Because it would be murder . You do n't approve of that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an execution . If the life of that one guilty man could cause the lives of the remaining children to be spared , I would gladly destroy him . " She grimaced . " Then I leave it in your hands . " She converted to her spider form and vanished . So quickly ! Yet they had come to an agreement , and if she , like many of her sex , lacked the stomach for what was necessary , it made sense to leave it in the hands of one who could handle it.  |p123Mym  withdrew from the boy and mounted his horse , leaving the battle frozen . They galloped across the terrain of Babylonia , seeking the palace of the ruler of the nation . This took time  --  but it did n't matter , for the battle was not operative . Mym located the man and , without ceremony , set a hand on his shoulder . This brought the man into Mym 's magic frame ; he disappeared from the eyes of mortals and was carried through the air , through the walls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlefield , directly in the path of the boy he had inhabited before . Then he released the stasis . The battle resumed . The pieces of bodies completed their flights through the air and socked into the ground . The boy , boosted by the blast behind him , stumbled , caught his balance  --  and spied the gesticulating enemy before him . The boy reacted automatically . He stopped , raised his rifle , sighted , and fired . Whether his bullet scored was doubtful ; good marksmanship was unlikely in such circumstance . But his action alerted the other boys of this region . They stopped , raised their rifles , and fired . Several bullets tore into the man , and he screamed and fell . The boys charged up , saw the man 's face , and exclaimed with amazement . They had seen that face before ; it had been on posters used for hate training . They cried the name . A Persian officer spied the commotion and chanced his hide by coming to investigate . He , too recognized the casualty . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpse and dragged it back up the hill . The body was heavy , but there were many hands ; few were slow to realize that this detail was taking them away from the worst danger . The battle , such as it was , dissolved . Mym watched from his steed , invisibly . He saw them get the body into a bunker . He saw the boy he had occupied identified as the soldier who had killed this horrendous enemy . The boy was an instant hero , given a commendation and sent to the rear to report to higher authorities . He would be safe  --  and neither he nor his mother would suffer further privation . Persia had said , publicly and often , that it would carry on the war until this enemy leader was deposed . Suddenly the man was dead . The stated reason for the war had been eliminated . The attack was called off , and a de facto truce developed.  |p124No  more children would die for a while . Perhaps the war would now be allowed to end , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final judgment might be on his method of stopping this war , but he was satisfied . He had not only accomplished his objective , he had learned another way to make his position effective.  |p125Concerned  by what Fate had told him of Satan 's designs , Mym tried to talk to Rapture about it that night . " I think you would be better off with Luna in the mortal realm , " he sang . " Since you can still readily spend the nights with me , here , the separation is really not that onerous . " " With the cousin of the woman you loved before me ? " she inquired bittersweetly . Ouch ! " Who informed you of that ? " " Lila , of course . " " Lila  --  the creature of Satan . " " She 's an interesting woman . She will make you an excellent concubine . " " I 'm not so sure I want a demoness for a concubine . She surely serves the interests of Satan before mine . " " You do n't like the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was not the type of question Rapture had asked before this . Mym was n't sure he liked the change . " I do n't like the notion of being that close to a creature provided by the Incarnation of Evil . " " Oh , pooh ! " she said . " Lila is n't evil ! She 's an educated woman . "  | " What is she doing in Hell , then ? " " She says it was a bum rap . " " A what ? " " A bum rap . A false charge . A misunderstanding . Before she realized , she was in Hell and could n't get out . So she makes the best of it . " " It still sounds suspicious to me . She 's a demoness . " " Oh , do n't be such a fuddy-duddy ! " " A what ? " " An old-fashioned bore . " " It sounds like reduplicating echoism to me . This occidental slang does not become you , Rapture . Do n't forget you are a princess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . And so is Lila . Oh , the things I am learning from her ! " " Like what , apart from gossip and slang ? " " Like this , " she said , and kissed him in a fashion that made his skin heat . " You 're coming on like a concubine ! " he protested . " I 'm coming on like a woman who is learning what it 's all about . " " A princess does not need to know what it 's all about ! " " But a woman does . Lila is certainly right about that . " " I really think you would be better off with Luna Kaftan . " " Luna is a fine woman , and I like her  --  but now that I know how similar she is to your former love , I prefer to keep my distancefrom her  --  and your distance too . It 's enough trouble adaptingto this new lifestyle without having to worry about what 's going on in your mind . " He found that concern singularly difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was true that his new knowledge of her relation to Orb worked a subtle effect on him . Where was Orb now ? How had she fared , after he had deserted her ? Had the ring enabled her to cope adequately ? She had been a western woman , and he had loved her ; now Rapture was assumingsome western attributes , and he did not find them appealingin her . Perhaps there was justice in her disinclination to remain with Luna.  | " Well , perhaps you could stay with another mortal woman , " he suggested . " Why ? I like it here . The food is good , the grounds are beautiful , and Lila is a fine companion . Soon she is going to take me to visit Hell . " " To visit Hell ! " he exclaimed in singsong , almost choking . " I do n't want you going near that place ! " " You prefer that I sit in the castle all day , sewing handkerchiefs ? " He sighed . It was true that there was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps you could find something to do in the mortal realm to keep you busy . I 'm sure Luna would  --  " " Her , again . She seems much on your mind . " Unfortunately true , after the dialogue with Fate . He had never expected to be thrown into the company of Orb 's close relatives . But because he had known Orb well , he trusted those relatives . And he wanted to get Rapture away from the insidious influence of Satan . " I just feel that Satan means to do you some mischief , and it would devastate me to have that happen . " She softened . " That 's an unprincely thing to say . Why do n't you just order me to do what you wish ? " " Because I love you . " " You know that 's a decadent Western concept . " But she could not suppress her pleasure . " I will seek some mortal employment . " " That pleases me . " Then they made love , and all was good . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America . Conquest , Slaughter , Famine and Pestilence were eager to get to work , but Mym lacked proper enthusiasm . Increasingly he was wondering whether he was the proper man for this office . He had been trained for command and for war , but he took no special joy in it , especially not in pointless bloodshed . He would prefer to abolish war . But there was the conflict of interest , because , if he succeeded , he would lose the office  --  and where would he be then ? Locked into this alien Afterlife , his mortal life completed . What chance at the ultimate relief of nirvanawould he have then ?  |p128He  had learned that new Incarnations had a period of apprenticeshipor trial , after which they could voluntarily give up the offices . Perhaps it would be best for him to do that  --  to step down when that chance came . Would that return him to mortal status ? He suspected so . But what offered then ? Would he have to resume his position as Heir-Prince to Gujarat , displacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Princess of Rajasthan ? That would be horrible ! Suppose he could step into the mortal world in some other capacity ? Become a new person in the occidental world ? That had its appeal . But what would he do ? He was trained to be a prince , and that was not a preferred employment in the west . Also , he was a stutterer . He had made it on singsong well enough , but that was in large part because he had held positions of extreme power , both as Prince and as the Incarnation of War . Others did not laugh at the powerful ; they accommodated their idiosyncrasies . But if he tried to assume an unpowerful positionNo , he would have to make do with the situation he had , try to be the best Mars he could be and , if he succeeded in abolishing war , to retire to whatever the Afterlife offered . This was not a bad existence , really . He could emulate Musashi , author of Five Rings , learning to prevail through humility and hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's strategy very simply and directly , in the section on the Ground : to think honestly ; to train , to learn every art and know the Ways of all professions ; to distinguish between gain and loss , develop intuitivejudgment , perceiving what could not be seen ; to pay attentioneven to trifles , and to do nothing that was of no use ; in sum , to be honest and perceptive and purposeful throughout life . So easy to read and to agree with , but sometimes so hard to honor ! How would Musashi have handled the situation with Rapture ? Mym sighed . As far as he could tell , the great Japanese Samurai had never married or formed any significant relation with a woman . Perhaps he had been most practical of all in that ! They arrived at the site . It was a jungle . Lush tropical growth spread all about . " What 's the situation ? " Mym asked . " Muddled , " Conquest replied . " This is a guerrilla war , festeringfor a number of years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ascension , because the underlying causes hadnot changed . " " Satan had a hand in that , " Mym sang . " He did n't like mypredecessor . " " True . But Satan 's grudges are legion . " here , because " So we do n't really know how things are faring guerrilla warfare is not open and measurable , " MYm said . " We only know that there will be bloodshed , much of it by innocents . " " Yeah ! " Slaughter said raptly . " But there is a strong indication that something of extremesignificance is about to occur at this site , " Conquest said . " That'swhy this action requires our personal supervision . " " I should have known there would be more to it than mereroutine destruction and killing , " Mym sang sourly . " Just whatkind of development is this ? " " We do n't know , " Pestilence said . " But I feel it in my flesh , so it must relate to me . " Mym looked at him . The figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he moved , flies buzzed up . If a man was known by the company he kept , Mym thought , hewould have preferred other company . Again he thought of the Book of the Ground , in Five Rings . Pestilence was like a rotting segment of ground ! But this was an erroneous association , for Musashi did not talk of decay , but ofthe importance of basic organization and proper timing in all things , the groundwork for success , and of ascertaining the reality , so as to have one thing but to know ten thousand things . Knowledge  --  there was a prime key . The warrior who knew allthings did not waste his effort on what was of no use . Information ! That was the first requirement here  --  to perceivethat which could not presently be seen . " I will investigate , " Mym decided . He dismounted and lookedabout . What should he look for ? He did n't want to identify withanother eleven-year-old boy ! Conquest said , " There is a government outpost there , " pointing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . As he camenear , four men emerged . They were rough-looking types , wearingp130unkempt uniforms , carrying sidearms and knives . Mym paced himself to overlap the evident leader and phased in . Again he suffered disorientation , but he was getting the hang of this and soon he was using the soldier 's perceptions . This man was reasonably well fed and healthy , but dirty and dissatisfied . He had little formal education and owed his position of limited leadership to his muscle and general insensitivity to the plight of others . Mym did not like him at all , but stayed with him because it would have been too much of an investment in time and energy to phase in to another body . This overlapping was not pleasant for him , but it seemed to be the best way to get a real feel for the situation . If a person wanted to know how to deal with worms , there was nothing like being a worm for a while ! This squad was on a mission . The host was barely literate in Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could read well . " It 's the farm across the stream , there , " the man said . " We 'll have to watch it ; he 's got dogs . " " We know how to deal with dogs , " the host said , and the others laughed coarsely . They trekked to a small wooden bridge across the river . Two emaciated children were sitting there . They stretched out their thin arms in a gesture of supplication as the party approached . " Candy ? " the little boy begged in Spanish . Mym could understand this language now , because he was tuning into the sense of it as rendered by the host 's brain . " Get out of our way ! " a henchman grunted . He lifted his boot , set it against the boy 's shoulder , and shoved . With a scream the boy tumbled backward into the river . " Death Squad ! " the little girl cried , struggling to her feet . " Bad men ! " She started to run away . " Do n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have her telling anyone we were here . " A henchman strode after the girl and caught her . He hauled her back by one spindly arm . " What do we do with her ? " " Kill her , " the host said . " But she 's just a kid , " the henchman protested . " She 's a witness , " the host clarified . " But we ca n't just  --  " " Where are your guts ? " the host demanded . " We 've got a job  |p131to  do . " He drew his knife . " We do n't want noise . I 'll show you how to make it quiet . " He took hold of the girl 's straggly hair , hauled her head up , and brought the knife to her exposed throat . Mym acted . He exerted his will and paralyzed the man 's arms . The little girl dropped from the slackening grasp and lay on the ground , unmoving . She had fainted . " See ? No noise , " Mym forced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because Mym had to focus the thought withoutlanguage , forcing it through the brain so that it came out in the proper words . " No noise , " the henchman echoed , relieved . " For a minute I thought you were going to kill her ! " Mym eased up on his control . The host found himself in the awkward position of having done a senseless thing by his definition . He had indeed intended to kill the child . Now he had to explain his action . It was easier for him to pretend that things had gone as planned . " Now you know , " he said gruffly and turned and moved on across the bridge . Mym had navigated that crisis . But had he done it by proper planning and decision or by simply muddling through ? He still had a lot to learn of the Way of Strategy ! They proceeded on toward the farm . Mym now knew that this was a killer group that went surreptitiously to murder individuals who opposed the policies of this nation 's government ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thousands or tens of thousandshad been killed in this manner  --  but instead of securing the government 's power , this had generated a backlash that had becomea full-fledged guerrilla revolution . This government was at war with its own people and would have fallen long ago if not generously supported by powerful outside interests . Mym had no sympathy with terrorism , whether practiced by the government or against it . If this was the way this government operated , his sympathies were with the opposition . But it was not his job to dictate the political system of a nation or the manner it maintained its base of power . It was his job to supervise the violence that resulted . Well , perhaps he could redefine his job . He had succeeded in  |p132drastically  changing the configuration of the war between Babyloniaand Persia ; was there a way to eliminate these Death Squads here ? Aside from arranging another elimination of a head of state , he was n't sure how . And when he started practicing assassination himself , how did that differ from what the Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the men were near the farmhouses . The dogs spotted them and charged . A henchman tossed down bits of meat that he removed from a special package . The dogs , poorly trained , paused to snap up the meat  --  and in moments they were writhing on the ground . The bait was poisoned , of course . " He 's supposed to be alone today , " the literate henchman said . " His wife 's off at the big celebration . " Mym was n't able to grasp the exact nature of the celebration ; it was tied in too closely with cultural values that did not align with his own . " We 'll play it safe , anyway , " the host said . " We 'll surround the house . I 'll challenge him from the front ; you be ready to catch him when he tries to sneak out the back . " They deployed accordingly . But as the host came to the front , the figure of a woman appeared in the doorway . The host cursed under his breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wife was home . Now it would be messy , and they would have to kill her too . They would charge extra for that . The woman disappeared inside the house , slamming the door . The host charged , knowing that time was now of the essence . He would have to catch and kill the woman , because his weak-kneed cohorts would n't want to do it . He could n't have her escaping and bearing the report of the identity of the killers ; that would embarrass the employer , who preferred anonymity . He lifted his boot and kicked at the flimsy door . It crashed inward . He stepped over it and into the house . There was the woman , speaking into a telephone . A telephone ! There was another vital detail the intelligence report had overlooked ! If he had known about that , he would have taken time to cut the wires before approaching the house . It was a nuisance , but had to be done . Now it was too late ; she had already made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . The woman screamed and spun away from him . He caught at her , getting hold of her shawl . It came free , and he threw it down and grabbed again , this time catching her blouse . That tore as she fought to escape , exposing her haltered bosom . Evidently she had been less formally garbed and donned her blouse over the halter when she heard activity near the house . The host paused . This was a well-shaped woman ! Of course he had to kill her  --  but it would be a shame to let a form like that go to waste . The henchman would catch the escaping man ; he could spare a few minutes . He got both hands on her and bore her back against the wall . She screamed , so he knocked her in the face . Blood welled at her lips , but the scream cut off . He caught at the halter and yanked . The thing was sturdier than it looked ; instead of coming away it stretched out and down , baring one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was magnified by this sight . He stared at the breast , then reached for it . Mym , bemused at the proceedings , had failed to act in time to abate the host 's violence . Now he exerted himself , fighting to control the sudden lust of the man . But though he had been successfulin saving the girl-child , he was now up against a greater determination . The host had not really wanted to kill the child , but had intended to do it as a necessary thing ; in contrast , he was inflamed by desire to possess this woman before he killed her . Perhaps with more experience , Mym could have assumed control . As it was , he could not . While he tried , the host opened his own clothing and brought his body up against that of the woman . Mym gave up the struggle and withdrew . He had possessed a hundred different and lovely young women in his life as a prince , but had raped none . He refused to share a body engaged in such an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the commencementof the rape . He was angry . He touched his Sword . Suddenly he was solid . He reached out and grasped the thug 's collar and hauled him back . But the man was heavier than Mym , and this pull was not enough . Mym touched his Sword again . If the instrument could makep134him solid , it could make him solider ! He reached out a second time , caught the collar , and made a terrific exertion . The man was lifted back and away , and hurled at the opposite wall . He collapsed to the floor , unconscious . It was as if a giant had thrown him ! Curious despite the situation , Mym turned and struck the wall with his fist . His fist punched right through it . He had indeed become more solid ! Ordinary matter was now of a lesser density , so that his flesh had the relative mass of a sledgehammer , and his force was magnified many times . No wonderthe thug had flown ! The woman was staring right through him . Mym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Then she recovered her wits and scrambled up and away , simultaneously hauling her halter back into place . The thug had been right about one thing ; she was an attractive woman . But now Mym had to attend to the other members of the Death Squad , to prevent them from killing the wealthy farmer . He looked through the house , but saw only the woman , hiding behind the stove . The farmer must already be outside . But when he went outside , he found the three other Squad members waiting . The farmer had not emerged . The woman must have been alone . That intelligence was really fouled up ! Then Mym heard something . It was a kind of scuffling down the drive leading to the house . Something was coming . More killersfrom the government ? He summoned his horse with a thought , and the animal appeared . Mym mounted , and the horse staggered . Oh . That extra mass . He touched the Sword and willed himself back to masslessness . The horse relaxed . They galloped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source and paused , astonished . It was a troop of ghastly people shambling along . Their eyes were staring , their mouths hung open , and drool fell across their chins . Their hair was wild , their clothing haphazard . Their arms and legs moved as if operated by marionette strings , jerking up and forward and slapping down . Each one of them seemed about to collapse , but somehow did not.  |p135These  were not ordinary people ! They were zombies ! What were they doing here , roused from their ground ? From the ground ? There was that theme again ! Mym watched as the zombie troop shuffled along toward the farmhouse . The members of the Death Squad saw them and yelled . The leader staggered out , still woozy from his fall . The zombies continued without pause . This could not be coincidence ! The woman must have summonedthe zombies when she phoned . But that explained only part of the mystery of this occasion . Where had the zombies come from , and how had the woman known about them ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his lovely wife unprotected ? Shots were fired . The zombies proceeded without pause . The Death Squad members fired again , taking better aim  --  but still there was no visible effect . They were baffled . Now the woman appeared in the doorway . She yelled at the zombies and pointed to the Death Squad members . The zombies understood . They pursued the men . Too late , the men realized what they were up against . They tried to scramble away , but the zombies surrounded them . Danglinghands flopped against the men , and slack jaws worked . The attack was inefficient , but it was apparent that the zombies felt no pain , so that nothing the men could do to them had any effect . Each of the men was soon buried under a clumsy mass of bodies , and slobbering mouths labored to bite at living flesh . Mym might have interfered , but found he had no inclination . He knew firsthand the evil of the Death Squad members ; they were not worth saving . Also , he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about as repulsive as creatures of human form could be . He realized now that they were not refugees from a graveyard , for none of their flesh was rotting and there was no earth on them ; rather , they were like almost total idiots . Another horse galloped down from the sky . At first Mym thought it was one of his own companions , but then he realized that the color of the horse did not match those he knew . It was n't any color ; it was pale , though the rider was caped in black . Certainlyit was supernatural , however.  |p136The  horse landed and trotted to him . Now Mym saw the skullfeaturesof Thanatos , the Incarnation of Death . " What are you doing here , Mars ? " Thanatos called . " I think I am supervising a battle , " Mym returned in singsong . " Of precisely what nature , I hardly know . " " Of an illicit nature ! " Thanatos said . " Those are zombies ! " " I had come to that conclusion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good cause . " Thanatos was obviously agitated . " Do you know what a zombie is ? " " An undead , " Mym replied . " We have them in India , too , though I have never seen them fight a battle before . " " A zombie is a living man whose soul has been removed . " " Yes , I suppose so , since life departs with the soul . If the mortalbody does not lie still , it is called a zombie . " " But these bodies have not been killed ! " Thanatos said . " They are not on my schedule . " " They are evidently on mine , " Mym sang . " They are doing a necessary job , summoned in defense of that young woman . " " You may organize a battle as you choose , " Thanatos said , his bone jaw grim . " But you may not impinge on my prerogatives . You may not interfere with the souls of mortals before their deaths . " " I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But if they are what it takes to set matters straight , I 'm amenable . " " If you do not eliminate the zombies , I will ! " Thanatos said angrily . This sounded like a challenge , and Mym was not in the mood to be challenged on his own turf . Evidently Thanatos represented the Ground , but that did not give him leave to interfere with Fire . " Show me how to make a zombie , and perhaps I will know how to eliminate one , " he sang . " Like this ! " Thanatos said , and reached his skeletal hand into Mym 's body . The fingers passed right through his flesh , which was n't surprising while he was insubstantial . But then they caught on something within him and pulled on it , and he was abruptly in mortal agony . Thanatos had grasped his soul and was pulling it from his body !  |p137Mym  reacted involuntarily . He stepped into Thanatos , overlappinghim , and exerted his will to take over the other man 's mind . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanatos . Thanatos immediately let go of Mym 's soul , as now he could only hurt himself . Mym stepped out of the body . They looked at each other . " Incarnations should not quarrel with each other , " Thanatos said after a moment . " Agreed , " Mym sang . He knew he should not have reacted so imperiously and was glad to accept the truce . The Way of the Warrior was a resolute acceptance of death . Here he had Death literally before him and should have accepted Death 's concern . " But if only you can draw out the soul from a living body , how did these zombies come to be ? Certainly I did not create them . " " We had better find out . " " The young woman summoned them ; perhaps she can answer . " They went to the woman , and Thanatos spoke to her . " You must inform us how the zombies came about , " he said . The woman seemed startled , as if she had n't realized that anyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . " Do not look at me , " Thanatos said quickly . She hesitated , then spoke in Spanish . Mym , now disassociated from the thug host , was unable to understand it , but Thanatos did . " I am the Incarnation of Death , " Thanatos replied to her . " But I have not come for you , only to discover the truth about the zombies . " She spoke again , with some force . " The Death Squad thug tried to rape you ? " Thanatos asked . He was speaking in English , yet the woman seemed to hear him in Spanish . Mym wondered how that was accomplished , but knew that matter was not worth pursuing at the moment . The woman spoke again . " So you asked the guerrilla connection to send help , but you did not know the nature of what would come , " Thanatos said , and the woman nodded . " Give me that number that you called , " Thanatos said . She protested ; it was a secret she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanatos said . The woman turned to stare into his face . She quailed , then spoke a number . " Thank you , " Thanatos said . He gestured to Mym , and they went into the house . Thanatos picked up the phone and dialed the number . When the connection was made , Thanatos turned to his fine pale horse . " Mortis , orient on that location , " he said . Then he hung up the phone . They went back outside . The zombies were still working on the thugs , and the woman was watching with a certain horrified pleasure . It was not every woman who got such a chance to see an attempted rape and murder so obnoxiously punished . They mounted their steeds . " To that location , " Thanatos told his horse . The animal took off . Mym 's own mount followed . They gallopedswiftly through the air . Soon they came down in a small jungle clearing and trotted to an isolated cabin . This was the place , all right : a number of zombies shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how to walk without falling and how to follow a road . A truck was parked , hidden under a tree  --  the primary transportation for the zombies . " They drove them to the vicinity of the farm , then pointed them toward it , " Mym said . " That must have been all that was necessary . " " Yes . But my concern is with the crafting of them . " They dismounted and walked to the cabin . It was closed , its windows boarded , so they walked through the wall to enter . A man was inside , using mortar and pestle to work up a white paste . That was all . Thanatos manifested before him . " Look at me , Mortal . " The man looked up  --  and stiffened . He recognized Death . Thanatos questioned him , and Mym picked up the essence ; the man had been seeking a better way to purify cocaine and had stumbled upon a savage variation . This product affected the subjectso deeply that he passed right through a trance state into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived , but his mind was almost entirely gone . Thus , the zombies  --  living people deprived of their souls , pro/ceeding without personal volition , doomed to degenerate shortly from neglect . Hence the connection with the Incarnation of Pestilence ; in days , those bodies would be riddled with disease , the prey of flies and worms . Certainly this related to War , for these zombies were being used to oppose the Death Squads . In fact , the woman 's husband , the man the Squad had come to assassinate , was involved with this project ; when he had gotten news that he was to be hit , naturally he had arranged to test the zombies in action . His brave wife had remained at the house to alert him when the Squad arrived . She had been supposed to phone him and hide in the attic , but the premature break-in of the Squad leader had cut off her escape . The zombies would have wrapped things up anyway , but only Mym 's intercession had spared her from rape and possibly murder before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of the zombies that had brought him here , so perhaps that was not coincidence . Nevertheless , there was no question that it also overlappedthe office of Death , since people were being killed , and in a manner that was supposed to be reserved for Thanatos . They were going to have to work this out . Where did they get the people to de-soul by means of this drug ? From captive government troops . It made perfect sense , to the guerrillas and to Mym , who had just seen how the government operated . But it did n't make sense to Thanatos. " lf mortals learn how to handle souls , there will be no end of mischief , " he declared . " This knowledge must be abolished . " Mym thought of the way the zombies had shuffled into battle and concluded that Thanatos was correct . Killing was bad enough , but de-souling would give unscrupulous people a motive for more of it . They would generate armies of zombies , and no person would be safe . It would transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the killing would be done before the battles ever started . " But how can knowledge be abolished ? " he sang . " We shall have to get help , " Thanatos decided . " Chronos could do it . " Because Chronos controlled time , Mym realized . He could tilt his Hourglass and cause time to freeze , and/No , that would n't work . Both Mars and Thanatos had the ability to freeze scenes  --  but the scenes resumed unchanged later . Chronos would have to run time actually backwards to undo the discovery of the drug . That would complicate the world in other ways . " There must be an easier way , " he sang . " Maybe Gaea  --  " " Yes , Gaea would be best , " Thanatos agreed . " She knows how to do things with least disruption . I will summon her . " He lifted the heavy black watch he carried to his face and spoke into it as if it were a microphone . " Gaea . " Mist coalesced , thickening and forming into ghostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Five Rings , recognized this as the manifestation of Wind  --  or Air . Musashi also called it Tradition . " I was waiting for your call , " the voice of Gaea said , slightly before her appearance was complete . " We have knowledge to eliminate , " Thanatos said . Gaea frowned . " To eliminate ! " she exclaimed . " Since whenhave you become regressive ? Satan thrives on ignorance . " " I shall explain , " Thanatos said . Mym heard something outside . He signaled the others that he would investigate while they clarified the issue and walked through the wall . Military trucks were pulling up . What was this ? More victims for de-souling being brought in ? The Incarnations were taking action none too soon ! " The government ! " the trainer of the zombies cried . The first truck screeched to a stop , and soldiers piled out of the back . " Take them alive ! " an officer called . The trainer and the zombies fought as well as they were able , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming . " Spread out ! " the officer cried . Mym was n't sure whether he was speaking English , or whether Spanish was becomingintelligible now . " Secure all property ! Destroy nothing ! " They were after the secret of making zombies ! They must have traced the zombie-truck back to its source and mounted a mission to capture both the site and its personnel . Mym stepped back into the building . " The government is comingafter the secret ! " he exclaimed in singsong.  | " Too soon ! " Thanatos said . " We have not yet decided on a way to abolish it . " Gaea smiled . " Perhaps we can delay them somewhat , " she said . She stepped to and through the wall . Mym and Thanatos followed . Outside , the government troops were combing through the jungleand the clearing , hundreds strong , poking at the ground with bayonets . Before long the line would intersect the cabin . There did not seem to be any way to stop it . " I think fire is best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers spread , and jags of electricity radiated from them . The jags touched the ground  --  and fire erupted . It spread between the points of its origin , formed a line , and swept toward the troops . The soldiers were quick to realize their peril . " Fire ! " they cried . " They 've torched it ! " " Beat it out ! " the officer cried . " Save that shack ! " But the troops were demoralized by the fire . They retreated from it . Gaea turned about . More current flared from her hands . The cabin burst into flame . " But the man inside ! " Mym sang . Gaea shrugged . " Rescue him , then . " Mym strode through the flames and the wall , feeling neither . The man inside was standing , alarmed . Mym caught him by the arm , then touched the Sword . The two of them flew up , through the roof , and into the sky . The man 's mouth hung open ; he could not believe this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman turned to the man . " Who besides you knows the secret for making the drug ? " she asked . " N-no one ! " the man said , his knees seeming to weaken . A streamer of mist poured from Gaea 's right hand . Snakelike , it slid toward the man 's head , and into it . " No one , " she repeated . The man 's expression changed . " I  --  have forgotten how ! " hesaid . " And you will never remember or rediscover it , " Gaea said . " Now depart , before the troops apprehend you . " " But  --  but the fire- " " Will not touch you , " she finished.  |p142The  man walked , neared the line of fire that enclosed the cabin , and walked through it . He was magically protected  --  for the moment . Soon he was out of sight . The officer had succeeded in restoring some discipline in the troops , and they were now attacking the fire with shovels , beating it out . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material and equipment destroyed by fire and the memory of its process gone , they will not be able to fathom the secret , " Gaea said . She fuzzed , became vapor , and dissipated . Mym exchanged a glance with Thanatos . " It seems our problemhas been solved , " Thanatos said . " I have no further interest in the proceedings . " He made a signal , and his pale horse appeared at his side . " Wait ! " Mym sang . " Your friend Luna  --  did you know that I once loved her cousin ? " Thanatos paused . " I did not know . I have not met her cousin , but I understand she is easy to love . " " Now I love Rapture  --  and I do n't like the influence that Satan is having on her . I want her to be more with Luna , a better influence . But she  --  she fears any contact I might have with Luna , because of her similarity to Orb  --  " Thanatos smiled . " I will deliver Rapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mym grasped his bony hand . " I thank you , Thanatos ! If I can ever repay the favor  --  " " We Incarnations must help each other to oppose Satan , " he said . " When I help you , I help myself , for now you will oppose Satan 's designs on Luna . " " I will certainly do that ! But what is it Satan means to do to Luna ? Lachesis told me that Luna is destined to balk  --  " " She is to cast a decisive vote against Satan 's political power on Earth , some years hence . Satan means to remove her from political office , or in some way circumvent her , so that his will shall govern , and he shall be able to corrupt the mortal realm and gain a majority of souls for himself . This would represent his final victory over God . " " Satan can do that ? Change things about on Earth to suit himself ? Why does n't God stop him ? " " The two made a Covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , therefore he honors it and allows free will among the mortals , wherever it may lead . But Satan , being evil , violates it and seeks always to win more power . " Mym remembered that Gaea had said the same . Still , he found it hard to accept . " But then  --  what is to prevent Satan from winning ? " " The other Incarnations , " Thanatos said . " And the war is now coming to you . Wage it well . " " 1 will try , " Mym sang . " But I remain new in this office and still have much to learn . " " That is why the next battle must be yours . Satan always attacksthe weakest point . " Which made sense , Mym realized . But he had little comfort in the realization . Five Rings recommended attacking the enemy 's strongest points first  --  but had the author ever come up against Satan directly ?  |p144Ra|pture  , having made a genuine effort to find a place for herself in the mortal world , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Indian Culture for the University of Kilvarough . Luna , when asked , had been of considerable help , and Rapture was pleased . She was well qualified for this position , as she spoke both English and the languages of several Indian Kingdoms and was excellently versed in the conventions and artifacts of them . The money she would earn would enable her to pay a nominal rental for her stay at Luna 's house , which gave her a sense of independence that she had never enjoyed before . Thanatos , true to his word , brought her to and from the Castle of War each day . At first she had been leery of the skeletal figure , but acquaintance with Luna had reassured her . " Zane , " Luna had told her  --  that was the name she called Thanatos  --  " is not really the Grim Reaper . He is an ordinary man with a difficult job and a great deal of compassion . " Compassion . It was , in its way , a magic word . A dependent person valued that quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being any more thrilled by the nature of his employmentthan she was with Mym 's . And that employment was a continuing wedge between them .  |p145Ra|pture  did not argue the case or make demands on him , but he could feel the tension in her whenever the subject of his work came up . He learned not to tell her of the details of his day 's work , because that made her uncomfortable , and she grew cold without being conscious of it . Their lovemaking became awkward . Yet what could he do ? He had reservations of his own about his office , but had thrashed it out with himself and concluded that his best course was to stick with it . It was ironic that the same office that had enabled him to rescue himself and Rapture from the heartbreak that had awaited them in the mortal realm was now inexorably separating them . There came a night when Rapture did not appear . It seemed that there was a special late seminar at the University that requiredher presence , so it was easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be late the following morning . She would see him the next evening . This was all clear and sensible  --  but Mym did not like being alone at night . Out of sorts , he walked again in the garden . There was Lila , of course . " I think you are ready for a concubine , " she said . " Give me leave to enter your premises , and I will serve in any manner you desire . " Mym looked at her . She was garbed in a slightly iridescent , slightly luminescent , slightly translucent robe that enhanced a figure he knew was crafted in Hell . Her face was classic in its perfection , and her lustrous hair flowed down across her shoulderslike a midnight river of silk . But he had seen  --  and possessed  --  beautiful women before and he still distrusted the motives of the creatures of Satan . He did not want any of them having access to his Incarnation premises . " You , " he said shortly , again able to speak without stuttering in this region . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence ! " i Lila 's eyes widened innocently . " Why , we talked , and she inquiredabout the ways of Western women , " she protested . " I told her nothing that was not true . " " Such as the relationship between Luna and Orb ? " " They are both good women . " " And you are not . " " And I am not , " she agreed.  | " You told Rapture that you were in Hell on a bum rap . ' I am sure that 's not true . " " She misunderstood . I was speaking of another . I am a demoness . I never had a mortal existence . But for that reason , I lack the modesty of true spirits . I can provide you with the kinkiesttypes of passion that a decent woman would never  --  " Angry , he caught her by the arm , not certain what to do with her . She came readily in close , the musky perfume of her body manifesting . " You may hit me if you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please you . Anything at all ... " He cast her loose . " Nothing about you pleases me ! " he snapped , turned about , and stomped back toward the Castle . " Each lie you tell , " she called dulcetly after him , " brings you closer to Satan , the Father of Lies . " He ignored that gibe . But as he returned to his solitary room and tried to settle down for sleep , the barb returned to haunt him . Five Rings had advised him not to think dishonestly , but he had lied , for Lila 's body , if not her nature , pleased him quite well . And actually her nature , her willingness to be with him and to serve his needs , was also quite tempting . He was not looking for a wife , just a concubine ; why had n't he taken her ? Because of what Lachesis had said about Satan . If Satan had really conspired to deprive Mym first of Orb , and then of Rapture  --  thesecond plot foiled only by Mym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with the Incarnation of Evil . Indeed , Satan had been using his agent Lila to subvert Rapture'smind , putting female-suffrage notions in her head ; he was glad he had gotten her away from Lila . Was he now to be with Lila himself ? Obviously not . Finally he slept  --  and dreamed that Lila had come to his bed , her flesh quivering lusciously . He woke , angry , and found himself alone . And could not get to sleep again . The next action requiring his attention was in Cush , a kingdom in Africa . It seemed that a tribe of Nubians in its northern section were rebelling and that the government was using its troops to combat this uprising . Of course it was more complicated than that , because Mars did not need to supervise every battle personally , any more than  |p147Thanatos  needed to supervise every death personally . It was only when something special was happening that he had to attend . Wars and battles were going on continually in scattered regions of the world ; if they ever all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So what 's the situation , this time ? " he asked Conquest as they rode to the site . " Interesting that you should say this time , ' " the white-cloaked Incarnation replied . " It does seem to involve time , though we are n't sure how . " The subsidiary Incarnations never seemed to have full information ; Mym realized that that was probably one reason they  --  ' ere subsidiary . It would be up to him , again , to ascertain the precise situation and decide what action should be taken . If it really involved time , he would have to consult with Chronos . They came down to Earth and galloped across the hot terrain . The earth was sere and barren ; there had been a bad drought , destroying the crops . What a time to fight a war ! They arrived at the site . The battle was about to begin ; the government troops were converging on a rebel site . There were mounds and trenches around the village , so it was evidently defended . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate , " Mym said . He dismounted and strode across to the village perimeter . He stepped down into the first defensive emplacement he saw and phased in to the man there . The initial confusion was milder and shorter than before ; he was learning how to minimize this , as he gained experience . In just a few minutes he identified reasonablywell with the man and could understand what the man heard in his own language , though it was foreign to Mym himself . This man had been a small farmer , doing not well but adequately , back in the years when the weather was better and the crops grew satisfactorily . Then the government had been taken over by the Communists and American aid had stopped and the drought had come , making it impossible to farm effectively . This man 's farm had not made its quotas and had been expropriated ; rather than serve as a laborer on what he had once owned , he had joined the opposition . Many others had done the same . But the same government that said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crops seemed to have plenty of resources to send troops to harass the common folk who tried to stand up for their rights . The only weapon this man had was a spear , while the soldiers had rifles . He was hungry , while they were well fed . But he knew he was right , while they were wrong , and he had nothing left to lose . His children had starved to death , and his wife had died of dysentery . He had survived only because , as part of the rebellion , he had been a position to capture and pillage a government outpost . He had carried two pounds of grain back to his wife , only to discover that the weeks he had been in the field had been too long , and she was dead . Friends had taken care of the disposition of the body , and for that much he was grateful . He had seen what dysentery did to others  --  the pain , the vomiting , the blood-suffuseddiarrhea . The thought of seeing his wife like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better that he had been spared that . But the troops that were to come at him ! He would glory in their blood ! He hoped to take several with him before he died . He knew that their bullets would make holes in his body , but he also knew that the first shot was seldom immediately fatal . He steeled himself to keep going , no matter what the pain , until he could ram his spearpoint into the eye of the enemy , and into the eye of a second if he could , and a third . Whatever he could manage before he dropped , that would be good enough . He knew that on either side of him his companions in the defense of their common soil were similarly determined . Their last supplies of food had been exhausted the day before , despite fractional rations ; honorabledeath was all that remained . Now the first soldier appeared , a head bobbing near the ground , coming toward him . If only he had a gun , he could put a bullet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew how to work a gun . The bobbing head was joined by another and a third . They were coming rapidly ; now they were almost upon the trench . The man braced himself for his final effort , offering up a prayer for the souls of his dead wife and children and for his own . A stone flew from the right , striking the lead soldier on the shoulder . The hit was a nuisance , no more , but the soldier turned to fire at the source  --  and did n't watch where his feet were going.  |p149As  a result , he stumbled right into the trench , issuing a cry of dismay as he fell . This was so unexpected that the defender did not know what to do . He squatted there , staring at the soldier . The soldier , disheveledbut not hurt , hauled his face out of the dirt and brought his rifle around . Mym acted . He lifted the spear and jammed it in the soldier 's exposed ear , hard . The point broke off , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the soldier gave one hoarse scream and collapsed , blood welling out around the wound . Mym stepped forward and caught the rifle . His experienced eye identified it as of obsolescent design , of such ancient vintage as to suggest the Czarist Empire , but serviceable nonetheless . He whipped it about and fired it at the next soldier coming at the trench , holing his heart . The soldier plunged , dead , into the trench . A third one appeared , and Mym put a bullet up his nose . Then he stood and peered out across the field . More soldiers were coming , but the defensive farmers were giving a decent accountof themselves and causing the soldiers to move with greater caution . " Take their rifles ! " Mym called to the trenches to either side of him , forcing his thought through the brain and mouth of his host . " Get the ammunition from the bodies ! Quickly ! We can hold them off ! " And he shot another soldier , by way of example . " But we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have figured it out ! " Mym responded . " Come singly to my trench , and I will show you . It 's not hard and it 's better than dying ! There may be food  --  rations  --  on some of those bodies ! " Food ! That thought cut through to the deepest need of the hungryfarmers . One scrambled to join Mym , who got out new ammunition , set up his rifle , showed the man the trigger , and gave it to him . " Bring it back here when it 's empty , " he said ; it was too complicated to explain the loading mechanism . In this manner they soon formed a formidable cell of resistance that expanded as more rifles came on-line . The farmers were terribleshots , but the fact that there was return fire caused the soldiersto lose courage , and they began a disorderly retreat . The farmers were winning the day ! Then , abruptly , it happened . The battlefield froze . No one moved . Even the bullets became anchored in air. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle ! How had this come about ? Obviously this was the reason he had been brought here  --  someone else was using a supernatural method to stop the battle . And that party was the enemy , for now he saw a helicopter flying away . It was above the battlefield , evidently too high to be affectedby the stasis . Perhaps it had dropped a time bomb , freezing time . Mym phased out of his host , for he had to be able to move . He was not affected by the stasis , because he was an Incarnation , but his host was . He touched the Sword . " Chr-Chronos , " he said , his stutter back now that he was using his own vocal equipment . Chronos appeared , sailing down from the sky , holding his glowingHourglass aloft . He landed beside MYm . " You have a problem , Mars ? " " When an aspect of death was used without Thanatos ' approval , he objected , " Mym sang . " Now an aspect of time is being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , I must inquire why you choose to interfere in my business . " " I would not interfere , " Chronos said somewhat stiffly . " Iassumed it was your stasis . I have no memory of such violation . " " This is the first time it has happened , " Mym sang . " My memory is of your future , " Chronos reminded him . Oh . " And this has not happened henceforth ? It must be afluke . " " Hardly . The supernatural is not incurred as a fluke . Some mortal has discovered how to interfere with time . " And , indeed , Chronos was angry , now . " Can you discover who has done this and eliminate it ? " Mym asked . " That way , you will have no memory of it because it never happens again . " " That will be an awful chore , " Chronos grumbled . " I can deal with the discoverer of the stasis effect when I identify him , but that 's a needle in a haystack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to its origin ? " " I will have to , though it 's not the bomb I want , but the person behind it  --  and that person will be most carefully hidden . There may be deliberate false leads . They may not have expectedp151Chronos to be tracing it down , but their mundane security provisionswill be devious enough . " Now trucks rumbled up to the battle area . These ones did not freeze ; they parked and disgorged active men . These men advanced on the village defensive positions . " Spot nullification ! " Chronos exclaimed indignantly . " Anotherinfringement ! " Now the strategy of it was clear to Mym . The government , having located a point of stiff resistance , had time-bombed it into stasis , then sent in special troops to nullify the enemy . Already the new troops were passing among the defenders , taking away their weapons , and restoring them to the government troops . It was obvious that when the battle resumed , the advantage would be all with the attackers . " That 's outrageous ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance at all ! " " A minor matter , " Chronos said . " What 's important is their infringement of supernatural prerogatives . " " Oh , forget the prerogatives ! " Mym snapped in song . " It 's a clean device to conclude a battle without bloodshed . If it were n't so unfair , I would hardly be concerned . " " Well , I am not concerned with the fairness ' of anything as appalling as physical combat , " Chronos retorted . " But when mortals start interfering with  --  " " I should think your effort would be better spent arranging for food for the starving , " Mym sang , nettled by this slight on his office . " Without your effort , and that of your cohorts , few would be starving , " Chronos reminded him . " Look at Famine over there , eager to reap his bitter harvest ! " " I 'm trying to reduce his business , " Mym sang . " But there is starvation here because of the drought , not because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chronos said . " We have a problem here . " " True . Mym did n't want to argue with yet another Incarnation . " 1 was caught by surprise by this manifestation of the Void . " " The void ? " Mym smiled , " My predecessor left me a book , Five Rings , that aligns the basic concepts as Ground , Water , Fire , Wind , and the Void . I find myself thinking of them as the Incarnations , with myp152office being the fire of War , and yours being the void of eternity  --  no beginning and no end . It is the most difficult concept to grasp . I meant no offense . " Chronos returned the smile . " None taken , Mars . I like that concept . I shall have to look at that book , unless it has ceased to exist . " " Ceased to exist ? " " To you , a book may be published at a certain date , and exists thereafter . To me , that same date represents its cessation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written in 1645 . " " Then it should indeed be available to me for some time yet . When I have leisure , I shall peruse it . " " You are welcome to borrow my copy . " " By the time I get to it , I suspect , I shall have to ask your predecessor . " " I 'm sure he will agree . " Mym considered for a moment . " I think I could do something to locate that man you want , because 1 can phase into minds and learn their thoughts . " Chronos brightened . " Yes , I had forgotten ! If you would do that  --  " " It might take a little time , no pun intended . " " I can give you time , " Chronos said with a smile . " In fact , I could arrange for a shipment of grain to be delivered here , by changing the time frame . " " Then why do n't I try to spot your man , while you see to the grain ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other some good , which is the way it should be . " " The way it should be , " Chronos agreed . " But first  --  " He lifted his Hourglass , and Mym saw the trickle of sand within it change color . The moving men froze , joining the already-frozen ones . There would be no action here until the Incarnations were finished . Mym mounted his steed , and they trotted after the departed helicopter . The horse climbed the air as if it were a mountain ; when they had sufficient elevation , Mym was able to see the flying machine in the distance . " Follow that scientific device , " he told the horse . Werre accelerated , churning up fleeting contrails as he galloped . Mym wondered whether any mortals were watching this  |p153|part  of the sky from below ; what would they think of those cloudlets ? But probably the divots were no more visible than the horse and rider were . Mortals simply could n't see the supernatural , ordinarily . They overhauled the helicopter and entered it . Werre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . Of course it did n't matter ; the horse related only casually to the mortal world . Otherwisehis weight would have caused the helicopter to skew and lose altitude . Mym sat in the pilot 's lap and sank into his body , phasing in . Soon he was reading the thoughts . The man had no knowledge of the nature of the bomb he had dropped ; he thought it was some kind of gas to immobilize the enemy . Where had he picked up the bomb ? From a guarded military truck that had driven onto the military airport and departed forthwith . Dead lead , there . But Mym knew how a military operation worked . There would have had to be clearance for that truck , and the officer in charge of airport security would know about that . So he disengaged from the pilot , remounted Werre , and headed for the airport . As it happened , the security officer was on one of his frequent coffee breaks when Mym found him . That was no problem ; Mym phased in and drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about that truck ? Had the clearance been tight ? Yes , it had been ; that truck had come directly from the New Devices Lab , and all was in order . And what did he really know about that Lab , Mym mused , inserting the thought . Well , not much , but its clearances were of the highest nature . The General in charge of it brooked no interferenceby any other department and was a very bad man to cross . Mym got the name and address of the General and rode there . Ile did n't know how long this would take , and there was a fine green lawn outside the building  --  there might be a drought in the farmlands , but they found plenty of water for the military premises  --  sohe turned Werre loose to graze and used the Sword to move himself inside . The General was watching the battle . He had a closed-circuit television system , with pickups stationed beyond the freeze-zone , and was using his controls to switch from one camera to another.  |p154Even  with telephoto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing seemed to be happening . Mym phased in and tuned in to the General 's thoughts . The man was frustrated . Obviously the bomb was working  --  but why were n't the backup forces moving ? They had nullifiers ! Curse this inadequate equipment ! Mym had no sympathy for the man 's frustration ; he only wanted the source of the technological breakthrough . He shaped a thought and adapted it to the General 's train of thoughts so that it seemed a natural bypath . Could there be some flaw in the system ? What did he know about the designer ? Could the man really be trusted ? If the equipment had some secret liabilityThe General was of a naturally paranoid turn of mind , so this thought took hold readily . He plunged into a review of what he knew about the somewhat oddball genuis who had abruptly come up with the time bomb , when the horrendously financed laboratoriesof nations far , far wealthier than Cush had been unable to make this breakthrough . The time bomb promised to be the key to suppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . But only if it worked perfectly . The individual who had devised it was , ironically , a Nubian himself , a refugee from the drought who had sought whatever employment he could get and turned out to be extraordinarily clever with electronics meshed with magic . No one else really understood what he was doing ; indeed , the device seemed impossible on the face of it . But they had tested it on an isolated peaceful village , and it had worked : the villagers had remained in absolute stasis for six hours , then abruptly resumed activity as the effect wore off . They had been amazed at the sudden jump forward by the sun , not realizing that the world had lived through six hours in the seeming blink of an eye . Then came the companion discovery  --  how to protect men from the stasis . That had worked too . But now they were using both for the first time in the field  --  and something was wrong . The protected troops seemed to have succumbed the same as the unprotected ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted  --  the identity of the scientist who had made the breakthrough . The General had  |p155no  notion of the technology ; all he knew was that the devices worked  --  up to a point . The scientist was the real key . The man was not in the lab today . He had been granted leave to work at home , because that was where he worked best . They had tried to keep him at the lab full time , but that had led to no accomplishments . Because the erratic genius was his , they had to let the man operate in his own fashion . Mym went to the man 's home . It was unpretentious , not even in the better section of the city . The man looked just like an unemployed farmer . He was in patched , baggy clothes and he was asleep on his battered couch . This was the genius scientist ? Mym hesitated . Should he try to phase in to the sleeping man ? Ile had never tried that before . He lay on the man , sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert at positioning himself so that all senses aligned , but still it always took a while to get the complete mind tuned in . The mind was much more than the physical brain , and the brain was no simple mass of tissue ! Each brain had its own idiosyncratic patterns , no two even remotely similar in the cellular detail of the routines , and he simply had to discover the way of each one by guess and error . And this one was different , not in configuration , but because it was asleep . Sleep was a whole new mode . Furthermore , it was dreaming . It was hard enough to adjust to the particular brain and mind , but harder yet to grasp that alternate reality that was the dream state . Some folk presumed that dreams were simply an alternate consciousness , governed by the same rules as those of the waking state , as if the person merely stopped from one room into another . It was not so ! Mym was the man  --  and the man was walking through a section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its branch seeming very large and heavy . Then there was a face , the face of a woman , eclipsing the tree ; in fact the tree was gone , sloughed off without further attention . The woman was the man 's mother . But she was dead  --  and now there was a gravesite , and across it walked a bird of some sort . And now a bowl of rice , but there was not enough ; the bowl was almost empty . Memory of hunger surged up  --  years of hunger . A dog appeared  --  and a stone flung out , catching thep156dog on the rump , and it ran away . Anger ; the animal had escaped . Poor aim ; the stone should have struck its head , knocking it out . Water , a large lake , remembered from long ago , a wonder redoubledin this time of drought . Mym realized that he was seeing the cuttings from an idling consciousness  --  those snippets of information and memory and feeling that bobble about just below the surface of thought , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes breaking through when the critical mind was relaxing . The conscious mind tried to make sense of these almost-random bits , forming them into dreams , but that sense was nonsense , like forming a story from random words , meaning sometimes seeming to manifest , but illusory . He could not afford to drift along with this ; he had to discover how this man had made the time bomb breakthroughs . So he inserted his own thought of the bomb and watched while it had its effect on the melange . The bomb  --  a dream , in this case a dream within a dream , a memory of that . Sleep , and dream of hearing a call and walking toward it and discovering a door in the wall , one that had not been there before . Opening that door , enteringa passage with a glow at the far end . This was working beautifully ; it was a familiar memory , that played itself off when triggered . Walking toward that glow , discovering it to emanate from a book , Success , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could read it as if it were his own , realizing that the pages of this book contained all that a man might need to know about improving his condition . He put his hand to the cover  --  and drew it away , for the cover was burning hot . Indeed , flames surrounded the volume ; it was from them that the glow came . But he knew that there was no other way to read the book , and that if he did not do so now , he might never have another chance . So he nerved himself and touched the cover again , and lifted it , and the flame wrapped about his hand and burned it hideously , destroying it , but now the book was open , and there were the words that would facilitate his destiny of success . And they were the words of the formula for the time bomb . He read them , though he was illiterate , and they burned their impressions on the inner surface of his skull , never to be forgotten . He retreated and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream faded out , and his hand was whole again , but the seared image in his skull remained . Mym pondered , slightly shaken by the intensity of this borrowedexperience . He was not illiterate ; that was the farmer . But what was the true source of the information ? The farmer could not have developed it from his own subconscious ; the technical information was far too sophisticated . But the formula for the time bomb was only part of it . What of the spot nullifier ? Mym nudged the sleeper toward that , and the remembered dream returned . It was similar to the first . The call came in the dream within a dream , and the door in the wall appeared . He entered and walked down the sinister passage  --  and his right hand became a charred mass , its malady restored . He came to the dread hook , Success , the alien word intelligible even to the illiterate , fire reaching up from it . The right hand was useless ; he had to use the left to lift the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into charcoal . But the words were there , different words , and the fire of their formulation reached in through his eyeballs and singed their imprints on the interior of his skull . Now he possessed the nullifier , and the magic was complete . He backed away and emerged again , and once more his hands were restored , and he was awake , with the letters of fire against his pulsing brain . All he had to do was repeat those twin formulas to those who could interpret and apply them , and success was his . Mym knew that the man had done so . He now had the excellent life he had desired . Yet now that he had it , it seemed somehow inadequate . He could not tell anyone beyond the secret project of his significance , because that would make him a target for enemy agents , so he had to pretend to be no more than a simple farmer who had come into wealth . That was unsatisfying . He desired acclaim . He wanted beautiful women to seek him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state to consult him , to take him seriously , and to compliment him on his knowledge . Mym recognized the problem . The farmer had been bitten by the worm of desire for fame and could not be satisfied with only  |p158|part  of it . He was driven to seek more than he had , more than success . Perhaps stirred by Mym 's realization , the dreamer entered a new phase . The dream within a dream formed . " I would n't do that , " Mym said in the dream . But the dreamer shrugged him off . The worm of ambition was too strong ; its poison had spread too far . It could not be denied . Mym withdrew himself from the dreamer . He watched as the man made walking motions with his legs , and door-opening motionswith his hands . Then more walking  --  and the two hands curled up as if de-nerved , becoming useless claws . There was a pause , and Mym realized why ; the man was trying to figure out how to open the magic volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , one leg stirred ; he was lifting the cover with a toe . Mym did not stay . He could see the progression : each additionalpiece of information would cost a part of the body . After both feet were gone , the man would have to open the book with his teeth , and his head would be incinerated . That would be the end of him ; his mundane body might seem unchanged , but his mind would be dead . Mym summoned Werre , mounted , and returned to the site of the battle . Chronos was there , waiting for him . " I thought you were going to go facilitate a shipment of grain ! " Mym sang , half-challengingly . " I did  --  last week , " Chronos replied . " But it has only been a few hours ! " " You forget my nature . " Now Mym remembered Chronos was the Incarnation of Time . Chronos could step into last week and return to the present . " Where is the shipment , then ? " Chronos sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found myself balked by a greater power . " " What power is that ? " Mym asked , alarmed . " Human corruption . " And Chronos explained . He had found the bottleneck , manifested , and by dint of some fast talking gotten the train moving toward its destination  --  only to have it held up at the next station by officials who were determined to collect a decimating tax on its wares . This was a relief train , not taxable ,  |p159but  they affected not to understand that , and unloaded a segment of its cargo . The same thing happened further down the line . At every stop , more was taken , until the train was empty  --  before reaching its destination . Corrupt officials had stolen the entire cargo . Against this , Chronos was powerless ; he could manipulate time , but time was not the problem here . Human greed was . Greed had defeated Time . The grain was now being sold on the black market ; none of it would reach the starving folk for whom it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It should be protectingthe train , not robbing it ! " " When the train is destined for a segment of the country that is in rebellion against that government ? " Chronos asked . There , of course , was the underlying reason . The government would not permit a rebellious province to be fed , for that could strengthen the rebellion . So it permitted the graft while protesting innocence . Mym clenched his fist . " There is justification in war ! " he sang . " To abolish governments like that ! " " Perhaps so , " Chronos agreed . " It is a thesis you have made to me before . " " I have ? " Mym asked , startled . Chronos smiled . " In future years , your framework . " Then he frowned . " I regret I have not fulfilled my part of the bargain . Therefore if you  --  " " No , you made an honest effort , " Mym sang . He was learning more about the limitations of the Incarnations when meddling in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Were they really worth helping ? " I have discovered the source of the technological breakthroughs on the manipulationof time  --  or part of it . A man had a series of visions or dreams that revealed the key formulas to him . Eliminate that man slightly before he eliminates himself , and there will be no breakthroughs . " " Not a scientist ? " Chronos asked , surprised . " Not a scientist . He dreams of a special chamber in which is a fiery book labeled Success , and it burns him when he takes the information . " Chronos frowned . " All in a vision ? That seems familiar . "  | " Oh ? How ? " Chronos shook his head . " I  --  suspect I should not burden you with my conjecture , as I am drawing on memories in your future . Let me just say that I am not sanguine about this . " Mym shrugged . Chronos ' incidental revelations about the futurehad confused him before ; probably it was indeed best to let this matter drop . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He chewed on his lip as he looked out over it . " Do not be concerned , " Chronos said . " When I eliminate the breakthrough , none of this will have happened . You may supervisethe battle as you choose . " Mym was n't sure quite how that would work , but was willing to find out . " Very well . " He described the location of the key man . Abruptly the battle resumed  --  but not as it had been . This time the defending farmers were getting the best of it , and no time bomb dropped . " You prefer this ? " Chronos inquired . Obviously the man had been at work , traveling back and forth in time . Now reality had changed , at least for this region . The breakthrough had never happened . Mym shook his head . " I think I have had enough of battle for today  --  even if none of it happened . I 'm going home . " " This is the way it often is in my domain , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanity . Who could guess what convolutions Chronos had endured  --  that never happened ? He made a gesture of camaraderie and mounted Werre.  |p161Ra|pture  was away increasingly as time passed . She was very positive about her mortal job and seemed to be doing well , but it apparently made considerable demands on her . Mym was glad that she had adjusted so well , but the frequent nights alone botheredhim . Naturally Lila was available . When he could n't sleep , he tookwalks in the garden , and she was always there . Of course she wasready , willing , and able to serve as his concubine , but a complexof considerations prevented him from exercising this option . Forone thing , she was from Hell , and he still distrusted the creatures of Satan on general principle . For another , he was becoming uncertainof Rapture , and that made him less rather than more inclined to use another woman . Had Rapture been solidly establishedand pregnant , it would have been virtually his duty to use a concubine , so as not to place demands on the bearer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature . His seed needed to besaved for the Heir , rather than expended frivolously . So to use a concubine at this stage might be to suggest that he did not desireRapture or seek an Heir , and that was not the case . Also , and this was an insidious consideration , he was not certain that Lilawas a virgin . It was , of course , necessary for a man to know ap162number of women , as no single woman could provide essential variety , but it was important that a woman know only one man . It would demean his princely heritage if he were to consort with an unchaste woman . The creatures of Satan , by all accounts , were of questionable pedigree , and their forms here in the spirit realm were malleable , so Lila well might be a pseudovirgin . His pride kept him from making application to the Purgatory front office for a legitimate concubine , because of the problem with Rapture . Thus he was caught without adequate service in this respect . That was what made Lila so infernally tempting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she inquired dulcetly , appearing ahead of him as he passed the copulating statue . " Maybe you should bring your fiancee back here . " " Where she can be corrupted by your occidental notions of female suffrage ! " Mym snapped . As always , he found pleasure in the ability to speak without stuttering , here . " But Mym , she 's a mortal , " Lila said . " You brought her out of her oriental situation and planted her in the West . Things are different here . Women are supposed to have minds of their own . " " For what ? " he demanded . " Rapture was already well-versed in what she needed to know . " " For pleasing a man and bearing a son , " she agreed . " But what about her own fulfillment ? " She stretched her arms out and up , so that her gown opened in front to reveal the perfect globes of her breasts , lifting with her motion . She was very like a statue in contour . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not in this hemisphere , " she said , coincidentally touching one of her own . " It would be grand for a creature like me , but not for a mortal like her . She needs to assert herself , to branch out , to explore her larger potential . " " So speaks a creature of Hell . " " I may be damned , Mym , but I 'm not ignorant . I have learned common sense the hard way . " She bent to adjust her fastenings , in the process exposing one leg up through the plush buttock . " Not as I see it ! " he said , and strode out of the garden . But alone in bed , he did curse himself for foolishness . Why should he allow the words of a Hell-slut to bother him ? The opin/ions of women mattered little , and those of a pseudowoman even less . Why had n't he simply used her for her explicit purpose and not listened to her at all ? Discussion , after all , was no necessary part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden and do that now or simply summon Lila here to the castle . He could do anything he wanted with her and banish her without notice . That was the obvious and sensible course . That flesh she had arranged to show him  --  he knew that though she was of the spirit world , that body would feel completely solid and alive . She was , indeed , designed to satisfy the lust of a man . But that would mean a kind of capitulation , and that he could not abide . So he suffered alone . He was Mars , an Incarnation , dedicated to settling the quarrels of mortals efficiently , yet he could not settle his own . When Rapture showed up again , the change was more apparent . She was not satisfied to remain placidly in bed ; she wanted to converse about unrelated things . She was full of detail about the students she was helping to educate and their interest in the quaint customs of the Orient , where science was little practiced . She now had classes at all levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of independence , of being able to make decisions based purely on her own preferences . She was developing a confidence in herself and her individual worth she had never before experienced . She was acquiring an occidental wardrobe , so that she could avoid being taken for an Indian at times when she preferred to be herself . She even wore jeans in public . " What ? " Mym demanded . " Trousers fashioned of denim material , blue in hue , " she explained . " Very convenient and comfortable for  --  " " For laborers ! " he exclaimed in singsong . " Not for princesses ! " " I am no longer a princess , " she reminded him , quite undisturbed by the demotion . " I have seen the occidental women in those abominations ! " he sang . " Their posteriors practically rip open the fabric ! " " Yes , that is one of the appealing aspects , " she agreed . " For every passing male to see ! " he concluded indignantly.  | " They do n't object , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some compliments . " " You are my woman ! " he raged . " Only I should see such detail in you ! " She laughed . " Where do you think you are , Mym ? In archaic India ? In the Western world , the wealth is shared . " " Are you sure you have n't been talking with the demoness ? " " Lila ? No , I have n't seen her since I moved to the mortalrealm . But I have been learning about the real world , Mym . " " I think you had better resign that job and return here . " " I will do no such thing ! " she exclaimed . " I am supremelyhappy with my new life . For the first time , I feel genuinely independentand useful , and I know they need me at the museum . " " I need you here ! " " Oh , pooh ! You have everything you need without me . " " I do not ! I spend too many nights alone . " " Alone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched her . " " Whyever not , Mym ? She 's your concubine . " " I do n't want a concubine , I want you ! " She smiled . " That 's sweet . But no need to go to extremes . When I 'm not here , use the damned concubine . " Mym was shocked , at her language as much as her sentiment . He was n't certain whether she was swearing in the occidental fashion , or referring to the status of a creature of Hell , or both . " Well , let 's get this over with , " Rapture said , and moved her beautiful body against him . Get this over with ? What did that imply ? But he realized that further dialogue might only result in his having to spend another night alone , so he let it pass . The business of Mars became routine . Mym remained somewhatdissatisfied with the details of it and with the passions of the lesser Incarnations he had to associate with , but he was satisfiedthat , to an increasing extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wreak less havoc among the mortals than would have been the case without his supervision . There were indeed causes that deserved promotion and that could achieve it only by violence . War , properly managed , was certainlyp165better than the alternatives of oppression or dispossession . But how much better it would be if the causes of war did not exist ! If mortal man could simply exist in peace and harmony and plenty , requiring no Incarnation to supervise his violence . But the mortal realm was as it was , and human nature was intractable . Therefore the various Incarnations were required , and Mym was satisfied to perform this necessary office . It was not his job that bothered him , but his home life . That proceeded from unsatisfying to disastrous , in a single step . Rapture appeared and dropped it on him . " Mym , I 'm leaving you , " she said abruptly . " W-w-w-what ? " W-w-w-what ? " " I have found a nice mortal man , and I 'm going to move in with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " You 're marrying a mortal ? " " No . I am moving in with him . If it works out , then maybe I 'll marry him , but there are no commitments yet . " " But you are my woman ! " Mym protested . " Not any more , Mym , " she said . " We have grown apart , since you became Mars ; you have your life , and I have found mine . It is best that we recognize this and take proper action now . " " I wo n't let you go ! " he protested . " I love you ! " " What will you do  --  make war on me ? " She smiled compassionately . " Mym , you never loved me ; you loved my body and my complete dependence on you . I loved your appreciation of me . But I do n't love your present position , and if I am to be a sex object , I prefer to be it as an independent agent . So it is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am simply recognizing that fact . I hope this parting of our ways can be amicable , but amicable or not , it is occurring . " If Rapture had been dependent , she was so no more ! Mym was so angry at this betrayal that he could not even speak in singsong . " Well , farewell , " she said , and turned and walked away . Now Mym saw Thanatos in the adjacent chamber , ready to convey Rapture back to the realm of the mortals . She had come only to inform Mym of her decision . Mym tasted blood in his mouth . In his rage he had bitten his  |p166tongue  . Now that blood was triggering a rage of a different nature . He would deal with this " John " of hers ! He grasped the Red Sword and willed himself to the mortal realm . He knew where Rapture worked and where she lived ; from there he should be able to trace this mortal man John . But then he paused . Was he , the Incarnation of War , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? To hurt the one he loved , or had loved , or thought he had loved ? How much of his ideal of peace would he be spreading that way ? And this John  --  surely an innocent young man , for Rapture would not have told a mortal about her relation to an immortal . A man who liked Rapture very well , who probably needed her more than she needed him , and wanted to get to know her as well as he could . Mym reversed his course . No , he had no need and no desire to hurt Rapture or her friend . He would set the example that he wished mortals would follow and accept the inevitable with what grace he could muster . He returned to his castle and walked in the garden , severely out of sorts . It was true that he and Rapture had been growing apart , and her initiative had been valid . But he had discovered the joy of loving and being loved with Orb and rediscovered it with Rapture ; he could no longer countenance being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared . " So she dumped you , " she said . Damn her ! Except that she was already damned . " No thanks to you , demoness , " he said . " She was n't right for you anyway , " Lila said . " Maybe she was when you were playing the Prince-Princess game among the mortals , but not for this situation . You need a woman who understandsabout Incarnations . " " True . I shall look for one . " She smiled , inhaling . She now wore one of her translucent outfitsthat were more maddeningly suggestive than full nudity would have been . " No mortal will do , Mym . You need one who is committed to the Afterlife . " " Thanatos seems to do well enough with a mortal . " " Thanatos has a quite remarkable mortal . There is not another like Luna . " " You err , demoness . There is her cousin Orb . "  |p167Lila  shrugged eloquently . " That 's right . You had an affair with her , did n't you ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " " I 'm not so sure . I loved her before , and she loved me . I could love her again . " Lila paced in front of him , allowing her flesh to quiver provocatively . " You finished that relationship when you deserted her for another woman . " " That was not my choice ! " " Nevertheless , you left her in a rather difficult situation . You see , she was gravid . " " Gravid ? " " With child . It happens to mortals , you know . " " Pregnant ? She could n't have been ! " " Verify it in Fate 's threads , Mym . She was carrying your baby girl and she bore her after you left and gave her up for adoption . That rather finished that aspect of your romance . I doubt very much that she would choose to go through that again . " " But she never said anything to me ! " " She did n't know it when you deserted her . " Mym was stricken . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Afterlife do n't get gravid . With them , it 's all pleasure , no consequence . So why do n't you become sensible and do what you have been longing to do for so long ? " She shimmered , and her clothing dissolved into mist . She opened her arms . " I can be most accommodating , Mym , and I make no demands . " He looked at her . This creature of Hell seemed on the verge of victory at last . Her body was beautiful , but her nature demonic . He trusted her to serve her master , and her master was Satan . He tasted the blood in his mouth again . This time he let the berserker reflex take over . Abruptly he was moving . His great Red Sword was out and whistling . It lopped off her head . The head flew up , its face surprised ; the body remained standing . There was no blood . The Sword whistled back . It lopped off the upper arms and the top of the torso cleanly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck and the tops of the two breasts , also bloodlessly . The nether sections of the breasts resembled two bowls filled precisely level with gray stuffing . Both sections of thatp168bosom were expanding , for Lila had been inhaling at the moment of his attack . Again the Sword passed through , severing the body at the slenderwaist . And again , at the genital region , and at the knees . Five swift cuts , and the body was tumbling in six major segments , which in turn were fragmenting as the separate arms and legs fell skew . In a moment there was simply a collection of items on the ground . " In this manner , too , I am ready to serve you , " the head said . It was lying to the side , where it had bounced and rolled . The truncated neck was up , the face inverted . " I just want to be rid of you ! " Mym gritted . " Then stuff my parts in a trunk and ship it straight to Hell , " the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking at his Sword and finding no blood on the blade . His berserker rage had faded , being replaced by bemusement . He had known that demons differed from people , but had not been quite prepared for this . " Use the base of the statue . " Mym went to the copulating statue and hacked off its figures . The pedestal now manifested as a hollow chamber . He sheathed the Sword and wrestled this up . It was indeed about the configurationof a coffin . He picked up a piece of torso and dumped it in the chest . The piece was like warm wax , firm but slightly soft , the flat cut side no different from the exterior . Obviously Lila had had no digestive apparatus , no circulatory system , and no respiratory system . She was simply a shape formed of pseudoflesh , a body without a person . Yet she had walked and talked and seemed alive . She had sewn mischief with Rapture , and much of what she said made infernal sense . She was not a person , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , was she ? He paused , with the upper and lower sections of a leg . He tried fitting them together . They fused , forming the full leg . " You may put me together again if you wish , " the head said . " One more section , and you will be reaching interesting territory . " Mym dropped the leg into the chest . He picked up the pieces  |p169of  the other leg , and the arms . Then he got to the section of the torso from the waist to the mid-bosom . It was amazing how full and firm those half breasts were , as far as they went . Or you could reassemble just that portion of me you wish to use , " the head suggested . He dumped the half bust in . " I prefer a genuine woman . " " A genuine woman would dump you in favor of a mortal man , " the head retorted . " Here in the Afterlife , you need a woman of the Afterlife . " There was that insidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he cared to accept . He had to try to refute it . " I am not of the Afterlife ; I am a mortal in temporary residence . I need a woman in similar circumstance . " " That , too , can be provided , " the head said . Mym finished dumping the rest of the body in the chest , but hesitated to pick up the head itself . So he talked to it a moment more . " How can such a thing be provided ? " " You could take up with a female Incarnation . The youngest aspect of Fate , called Clotho , is known to be obliging . " Mym visualized the young , pretty Oriental , Clotho . The notion appealed . But then he remembered the far more mature Lachesis , actually the same Incarnation in different form . Surely the minds of Fate were the same , though the body changed . In that sense , she was no better than the demoness . A young and innocent body with an experienced and cynical mind was not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fate surely had associations of her own and would not necessarily be eager to take up with a man like him . " Then there 's  --  but , of course , you would n't be interested in her , " the head remarked . An obvious ploy ! But Mym still was not eager to pick up the talking head , so he accepted the ploy . " Who ? " " She 's a damsel , a princess , locked in a castle of frozen mist , unable to escape because no one cares about her . But , of course , that 's none of your business . " " Who is she ? " " Her name 's Ligeia . But  --  " " Why was she put there ? " " It 's her penalty for the mischief she did in life . "  | " Oh  --  she 's another demoness . " " No . She 's a damned soul . " " There 's a distinction ? " The head laughed . " Certainly there is ! Demons are creatures of Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ether with no living processes , exactly as you see in my flesh here . Souls are the immortal essences of mortal beings ; they share the consciousness , intellects , and feelings of mortals , but no longer have mortal existence . " " Like the staff of the Castle of War , " Mym agreed . " But since they are n't mortals , they are hopelessly committed to the Afterlife and are no better for my purpose than are you demons . " " True . But Ligeia is a special case . She was improperly damned , and if she could only get a fair hearing , she might be reclassified . " " Why ca n't she get a hearing ? " " A fair hearing . There are hearings aplenty in Hell , but they are n't fair . Every time she tries to present her case , they laugh at her . She must be pretty upset by now . I think she 'd really be appreciative if someone with some power were to take up her case . But of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd only go to Heaven , so that would be the end of that . There 's no point in someone like you getting involved with her . " Mym was sure by Lila 's attitude that she wanted him to get involved with Ligeia , so he reacted negatively . " I agree , " he said , and caught up a trailing strand of hair and lifted the head by it and swung it into the chest . " Now how do I ship this to Hell ? " " Simply address it for the destination , " the head said . The words were somewhat muffled , because the face was now down . " To Hell with you ! " Mym said . The chest and its contents exploded . A dense cloud of smoke puffed out . When it dissipated , the chest was gone . The next call for the supervision of Mars was in Ireland . When Mym arrived with his grim entourage , he surveyed the situation in his usual fashion and learned that the Hibernian Army , a **25;14605;TOOLONG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants . They were about to loose a plague that would either kill or greatly debilitate those itp171infected . The HA would not even have to fight ; they would simply take over after the plague had done its grisly work . " Is n't this phenomenal ! " the Incarnation of Pestilence exclaimed . " It has been long since I have had the opportunity to supervise a dread plague ! " " Gene-splicing , " Mym murmured thoughtfully . " I have a feelingGaea will be on this , if I do n't check it with her first . " He put a hold on the action , mounted Werre , and headed for the residence of the Incarnation of Nature . But when they reached the Green Mother 's estate in Purgatory , they encountered an enormous moat that shielded it from intrusion . Mym sought to have Werre simply hurdle it or trot across it , but the palomino shied away . " What is this ? " Mym asked the horse . " There is nothing in the world that you ca n't traverse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was not the world ; it was Purgatory , a region of different rules . This moat might be enchanted to balk equines . He dismounted and stepped to the bank . Immediately a weird sort of fish swam close . No , not a fish ; it had the legs and lower torso of a man . But above the waistline it possessed the fins and gills of a fish , and its mouth was full of teeth . " A manmer , " Mym murmured . He had never seen one in the flesh before , but there was no mistaking the crossbreed . A mermanhad the top section of a man and the tail of a fish ; the manmer was the opposite . While it was possible to get along with mermen and mermaids , and maidmers could be tolerably good company if one 's interest was not in faces , manmers were said to have the worst elements of each species . They were brainlessly vicious , existing only to tear apart victims . Mym made as if to touch the water with his boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray of water and sparks went up . No question , this monster meant business . He pondered , then touched the Sword . " Gaea , " he sang . The woman did not appear . Instead a colorful parrot flew in . " Who seeks ? Who seeks ? " the bird demanded . " Mars seeks Gaea , " Mym replied , annoyed . " Prove it ! Prove it ! " the parrot squawked . " You birdbrain , do n't you see me ? "  | " I see a hundred like you every day , " the parrot replied . " All fakes sent by Satan to pester my mistress . " A hundred like him a day ? Suddenly Mym realized that Satan was up to more mischief , trying to infiltrate his demon minions into Nature 's domain by imitating the Incarnations . No wonder Gaea had instituted defensive measures . " Go tell Gaea and she can verify for herself my validity . " " The Green Mother is busy with her own concerns ; she can not waste her time exposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How can I prove my identity to you , so that you will advise her of my presence ? " " Get in to see her yourself , " the parrot squawked . " Only a true Incarnation can do that . " And it flew away . Mym sighed . Right when he needed to consult with Gaea , Satan had set up an interference pattern . Unfortunate timing . Unfortunate ? No , maybe Satan had planned it that way , to prevent Mym from completing the consultation , so that Gaea would not be alerted , and the plague would not be halted before it ravaged the Protestants . That meant that it was doubly important that he get through . He was really opposing Satan , not Gaea . But the manmer waited with eager teeth . Though Mym knew himself to be invulnerable to mortal attack , he was not at all sure about the present situation . If an immortal were invulnerable to the teeth of the manmer , the demons would be able to get through . Certainly Werre did n't trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spell to prevent the horse from leaping or flying over the moat . Mym did n't care to risk his flesh that way . Well , he could still pass . He drew the Red Sword . " I regret this , Manmer , " he said . " But I 'm going to have to slay you in order to pass . " But still he hesitated . Demons could wield swords , too , andwould certainly be willing . Why had n't they done so ? The more he considered , the less easy he became . Finally hepicked up a loose stone and threw it across the moat . At the far bank , the stone exploded . Something had destroyedit . That something was apt to do the same thing to a man or a demon . Again , it was n't worth risking . Also , he really did n't want  |p173to  slay a creature , the manmer , who was only doing the job it had been assigned . But how was he supposed to pass , if a demon could not ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid test for his identity . He considered , and decided that he would have to do some perhaps unpleasant research . He got down beside the water and , when the manmer snapped at him , he put one discorporate hand into the creature itself . Startled , the fishman paused in place , and Mym dropped the rest of his body onto it and into it . His arms aligned with the fins , his head with its head , his legs with its legs . Ile had phased in , physically . Ile adjusted his brain , getting it aligned with the brain of the monster . He had become accomplished at this maneuver , but this was a special challenge , for this was the brain of a fish . Only the most primitive aspects of his brain could align properly ; there simply was no higher center in the fish 's head to match his own . Fortunately very little identification was required . The instructions for the manmer were uppermost in its limited mind , and Mym assimilated them before he got fairly into the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottom of the moat . When the water turned cloudy , that grating became permeable ; it was possible to swim through it . Of course Cutefoot would consume any person or creature who tried  --  except for the one who addressed him by his name . That one , and that one only , he would suffer to pass . That sufficed . Mym withdrew from the manmer and splashed through the water , back to shore . It took the manmer a moment to realize that someone was there ; then he acted . But Mym was already scrambling clear . Werre was waiting for him . " Loyal steed , I must proceed alone from this point , " Mym informed him . " Return to the Castle of War ; I will summon you when my business here is done . " Werre neighed , wheeled about , and galloped away . That was one intelligent steed ; the like hardly existed in the mortal realm . Mym realized that this was a significant part of what he liked about this office  --  the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed into the moat . Yes , deep down he spied the grate ;  |p174the  water was clear , so he could see it . All he had to do was wait until it clouded . There was the sound of hooves . Mym glanced back , and saw a golden palomino approaching , bearing a golden-cloaked rider . That was Mars ! Rather , it was a demon disguised as Mars ; Mym was in a position to know that it was not the genuine Incarnation . He had better get past this moat before the demon arrived . But the water remained clear . He could not afford to enter it yet . He could stop the manmer by speaking his name , but would not be able to pass the grate . He had to wait . Another figure galloped up , just like the first . The parrot had been correct : there were demons all over . No wonder the Green Mother had gotten fed up with it . He had to move on through , before a crowd of them gathered and made that impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demon arrived . " Ho , miscreant ! " it cried challengingly . " Dare you assume my image ? Begone , imposter ! " The sheer audacity of this challenge put Mym into an instant rage . Suddenly the Red Sword was in his hand and whistling through the air . The demon-horse 's head flew off , then a segment of its neck , then the top half of the rider . As with Lila , there was not blood ; it was as if the sections had been fashioned separately and set together , and now were falling apart again . The demon 's upper body splashed into the moat and sank . The water swirled as the manmer went after the fragment . The vicious teeth slashed out , cutting the demon substance into lesser fragments . The action moved down as the fragments sank ; the manmer meant to consume it all . The muck of the bottom was stirred up , clouding the water . " Ho , miscreant ! " the second demon challenged . Mym looked up . The thing was charging down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming , all identical . Damn them ! Literally ! Mym lifted the Sword  --  and paused . The water of the moat was cloudy . He turned , sheathing the sword . He dived into the water . " Cutefoot ! " he cried just before he splashed . The manmer froze in place , letting him pass . He stroked down to the nether grate and through it , the bars seeming insubstantial . He passed into a submarine cave that extended forward.  |p175There  was no surface here , so he could not take a breath , but he was in no discomfort . He realized that as an Incarnation he could not drown , for he could not be killed . Breathing was now mere reflex and convenience , as was eating . In due course , the cavern surfaced , and he emerged into the garden estate of the Green Mother . It was lovely . Shrubs and trees of every description flourished , and flowers abounded . Squirrels jumped from branch to branch , and a chipmunk nibbled at a nut atop a boulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had business . Mym forged on , following a path that led toward the center of the estate . Soon he came to a narrowing of the way . Rocks rose up on either side , squeezing the path between them . In the center of the narrowest section stood a small lizard . Mym paused . There was something about that little creature . It was not afraid of him , and it eyed him with a disturbing alertness . It was dull red , actually rather pretty , and reminded him ofOf fire . This was not necessarily any lizard ; it could be a salamander . He reached to the side and found a section of an old branch . He heaved this toward the creature . The tiny reptile leaped up to intercept the branch , biting at it . As contact was made , the wood burst into flame . It burned explosively . By the time it struck the ground , it was a mass of charcoaland ash that quickly smoldered into dust . That was a salamander , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than the ground it stood on  --  fire that burned until only ash remained . If he tried to pass that creature , and it bit him , he would burn similarly . Of course he was an Incarnation , he reminded himself , immune to mortal threats . But again he remembered that this was not the mortal realm ; this was Gaea 's garden , where other rules governed . If this creature could prevent a demon from passing , it might as readily prevent an Incarnation too . " But there are no demons here , " he muttered in singsong . A figure appeared behind him . " Ho , miscreant ! " it cried .  | " How the hell did you get here ? " Mym demanded , startled and angry . " I said the same magic word you did , so the fishman let me pass , " the Mars-demon replied . " Now defend yourself , imposter ! " And it charged , sword swinging . Mym ducked . The demon stumbled over his hunched body and tumbled into the salamander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I burn ! " the thing cried . Then the form became a structure of ashes and collapsed . " One demon , returned to Hell , " Mym sang . He felt no regret , knowing that these beings lacked any aspect of humanity , apart from their outer semblance . But how foolish he had been , to utter the manmer 's name in the presence of a demon . Naturally the demon had heard , copied , and gotten through . Well , the demon was gone now . All Mym had to do was figure out how to get by the salamander . " Ho , miscreant ! " What , another demon ? Mym realized belatedly that what one could copy , another could . There could be any number of demons here in the garden , thanks to his carelessness . It was a good thing that the Green Mother had had the foresight to place a second barrier . The demon charged . This time Mym dodged out of the way , squeezing by so that the demon found itself advancing directly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other was ! " So , salamander ! " the demon cried . " I shall deal with you ! " And it swung the blade of the red sword down . Mym waited for the flash of fire  --  but it did n't come . The sharp sword cut the salamander in two . The tail twitched back and forth , while the head coughed out a spurt of fire and expired . The salamanderhad been slain . This shook Mym 's confidence . If a demon could kill one of the defenders of Gaea 's estate , then the demons could get through , and this was no valid separation of intruders . Should he be trying to enter himself , if the Green Mother 's power was so uncertain ? The demon Mars strode on along the path  --  and was struck byp177a bolt of lightning from a hovering little cloud . Nothing was left of the creature except a whiff of sulphurous gas . Mym was reassured . The Green Mother 's defenses were tight after all ! Demons could no more pass this spot than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The salamander was only part of it . A second salamander crept out from behind a rock . Things were hack as they had been . Mym took another stick and poked at the little creature . When it sprang and bit , igniting the stick , Mym reached down with his free hand and grabbed it . He phased himself in to it as well as he could , channeling his identity down through his own arm . He had not realized that Mars could do this until it was done  --  yet he realized that he must have known it in some other aspect of his being , because this would have been a suicidal gesture otherwise . The salamander 's mind was small and vicious , but again it was easy to read , because the operating instructions were uppermost . Its name was Sweetbreath , and it would not attack the one who spoke that name . When smoke clouded the region , a hole would open in the wall . Mym phased out and dropped the salamander , stepping hastily back before it could snap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fetched an armful of slightly damp leaves from the adjacent forest floor . He dumped these on the salamander 's head . Of course the creature fired the leaves . A dense cloud of smoke and steam puffed up , covering the path . Now Mym spoke the name : " Sweetbreath . " The salamander froze in place . Mym stepped into the smoke , deliberately breathing and keeping his eyes open , and verified that he was unaffected . There were certainly compensations to being an Incarnation ! His vision was impaired because of the thickness of the smoke , but there was no personal discomfort . He felt along the wall , but found no opening . Had he misunderstood ? The smoke was beginning to thin . Then he realized that there were two walls here . He lurched across to the other , and passed through it and into the ground . Success after all ! He was in another cave , this time a dry one . He touched the  |p178Sword  , and it emitted a glow that enabled him to proceed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emerged at the other side . A lovely valley opened out before him , with ornate bushes and colorful grasses . From above , the pattern of vegetation resembled a labyrinth , but there were no teeth in it , for it was easy to pass around the bushes . Here , too , it would have been pleasant to remain and relax  --  if he only had time . He strode on through  --  but as he proceeded he discovered that the bushes were getting denser and thornier , closing off the routes around them . He had to pick out an appropriate route , and finally found himself channeled into one , that led to a central glade at the deepest crevice of the valley . Above , on the far side , stood the Green Mother 's fancy tree house , not far away at all . At last ! But in the glade was a single item of standing deadwood , a petrified tree , and on a branch of that tree perched a harpy . He would have recognized her by the smell alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to phase in to her and learn the correct way past . " Ho , miscreant ! " Another demon ! " How did you get through ? " Mym demanded , frustrated by this pursuit by his likenesses . " I masked myself as a piece of stone and watched what you did , " the demon said . It was evident that these creatures lacked the subtlety of their master . It did n't occur to them not to answer a direct question . " Then I did likewise . Now I shall watch you again . " " Oh , no , you sha n't ! " Mym returned , drawing the Sword . The demon showed no fear . It drew its own sword , which looked identical , and met him at the edge of the glade . The two blades touched  --  and the demon 's was cut in half . It was no more than normal demon substance , having no super-hardness . But how , then , had the other demon slain the salamander ? There had to be more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , striking with the remaining part of the sword . Mym dodged and ran his own point through the other 's torso . The blade slid through and emerged on the other side , but the demon did not stop ; it walked on up the Sword and struck again at Mym.  |p179There  was a clang as the demon 's weapon stuck Mym 's cloak and rebounded . Mym felt the impact ; that sword certainly did have substance ! - He twisted his own weapon about and lifted it in an upward sweep . It cut the demon in half , from the belly up through the head , but the creature did not fall . Mym brought his blade down and chopped from the side , and half of the upper torso of the demon , including its left arm , fell off , cleanly severed along horizontaland vertical lines . But the right side continued to fight . Mym increased his effort and hacked the demon to pieces . Now at last it was finished . This business of fighting demons was strange . They seemed to feel little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they talked and fought freely while intact . What motivated them ? They could seem most human at times , yet most alien at other times . He turned again to the harpy , who had watched this without reaction . He was sure he could deal with her  --  but how could he he sure that more demons were n't watching ? If they could mask themselves as stones or other items , they could be all around . It would be better to wait a bit before making his move . " How are you ? " he asked the harpy . Now she reacted . " Unsssex me here ! " she exclaimed , spitting at him . " I gather you are not very sociable , " he said with a smile . He had hardly expected otherwise . " I have given sssuck ! " she screeched indignantly . Mym still saw no other demons , so he proceeded . He picked up one of the destroyed demon 's arms and tossed it to her . The harpy caught it with one claw and tore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demon-substance was being shredded . But while she was partially distracted with that morsel , Mym reached up to touch her wing , channeling his identity quickly through the connection and phasing in with her as well as he was able . She was Lady MacBeth , and when a cloud of dust obscured the region , a hole would open in the ground . That was all ; this was just another variant of the usual device . He disengaged and picked up a larger morsel of demon . He heaved it at the harpy , but it fell low , so that she could not catch  |p180it  . In a fury she flapped her wings so hard that a cloud of dust was stirred up . Now he spoke her name : " Lady MacBeth . " The harpy froze , and Mym walked into the dust and found the hole in the ground . He stepped down into it and found himself in still another cave . This time he did not proceed forward . He turned and waited . Sure enough , a demon followed . Mym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the body , until the pieces lost their animation . Another demon appeared . Mym dispatched that one too . He waited , but no more demons came . This , then , should be the end of them ; as far as he could tell , demons were not bright creatures and acted the moment they saw reason to . Any who were able to follow should have done so by now . He turned and went on down the passage he was in . It brought him to a nether gate . He opened this and found stairs leading up . At the top of the flight he found a green and brown room . " Why , fancy meeting you here , " Gaea said . " The approach was more difficult than I expected , " Mym said , realizing that he had at last entered her domicile . " Those demons are a nuisance , " she said . " Permit me . " She gestured , and a swarm of flies seemed to issue from her hand . They buzzed about Mym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke all about him . " W-w-wwhat ? " he asked , startled . " They are stinging the remaining demons into oblivion , " Gaea explained . Mym was dismayed . " You mean I brought some in with me ? " he sang . " Indeed , " she agreed . " But I have dealt with them now . " " But then your barriers  --  they did n't work ! " Gaea smiled . " They worked , Mars . They showed me which of the thousands of false images was the real Mars . I have no fear of demons here ; I merely dislike being deceived . I would have had no rest at all if I had watched every image ; as it is , I have to watch only you . What brings you here ? " " I am supervising an engagement in which one side means to use gene-splicing to create a virus that infects only the folk of the other side . I thought you would have an interest . "  |p181Gaea  pursed her lips . " Indeed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my attention ! " " Well , I have been encountering so much difficulty with the other Incarnations that I thought  --  " The Green Mother smiled . " I appreciate your consideration , Mars . Certainly I could not have let such a ploy pass . I shall straighten this out for you  --  but in return you must give me an intimate part of yourself . " " I must give you  --  ? " Mym sang indignantly . " I came here to  --  " " Indulge me , Mars , " she said . " Oh , take what you want ! " he sang angrily . He should never have expected gratitude from another Incarnation ! " In due course . " She questioned him closely , then lifted her hand to her face . She leaned forward and touched one eye with her right forefinger , and her left with her left forefinger . Two glistening tears fell to the fingers and clung there in globules . She put the globules into separate little sponges . " Take these to your battle zone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " T-t-two t-t-tears ? " he asked , astonished . " Not ordinary tears , Mars . When these merge , they will form a compound that nullifies what Satan has done in Ireland . Their virus will expire and be beyond recovery . No one will die of this particular plague . " " What Satan has done ? " he sang . " Obviously Satan has been behind all the mischief you have encountered , " she said . " He caused the drafting of children for battle , revealed to another party the secret substance to make zombies , sent a vision to yet another to reveal the technology of the time bomb , and gave the secret of the Protestant plague to another . He has been working you over , Mars . " Mym formed an angry fist , knowing that this was true . Why had n't he seen it before ? That vision in Cush  --  obviously Satanic ! " D-d-d-d-damn him ! " he swore . " Which means you must deal with him directly , " Gaea said . " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shall challenge him now ! " Mym sang . " He will not meet you on a field of your choice , " she warned . " Be careful , Mars ; you can nullify the Incarnation of Evil only  |p182by  properly understanding him . Bide your time ; you will know when your opportunity comes . " Mym knew she was right . " I shall , " he sang . " Now , will I be able to leave here without going through all the challenges again ? " She laughed . " Of course , Mars ! But first  --  " She touched him with one hand . He felt a peculiar wrenching and knew that somethingvital was indeed gone from him . Nature had taken her payment . Then he stepped out of her front doorway , which was an opening in the trunk of the great tree she lived in , and saw the Castle of War just across the open valley . There were no barriers at all . Idsp183If Mym 's nocturnal restlessness had been bad before , it was worse now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had known that she would return . Now he knew she would not . His hope for future satisfaction had been negated . He walked in the garden . There was Lila . " Hello , Mym , " she said in familiar fashion . She wore one of her slinky , form-fitting robes that seemed to reveal more of her than would have been seen if she had been nude . " I chopped you up and sent you back to Hell ! " he protested . " What are you doing here ? " " I am trying to serve your needs , " she said . " You are welcome to chop me up again , if it gives you pleasure . " " I just want to be rid of you ! " " Now do n't be that way , Mym . You know you ca n't manage without an obliging woman , and I am most obliging . You can torture me , and I wo n't be hurt ; you can cut me in pieces , and I can be reassembled . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I hate you ! You are a creature of Evil ! " " Well , then , you can hate me , " she agreed , stroking her own torso suggestively . " Summon me to your bed and revile me freely while you  --  "  | " Get out of here ! " he cried , clenching his fist . " Make me , Mym , " she suggested , striking another seductive pose . He paused . He knew that if he took hold of her , she would twine against him , trying to seduce him . If he cut her up , she would reconstitute , in due course . She was a demoness , not subject to the ordinary limitations of mortals . So he avoided those alternatives and confined himself to words . " How can you intrude here , against my will ? " " Is it against your will , Mym ? " she inquired , taking a step toward him . " Of course it is ! " " Do I not tempt you with my flesh and my willingness ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every lie you tell brings you closer to Hell , Mym . Then you will be mine indeed . " " This is my castle ! You have no right to intrude ! " " This is not your castle , Mym . This is an intermediate ground , where mortals , immortals , and the damned may meet . " " This is the garden annex to the Castle of War ! " " This is an extension of your garden annex . You are no longer on your own turf , Mars . Otherwise you would not be able to speak without stuttering . " That gave him pause . It was true that only in this region could he speak normally , avoiding both singsong and stuttering . That was one of the things that attracted him to it . But such speech was a gift of Satan , and he should not allow himself to be affected by it . This reminded him of another aspect of the region . " Rapture was able to eat , here . How was this possible , if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It extends to overlap the mortal realm , " Lila explained . " The table of viands is actually at one of our mortal locations , topologicallyconvoluted to appear local . " " So she was n't really remaining here ! " he exclaimed . " That depends on your definition of here , ' Mym . Reality is as one perceives it . " " Or so Satan would like to have others believe  --  that lies are reality , because he is the master of lies . "  | " Master of Illusions , " she said , as if clarifying a carelessly employed term . " Once one believes an illusion , it becomes reality . If you were to accept me as a real woman  --  " " I know you are not ! " " But I could make it easy to forget . For example , if I assumed another form  --  " she shimmered and became the likeness of Rapture . " Get out of that form ! " Mym shouted . " Why  --  does n't it appeal to you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could only say , not wanting to give her the satisfaction of inciting his further anger . It was evident that demons did not have human emotions , but only emulatedthem . " Then I shall offer you another form . " She shimmered again and assumed the likeness of Orb . " No ! " Mym cried , half in anguish . The Orb-image shook her lovely head . " You are a challenge to please , Mym . Do you crave slightly less licit delight ? " And she became the likeness of Luna . " I do n't want any likeness ! " Mym said , appalled . " I am sure you have noticed how attractive Thanatos ' woman is , " the Luna-likeness said . The insidious thing was that she also sounded exactly like Luna and had whatever mannerisms he had noted in her . " Now you can have her , without stirring up trouble with another Incarnation . You can relish her most private parts  --  " " How can I be rid of you ? " he demanded . The Lila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think two are most feasible for your situation . One is to retire to your Castle of War , where I can not intrude without your expressinvitation , and live alone , never emerging to this garden . I dare say that would enhance your prowess as Mars , for you would get pretty violent after a while . " She spoke truly . That was one of the things that annoyed him most . Lila always spoke the truth  --  the truth he did not want to hear . " And the other ? " " You could find yourself another woman . Once I see that you are fully satisfied , I will leave you alone , for there will be no hope for me. "  | " Demons have hope ? Is n't that a mortal feeling ? " " A mortal illusion , " she said , again correcting him . " But also an immortal one . There is no mortal hope like that of a damned soul who dreams of eventual release to Heaven . " ' " But you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " True . I spoke figuratively . I exist only to corrupt you , in any form I can . " She wavered again and became Lilith . " You  --  are she ? " Mym asked , appalled again . " The distinction is meaningless , Mym . I am the demoness assigned to torment you into doing my Master 's will . There is no individuality among demons , and form is but a convenience . " " So when Satan sent Lilith away and brought you in her place  --  " " I only exchanged forms , " she agreed . " It does n't matter . " " But she was represented as an ancient succubus , the companionof evil men since time began , while you were represented as a virgin ! " " Representations are but another form of illusion . For you , I would have been a virgin . " " But that was a lie ! I thought you always told the truth ! " " Truth is meaningless to a demon , " she remined him . " It is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a lie , for there can be neither virginity nor nonvirginity in a demoness . She has no mortal flesh . The only distinction is in your perception  --  as is the case with mortals , too . Virginity has always been a figmentof mortal male imagination . " What bothered him most was that she was making sense . Perhapswhat he deserved was a creature like her , who could meet both his physical and intellectual needs , for she was beautiful and intelligent . But that was the nature of Satan 's trap . " Then I will find myself a woman ! " he said , and stomped away . " Find Ligeia , " she called after him . He paused , then turned back . " Why do you advise me like this ? Is n't this to your disadvantage ? " She was Lila again . " Mym , you are an honest man and a good man . I am only a creature of Hell . But while I am with you , I am shaped by your expectations , and I become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I serve . Thus I help you in whatever way you ask . " " But I detest you ! I only want to be rid of you ! "  | " No , You only want to be rid of the demon aspect of me . You deceive yourself when you say otherwise , and because I serve in the way you wish , I become your conscience and correct you on that . Eventually , you will accept me , as you have molded me to he . " Mym shook his head . " Woman , you are dangerous ! " " I am dangerous , " she agreed . " Because once you accept me , I will subvert you , and you will serve Satan , though you deny it . " " And you claim you have no emotion ? " he asked . " You do not care at all for me , you only labor to subvert me ? " " True . " " I think you are lying , Lila . " She averted her gaze , not answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear at one eye . He started to speak , but stopped . He reached out to her , but stopped . Her human emotion  --  this was the true lie ! And it had almost worked . He turned away and hurried on down the garden . The farther reaches of the garden became rougher , as he passed beyond the presentation section . Instead of trimmed hedges , there were unruly bushes , and the animated statues were replaced by irregular pylons of stone . The original pathway deteriorated into a rut , and the flowers that had bounded it now were weeds . Even ( the weather changed , losing its balmy glow and becoming cold and gloomy . Mym realized that he should turn back , for this was no place for a man to be . But his cloak protected him from environmental extremes , so he suffered no physical discomfort and , of course , he did n't have to walk if he did n't want to . He could simply use the Red Sword to travelOr summon his good steed . " Werre ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoofbeats . There was the horse , galloping in from the side . " How glad I am to see you ! " Mym cried , hugging Werre about the neck as the animal drew up . Then he mounted . " Take me to Ligeia , " he said , uncertain whether the horse would be able to respond to such a directive.  |p188Werre  took off , galloping across the wilderness landscape . Evidentlyhe did know where it was . Soon they reached a barren plateau , a kind of snowy tundra , as desolate as Mym 's romantic prospects . Werre galloped across , and ahead there came into view a sparkling palace , as pretty in its symmetry as the plain was dull . But the palace came no nearer , though the horse was moving at a velocity no mortal steed could match . Perplexed , Mym sighted carefully at it and discovered that it was like a mirage , keeping a constant distance from them . " Whoa , Werre , " he said , using the occidental term the horse preferred . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked toward the palace . Now he made progress ; it was closer . He called to the horse , but as Werre approached him , the palace receded . " Now that 's curious , " Mym said . " It is keeping its distance from you , not from me . Well , you have brought me close enough ; I 'll use the Sword to take me in the rest of the way . Return to the castle , Werre , and I will rejoin you later . " Obediently , the horse galloped away . Mym regretted losing him , but if this were the only way to approach this equine-shy domicile , then so be it . He touched the Sword , and in a moment he was standing at the outer wall of the palace . The structure was larger and prettier than it had seemed from a distance . The wall was of glistening ice and towered up some ten meters before giving way to the first embrasure . Mym tried to climb it , but the ice was tractionless and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up , " he murmured . The Sword lifted him up along the wall to the embrasure . But when he got there he discovered it was halfway illusory ; invisibly transparent ice covered it , so that there was no entrance . The turrets were the same ; the ice sealed everything in . This castle was tight , iced all over . He returned to the ground and considered . Though the ice seemed transparent , diffraction increased with depth , so that the interior became opaque . But he was sure this was the right place , because Lila had described it as a castle of frozen mist , and this was that , albeit somewhat more solid than anticipated . Also ,  |p189Werre  had been headed here . He needed to get in , to rescue the damsel in distress . Mym drew the Sword . " I hate to do it , " he murmured to himself . " But I 'll have to cut my way into the beautiful structure . " He braced himself and swung at the wall , knowing that the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaged by none . And almost fell on his face as the blade passed through the wall without resistance . It was mist indeed ! He recovered his balance and touched the ice again . It was absolutely solid . He knocked at it with a knuckle , and it was hard . But then how had the Sword  --  ? He lifted the Sword and poked the point slowly at the wall . It sank in without contact . He moved the blade about , and it swept through the wall without affecting it . What was this ? He set his left hand against the cold wall , then passed the blade slowly down through it until the edge touched his hand . The Sword did not cut him , of course ; the magic of his office protected him from his own weaponry . The edge nudged him and stopped . His hand was firm against the wall , while the Sword felt nothing except his hand . To his hand , the wall was solid ice ; to the Sword , it was mere mist . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered how this palace had been unapproachable by the horse . Now it was untouchable by the Sword . He retreated a few paces , then unstrapped the harness and set the Sword and scabbard on the snow . He had no concern about losing the weapon ; it would come at his beck , and no other person , mortal or immortal , could use it without his leave . It was not physical contact that bound the Sword to him , but the office . He located a hefty stone , picked it up , and carried it to the wall . The stone weighed about four kilograms and had a ragged point at one side ; it would do as a sledgehammer . He smashed the stone into the wall . The ice cracked , sending radiating lines out in all directions . He struck again , and a chip of ice flaked off . Several more blows gouged out a small crater , then a larger one . Continuing effort broke a hole in it . He bashed away at the edges , until he was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p190It  was as lovely inside as out . There were halls and chambers and stairs , all silent and clean . Light emanated from the ceiling , resembling the Northern Lights . Carpets of ice hung on the walls , with snowflake patterns within that formed pictures of snowscapes . He walked along those eerie halls , studying it all . Though this palace was cold and would be horrible for a normal person , he found it pleasant . But why had it been constructed ? Solely to punish an errant soul ? That seemed to be an awful amount of design and effort for a soul that could be made miserable by far simpler means . Yet it did seem to be the case . He found the central chamber . There , on a kind of pedestal , was a box , formed of transparent ice , and in the box was a bed , and in the bed was a lovely young woman , protected by a coverlet of puffy white snow . Something about this situation nagged at Mym 's memory . He paused to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story of the Slumbering Lovely . She had been enchanted to sleep for a century or so , until a prince of a later generation rescued her . Apparently it had been a mechanism for merging two lines of royalty when one was not eligible at the appropriate time . Well , he was , or had been a prince , and the demoness had called this one the Princess Ligeia . It seemed appropriate to rescue her . Certainly she was beautiful , and seemed to be about his own age , though of course there was no telling how long she had been here ; she might be of his grandmother 's generation . Did that matter ? Not really ; not if she had slept unaware for the intervening time , so remained young in outlook . He touched the box , discovering that a dome of ice covered the top , sealing in the Princess . Well , he could break it so as to be able to get to her and  --  how were slumbering lovelies awakened ? By a kiss , as he recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could accommodate that . He tapped on the glassy dome . It rang , but did not break . The girl stirred . Her eyes opened . They were green , like deep ice : She saw him . Her mouth opened , and her bosom heaved so violently that the snow blanket bounced off , but there was no sound . " Do n't worry , " Mym said in English , as he doubted that this  |p191Nordic  woman spoke his native language . " I am about to rescue you . " But she sat up , throwing off the remaining cover , and kneeled on the bed opposite him . She wore a fetching pink nightie that only enhanced the delightful contours beneath . Her hair was so fair as to resemble frozen water , and her skin almost translucent . Lovely , indeed ! Her bosom heaved again and her mouth worked , but still there was no sound . Evidently the ice enclosure was a perfect sonic barrier . She seemed to be violently protesting something . " But I 'm not here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to rescue you ! I am a friend . " He put his mouth almost on the ice and repeated : " A FRIEND ! " But still she seemed not to understand . She shook her head violently back and forth in negation , her silken tresses flying out like fancy skirts . Her mouth formed exaggerated Os . She seemed to be speaking English , crying " No ! No ! " Could he have encountered a captive Princess who did n't want to be rescued ? A moment 's consideration convinced him that that was not the case . Probably she had been tormented by demons in the forms of rescuers , much in the manner Gaea had been , so assumed that he was another such . Naturally she did n't want to be grasped by a demon . " I 'm Mars , the Incarnation of War ! " he cried , mouthing the words carefully . " The real one ! " She seemed to understand . " Mars , " she mouthed . But then she shook her head in even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconsidered . If she knew he was genuine , why did she remain negative ? Had Lila deceived him about this Princess 's desire to be rescued ? Did Ligeia dislike him personally ? Neither seemed likely . The demoness seemed never to have lied to him before , and this particular deception would be pointless . And the Princess could hardly dislike a man she did n't know . Also , her reaction did not seem to be one of dislike , but rather one of concern . Aha ! If he broke into the box , as he had the palace itself , the flying shards of ice might cut her . Also , the box might protect her from the cold , and a sudden opening might freeze her . He could not be sure that her blanket really was snow ; it might havep192been fashioned to look that way for artistic effect . That could certainly concern her . But he could warm her with his cloak . He demonstrated that to her , opening the cloak , showing that there was room in it for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then again she shook her head in negation . He tapped again on the ice . It was solid , but if he broke it at the end , the shards should not reach her . She could even shield herself with her blanket . He struck the ice harder . It rang , but did not break . The princesswatched , seeming unalarmed by this . Good enough . He found a solid ice lump and used it to bash at the box . The contact was hard , but the ice would not crack . So he returned to the entrance he had broken and picked up the sledge-rock . This would do it ! He returned , hefting the rock . Ligeia remained sitting on her bed , now passive . He slammed the rock into the ice  --  but this ice was harder than that of the palace wall , amazingly , and neither cracked nor flaked . After several attempts , he realized that this was not going to do it . He could not break in this way . Mym set down the rock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next step . How could he rescue a woman from an unbreakable container ? There had to be a way ; after all , she had been sealed into it , so unless it had been constructed around her , there was a way to get by it . She was , he reminded himself , not a mortal person , but a damned soul . Obviously Satan intended to see that no one got her out and gave her a fair hearing . But how could physical substanceimprison a bodiless spirit ? Obviously it was possible , both because she was captive and because the structures of the Incarnations could serve as a barrier to demons , who were evidently as versatile as spirits in physical movement . Perhaps there was some spiritual barrier that seemed solid to souls , though mortals did n't notice it . But he , as an Incarnation , should be able to pass it , and to convey her past it , when she was in contact with him . It was the physical barrier that balked him , not the spiritual one.  |p193That  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harrier , without breaking it ? Abruptly the answer came to him . He could make himself either visible or invisible to mortals , solid or vaporous . He could do the same here . He reached down to touch the Sword  --  and remembered that he had left it outside in the snow . Careless of him ! " Sword , " he murmured , holding out his hand . The great Red Sword appeared in it , scabbard and all . Then Mym willed himself insubstantial and put his hand to and through the icy cover . Ligeia 's eyes widened as she saw this . Mym extended his hand toward her , holding it open , pausing . The Princess hesitated , then slowly extended her own little hand . The two hands touched  --  and passed through each other without resistance . Here was another dilemma ! Though Mym could make himself as insubstantial as a ghost , and Ligeia was a ghost , the two of them were not in the same frame . Maybe in the residences of the Incarnations spirits could seem as solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such interaction was not possible . So he was physically barred when he was solid , and spiritually barred when he was insubstantial . He still could not really touch her and , therefore , could not rescue her . Mym shook his head . Surely Satan was laughing now ! What a fiendish situation ! To have the damsel in distress so near to rescue , yet untouchable . Would he have to go home , leaving her unrescued ? No , he refused to do that . There had to be a way to bring her out of that box , and he intended to find that way . He paced the floor some more , pondering . She was a spirit , a damned soul . He was a mortal , but he had a soul of his own . If he could just set his body aside for a moment , much as he had his horse and his Sword ' And there it was . As an Incarnation , he could do that , he knew . Gaea had mentioned something about the ability to discorporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course there was an element of risk in most things , sometimes directly proportional to theirp194benefit . Whatever the risk , if this could do the job here , it should be worth it . He sat on the floor and leaned back against the wall , so that he needed no effort for support . Then he willed himself out of his body . And he did rise out of it , with no trouble at all . He stood , stepped forward , turned about , and saw his body propped there , unbreathing , lifeless for the moment . But it would reanimate the moment he returned to it , and the returning would be as easy as phasing in to any other body , as he had done so often before . That phasing had to be a variant of this ; his physical body made impalpable , while his soul intergrated with the other . He turned again and approached the box . The Princess 's gaze passed from his body to his soul , perceiving both  --  and abruptly her agitation redoubled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gesturing frantically . " But this is the way I can rescue you , " he replied . " I will just take your hand and bring you out . You will have your chance at last . " She put up her hands , spread out in a stop-stop gesture . She shook her head so violently that her hair became a whirling halo . Her whole aspect cried denial . Mym paused , perplexed . " Are you afraid of me again ? You were n't a moment ago ! " When he paused , she paused . But still she pushed him back , figuratively , with her hands . She did not want him to come to her . " Do n't you want to be rescued ? " Mym asked , knowing she could not hear the words . But it seemed that she did understand the gist . Her hands spread in a gesture of helplessness . She seemed to want to convey something to him , but lacked the means to do it . " Then let me enter , so I can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell me . If there is good reason for me not to rescue you , then I will certainly not force it upon you . I 'm only trying to help . " He took another step . Again she reacted with desperate negation . But this time he did not pause ; he had to get close enough to explain his position to her , to ease her concern . Perhaps she did have reason not to bep195rescued ; he would consider it carefully . His leading hand passed through the ice without resistance , then his arm to the shoulder . It was working . She screamed  --  and as his head passed through , the tail end of that scream suddenly manifested . He reached out and took her hand , and this time the contact was real . They were two spirits now , and felt to each other exactly the way two solid mortals would , for they were equivalently solid . " Ligeia , " he said . " Please , listen to me . I shall not force anything upon you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took her in his arms . She was warm and very soft ; she smelled of spring flowers and new-mown hay , and her tears were wet against his shoulder . It was amazing how physical the spirit realm seemed ! He patted her on the back . " There , there , " he said . " It 's all right , now . I have come to take you away from this . " Suddenly she raised her head and her flowing green eyes met his . " But you ca n't ! " she exclaimed . " I wo n't  --  if you do n't want me to , " he said reassuringly . " Just explain how you feel , and I will honor it . " " Oh , I tried to stop you ! " she wailed . " But you would n't listen ! " " I could n't hear you , " he explained . " But now I can . Just tell me what  --  " " Oh , you do n't understand , " she said . " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " he said reasonably . " Oh , you poor man ! " The tears resumed their flow . " I have no problem , " he protested . " Come , let 's step out of here , and then we can talk . " He leaned forward , extending one hand to the ice wall of the box to get his balance . The hand banged . He looked at it , then tried again . It banged again . The ice was now solid to him . " But only my spirit is here ! " he said , wonderingly . " I just passed through it ! " " That 's what I was trying to tell you , " Ligeia said . " It 's one/way ice . A soul can enter , as I did , as you did  --  but it ca n't leave . We ca n't get out . I tried so hard to warn you ! " " Ca n't get out ? " he asked , bemused . " This is Satan 's trap , " she explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can escape it , except into the rest of Hell . " " I 'm trapped in Hell ? " Suddenly Gaea 's warning returned to him  --  Satan would not meet him in an arena of his choosing . Now he would have to meet Satan in the arena of Satan 's choosing  --  Hell itself . The capsule began to move . It descended through the floor , carrying the two of them with it . They were headed for Hell proper.  |p197The  capsule stopped at a facility very like an airport , coming to rest beside a large glassy building . An accordion-pleated ramp extended out to touch the capsule ; there was a click , and the ice dissolved at the point of contact . " We 're here , " Ligeia said . " Oh , I wish  --  " But she did n't finish , and Mym understood why . What use were wishes in Hell ? " You knew this would happen ? " Mym asked as they set foot on the walk . " The moment I saw you , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fatalism . " Satan told me I was going for a  --  oh , never mind . I was a fool , yet again . " " A hearing ? " Mym asked . " And instead you were bait for a trap . " She nodded grimly and preceded him to the building . He realized that she could be lying . But what was the point ? Whether demoness or genuine damned soul , she had done the job , and he had been caught . He preferred to believe that she was as much a victim of Satan 's deception and cruelty as he . Satan was waiting in the terminal . " Welcome to Hell , Mars ! " he said jovially , stepping forward with his hand extended . Mym considered refusing the hand , but concluded that civility was better than antagonism , even in Hell . He shook the hand.  | " I ca n't say I am completely pleased to be here , " Mym said . " What is the point of this device ? " " Merely to get your attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I am sure that you and I shall come to a perfect understanding . " " I hope so , " Mym said . " It has been my impression that one Incarnation does not interfere with the business of another on a casual basis ; there could be a consequence . " If Satan reacted to the thinly veiled threat , he gave no sign . " Incarnations should always cooperate , " he agreed . " Come , share the hospitality of My domain , and we shall converse . " " If I may go , now  --  " Ligeia murmured . " By no means , My dear , " Satan replied . " This man is a prince ; we shall not foist off on him the company of a woman beneath his station . You shall be his escort while he visits . " " But I really would prefer not to  --  " " Your preference , My dear , is a matter of indifference to Me . I suggest that you put a suitably fair face on the matter . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mym . " It seems I must , " she said . " I assure you , sir , that my reticence does not reflect on you . Are you really a prince ? " " I was , in life , " Mym agreed . " That is behind me , now . Are you really a princess ? " " In life , " she echoed . " Excellent , " Satan said . " The Old Smoky House has palatable fare ; shall we dine there ? " " It seems we shall , " Mym said . He was sure that Satan could not hold him in Hell against his will , but not sure how he was to escape it . He was still to new in this office , so did not yet know how to use his Incarnative powers to their full extent . Until he figured out his best course of action , it was best to make no dramaticand possibly pointless gestures . Ligeia took his arm , and they followed Satan to another chamber . This was set up like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elegantly garbed waiters and waitresses . It surprised Mym to see such an establishment in Hell , but obviously it belonged . He was sure that neither demons nor damned souls required food for sustenance , but if it made them more comfortable to honor the amenities of life , that was all right.  |p199Of  course , most of the souls resident in Hell probably did not actually get to eat ; probably Satan tortured them by allowing them only to smell the good food . " Shall we have steak ? " Satan inquired , surveying the menu . " The flesh of a cow ? " Mym asked . " Urn , true , " Satan said . " You are from India . Perhaps a nice fancy curry then ? " While they dined on curry and the other aspects of an excellent Indian meal , Satan made his pitch . " You and I seem to have been working at cross purposes , Mars , " he said . " When actually we may have a common purpose . " " I doubt that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good , while you represent the force of evil . " " We each represent forces of expedience , " Satan said . " Just as you understand that there must be violence in mortal affairs , so I understand that there must be evil . Sometimes violence abates evil ; sometimes evil abates violence . But the two can go together . " Mym did n't like the sound of this , but he confined his reaction . " In what way ? " " It is My duty to harvest the souls where evil preponderates . But too many souls are shades of gray , with the good and evil so hopelessly intertwined that Thanatos himself can barely distinguishthem . The situation is too complex ; I wish to simplify it by generating more action . " " More violence ? " " Yes . One does not get dirty laundry clean without agitation . Since this aspect falls under your  --  " " So you want me to stir up more war , " Mym said . " Yes . Not too much , just enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In other words , to have more people die . " " That is one way to put it . This activity would of course enhanceyour position . " " And yours , " Mym said . " Because you would reap an earlier and greater harvest of souls . Because the stresses of war would generate famine and slaughter that would not otherwise have existed . "  | " Well  --  " " Not interested , " Mym said , rising from the table . Satan hastened to stay with him . " Of course there could be lagniappe . For example , this borderline soul , the Princess Ligeia , could be made available to you in Purgatory . " " No ! " Ligeia cried . Satan glanced darkly at her , and she shrank back , silenced . Now Mym looked at her . " Satan requires that you remain with us ; I do not . I came to help you , not to oppress you . Certainly I would not take you to the Castle of War if you objected . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not that ! You are a prince , and there are things that only nobility understands . I am sure you would be compatible , and I would gladly go with you , but  --  " " But not at the behest of Satan , as part of a corrupt bargain , " Mym concluded . Mutely , she nodded . Mym liked her attitude . She was correct : there was a camaraderieamong those of royal status that commoners accepted but seldom truly grasped  --  things like the importance of appearances , the routines of palace existence , and the use of concubines . There was much that he would never have to explain to Ligeia , just as he had not to Rapture , and much that she would not have to advise him of . But more than that , it was fitting that royalty consort with royalty . This was one thing that had kept him from dealing with Lila or any other woman . He had to establish a relationship with one of his own station first ; then the rest would fall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him by Satan 's directive . Only her father had the authority to make such a commitment for her . Or , since her father was in another realm , herself . She would make her own commitment , in her own fashion , or make none at all . " We can arrange other habitation for you , woman , " Satan said . " Your mortal rank carries no significance here . " " Let her be , " Mym said gruffly . Satan had just demonstrated the ignorance and insensitivity of the commoner . " Is n't it enough that you hold her here illicitly , and that you used her against her will to bring me here ? Why try to force further corruption on her ? " " This is my domain , Mars , " Satan said evenly . " The deter/mination of treatment is Mine . This slut is overdue for a touch of flame . " Slut ? Mym controlled his blaze of anger . There would be a reckoning for such insults in due course . Satan raised his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and flame appeared . The fire followed the line traced by his finger , moving toward the woman . Mym stood abruptly , flinging the chair to the rear , and stepped into the path of flame . The fire touched his cloak and turned back , unable to penetrate . " Let her be , " Mym repeated . " You accept my offer ? " Satan asked . " The woman 's consent does not matter ; she fears the flame and will cooperate without limit to avoid it . " " I reject the offer , " Mym said . " Then you may remain the guest of this establishment indefinitely  --  andshe will burn while you reconsider . " Satan gestured , and a sheet of flame appeared . Ligeia whimpered . Mym put his arm about her , enfolding her within his protective cloak . The flame leaped up about them both , harming neither . " I believe it is time to see that this woman has a fair hearing , " he said . " You may not be touched , " Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hold her . " He lifted one hand and snapped his fingers . Huge , menacing demons appeared at the entrance to the restaurant . Some had horns and tails and snorted fire ; others had huge crab claws in lieu of hands . They closed in on Mym and the girl . " Get a good hold on her , " Satan directed them . " His substance is not subject to our power , but hers is . Take hold and pull ; he will let her go , lest she be torn apart . " Mym bit his tongue . He was here in spirit only , but he felt the pain and tasted the blood . " Do not touch her , " he warned the demons . " No , I will go with them ! " Ligeia protested . " It is another trap for you , Mars ! Satan means to  --  " Six demons pounced , converging . Two grabbed for her feet , hauling them up and apart . Two more grabbed for her hands , doing the same . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sixth , slavering , opened its tusked face to take a horrendousbite of her bosom . That sixth received Mym 's fist in its teeth . The tusks broke off and the teeth were jammed back into its throat . The demon fell , choking on ivory . It was evident that the powers of Mars remained with him , even in spirit form . But the strength of the other demons was hauling the girl away from Mym 's other arm that held her about the waist . Mym realizedthat to deal with the demons , he would have to have both hands free  --  which meant letting her go . He did n't trust that ; she could be whisked away in an instant , the moment he lost physical contact . How would he ever locate her again in this fell region ? But even though he retained his hold on her , it was no good , because the five demons were trying , literally , to pull her apart . The two on her arms were bracing to haul in opposite directions , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being drawn wide open , and the two on her feet were wedging her legs so far apart that they were spread almost a hundred and eighty degrees . Mym used his free fist to club one of the arm-holding demons on the skull . The skull caved in and the demon fell . Then , moving with the blinding rapidity available to him in the berserker state , he swung his hand across , caught the hair of the hair-pulling demon , and yanked the entire demon up into the air and down against the floor , breaking its hold and body in the process . But the three remaining demons had not left off . Taking advantage of Mym 's own effort , they succeeded in getting Ligeia free of his grasp . He leaped at one of the leg-holding demons , grabbed one of its own legs , lifted it , braced one of his feet against the other leg and forced a split that went into an obtuse angle before the demon 's leg broke off . Mym whirled  --  and saw the two remaining demons dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its hands locked under her shoulders and about her bosom , while the other was using its pincers to clasp her thighs apart while it walked into her . In a moment its evident demon lust wouldLigeia screamed . Mym had never before heard a sound of that nature . It pierced the atmosphere of Hell , like a power saw cutting through metal ,  |p203and  stunned the demons . They fell away , leaving her collapsed and sobbing . Mym was unaffected , protected by his office . So was Satan . " Now you see what she is , " Satan said . " You do n't want to get involved with a creature like that . " " What is she ? " Mym demanded . " A siren , of course . One who destroys with her voice . The secret shame of her royal family ; such defects are not supposed to run in royal lines . That 's what got her sent here . " Secret shame ? Mym , the stutterer , understood very well about that sort of thing . Satan shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she 's of no further use to Me . " He raised his hand . Mym leaped across , again intercepting the flame with his cloak . " I do n't care what she is ; she 's a decent soul ! " " Another reason you ca n't have her , " Satan said . " Had she been willing to cooperate , I would have let her be with you . As it is , I shall treat her unkindly . " He glanced about , noting the sprawled demons . " But first I had better gag her . " He gestured , and a snake appeared , wrapped about Ligeia 's head , its body wedging into her mouth so that she could not speak . Mym realized that there was no way to protect her from Satan 's direct mischief . Not here in Hell . Unless he could manage to hide her , somehow . He took hold of the woman , heaved her up and ran out of the restaurant . Beyond it was a flat , bare plain  --  no place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could change his aspect , and the aspect of anyone with him . Simply by touching the Red Sword . Oops ! He had left that with his body . Still , physical separation did not cut off the Sword 's attachment to him . He should be able to do the magic of the office regardless , even here in Hell . All he had to do was will it . He rendered himself invisible . He hoped . He could still see himself and Ligeia , butSeveral more demons charged out of the restaurant . " And tear her apart ! " Satan 's voice came after them . " Or you 'll be torn in her stead ! " The demons paused , peering about . They saw nothing , though  |p204Mym  and Ligeia were standing near , she with the snake still wrapped about her head . The three of them  --  man , woman and snake  --  could be perceived only by each other , for the moment . Except Satan himself . As another Incarnation , Satan would not be subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Satan emerged . He ran across the plain , carrying her , for she was not moving voluntarily . He knew why ; she did not want to be either a drag or a corrupting influence on him . She was a decent girl who meant no harm , yet had been required to be the agent of much mischief . Probably she would have let the demons take her away to the torture , had one not threatened to rape her on the spot . Suddenly the plain ended . Mym stopped abruptly . This was not a plain , it was the level top of a mesa ! The drop-off was sheer and seemed to extend a kilometer . It was awesome . The demons were spreading out , going over the entire area , searching . Satan had not yet emerged , but could do so at any moment . Mym hurried along the brink , searching for some way down . He did n't want to have to jump . He was a soul , and Ligeia was a soul , so they could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a time and be extremely painful . He might suffer himself ; he was n't sure whether his office protected him from acts of sheer folly in Hell . There was a path , a niche , a crevice leading down ! Mym walked down it , getting them out of the line of sight to the restaurant . For the moment , Satan would not be able to spy them ; that was all that counted . Ligeia struggled , still unable to speak . " Do n't do that ! " Mym warned . " Look where we are ! " She craned her head to look , stiffened , and went slack . She did n't like that sort of height any better than he did . " They 've got to be here somewhere ! " Satan 's voice came . " If not on the mesa , then on the slope . Did you check the slope ? " , Mym knew that in moments this scant path would be swarming with demons . They would not be able to see the fugitives  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , Mars could make himself intangible , invisible , or both at once . But this was not life , and he feared that one spirit could not be made insubstantial to anotherp205spirit . After all , Ligeia had become tangible to him when he encounteredher in spirit form in the capsule in the palace of ice . He could not afford to risk contact with a demon . Yet the invisibility ploy was working , so maybeNow the silhouette of a demon showed at the rim of the mesa . The demon started down the path . Mym looked ahead . The path wended on down and around the mountain . He had to follow it ; there was nowhere else to go . He would not risk contact with any demons unless he had no other alternative . " I 'm setting you down ; stay with me , " he whispered to Ligeia . She shook her head in negation , still unable to speak because of the snake . Mym reached across and took hold of the snake . Quickly he caught its head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was in his power . Then he unwound it , freeing the woman . " You have been very good about this , wanting to spare me further trouble , " he whispered . " But now I 'm in trouble , and so are you . Neither of us has anything to gain at this point by having the demons capture you . If you leave me now , all it could do would be to give away my location . Do you want that ? " She shook her head no . " Then follow me , " Mym said . " As long as you stay close , you will remain invisible . " He turned , holding the snake with one hand , and proceeded down the path . A short distance down , the path widened , and an overhang developed . This was a relief , because any slip would send them tumbling off the mountain . Mym saw that there was a hole in the overhang ; perhaps this was the remains of an ancient cave . But the path continued on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Mym did n't pause . Then he heard something . Demons  --  ahead ! They were coming up the path from below ! " We 're trapped ! " Ligeia moaned . " But I can scream at them  --  " " And alert the whole of the rest of Hell to our location ! " Mym returned . " Keep your mouth shut ! " He considered momentarily . " We 'll have to try that cave . "  | " Oh , I hate caves ! " she said . He ignored that . They moved back up the path , and to the cave . The demons above were getting close . " I 'll boost you up , " he said . " Then I 'll follow . " He wished he had the Red Sword ; with that he could have flown right off the mountain . Well , maybe he could do that anyway . After all , if the invisibilityworkedHe tried it , willing himself into the air , while Ligeia made her way cautiously up the rock . Nothing happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have the Sword right with him in order to travel . Perhaps it needed to see exactly where he was going in order to operate . Or maybe he simply did n't have the right mental key for remote control . Too bad . He boosted her by the pert bottom , and she scrambled up into the hole . " Very well  --  here 's the snake , " he said , handing up the reptile . Ligeia seemed less than eager to handle it again , but took it . Then he fitted his hands to the edges of the hole and heaved himself up . She was there to help him navigate the edge . It was a small cave , hardly more than an etching in the mountain , but large enough to hold them comfortably . The snake settled down to the side , seeming satisfied . The demons reached the overhang , talking gruffly among themselves . " Oh , I 'm afraid ! " Ligeia whispered . Mym put his arm about her shoulders . " Remember , they can not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was quiet , though her body shivered . The demons tromped by from the upper path , grumbling ; evidently they felt that this search was so much foolishness . Mym wondered how they could be so similar to mortals in their minor reactions , if they were soulless constructs of ether . They should have no personality , but that was obviously not the case . Perhaps demons were crafted in Satan 's image , much the way man , according to the occidental mythos , was crafted in God 's image . Of course that was illusory ; how could such imperfection come from perfection ? Man had a delusion of grandeur . Mym was glad that he did not share such confused thinking . Reincarnation made so much more sense that any sensible person should be able to understand it.  |p207The  upper demons met the lower demons . There was an outcry , and the sound of a brief skuffle ; then a descending wail as one of them fell or was thrown off the ledge . Irascible creatures , demons ! Now the demons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledge , " one was muttering . " I do n't care what His Foulness says ! We 'd have found them , if  --  " " The cave  --  did you check the cave , you moron ? " another demanded . " What cave , imbecile ? " the other asked . " That cave , idiot ! " the other retorted . " The one we use to entertain that demoness in our slack time . " " Oh , that cave , " the first demon said . " Where is that demoness , now ? I have n't seen her in a century . " " She 's on sunside duty , " the second replied . " Seducing some mortal . " " Some mortals have all the luck , " the first muttered . His tusked face poked into the cave from below . Ligeia stiffened , for the demon was staring right at them . But the creature 's gaze passed through them , and it saw nothing but the cave . They truly were invisible . Then the demon spotted the snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ambiance of his power . The demon reached for the snake , but the snake rose up hissingly and opened its jaws wide , and the demon thought the better of it . His head ducked down . " Nothing but wildlife here . " " Well , let 's go back , " the other demon said . " Either they fell off the mountain , or they never were on this path . I do n't know why Satan 's so hot to get them ; they ca n't escape Hell anyway . " " He wants to torture the woman , rotface , " the first said . " She was supposed to corrupt the Incarnation , and she tried to bug out , so she 's in for it . " " Yeah , I hope Satan gives her to me to play with , " the second said as they resumed their tromp up the path . " I 'd bring her right hack here to this cave and really work her over ! Did you see those legs of hers when we held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snotpuss ! I saw all the way up ... " The sound faded as they departed.  | " Oh , I hate those demons ! " Ligeia whispered . " All they think about is lust and torture ! " " Well , Hell is supposed to be an unpleasant place , " Mym responded , " to make the damned souls regret their crimes in life . " " But I do n't belong in Hell ! " she exclaimed . " I think we 'd better wait here until the demons give up the search , " Mym said . " That could be some time . Why do n't you tell me how you came to be here ? I came here to help you and I still hope to do so . " " You ca n't help me , " she retorted . " I can only hurt you . You should get away from me right now . " " Why ? You seem like a nice young woman , apart from your obvious virtue as a princess . " " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd probablylike me if you knew me , especially since you seem to be immune to my scream . That 's why you need to get away . " " Maybe I 'm being dense . I do n't follow the logic . " " Because that 's what Satan wants ! " she exclaimed . " He wants you to  --  to  --  " " To treat you as the demons would ? I would n't do that , Ligeia . " " To fall in love with me , " she blurted . Mym smiled . " I have been in love before and I ca n't say that that is a fate worse than death . They were good women , very good women . If you are a good woman  --  " " Because you 're an Incarnation , Satan can not hold you any longer than he can fool you , which should n't be long . But I 'm a damned soul , and he can hold me ; if you fall in love with me , then you wo n't leave without me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll be trapped forever in Hell and Satan 'll have his way with the mortal realm ! " she exploded . So that was Satan 's plot ! No wonder Lila had told him of the imprisoned Princess ! And was it Lila that the demons had taken to this same cave ? An interesting coincidence that they should happen to mention it just when he was here to hear . Coincidence ? Deception , more likely ! Was n't it possible that Satan knew exactly where he was  --  and had instructed the demonsto leave him here , because he was doing what Satan wanted  --  being with Ligeia ? And Ligeia , by all the signals , wasp209a genuinely loveable woman , no part of this plot . Had she been in on it , she should not have warned him of its nature . Yes , this was very interesting . The demons had gotten Ligeia away from Mym and could have removed her to some far reach of Hell so that he could never have found her . But they had paused , seemingly foolishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her devastating scream , so that Mym had had a renewed chance to rescue her . It was possible that the demons had been stupid and had given away to their lusts prematurely  --  but Satan had merely stood and watched . Satan had not started organizing the pursuit until it was too late . Satan was no fool ; therefore his lack of initiative must have been deliberate . He had wanted Ligeia to scream , so as to enable Mym to rejoin her . That scream  --  that was a most remarkable thing . Others might consider it an ugly thing . But Mym , who had a problem with his own voice , was in a position to understand a liability like that . He felt some empathy . He was n't stuttering now , but he was in Hell , where Satan 's power eliminated it ; his consciousness of it remained . Ligeia was a fellow sufferer  --  and Satan had wanted him to see that . Naturally a man who had suffered because of a problem with his voice would be attracted to a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " You are silent , " Ligeia said . " Now you understand . I thank you for being the man you are and now I shall do what I must do and leave you . " She started to move toward the cave entrance . Mym held her back . " I am not leaving without you , " he said . " But I told you why that ca n't be ! You have a responsibility on Earth ! " " I came to Hell to rescue you  --  and rescue you I shall , " Mym said . " This has nothing to do with love , but with what is right . If I should fall in love with you in the process , perhaps you will agree to be with me after you have had your hearing and are free of Hell . If not  --  I still mean to do what I know to be right . " " You 're a fool ! " she said . " I 'm a man . " " A prince , " she said , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  get very pleased with that kind of a fool , " she con/fessed . " But I ca n't let you do it . I am only one soul ; your work affects millions . So  --  " She got up again . He hauled her back , held her down , and kissed her . She sighed . " You know you really are n't being fair about this , " she said . Then she kissed him back . " Let 's get to know each other , " he said . " You already know my curse . When I get excited  --  " " I know about curses . I 'm a stutterer . " She laughed . " Not that I 've noticed ! " " In life . Here in Hell I am spared it . I think it 's Satan 's way of subverting me . He offered me a demon concubine and free speech , but I prefer to make my own way . " " But if your curse is gone in Hell , why does mine remain ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subvert you . He 's trying to degrade you . He probably would not bother to abate my stutteringif I were n't an Incarnation . " " The Incarnation of War , " she agreed . " You rate special treatment . " " So if stuttering bothers you , you will not want to associate with me , once we get out of Hell . " " When I saw you , there in the Palace of Ice , you looked so bold and handsome , really like a prince coming to rescue me , " she said . " I knew it was a trap and I tried to warn you away . But you would n't go , and now the trap is sprung , and maybe the second one too , because you still wo n't go . I suppose it 's academic , because I 'll never get out of Hell , but if I were out , and you got me out , I 'd always know that it was the stutterer who did it and I would n't care what you looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But you really did n't come to the Palace of Ice just to pick up a woman , did you ? Not when you had a demoness at your beck ? " So Mym told her about Orb , about Rapture , and his desire for a woman of that level , rather than a protean demoness whose ultimate loyalty was to Satan . " Though Lila did shed a tear , " he said at the end . " I do n't know why a demoness would do that . " " Because it was her business to corrupt you or to send you to Hell ; either way , she knew you would be doomed . Demons do have some little emotion , otherwise they could n't enjoy the basep211desires . They ca n't animate the human form without picking up a bit of human nature , so as to act well enough to fool real people . She probably liked you a trifle , or maybe liked her assignment in Purgatory , which is a better place than Hell , so was sorry when she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , when it does n't conflict with her assignment , she can afford some emotion . Especially if showing it might cause you to react in a manner helpful to her mission . " " You seem to know a lot about demons , " Mym said ruefully . " I have had recent experience . " Then she told him how she had come to Hell . Ligeia had been a European princess . When she came of age and was versed in the things needful for her role , her father the King had begun shopping about for a suitable match for her . " These things are seldom left to individual choice , you know , " she said . " I know , " Mym agreed . Part of that shopping entailed showing the wares . Contemporarymonarchs had become canny , as their sons acquired modernisticnotions of independence , and facilitated cooperation by seeking brides who were not only advantageously connected , but who were personally attractive . In fact , it was often possible to use a young prince 's idealistic notions to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the beauty of the prospective bride , he paid little heed to anything else until it was too late . He was trapped by love . " I know , " Mym repeated , remembering how well that ploy had worked with Rapture . " Well , you do n't have to agree so readily ! " she said . " I am already blinded by your beauty , " he said . He intended it as humor , but realized as he spoke that it was not . Ligeia evidentlyhad a similar realization , for she blushed . It was dark in the cave , but he knew she was blushing because her whole body seemed to radiate heat . The embarrassment of royalty was a more potent thing than that of ordinary folk . So , she continued after a delicate pause , she was to be shipped to a Mid-East kingdom for a visit , nominally a routine courtesy , actually a demonstration of exactly what her kingdom had to offer . Her father knew there was no princess currently on thep212market to match her appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent her liability from being exposed . But international terrorists had seen their chance to strikeThey managed to skyjack the airplane she was on . They de- manded a phenomenal ransom for her , even while the plane was still in flight  --  one billion Eurodollars , release of all political pris- oners , a public apology for misgovernment , that sort of thing . I the King paid , they would land the plane in a neutral country and let her go ; if notThe King refused to acknowledge their demands . The money was easy , the release of prisoners problematical , and the apology impossible , of course . " Of course , " Mym agreed , understanding perfectly . The King approached the matter forthrightly . He put out notice that a reward would be given for the severed heads of the conspirators . They arranged to show their determination by putting her image on a magic mirror . They set up the mirror , but Ligeia refused to perform ; she would not demean herself by begging her father to buy her freedom . Balked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided on a more direct demonstration . They stripped her naked and one of them prepared to rape her  --  on camera , as it were . Itwas evident that they had had some such notion in mind even since seeing her , for they were men . " Not all men are like that , " Mym protested . " You do n't desire my body ? " she inquired challengingly . Mym sighed . There was no respectable answer he could give to that . Seeing that practically all was lost , and with the fell pirate al- most upon her , Ligeia had screamed . After all , submission public rape was no more possible for a princess than a public apology was for a king . In private , a different standard obtained After a princess got married , both rape and apology were likely perhaps even necessary . But not desirable , Mym remarked . Every other person aboard the plane had lost consciousness Ligeia , of course , did not know how to pilot it . So the plan crashed , and all aboard were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in Hell , " she concluded . " But you did nothing worthy of damnation ! " Mym protested . " That is my claim , " she agreed . " Technically I did commit suicide  --  but it was to protect my virtue . And I was responsibleor many deaths  --  but it was self-defense , and they were evil men. feel that if I could only get a fair hearing , the powers who beshould agree that I should go to Heaven . But it seems that myscroll was charged with both murder and suicide , and so I wasdamned . Of course I would have been damned had I submitted , too . " " Damned if you do and damned if you do n't , " Mym agreed . " And then Satan had the temerity to force me to  --  I tried to warn you away , but  --  " " The thing to do , " Mym said firmly , " is to turn Satan 's trap against him . To get out of Hell . That would serve him right . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she protested . Only you alone can win free , if you know how . I can only do if I get my hearing , and Satan will never allow that . " " How can he prevent it ? " Mym asked , nettled . " Does n't God have anything to say about it ? " " God does n't interfere in the affairs of mortals or with the carnations , " she said despairingly . " Well , I am under no such restriction , " Mym said . " I shall get you out . " " That is exactly what Satan wants you to try , " she reminded him . " I am disinclined to disappoint him . " Mym considered . " Do you think Satan is listening to us now ? " " Well , we 're hiding from him  --  " " It is in my mind that Satan permitted us to reach this place , " he said . " He surely can tune in on us . This is , after all , his domain . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Hell is a very big region . I 'm sure he ca n't devote his attention to every littledetail all the time . Once he knew we were together , he probably went on to other business . " " Probably , " Mym agreed . " So we can consider our conversationprivate . " She shrugged . " I suppose so . But it does n't matter . I ca n't get  |p214out  and , as long as I prevent you from getting out , I am serving his purpose . I do n't like that , though I do like being with you . " She was probably correct , Mym thought . She had served as the lure to bring him in , and now served as the chain to keep him here . Satan had no need to watch them . Yet it was hardly unpleasant , being here with Ligeia . She was a nice girl , with compatible values , and extraordinarily pretty , and he had always been fascinated by that type . He changed his position , as the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake . The snake was watching him . Mym completed his adjustment as if he had not noticed , but his mind was suddenly awhirl . Surely it was true that Satan had worse things to do than watch two people get acquainted . But Mym was an Incarnation , and , though Satan could penetrate the veil of invisibility Mym had invoked , he probably could n't do it from any distance . One Incarnation could not interfere with anotherfrom a distance . So Satan probably was n't tuning in on them directly . But Satan would not want to let an Incarnation move about Hell unsupervised . He would have to have some way to keep track . And what better way would there be than to assign a lesser minion ? The snake was that minion . It would report on Mym 's location at all times and on any important activity Mym indulged in . That would certainly be a convenient way to keep track . He could touch the snake , phase in with it , and learn for sure . But that might alert Satan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seem not to have caught on . But how could he tell Ligeia , without the snake hearing ? And how could he get away from the snake , without alerting it and Satan ? Well , he could phase in to Ligeia and plant a thought in her mind . But at this point he preferred not to do that , because it would be an invasion of what little privacy she might have , and because she was , indeed , a young woman he was quite ready to like and perhaps love . Too great an intimacy could spoil such a relationship . Or was he afraid that if he phased in to Ligeia he would discover  |p215that  she was merely another agent of Satan 's ? It was a possibility he had to consider . If she was , not only would he be disappointed , but his verification of her could betray his suspicion to Satan himself . That would leave him with nothing . He considered some more and decided that he would have to keep whatever escape plan he might have to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a plan  --  a bold , wild one that only he had any chance of implementing . If he could implement it successfully , not only would he rescue Ligeia , he Would be able to rescue many other unfairly damned souls . In ddition , it would amply repay Satan for his audacity in trying to rap another Incarnation in Hell and force him to do Satan 's will . It was n't the nice way and certainly it was n't the easy way . But Mym was Mars and he felt that the honor of his office was at stake . He wanted to teach Satan a lesson about interfering with Mars.  |p216When  night fell in Hell , they were satisfied that the pursuit had ended . They had talked and slept and now were eager to get out of the cramped cave . " I believe there is some way out of Hell , " Mym said . " I intend to find it . Do you have any idea where it might be ? " Ligeia considered . " For you , many ways . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not use the exit by yourself , but I could enable you to use it . " She brightened . " Maybe  --  oh , dare I hope ? " " It is better to hope than to have no hope . " " I have hoped many times and always had my hope dashed . " " There 's always hope that this time your hope wo n't be dashed . " She smiled . " For you , I will entertain that hope . But I really do n't know where an exit would be . The River Styx circles all of Hell , and only the ferryman Charon can take a soul across . That he will not do , except by the order of Satan . " " But Hell is three dimensional ! " Mym protested . " How can one river surround it all ? " " I do n't know , " she said , surprised . " And we came down from above , so there must be a route there , " he persisted.  | " Yes , there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of that . But I still do n't know how to use such an exit . " It occurred to Mym that if Hell were like Purgatory , its apparentthree dimensionality could be an actual two dimensions , so that one river could indeed enclose it all . The descending capsule could have carried them right through the River Styx , charmed by Satan 's order . But he saw no point in bring up such morbid speculation . " What we need to do is inquire , " he said . " There is sure to be someone who knows and will tell us . But we ca n't question the damned souls openly , or Satan will shut off any exit that we find . " " We could use the back route , " she said . " The demons do n't go there , because  --  " " Back route ? " " There are roads and things for the front route , but the demons use those , so anyone who does n't belong would be challenged and caught very soon . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd have to become visible to talk with anyone , and then the demons might see . But the back route is through the wilderness  --  the marshes around the rivers , mainly . But though there are n't demons , there are other things , like monsters and natural hazards . I do n't know whether  --  " " What happens to a person caught by a monster or a natural hazard ? " " A lot of discomfort or pain , mainly , " she said . " We really ca n't die here , but it would hurt a lot to be chomped up and eaten by a monster , and then you 'd be in its belly . I really would n't enjoy that . " That was something to think about . Could a monster consume Mars ? Probably not . But it could consume Ligeia . Could he protecther from such threats ? Perhaps he could , by keeping her in contact with him . " I think I can guard you from that . Are you willing to risk it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Satan would do to me , if  --  " She did n't finish , and Mym knew why . If she failed her assignment of trapping him in Hell , for all that she had never agreed to do it , she would be punished in Hell 's worst fashion . There were indeed fates worse than death , and Hell was the place where these were suffered.  | " I have a tentative plan of escape , " Mym said carefully . " I ca n't tell you exactly what it is , because news might reach Satan . " He flicked his eyes toward the snake without moving his head , hoping that she would understand the signal while the snake missed it . " But it requires that I meet with the various leaders of the souls of Hell  --  not the ones doing Satan 's business , but the ones who are genuinely interested in human welfare . I presume that , though these souls are damned , they are not totally evil . Can the back route get me to these souls , and can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snake . " Yes . " How comprehensive an answer was that ? Whatever it was , he had to accept it . They climbed down out of the cave and to the ledge , and the snake slithered after them . That was fine with Mym ; he did not want to get rid of the snake , because then Satan would have to assign some other creature to snoop , and that one might be more effective . Also , the snake served as the pretext for him not to speak his true plan aloud , so that he did not have to share it with Ligeia . He disliked having to distrust her , but she was serving as an agent of Satan , and he could not be quite , quite certain of her ultimate loyalty . It was nervy business , walking down the narrow ledge in the dark , but necessary . They proceeded slowly for hours , winding around the mountain , and finally , as dawn was threatening , they reached the base . They were both tired , so sought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit form was no more anomalous than dawn in Hell . Mym 's body seemed fully physical to him ; it even had naturalfunctions , requiring him to borrow the cover of a bush for a minute . It seemed that if one ate in the Afterlife , one also digested and eliminated ; if one labored , one became tired . They formed a bower  --  a shelter of boughs  --  under a leaning tree , making a bed of leaves and fern . They lay down to sleep  --  and the bugs located them . This was Hell , of course ; naturally there were obnoxious vermin . But Mym simply enfolded Ligeia in his cloak , and the bugs could not get to them . Of course this made it more difficult to sleep , because she was very warm and soft against him . He hadp219sought her because he was in need of a woman , but he was n't quite sure of her , and of course a princess was not a concubine , so he did not want to move things along too hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore her contact and sleep . " A penny for your thoughts , " she murmured . " No sale . " " Are you sure you do n't desire me ? " " Of course I desire you ! " he snapped . " But  --  " " That 's nice , " she said . " But do n't worry ; I wo n't corrupt you . " And she fell asleep . How nice for her . Did she , as a pampered princess , even know what male desire signified ? She had to , for she had been threatenedwith rape both as a mortal and as a spirit . But probably she assumed that nice men were different and expressed desire only as an intellectual compliment with no physical component . Well , he would try to honor that notion . Certainly if he had really wanted concubinage without content , he could have had it in Lilith/Lila . Lilith . Lila . Ligeia . He had not before realized how similar those names were . Could it be that  --  ? No ! That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a fool Satan would be making of him , if he had been tricked into trapping himself in Hell for the same creature he had renouncedin Purgatory ! If he was now torturing himself with desire unfulfilled for a damned amoral demoness ! He could phase in to her and learn her identity for certain . He knew that he should . But still he refrained . Suppose Ligeia turned out to be genuine , and his intrusion betrayed his distrust ? How would she react to him then ? He would not blame her for feeling betrayed . Was he weighing the risk of his actual betrayal against her mere feeling of betrayal ? There could be no question of the appropriate course to take . Yet he could not . She stirred . " Why are you tense ? " she asked . " Just thinking . " " Are you sure you wo n't tell me ? " " You would not like it . " " I do n't see how your thoughts could be worse than the rest of Hell . "  |p220She  had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who and what you say you are . " " I am , " she said , then reconsidered . " Oh , you mean you doubt ? I suppose that 's sensible . Who else do you think I might be ? " " Lilith , the demoness . " She became fully alert . " The one who went to the cave with the demons ? You think I  --  ? " " I told you you would n't like it . " " I do n't ! But I suppose you are right to wonder . Demons can assume any form , so she could make herself look just like me . But how can I prove my identity ? " " There is a way , " he said reluctantly . " That 's what men always say , is n't it ? But I understand that demons are better at it than genuine people are , so  --  " " As the Incarnation of War , I have certain powers . One of them is the ability to  --  " " To incite violence , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it now ! " This was exactly the kind of entanglement he had wanted to avoid . But now he was in it and had to slog through . " Also to phase in to people , to occupy their bodies and minds and grasp their thoughts . " " Oh . " She considered . " I thought you meant another kind of penetration . " " I would not practice either on you without your consent , " he said stiffly . " This phasing in , so you can read my mind  --  does it mean I can also read yours ? " That notion startled him . " I 'm not sure . When I have done it with mortals , they were unaware of my intrusion . But I could project my thoughts to them . I suppose , if one realized what the situation was , he might have read my thoughts on his own . " " Then phase in to me , " she said . " But if you should be a demoness  --  " " Then Satan will know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turnabout is fair play , is n't it ? " It did make sense . He had distrusted her ; she could distrust  |p221him  . He wanted to trust her ; surely she wanted to trust him . The phasing in would resolve all doubts , one way or the other . " But do you realize that this can be a more intimate association than any physical one could be ? " he asked , still hesitant . " I would rather be known than unknown , " she said simply . So he phased in . For a moment he had trouble orienting , and was afraid that it would n't work when there was no mortal body to anchor to . But then he realized that in the mortal realm he had used the physical body to fix the spiritual essence in place ; on this occasion it could be done directly . He overlapped her  --  and discovered that not only was it possible to do it without the physical bodies , it was much easier , because there was no flesh to get in the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was genuine . All that she had told him was true . Her mind was so straightforward , and the merging so complete , that there was absolutely no doubt . So that 's the plan ! he thought with surprise . No , that 's not your thought , it 's mine , the thought followed immediately . Ligeia 's . The rapport was so thorough that he had mistaken her thought for his own ! He had never anticipated success like this ! Why had she even been concerned about  --  wait , whose thought was this ? His or hers ? Does it matter ? Confused , Mym disengaged . They lay there , both their bodies radiant with the experience , assimilating the enormous impact of the prior few moments . Truly , they had known each other for an instant . Now Mym discovered that he could recollect greater detail in Ligeia 's memories than he had been aware of before . He seemed to have acquired part of her mind . " It was right to let Rapture go , though you still loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked , knowing it was so . " Your memories become you , " she said . " You are a decent man . I can see why you are wary of the demoness ; that business with the talking head  --  " " I had no idea that the phase would be that complete , Li ! "  | " I know , Mym , I know , " she said . " How well we know each other so suddenly ! " " It was worth it . " " It was worth it , " he repeated . " I think we shall very soon be in love . " " Very soon , " he agreed . " For the first time in my Afterlife , I am glad I went to Hell . " " I know . " He kissed her . The acquaintance that should have taken months had been accomplished in seconds . Now , secure in their knowledge of each other , they slept . Ligeia did know her way generally about Hell . She had found a map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book described the various regions and tortures available ; the showing of it had not been any favor to her , but a threat . She had been terrified by the threat , but she had remembered the pretty map . " The River Lethe originates near the center , and that is where Satan 's private retreat is , " she said . " So we should discover its source spring near here . " " Lethe  --  the water of forgetfulness ? " he asked . " My mythologyis not yours , but I seem to remember that . " " True . If we thirst , we had better not drink that water , for we will not even remember our mission thereafter . " They walked along , and the snake followed , and they found the spring , and thirst smote Mym , but he knew he could not drink . The clear water bubbled up from the white sand below , forming a lovely pool surrounded by rich vegetation . There were several canoes on a rack beside it . This was evidently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in Hell , " Mym remarked . " It 's a trap . Unwary souls who flee the work gangs find theirway here and choose to boat and swim in the water , and  --  " " I see . Satan does love to torture insidiously . " " But we can use a canoe , " she said . " It does n't matter if we get splashed , as long as none of it gets in our mouths . Of course it might not be smart actually to swim in it . " " Not smart at all , " he agreed . " The rivers lead to every major section of Hell . Some of them are pretty nasty . That 's why there is n't much traffic on them . "  |p223They  lifted a canoe and turned it over . It was made of aluminum  --  orwhatever passed for it in the Afterlife  --  and was light . They set it in the water and climbed carefully in . The snake joined them . There were two aluminum paddles with it , too . It floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to drink the water to forget , " Mym said . " This is such a pleasant place . " " Appearances can be deceptive , " she said . They paddled . Mym had had experience with this sort of thing and had the rear seat ; he kept a straight course by sculling , while Ligeia paddled on either side in front . They guided it to the outlet , where the flow of the river commenced . The water was calm ; only the slightest current was felt . The vegetation grew richly up to the shore , and trees overhung , so that the stream seemed to be passing under a green canopy . Small fish swam below , and turtles were at the fringe . It was hard indeed to remember that this was Hell ! But soon the stream entered a marshy region where water plants encroached . The plants seemed innocent  --  hyacinths  --  but Mym was cautious . This was , after all , Hell . Sure enough , as they glided close , he saw little feeler-threads writhing out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sap flowing that resembled saliva . Those plants were hungry for more than water . " Stay clear of those plants , " he warned Ligeia . " The hungrycinths , " she agreed . " They will leave nothing but bones , if they get the chance to feed . " Mym wondered how a spirit-person could have bones . But surely he did , here in Hell . He liked this quiet stream less . They found a channel by the plants , but there were more and more of the things , and soon they could go no farther without forging directly through . " I think we 'd better do it rapidly , " Mym said . " If we travel swiftly enough , they wo n't be able to get hold . " They gathered momentum and struck the bank of plants at speed . The drag was immediately felt . The canoe slowed , partly from the sheer clogging mass of plants , and partly from the latching-onof their hairlike tentacles . They continued paddling , but soon became bogged down . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p224over  the sides of the canoe , reaching in with their feelers . Sap fairly drooled . Mym lifted his paddle high and brought it down beside the canoe , smashing at the plants . They were crushed down with a sick vegetable squishing sound . He smashed again , at those on the other side , freeing what he could reach of the canoe . " Knock them away ! " he called to Ligeia . " Then we can move on through ! " She lifted her paddle and brought it down . But her motion was ineffective and dislodged only a few plants . " Harder ! " Mym called . His own plants were crowding in again . She struck harder  --  and water splashed up against Mym . He shielded his face instinctively . His right arm was spattered  --  and where the droplets touched , spots of numbness developed . The water of Lethe was making his very flesh forget ! " Do n't splash ! " he cried . " Oops ! " She restricted her effort and managed to get most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We can do it . " They both worked hard , and the canoe began to move reluctantly . Now the action of the paddles tended to clear the plants from the sides . But it was a lot of work for excruciatingly slow progress . At last they forged out of the band of plants and into clear water . But there were more hungrycinths ahead . Mym peered about , trying to spy the route of least resistance , but all looked equally bad . No matter which way they went , there would be a struggle . They made the struggle , navigating interminable rafts of vegetation , and at last came to a weather-worn landing . " This is our first stop , " Ligeia said breathlessly . " Why do n't I wait in the canoe while you talk to the man ? " He glanced at her , surprised . He was sure she did not want to be separated from him , here in the hind region of Hell . Then he saw the snake and realized that they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dialogue with the leader of the damned souls . He trusted Ligeia completely now , and she trusted him  --  but neither of them trusted the snake . So she was volunteeringto keep the snake here , providing him the necessary privacy . This was a brave and good gesture on her part.  | " Yes , I can see you are tired , " he said . " You stay here and rest , and I will return as soon as I can . " Then Mym went and found the leader of the damned souls , who was engaged in shoveling muck out of a canal-ditch . Naturally the muck seeped back in , then phased in to the skeptical man . The contact , as it had been with Ligeia , was instantly perfect , and the man understood the full nature of Mym 's plan and acquiesced . Much sooner than would otherwise have been the case , Mym was back at the canoe . " We 'll have to ask the next , " Mym said shortly . That was for the benefit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wanted  --  news of a secret exit from Hell . They paddled on downstream , and in due course the River Lethe debouched into a river of an entirely different nature . This one was largely frozen . Ice rimmed its shore and closed in on the center current , leaving only a narrow channel . Icicles hung from the neighboring trees . " What in Hell is that ? " Mym inquired , surprised . " The River Kokytus , " Ligeia informed him . " The waters of lamentation . " " I lament the moment I committed myself to this voyage , " Mym muttered . " We 'll freeze ! " " Does n't your cloak protect you ? " " It should . But what about you ? " " I may have to help you paddle from the rear seat . " They nudged the canoe into the frozen Kokytus . Immediately a cutting crosswind developed , shoving the canoe sidewise towardthe ice . Ligeia had to put her paddle out to stave off a collision , and Mym did the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair across her face , quickly chilling her . " Come back here with me ! " Mym cried . " Before you freeze . " " But then the ice  --  " " You ca n't endure that cold wind long ! " She had to agree . She made her way back to him , and got under the cover of his cloak . But now the canoe was weighted down at the back , and lifting  |p226out  of the water at the front . The wind turned it about so that the front overrode the ice . They were unable to paddle it forward . " I 'll have to go back to my seat , " Ligeia said , shivering with the expectation . " It 's the only way we can  --  " " No ! I wo n't have you freezing ! " " But you have to talk with  --  " But Mym had a notion . " Let 's see if we can travel on the ice ! " he exclaimed . They tried it . They paddled madly and rammed the canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no farther , they moved up to the front end , overbalancing it and lifting the rear out of the water . Then some scraping and shoving with the paddles got the remainder onto the ice . After that it was n't hard . They simply poled the canoe across the ice , downstream . The liability had become an asset . But when they came to the landing for the next meeting , the problem of cold resumed . If Ligeia remained with the canoe , she would freeze . But if she did not " Actually , that snake 's torpid , " Mym said . " It 's coldest in the bottom of the boat , where it touches the ice . " Ligeia checked . The snake was curled up , trying to husband some warmth , but obviously not succeeding . " The poor thing , " she murmured . " I 'd better get it to somewhere warmer . " " That reptile is  --  " Mym started , but could n't finish , because he did n't want the snake to know he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care what kind of creature it is , it should n't be allowed to freeze . " She reached into the canoe and carefully picked up the snake . Mym was disgusted . He would have been glad to be rid of the snake in a coincidental manner , so that Satan would not catch on . At the same time , he appreciated the softer nature of Ligeia , who , however foolishly , was being caring . So they walked away from the frozen river , and Ligeia carried the snake along , warming it . The souls of this region resembled snow monsters as they struggled to carry baskets of snow through the drifts . Obviously they had been assigned this work for the same reason the others had to slop muck endlessly  --  pointless misery . The demons in charge were in a high tower , evidently warmed by a stove , becausep227smoke issued from its chimney . That meant that the workers were not closely supervised  --  but it seemed the demons kept track of the deliveries , for as Mym watched , a snow-bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air and landed on a laggard worker , burying him in snow . Another worker saw the two of them . " New recruits ? " he asked . " Here , I 've got an extra coat for the lady . " He paused to strip his outer layer , a furred jacket , battered but good . " But you need that yourself ! " Ligeia protested . " Not as much as you do , " the man said , handed her the jacket , and resumed his plodding . It was a help , for now she was able to walk alone . Mym located the leader and matched his step , speaking briefly to him while Ligeia walked some distance behind . Then Mym phased in with the man , and in a moment the understanding was complete ; the man would spread the word , and these people would cooperate . Mym disengaged , walked along for another minute , then broke away , trusting that neither the supervising demon nor the snake Ligeia carried had comprehended the true nature of his contact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like bad people , " Mym remarked as they resumed their skid along the ice . " They really are n't , " she agreed . " Of course I am bringing you to the best groups , the ones who were only marginally evil to begin with and who have probably expiated enough of their sin to qualify for Heaven , except that Satan never does let anyone go , regardless . I understand some of the damned souls in other regions are really bad . " " That man gave you his coat , " Mym persisted . " Should n't that count on his balance card , a good deed ? " " It should , " she agreed . " But he did n't do it for that , because they all know Satan wo n't let them go anyway . " " Which is the truest positive act  --  sacrifice without hope of reward . " " I wish we could help these people , somehow , " she said . " If we find our avenue of escape , some of them may use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood exactly what he had in mind . " Yes . " The snake , recovered from its lethargy of cold , perked up . Itwas now coiled about one of Ligeia 's legs , warmed by her bodyp228without interfering with her use of the paddle . Mym wondered how it reported to Satan , whether it had to make periodic checkins , or whether it was telepathic . Probably the former ; the latter would have betrayed them already , for it would have read their minds and not have to listen to their words . Perhaps it was a variety of demon that could vaporize at will , zip away to report , and return while they were sleeping . That was what Mym was counting on . The Kokytus debouched into a broad and quiet river , and the ice gave way to polluted water . This was easier to canoe through , but unpleasant to see and smell . " Which one is this ? " " The Acheron , " she replied , removing her jacket , as the air had warmed . " River of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The clear , clean spring water is forgetful . The frozen stream is lamenting . And the polluted one has sorrows . " " What greater sorrow is there than the destruction of what once was lovely ? " she asked . He sighed agreement . " Yet the mortals are doing their best to make all their rivers like this . " " The mortal world is going to Hell . Anybody can see that , from this vantage . But it 's sad . " " If only they would understand and change course ! " he said . " Maybe if mortal people could only see Hell or hear about how it really is , before ... " " But , every mortal person has to die before seeing Hell , and then it 's too late . " That was the crux of the problem . It meant that Satan stood a fair chance to prevail , because of the ignorance of mortals . The river narrowed and the current accelerated . " I hope there are n't rapids ! " Mym muttered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The river forked . " Which way do we go ? " Mym asked . " I do n't know . They probably rejoin after a bit , so maybe it does n't matter . " Mym steered the canoe into the left channel , which seemed to be the more navigable of the two . All went well  --  until they came up against a fallen tree . It hung slantwise over the water , blocking progress.  | " We can duck under it , " Mym said . They coasted up to it , and both squeezed down low , and they passed under the trunk . But as they did , several objects dropped from it into the canoe . Mym thought they were bits of bark , but then he saw them scuttling . They were little crablike things , with pincers . They waved little antennae in the air , then headed purposefullyfor the nearest delicacy , Ligeia . " Trouble , " Mym said . " Get your legs up ! " She looked back  --  and screamed . She tried to get her legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first crab reached that foot and took an experimental pinch . Ligeia screamed again . Mym took his paddle and pounded at the crabs with it . Then he jumped  --  one had pinched him on the ankle . It hurt terribly . Then the canoe ran up against a submerged log and stalled . First things first . Mym got to work cleaning out the crabs . He discovered that he could stun them momentarily with a blow , then use the blade of the paddle to lift them up and dump them out . One by one he pursued them , until all were gone . Next , he considered their external predicament . He could not see the log , but he could not move the canoe off it . " I 'll have to get out and lift it off , " he said . " No , no , do n't do that ! " Ligeia protested . " Any part that touches this water  --  the sorrows  --  " He did n't need to have sorrows in his feet , legs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Hell could make things uncomfortably literal . He looked for some other way . " Oh , no ! " Ligeia said . Mym looked . There in the water was an alligator . It looked hungry . Desperately , he paddled , trying to boost the canoe off the hangup , but all he succeeded in doing was to shove his end around until the canoe was sideways , being pushed by the current but not getting anywhere . That gave him a notion . He continued paddling , with a watchful eye on the alligator , until his end swung the rest of the way around . The canoe was now backwards , facing upstream , still stuck . But Mym 's end was beyond the barrier . " Come back here with me , and we can budge it , " he called . Ligeia moved back . As her end lightened , they were at last able  |p230to  shove off the log , just as the alligator closed in . They took off backward , unable to turn around . So Mym stroked backward while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted , but did not pursue . After that , they knew how to get over the submerged logs . They struggled on to the next landing and got out . This time , again , Ligeia remained in the canoe with the snake , letting Mym handle his business alone . Shortly after they resumed their journey , the river widened andjoined a truly horrendous tributary . The water of the other riversmelled of oil , and small blue flames played across its surface . Ligeia pointed to it . " The River Phlegethon , " she said . Mym was appalled . " You mean we have to go up that ? " She nodded . " The next good group ... " So they stroked up the River of Fire . Mym could feel the heat of the flame on it ; when his energetic paddling splashed droplets of water into the canoe , they ignited as they landed . Had the canoe been of wood or bark , it would soon have been ablaze ! As it was , it grew hot , and the snake crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the metal hull . Then they came to rapids , and the vapor thrown up by the spuming liquid was burning , making a curtain of fire extending several meters above the surface . " No way we can go through that , " Mym said . " We 'll have to portage . " They guided the craft to the side , found a reasonably firm section of the bank , and got out . Then they hauled the canoe out and picked up each end . It was heavy and clumsy , seeming much more so than it had when they first put it into the water . This was an indication of how they were tiring . Then their feet started sinking down into the marshy ground . Each time Mym took a step , there was a sucking sound , and muck coated his boots , and an odor reminiscent of overripe eggs wafted up . Ligeia , wearing only delicate slippers , was worse off . " Maybe I can haul it ! " Mym exclaimed . He set down his end , slogged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , reluctantly . He stepped forward and hauled again . It was feasible . This allowed Ligeia to pick her way more carefully , sparing her slippers and feet further degradation . But the marsh got worse . It started making sucking sounds of  |p231its  own , and holes appeared that were not caused by feet . They looked like pursed mouths . Mym accidentally put a foot in one ; it sank in halfway to his knee , and the mouth-hole closed about it and hung on . He wrenched , but the boot remained captive and he was in danger of removing his foot without the boot . Meanwhile there was a kind of hissing and steaming in the hole , as if digestive juices were being squirted about . So he reached with difficulty into the canoe , fetched out a paddle , and used it to jam into the hole and wedge out his boot . It was awkward , clumsy business , hut at last he got it free , somewhat degraded on the outside . He resumed the hauling , now being more careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he labored , and he was sweating , but he made progress . Again he wondered idly about the physiologicaleffects here in the spirit realm ; had he not known where he was , he would have had no way to tell that he was not in the mortal realm . To a spirit , the spirit world seemed just as tangible as the physical world did to a mortal . They came in above the fire-rapids , launched the canoe , and paddled on upstream . In due course they reached the fourth encampmentand made the connection . Then all they had to do was proceed on back down the River of Fire . Dusk was at hand as they reached the foul Acheron again ; instead of entering it , they landed the canoe and made camp at the fringe of the fire zone . There was nothing to drink except some of the firewater , and nothing to eat except tubers they were able to scrounge from the scorched soil . But they stuck the tubers on the ends of long sticks and toasted them at the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyable . The firewater did not properly slacken their thirst , but it soon caused them to cease to worry about the matter . They talked , laughed , rolled together , and decided it was time to get serious about sex . . . and discoveredthey could not . The firewater had not only inflamed their desire , it had made one or the other of them impotent . Ligeia found that hilarious , but Mym suspected that in the morning , when he was sober , he would not be laughing . Unrequited lust  --  trust Hell to be the place for that sort of experience ! Indeed , when the morning came , he was not laughing . His body ached from the exertions of the prior day , and his head felt as if  |p232he  had soaked it overnight in the stench-water of the Acheron . Ligeia seemed little better off ; her beauty was now overlaid by grime and fatigue . " Oh , my clothing ! " she fussed . " No one would take me for a princess now ! " " True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman . " She glanced at him . " Are you making fun of me ? " " No . I never really cared for princesses , but I have known some fine women . " Actually that was a confusion , perhaps spawned by his hangover . He did care for princesses , and needed one to share his life . But at the moment he really craved a woman of the nature of Orb , who had brought him up when he had been low and loved him without questioning his nature . Ligeia was both princess and woman  --  but the woman aspect was becoming more important to him . " Oh . " She considered for a moment . " But do n't you prefer pretty women ? " " Second only to caring ones . " " You are making fun of me ! " " Come read my mind . " He took her hand and drew her in to him . She came , making only token resistance . He phased in to her  --  and discovered a kind of tinder that ignited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a dialogue , occurring in an instant ; parsed into its components it might have been rendered like this : " But I 'm not ready to love ! " she protested . " You do n't need to , " he responded . " I 'm on the rebound . " " This sort of thing is supposed to take time ! " " We 'll give it time . " " Too late ! I 'm already raging with desire ! " " That 's my desire ! " " Not any more ! " They disengaged and looked at each other . " I 'm not sure we should have done that , " Mym said . " I 'm not sure we should be doing this , " she replied . " Be doing what ? " " What we could n't do last night . " She began removing her clothing . Mym realized that they had no secrets from each other . It did make sense to complete what they had started in their minds . On  |p233the  prior night it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they could appreciate it to its full extent with their minds clear . He removed his own clothing . " Afterwards , we can wash up in firewater , " he remarked . That set her off again , laughing . Her whole body jiggled with her mirth . There was a sound from the river . Mym looked up  --  and saw a great fiery shape emerging from the water . " What 's that ? " he asked , alarmed . Ligeia looked . " The Fireman ! " she shrieked . " The what ? " " The denizen of the River of Fire ! I thought he was a myth ! We must flee ! " " I 'll fight him ! " Mym said , getting to his feet . " You ca n't ! " she protested . " He burns everything ! " Mym faced the emerging monster and reached for the Red Sword . But of course the Sword was gone , along with the rest of his clothing . Gone ? He had never brought it into Hell ! He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A jet of flame came from his hand , and the tree burst into fire . The Fireman pointed at the river ; the jet touched it , and the water boiled into a cloud of vapor . The Fireman pointed at Mym . Mym snatched up his cloak and dodged to the side . The ground where he had been standing jumped as if struck by a bomb , and smoke roiled up . " Flee ! " Ligeia cried , terrified . Mym concluded that this was good advice . He grabbed her hand and fled . They ran to the shore of the Acheron , and the Fireman did not pursue them there . He hovered for a moment where they had camped , then marched back into the Phlegethon . When they returned to their campsite , they found only slag and ashes . Their clothing and the canoe had been destroyed . The only other survivor was the snake . They stood there . " Maybe we should n't have , " Ligeia said . " We did n't . " Mym reminded her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the mood was gone . It would have to wait for another time . They resumed their trip , walking carefully in their bare feet . Fortunately , Ligeia said , their next and final stop was not far ahead . They proceeded to the juncture of the rivers and walked along the bank of the Acheron ; in an hour or so came to the merger with the greatest of all Hell 's rivers , the Styx . It was so vast as to seem like an ocean in itself , and its waters were inky black and seemed deep beyond imagination . Out across its somber surface , near the horizon , strange waves developed , as if some massiveand sinister creature swam below . Mym would not have wanted to take a canoe out there ! In another hour they reached the encampment of the final group . There were women here  --  indeed , it seemed to be an Amazoncommunity  --  and they looked at Mym appraisingly , as if judging whether his flesh would be better for soup or for pot roast . But Ligeia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Incarnationof War , and needed to meet with their leader privately . They were impressed , for they were warlike women , and soon Mym was closeted with the head Amazon . He explained in a few words , then phased in with her . " Lovely ! " she exclaimed as they disengaged . " You may count on us . " The Amazons provided them with clothing and a tent to stay in and fed them well . " We shall coordinate the signals , " their leader assured Mym . " Give us a day , while you rest . " Then Mym and Ligeia retired to their tent , at last having the chance to do what they wished without intrusion  --  and found themselves both so tired that they simply flopped on the fragrant straw and slept.  |p235In  the morning things were ready . Mym and Ligeia and the snake emerged from the tent to find the Amazons in full combat dress . Each stood tall and proud with her bow and quiver of arrows , her left breast full and perfectly molded , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , burned off in childhood , so that it never developed and thus could never interfere with the drawing of the bowstring . " But we have two problems , " Diana , the Amazonleader , said . " First , we lack efficient means of travel . Only the demons can use the front routes , and the back routes , as you know , are slow and treacherous . Since it is necessary for you to be at all the key sites  --  " " What is the second problem ? " Mym asked . " There is a demon spy among us . " " Do n't hurt the snake ! " Ligeia exclaimed . " It has done us no harm ! " " Except to report of your whereabouts every night , " Diana said . " We knew its mission , " Mym said . " We saw to it that it did not know our actual plan . " " Still , now that plan must be revealed , and surprise is of the essence . That demon must be abolished . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snake , " Ligeia protested . " The soul of an animal . " " How do you know ? " " It got cold . A demon would not have been affected . " Mym glanced at the snake , startled . It was true ; demons had no vulnerability to extremes of temperature , as they had to functionin all the climes that made souls suffer . Yet , that being the case " It must still be a spy , " Diana said . We must hack it to pieces , so that it can not report on our activity . " " But you ca n't kill a soul , " Mym said . " But we can do the equivalent , " she said . " When we do to it what would be the killing of a mortal , it becomes nonfunctional for a day , just as the demons do . That is all the time we need . " " But we ca n't even be sure it is a spy , " Ligeia said . " It 's just a snake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . Maybe it had no choice . " " I can settle this , " Mym said . " I will phase in to it . " He approached the snake and put his hand on its body . The snake did not try to avoid him . In a moment he knew two things , and one of them astonished him . The snake was a spy for Satan  --  and the snake did not want to be . It had spied because it knew that Satan would have put it into perpetual torture if it did not cooperate . So it had reported each night to a demon who came to meet it . But it wished there were some other choice . When Ligeia had warmed it , it had been grateful to her , for no other creature had shown it such considerationduring its life or its Afterlife . But it had had no way to escape its assignment . But now you have a way , Mym thought to it . Join the revolt . The snake was amazed . You would have me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its precepts . Then I join it . Will other animals join it ? Mym inquired . If they knew they would be accepted and rewarded as the human souls are . Mym disengaged . " The snake will join us , if we will accept it . Other animals may do the same . Do you see what this means ? "  |p237The  animals  --  will join us ? " Diana asked incredulously . " Even the hellhounds ? " " We can but inquire , " Mym said . " It is a risk of betrayal , but if successful  --  " " You are the leader , Mars , " Diana said . " If you are ready to take that risk  --  " " I believe I am . I believe the snake speaks for its kind and perhaps for others . If we offer them the same terms  --  " Diana shrugged . " Then we shall not protest . " Mym phased in to the snake again . He thought the terms to it . Bring those animals who accept this here , he concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mym said . It was a painful process , waiting until the animals responded . But the benefit could be critical . Hours passed . Then two hellhounds bounded toward the camp . The Amazons raised their bows , arrows nocked . Hellhounds were hard to put out of business , because they were so large and tough , but arrows through the eyes and paws could do it . The hellhounds slowed and paused , then walked slowly on toward the group , tracked by the arrowheads . When they reached the center , Mym approached . He touched one and phased in . The animals were willing . They hated Hell as much as the human souls did . Most animals retired at death to their own Afterlives , but some few were caught up in the human system , particularlythose who had been pets or associates of man . They wanted to be free of it just as much as the human souls did . Then we shall include you in the reckoning , on the same basis as the human souls , Mym thought to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I , the representative of the animals , accept this , the hellhound thought back . How may we serve you ? We require transportation . We can provide it . So the pact was made . The two hellhounds loped away . In an hour , two wild horses galloped in . Their dark manes flung out and their nostrils snorted steam ; they were killer equines , damned for killing men . But for this they were tame . Ligeia , being a princess , knew how to ride well . She and Mymp238mounted . " You know what to do , " Mym called to Diana as they rode away . The horses galloped to the nearest ford and crossed the Acheron . People afoot would not have been able to do it , because of the foulness of the water , but these horses were toughened to it . Then they carried Mym and Ligeia to the checkpoint of their region of Hell . This was simply a guard station at the intersection of several paved roads . A demon guard stood there , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to pass this point would get burned . Spiked fences extended from the checkpoint away across the terrain , and Mym knew that those would not be subject to passing , either ; Hell surely had ways to make a fence tight . The only interruption of such a fence would be a river , which explained how the canoe had gotten them through . They rode up on the wild horses and dismounted . The demon 's gaze followed them , and its flamethrower was ready . Mym took a step toward the checkpoint , then seemed to hesitate . " I do n't think we can go this way , " he said to Ligeia . " Oh , and I did so want to be alone with you , " she said , speaking the line they had rehearsed . They started to turn away . " Halt ! " the demon cried . They paused . The thing had taken the bait ! " Oh , do n't let that demon get me ! " Ligeia cried . " Where were you going ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not wholly feigned . " I just  --  nowhere , " she said , trembling . The demon 's red eyes glowed more brightly as he surveyed her body . Drool dribbled from a tusk . Demons might be incapable of such human emotions as love , but they could compass lust , and Ligeia 's figure incited that . " You can be alone with me , wench , and I do n't care who watches ! " " No ! " she cried . The demon aimed the flamethrower . " Come here , wench  --  or fry ! " Reluctantly , Ligeia approached the demon . Then , just as it was about to grab her , she screamed . The demon dropped like a clod of manure . Mym hurried in and hauled it out of the box . Then he took the flamethrower and fired  |p239it  , playing the flame over the demon 's body . Foul smoke went up as the body burned and vaporized . In a moment , nothing was left . Mym waved his arm in a signal across the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the checkpoint . A demon was coming down the road , evidently off duty from some mission of malice . " Hey , get back to work , you sluts ! " it cried . But the Amazons charged right at it and , in a moment , had overwhelmed it and hacked it to pieces . The revolt was on ! Diana arrived at the checkpoint . " Take over , " Mym told her , presenting the flamethrower . " No demon shall pass , Mars ! " she said , thumping her chest on the flat right side with her fist . " We 'll mop up those remaining in this sector , never fear ! " They led the wild horses through , and Mym and Ligeia remountedon the other side of the checkpoint . They galloped toward the next one . Mym was pleased . This first mission had gone smoothly , and the upper echelon of Hell had not been warned . If they could take out the other four as readily , the revolt would succeed before Satan even knew it was in progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sought . Heknew there was none . He had acquainted the leaders of the majorsections with his plan for an organized rebellion , occurring virtuallysimultaneously in several regions , so that the demonicforces would be unable to concentrate on any one . There were athousand damned souls for every demon , and only the tight organizationand repressive tactics of the demons kept the soulscowed . As long as the major sections of Hell were sealed off fromeach other , no revolt could succeed , because the demons wouldwipe it out by concentrating their force . The other sections wouldbe unable to assist , if they even knew what was going on . Then , of course , there would be a brutal extra ration of torture for allthose who had participated in the uprising . The thing about torturein Hell was that there was no necessary end to it ; what wouldcause a mortal to die in agony merely caused the agony here . Those who did the equivalent of dying woke again the following day , for a resumption of the torture . And the demons were adeptat easing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasp240no period of unconsciousness . No , it really was n't worth it , makingtrouble in Hell ! Of course they could not come at the next checkpoint from the central road ; the demons would know immediately that two souls mounted on wild horses did not belong there . They had to cross at the rear and approach from inside . This checkpoint had merely gotten them into the region of fire ; it had not given them freedom of Hell 's highways . But since they did not have to follow the devious river channel , they did gain time . The wild horses , out of their territory , were not familiar with this region , but Ligeia had enough of a notion of it to guide them . They skirted the worst of the blazes and found the camp of the damned souls of this region . " It 's on ! " Mym called as they gallopedthrough . " Prepare the ambush ! The Amazons are in control of their sector ! " There was immediately activity in the camp , as the souls moved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their job , as would the Amazons . In due course they emerged from a region of smoldering grass to come in sight of the checkpoint . Here the demon had a firehose , for a flamethrower would hardly stop those who were acclimatizedto fire . The water that the hose would squirt was poisonous and would cause any flesh it touched to die and rot . This was just as effective in its fashion as the flamethrower at the other site . At this station there were two female demons . The vulnerablegirlploy would not work here ; demonesses were no less lustful than the males , but their tastes differed . So for this one Mym made himself invisible and walked up alone . He carried a sharp knife that the Amazons had given him , fashioned from a fragment of bone . Again he wondered how there could be bones where there was no mortal flesh and no true dying ; he could only conjecturethat Hell was stocked with all manner of repulsive things , including bones . His foot struck a pebble , and the nearer demoness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped at her and cut her throat before she could speak . Mistake ! The slash drew no blood . The mouth screamed warningto the other . Mym hacked away at the rest of the neck , severingthe head more readily than he would a human head , forp241demons possessed no bones . But the severed head continued to scream , even as it rolled on the ground , and the arms flailed at him . The other demoness caught up the water hose and turned on the water . She swept it in an arc , to catch whatever was there . The blast of it caught Mym dead center and knocked him back . But he retained his invisibility . Because he was an Incarnation , he was immune to the poison . He grabbed the decapitated demoness , used her as a shield , and advanced on the other . Demons were not noted for spooking , but this sight of her beheadedcompanion advancing purposefully on her caused this one to stare . Then she dived for the alarm signal , to summon help . Mym let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not see him , but now she could feel him and she fought savagely , scratching at him with her claws and biting at him with her teeth . Tusks were just as dangerous on a female as on a male , but his cloak protected him from injury . He got her down and held her there . " Firefolk ! " he yelled . " Here to me ! " In a moment the damned souls closed in and quickly tore apart both the whole and the partial demoness . Another sector had been liberated . They mounted the wild steeds again and headed for the next . So far there was no general alarm in Hell  --  but that last had been close . They proceeded to the next checkpoint . This one had a male and a female demon . Mym and Ligeia approached them together , but before they got close enough to act , the male did a doubletake . " Hey , did n't I see you at the mesa ? " it demanded . " You were  --  " Mym charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not before the female had struck the alarm button . Then Mym dispatched her , and the damned souls took over the checkpoint . But the damage had been done . The alarm had been sounded , and now the demons would be alert . Three sectors in rebel hands were not enough ; they needed five , by Mym 's judgment . Five would stretch the demon forces out thin enough to resist ; four was doubtful , and three insufficient . " But maybe if we strike where unexpected , " Mym said . They entered the sector of perpetual snows . The demons knew
