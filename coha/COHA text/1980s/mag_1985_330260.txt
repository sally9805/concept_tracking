All over America last week media wits were weighing in with the heavy jokes . Well , it was kind of amusing , from a limited Occidental view , to see Secretary of State George Shultz , no sylph himself , standing between two near naked sumo wrestlers from Japan in the federal drawing room at the State Department . The grapplers were in the U.S. for the first sanctioned sumo match abroad , in the hopes of winning new friends for Japan and the sport . Shultz , who was filling in at the last minute for the President , gamely turned to 268- lb . Grand Champion Chiyonofuji , 30 , and 491-lb . Konishiki , 21 , and said , " Welcome to our country . " Replied Konishiki : " Hey , thanks , but I 'm an American . " Born Salevaa Atisnoe in Hawaii , the quarter-tonner stands on the edge of becoming a sekiwake , the sport 's third highest rank , something no American has ever achieved . Hulk Hogan , eat your heart out .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
