SOMEONE ELSE 'S MONEY <P> by Michael M. Thomas <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 511 pages ; $14.95 <P> The worlds of art and high finance have sometimes seemed inseparable over the past two decades . If the dogged substitution of price for quality has defied good sense and good taste , fiction has been a major beneficiary . Yale-educated Michael Thomas , who at 46 has had successful careers in both milieus ( the Metropolitan Museum of Art , Lehman Brothers ) , has distilled from the darker lunacies of these worlds a novel of crackling humor and mordant observation . Its bigger-than-Barron ' s protagonist is Oilman Buford ( " Bubber " ) Gudge IV , who has been content to nurse his multibillion-dollar fortune in the Texas Panhandle until lust and vengeance propel him forth like a plague of pissants . <P> Gudge has two serious problems : he is dying of cancer and he is totally at the mercy of his new wife Caryn , a dexterous Texas tart who has decided that she wants nothing less from Bubber than the most dazzling collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures are not for sale .

Granada aims to buy her way to social acceptance via the stock market and art patronage , and Thomas ' depiction of the scramble of ars gratia ego is both deeply knowledgeable and unnerving . <P> If the novel has a hero , it is Nicholas Reverey , an honorable , fortyish art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Carritt 's . The love interest is provided by Jill Newman , who manages to churn out gossip for a rag called That Woman ! as well as an authoritative column for a financial weekly . As in his first novel , Green Monday , Thomas has assembled a picaresque cast of cutthroats , poseurs , cultural pimps and likable rascals . But the author 's true love is for art , the canvases , the places and the people , of which he writes at times with the clarity and luster of a Rubens ... or the school of . <P> <P> BACK TO BASICS <P> by Burton Yale Pines <P> Morrow ; 348 pages ; $13.50
