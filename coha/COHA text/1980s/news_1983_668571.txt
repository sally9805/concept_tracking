By 11:30 in the morning , the young ladies were stretching their bodies at the huge statue of orator Edward Everett Hale on the Common , one leg up on his pedestal , only feet away from the starting line on Charles street . Hale , shoulders slouched and cane in hand , looked down grumpily on the scene and said nothing . It was not his day ; it was theirs . The women were everywhere . Women in mysterious sweatshirts ( " Exponent II is X " ; " Do I Dare Disturb the Universe ? " ) , women in common T-shirts ( " Boston " ) and women in running shirts ( " Greater Boston Track Club , " " Irish-American Track Club " and " Bonne Bell East Coast Running Team " ) . There were shirts from the beach ( " Awesome " ) and shirts with a statement ( " Nothing But the Best " ) but there was only one shirt with a " 1 " on it . And it was nowhere to be seen . The flat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Finch Pub at the Hampshire House on Beacon street , down past Mt . Vernon and Pinckney streets , and all the way back through the Common to Boylston street . Over 7500 women were there , but the most important one was nowhere to be seen , spicing a beautiful day with beautiful drama . It was 11:30 a.m. , just a half-hour from the start of the seventh Bonne Bell 10K road race , and Joan Benoit had already run a couple of miles through Brookline and now had parked her car at the Eliot Lounge on Massachusetts ave . At that very moment , one of the world ' s top women distance runners was quietly and anonymously jogging the mile or so down Commonwealth ave . to the starting line . Say the woman has style . Nobody knew this , of course . For all anybody knew , Joan Benoit was back home in Freeport , Maine , down the road from L.L. Bean but 120 miles from Boston . And such was the talk at the starting line , as all the women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - were placed in line . " I hear she ' s not coming . " " I don ' t know . " And then , like a phantom , Joan Benoit dropped onto the starting line just before the wheelchair athletes began rolling down Charles street . One moment she was in Freeport , Maine , and the next she was at the front of the pack on Boston Common . One moment there was going to be a race and the next moment the race was called off . Instead , a Columbus Day parade with Joan Benoit leading the way . The decision to run the Bonne Bell had been put off to the last moment . " Mentally , I ' m very tired , " said Benoit , and as late as Sunday evening , she was not sure she was coming to Boston . Besides , there was homecoming weekend at Bowdoin and Benoit had plans for the alumni field hockey game . " In order to get to the campus , " she said matter of factly , " I had to runfrom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I ran that in the morning and then I played in the field hockey game . " How was the game ? " I stayed out of the thick of things , " she said with a wide smile . " I didn ' t want to get bashed in the shins . " After the field hockey game at Bowdoin , and after the 14 or 15 miles back home , Benoit was leery of her muscles tightening on her . " So I went for another little run ( Sunday ) night . " And how big was the little run ? " Oh , about four miles . " It was after that little run that she got into the car and drove nearly three hours to a friend ' s house in Brookline . Her body was fine , even if her mental edge was not , and besides , the Bonne Bell is a race she enjoys . " Boston is very special to me , " she explained . " I mean , it ' s an all- woman ' s race and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it my best shot . It ' s a neat race . " So it was over , so neatly and so wondrously , an American record and a course record at the tag end of such a weekend . The most difficult facet of competition for this woman with the Down East demeanor is the game of Meet The Press that is played after the race " because trying to give time to everybody is exhausting . I mean , I think it ' s important that I make the rounds and see as many people as I can but it is exhausting . " The time limit for the press conference was past and an official called a halt . One last question , Benoit was asked : " Who won the field hockey game ? " " Oh , we lost , " she laughed . " Two to zero . " See , Joan Benoit is not a super woman . . . only the closest relation .                   @ @
