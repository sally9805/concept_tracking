If it happens , consumers might not see much lower gasoline or home-heating prices . Instead , many governments , including the United States , are expected to consider imposing a new tax on imported oil - to keep prices level , dampening consumer demand for oil and raising government revenues. // Even if the official price of OPEC ( Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ) drops , Iran , Libya , and Venezuela may keep on selling oil at a discount as they are now and ignore OPEC quotas , perhaps triggering a price war that could drive prices down even further. // Echoing widespread concern about a possible price drop , the chairman of British Petroleum , Peter Walters , said Thursday that any reduction in Vienna could set off a downward spiral that would endanger the world financial system. // If OPEC nations lower their prices , the argument goes , they have less money to put into international banks , and the banks would have less money to lend to developing countries with high debts . If just one developing nation defaults on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eroded . The world would face a ' ' liquidity crunch. ' ' // At the same time , developing countries that are oil-producing nations , either in or outside of OPEC , would also find their oil assets worth much less and face a financial crisis. // Sources close to Arab officials in the Gulf say Gulf states threatened a drop on the order of $4 in meetings here and in the Mideast on the eve of the OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna Dec. 19. // The hope of Saudi Arabia was that the threat itself was enough to bring OPEC ' ' rogue elephant ' ' members such as Iran , Libya , and Venezuela back into line with the current official price of $34 a barrel. // All three ' ' rogues ' ' need cash urgently in a buyers market . All are producing well above OPEC production quotas set last March , and are selling at substantial discounts in a variety of ways. // The threat may work , sources predict , but most feel that Vienna will see more disarray in OPEC , not less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue as world demand remains low. // OPEC , the argument goes , faces the biggest-ever threat to its existence . And a $4 drop , taking the basic price for Arabian light crude oil down to $30 a barrel , would be Saudi Arabia ' s way of trying to reimpose OPEC unity and cohesion. // The decision could be taken at the next OPEC meeting , or at a session of the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) soon after the Vienna session . The council is made up of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates , Oman , Bahrain , and Qatar. // Saudi Arabia ' s oil minister , Ahmad Zaki Yamani , supported by Kuwait and other moderate Gulf states , is reported to prefer to protect the $34 price if possible , but to be ready to cut at least $4 , if necessary , to make OPEC oil more attractive. // Mr. Yamani is also being pressed to lower the Saudi base price by the four major oil companies in Aramco , which are losing money by paying Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as $26. // ' ' The one way OPEC can regain more of the world market share for oil is to sell more cheaply , ' ' says a veteran industry source just back in London after visiting the Gulf. // ' ' OPEC simply can ' t keep the $34 mark when demand is so flat . It ' s going to stay flat next year . Yamani agreed to go up from $32 to $34 earlier this year to keep OPEC unity . Well , there ' s no unity now. ' ' // An experienced nonindustry observer of the oil scene for many years agrees . ' ' Four dollars , I think , ' ' he predicted after talks with senior Arab oil officials. // The conventional wisdom is that there is a world oil glut , and that it is expected to continue until 1984 or later . A dissenting view comes from the 21-nation consumer watchdog in Paris called the International Energy Agency , which argues that the glut is an illusion caused by a rundown of stocks . By the end of this decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will recur. // Industry sources reply by pointing to new oil indications off California and China . They say oil reserves will be abundant for many years to come . They agree that world demand will pick up when recession eases , but make two further points : // // * Demand will rise slowly because many people have insulated their homes and bought small cars , and many computers are in place , using less energy than big factories. // // * If OPEC survives , or is replaced by a Gulf-state group , it will not repeat the experience of the 1970s and let prices jump too fast. // Today , prices have come down on spot markets to as low as $26 to $28 a barrel for Arabian crude . OPEC rebels are trying to cash in , and non-OPEC states , such as Britain and Norway , are being forced to keep their own prices low to compete. // A number of sources agree that a $4 OPEC drop would simply force Libya , Iran , and Venezuela to lower their own discounted oil to as low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we then had a free falling price and a price war , ' ' comments one source , ' ' all kinds of implications follow , none of them good. ' ' // There is a degree of unity on what those implications may be . From sources as diverse as pro-OPEC Mideast specialist Robert Mabro of St. Antony ' s College , Oxford , and Michael Roeskau of the IEA in Paris come this listing : // // * The world banking system would be faced with less OPEC money to lend to debt-ridden developing nations. // // * Consumer nations would be tempted even more to relax efforts to conserve energy , concentrate on coal , and develop synfuels and nuclear energy . Falling prices already make many synfuels projects uneconomic. // // * New financial difficulties would lie ahead for other non-OPEC states such as Britain and Norway , whose oil revenues would drop at a time of deep recession. // Oxford ' s Mr. Mabro and other sources see Vienna as paving the way for yet another OPEC meeting next year , which could then see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna will be followed within a week by a meeting of the GCC . That meeting would decide to lower the standard price to $30. // The IEA sees world consumption back up to 50 million barrels per day or 56 bpd if economic growth is higher . Current world consumption is around 45 million bpd. // //
