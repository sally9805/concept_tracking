As rebels keep up the pressure , Arafat searches for support <P> With its clean palm-lined boulevards and whitewashed houses , the capital of Tunisia is far , both in spirit and geography , from the fratricidal politics of the Middle East . Nonetheless , Tunis was the scene last week of a series of meetings that were being watched closely by leaders throughout the Arab world . Shuttling between a sumptuous seaside villa and an elegant resort hotel were Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat , who only a week earlier had been unceremoniously declared persona non grata in Syria , and key members of the P.L.O . ' s powerful Executive Committee . At stake was the future of Arafat 's leadership and of the organization that he has transformed from a loose and ineffectual association into a powerful force for Palestinian nationalism . <P> In keeping with the mood , the men met not amid the gilded furniture of the villa 's main floor but in a sparse , well-protected basement room with a solitary window . There , around a plain Formica-topped table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plight of several thousand commandos loyal to Fatah , the Arafat-led group that accounts for 80% of the P.L.O . ' s membership , who were trapped in Lebanon 's Bekaa Valley . For the past two months , a faction of Fatah guerrillas opposed to Arafat 's leadership had , with the backing of Syrian armor , gradually pushed the loyalists from their positions eastward across the valley . The fighting threatened to spread to the town of Baalbek , where some 10,000 Palestinian civilians live . Beyond the immediate military crisis loomed the larger issue of whether the P.L.O . could retain its independence in the face of Syrian President Hafez Assad 's determined bid to make the organization subservient to Syrian interests . <P> Wearing his jaunty army cap , Arafat seemed surprisingly relaxed . He joked and smiled as the Executive Committee got down to the hard task of determining what to do in the face of Syria 's challenge . By week 's end the committee had decided to send a six-man delegation to Syria to hold talks with Assad and the Fatah rebels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal cease-fire had been arranged in the Bekaa . That agreement called for all guerrilla forces on both sides to withdraw from the area around the Beirut-Damascus highway and to release their respective prisoners . Said P.L.O . Spokesman Abdel Mohsen Abu Maizer , in Tunis : " We will not destroy each other . Our main enemy remains those who deny our national rights . " At week 's end , however , the truce broke down amid sporadic fighting . Observed a participant in the Tunis talks : " According to Arab tradition , we can have confrontation and then reconciliation , but I do n't believe we can this time . " <P> Meanwhile the Saudis and the Algerians also tried to heal the breach . Late last week a joint Saudi-Algerian delegation went to Damascus and reportedly urged that a summit be convened to bring Arafat and Assad together .
