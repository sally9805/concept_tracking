Next , Mayor Jane Byrne had to lock labor negotiators behind closed doors until they agreed on a contract to end a two-week teachers ' strike . Then , on Valentine 's Day , almost all the city 's 4,300 fire fighters struck . <P> But what really burned Her Honor was a picture taken last summer by her official photographer , Martha Leonard . It shows the mayor and her daughter Kathy , 22 , mugging as gangsters ' molls with Comedians John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd , who were in Chicago to film the movie The Blues Brothers .
