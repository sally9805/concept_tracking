A new breed of banker is turning up on college campuses . Barely old enough to take out loans , much less authorize them , undergraduate financiers have established federally insured credit unions at twelve schools , from Berkeley to Babson College in Wellesley , Mass . Estimated combined assets so far : $10 million . The University of Colorado at Boulder will open one in June . <P> Some of the operations offer just savings and checking accounts and personal loans , but others are more sophisticated . Through Connecticut Bank &; Trust , for example , the 2,500 members of the University of Connecticut credit union can use electronicbanking cards to withdraw money at any of the bank 's 196 cash machines . At Georgetown , the campus credit union is making tuition loans of up to $6,500.
