NEW YORK  --  General Electric Co. reported a 14% increase in first-quarter earnings on an 8% rise in sales . Separately , its information-services unit announced a new nationwide information network for computer-data communications . GE said the earnings gain reflected gains in appliances , lighting , aircraft engines , nuclear power services and its finance unit . GE ' s chairman , John F. Welch Jr. , said sales gains " continued to be led by solid increases in consumer-driven markets , particularly engineered plastics , major appliances , video products , and housewares and audio products . " First-quarter net income rose to $485 million , or $1. 07 a share , from $425 million , or 93 cents a share , a year earlier . Sales increased to $6. 58 billion from $6. 1 billion . GE said the improvements were offset by a $46 million pre-tax reserve for " future business restructurings , " continued weakness in Mexico and Venezuela operations because of the depressed Latin American economies , and lower earnings from " longer-cycle businesses , such as locomotives and turbines .

Earnings at GE ' s General Electric Credit Corp. unit rose 34% , reflecting a gain on its $600 million sale in February of its second mortgage unit , Family Financial Services , to the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society . In a separate announcement , General Electric Information Services Co. said it reduced charges 21% to 56% for its electronic-mail service known as Quik-Comm and announced a joint agreement with Wang Laboratories Inc. for delivering electronic messages to Wang Professional Computers . The new network , called Mark*Net , was adopted from a world-wide computer-communications system used internally by GE for about 15 years . Coupled with the lower-priced electronic-mail service , it places GE squarely in the middle of the fight for the next big market in high-technology : networks of widely varied computers that can exchange memos , files , software programs and , eventually , spoken messages and pictures of documents . The move pits GE against Tymshare Inc. ' s Tymnet , GTE Corp. ' s Telenet , MCI Communications Inc. ' s electronic mail service , and expected information networks from International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executives of the GE unit didn ' t specify how soon the venture would be profitable . The GE unit will spend more than $200 million this year on engineering , informationprocessing and communications technology . The new services mark a change in direction away from the older , slow-growth market for rented computer data-processing time and toward the faster-growing market in communications networks . The information services unit last year provided less than 4% of GE ' s total revenue of $27. 68 billion , a spokesman said . According to an estimate by International Data Corp. , an industry consultant , the overall market for electronic mail , which is carried on communcations networks , will roughly double this year to $160 million in revenues and will reach $850 million by 1987 . The market for communications networks  --  known as packet-switching services because data is transmitted in small bursts , or packets , of information  --  totaled about $195 million in 1982 and will grow to $875 million by 1987 , the consultant predicts . The GE network covers 600 cities in the U.S. and will allow businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information from computer to computer without having to go through complicated format changes when the computers aren ' t compatible , executives said . The GE information unit also introduced a software program for the IBM Personal Computer to be used for electronic mail ; a similar program for Wang computers is planned .
