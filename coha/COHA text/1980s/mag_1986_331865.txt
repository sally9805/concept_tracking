" If we run out of Tabasco , this rig shuts down , " Faye Cleckler tells a luncheon guest who is being shown through her well-stocked pantry aboard the Key Manhattan . No , Cleckler has not found a way to use the fiery Louisiana hot sauce to keep heavy drilling equipment functioning  --  only the men who handle the gear . She was just pointing out that for those who work on offshore oil rigs , few things are more important than food-as-they-like-it . <P> Home to a crew of about 60 , the Key Manhattan operates in the blue-gray waters of the Gulf of Mexico . The crew members are latter-day lake dwellers who alternate two-week tours of twelve-hour shifts with two weeks at home . Cleckler , 57 , the food manager , finds cooking more rewarding aboard the rig than it is when she prepares meals back home in Brooklyn , Miss. , for her grandchildren , who say McDonald 's food is better . Says Cleckler , one of the eight women aboard who do the housekeeping and cooking : " Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a big-city food critic thinks of it . " <P> The offer to sample the cuisine on an offshore rig was the sort of thing no self-respecting food buff could refuse . " We hear you 're interested in good food , " ran the letter from executives of Keydril , the Houston-based company that contracts , staffs and operates ten exploration drilling rigs for oil companies around the world . " Come and have lunch with us . We think you 'll be surprised . " To an intrepid eater who had tried to get aboard a rig for years , the invitation was irresistible , because food on offshore rigs is legendary for both quantity and quality . Meals have long been considered the prime entertainment for men who are marooned for weeks at a time away from land and family , doing work that is potentially hazardous . Even with television , mail and the possibility of phone calls to shore , tensions inevitably build with men who sleep four bunks to a small , unadorned cabin . <P> " Lunch is ready now , " Cleckler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the hot haze of sea and sky , followed by a landing on what looked like a tiny round tray suspended over an endless expanse of water , the big-city food critic was more than ready for a restorative meal . What she was not ready for was the dazzling variety of Cajun and Southern specialties , impeccably garnished and laid out cafeteria-style in a cheerful yellow-and-spring-green dining room . That bright lime green is the Keydril trademark . The company rigs are painted in that color to give them a clean look from shore and thus not offend environmentalists . Lime green is also the shade for uniforms that all personnel must wear after coming off the drilling floor . No one in work clothes is permitted in the living quarters ; that is not a standard drilling-rig custom but rather a Keydril requirement  --  one that , like having women aboard , is considered a civilizing and softening touch . <P> " Women are mothering and caring , and they do a better job on food , " says Mike Riordan , a motorman from Florida . Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees . " The men appreciate being able to chat with women and hear female voices , and the atmosphere is more relaxed and so safer , " he says . What the women appreciate is earning up to $19,000 for six months ' work , which permits them to hold other jobs at home , to spend solid time with families or simply to vacation .
