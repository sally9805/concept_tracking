Lopold Sdar Senghor , 77 , the former President of Senegal ( 1960-80 ) , is a poet , a philosopher and one of Africa 's most respected elder statesmen . He is among the few Africans ever nominated for a Nobel Prize , and last year was elected to the prestigious French Academy for his contributions to politics and literature . Senghor is also a member of an even more exclusive group : he is one of three African leaders who have relinquished power voluntarily. * In an interview with TIME Correspondent John Borrell in Dakar , he discussed Africa 's past and how it has shaped the present . <P> On Independence . In the 1950s and 1960s it was natural to be romantic and believe that independence would solve all our problems . Then we were too optimistic ; now we often tend to be too pessimistic . In reality , the colonizing powers did not prepare us for independence . Today we need to think methodically and formulate an economic and social development plan on both the worldwide and national levels . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am not discouraged . We have started a dialogue with the rest of the world . We need each other , and we can complement one another . We are beginning to make progress through associations like the one that links the European Community with more than 60 African , Asian and Pacific countries . Perhaps more needs to be done in the future about population growth . For us it is not an easy problem to solve . We love large families . But some progress is being made . <P> <P> On East-West Tensions . As long as France and Britain had colonial empires , the cold war between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. could not be waged here . Since then , the struggle between capitalism and Marxism has been transferred to Africa . Mostly it is the Soviet Union 's fault . Its most dynamic representative is Libya 's Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , who is responsible for a lot of the trouble in many parts of Africa . <P> On Human Rights Abuses . One should not look at the problem in racial terms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let us take South America . The majority of the population is white , and yet South America , be it politically or economically , is hardly more advanced than we are . There are dictatorships in South America , and the prisons are full . <P> <P> On Coups . They are the result of the perversion of the colonial system , which encouraged us to keep the personality cult and the spirit of dictatorship . That was the nature of colonial power . The frequency of coups in Africa is the result of the backwardness in civilization that colonization represented . There are indeed many , many dictatorships . But there are exceptions : look at the Ivory Coast and Cameroon , just to name two . I am concerned about the frequency of coups . We are too docile , allowing ourselves to be influenced by the Americans , the Soviets or even the French and the British . What we should all be fighting for is democratic socialism . And the first task of socialism is not to create social justice . It is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former President Ahmadou Ahidjo of Cameroon and Nigeria 's former military leader , General Olusegun Obasanjo.
