" At the 1981 Inaugural , " Ronald Walker remembered , " I was one of the people who had fire marshals shut the doors in their faces at the Shoreham Hotel . " More people had shown up for the Inaugural Ball there than the fire laws allowed ; the result was disaster . This year Mr. Walker himself is running the Inauguration festivities . Crises have already developed : Unions have protested the wording of a want ad ; the press does not like its seats at the swearing-in . Some political aficionados are very interested in how Mr. Walker copes . In civilian life , you see , he is a mild-mannered senior partner and managing director of the executive search firm of Korn/Ferry . But one quick change in the phone booth and he emerges as his better-known self : Ron Walker , producer of the 1984 Republican convention and one of the country ' s great advance men . Advance men are the roustabouts of the American political circus , the ones who manage the details of pulling the people into the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who always deliver . Mr. Walker thinks life groomed him for this calling from youth . Not that he came from a political family ; instead , his father was an international-aid executive who moved family headquarters from Texas to India to Iran to Lebanon . Mr. Walker says he got his first taste of advancing as a teen-ager , when he had to get himself from his parents ' home in central India to his new school at the southern tip of the continent . He used plane , rickshaw , train and bus , with plentiful opportunities for chaos at each stage , and to this day retains the image of advance work as a kind of foraging for support in an alien environment . He did not consider himself political until the day in 1968 when an acquaintance phoned and asked him to fly to Portland , Ore. , to meet up with the Nixon presidential campaign and consider helping to advance it . By the time he left Portland he had done his first balloon drop and was hooked . At that time , advancing was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960 , advance men started to become less anonymous and more self-conscious about their trade . But they were still likely to be a candidate ' s cronies and part-time election strategists . Along with their love of politics , an egregious few had an unfortunate tendency to leave a trail strewn with unpaid bills and rental cars abandoned in strange places . Other , better-bred types , who considered themselves the serious thinkers of political campaigns , could still try to cut an individual up by deriding him as a " balloon man . " After the 1968 election , President Nixon ' s chief of staff , Bob Haldeman , took actions that helped change this . He set up an advance office in the White House to organize , for the first time , not campaigns but international travel by the president himself . Mr. Walker was put in charge of the new unit . " You don ' t need to be political strategists , " Mr. Haldeman told him . The managerial spirit began to infuse the office . Mr. Walker set up schools for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Office Building . He started " grading " their performances on the road . He wrote a manual . One of those he trained , Michael Raoul-Duval , remembers the ethos that came to pervade the place : " ' Get the job done . ' We never said , ' I can ' t get there . ' " The high point for the new crew came when they advanced the Nixon trip to China in 1972 : " We had no communications there , no infrastructure . Every piece of protocol had to be negotiated without precedents . We had to get a satellite orbited and ground stations set up . We showed them we were tough and disciplined , and this was in its own way as important to the meeting of the two peoples as the Shanghai communique itself . " Mr. Duval later became special counsel to the president , handling economic and intelligence matters , and is now president of First Boston Real Estate &; Development Corp . Despite the usual variations in such matters , advance work has been overtaken by a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics has not disappeared into some technocratic vacuum . Mr. Walker certainly wants to make the Inaugural work this year ( " This time we ' ve taken the fire marshals ' figures for the Inaugural balls and cut them by 20% " ) , but here is how he talks about his more-central goals : " When a couple outside Washington accepts an invitation to the Inaugural , they ' re going to spend a lot of money . They ought to receive their tickets as rapidly as is humanly possible : We ' re using registered mail and an overnight courier service . We ' ve put the tickets in a nice folder ; it ' s tangible , like a passport overseas . We ' re going to help them with ground transport , hotels , advice on the sights and what clothes to wear . " The decorations at the different balls are going to be the same . The shows are going to be more or less the same . The closing ceremonies will be the same . We want people to be able to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be accessible only to an elite . But we ' ve really tried . " Such a spirit is not likely to produce the very most stylish events . But it includes a special and concrete concern for the nonfamous people all over the country who participate in politics , who must be pulled into the tent , and who deserve to be kept happy and smiling there while the rest of America watches on TV . When you think about it , maybe this is not such a bad set of attitudes for the way the country ' s public celebrations should be run.
