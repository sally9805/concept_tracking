In Hong Kong it is known as the princely hong , or trading house , and its leader is the taipan , the big boss . Throughout most of its 156-year history , Jardine Matheson &; Co. has been the foremost trader in the colony , and as readers of Novelist James Clavell know , it has been run not so much by a series of executives as by a dynasty of merchant-rulers . Now the succession has taken its strangest turn . Instead of drawing from the small Scottish knot of the founders ' families , Jardine Matheson has announced that Brian Powers , 38 , a former New York investment banker , will become its first American taipan . <P> The company that Powers will take over in June is like few others . In an era when most multinational firms have given up their old conglomerating ways , Jardines retains a panoply of seemingly unconnected businesses . With 76,000 employees in 22 countries , the company operates the eighth largest insurance brokerage in the world , a sizable construction firm , an investment bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco to Bangkok . Its Hong Kong operations range from the local Mercedes dealership to Mrs. Fields Cookies franchises . But the core of the company 's holdings is $3.2 billion worth of real estate in Hong Kong 's central business district  --  fully 65% of the office and commercial space in the area . <P> However valuable its assets , Jardines has been surpassed in size by two other Hong Kong trading firms  --  Cheung Kong and Swire  --  and has only recently begun to escape from a typhoon of troubles . The company bought or built many of its Hong Kong buildings in the early 1980s , just before real estate values in the colony took a dive . The collapse resulted in part from nervousness about the approach of 1997 , when sovereignty over Hong Kong will pass from Britain to China . Wary of that transfer 's consequences , Jardines decided in 1984 to shift its legal headquarters to Bermuda  --  a move that stirred lingering resentment in Hong Kong . <P> The turbulence of the times may have prompted Jardines to turn to a hyperfast-tracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.Y. , Powers graduated from Yale , where he played football , and got a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1974 . He began his career with the blue- chip Manhattan law firm of Debevoise &; Plimpton , then worked as a money manager for the Ford Foundation and as an investment banker for James D. Wolfensohn Inc . At Wolfensohn , Powers put together several deals for Simon Keswick , the outgoing taipan . <P> Keswick ( pronounced keh-zik ) , the seventh taipan of that name to run Jardines since its founding in 1832 , was impressed , and persuaded Powers to join the company in 1986 as chief strategist . Powers helped engineer a ! restructuring that reduced the firm 's debt load and bolstered its earnings . The company 's profits surged 64% in 1987 , to a record $100.4 million . <P> Powers has the boldness to keep building Jardines . Says he : " I think you can manage a conglomerate just fine , if you 've got it structured just right . " And he has absorbed a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declares , " We do n't care what industry it 's in , as long as it 's a good buy . " To keep its far-flung empire flourishing , Jardines may have picked just the right taipan for the job .
