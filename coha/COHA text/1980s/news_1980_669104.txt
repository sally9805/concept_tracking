He ' s like a grand skyscraper , and everything about him , from the boundless sense of power he conveys as he strides up to the plate to his ability to send a baseball skyrocketing over the outfield wall , is overwhelming. // It is no wonder that Yankee owner George Steinbrenner considers Jackson the key element behind the success of his organization . After all , the slugging outfielder does what every successful corporation man must do : He produces ! Steinbrenner says , " Reggie is just about the only man in baseball who can carry a team for a month. " // Since joining the Yankees in 1977 , Jackson has continued to enhance the reputation he built during his years in Oakland as a slugger and team leader . But the man who antagonized his new teammates three years ago with his big ego and his famour remark that " I ' m the straw that stirs the drink " seems to have mellowed and matured off the field this season . In fact , he goes out of his way these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success. // " We ' ve got many leaders on this team , " he said after helping the Yankees to a four-game sweep in Boston last weekend that just about wrapped up their fourth American League East title in the last five years . " There ' s Ron Guidry , Willie Randolph , Goose Gossage , Graig Nettles. . . . " // Yet Reggie provides leadership in his own distinctive manner via the long ball . In his three previous years with the Yankees he averaged nearly 30 home runs and 100 RBIs per season  --  and this summer he ' s been even more torrid than before . His batting average has hovered around . 300 for most of the season , and he has also managed to clout 37 home runs and drive in 98 runs so far. // Bob Watson , a newcomer to the Yankees this year , thinks Jackson has had a tremendous effect on the team ' s success. // " He gets you up in the clubhouse and on the field  --  and he also comes through with the clutch hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Red Sox series . On his first trip to the plate he hits the first pitch into the right-field seats . The next night he does the exact same thing : First trip to the plate , and the first pitch he gets winds up in the screen . We won the first game in extra innings and the other by one run. " // Next year will be Jackson ' s fifth in New York , and some fans are already asking the question directed toward any big star who wears the pin stripes : " Does he measure up to the greats  --  the Mantles , DiMaggios , and Gehrigs ? // " Is he part of the Yankee tradition that was built by Babe Ruth and carried on by those other superstars , or is he merely a glamorous mercenary whose only allegiance is to his wallet and his silver Rolls-Royce ? " // Jackson ' s detractors point to his occasional defensive lapses and to is celebrated run-ins with former manager Billy Martin  --  such as the nationally televised game in Boston when Martin became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled him off the field and almost came to blows with him in a wild dugout scene . " Would a Mantle or DiMaggio have dogged it on a play , or fumbled routine balls as Jackson has done in the past ? " the anti-Reggie chorus asks. // But supporters can point to the fact that , like the Yankee greats who have preceded him , Jackson regularly rises to the occasion when the chips are down  --  especially during the World Series . Although his lifetime batting average for regular season play is . 272 , his World Series average is . 360 . And in his two appearances with New York in the fall classic , 1977 and 1978 , he hit . 450 and . 391. // Regardless of how one feels about Jackson as an individual , one can ' t help being amazed by his ability to perform in key situations. // Steve Garvey summed it up best when he described his reaction to Jackson ' s three home runs during the sixth and decisive game in 1977 . " I must admit , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody was looking , I applauded in my glove , " the Los Angeles first baseman said. // The three homers , coupled with two others , put Jackson in the record books along with none other than Babe Rugh for hitting the most homers in one World Series . And this was only one of many examples Reggie has given through the years of his remarkable ability to come through in the clutch. // Jackson also has his own distinctive way of conveying the grandness of his accomplishments . After hitting a ball that is obviously " gone , " he will stand at the plate admiring his masterpiece as it sails into the stands , then slowly trot around the bases , savoring every cheer from the fans. // For Jackson , 1980 has been one of his more enjoyable years , both on the field and in the clubhouse . In his years with Oakland , of course , he was involved in the general player discontent with eccentric owner Charlie Finley . Then in his first few years in New York the controversies seemed to involve almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fans who often booed when they felt he wasn ' t giving a " million-dollar effort , " and the press , which duly recorded all the problems . But now for the first time since joining the Yankees , and perhaps in his entire career , he has felt a sense of harmony on his team. // " I can play now , " Jackson said . " I don ' t have any battles to fight or any personalities to overcome. " // The turmoil of previous summers no longer exists , and many of his peers have noticed the change in his attitude . As one of the team ' s veterans , he has taken it upon himself to help out some of the younger players . On one occasion he was seen chastising rookie centerfielder Bobby Brown for trying to steal second in a bad situation. // Rick Cerone has nothing but admiration for Jackson . " He is awesome , " says the Yankee catcher . " He leads by example . He never loafs on the field . He plays hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years when even victory wasn ' t that sweet , Reggie Jackson the man has finally come of age. // //
