on the mountains make // their home , // where the river runs those // giant hills between ; // I have seen full many horsemen // since I first commenced to roam , // But nowhere yet such horsemen // have I seen. // WE kept this quote from Banjo Paterson in mind as we stood in the heat of the Tarmac at ' ' Flight Facilities ' ' in the Sydney airport . An hour and a half later our six-passenger Aerocommander landed us safely in Tumut on a tiny airstrip with a small , tidy waiting lounge . Tumut is a mysterious , intriguing name for this rather ordinary town that was spread out in the broad valley at the base of Australia ' s Snowy River Mountain range. // Tumut was to be our meeting point for the Talbingo Rides , and we joined the seven Australians who were to become our riding family for the next five days. // // The ride would begin the next morning after a 5 , 000-foot ascent by bus to the upper plains of Kosciusko National Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia ' s national parks containing the continent ' s only alpine region . The snow-scattered meadows on these plains act like a giant sponge absorbing and releasing water from the melting snows of the high country . Our horses were waiting for us at Witz ' s Hut , a nondescript building in an open field. // Our hostess , Jeanette Miner , greeted us with tea , coffee , cold drinks , and homemade cookies - a preview to the special cooking that was to come. // ' ' Snow , ' ' Jeanette ' s husband , and one of the best-known stockmen of the Snowy River country , was to be our trek guide . A bona fide bushman , Snow was a contained , soft-spoken man , uniformed in green work shirt , blue jeans , and an Acubra hat . His piercing blue eyes sparkled with humor indicating he didn ' t take himself too seriously . He faded in and out like the invisible man who was always there in one form or another , valuable qualities we thought , for a bushman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pony cross averaging 15 to 16 hands . Crystal and Star , our mounts , were exceedingly comfortable , willing , and spunky but manageable. // It would be our job to take care of these responsive equines and to saddle up our own horse each day using the hefty Australian stock saddle . Small slanted wings on the saddle just above the knees help prevent a rider ' s untimely forward motion . The cantle is high , allowing a rider to sit back with legs extended and slanting forward ( the position most often used by the Aussie stockmen ) . Bridles were put on over halters and attached lead lines were given a hangman ' s knots to keep them easily available. // About midmorning , we loaded cameras and sun cream into our saddle bags . Our unchristened Dryzabones , the classic rainwear of the drover and bushman , were tied securely to the fronts of our saddles , where their comforting presence gave us a real feeling of place and history. // We headed off across Wild Horse Plain , a meadow of snow grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hills covered with eucalyptus trees , more often called gums , shimmered blue in the distance , a more intense blue we were told , because of the eucalyptus oil breathed into the atmosphere by these bewitching trees. // A feeling of enormous space encompassed us as we rode along this high tabletop of Australia . At 5 , 000 feet the air was cool and clear . Even the ever-present flies were awed into tranquility , polka-dotting any clear-colored shirt , and hitching a free ride to their next nuisance station . Their unceasing buzzing would initiate the infamous ' ' Australian salute ' ' - a constant slow-motion wave of the hand in front of the face. // About 14 miles out we stopped for lunch and heated water for coffee and ' ' Billy ' ' tea while we munched cold chicken legs , sandwiches , and fruit . The horses had been tied in a nearby eucalyptus glade , where we discovered two horse skulls among the tall grasses . Brumbies - wild horses - had perished during a winter storm , attesting to the severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up at Long Plain , an early stockman ' s camp , now part of the National Trust . Fireplaces with crumbling mortar were at each end of the corrugated-metal roofed building . A passageway ran from front to back with rooms off each side . Here several of our group decided to spread their bed rolls later rather than pitch a tent outside . Our horses were set to graze after they were untacked. // Waking to a wonderful scenic day right out of ' ' The Man from Snowy River , ' ' we caught our horses , brushed and saddled them up to ride off across the plain through snow grass and bush to the headwaters of the Murrinbigee River . The sky went from sun to clouds to sun as Snow picked a narrow spot to cross the swiftly flowing water , avoiding stagnant pools of water called billabongs. // A hill rose before us , rounded domelike with sloping shoulders , and at the top a tuft of trees that could have been green curly hair . Craters filled with large boulders looked like misplaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth across the hillside . A belt-like path moved around the rise , trailing into the distance . Along this narrow pathway the group proceeded single file . Far below a river curled with the look of a stunning snakeskin , rippled in places and sparkling in others from the frothy broil of stone and water. // We rode up the ridge , crossing the plains toward a distant saddle of bluish hills beyond . The rolling plains were wide here and the wild hop scrub grew thickly hiding a ground full of wombat holes . Yet the horses maneuvered expertly over the hidden ground . We stopped abruptly as we neared a stand of stringybarks and saplings . Not far from us near a fallen log was an enormous black eagle . Snow thought it had been injured as we were able to ride quite close before it took off in a thrilling ascent. // So off to scout the mountainside // with eager eyes aglow // To strongholds where the // wild mobs // hide the gullyrakers go. // A slow gradual climb to O ' Rourke ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we entered the meadow whose trails had been marked with pile after pile of stallion droppings. // He had told us earlier , ' ' If a Brumbie sees or hears you , he ' ll let out a snort , wheel and go . ' ' Like good children , our hands went to our mouths and our eyes widened in anticipation . A glade of closely cropped clover imprinted with hoof marks gave hopes of a glimpse of these elusive wild horses . Were we near the stronghold ' ' where the wild mobs hide ' ' ? // The track wound around the hill through groves of silver and green eucalyptus rising among the strewn gray skeletons of dead trees . Puffs of wind found their way through the uneven gallery of gums where the silence , with only the hooves beating softly on the brush and turf , gave a feeling of enchantment . We had entered this hidden territory treading over strands of white strawflowers on into small openings golden with tall dandelions , blue bells , and lichen-covered brush with the look of hairy limbs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rolling of many horses . Were we riding on ' ' Brumbies Run , ' ' in this magical wood ? Our path dropped suddenly 500 feet into a warm and sheltered hollow and up went Snow ' s arm . He pointed . ' ' Six or seven , ' ' he said , and in a flash they were gone. // The traveler by the mountain trackMay hear their hoofbeats pass , And catch a glimpse of brownand black , Dim shadows on the grass . We found it difficult to understand why the wild horses were hunted and shot by park rangers , for it was the romantic vision of these wild horses and the bushmen as set forth in the film , ' ' The Man From Snowy River , ' ' derived from the Paterson poem of the same name , that had brought us 10 , 000 miles . We had been forewarned about Australian flies and had decided to come armed for battle . At home our local feed-store agent had come up with two elegant army-green head nets . During lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise beyond our skill so we chose that moment to quietly don our exotic head nets . Looks of complete amazement and hoots of laughter followed . They decided that the Americans had indeed come well prepared . Sheepskin seat savers , leather half- and full-length chaps , rubbers and L.L. Bean boots to keep the heavy summer dew from soaking footwear , and wonder of wonders - bug bonnets ! The capricious moods of the range weather were revealed as storm clouds and distant thunder rolled ominously toward us , putting all to work trenching the uphill side of the tents . A trap was extended over the supper cooking area and tent pegs were tightened against the gusting wind . Our Dryzbones were unrolled ready to be christened for what promised to be a wet night . Thunder crashed above our heads . The cascading water sealed us under the canvas as we savored our steaks , mashed potatoes with peppercorn sauce , carrots , turnip , and fresh zucchini . Morning bird calls from the bush just before dawn woke us . The rain had gone and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dripping with moisture . We were thankful we had decided to pack rubber-coated footwear . Breakfast as usual was hearty choices of hot porridge , muesli , sausage or bacon and eggs , toast , jams , vegemite , and coffee or tea . Each day the horse trails took us over diverse terrain . The Peppercorn Plain was no exception . Here we moved toward yet another variety of eucalyptus , Black Sally . These picturesque trees reminded us of fresh broccoli with reddish highlights . A darkly dramatic sky made those trees edging the plain even more vivid . And then we saw them in the far distance , at least 70 kangaroos jumping toward a copse of stringybark and sheoak . We followed Snow into the wooded area where we began bushwacking , following no apparent pathway , down into a hollow and up again . Snow ' s hand rose and pointed , half a dozen kangaroos , perhaps 200 feet away , were loping through the undergrowth . All of the legends , myths , and dreams of one born in the Northern Hemisphere came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really were down under ! Later , our group decided to visit the Yarrangobilly Caves . These fascinating caves had been carved from a belt of limestone by the river of the same name . The path to the caves led down a deep gorge with an even steeper drop to an emerald stream far below . Our path faded into the mountain where an enormous , cavernous chamber with a hole , the Glory Hole , opened to the skyline like a direct route to heaven . A green fertile mound within the cave invited the fantasies of a rock gardener or perhaps the placement of a chamber group to weave melodious sounds in the acoustical perfection of the space . Descending into the next chamber was like heaven into hell . Here smooth white forms like partially melted marble urged themselves up from the cave bottom , stalagmites , yet more like frozen souls caught in a time warp . The next cavern was also unique . On its ceiling were tiny stalactites like miniature fir trees on a snow-covered mountain - an upside-down version of the American Rockies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds in the east were rimmed with orange , changing to shades of pink , creating an alpine glow . Shades of blue and purple washed over the sub-alpine meadows and distant hills as the sun sank behind the tall eucalyptus grove west of the campsite . Locusts , bush wrens , and crickets from the wood thickets bordering the camp summoned the evening and the dusting of stars to come . After exchanging hilarious stories , the group , which had firmly bonded by this time , fell into a reverential silence and Snow began a reading of his favorite Banjo Paterson poems . A small shower of sparks lit up the night as a burned out log fell , as our Snowy River dream came became reality . He hails from Snowy River , up byKosciusko ' s side , Where the hills are twice as steepand twice as rough , Where a horse ' s hoofs strike firelight from the flint stoneevery stride , The man that holds his own isgood enough . This was the man and his Kosciusko . We felt privileged to have had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bush . A faint glow remained at the heart of the campfire ' s dying embers as we moved reluctantly to our tents . This final night had been glorious with its pale congregation of stars and the cool unblinking eye of the moon sailing above the silent gray ghosts of the gum trees . The sad two-toned cadence of the Australian owl echoed our feelings as it warned us , like a distant foghorn , that our time was up . The bush was inscrutable , ageless , and self-contained . It was we who were wholly irrelevant . Fog lay in the plain as we rose the next morning to a crackling fire and the smell of bacon . We finally agreed to sample the foul-smelling vegemite , a yeasty concentrate which is spread on toast , and thoroughly enjoyed the looks of repulsion on each other ' s faces . Tents were packed up and luggage stowed aboard the Land Rover . We left camp in the morning , pushing our horses into a fast 4 - mile per hour walk . Dark shadows of brown , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of gigantic prehistoric birds . In Colorado , they would call it a sundance . Where it grew longer , the grass moved as does the sea when the wind is passing by . The track took us up to Mt . Tantangara , 6 , 200 feet . We rode through a forest of gnarled gums turned into agonized forms as if by some ancient Merlin . One tree in a tortured , twisted pose , long fingers extended to the ceaseless wind , was a Martha Graham from another world . Others , collapsed and fallen , like undiscovered ivory and ancestral bones in an old elephant burial ground , reminded those passing that not all days were as kind and lovely as this . At the top , a shower of golden wattle appeared at the base of some of these bleached edifices . Suddenly the whole world seemed to spread out before us in a spectacular 360-degree view of Australia ' s rooftop . Snow had saved this piece de resistance as his closing gift to us . We were grateful . A sensation of fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden wattle spilled down the warmer side of Tantangara ' s olive green bush . Sharp , flinty stones made it slow going as the horses picked their way down toward Wild Horse Plain . It was the fine line of the state highway and the sight of the placewhere the ride had begun that inspired a last burn - hard ride . Dirt , small stones , and mouthfuls of dust flew as our posse headed for home and the final goodbyes . As the bus took us along the Park Highway back to Tumut , we gazed at the wild scenery of the hills , valleys , and plains . We knew now what it was like . We could hear the gurgle of those streams , the squishing of muddy wet grasses and the language of birds , see the variety of tiny wild blossoms , mottled backs of gum trees , and textures of wild grasses . Too soon our adventure was over , yet we needed to evolve a little more slowly out of our completed dream . A six-hour train ride back to Sydney seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rolling plains in those folded hills of the Snowy River Mountain Range to become a memory. // //
