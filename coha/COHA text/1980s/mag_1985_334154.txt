There is no coat of arms on the flask , but somewhere in one of Britain 's hospitals a convalescent patient has some of the world 's most exclusive blood flowing through his or her veins . The regal donor of the precious stuff was Prince Charles , 36 , who has become the first member of the royal family ever to give blood , in his case , O Rh-negative . The unprecedented puncturing of royalty was to reassure Britons after a nationwide scare about AIDS caused a drop in donations . At the North London Transfusion Center , the Prince was asked whether he was homosexual , injected drugs into his veins or had had sex with anyone in those two groups . After those regulation indignities ( and his negative answers ) , he had an apprehensive question of his own : " Is it going to hurt ? " When the pint was finally drawn , Charles pretended to apologize because his blood was not blue : " I 'm afraid it 's red like anyone else 's . " Fancy that .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
