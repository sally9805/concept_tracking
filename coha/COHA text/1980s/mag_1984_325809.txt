Washington effusively embraces an embattled Mitterrand <P> From the moment Franois Mitterrand stepped off the Concorde in Washington last week , he was accorded a hero 's welcome . A booming 21-gun salute and brassy rendition of La Marseillaise greeted the French President on the White House lawn . He was invited to address Congress , a conspicuous honor for a visiting head of state . At a sparkling state dinner , with Ronald Reagan as host , he was feted in the company of such luminaries as Actor James Stewart and Novelist William Styron . Throughout it all , the warm words flowed like champagne . Calling his country " a constant ally that can be counted on , " Mitterrand described the U.S. and France as " brothers in arms , who from Yorktown all the way through the ages to Beirut have shed their blood together .

A staunch advocate of the Atlantic Alliance , the French President strongly supported the deployment of new U.S. missiles on European soil . He contributed 2,000 men to the Multi-National Force in Beirut ( the last to depart , the French plan to withdraw this week ) and dispatched some 3,000 troops to halt a Libyan-backed rebellion in Chad . The only major disagreement is on U.S. policy in Central America , which Mitterrand implicitly criticized during his speech to Congress . " Civil wars are not triggered by external influence alone , even if they may serve foreign interests , " he said , alluding to Reagan 's contention that the Soviet Union is behind the region 's turmoil . <P> East-West relations dominated the private talks at the White House .

" <P> The White House sessions , which lasted four hours , touched upon a menu of issues , including French complaints about high exchange rates and the burgeoning U.S. deficit . Despite the language barrier , the two men got along well , exchanging cheerful banter while photographers clicked away . As bulbs flashed , Mitterrand noted wryly to Reagan that " George Washington faced a much quieter life . "
