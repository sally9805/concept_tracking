Some say the reason for it is Urban Cowboy . Others say it 's simply this decade 's answer to disco . And still others maintain it 's a " cultural pattern , " that after a country 's 200th birthday , its people start reflecting on their past  --  and musicalizing their heritage . For whatever reasons , one thing is abundantly clear : Country-western dancing is southern California 's latest craze . " Overland Stage Restaurant and Territorial Saloon , " " Stardust Barn Dance , " " Topanga Corral " ? look in any entertainment section , whether you 're in Anaheim or Ojai , and you 'll come across plenty of country-and-western locales advertising such colorfully named groups as " James Lee &; the Gators , " " Duke Davis &; Buckshot " or the " Doo-Wah Riders . " " What 's happened in California is that this has become a phenomenon in the last couple of years , and every other place is now teaching country-western dancing , " explains Maggie Houlihan , who used to teach country-western dancing by night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogs books at the local public library by day . " The easiest dances to teach to a large group of people are Eight Corners , ' ' The Two-Step ' or The Polka . ' Even though it takes concentration , you can pretty much pick ' em up in half an hour 's time . " I 've been teaching at various clubs now for the past eight years . Sundays are usually my regular class , and that 's a six-week course with four weeks of swing . I teach a two-step and then ' Eight Corners ' and the ' Sweetheart Shotish ' and then the Photography by David Sutton ' Flying Eights . ' Then , in the last two weeks , I teach ' em the ' Three-Step Polka , ' ' The Texas Polka ' and ' Cotton-Eyed Joe . ' And for all that , there 's a $15 charge for a lifetime membership . You can take the course over and over if you like . -f used to teach for free , " adds Maggie . " But I found if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious commitment . So then I decided to charge because it makes people feel responsible . And if people are putting something out , even as little as $15 , they feel like they 've got to get their money 's worth . " Judging from the clothing of Maggie 's students  --  the all-suede skirts and brightly plumed felt hats ? $15 is n't going to be much of a strain on their budgets at all . And for most , it appears , the en-j oyment and the exercise they get from the dancing make it more than worth the price . " Our most expensive outfit ( i.e. suede vest for $110 ; suede skirt for $270 ) is also our most popular one , " admits Joan Warren , wife of Rodeo 's owner , Bruce Warren , and manager of the nightclub 's clothing store . " Everybody likes the feel of soft things . That 's why they buy suede . And also , it is n't that easily available . You do n't find suede in every store . But mostly , it feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy expressions on those partner-swinging , hand-clapping customers can be believed , is the dancing . Nutritionist Dr. Richard Smith has said of country-western dancing , " It 's a fun thing to do . It 's very stylish currently . And it 's great exercise . If you do several sets , you can work up quite a bit of perspiration . ' ' CountryIvvestern dancing is intimately associated with country-western music . And according to the country-western music aficionados gathered around Rodeo 's expansive and well-stocked bar , the man responsible for the twangy , honky-tonk sound known as C &W; is Bob Wills . The son of 1 sharecrop-per , Wills and his Toxas Playboys ' . gainedpopularity in the late ' 30s . And because he grew up working with a lot of blacks , his music was influenced by spirituals and Dixieland jazz as well . He incorporated those two musical traditions with the ' big band sound , ' added a fiddle with a pedal steel sound , and that 's what eventually became what we now call country-western , " ventures Maggie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polkas . " If you listen to Bob Wills ' music , it 's got a much more subtle beat than disco . With disco the beat was everything . Throbbing . Pulsating . And every step you did reflected that beat , " continues Ms. Houlihan , eyeing one of her newer students with approval as he swings his partner with just the right amount of Western panache . " With country and western , it 's a subtle beat you 're keeping . If people are doing it right , they are n't hopping up and down . They 're keeping the beat . " A more down-to-earth definition of country-western dancing and its current popularity is offered by Rodeo 's general manager Jeff Blum : " It 's easy to do . That 's why people like it . And as long as it 's easy for people to dance , that 's how long it 'll be in vogue . Disco died as soon as it got too hard to dance . " Although a native Californian , Blum has spent the last seven years managing country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs , mostly . Places where , on the Fourth of July , somebody would ride their horse into the club ! " As general manager of Rodeo ( pronounced Ro-day-o ) , Jeff is in charge of a very fancy , very elegant club . According to him , the clientele is hip and generally affluent . " They drive Porsches , and are always on the lookout for a good time , " laughs Blum , who , in a more candid moment , described the whole scene as " a meat rackthat happens to be Western . " " The real cowboys , the ones I knew back in Idaho , would think this crowd is ridiculous . Cowboys do n't wear cowboy hats anymore . They wear those caps that say things on ' em like ' Mac ' or ' Coors ' or ' Bull Durham ' .... " But the point to most dancers is n't what they wear . It 's whether or not they 're having a good time . " Here , lemme help you , " shouts a young man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's supposed to be turning . There are young folks here and older folks , too ; couples and guys and girls without partners . And now that Maggie Houlihan 's Thursday night warm-up is over , the band is really " beginning to cook . " Naturally , there are a few " selfCon tinued on page 89 THE SATURDAY EVENINC POST Keeping Fit continued from page 77 adoring strutters " who inevitably play to the crowd with acrobatic turns and highly stylized poses . No matter what the current dance is , those types will always be around . But for the rest of these many dancers , it 's a " mashed potato " here , a dip there . Turn ... two .. . three ... four . . A common mistake made by those unfamiliar with country-western dancing is that this art form is the same thing as square dancing . Almost anyone at Rodeo can set one straight on that point . " Square dancing 's a whole lot different than this , " enthuses a toe-tapping " cowboy , " one of Rodeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing . For another , it 's led by a caller . And wherever you go , whether it 's upper state New York or Oregon or Colorado , the steps are the same . " Square dancing 's really structured . You absolutely have to know what everybody in the whole group is doing . " Maggie Houlihan further explains . " If you 're comparing it to ' Eight Corners , ' it 's pretty much the same thing . You 've got to know the steps there , too . But you do n't have to have a partner with ' Eight Corners . ' You can just get out on the line and join any group . " I dance with women a lot  --  because there are n't enough guys to go around . But if you 're talking about ' The Swing ' ? Well , that 's entirely different . " A lot of turns , a lot of spins , a lot of fancy steps . It 's nothing like square dancing . " Talent agency head Jeanne Jennay could n't agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the different dances . But I like the ones where you get in a line . " When people come in a room and they do n't know each other , if they 're doing the line dance , all of a sudden they 're all together  --  and it really does n't make any difference who they are . " There 's a saying painted above the stucco entranceway of Rodeo that reads : " Through these doors pass no strangers , simply friends who have not met . " That 's the tone of country-western dancing , California-style : friendly , easygoing . Is it just another West Coast craze like surf music and flower children ? Perhaps . But while it lasts , for those who are a part of its freewheeling grace , there 'll be a " whole lotta good times " ahead .... A
