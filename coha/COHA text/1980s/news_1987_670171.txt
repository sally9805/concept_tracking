CHICAGO  --  Fred Williamson , movie star , ticks off the virtues of " The Messenger , " his latest film : " It ' s written by me , directed by me , produced by me and starring me , " he says . If modesty were important in the movie business , Mr. Williamson probably would be broke . Instead , the man with the Cinemascope-sized ego has struck it rich in his own tiny niche of the industry : making inexpensive action-adventure pictures for black movie audiences . At a premiere of " The Messenger " at the Wood Theater here , the big man dressed in black suede steps from a limousine to sign autographs . As he stands under the faded marquee , someone asks whether his film is any good . " Man , I ain ' t never made no bad movie , " he scowls in his movie persona . While most critics would debate that point , Mr. Williamson can boast that , unlike most Hollywood moguls , he has yet to lose money on a film . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his Chicago-based company , usually spends about $500 , 000 to produce a movie . And with a die-hard following of about 100 theaters across the U.S. , it can usually count on profits about twice that . Typically , it takes Mr. Williamson about three weeks to finish a movie . He keeps payroll costs low by casting Hollywood has-beens and unknowns , and saves on distribution expenses by peddling the films himself , out of the back seat of a Cadillac . The movies also might cost a little less because they all have the same plot : Mr. Williamson guns down the bad guys . " Bronson likes to shoot people , Eastwood likes to shoot people , and I like to shoot people , " he says . He wrote the script for his latest picture while his wife prepared dinner one night . Mr. Williamson , 49 , makes these movies because they sell . He is the only black actor who regularly appears as a leading man in action films . Hollywood ended its casting of black heroes in violent , so-called blaxploitation films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , " When I was a kid , I always wanted to be the fastest gun and win every fight . Now I do . " Except , perhaps , the fight to win over critics . " I ' m convinced he knows he can ' t act , " says Elvis Mitchell of the Detroit Free Press , one of the few blacks in the ranks of U.S. film critics . " He gets by on a smirk , or  --  if he ' s really trying to be expressive  --  a smirk and a cigar clenched in his teeth . " The Chicago Tribune attacked " The Messenger " as a " violent travelogue . " A typical Po ' Boy production , " The Messenger " contains scenes from such exotic locales as Italy and Las Vegas . The star plays a former Green Beret who also happens to be a musical prodigy and a killer of gangsters . An advertisement for the film shows Mr. Williamson pulling the trigger of a fancy pistol , and declares : " Take aim . Fire . Drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the movie has cleared about $400 , 000 , Mr. Williamson says . When a film is finished , he works the phone in his lakefront Chicago condominium , coaxing local distributors to run advertisements for his film in return for a piece of the profits . During one such session , Bob Murawski , a Detroit distributor , worries that " The Messenger " has too much competition this summer . But Mr. Williamson pleads , " Look , I ' ll be in the lobby wherever the picture is . You don ' t have to set up the local television and radio interviews . I ' ll just call ' em up and say , ' Fred ' s here . ' " Mr. Murawski agrees to spend $5 , 000 on ads . In the studios of local disk jockeys and talk-show hosts , Mr. Williamson rhapsodizes on how tough he is . When Cheryl Fisher , a disk jockey on WDZZ-FM in Flint , Mich. , asks whether he has ever been intimidated , he admits to one such encounter . " It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s no longer alive . " His braggadocio prompts Ms. Fisher to respond , on the air , " Fred , you ' re so overcool . " Fans , however , love his tough-guy image . " He looks great when he ' s blowing the bad dudes away , " says admirer Alfreda Johnson , a Detroit typist . Mr. Williamson says his roles purposely allow just a trace of tenderness , which the villains inevitably stomp on . " Then the audience is behind me while I kill anybody I want , " he says . Unable to afford market research , he does his own by slipping into theaters unannounced and sitting in the back . " Blacks talk to their stars on the screen . If they hear a clever line , they ' ll say , ' Get down . ' But if they don ' t like what I ' m doing , they say , ' Fred , that ain ' t nothing . ' " Mr. Williamson stereotypes himself . But that ' s a shrewd move , says Samuel Goldwyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry always sticking to one theme : the Bible . " Mr. Williamson began his entertainment career as a professional football player , where he got the nickname he still uses in film : " The Hammer . " As a player for the Kansas City Chiefs , he vowed to crack the helmets of the Green Bay Packers in the first Super Bowl . Instead , he was knocked unconscious during the game . After 10 years of pro football , he began a short-lived career as an architect . He envisioned designing tall buildings but instead landed a job sketching popcorn machines . He longed for the lost limelight . In 1970 , by faking a phone call from a producer to security guards , he bluffed his way into the Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. studio that made the television comedy series " Julia . " He landed a part , which lasted two years , and parlayed that into roles in such forgettable films as " Hell Up in Harlem " and " Black Caesar . " He used savings of $110 , 000 to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1974 . With no willing distributors in sight , he packed a dozen prints of the movie off to the Cannes Film Festival on the French Riviera . Nearly broke , he staked out a table at a seaside cafe , surrounded himself with starlets paid to wear T-shirts promoting the film and hired a theater to show it . Distributors flocked to buy rights to show his movie in Italy , Spain and Taiwan . " In a week I had checks totaling $230 , 000 , " he says . Mr. Williamson is now working on a new film , " Delta Force Commando , " which will be made in Brazil . He got the idea for the title by combining Chuck Norris ' s " Delta Force " and Arnold Schwarzenegger ' s " Commando . " Always looking for cheap publicity , he is hoping for a lawsuit . He admits envy at lavish Hollywood budgets such as the estimated $50 million spent on Columbia Pictures ' " Ishtar " but adds that bigger budgets don ' t guarantee better films .
