PUNCHLINE Directed and Written by David Seltzer <P> Lilah Krytsick ( Sally Field ) is discovered skulking into the kind of 24-hour diner that , in movies , betokens a Mafia presence . And sure enough , a disreputable little man is soon slipping her a mysterious packet . Dope ? Money for laundering ? No , jokes . As it turns out , terrible jokes . Jokes that produce a distillation of pure flop sweat when she tries them out at a comedy club called the Gas Station , where beginning comics mostly improvise their own humiliations . For Lilah is a bored New Jersey housewife who has been told all her life that she is a funny lady and dreams of public confirmation of that status . Steve Gold ( Tom Hanks ) is a sort of drug-free Lenny Bruce , brilliantly spritzing free-associational social comment and autobiography . If Lilah is trying to escape the traps of the lower-middle class , Steve is trying to avoid the respectability and stultification of the upper-middle class . <P> Will they meet ? Will he try to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Need you ask ? Will these two succumb to romantic entanglement ? Well , no . Despite nicely managed temptation , they avoid it , and credit goes to David Seltzer for that intelligent choice . And for a movie that is full of terrific comic material and well-cast second bananas ( John Goodman as Lilah 's befuddled husband , Max Alexander and Mac Robbins as ne'er-do-well comedians ) . <P> But Seltzer is not able to maintain a crucial balance : the one that his script intends between his two stars . Field is , as always , coolly expert , but with as much mystery about her as a bottle of Mop &; Glo . Hanks , on the other hand , is our reigning master of desperate expediency . His amuck parody of Gene Kelly 's Singin ' in the Rain number goes into realms beyond performance . <P> But Field 's company co-produced the picture before Hanks was Big , and Oscar- winning stars do have certain hierarchical rights . In the final sequence , where Lilah and Steve must duel onstage over a TV contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her star turn . And she gets to make all the interesting moral choices . But that is just Hollywood housekeeping  --  neatening up after the picture has been stolen . R.S.
