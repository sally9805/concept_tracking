Apparently not . For 10 years , at least , the existence of a wine explosion in the early 1970 ' s has been part of our accepted wine wisdom . Sort of like the big-bang theory about the beginning of the universe , only for wine . Recently , however , the revisionists have been having their day . There never was a wine explosion , they say ; it never happened. // The latest exponent of the no-bang theory is George W. Frank , recently retired after 30 years of selling for Ernest and Julio Gallo . Writing in a trade journal called Market Watch , Mr. Frank asserts that the big bang was actually a " big fizzle " and he points the accusatory finger back over his shoulder , at the industry. // " The wine explosion that never materialized , " he writes , " was really destroyed by the industry while still in its embryonic stage . " He means , of course , that the explosion was in embryo , not the industry. // Nor was it some single egregious blunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Mr. Frank . " There is plenty of blame for the whole industry to share , " he says , with enough left over to include a group he calls " the wine experts/ critics/writers. " // Condensed drastically , Mr. Frank ' s points seem to be these : // * The industry confused the " pop " wine and white wine booms with a consumer interest in table wines and never attempted to build a real base of traditional wine drinking. // * Instead of promoting the idea of wine , the producers went at each other ' s throats , each claiming his wine was better than the competitors. // * The industry created " a dazzling array " of varietal names , geographical designations , vintage years and proprietary names , all of which served to confuse the consumer and turn him away rather than encourage him to drink wine. // * The industry pushed a staggering variety of products on the retailers , who were every bit as overwhelmed by label proliferation as were their customers. // * Many retailers adopted a pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking advantage of the customer while confusing him. // * The writers contributed to the big fizzle , Mr. Frank believes , by talking , or writing , straight over the consumer ' s head . Most wine writing , he says , " is indeed a case of all you ever wanted to know about wine and a damn sight more . " He also believes that the wine makers knuckled under to these writers and changed the style of their wines to suit the " expert " rather than the " public " taste. // Mr. Frank is a marketing man and it is only natural that he views the parlous state of the wine business through a marketer ' s eyes . And , in fact , there is truth in just about every point he makes . Certainly the failure to realize that few people were drinking wine with meals was a major blunder . Even the Wine Institute based its promotions on wine ' s being " the drink of moderation " because it was consumed with food. // Sometimes it is difficult not to conclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , while most good wine is analyzed by bores at tastings. // Wine selling is a rough-and-tumble business at the wholesale level , just like the liquor business , but the face shown to the public was a gentlemanly one , at least until Coca-Cola got into the act . Coke shocked everyone by running advertisements claiming that its wine was better than the competition ' s . Did it hurt the business ? Hard to say . In principle , competition is a good thing . Going from a Ford salesman to a Chevrolet salesman can be confusing too. // As for that " dazzling array " of wine names , place names and grape names , the industry didn ' t create them , as Mr. Frank says . They were there all along ; it ' s the way wine works . France has always had a two-tier wine system : inexpensive red and white , sold without ceremony in liter bottles , and its complicated system of regions and appellations and vintages . In recent years , the cheap reds and whites have been losing ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing in popularity at all economic levels except the very lowest . No , it probably isn ' t right to blame the system. // The proliferation of labels is something else . Only a few years ago , retailers were bragging , some with straight faces , that they could offer 40 different California chardonnays , 28 cabernet sauvignons and a zinfandel for each day of the month . To whom ? The average guy looking for a bottle to go with his fish or steak ? To their credit , most consumers , even wine enthusiasts , shrugged and walked away or stuck with a few wines they had come to know . Most of those vast selections have disappeared . But Mr. Frank is right , they didn ' t make wine buying any easier. // As for pricing , the retailers are less to blame here than the restaurants , the true testing grounds for the wine business . Restaurants have always overcharged for wine . They do it blatantly and shrug off criticism . What arguments they offer are refuted by the handful of restaurants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers , Mr. Frank is right : they - we - tend to get carried away . But then , we are dealing with the enthusiasts , the cultists . Most columns in a general-circulation publication assume some interest and prior knowledge or at least a certain level of sophistication on the part of the reader . A regular diet of columns on personal tasting notes , of stories about auctions of rare wines and visits to exclusive private cellars will eventually pall on most readers . On the other hand , a sort of weekly primer for the uninitiated would be just as untenable. // One suspects that Mr. Frank may be a bit overcritical . Certainly there have been mistakes made . His own mentors , the Gallos , constantly introduce new products that fail . They also introduce wines that become great successes and the envy of the trade . If there was a single major error , it was that failure to interpret wine-drinking habits and to realize that so much of what was happening was merely an extension of set consumer patterns to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all those wineries ? Some 600 in California alone . Dozens more in Oregon and Washington . A whole new wine industry on Long Island . An explosion ? In the huge inexpensive wine market , no . In the fine wine area , very much so . Will it last ? Almost certainly . Will it grow as in the 1970 ' s ? Probably not . But that ' s not a fizzle. //
