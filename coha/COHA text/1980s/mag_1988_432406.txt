 | The time is the near future , and you 're a student assigned to learn about ecology . But instead of plowing through out-of-date reports and badly drawn graphs , you 're about to take a video adventure . You sit in front of two video monitors , a computer and a new hypermedia program from Lucasfilm . On one screen , an animated cartoon introduces Paul Parkranger , who invites you into his office . Meanwhile , on the other screen , a color film shows migrating ducks taking off from a lush green marsh . On the first screen , the ranger confides that the duck population is diminishing and he needs you to help find the reason . The evidence is in his notebooks and cabinets , on the screen in front of you . Using the computer 's mouse to move the on-screen image of a tiny hand , you " open " a file cabinet , take out a folder marked " Interviews . " Suddenly the other screen fills with the image of a real farmer , talking about the ducks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet turns out to contain a dozen similar interviews with hunters , naturalists and game wardens ? along with animated maps and articles about ducks . Using the mouse , you browse through the films , text and photographs , letting your curiosity lead the way . In the end , you fashion a theory of what forces are driving the ducks away . This simulates real life : there is no single right answer . But there is a process to learn and it 's called thinking . Thanks to the new computer capability , that 's one lesson students need n't overlook . Hypermedia is here : a powerful blend of computers , video , photography and sound , already arriving on campuses and scheduled to reach homes late next year . From filmmaker George Lucas 's California headquarters , where Paul Parkranger was created , to Cornell University Medical College in New York , where students study anatomy on computer screens , researchers are developing a new medium which may transform education and entertainment as profoundly as has television . " The intensity of what you see and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film , " says Stephen Arnold of Lucasfilm . " Only you can interact with it . It 's a new kind of imaginary playground for the mind . " Command center : Hypermedia uses optical discs ? big brothers of the compact discs used for music ? to store not just sound but printed text , still photographs and motion-picture clips for replay on video screens . An optical disc can hold an almost unmanageable amount of information ? tens of thousands of color photographs , along with enough text to fill a small library . And a new kind of computer software , called hypertext , organizes that data so that browsers move easily from subject to subject without needing an index or table of contents . In this system , the computer becomes a command center , controlling the optical-disc play and instantly summoning whatever images , text or sound the user wants . The results can be stunning . At Stanford University School of Medicine , for example , Drs . Steven Freedman and Robert Chase have created Electric Cadaver , a hypermedia anatomy primer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from knee joints to the nerves of the face , simply by moving a cursor on a computer screen . By working with images , the student can manipulate a body in ways not possible with a real subject . For instance , a student can " paralyze " each facial nerve and , on screen , a small human face instantly shows the resultant drooping lip or canted smile . At Cornell University Medical College , an even more elaborate hypermedia system puts large color computer monitors right in dormitories . Among other things , students can use the system to review lecture notes , inspect X-rays or examine color photographs of organs . But those are only first steps . A student looking at a photograph of the liver can instantly summon up text 144 NEWSWEEK : OCTOBER 3 , 1988  | describing liver disease , then compare that with slides of liver biopsies , all on the same screen . " Hypermedia , " says Dr. Daniel Alonso , a pathology professor at Cornell , " will fundamentally change the way we teach . " Hypermedia can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written word . At Lowell High School in San Francisco , teacher Patricia Hanlon and school librarian Robert Campbell worked with Apple Computer to develop a hypermedia accompaniment to John Steinbeck 's " The Grapes of Wrath . " Students read the novel , then sit down to a computer-controlled videodisc player , loaded with Depression-era radio programs , photographs , film footage and magazine articles ( box ) . They can use the system to study dozens of aspects of life in America during the 1930s . Curious about the music of the era ? The system will play a sampling of Woody Guthrie 's songs . Interested in agriculture ? The system can spit back crop yields , climatic conditions and nascent federal-aid programs . Never heard a fireside chat ? Franklin Roosevelt is just a keystroke away . This is the ultimate research tool for a generation raised on television and stereo systems . " These students have been consumers of media , " Hanlon says . " We want to let them become manipulators of media . " With hypermedia , the works of Shakespeare become user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers to convert the text into a multimedia experience . At the end of a passage from " Hamlet , " students can call up film clips of the scene on a video screen , occasionally freezing the action to consult the written text or switching among different performances for a moment-by-moment comparison . A click of the mouse replaces the original soundtrack with an interior monologue , suggesting what characters might be thinking as they speak their lines . To study the mechanics of acting , the student might ask to see " entrances " ; the monitor would display clips of entrances from Shakespeare productions . Christmas tree : Hypermedia is evolving slowly . Broderbund Software Inc. is publishing a hypermedia version of The Whole Earth Catalog ; when the catalog recommends a phonograph record , for example , it will also play a brief sample of the music . Random House will soon market a college biology textbook that offers , along with traditional lab manuals and study guides , an optional set of hypermedia discs . And the National Geographic Society is preparing a hypermedia geography tutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . Hypermedia players wo n't show up under the Christmas tree this year . A computer plus an optical-disc player still costs at least $3,000 , so businesses and universities are likely to be the first customers . But next year , manufacturers such as Philips and Sony plan to introduce a new kind of compact-disc player which will produce hypermedia images and sound directly through home television sets . The projected cost of the player is under $1,000 and more than a dozen publishers , including Time-Life Books Inc. , Grolier and the Smithsonian Institution are preparing hypermedia discs for the new machines . Problems remain for hypermedia . Not everyone even agrees on the name . Apple researchers prefer " interactive multimedia " ; Sony and Philips have dubbed their home version CD-I , for Compact Disc Interactive . More important , producers are only now beginning to learn how to make the new medium easy to use . " Here are all these sights and sounds suddenly available , " says Kristina Hooper , a senior Apple designer . " How do we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information ? " Few researchers doubt the new medium 's prospects . " It 's like the early days of movies , " says Lucasfilm 's Arnold , " only we 're already much further along . " All that awaits is a really hyper D. W. Griffith. @#
