Minnesota pitcher Al Williams sat in the clubhouse before the Twins ' home opener two weeks ago checking his TV choices with a remote control . Williams switched to a news show just as a reporter said , " ... and we 'll begin to find out about Jimmy Eisenreich . " The clubhouse suddenly went quiet , and Williams quickly changed channels . But the unspoken thought on everyone 's mind had already been voiced . // Eisenreich , who turns 25 this week , is a talented centerfielder , fast enough to run down balls hit in the alleys and to bat leadoff . He jumped from Class A to the majors in the spring of 1982 , and Minnesota owner Calvin Griffith said Eisenreich was " doomed to become an All-Star centerfielder . " He has so much promise that manager Billy Gardner says he 'll mean 10 or 15 extra wins this year if he can play 140 games . // But for two years Eisenreich has been severely afflicted by a nervous condition akin to stage fright . At its worst , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 games in 1982 , batting .303 . Last year he quit after two games . Eisenreich has come back once more , and although teammates say he looks 100% better , that 's no guarantee his potentially brilliant career has been saved . Despite the Twins ' sincere efforts to ease his second comeback  --  through Sunday he had n't faced a lefthanded starter or played an inning in the field on the road  --  Eisenreich was struggling at the plate . He was hitting .240 in 25 at bats as a platooning centerfielder and designated hitter , but there was no way to measure his state of mind . // A person instrumental in his comeback , St. Paul hypnotist Harvey Misel , worries that the Twins may be too protective of Eisenreich . " They 're really walking on eggshells around him , " says Misel . " That might not be the best thing . Everybody is afraid to say something or do something wrong . No one on the team has a pipeline to him . If he just had somebody to use as a sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Eisenreich has dreamed of playing for the Twins since he was five , growing up in St. Cloud , 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis . He 's the kind of young man hometowns are proud to claim . He does n't drink , smoke , swear or chase women . " He 's wonderfully square , " says Pat Dolan , his high school baseball coach . " He 's the all-American boy . He deserves better than what life has dealt him . I have no doubt that if he could lick this thing he would be a Hall of Famer. " // When Eisenreich was eight , life dealt him the nervous affliction that has twice threatened to end his career . But until ' 82 it was no big deal . " He used to hum in class , perhaps to offset or overcome it , " says Dolan , who was also Eisenreich 's reading teacher at St. Cloud Tech . // The condition had never affected his play until he reached the majors . The Twins drafted Eisenreich in the 16th round in 1980 following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two successful seasons in the minors , then vaulted to the majors. // " The amounts of pressure put on someone in the majors can completely destroy him , " says Twin third baseman Gary Gaetti . " Being on the road , away from home . The press , for sure . That 's what it stands for , does n't it  --  pressure ? " // Eisenreich , " Eisie " to teammates , opened the ' 82 season as Minnesota 's starting centerfielder . When the club embarked on a 10-game road trip on April 16 , Eisenreich was hitting .344 . But then something happened . His condition markedly worsened . Nobody knows what triggered it , but Twins ' executive Tom Mee remembers one of the earliest manifestations  --  an episode that took place before the last game of the trip . Mee and Eisenreich were attending Mass , sitting in a back pew , as was Eisenreich 's wont . " Jim put his head down on the pew in front of us , " Mee says , " and started shaking . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twitching for the first time . After he had left four straight games , his nervous condition was reported in a newspaper in Boston , where the Twins were playing . That night Red Sox fans sitting in the center-field bleachers verbally stoned him . " What inning are you leaving tonight ? " and " It 's a little cold ; I 'm shivering , too , " and " Are you an epileptic ? " It was obscene , and it drove Eisenreich from the field in the third inning . Though he was hitting .310 , Eisenreich was benched for the next three games . On the third night , in Milwaukee , he ran into the clubhouse tearing at his clothes and yelling , " I ca n't breathe ! " With teammate Mickey Hatcher at his side , he spent most of the night in a hospital emergency room . // " I just get nervous , " he said at the time . " When I think about it and try to correct it , I make it worse . The more I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forget about it and have fun , I 'm O.K. " // Other ballplayers , including Steve Carlton and Jesus Alou , have had tics . Other ballplayers have had fears . Jackie Jensen feared flying . Jimmy Piersall , who had a nervous breakdown , called his autobiography Fear Strikes Out . Almost to a man , ballplayers fear failure . But no one else in memory was so overcome with anxiety that he could n't play the game . // The Twins had no precedent to guide them . Team doctors prescribed medication and behavior modification . Before the ' 83 season , Eisenreich told The Orlando Sentinel , " I do n't know what 's wrong with me . No one else does , either . If I go to four doctors , I get four opinions . // " I 've had the problem since I was eight , but I controlled it until last year . Since I never acted that way before , I never realized I had such a severe problem . When I was finally placed on the disabled list and hospitalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , someone is going to help me. ' " // He needed even more help . Last summer he began seeing Misel , who has counseled a number of big leaguers , including Rod Carew , Tom Paciorek and Bill Buckner . Misel had more than a dozen sessions with Eisenreich from July to October . Rather than try to cure Eisenreich 's ailment , Misel tried to help him cope with it . " I told him not to give in to it , the same way he would n't give in with an 0-2 count , " Misel says . // At each session , Misel repeated over and over the same posthypnotic suggestion : " Jim , you 're going to play well and feel good about it . Concentrate on the game and be more involved with the game than you are with the crowd . " // During the summer Eisenreich played an entire season of town ball for the St. Cloud Saints . He hit .632 and led the Saints to the state title . With Misel 's encouragement , Eisenreich put on his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metrodome . Two months later Eisenreich had his final session with Misel . In January , Eisenreich told him he felt fine and did n't want to continue hypnosis. // Ultimately , it appears , Eisenreich must wage his battle alone . After his ' 82 ordeal in Boston , he said , " I 'm just bothering myself right now . It 's up to me . It 's a thing I 've got to do myself . " Says Misel , " It 's like somebody trying to fight his own shadow . " // Since starting spring training with eight straight hits , Eisenreich has struggled at the plate , getting only 18 hits in his last 86 spring and regular-season appearances . The Twins claim that they are n't worried , though . " He looks about the same as last year , " Gardner says . " His timing is a little off , but he has n't played for a year . He has a tender left elbow right now and that might affect his swing . " // The Twins have started using Eisenreich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to mend , says Gardner . But the Twins may also have wanted to put some distance between Eisenreich and the crowds , particularly in places like New York and Boston . Although Eisenreich seems to be more relaxed before games in which he is n't slated to start , Gardner says , " He 's the same all the time . He looks the best I 've seen him in two years . He 's enjoying himself . He 's much more relaxed . " // Eisenreich has taken some pressure off himself by not talking to reporters . When Hatcher recently asked him to speak to one , the mere suggestion of an interview triggered a nervous reaction . // Eisenreich should n't be simply written off as a loner . " When he was a high school junior , " Dolan says , " the seniors constantly made him the butt of jokes , because he could handle it . They 'd say he could n't steal or he could n't hit lefthanders or he could n't pull the ball . Then he 'd go out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a junior . " // Fans across the country have sent letters to the Twins ' doctors saying they have had problems similar to Eisenreich 's and wishing him luck . Even opponents are rooting for him . " Everyone on this club hopes he can overcome it , " Tiger catcher Lance Parrish says , " because he 's a good ballplayer . I do n't think it 's anything to make fun of . Everyone can appreciate what he 's going through . Everyone knows the pressure of being up here . "
