Bystanders stared in wonder last summer as the fleet of 20 midnight-blue Cadillacs arrived in downtown Peking amid the clutter of buses and bicycles . The limousines , complete with built-in bars and TV sets , were the newest showpiece of an enterprise that is as remarkable in China as the luxury cars . Known as China International Trust and Investment Corporation , the state-owned firm woos foreign investors with a combination of savvy , sizzle and shrewd business skill . Said CITIC Chairman Rong Yiren , as he took delivery of the first Cadillacs to be acquired by a Chinese organization since the Communists came to power in 1949 : " Our foreign guests want to have comfortable limousines . " <P> CITIC is an elite concern formed in 1979 on the personal order of Deng Xiaoping . He proposed a kind of Western investment banking firm to get around the ponderous Peking bureaucracy and speed China 's economic development . Led by Rong , 70 , a silver-haired millionaire , the organization has helped foreign companies invest in everything from beer production to coal mining and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CITIC is a breath of fresh air , " says Virginia Kamsky , president of Kamsky Associates , a trade consultant with offices in New York and Peking . " The people there ask the right kinds of questions when you present a project , and when you talk about return on investment they understand what you mean . " <P> CITIC owes much of its style and substance to Rong , whose own history parallels China 's recent twists and turns . A Shanghai industrialist and deputy mayor of that city , Rong watched the nationalization of his factories after the Communist takeover . He and his wife were beaten by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s , his Shanghai home was expropriated , and he was forced to clean latrines . After spending the next decade in obscurity , Rong was publicly rehabilitated in the late 1970s . He now lives in a comfortable Peking house and is tended by servants . Says he : " For a long time I have held the view that those methods that are used in capitalist enterprises can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To achieve the union of the two systems , Rong assembled an executive staff of former businessmen and talented young technocrats . " We study the market before we pick a project , " says Jin Xuping , 67 , one of CITIC 'S two executive directors . Jin learned capitalist methods before 1949 while working in a family-owned group of insurance , oil and tobacco companies . Sent to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution , he grew vegetables and endured endless hours of political harangue . <P> After it was created in 1979 , CITIC promptly set out to find new ways of doing business in China . Instead of investing only in projects that were part of Peking 's Five-Year Plan , the innovative agency roamed the country in search of profitable opportunities wherever they might be found . Noting a growing demand for beer , CITIC created a $30 million joint venture with Japan 's Suntory to expand production . The initial results were so encouraging that output will be doubled during the next two years .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
