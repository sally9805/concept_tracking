In a period when many newspapers feel that their readers do n't love them , the increase in libel suits and costly verdicts may seem further evidence of reader ( and juror ) dissatisfaction . But the situation may not be all that bad . <P> Concerned about the credibility of the press , the American Society of Newspaper Editors in a poll of readers found that about two out of three consider their local paper reliable . But perhaps the most telling reader criticism was a feeling that reporters are too intent on " getting a good story and do n't worry much about hurting people . " People feeling hurt is what makes libel suits . <P> Some recent large libel awards against newspapers do not reflect an increased animus toward the press , in the opinion of Robert Sack , a libel attorney who represents the Wall Street Journal . He thinks that jurors get used to reading about large awards in injury or malpractice cases . Libel suits rarely show out-of-pocket losses , but " when the question turns on how much a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round numbers will come to the juror 's mind . " What made a $50 million libel suit against the Boston Globe remarkable last week was a verdict that found five paragraphs of a story false and defamatory , but the " gist " of it true , and awarded no damages . <P> Even when fending off costly verdicts , newspapers are apt to feel besmirched by libel trials . The prudent course would be to mollify an aggrieved party before he sues , but just the opposite usually happens : a person who calls a newspaper to ask for a retraction or a correction finds his call impatiently shunted around the newsroom by people busy getting out the next edition . He was hurt and upset when he placed the call ; when he hangs up he is angry and ready to sue . What began as a " golden opportunity for the press " ends up as one for a lawyer . This is the conclusion of three professors at the University of Iowa after studying nearly 900 libel suits filed over a ten-year period . <P> Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued Gilbert Cranberg , Gallup professor of journalism at Iowa , summarizing the Iowa study at a convention of the Organization of News Ombudsmen in Minneapolis . The ombudsman , clumsy title and all , is usually an older editorial hand delegated to hear out and judge reader complaints . This can be a touchy assignment . Since he was not involved in the original story and does not feel defensive about it , he may be readier to recommend a correction or even an apology . Though there are about 1,800 daily newspapers in the U.S. and Canada , there are only 35 ombudsmen . Now that they have proved valuable in warding off libel suits , their number may increase . <P> Those who sue are not primarily after a lot of money , the Iowa study showed ( though their lawyers , often hired for a contingency fee , ask for large sums ) . They sue " to correct the record and to get even . " Most tend to be public officials highly visible in their community . Their chance of winning in court is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want vindication .
