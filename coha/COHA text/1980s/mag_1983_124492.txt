In the cold of an early spring morning , Clayton Weishuhn comes out of his house and climbs into the cab of his big , sod-busting tractor . It 's not quite six o'clock and the sun 's not up , but in the pale light of the coming dawn Weishuhn does n't bother with the headlights . He gets the powerful diesel motor running and then heads the tractor out to work in the cotton fields of his father 's farm . // Now there is nothing unique about this in the small farming town of Wall . In this west Texas community of about 700 people there are probably 50 other farmers doing the same thing . However , there is one interesting difference : The rest are full-time cotton farmers ; Weishuhn doubles as a starting inside linebacker for the New England Patriots. // Make no mistake , though . Cotton farming is not merely a hobby with Weishuhn ; it 's his first calling . He has been a professional football player for only one year ; he has been a professional cotton farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got his first crop loan from the bank . He likes to play football ; he loves to farm cotton  --  loves it to the point that only in his senior year at Angelo State in San Angelo , Texas did Weishuhn decide he would play in the NFL if drafted . // Weishuhn is 6 ' 2 " and 220 pounds . He looks much bigger . Maybe that 's because he 's all arms and chest and thighs and neck , the result of years of farm work . At the moment he does n't own an acre of land of his own , and the dream of his life is to have a big spread . He helps work his father 's 1,000 acres and with his brother Darryl has leased 260 acres near Waco . On this day he plows his father 's fields until noon and then comes in for lunch . He and his wife , Diane , live in a white frame house set in the middle of the flat , black lands of the Concho Basin . The fields come right up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane has lunch ready for Clayton and a visitor . It 's Ash Wednesday , and the Weishuhns , who are devout Catholics , are eating fish . Diane has fixed two large T-bone steaks for the visitor , who immediately declines the second . Diane says , " Oh , I guess I 'm so used to Clayton and the way he eats . " // Like her husband , Diane is 23 . They were high school and college sweethearts and were married in their sophomore year at Angelo State . She used to be a gymnast , but now she 's well into her first pregnancy  --  a girl named Brandi Kate would be born on June 3  --  and has given up the sport for a time . // The house they are eating lunch in is the one in which Clayton grew up . It belongs to his father . It 's a comfortable but unpretentious place with two bedrooms and a metal roof . In the living room a gas fire is burning and the TV is tuned to a soap opera . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cotton fields of the Concho Basin , which was settled largely by German immigrants in the mid-19th century , stretch to the horizon , as flat as a billiard table . Trees are scarce and are to be found mostly around the farmhouses which themselves are far apart , separated by thousands of acres of cotton and maize fields . The area is crisscrossed by a number of dead-straight farm-to-market roads . The village of Wall is little more than a store and a school and a post office . It is a typical farming area , and its life seems an unlikely one for a talented young athlete to choose over a career in pro football . // But Weishuhn almost did . As early as his junior year in college the pros were scouting him , and their most immediate concern was n't could he make it , but would he sign if drafted . Jerry Vandergriff , who as an assistant coach at Angelo State recruited Weishuhn and is now head coach there , says , " The story was already out on Clayton . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only 10 miles from Wall . I mean , every big school in the country had been trying to recruit him , but he wanted to come here so he could go home every evening and farm . So the scouts just were n't sure , and they were afraid to waste a high draft pick . And I could n't tell them what Clayton was going to do because I did n't know . " // " We lay awake many nights talking about it , " Diane says , " talking about what we really wanted . We knew we loved to farm . We just did n't know about the football and moving so far away . " // So what 's the big attraction in farming cotton ? // Weishuhn , who 's specific and articulate when talking about the mechanics of farming , has trouble explaining his feelings for it . After thinking a moment , he says , " Well , farming is outside work and I love that . " Then he stops and laughs . " But I guess football is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farming is strenuous work . From the spring plowing on through the planting , the irrigating , the cultivating and the harvesting , it requires 12- and 14- and 16-hour days . " Lots of nights I 've been out on that tractor until midnight , " Weishuhn says . " Then up the next morning at six . But I 've worked hard all my life and I like it . " // He is sitting on the couch in the Weishuhns ' small living room . He uses snuff , and he pauses to spit in a plastic cup Diane has brought him . " As a matter of fact , " he says , " one of the things that bothered me when we were living up in Massachusetts last year was that I 'd be home from practice by six o'clock and then there 'd be nothing to do . That 's when I 'd miss being back here the most . We lived in a little place , a kind of suburb of Foxboro , and there was a dairy farm right across from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and just look at it . " // " Sometimes , " says Diane , " he 'd go over and smell the dirt in the pasture there . " // He 'd do what ? // Clayton grins . " Aw , I did n't do that but once , " he says . " I just wanted to see if they had as good a dirt as we have here in Wall . They don't. " // " He 's always walking out in the fields around here and on the land we lease up near Waco and picking up a handful of dirt and smelling it and tasting it and feeling it , " Diane says . // " Why not ? " Clayton says proudly . " Listen , my daddy can pick up a handful of dirt and damn near tell you as much about it as one of those soil analyses they do up there at Texas A&amp;M. " // Diane stops on her way out to the kitchen . " See , that 's it , " she says . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your blood . It 's all that Clayton and I have known . Farming and Wall . And the people around here . " // It has turned into a beautiful afternoon , bright and sunny . Weishuhn and the visitor move outside and sit on the front porch . " Hell , we ought to be fishing today , " Weishuhn says , " or plowing . " He gives his visitor a sidelong look . " Instead of sitting in the house talking . " // Then he yells in through the screen door , " Hey , Diane ! Hey , honey ? How about bringing the two of us a beer out here . Sandstorm might blow up and we could both die of thirst before we could get back inside of the house . " // Moments later , sipping at a beer , he says thoughtfully , " Thing I missed last year more than anything else was stripping my cotton . Harvest is the best time for a farmer . That 's the payoff . But you strip cotton in the fall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family got my crop in for me . " He laughs . " That 's why I 'm working my daddy 's place right now as well as the land I lease , to pay him back for last harvest time . // " You ride along on that combine and look over your shoulder and see that cotton going into the trailer you 're pulling , and it gives you a good feeling . You spend the day watching it pile up until that big trailer is full , and you say , ' Hey , I planted those seeds six months ago . I must have done something right because look what I got now . ' " // Suddenly he stands up and calls in to Diane through the screen door , " Hey , honey , we 're going riding around . Be back in a little while . " // " I thought you were going to spade up a vegetable garden for me this afternoon , " she yells back . // Weishuhn starts toward the pickup in a hurry . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Driving away he hits the steering wheel with his big , thick hand and laughs . " Dang , I love it here ! " // Football has always taken a backseat to farming for Weishuhn . Says Mike Martin , his linebacker coach at Angelo State , " We had Clayton 's academic schedule set up so he only had classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays . The rest of the time , except for games , he 'd be farming . He 'd come dragging in here for practice with dirt under his fingernails and smelling like diesel fuel , and I knew he 'd either been under a tractor or on one since dawn . " // But then if he loves farming so much , why bother with football at all ? Is it just for the money ? // Driving , Weishuhn glances sideways at his questioner and his face hardens . " Listen , " he says , " do n't get me wrong . I love to play football and I dang well meant to prove that I could play football in the NFL. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a careless air of geniality that when he turns serious his words carry weight . His mouth sets and his eyes narrow , and it 's not hard to imagine how he looks when he positions himself to hit a running back coming through a hole . // And when Weishuhn hits a ballcarrier , he stays hit . He 's no borderline NFL player . He was a third-round pick of the Patriots last year , and even though his rookie season was shortened by the strike , he made a name for himself with his quickness and aggressiveness and his knack for getting to the ball . Larry Peccatiello , the Washington Redskins ' linebacker coach , says , " Clayton Weishuhn . What a player ! What a kid ! When they first started telling me about him , I thought he was a little light for an inside linebacker . Then I saw him in the Olympic Gold Bowl a postseason all-star game for college seniors where he was the defensive MVP . On one play he got knocked down by a cut block on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of scrimmage . I think he 's the most exciting young linebacker I 've ever seen . I think we 're talking about another Lee Roy Jordan . " // Speaking of Weishuhn 's aggressiveness , Martin , his Angelo State coach , says , " We get a lot of players in here that do n't know ' come here ' from ' sic ' em . ' Believe me , when Clayton got here he sure knew what ' sic ' em ' meant . " // Among the Pats , Weishuhn was second only to the other inside linebacker , Steve Nelson , in total tackles ; he led the New England team in unassisted stops with 48 . Against the Steelers he had 25 tackles , 10 of them unassisted and in all but two games he had more than 12 tackles . Says John Hannah , New England 's recently retired All-Pro guard , " Clayton 's going to be a great one . He 's hell to shut out of a play . " // Given all that , it seems unbelievable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of cotton farming . But his agent , Joe Courrege , insists Weishuhn was n't kidding . " He 's a young man who knows what he wants , " says Courrege . " When I sat down to negotiate with New England I told them that Clayton had certain requirements , and if he did n't get them , he was going to stay down on the farm . " He pauses , as if not quite sure he believes what he 's about to say . " This was before the USFL came along , so in talking contract you normally would hold the Canadian Football League over the NFL team 's head . But I was threatening the Patriots with cotton farming as our alternative if they did n't meet our terms . I do n't think that 's ever happened before . " // Weishuhn was the 60th player picked in the 1981 draft . Courrege says a lot of teams made a mistake in not drafting him sooner . " Oh , there were some clubs who were worried about his weight , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afraid to waste a high choice because they feared Clayton would n't report . But two months before the draft he was saying in a loud , clear voice he 'd play for whoever drafted him , provided they offered a reasonable deal . They just were n't listening . " // Even the all-knowing Dallas Cowboy organization admits to having made a mistake . The Cowboys had a chance to draft Weishuhn seven picks before he was taken by New England , but they passed him up in favor of another linebacker , Yale 's Jeff Rohrer , who spent most of last season on the sidelines . Gil Brandt , the director of personnel development for the Cowboys , says , " Yeah , we were wrong about Clayton . We can measure height and weight and speed , but we do n't have a computer that measures heart and character , and that kid 's got a bunch . We should have drafted him . " // Of course , it 's no secret why Weishuhn is playing pro football . " We thought about it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that the time we spent away from Wall would be worth it if we could get what we want . " // What they want is farmland . Acquiring it is n't easy . Good irrigated land in West Texas goes for about $1,400 an acre . Then there 's the expense of equipment . Clayton , his father and Darryl own six tractors among them , and each costs $40,000 or more . The family jointly owns a combine , which goes for $80,000. // So cotton farming is a very expensive business to get into . You either have to inherit the land , which Weishuhn is n't likely to do any time soon , or be able to make a lot of money in a hurry . For Weishuhn , quick bucks constitute the big appeal of pro football . Even third-round draft choices get a pretty good piece of change as a signing bonus ; Weishuhn received a reported $100,000 as part of a four-year , $500,000 package . There 's no evidence of lavish spending around the Weishuhn house . No Mercedes sits out front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no new furniture , no additions to the house . And in Foxboro the Weishuhns live in a place that 's rented right down to the furniture . Clearly , every penny above living expenses is being saved to buy land . " Every farmer wants his own land , " he says . // In 1926 , Weishuhn 's paternal grandfather bought land in the Concho basin and the Weishuhns have lived there ever since . So has Diane 's family . Clayton has two other brothers and a sister . Doyle , 17 , the youngest brother , is still in high school , but the other two , Darryl , 27 , and Carl , 22 , farm cotton . ( Lisa , 26 , works for a steel company in San Angelo . ) Everyone in Wall says Darryl would have been a better football player than Clayton , but Darryl quit at Angelo State after his freshman year to return full time to the farm . Clayton almost did the same , but he was talked out of it by then Angelo State Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed Clayton how he could get what he wanted through football , that he ought not to waste that natural talent . " // " What Coach Hess said was right , " says Weishuhn . " But football or no football , I 'll have me my own farm someday . " // Weishuhn is asked if there 's any parallel between himself and a black trying to get out of the ghetto by becoming a prizefighter. // Clayton pulls his head back and looks at the visitor as if he 's lost his mind . " Ghetto ? " he says . " Hell , I ai n't trying to get out of Wall , I 'm trying to stay here . " // He laughs . " Do you know there were better than a thousand people at me and Diane 's wedding , " he says . " Her daddy is known all over this part of the country as one of the best barbecue cooks in the world . He was barbecuing two days before the wedding . God knows how many pounds of meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I do n't know how many kegs of beer were bought . But everybody else brought all the side dishes . Potato salad , you know , and beans and cole slaw and bread and pies and cakes . I think the party lasted three days . Diane and I left the first day , but it went on after that . " // Weishuhn pulls his pickup off to the side of a country road and points out the windshield . The land stretches black and flat to the horizon . " You see that ? " he says , pointing to meticulously plowed fields . " Well , when I was 12 my daddy put me on a tractor and said , ' Go to it . ' You got any idea how hard it is to plow a straight furrow in all that out there ? I 'll tell you . It ai n't easy . About two years after I give it my first try I was able to do it . I remember when I come in and my daddy went out and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted me on the shoulder and said he believed I 'd make a farmer . " // He spits out the window and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand . " I 'll tell you , " he says , " I 've had some awards for playing football and I 'm dang proud of ' em . But I ai n't never been prouder of anything than what my daddy said to me that day . " // During the drive , Weishuhn meets a number of neighbors , also in pickups , along the road . He stops to visit with each one . Most of the talk is about farming , but one friend says Weishuhn is n't going to get in shape for next football season riding around in a pickup . " Yeah , I am , " he says . " I just put one gallon of gas in , and when that runs out , I pick up the truck and carry it home . " // Later in the afternoon , Clayton and Darryl are summoned to their parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The refrigerator is on the blink , and Clayton 's dad , Olan , wants his two sons to put it in the back of his pickup so he can take it to the dealer and get it fixed . Olan is a tall , well-built , quiet man in his middle 50s whose physique makes it clear how his boys got their strength . Clayton 's mother , Marlene , is a plump housewife who laughs a great deal and is said to be able to dance half the men in the county off their feet . // The refrigerator is the size a farm mother with four growing sons and a daughter to feed would have in her kitchen . It must weigh 350 pounds . Olan has recently had a back operation , so his only role in this task is providing a dolly for moving the refrigerator . As Clayton and Darryl approach the refrigerator , Olan says , with a trace of a German accent , " Now , you boys , you use dat dolly . Do n't get down in your back like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 6 ' 4 " and 235 pounds Darryl is as strong as Clayton , and they simply pick the refrigerator up as if it were a sack of potatoes , walk it through several rooms and out the front door , then set it in the bed of their father 's pickup . // While that is being done , Olan is asked if Clayton will change , if the glamour of the NFL will get to him . Olan says , gravely , " I tell dat boy , you let your neck get bigger , not your head . " // Back at his house Clayton relaxes on the couch while Diane brings him another plastic cup and says , about the snuff , " He 's going to lose his lip one of these days . " She asks again when he 's going to spade her up a vegetable garden . " Aw , you 're pregnant , " he says . " You do n't need to be working in a garden . " // " Some farmer , " she says . // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talk , resigned now to the fact that he wo n't be able to get in any more plowing . Besides , he has to fly to Boston the next day to accept a Patriot Rookie of the Year award from the Pats ' booster club . // " You know what 's funny ? " he says . " Sometimes I 'll be riding along on that tractor and I 'll look down at the cotton and think , dang , some guy in England might someday be wearing a shirt made out of this very cotton I 'm growing here . Or maybe it 'll be part of a sheet for somebody 's bed in Tokyo . I guess they use sheets in Japan . " // He wrinkles his brow , still trying to explain the appeal of Wall  --  why he gave serious thought to passing up pro football in favor of staying down on the farm . " It 's not just the farming , " he says . " A lot of it is the quality of life here in Wall . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like two or three nights a week people will come by or we 'll go over to their house and play dominoes . And these are all people you grew up with . They know you and you know them . So you do n't have to do a lot of explaining about yourself , because they already know . Man , do you know that most of those folks in Foxboro never even heard of Moon or Forty-two which are domino games ? That 's the kind of stuff I 'm talking about . " // And it 's other things . It 's going down to the cotton gin on rainy mornings and drinking coffee and talking shop with the other farmers . It 's the informal life in Wall , where Weishuhn can drive up unannounced in anyone 's front yard and the door will pop open and he 'll get a warm greeting before he even gets out of his pickup . It 's the feeling of knowing exactly who he is and where he is and the importance of what he 's doing . // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Weishuhn and his father and his brothers are out in the fields and Diane and Marlene and his brothers ' wives bring lunch out to them . And they get off their tractors and gather around the bed of a pickup and eat and laugh and talk . // It 's the dances he and Diane go to at the community hall of the Catholic church . It 's being able to take off and go fishing of an afternoon whenever he wants . // " It 's , well , it 's knowing what 's important , " Weishuhn says . " Not what everybody else might think is important , but what you know is important . " // Priorities . When Weishuhn made Division II All-America the people at Angelo State had a hard time locating him . They finally found him on his dad 's farm underneath a tractor working on its innards . When he was given the news he said , " Hey , that 's good , is n't it ? " Then he went back to working on the tractor . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of their TVs watching the proceedings on ESPN , Weishuhn was out in the fields . Darryl finally had to run out there to tell him he 'd been selected . // Then last season the player strike cost Weishuhn a bundle in unpaid salary . Asked how much , he just ducks his head and says , " Several acres . " Clearly , Olan need n't concern himself about Clayton 's head getting any bigger . But NFL running backs ought to worry about his neck getting bigger . They could be standing in the way of farmland . And that 's not a safe position . Weishuhn still understands " sic ' em . "
