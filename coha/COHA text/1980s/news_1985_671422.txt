Whether the younger politicians can succeed is problematical. // But by presenting a challenge they are forcing their elders in the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party to come to grips with an inevitability they have resisted - that once the incumbent Prime Minister , Yasuhiro Nakasone , leaves office , probably next year , the old guard will start to lose control. // " A change in generations is a current of the times , " Shin Kanemaru , the party ' s powerful secretary general , said recently. // // ' Young ' Means 60 // In the Japanese political context , young means 60 years old . That may not seem much more youthful than the present crop of leaders , such as Mr. Nakasone , who is 66. // But these slightly younger men are perceived by Japanese as a new generation , having entered politics for the most part in the 1950 ' s , a full step behind Mr. Nakasone and his contemporaries , who started their careers right after World War II . Increasingly , the younger group is showing impatience over having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside. // Nowhere has the generational division been more graphically displayed than in the Liberal Democratic machine headed by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka , who is also 66 years old. // Late Wednesday night Mr. Tanaka was hospitalized after suffering what one doctor described as a " very slight stroke . " It was the third hospital stay for Mr. Tanaka in the last four years , and if his condition this time is judged to be serious the consequences for Japanese politics could be profound , especially for Mr. Nakasone , who owes his office to Mr. Tanaka ' s support. // Mr. Tanaka , despite having been found guilty two years ago of bribe-taking , has remained Japan ' s kingmaker by virtue of heading the largest of the dominant party ' s five major factions . But in the last few weeks potentially serious cracks have developed in what many had thought to be an invincible machine . <> <> Aspirant Offers Challenge // A challenge was thrown down by one of Mr. Tanaka ' s followers , Noboru Takeshita , the 60-year-old Finance Minister and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister. // Mr. Takeshita ' s problem is that his ambitions are effectively blocked so long as Mr. Tanaka hangs on as the faction leader . And since the former Prime Minister has shown no interest in yielding power , especially while he is appealing his conviction , Mr. Takeshita felt himself forced to take matters into his own hands. // In effect , he rebelled. // Early this month , he enlisted 40 other relatively young , disgruntled members of the Tanaka faction . Together , they formed a " study group , " the main goal of which was to support Mr. Takeshita ' s future candidacy for party president and , by extension , for Prime Minister. // The group , known as Soseikai , could have been twice as large , but the Finance Minister deliberately kept it small in a spirit of compromise . Even so , Mr. Tanaka , who is often referred to as " the old man " by supporters , grew furious. // But when it became clear that he could not stop his impatient disciples , he announced that the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible wide breach , at least for now . <> <> A Setback for Kingmaker Many political analysts concluded that the kingmaker had suffered a blow . However , it was far too early to say that the resourceful Mr. Tanaka ' s political dominance was over . In fact , even after the Takeshita maneuver , two unaffiliated Liberal Democratic members of Parliament said they wanted to join the Tanaka faction. // In the meantime , other relatively young politicians who also hope to become Prime Minister have given Mr. Takeshita moral support . Most conspicuous among these is Shintaro Abe , the 60-year-old Foreign Minister . Like Mr. Takeshita , he has been held back by a powerful faction leader - another former Prime Minister , the 80-year-old Takeo Fukuda. // Trapped in the same way is yet one more would-be Prime Minister , Kiichi Miyazawa , who can not advance while his faction remains in the hands of former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki. // " All these younger men are rivals , " a university political scientist said . " But unless they can displace the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have a common interest . " <> <> Ideology Matters Little // To outsiders , all of this often seems nothing more than a bewildering array of unfamiliar names , deep-seated grudges and personal ambitions . That can be an accurate perception . Within the Liberal Democratic Party , the sole source of true political power , ideological convictions arise about as often as they do among old-fashioned ward- heelers in the big American cities. // Nevertheless , as feudal as the system may appear , that is the way Japan chooses the person who presides over the second most powerful economy in the non-Communist world . One of the three so-called " new leaders " - Messrs . Takeshita , Abe and Miyazawa - is likely to follow Mr. Nakasone as Prime Minister. // Some political analysts argue that the generational split within the Tanaka faction has benefited Mr. Nakasone by neutralizing possible rivals before the scheduled expiration of his term as party president in November 1986 . <> <> Premier ' s Faction Is Small // But others say that any kind of division must worry him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s full support , his grip on power would be tenuous. // There had been speculation that the Prime Minister would call parliamentary elections this year in hope of strengthening his hand , but that prospect seems dimmer now. // There had also been talk that Mr. Tanaka might try to change party rules to allow his contemporary , Mr. Nakasone , to stay on for an extra year , until late 1987 . The generational divisions among the Liberal Democrats make it doubtful now that the party would endorse such a proposal. // //
