If you ca n't kill a Government program , why not milk it ? That , it seems , was the attitude of some officials who had failed to persuade Congress to stop spending some $200 million a year on fixing up run-down apartments and making them available to the poor with the help of federal rent subsidies . A report by Paul Adams , inspector general of Housing and Urban Development , suggests that the most effective way to get a housing project approved under President Reagan 's HUD Secretary , Samuel Pierce , was for the developer to hire a prominent Republican as a " consultant " and pay him a substantial fee . <P> The most notable example was that of James Watt , former Interior Secretary and bete noire of environmentalists everywhere . He got $300,000 to help a developer get 312 units of such housing started in Essex , Md. , in 1986 . His " minimal " role , according to the report , was " to convince the right people that the projects were good and were needed . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General , John Mitchell , who has since died ; former Massachusetts Senator Edward Brooke ; former Kentucky Governor Louie Nunn ; Philip Winn , current U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland ; and Frederick Bush , a close associate , but no relative , of President Bush 's . Jack Kemp , the President 's new HUD Secretary , has ordered the program stopped until recent grants are reviewed and new approval procedures created .
