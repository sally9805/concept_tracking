College football 's most famous running back is 13 inches tall and weighs 25 pounds . He 's hard to bring down because he has a pretty mean stiff-arm and is made of solid bronze . He is , of course , the Heisman Trophy , which goes each season to the man voted the game 's outstanding player . Heisman time is here again , and for the past two weeks ballots from 1,050 writers and broadcasters , many of whom know something about football , have been arriving at the offices of Harris , Kerr , Forster &amp; Co. , certified public accountants , in New York City . // Shortly after noon on Monday , Dec. 1 the final tally will be hand-carried to the Downtown Athletic Club , which founded the award in 1935 and has sponsored it ever since . Minutes later , Carmine Ragucci , the DAC 's Heisman chairman , will pick up his telephone and call  --  well , no one can be sure just whom . Here are the leading candidates : // George Rogers , South Carolina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winners have come from the likes of the Pac-10 and Big Eight , or from among notable independents like Notre Dame , Penn State and Pitt . South Carolina lacks a great football heritage . Also , no southern black has ever won , largely because , until about 1965 , blacks were n't recruited by the major football schools in the South . // Rogers began to stake his Heisman claim last season , when he rushed for 1,681 yards  --  second only to USC 's Charles White . South Carolina won eight games , the most in its history . This season the Fighting Gamecocks once again have eight victories . Credit Rogers , a one-man offense . Although South Carolina was upset 27-6 by Clemson last Saturday , Rogers banged out 168 yards in 28 carries , his 21st consecutive 100-yard game . He has gained 1,781 yards this season and is the leading runner in the country . So were the last four Heisman winners . // Rogers was a long shot in the preseason Heisman sweepstakes . His talents had never been showcased on national television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tube is a must . All winners since 1967 have played in at least one nationally televised game . And though Rogers was second to White in rushing , in the Heisman voting he was seventh  --  behind Ohio State 's glamour quarterback , Art Schlichter and just ahead of Purdue 's Mark Herrmann , both back this fall . Because South Carolina faced such powerhouses as Georgia , USC and Michigan , it trumpeted that fact to emphasize that Rogers was n't getting his yards against patsies . But because the schedule also included Pacific , Wichita State , Cincinnati and The Citadel , the rugged-opponent argument did n't wash . // Rogers promoted himself by gaining more yards against USC ( 141 ) and Michigan ( 142 ) than he did against Cincinnati ( 128 ) and Wichita State ( 108 ) . And when the Georgia game was shown on national TV , Rogers ran for 168 yards . The trouble was , Bulldog freshman Herschel Walker had more ( 219 ) , including a glittering 76-yard touchdown run , and Georgia won . What might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 . But remember , two years ago Oklahoma 's Billy Sims made a similar fumble that cost the Sooners a possible national title and gave Nebraska a tie for the Big Eight championship . And he still won the Heisman . Rogers should do so , too . // Herschel Walker , Georgia . One intangible going for Walker is his name . Consider these past winners : Nile Kinnick , Angelo Bertelli , O.J. Simpson , Archie Griffin and  --  yes  --  Doak Walker . A Jim Walker gets no easy votes . A Herschel Walker might . // But Walker has credentials , too . He is fourth in the nation in rushing with 1,411 yards through 10 games . If he hits his average ( 141.1 ) this week against Georgia Tech , he 'll have 1,552  --  second only to Tony Dorsett among freshmen runners . Project Walker 's average over a 44-game career and it comes to 6,208  --  surpassing Dorsett 's record 6,082. // Walker is 6 ' 2 " tall , weighs 220 pounds and has 4.3 speed . Without him last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically the same Bulldog team is 10-0 and ranked No. 1 . Besides the televised game against South Carolina , Walker was on the next week against Florida , when he ran 72 yards for a touchdown . The two TV appearances came at what might be called Heisman prime time , the first two weeks in November , a definite plus . // If the Bulldogs beat Tech  --  and they will be heavy favorites to do so  --  they will need only one more victory , over Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl , to nail down the national championship . Nineteen of the 45 Heisman winners played either on undefeated teams or teams that won some kind of mythical national championship . // Now for a definite minus . Only six juniors  --  Doc Blanchard in 1945 , Doak Walker in 1948 , Vic Janowicz in 1950 , Roger Staubach in 1963 , Griffin in 1974 and Sims in 1978  --  have won the trophy . No sophomore has ever won . Nor has a freshman . In fact , not one has ever been among the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voters still think a player must prove himself in more than one season . Bet on Walker to finish second . // Hugh Green , Pittsburgh . The 6 ' 2 " , 222-pound senior defensive end-linebacker is a two-time consensus All-America , certain to be a three-timer , and is easily the best defender on the nation 's best defense . But when it comes to glory , defense always comes in second . After the season Pitt will retire Green 's number , but how many people outside Pittsburgh know what that number is ? // In four seasons Green has made 269 solo tackles and helped out on another 177 . He has nailed quarterbacks 53 times  --  for a total of  --  374 yards . He 's done it despite incessant double- and triple-teaming and an inordinate number of plays that go the other way . Largely because of Green , Pitt is 9-1 and ranked in the Top 10 for the third year in Green 's four seasons . // He has an obvious zest for his job . " On defense , all we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder the next time , " he says . " Offense is more for the witty and brainy types . Me , if I do n't crush somebody on a play , I 'm disappointed . " To alert voters to Green , Pitt sports information director Dean Billick recently mailed to writers and broadcasters across the land some 2,500 2 ' by 3 ' four-color posters of Green with capsule raves from the critics . But such Academy Award-type tactics may alienate more voters than they persuade . And no strictly defensive lineman has ever won a Heisman , although a pair of two-way players have  --  Yale End Larry Kelley in 1936 and Notre Dame End Leon Hart in 1949 . Look for Green to finish third . // Art Schlichter , Ohio State . The preseason Heisman favorite , Schlichter was fourth as a sophomore in last year 's voting and this fall seemed to have a lock . Good team , good position , good looks . A passing cover boy . He started fast , as did the Buckeyes , but then came a televised encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unbeatens . UCLA won and Schlichter was shut out , 17-0 . He was intercepted , sacked a half-dozen times and completed only five of 12 passes for 59 yards  --  his worst performance ever . He looked equally inept last week as Ohio State lost to Michigan 9-3 , but it really did n't matter . He was already a loser . // Mark Herrmann , Purdue . The 6 ' 5 " , 194-pound senior quarterback 's claim is his four-year record . As a freshman he passed for 2,453 yards , the next year he threw for 1,904 and last year it was 2,377 . Herrmann has added another 2,923 yards this season , increasing his career total to 9,657 yards . He has broken the NCAA major college record of 7,818 yards set by Jack Thompson of Washington State in 1975-78 . But Herrmann 's 17 interceptions this season brought his career total to 75 , which also broke an NCAA record . Like Schlichter , Herrmann was done in on TV . Purdue had two national appearances . In its first , against Notre Dame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turned out , he was better off in that game than in the second . That came two weeks ago against Michigan , and Herrmann completed 21 of 34 passes , but for only 129 yards while being intercepted four times in a 26-0 Boilermaker defeat . // Neil Lomax , Portland State . As far as voters are concerned , there may be no Neil Lomax , only some enterprising young sports information director who mails in stats each week that seem to read like who has seen him in action ? Also , many voters may not realize that although the Vikings are a Division I-AA team , its players are eligible for the Heisman . Consequently Lomax , who probably will be the No. 1 pro draft pick , has no more chance than did a blond quarterback from Louisiana Tech in 1969 ; name of Terry Bradshaw . // Freeman McNeil and Ken Easley , UCLA . When a team is pushing two Heisman candidates , it 's like the coach who says he has four equal quarterbacks ; it means he has none . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McNeil has gained 100 yards or more in each of the seven games he has played this season  --  and has had 25 100-yard afternoons in a row . Easley is the best free safety in the country . Both looked good on television this season . But in this case one plus one equals zero . To make it tougher , USC Tailback Marcus Allen will draw some West Coast votes . // Jim McMahon , Brigham Young . The junior quarterback has gargantuan passing stats , but this season so many quarterbacks are completing so many passes for so many yards and so many touchdowns , they tend to cancel each other . Scratch McMahon . Ditto Stanford 's John Elway and Illinois ' Dave Wilson . // Those are the leading contenders . And here 's one more number of interest , especially for Carmine Ragucci of the DAC . It 's 803 . That 's the area code for Columbia , S.C .
