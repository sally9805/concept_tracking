Mikhail Gorbachev has a nightmare , and it keeps coming true . In various corners of the world 's last empire , demonstrators wave placards , some of them bearing Gorbachev 's portrait ; they hurl slogans , including some he made famous ; they taunt troops , all of whom he commands from Moscow . Shouts lead to shots , and a riot becomes an enactment of Gorbachev 's greatest dilemma : the relaxation of control can also mean disorder , which in turn can provoke repression , reversing reform and jeopardizing the political survival of the reformer . Last week it happened in Tbilisi . Next week , or next month , it could happen outside the borders of the U.S.S.R. but still within the empire , in Warsaw , Budapest , Prague , East Berlin . Western statesmen have their own dilemma . A crisis in the East , especially if it seemed to be fanned by the West , could play into the hands of Gorbachev 's conservative opponents and trigger a crackdown . <P> Henry Kissinger has been trying to persuade the Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Soviet Union would commit itself to tolerate political and economic pluralism in Eastern Europe in exchange for Western guarantees of Soviet military security . The notion seems to be that Moscow might be more likely to allow Poland , Hungary and other countries to evolve toward democracy and free markets , perhaps even to associate themselves with the European Community , if NATO promises not to lure them out of the Warsaw Pact and perhaps desists from covert intelligence operations behind the Iron Curtain . <P> Critics have stigmatized the proposed deal as " Yalta II , " a repetition of Franklin Roosevelt 's unwitting sellout of Eastern Europe in 1945 . The State Department bureaucracy is unanimously ( though anonymously ) convinced that a superpower negotiation on the fate of Europe would offend the Europeans . Last month James Baker publicly floated the idea , without quite endorsing it . Sure enough , transatlantic cables poured into Foggy Bottom with protests and warnings . The British Ambassador in Washington sought , and received , assurances that the Administration was not embracing the plan . Last week Kissinger insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo it . His proposal , he says , is to provide Eastern Europe with the political breathing room to reintegrate with the West while depriving the Kremlin of a military pretext to interfere . <P> The furor is a curious sort of testament to Kissinger . Twelve years out of office , he still commands immense authority , especially in the absence of fresh ideas from official Washington ; the Bush Administration 's long-awaited " national-security review " of policy toward the U.S.S.R. has turned out to be a prescription for business as usual . But the Kissinger plan is fundamentally flawed . It seeks from the men in the Kremlin something they are already willing to grant  --  latitude for diversity and liberalization in the " fraternal " countries of Eastern Europe . And it offers in return assurances that have little to do with the Soviets ' real fears  --  political deterioration inside the bloc , not a military threat from outside . Moreover , the forces that stand ready to exploit the trouble are also internal , not external ; they are domestic hard-liners , not CIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
