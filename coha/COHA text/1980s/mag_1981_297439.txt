But serious defeats loom ahead on Capitol Hill <P> The presidential jeans were trim , the snakeskin boots glistened in the Sunday sun and the white knit tennis shirt clung flatteringly to Ronald Reagan 's chest . As he chatted with a few friends and reporters on the White House 's South Lawn , one newsman complimented him on his flat belly . Having a gym so handy in the White House really helped , said Reagan , adding with a proud grin , " Here , feel these triceps . " The reporter gingerly tested Reagan 's arm . The muscles were firm . Despite his chest wound and nearly nine months in the Oval Office , Reagan , at 70 , looks healthier than he did before his election . <P> His spirit , too , seems as jaunty as ever . At a White House screening of The French Lieutenant 's Woman , Reagan drew laughs from his guests with the deprecatory quip : " I tried to get Bedtime for Bonzo , but it was n't available .

" There 's a young lady , " he , said , " who 's really a pretty good reason for everything that we 're doing to see if this country wo n't be as good to her and her friends her age as it 's been to all of us .

He effectively displayed the contrasting piles of paper at the press conference . <P> Compared with his tentative and fumbling performance at a meeting with reporters in June , this one went well . Reagan easily fielded the surprisingly soft questions , sometimes reading from prepared answers , and nimbly ducked the few hard ones . His only gaffe came in a spontaneous reply to a reporter who wondered about the security risk in selling AWACS to a potentially unstable Saudi regime . Reagan snapped : " I have to say that Saudi Arabia we will not permit to be an Iran . " When asked the logical follow-up question on how the U.S. would intervene to prevent any domestic uprising against the Riyadh monarchy , Reagan recovered somewhat , putting the issue in a broader context of the Western world 's stake in protecting access to Middle East oil . Said he about Saudi Arabia : " There 's no way that we could stand by and see that taken over by anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muzzy statement , implying that the U.S. would defend the Saudi royal family against internal upheaval , underscored his-and the **26;9604;TOOLONG difficulty in handling foreign affairs . Both the articulation of policy and decision making have been quirky and halting .
