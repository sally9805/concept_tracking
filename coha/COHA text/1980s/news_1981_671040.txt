Waves of cultivated exiles , including thousands of Polish nationalists and some of the Decembrists , aristocrats who bungled a coup in 1825 , once gave the city a touch of culture and breeding , and even today Irkutsk takes pride in having one of the few organs in Siberia. // The city is now an attractive administrative center of about half a million residents , several institutions of higher education , an assortment of industries and a lovely park along the banks of the Angara River. // But a touch of the " Wild East " still lingers . A frequent sight at the airports and railroad stations here , like elsewhere in Siberia , are the tramps known as bichi . The name derives from " beachcomber , " but the popular explanation is that it comes from the Russian initials for " former intelligent person. " // // ' Nobody Asks Where You ' re From ' // Valentin Rasputin , the popular Siberian writer , described bichi as heavy drinkers , vagabonds who fled from the law , from grief , from alimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here seeking freedom and escape , " he said . " In the taiga , nobody asks where you ' re from. " // The taiga is that great stretch of forest and swamp across the Eurasian continent , that despite the rapid advance of civilization remains a wilderness where only two years ago newspapers reported that geologists stumbled across a tattered family of Old Believers - sectarians persecuted at every stage of Russian history - whose progenitor had fled into the bush during the civil war . The aged patriarch , his two ragged sons and two daughters had subsisted on the fruits of the forest and what they could scratch from the soil for more than 50 years. // A touch of the past died in Irkutsk on Nov. 29 , when the authorities ordered the legendary barakholka , or clothing flea market , shut . " We closed it because it fired speculative passions , " the deputy chief of the regional Communist Party organization , Leonid G. Pinko , said. // On the last day , only about 50 peddlers remained in the acre of outdoor stalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mr. Pinko meant : here were precious furs , including sable marked with Government stamps , thick homemade fur boots , imported shoes and sweaters , salves , jewelry and every variety of clothing , homemade or state-supplied , despite a well-worn board warning that only used clothing could be sold . <> <> A Lithuanian Woman ' s Diatribe // An old Lithuanian woman , asked why the place was being dismantled , broke into a distinctly subversive stream of invective . " Just ask yourself who benefits from this , " she said . " They want only the Government to get all the sales . Back in Lithuania when I was growing up it was all private shops and you could buy anything you want . Now you even have to sell the berries and nuts you gather to the Government. " // Rationing , known as the coupon system , went into effect in Irkutsk and some other Siberian cities in May after years of deteriorating supplies . Coupons issued by the housing authorities entitle each resident to 2. 2 pounds of meat and two-third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some grumbling at first . But it also simplified life for working people who could never get to the store until late in the day , by which time old women had stripped the stores bare. // In food shops along Karl Marx Street , the main avenue , the food and butter counters were the only ones without lines , and the products lay repackaged in the authorized amounts . In restaurants and cafes , meat seemed plentiful and unrationed . <> <> A Contrast With Moscow // The scene contrasted with that in shops in Moscow , where the arrival of meat or butter spawns instant lines . The contrast extended to the official approach to the problem - in Moscow , officials rarely acknowledge any shortages , no matter how obvious . Here , Mr. Pinko met the problem head-on : " Yes , we ' re on a coupon system because we don ' t produce enough meat and milk . Local farms supply only 60 percent of the meat we need , and 80 percent of our milk , and we don ' t get enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siberia , and Mr. Pinko said it remained an integral component of the Siberian character . " European traits are slow in reaching us , " he said , showing obvious distaste for whatever weaknesses he found in his Western cousins . His own grandfather , Mr. Pinko said , was a political exile under the czars , and a true Sibiryak was a man unafraid of hardships , persistent , taciturn and honest. // Siberia is a big land , and tales told here are correspondingly tall . There ' s the hunter who developed appendicitis and operated on himself , using deer gut for sutures . Or the builders of the Bratsk dam whose heads froze to their pillows at night and whose eyes bled from mosquito attacks . Or the year that berries grew badly and bears turned to eating meat , devouring 15 or 20 people in the process. // The latter tale was told by no ordinary hunter - Nikolai S. Sveridov has been an instructor in the lore of the hunt for almost 30 years at Irkutsk ' s Institute of Game Management , combining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bear . <> <> Repositories of Legend // Though properly collectivized and duly assigned five-year plans by the Soviet authorities , hunting and trapping remain staunch repositories of the romance and legend of siberia . It doesn ' t take much to get the Sibiryak to talk about his dog , his game and the lure of the taiga. // The serious hunting these days - for sable and other fur-bearing beasts - is left to professionals who spend weeks tracking and trapping the precious predators . But there ' s hardly a bureaucrat in Irkutsk who in early winter can resist donning his heavy fur boots , collecting his ax , kettle , skis , gun and dog , and heading into the taiga. // The ax is the main tool , Mr. Sveridov said . Only that and dry matches will get you through a Siberian night in the open . He recalled one time when he spent a week in the bush . The main thing is to leave enough time to build a nodya , a Siberian bonfire made by putting one log atop another in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hunter sleeps beside it - " only if it ' s cold , like today , you sleep a little less , " said Mr. Sveridov . It was 25 degrees below zero outside. // The hunters turn in their pelts at regional collecting depots , and from there they come to the Irkutsk fur center , the biggest of seven such warehouses in the Soviet Union. // Siberia ' s premier pelt is , of course , the sable , whose fur ringed the medieval crown of Muscovite grand princes , and whose pelts were carried by early Russian ambassadors to Europe instead of money and gifts . About 120 , 000 pelts are processed a year , most headed for the West in exchange for hard currency . But rare is the hunter who turns in all the precious pelts , and those withheld from the state turn up on Irkutsk women ' s heads , giving the city ' s streets a touch of class beyond its visible means. //                 @ @ @ @
