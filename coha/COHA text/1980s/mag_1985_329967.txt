For most people , leaving high public office quickly leads to a loss of prominence . Not so for Jeane Kirkpatrick . Ten weeks after returning to private life from her four-year stint as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations , the blunt-spoken Kirkpatrick has become a star on the lecture circuit , a hero within her newly adopted Republican Party and probably the most talked-about , albeit undeclared , electoral newcomer on the political scene . Though Kirkpatrick finds the glare of personal celebrity " very unexpected , " she is passing up few opportunities to make the most of it . " I get a lift from speaking out , " she says . " And there is just a dazzling array of opportunity . " <P> Outside of the President and perhaps the Vice President , Kirkpatrick , 58 , is the most sought after political speaker in the country . She plans to accept 50 of more than 200 lecture invitations she has received for the coming year . Her fee is $20,000 and up , meaning that she will pull in a cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demand . Last month she agreed to sign a $900,000 contract for a book about her experiences at the U.N . This fall she will begin writing a weekly newspaper column on foreign affairs , producing at least another $150,000 a year . <P> Kirkpatrick will also make about 20 unpaid appearances on behalf of the Republican Party in 1985 . The G.O.P. threw a bash in April just to celebrate her change of registration . Republican National Committee Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf plans to showcase Kirkpatrick in a $100,000 campaign to convert Democrats in four states with potentially close Senate races next year ( Florida , North Carolina , Pennsylvania and Louisiana ) . Last Friday 1,000 Republicans paid $50 a plate to hear her address a dinner in Des Moines ; counting others who put up $1,000 each to meet her at a private reception , her appearances raised more than $100,000 . Her speech sounded like a campaign rouser ; Democrats , she said , " ca n't get elected unless things get worse  --  and things wo n't get worse unless they get elected . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opined , " I think she would be a very attractive national candidate . " <P> Kirkpatrick 's cult standing with the party 's ruling right wing was firmly established last summer , when her attack on " the San Francisco Democrats , " whom she blamed for an era of national self-doubt , drew a foot-stamping response at the Republican Convention in Dallas . While her departure from the Administration was somewhat strained , Reagan went to considerable lengths to retain her . Though it has never been mentioned publicly , Secretary of State George Shultz offered her a job as his deputy . Kirkpatrick has continued to please conservative supporters with calls for an assertive U.S. foreign policy . She has been especially vocal in support of aid to the antigovernment contras in Nicaragua , and proudly notes that the rebels have named one of their 400-man brigades the Jeane Kirkpatrick Task Force .
