 | Early in 1954 , I returned from Europe in despair . My upcoming divorce from Italian actor Vittorio Gassman was on the front pages of the world 's press as I flew to California where our ten-month-old baby was staying with my mother and father . In Hollywood in the early Fifties , the " in " place was a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard called The Players . One night there I was introduced to a young Welshman named Dylan Thomas . He longed to meet Charlie Chaplin , so I invited him to . Sunday night , Dylan Thomas and I got into the little green Hornet he had borrowed and started out from Christopher Isherwood 's , with me driving up Summit Ridge Drive . As we got to the house , Dylan grabbed the wheel and somehow we drove down to Charlie Chaplin 's tennis court instead of up the driveway to his house . We knocked down the net , and made quite a scene , but at least we did n't skid into Charlie 's swimming pool . female , to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if we dined at the home of our friends , Peter and Mary , or at the tiny house Sean shared with his brother , Neil . LONDON Christopher Isherwood wrote me a wonderful role in the movie I Am a Camera ( no doubt for taking care of his friend , Dylan ) . One misty London morning , I went to Peter and Mary Noble 's for breakfast . On the floor in the corner of the kitchen sat one of the tallest , most masculine young Scotsmen I was ever to meet . Sean Connery ( that was his name ) was flat broke at the time , but he would never allow anyone , especially a When I left London , Peter Noble drove me to the airport . He mentioned that Sean and Neil might lose their house as they did n't have their yearly " ground rent , " of about $300 . I still had about $500 left in British pounds , so I said , " Peter , give this to Sean . " " You know he would n't take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered that Peter had written several books , so I plotted , " Tell Sean that you 've gotten a huge advance for another book and you want to lend him the money . " Peter smiled and took the money . I forgot all about it till about ten years later . Sean was in New York , already a millionaire playing James Bond , and we went to see Sammy Davis , Jr. , on Broadway in the musical version of Golden Boy . Afterward we went backstage , where Sammy 's then-wife , May Britt , modeled her new blond mink coat for me . I tried it on and adored it . A few days later , Sean spent the night on my sofa , because he was still so thrifty he would check out of The Plaza before a date when he was leaving town in order to save paying another night . That morning I drove him to the airport and when I returned a delivery man was at my door with a huge Christian Dior box . When I opened the box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fool 's Day , and Tony was delirious with joy because he had been offered a very important film called Wild Is the Wind , with Anna Magnani . He had to go on location in Nevada . Early in May , he called me and said I must come up to the location . Stan Kamen , Tony 's agent and friend , picked me up and we went to the airport . After we 'd been in the air for about half an hour , Stan took a ring box out of his pocket . " Shelley , this is for you , " he said . Inside the box was a diamond ring in the shape of a wishbone . " This is the ring that Tony ordered before he left , " Stan said . " This is for your wedding tonight . " If I 'd had a parachute I 'd have jumped out of the plane . But , somehow , the only objection I could voice was , " I have n't got a dress . " Stan said , " Shelley , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a JCPenney and bought a cotton dress with polka dots and a matching hat , and a pair of white highheeled sandals . The whole outfit cost about $30 . And so , we were married . We returned to Los Angeles . Tony would come home from work exhausted at 6:00 or 7:00 P.M. , and I would cook him glorious Italian meals . But toward the end of the filming , I noticed that he was coming home later and later . One night , about 8:30 , I called the guard at the Paramount gate , who said , " Mr. Franciosa left about 6:15 . I believe the limousine had to drop off Miss Magnani first . " I picked up a heavy award I had gotten from the Foreign Press , and stuck it in my purse . Then I drove to the Chateau Marmont , where Magnani was staying . Her door was n't locked ; I pushed it open . There were Magnani and Tony on the gorgeous living-room couch , stretched out , kissing . I must admit they were clutching their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safeguard . I started to scream appropriate Italian curses , and to chase Magnani around with my heavy award held high . Tony decided that if anyone was going to get killed , it was not going to be him . So he sat very still . Magnani managed to get out the door , whereupon I proceeded to chase her down the stairs . Somewhere around the third landing , she looked back at me , and we both started to laugh uncontrollably . She whispered , " Stupida ! Do n't laugh ! He kill us both if you laugh ! Be jealous and scream . " " Anna , it 's crazy , " I said . " Whatever , " she said , and slapped me . " For God 's sake , cry . Come on , chase me ! " So I began to chase her again . When we got to the garage , she jumped in her car , narrowly avoiding hitting mine , and sped down the hill . As soon as Magnani left , Tony came bounding out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing so hard my stomach hurt , but I pretended I was weeping bitterly . He tenderly took me in his arms . " Shelley , darling , how can you behave like this ? " he said . " I was only helping her with her English . " For the rest of the filming , Tony came home at 6:15 P.M. , and neither one of us mentioned the Chateau Marmont again . NEW YORK One elegant party sticks in my mind . It was at a prestigious new restaurant , The Four Seasons . Tony and I sat in the center of the restaurant , next to a large pond full of water lilies and gardenias . I felt lovely and loved and talented . Then Tony began to circulate around the room , mainly talking to other glamorous young actresses , and I began to feel deserted . Someone across the pond was trying to catch my attention . I finally put on my glasses and looked . It was Sir Laurence Olivier . I almost fell into the pond . He was mouthing lovely compliments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did likewise with my glass . I began not to miss Tony at all . Then ( glory of glories ) Laurence Olivier wrote a note and put it on a lily pad and pushed it toward me . Nobody saw it but the entire restaurant . I think I was blushing , but I retrieved the note . He 'd written , " Do you think I 'll ever catch you between husbands ? " I gestured to him to come over to my table . He came and took my hand and said , " Shelley , as you get older , you realize you only regret the things you did n't do . " We both laughed ? wistfully , I think . HOLLYWOOD George Stevens wanted me for the role of Mrs. Van Daan in the film version of The Diary of Anne Frank . I wept with joy . Tony was offered the chance to play the title role in Goya , with Ava Gardner , to be made in Rome . He was ecstatic , too . Tony flew back from Rome for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no idea who won ; I just know that Tony did n't . He held my hand tightly , and we both tried to smile for the TV cameras . Back in Rome , Tony began sending me very strange letters and cables that said , in essence , that his film was in terrible trouble . Two days after Anne Frank finished , he called me one middle-of-the-night , sounding so distraught I took the next flight to Rome . Tony met me at the airport . He put his arms around me and put a beautiful big velvet jewel box in my hand . Inside was a Bulgari pin in the shape of a seashell , with rows and rows of diamonds and sapphires , and matching earrings . " For God 's sake , Tony , " I cried , " What in the hell did you do ? "  | I put my arm around him and realized he was trembling . When we got to the hotel , I decided he needed food and sleep . I unpacked my suitcases , and went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through them , I thought I 'd better have a brandy . They all carried stories reporting my impending arrival in Rome " to arrange a divorce or annulment " from Anthony Franciosa ? except they were still referring to me as Mrs. Gassman . The big question was : Which movie star was Tony then going to marry ? Anna Magnani or Ava Gardner ? The Roman representatives of William Morris , Tony 's agency , arrived and explained to me that when Ava had heard I was coming to Rome , she 'd notified Henry Koster , the director , that she would only shoot at night and the set had to be closed to everyone but the actors and crew . I decided to ignore this information . When Tony woke from a nap , I took out the newspapers , and quietly asked : " Tony are you in love with Anna Magnani or Ava Gardner ? Do you want your freedom ? I 'm not angry , dear . I just want to know . " Half of me wanted him to say he was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid he would say so . He took me in his arms . " Shell , I only want to make a home with you , your kid , and our future children . " With mixed feelings , to say the least , I kissed him and sent him off to work . Then I planned how I could get him out of this mess . First , I put on a very loose girdle , then I took one of the small pillows from the sofa , stuffed it into the girdle , and pinned it in place . I dressed carefully , making my clothes look like maternity clothes . I knew that the Italian reverence for motherhood would see me through . As soon as I walked onto the set , the crew rushed to get me a comfortable chair and a footstool . Tony came out of makeup , did a double take , and then rushed to my side . Kneeling on the dirty stage floor , he began to kiss me . " Darling , " he said , " why did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loony picture and come to you . " At first I thought he was going along with my gag , but then I realized he truly believed that I was six months pregnant . Ava Gardner came out of her dressing room , looking like a goddess . Indeed , like the naked Maja ( now the title of the film ) . She gazed at this still life of the pregnant wife squatting on a chair , the husband 's arms around her . You could hear a pin drop on the soundstage . " Shelley , do n't pull that crap ! " Ava hissed . " You have n't even seen him for six months . " " Ava , darling , Tony was home for the Oscars , " I said . She looked as if she wanted to kill me , but she walked over to a makeup table , grabbed a handful of cold cream and smeared it all over her face ? eyelashes , hair , everything went . Henry Koster yelled : " It 's a wrap ! We 're rewriting the script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a week off . " Back in the hotel , I took off my maternity outfit and put the pillow back . Tony laughed and cried at the same time . The last shot of The Naked Maja was in the camera . I was packing when Tony called and said he was detained at the studio but that we would leave the next morning . By 9:30 P.M. , he was not home , so I ate dinner and went to sleep . When I woke up the next morning , he was asleep on the sofa . Driving with Tony back to Rome , the tension was as strong as the Naples sun . He looked as if he 'd been partying most of the night . Somewhere along the way I realized he was hung over and in a state of mind that made it dangerous for him to drive . Suddenly the car rolled over in slow motion into a ditch , and landed on its roof . I ended up in an Italian hospital with a concussion . The next thing I remember after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | NEW YORK The relationship between Tony and me was so strained that I was arranging never to be alone with him . But between Thanksgiving and Christmas , I almost relented . I was cueing Tony on his lines for The Story on Page One , when the phone in the bedroom rang . I picked it up . It was Lauren Bacall . " I 've been waiting for Tony for an hour , " Lauren said angrily . " I 'm sitting in Danny 's Hideaway alone . Where the hell is he ? " " Lauren , " I replied , " you 're complaining to me because my husband is late for a date with you ? " " Well , dear , " she said , " if your husband does n't respect your marriage , why should I ? " " You 're absolutely right , Lauren . He 'll be there in a few minutes . Look for a man with a bandaged head . " HOLLYWOOD Suddenly , I found Judy Balaban Cantor calling me for parties . She was married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCA , and was the daughter of Barney Balaban , president of Paramount . Judy and Jay had two lovely little girls . One day Judy insisted on showing me a spectacular house on Rodeo Drive that was priced way under market value right across the street from her house . " Tony has already seen this house , " she said , " and loves it . " I wondered if Judy was taking up real estate on the side . My mom , my nurse , my little girl , and Tony had returned to New York when one Friday evening my phone rang . A husky voice with a Scottish accent said , " Hello , Shelley . Guess what ? I have finally made it to Los Angeles . " It was Sean Connery , who was doing a film at Disney Studios , Darby O'Gill and the Little People . " Pick me up and we 'll go some place elegant for dinner , " he said . I proceeded to put on my sexiest outfit and longest eyelashes . Sean was waiting in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I again realized how manly , mature , and magnificent he was . Somewhere around 2:00 A.M. , Sean drove to a cliff overlooking the Pacific . I began to tell him about the nonsensical relationship I was involved in and he said something very wise : " Shelley , you 're a very strong woman . Perhaps Tony secretly is longing for a meek young girl who treats him like he was God . Most actors want that . " I did n't know whether to thank Sean or punch him , so I decided to kiss him . We did n't go back to Hollywood to our respective films , till Monday morning . I finished my movie and started packing to get back to New York . The evening news came on . I was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for Dia- ry of Anne Frank . A little while later , Sean arrived , carrying a bottle of champagne and flowers . When he opened the door , I was sitting in the middle of the floor , crying . " I ca n't take Tony to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win ? He will be hurt and resentful . " NEW YORK When I got to my apartment , no one , but no one , mentioned that I had been nominated . The next day at the Actors Studio , when everyone started congratulating me , finally Tony did too . When Oscar time rolled around in April , I took myself out to California , and I won . HOLLYWOOD Tony , his mother , and I were flying to California . In the airport , I bought the usual magazines , and then I did one of the stupidest things I 've ever done in my life . I bought Confidential . Sometime after lunch , I opened Confidential . There was the following item : " Tony Franciosa and Judy Balaban are quite an item . Judy is helping Shelley look for a house . We wonder if Jay Cantor and Shelley Winters are going to move into this new house with all their children . " I took the magazine to the rest room ,  | tore it into small pieces , and flushed it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraved in blood on my soul . Sometime during the trip , I told Tony about the item . At first he did exactly what men usually do : denied everything . I waited till the denials petered out , and then I calmly answered that I hoped he was serious about Judy . " She has two small children , " I said , " and since we 're going to eventually divorce , let 's try to do it with as much dignity as possible . " When we got to Beverly Hills , the phone rang . It was Judy Balaban Cantor . I took a breath and said quietly , " Judy if you ever call here again , I 'm going to do something truly terrible to you . I 'm going to give you Tony . " Long pause . Then she answered , " Never mind , Shelley . I 've already got him . " HOLLYWOOD I got a call from Sean Connery . He wanted me to go that evening to a press screening of a film he had done with Ursula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film ; in fact he hated it . By the time we came out of the theater that night , Sean was a superstar . But he still felt the whole thing was glitzy , mannered , and dangerous . Finally I said , " Sean , if you truly do n't want to do any more Bond pictures , just ask for some outrageous sum like a million dollars a picture for three pictures . " He laughed . At the time he felt this was a great way to turn down the American producers . But as the world knows , they accepted his terms , and God only knows what he got after those three Bond pictures . Though Sean now has an Oscar , I 'm sure he remembers what fun it was in those days when women fainted at his feet . Or maybe he does n't . Maybe , like me , he has gladly made the transition to character roles . Next time I see him , I must ask him . NEW YORK When I block , I block . After Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of him during the next 20 years or so , but I blocked out his existence completely . Then , in 1982 , at the Actors Studio , I saw a tall , middle-aged , handsome man . I did n't know who he was , but he looked familiar . " Shelley , " he said , getting very red , " do n't you remember me ? Tony , your friend , your ex-husband ? " I truly did not remember . Thank God , Al Pacino , who was coming up the steps in back of Tony , quickly jumped into the conversational gap and showed Tony to a seat .
