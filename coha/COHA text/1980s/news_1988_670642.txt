Other countries ' restrictions on the drug have in many cases been much more stringent than those in the United States , American and European health experts said in interviews yesterday. // In Britain , for example , women accepting the drug must sign a form in which they stipulate that they will avoid pregnancy while using the drug . They must also agree to immediate abortion if they become pregnant. // In 1982 , the United States was the first country to license Accutane , allowing its prescription , with a strong warning label , by any doctor . Other countries followed , but often with stronger measures to limit the drug ' s use to essential cases and to prevent its use by pregnant women. // In the United States , some officials were aware of the stronger measures abroad and worried about the dangers . But not until this week , after officials estimated that hundreds of babies may have been born severely deformed because of the drug , was the need for a change in policy widely accepted. // Many European doctors have for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug in the United States , American and European experts said in interviews. // " The U.S. experience is one which horrifies us , " Dr. Adrian Ive , a clinical lecturer in dermatology at the University of Newcastle in England , said in a telephone interview yesterday. // Accutane is coming under intense scrutiny now because scientists at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control have argued that it causes so many severe birth defects that access to it should be stringently controlled . Some officials think it should be taken off the market altogether. // Federal studies indicate that women who take even small doses of the drug in pregnancy have at least a 25 percent chance of having a baby with severe birth defects , including mental retardation , often lethal heart defects , and malformed faces that typically have no ears or ears below their chins . An additional 40 percent of fetuses are spontaneously aborted. // Since it was approved for sale by prescription in the United States in 1982 , Accutane has been accompanied by strong written warnings against use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Tuesday , an advisory board of the Food and Drug Administration recommended that distribution of the drug be restricted , although specific measures were not agreed upon . Drug ' s Toll in U.S. At that meeting , Dr. David Graham of the drug agency gave a new estimate of the drug ' s toll in this country . Based on data from Medicaid programs in Michigan and Florida and from a health maintenance organization in Washington state , staff members at the agency estimate that as many as 9 , 180 American women took the drug while pregnant and that 597 babies have been born with severe birth defects from 1982 through 1986. // This superseded an estimate made in February and widely publicized last week , based only on Medicaid data , that as many as 1 , 300 babies had been born deformed. // In England and in Spain , Accutane is regulated the same way as thalidomide , a drug that caused thousands of birth defects , mostly in Europe , in the 1960 ' s . Since then use of thalidomide in young women has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accutane and it is not approved for marketing in Sweden. // Although there are official reports of 62 babies born in the United States with severe birth defects because their mothers took Accutane in pregnancy , only 9 such babies have been reported outside the United States , according to Carolyn Glynn , a spokewoman for Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. , the drug ' s manufacturer . Six of the nine were in Canada , which regulates the drug in the same way as this country does. // After Accutane , whose generic name is isotretinoin , was approved for marketing in the United States , reports started coming in of infants who were grossly malformed because their mothers took the drug while pregnant . <> <> Fears Preceded Approval // The drug was suspected of producing birth defects before it was approved for marketing because it produced severe birth defects in laboratory animals . Hoffmann-La Roche started working with the drug in the early 1970 ' s but did not try to market it until the late 1970 ' s when it discovered that it dramatically clears severe acne that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarring. // In the case of thalidomide in the 1960 ' s , the drug was marketed in Europe but was not permitted in the United States by officials who saw cause to worry . But with Accutane , which has been compared in severity to thalidomide , it was the United States that first approved marketing and imposed less restrictive distribution than many other countries who later approved the drug. // This example , at least , runs counter to an image commonly drawn by critics of the F.D.A. who say its overly cautious policies deny Americans access to important drugs available abroad. // " This is the most prominant example of the drug lag in reverse , " said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Health Research Group in Washington , a consumer advocacy group. // Although Roche Laboratories says that the 62 reported infants with birth defects account for nearly all the problem in the United States , researchers at the drug agency and the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta say that most cases are never reported and they believe the toll has been in the hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday , the F.D.A advisory board recommended new restrictions such as , for example , requiring second medical opinions before prescriptions are filled or establishing centralized distribution with expert scrutiny of requests . The board endorsed a proposal by Roche to make much more prominent its warnings to doctors , pharmacists and women. // " We are open and willing and going to move promptly with the F.D.A. , " Ms. Glynn of Roche said. // Researchers at the drug and disease-control agencies who have contacted experts in other countries say the drug is prescribed much less often elsewhere and that in many cases there are strong controls in place to assure that it is not taken by pregnant women. // In Britain , Accutane is grouped with thalidomide and some very dangerous cancer chemotherapy drugs in a special category for stringent controls . A select group of 350 dermatologists are the only doctors allowed to prescribe the drug . A woman with acne first goes to her own doctor who must refer her to one of these dermatologists for treatment with Accutane. // If the dermatologist decides to prescribe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant , gives her a written warning , and has her sign an informed consent form , in duplicate , so she can take one copy home . In addition , said Dr. Ive , " She agrees that if she becomes pregnant she will have an abortion immediately . " <> <> Restrictions in Spain // In Spain , according to Dr. Jose Cordero of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , the drug can only be prescribed by dermatologists and can only be dispensed in hospital pharmacies . Not only are the women warned and counseled about the pregnancy risk , but careful records are kept. // " Every hospital pharmacy has to fill out a form each month giving the name and address of every female patient taking Accutane , " Dr. Cordero said . The form is sent to the Ministry of Health. // He said that in Sweden , the drug was not approved for marketing , but acne patients can receive it if their doctors make a special request to the government and justify their need for it. // In France , said Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently approved and it is not paid for by the national health insurance program . " It is given much more carefully and patients have to pay for it themselves , " he said. // Dr. Ive , the British doctor , said that he and other Europeans are wary of Accutane because they vividly remember the days when thalidomide was freely prescribed as a sedative and sleeping pill . Thousands of babies were born with flipper-like arms and legs . The drug was never approved in the United States , but it was distributed to doctors in premarket testing , so some thalidomide babies were born here . But Europe was hit hard. // " Accutane is as bad as thalidomide , but it doesn ' t have the emotional connotation of thalidomide , " Dr. Ive said . " As a group of doctors who lived through thalidomide , we are much more careful about using Accutane. " //
