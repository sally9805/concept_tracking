" This is America - a town of a few thousand , in a region of wheat and corn and dairies and little groves . " The town is , in our tale , called Gopher Prairie , ' Minnesota . But its Main Street is the continuation of Main Streets everywhere . The story would be the same in Ohio or Montana , in Kansas or Kentucky or Illinois , and not very differently would it be told Up York State or in the Carolina Hills . . . " - Sinclair Lewis " Main Street " SAUK CENTRE , Minn. - It was cold , close to 25 below zero on Jan. 28 , 1951 , the day that " Harry " Lewis ' hometown honored him at a memorial service in the high school auditorium , recalls Dick Schwartz , co-owner of the Palmer House Hotel . " I remember walking to the high school that day - I was a junior - and seeing the window of a department store shatter from the cold , " Schwartz says . " Lewis was an atheist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only religious part of the ceremony was when three women got up and sang the hymn , I Hear a Forest Praying . ' " " He was odd , eccentric I guess . No town is prepared for a guy like that , " said Schwartz , assessing the chronically ambivalent relationship between the famous novelist and the small midwestern town he invested with international celebrity . It was 60 years ago this month that " Main Street " was published , an event without parallel in the American publishing industry . Lewis would have settled for a sale of 10,000 copies ; his publisher , Alfred Harcourt , was more enthusiastic : around 20,000 , he predicted . In the first six months of 1921 , sales had exceeded 180,000 copies . Today , the figure is well into the millions . Lewis had made it big at the age of 35 with his fifth novel , a mordant satire of provincial narrowness , bigotry and boosterism . Letters of praise streamed in from such literay notables of the time as H. L. Mencken , Hugh Walpole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindsay , and even from the grande dame of American letters , Edith Wharton . From a fellow Minnesotan whose first novel , " This Side of Paradise , " was published that same year , came the following : " I want to tell you that Main Street ' has displaced ( The Damnation of ) Theron Ware ' in my favor as the best American novel . The amount of sheer data is amazing ! As a writer and a Minnesotan let me swell the chorus - after a third reading , " wrote 23-year-old F. Scott Fitzgerald of St. Paul . " Main Street " at first evoked wrath in this town and its environs . In nearby Alexandria it was banned ; the weekly Sauk Centre Herald kept editorial silence for five months before noting in its edition of March 13 , 1921 : " A perusal of the book makes it possible for one to picture in his mind ' s eyes local characters having been injected bodily into the story . " Within two years the town had forgiven all , and Harry Lewis ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was welcomed back as Sauk Centre ' s national treasure . Today , Lewis is a cottage industry . Oversized street signs in the town proclaim : " Original Main Street ' ; a Sinclair Lewis Avenue bisects it . There is a " Sinclair Lewis Interpretive Center , " featuring a Lewis Museum ; the athletic teams of the Sauk Centre High School are called the " Main Streeters , " or , abridged , the " Streeters . " A poster inside the Palmer House Hotel heralds a stage presentation of " Strangers , " a play about the stormy marriage of Sinclair Lewis and newspaper columnist Dorothy Thompson . But as Don Griswold , the publisher of the Sauk Centre Herald , remarked drily the other day : " They ' re having trouble filling the 200-seat auditorium for the play . " In Sauk Centre parlance , Griswold is a " transplant " - he is not native to the town . He moved here in 1971 from a town in western Wisconsin when he decided to buy the newspaper . An amiable curmudgeon , Griswold discusses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lewis isn ' t the drawing card he once was . I think he ' s had his day . " Sinclair Lewis is not as much debated here as the little Sinclair Lewises who come here and expect to find bigots hiding behind every curtain . " Then he commences a harangue about " hit-and-run journalists who come here with preconceptions about the town , and never bother to take a note because their story is mostly written before they ever arrive here . " Griswold cites as the most egregious example of that style of journalism a reporter from Pravda who visited a year or two ago . " I took him to dinner , took him around town and introduced him to everyone , and then he wrote a story quoting me as saying things I never said . " The gist of the Pravda story was that Lewis somehow was ruined by the capitalist society he wrote about . " Griswold offers a final observation about Lewis and " Main Street " : " It ' s bunkum to think that Lewis was saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A town as closely knit as ours is almost tribal . Everyone knows it ' s in his interest to be a good guy . And this kind of society tends to eliminate thecriminal . " Dave Jacobson , a native of Sauk Centre , whose grandfather homesteaded the farm he now lives on , was the first teacher at the high school to make " Main Street " required reading . " In college ( Minnesota State University at St. Cloud ) and in the Army , I was embarrassed when people who knew I came from Sauk Centre started asking me questions about Lewis . I just didn ' t know that much about him . " Jacobson remedied that deficiency , and determined that Sauk Centre ' s high- school graduates should know about the author . The student reaction to " Main Street " : " They seem to identify pretty closely with the book , even though it was written in 1920 . And I ' ve had students say to me , I know somebody just like Mrs. Bogart ( the town gossip ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though a Gopher Prairie regards itself as a part of the Great World , compares itself to Rome and Vienna , it will not acquire the scientific spirit , the international mind , which would make it great . It picks at information which will visibly procure money or social distinction . Its conception of a community ideal is not the grand manner , the noble aspiration , the fine aristocratic pride , but cheap labor for the kitchen and rapid increase in the price of land . " Some geographical and physical facts about Sauk Centre : The city is about 110 miles northwest of Minneapolis-St . Paul ; or 130 miles southeast of Fargo , N.D. ; or 350 miles south of Winnipeg , Canada . The population is about 3600 , down about 2000 since the 1970 census . The downtown area and most of the houses - many of them small " ramblers , " with some bungalows , colonials and Victorians - are carefully maintained . There are 10 churches , one movie house ( called the " Main Street " ) , one department store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club with a nine-hole golf course , and one hotel . The hotel is the Palmer House , which is owned by Dick Schwartz , 46 , and Al Tingley , 48 , a " transplant " from Auburn , Maine . The two men met in Minneapolis , became friends , and pooled their money to buy the rundown hotel . Built in 1901 , it was basically a hotel for traveling salesmen that went into decline in the mid-1920s . Now it has been restored and become a popular gathering place for residents and visitors . Lewis worked briefly at the hotel as a night clerk the summer after he graduated from high school , and according to local lore was fired because he failed to awaken a salesman in time for him to catch the 5:30 a.m. train out of town . " I had a preconception when I first came to Sauk Centre , " Tingley says . " I had read almost all of Lewis ' books , and I wanted to see Main Street ' as it was , with the old cornices on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernity all around . " Tingley concedes " there is a narrowness of view " in Sauk Centre , but adds : " The attitudes are really no different here than they are in Auburn , Maine . " Among the younger " transplants " who frequent the Palmer House is Dr. Jeffrey Millman , 33 , a physician who grew up in Brooklyn , graduated from the University of Chicago Medical School and went to Los Angeles for his internship and residency . The parents of Millman ' s wife , Patricia , are both from Sauk Centre but moved to Los Angeles before she was born . " I visited here when Patti ' s grandmother died and I really liked it , " Millman says . " I wanted to practice in a small town , and after I filled in for another doctor for a few weeks , we decided to move here . " I don ' t think things have changed here that much since Main Street ' in terms of attitude , " Millman says . " People are friendly here , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them tend to be cautious , suspicious . " As an example of the city ' s adherence to old ways , Millman tells of his attempt to get Sauk Centre to operate a city-owned ambulance . " The city didn ' t want to do it because it would be stepping on the toes of a private operator who had the contract for years , taking his income away . The reason : We ' ve had it all these years , and it ' s worked , why change now ? ' " One reason for the Millmans ' decision to move here , he said , is that " there isn ' t a better place to raise children . " They have a 7- year-old daughter . " It ' s safe - we don ' t have to lock our doors - there ' s clean air and relatively clean water . " His wife , he says , is " something of a Carol Kennicott . " ( She is the protagonist of " Main Street , " an educated woman from the Twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country doctor in a small town . ) " She misses cultural things - restaurants , a college nearby , and all that goes along with it : new ideas , liberal ideas , things that are lacking here . " Still , the doctor says , the absence of external intellectual stimuli presents a challenge : " People in a small town are each other ' s entertainment . You have to work at it . " Most communities have prominent families - leaders , achievers , vogue- setters - and in Sauk Centre one of these is named DuBois . Pat DuBois is the third generation of his family to serve as president of the First State Bank . Another branch of his family has produced three generations of physicians . Dressed in a blue pin-stripe suit , DuBois , about 60 , says of Sauk Centre : " This is a comfortable place to live . Our schools , water , sewers , are all adequate for today , and we ' re not that far from the Twin Cities . " " We are not a a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , people live with understanding of other people . We have two strong Lutheran churches , and two strong Catholic , but religious leaders here are tolerant in the interests of community development . " " Main Street ' ? I never finished it . It never intrigued me . It might now . I ' m more of a reader , more tolerant . " " Carol drove through an astonishing number of books from the public library and from city shops . Kennicott was at first uncomfortable over her disconcerting habit of buying them . A book was a book , and if you had several thousand of them right here in the library , free , why the dickens should you spend your good money ? " The Sauk Centre Public Library is a squat , gray , one-and-a half- story brick building on Main Street . A plaque near the front door bears this tributefrom Lewis : " To the Bryant Libary . . . With lovely memory of the days when its books were my greatest adventure . " Phyllis Lahti , head librarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-selling fiction " and lists as the most popular authors Louis L ' Amour , the king of the Western novelists , and Sidney Sheldon , whose bent is romantic adventure . Lahti , who has been in her job for only a few months , says she has some innovations in mind , among which is the formation of a " Friends of the Library Group to stimulate interest in reading . " " The people in this city are very sports-minded , and the way one season overlaps another it doesn ' t leave much time for reading . " Sinclair Lewis was a Yale man , Lahti says , and there is a family in town with a son , she believes , who also is attending the college . Michael McDonald , it develops , is a freshman at Harvard , although he had been accepted at Yale and Columbia as well , says his mother , Joan McDonald . " For a while Mike was kind of fascinated with the notion of being the first Sauk Centre boy since Lewis to go to Yale . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alumni from this area , " says his mother . Bill and Joan McDonald moved here to their house on Main Street in 1960from Waterloo , Iowa , where both worked as reporters on the Waterloo Courier . " The pay was terrible , " she recalls , " and when Bill got an offer to put out the publication for the Independent Trade Assn. we didn ' t have to think about it too long . " At first , Joan McDonald says , " I identified with Carol Kennicott a lot . But I took the advice of a very bright friend of mine who told me : You can have just as variegated a circle of friends in a small town as in a big city - but you have to make an effort to find them . ' " The late Mark Schorer , one of Lewis ' biographers , noted of him and " Main Street " that he had " become through this single book a spokesman for a literary generation . . . a single writer who presented American culture and American attitudes toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a replacement for the former occupant of that exalted position , William Dean Howells , who had died in the spring of 1920 . In that third decade of the century Lewis flourished , with four more critically acclaimed novels to reinforce his reputation : " Babbitt , " " Arrowsmith , " " Elmer Gantry " and " Dodsworth . " In 1930 , Lewis became the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature , an honor that also marked the beginning of his personal and professional decline . His marriage in 1928 to foreign correspondent Dorothy Thompson - the second for both - was a union of two supreme egoists . Thompson ' s reputation soared in the 1930s , while Lewis ' faded , a descent accelerated by his heavy drinking . From all accounts , they were badly matched ; she with her love of political arguments and abstract discussion and he with his inability to discuss intelligently anything outside his narrow range of interest . Still , Lewis kept writing during this period , and in the eight years after their divorce in 1942 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , returning to the United States briefly in 1949 . He went back to Europe in 1950 , and made his way to Italy , where he started another novel , never finished . Schorer offered this critical appraisal of Lewis : " He was one of the worst writers in modern American literature but without his writing one can not imagine modern American literature . That is because , without his writing , we can hardly imagine ourselves . . . . He gave us a vigorous , perhaps a unique thrust into the imagination of ourselves . " On Dec. 31 , 1950 , Lewis was taken from his home in Rome to a clinic on the outskirts of the city . The diagnosis was acute delirium tremens . He was never rational again and died of a heart attack 10 days later . Lewis was cremated , and his ashes put in an urn and flown to the United States , arriving in Sauk Centre on Jan. 21 , 1951 . The urn was polished by the town ' s undertaker and deposited in the bank until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schorer wrote , family and friends proceeded to the Lewis family plot in the cemetery , where his brother , the " thrifty Dr. Claude , saw no reason for putting the handsome urn in the ground when it might serve as a memorial to his brother in the Bryant Library . . . . " Dr. Lewis cut the sealed wire of the urn , peered into it , knelt and slowly let the ashes slide out . A gust of wind came up and scattered some of them on the artificial grass , blew some into air . . . . " Dick Schwartz recalls a comment attributed to the mortician , Charles Corrigan : " Well , Lewis got away from this town after all . "
