" Wake up , George , " the figure standing in the shadows said . " It 's time we had a little chat . " George stirred . " It would be kinder and gentler to let me sleep for a while , " he said , " and a kinder and gentler America is what I 'd like to see . " " Wake up , George , " the visitor per  --  sisted . George opened one eye . " It ca n't be the radio alarm clock , " he said out loud . " Because my radio alarm is permanently set on a country music station  --  anybody who thinks I 'm not a regular guy can check that out ? and that , voice is not a country voice . " " Good for you , George , " the visitor said , in a voice that was indeed a voice that could only belong to an Easterner of the landed class . The words barely escaped from jaws that were almost clenched shut , as if the speaker were feeling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skippy Super Chunk . " Marvelous . You 're absolutely right . This is not one of your hayseed friends . " George sat up in bed . " Who are you ? " he demanded . " What are you doing here ? " " But surely you remember , George , " the visitor said . " We made a little arrangement . You said you 'd sell your very soul to win , I said that could be arranged , we shook on it , and that was that . A handshake between gentlemen . " " But I did n't make that deal with you , " George said . " I made it with Roger Ailes , my media adviser . You do n't look like Roger Ailes . " " You must know , George , that I can appear in any form I choose to appear in , " the visitor said . " And , not to be snob  --  bish about it , the form of Roger Ailes is not actually one of my favorites . " George reached over for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was still standing in the shadows , almost en  --  folded in the heavy bedroom drapes . " But you look famil  --  iar , " George said to the visitor . " Where 'd you prep ? " " You 're getting warm , George . " George stared at the visitor . Then he said , tentatively , " Coach Watson ? " " An old enemy of mine , " the visitor said . " I took his face this evening as a little joke . " " Coach Watson is the one who taught me that when the Great Scorekeeper comes around he does n't ask who won or lost but how they played the game , " George said . " Coach Watson told me that winning a game was worthless if you had to stick your thumb in a man 's eye to do it . " " I do n't know why people persist in saying that you 've gone through life remembering names and forgetting lessons , " the visitor said . " Those were precisely Watson 's lessons ? the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what I had to do , " George said . " They did n't bring you up to do what you had to do , George , " the visitor said . " They brought you up to do what you were supposed to do . " Suddenly , George felt very cold . He pulled the covers up over his shoulders , wrapping himself in them as he had learned to do with the flag . " Listen , " he said , " I could have won anyway . I did n't need Willie Horton or the A.C.L.U. thing . We had peace and prosperity on our side . We had the South . " " Watson could have won the Exeter game anyway , " the visitor said . " But when I presented him with the opportunity to distract the Exeter quarterback with a young lady of my acquaintance , just to be on the safe side , he threw me out of his office . " George was silent for a while . Finally he said , " I do n't know how to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  you know ? well , call in the bet right away , do you ? If you know what I mean . " He wrapped the blankets more tightly around his shoulders , but a shiver went through him . " Are you kidding ? " the visitor said . " Considering the airhead who 'd succeed you if I did ! Listen , I may change forms all the time , but I 've got to live in this country . " Suddenly , George heard another voice  --  singing . " I ai n't bowlin ' in your bowlin ' league no more , " the voice sang , You bowled a strike when it came to me But now we 're split and I can see You used me as a spare , though it was n't really fair . Then you told me as you left me at the door That I ai n't bowlin ' in your bowlin ' league no more . The clock alarm ! " Country music , " George muttered as he opened his eyes .

" For you maybe , " the visitor said , in a voice growing fainter . " The rest of us are going to have to live through it . "
