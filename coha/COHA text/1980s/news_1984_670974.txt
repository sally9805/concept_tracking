For the tabloid American Weekly the tragedy was a bonanza worthy of a full page brimming with details of his death and the extravagant bohemian existence that led up to it . Werner von Haftmann , in his history of 20th-century painting , states bluntly that suicide was the price Pascin paid for prostituting his art . Yet he concedes the artist was a brilliant draftsman and , grouping him with other painters of Jewish descent ( Chaim Soutine and Moise Kisling among them ) , muses on what he sees as the distinctively Jewish contribution to Expressionism. // Needless to say , little if any of the foregoing can be deduced from the Pascin paintings and drawings now at Perls , Madison Avenue , between 78th and 79th Streets . But there is the scent of that old Viennese malaise epitomized by the work of Gustave Klimt and Egon Schiele - of languorous goings-on in curtained rooms and whatnot . Pascin ' s graphic expertise is probably equal to that of the Austrian masters and certainly owes something to them . That the similarity is not immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 ' s , when hair was bobbed and skirts were up. // As a painter , he starts in this display with some comparatively robust studies , such as the 1912 standing nude , the shape of whose legs is parodied by those of a table behind and the stems of a plant nearby . He then moves into the Cezannesque phase that more or less coincided with a period spent in the United States and Cuba . After his return to Paris in the early 1920 ' s , the pigment gets thinner and its application looser and , by the middle of the decade , the artist has achieved his characteristic fluffy technique of painting supported by an " armature " of dainty contours drawn in charcoal. // A fine example of this is " Petite Fille en Robe Jaune " ( 1927 ) , where a little girl sits on a bentwood chair holding a posy . There is the suggestion of a dog at her feet and a washstand at her side . A lovely blend of gauzy yellows , light browns and pale grays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s own imagination . She is obviously a child but sometimes it is only the bouquet in hand that distinguishes the very young from the mature . Except when his wife , Hermine ( usually clothed and with eyes downcast ) , is the model , Pascin ' s females tend to be soft-focus fantasies with the same expressionless faces and rosebud lips . Men are given more serious , though not necessarily more interested , treatment. // Perhaps the artist did become a hack of sorts , like Kees van Dongen , who was flourishing as a " moderne " society portraitist about the same time . Still , it is hard to dismiss Pascin , given his talents , especially for Watteauish flesh . And if Balthus is to be accorded grand master status , it is difficult to take issue with these works ' vaguely seedy eroticism . Apropos , there is a 1921 ink line drawing of the artist apprenticing himself as boy-draftsman to a brothel . This is but one of many humorous touches ; others are to be found in the nearly 8-foot-by-10-foot scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in baggy breeches , cattle with tails curled up to match their curving horns and thoroughbred horses - lounge around a large , pink- roofed bathhouse set in a mountainous landscape . A 1924 work in mostly silvery greens and grays on a black ground , this unstretched canvas is said to have been painted for one of the artist ' s riotous parties. // At a glance , Volume I of a catalogue raisonne - the publication of which by Editions Abel Rambert of Paris the show celebrates - indicates that there is more to Pascin esthetically as well as numerically than meets the eye in this exhibition . All the same , the impression over all is of a painter who , technically , built upon Modernism and in fact had a Cubist period , but who , mentally , remained stuck in the twilight zone of pre-World War I Europe . ( Through Nov. 17. ) // // // Also of interest this week : <> <> Alfonso Ossorio ( Oscarsson Hood , 41 West 57th Street ) : Alfonso Ossorio was never ahead of his time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drip painting in the 1950 ' s ( he was once the owner of " Lavender Mist , " a major Pollock canvas ) . Still - and it ' s only a hunch - time appears to have caught up with this 68-year-old artist , who has long been known for the large relief-assemblages he calls " Congregations . " These are weirder and project more aggressively into the room than before , and instead of bric- a-brac embedded in a ground now consist of bones and skulls ( some of them human ) , antlers and horns , brightly lacquered bits of wood , mirrors , marbles and the artist ' s " signature " glass eyes . All are attached to a wood background . But in these and the paintings on paper accompanying them , the spirit remains as savage and obsessive as ever and could fit with no trouble into the so-called East Village scene . Gaudy and far from attractive , the work assaults the spectator but , reflecting its origin in the artist ' s longstanding fascination with tribal symbolism , it exerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unawares in the dark . ( Through Nov. 3. ) // // <> <> John Bellany ( Esman , 121 Spring Street ) : John Bellany ' s mise en sc ene is still the North Sea , beside which he grew up in Scotland , and there are still many allusions to the men who fish its waters . For example , in " The Ventriloquist , " a figure stands in an open boat holding a skate in one hand and a crustacean with a single red claw in the other . The symbolism , however , grows ever more obscure : the figure has a head resembling a goose - or is it a porpoise ? - wearing a spotted cap . Actually , it is a head that with minor variations is given to humans and dogs alike in other paintings , some of which include recognizable animals as well as composites . An acknowledged influence , Max Beckmann is particularly apparent in the awkward style of composition ; but there are also traces of Francis Bacon and James Ensor in the imagery and the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impastoed Expressionism enjoys prestige in Britain , where a 10- year retrospective of his has just completed a tour and where , possibly , the artist ' s allusions to Northern European mythology are more easily understood . ( Through Nov. 8. ) // // <> <> Leon Goldin ( Kraushaar , Fifth Avenue at 57th Street ) : A professor of painting and drawing at Columbia University , Leon Goldin is a geometric abstractionist who owes more to the Renaissance than Mondrian . That is , his shapes are arranged according to the rule of the Golden Section and are painted in low-key naturalistic colors . The impression is of architectural masses seen through a window with usually an area of pale blue suggesting sky . And , in fact , the canvases are all transmutations of the view from the artist ' s window on 23d Street . While the city prompts four- and five-sided shapes , the coast of Maine is converted into organic forms and summery colors done in gouache . Still , that these images are metaphors neither disqualifies them as abstractions nor detracts from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
