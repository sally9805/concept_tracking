txt A subscriber to the Dallas Morning News recently complained that the newspaper had grown so heavy with classified advertising and special sections that her well-trained but small dog could no longer fetch it into the house . Carlton Barnes , a former circulation director of the News , had to deny her request that the paper be delivered without these sections . Instead , he told her : " You have to get yourself a bigger dog . " Not only is the bulk of some newspapers burdening little dogs , but it has effectively eliminated newspaper carriers of small stature . Bedford Brown , a distributor for the Washington Post . says he has switched to adults and husky teen-agers to deliver the Post , whose copies now weigh as much as five pounds on some days . " Unless you get good-sized boys , they just would n't last , " he says . Mr. Brown also has had to switch delivery vehicles . When he started as a distributor for the Post 40 years ago , he could fit all of his 2,500-paper delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 18-foot van for the same number of papers . Keep on Growing So it goes for people who moan that newspapers have grown too fat . While some newspapers , such as the Washington Star and the Philadelphia Bulletin , shrank to death , others kept right on growing , much to the distress of deliverers and conscientious newspaper readers . Some of the latter echo the complaint of Judith Coburn , a Los Angeles free-lance writer and a reader of the bulky , multisection Los Angeles Times : " I constantly have this feeling that I 'll never get through it . Sometimes I feel like Sisyphus , rolling a ball of newspapers up a hill . " Miss Coburn 's plight does n't inspire a lot of sympathy among newspaper executives . Big newspapers ? " mega-newspapers , " an observer calls them  --  such as the Los Angeles Times , Washington Post , New York Times , Chicago Tribune and Houston Chronicle carry lots of advertising and so are healthy . " Big , fat newspapers are the ones surviving . " says Eugene L. Roberts Jr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30% fatter since the rival Bulletin died last February . Fueling the growth is the sectional phenomenon , which has meant a proliferation of special-interest sections and preprinted advertising supplements . Adds Mr. Roberts , ' because we 're trying to serve a diverse audience  --  housewives and working women and people with incomes of $100,000 or $10,000 ? the newspaper , to be relevant to all of them , has to be a supermarket , not a specialty grocery store . " But other newspaper executives worry that the monstrous size of newspapers could backfire . Readers , ever more hurried , will devote less time per page or discard whole sections as the newspaper 's page count rises . " The answer is n't to put out a 400-page newspaper , " says Barry Bingham Jr. , editor and publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal . " All that does is break down 14-year-old carriers , which is inhumane , and means whole sections go unread into the landfill , which is awful . " Nevertheless , Mr. Bingham acknowledges that his newspaper does n't have the ate , f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc advertising right now to be a giant , and the problem of bulk , he says , is " one of the problems I wish I had . " The Los Angeles Times , which its skinny rival , the Herald Examiner , has dubbed " the whale , " is ambivalent about how its size affects readers . The paper has advertised that readers should n't feel guilty if they are n't able to read all of the newspaper , which averages 123 pages daily and 512 pages on Sundays ( 70% bigger than it was 10 years ago ) . Yet the Times also boasts that it is the world 's largest newspaper  --  last year it consumed 400,000 tons of newsprint , roughly 4% of total U.S. consumption  --  andit plans to expand further when new press capacity is introduced next year . " I wish it were twice as large so we could comment on and write about twice as many events , " says Steve Wasserman , a Times assistant editor . How do his friends react to that view ? " They look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't oblivious to another problem of unbridled growth : " We 'd need an army of Arnold Schwarzeneggers to carry them . " The Wall Street Journal is more compact than most major newspapers . But The Journal , citing pressures to print more news and advertising , plans to increase its maximum size by eight pages to 64 during the next two years . Peter Kann , associate publisher , says : " We have to do it as gradually as possible . It might not be automatically in the reader 's interest to get more and more . " Sharing that belief is Clayton Kirkpatrick , retired chairman of the Chicago Tribune . " People get awfully tired wading through a large , bulky newspaper looking for what they want to read , " he says . Mr. Kirkpatrick 's solution : install computerized equipment to produce and deliver a tailormade , and thus smaller , newspaper to each subscriber 's doorstep . But he 's not holding his breath for such an innovation . " I ca n't think of a publisher who would voluntarily decrease the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such relief , readers irritated by bloated newspapers can always look forward to another recession . The current slump has caused newspaper advertising linage to fall about 5% so far this year , though overall size has n't decreased appreciably . Bigness has its price . As newspaper size balloons , so does the investment in additional delivery trucks and extra newspaper racks . Carriers of the Washington Post have resorted to using supermarket carts or delivering the massive Sunday paper in sections . Advertisers are irked , though , when their preprints start arriving on Washingtonarea doorsteps on Saturdays . " If a sale is supposed to start on Sunday , advertisers do n't want customers showing up on Saturday afternoon , " says Frank Manzon , circulation sales manager of the Post , which has tried unsuccessfully to stop the premature deliveries . Carrying home a hefty paper is challenging in itself . Robert Pridham , a school teacher in Summit , N.J. , has taken to holding the Sunday New York Times gingerly , so that preprints and department store catalogs do n't slide out . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a box , " he says . When he goes out for Sunday brunch with friends , they reserve a separate chair for the Times . Scott Johnson , a Long Beach , Calif. , attorney , says the Los Angeles Times is too big to carry from the newsstand , so he gets it delivered . But home delivery has its problems , too . When the Times lands in his garden . he says . " it knocks the flowers off my primroses . " The first task for some readers when a big paper comes into their home is to make it a smaller paper . Maxwell McCombs , a professor at Syracuse University 's Newhouse School of Communications , reads newspapers backwards , shedding sections along the way . " I just want to get rid of the physical bulk and clear it away , " he says . Dedicated newspaper readers get a break when they go on vacation , but they suffer for it when they get back . Miss Coburn , the Los Angeles free-lance writer , relied on a neighbor to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month last summer . She returned to find three piles of newspapers , each waist-high , in her bedroom . " I felt like a hamster in a cage with all those newspapers piled up , " she says .
