" A year and a half ago we were talking about a laundry list of tough-on-crime legislation , " said John B. Emerson , chief deputy city attorney of Los Angeles , who leads a legislative subcommittee of the Police Officers Association of Los Angeles County . " But the focus of our panel now is very much on preventive measures . There ' s been a very dramatic shift. " // In one city after another , there is acknowledgment that conventional police methods have reached their limits , that on their own they can not solve the drug problem and that the police should have a more direct role in attacking the underlying social causes of drug abuse. // // A Search for Alternatives // " You hear police chiefs saying things they didn ' t say a few years ago , " said Patrick V. Murphy , a former New York City Police Commissioner who is now director of police policy for the United States Conference of Mayors . " Like : ' Do I want to lose a cop in a raid on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my city ? Let ' s talk about alternatives. ' " // Police Chief Isaac Fulwood of Washington said in an interview : " Our best efforts have not stemmed the flow of drugs . We have to do other things . " Chief Charles A. Gruber of Shreveport , La. , said in recent Congressional testimony : " For all our policing , we understand that law enforcement is not the solution to the problem of drugs in our society . " And Sheriff Sherman Block of Los Angeles County , discussing what he regards as a new police role in reducing the demand for drugs , said , " We have come to the conclusion that while many responsibilities belong to other disciplines , if they are not being adequately carried out , at some point we ' ll have to deal with the failure. " // The search for alternatives comes against a backdrop of growing strain on police departments , courts and prisons throughout the country . <> <> Sharp Rise in Slayings // The number of homicides has nearly tripled in just four years in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be drug-related . In Los Angeles County , the District Attorney ' s Office is predicting 515 slayings by local drug gangs this year , as opposed to 212 in 1984 . Forty percent of the 138 people killed in Kansas City , Mo. , this year were listed as drug-related , as were 25 percent of the 96 slayings reported in Columbus , Ohio , which never bothered to record such statistics before this year. // Narcotics officers find that the people they once worked to arrest are often quickly released from overcrowded prisons . New York City jails now hold more than 14 , 000 drug offenders , seven times as many as in 1980 . There were 89 , 112 drug arrests in New York last year , up from 18 , 563 in 1980. // Nationally , the Justice Department says , arrests for drug abuse violations have increased from 162 , 177 in 1968 , or 112 per 100 , 000 people , to 850 , 034 last year , or 450 per 100 , 000 people . And police department overtime budgets , substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Los Angeles , they rose from $6. 8 million four years ago to $18. 5 million for the current fiscal year. // It is the discouragement brought on by these kinds of statistics , along with the lack of manifest results from traditional police methods , that is causing many police officers and officials to believe they themselves have to help try to reduce the drug demand that lies behind the high drug and crime rate . Most of the alternative approaches are still experimental and in the early stages , but they are being seriously tried in thousands of cities . <> <> A Variety of Approaches // Police officers and sheriffs are going into elementary schools in many cities to teach children how to be more assertive and to manage stress , skills needed to resist the lure of drug pushers . The Shreveport Police Department is trying to set up seven centers in poor areas to help young people find prenatal care , jobs and schooling . And in Washington , the police are working with city parks to develop after-school drug-prevention programs. // One program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments is called Drug Abuse Resistance Education , or DARE , set up by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Unified School District . Specially trained police officers go into fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms to give 17 lessons intended to help children learn to resist drugs. // The DARE program has now been adopted by 2 , 000 localities in 49 states , three foreign countries and Department of Defense schools abroad , reaching an estimated three million children this year. // New York City has a similar program , the School Program to Educate and Control Drug Abuse , in which about 100 police officers are now teaching in nearly all the community school districts. // The other day 37 police officers in DARE programs from other parts of California and from departments in Alabama and Minnesota gathered in a hotel conference room in the San Fernando Valley here for instruction in changing hardened street ways into caring teacher skills . <> <> Police Officers as Teachers // It is hardly conventional police training . " We assist them to remove the macho image and become teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentor , who said the program , once dismissed by many officers as the " kiddie cops , " has gained respect. // The police " students " heard Officer Mario J. Valdez talk about public speaking skills and listened intently as Bernice Medinnis , a retired Los Angeles teacher , demonstrated teaching techniques that would help create what she called " very positive expectations " among all children. // The police-education programs in California cost an average of $11. 94 per student annually , for officers ' salaries , school coordination and materials. // Such programs , police officials say , are far cheaper than incarceration . " In Los Angeles alone last year we made over 50 , 000 narcotics-related arrests , more than all the jail beds in California , " said Lieut . Larry Goebel , assistant commanding officer of the Dare program . " If we put them all in jail we ' d fill all the beds in Califonia just from L.A. So this is a bargain . Our philosophy is pay me now or pay me later . It ' s cheaper to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the training session were two officers from Huntsville , Ala . , Lonnie Stone and Thomas Dolleslager . They said that while the approach has strong support from their Police Chief , Richard V. Ottman , there was some resistance within the ranks , partly because the program diverted scarce manpower from enforcement and partly because the vice section believes the problem is best handled by more arrests . There has also been resistance from some educators , although most agree that police officers add a measure of valuable credibility. // In Washington , the Police Department is now working with the Fairline Coalition , a group of citizens that works on crime prevention and with local park workers to give children controlled supervision and drug awareness activities after school. // " We ' ve got to expand those programs , " Chief Fulwood said . " We target kids who are high risk and get them before they get into criminal activity . It ' s cheaper and makes more sense . " The focus on children is a theme that runs through the new police programs , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry special weight with Congress on financing social programs. // " The most eloquent arguments for engaging on the demand-reduction front come from police officers , " Senator Pete Wilson , a moderate Republican who is running for Governor of California , said in an interview . <> <> Truancy Intervention Program // The District Attorney ' s Office in Los Angeles County recently began a truancy intervention program , on the theory that truancy is an early indication of drug problems and crime . Truant children and their parents now meet with lawyers and hearing officers from the prosecutor ' s office , who explain the hard legal consequences of truancy. // " Our premise is that truancy is the first indication of criminal behavior , " said Michael E. Tranbarger , assistant director of the bureau of special operations , which also prosecutes gang crimes . " We decided it was time to look at the beginning of the pipeline instead of concentrating all our resources on the other end , when it ' s too late. " // But police officials say they are strapped for resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 50 officers short . And , like many colleagues , Chief Gruber has been lobbying for more Federal aid for drug enforcement. // But he also beats the drums for what he calls " problem-oriented policing , " by which the police intervene directly to mend social ills . He has applied for a $3 million Federal grant to set up seven " community action " centers in Cedar Grove and other low-income parts of the city to help young people apply for jobs and develop coping skills . <> <> Dubious About More Work // Many departments are strapped to the limits , and some remain dubious about taking on more work. // " We don ' t have time for the education and rehabilitation part , " said Lieut . George Gavito of the Cameron County Sheriff ' s Department in Brownsville , Tex. , a major entry point for illicit drugs on the Mexican border . " Somebody else has to worry about that part . I don ' t think law enforcement should have anything to do with it . It should be handled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law-enforcement officers are expressing such views ; indeed , officers are speaking out philosophically about their reasons for the shifting tactics . What the police have been doing until now in the drug war , said Earl Cronin , president of the Policemen ' s Association in Washington , is " like trying to drain the ocean with a teaspoon. " // In testifying before the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control last month , Chief Gruber , who is president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police , said : " We can certainly add more police , make more arrests , build more jails and increase our capacity to treat addicts . However , this won ' t solve our problem if the inmates who come out of prison and the addicts who come out of treatment centers do not have the skills and/or the opportunities and wherewithal to lead productive lives. " // Few police officers advocate legalizing illicit drugs , as Federal District Judge Robert W. Sweet urged recently in New York , but some sound similar notes in justifying their efforts to broaden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We must recognize the socioeconomic side of this . We ' ve got to have better demand-reduction programs , better treatment facilities . We must build families and communities that have values about murder - that it is not acceptable conduct . When a 13-year-old kid can murder somebody , blow his brains out , and then go home and sleep , there ' s something wrong . " <> <> NEXT : The overwhelmed courts. //
