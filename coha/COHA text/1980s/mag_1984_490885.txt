THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ONE can watch TV day and night for an entire year ( one can but one should n't ) and never see anything else as naked and revealing as the Academy Awards ceremony . The producers of that telecast , commanding , as they do , the ripest fruits of our technological revolution , can show simultaneously the faces of all five nominees for each statuette as the envelope is being opened and the victor announced . The winner , predictably , explodes in the ecstasies so familiar to devotees of the late lamented " Let 's Make a Deal . " True voyeurs , though , should stare at the faces of the losers , who struggle to hold their unflinching grins , all the while applauding as if possessed . And then they turn to their escorts ( if it 's the award for Best Actress ) and nod vigorously , as if to say , " Meryl really deserved it . I knew she would get it . She was wonderful . " When Jesse Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria , the happy reactions of White House officials had a little of that flavor . Even a President who himself attended the Academy Awards in the years before the split screen was devised knew that it would not do to pout . And certainly everyone in the Administration was sincerely , humanly happy to see Lieutenant Goodman get safely home . But Jackson had succeeded where Reagan , and the State Department , failed . Worse for the Administration than Jackson 's success was his method . Taking advantage of his freedom to ignore the channels of diplomacy , and taking advantage also of Reagan 's , and the State Department 's , choosing not to stand in his way , he just went and talked to somebody . Even allowing for all the differences in responsibility , accountability , and formal encumbrance , or lack of encumbrance allowing for the difference between a personal mission and " diplomacy " ? the action pointed up the curious strategy pursued by our government for the last three years . We seem not to want to talk seriously to anybody . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ideological fierceness , by contrast , is the art of never compromising . One can commend this second art for its innate boldness and stylish simplicity , but it is not very pretty  --  especially since in place of red paint it daubs on blood . The Administration 's approach to Nicaragua , for instance , is a masterpiece of this school . Even if one accepts the thesis that the Sandinista government is had news , a Latin gulag busy exporting revolution , there are still two ways of dealing with it . One is to talk , to dicker . This is not a wimpy , left-wing notion ; it is what was once called diplomacy , and our government has engaged in it , with mixed results , since the birth of the Republic , and often with foes far nastier than the Sandinistas . The other way is to threaten to train all our military and economic force on the country , hoping that that will prove pressure enough to reshape it more to our liking . This is what we have done with Nicaragua ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a military machine that kills Nicaraguans every day , sabotages their coffee crop and their oil reserves , and undercuts their government . This is also a tried-and-true method . The novel contribution of the Reagan Administration is to take what was a tactic and make it into an ideological crusade without diplomatic goals . When Nicaragua , perhaps because of the Reagan pressure or perhaps because of a commitment to democracy , announced a series of reforms this fall , Reagan and his men announced them-selves mildly encouraged but not nearly pleased enough to cease encouraging the contras . They adopted a " wait and see " attitude , and said they were watching for evidence of genuine and sincere penitence ; indeed , they seemed to say , now was hardly the time to call off the dogs , just when the pressure was working . That sort of approach has no logical boundary ; the next set of reforms will doubtless he met with demands for yet more changes . And Nicaragua is not the only example : in Grenada and El Salvador , and , by implication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that there will be no compromise . When Lieutenant Goodman was safe-ly on the plane and the initial round of congratulations was out of the way , " a senior White House official " told reporters , " Nobody is overly op-timistic about the Syrians ' being will-ing to play the good guys . " Reagan 's press spokesman termed the release a " gesture " and added that if it were sincere " a gesture of peace would be backed up by deeds " ? in this case , by Syria 's agreeing to toe the American line in Leba-non . Perhaps the President will follow Jackson 's lead ; a few days after Goodman 's release the President did send a note to President Hafez Assad , of Syria , indicating a willingness to talk peace , and some shifting of posi-tions seems to be taking place . If this proves to be the case , it will be a hap-py day , for in the last three years , with one country after another , Rea-gan has behaved like the tourist in the foreign bazaar who insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan is not just hag-gling till he 's cut the price in half ? he wants his souvenirs free . At some point , the friendly native tells him to get lost , and then Reagan feels compelled to resort to a well-known method of obtaining goods and services at no cost , which is to wave a revolver . If the threat does n't work , the trigger will . ? WHEN human beings are in a contemplative mood , they generally seek out a quiet place , where a newborn idea can get up on its feet and take a few trial steps without fear of being run over by a taxi . But there we were in the middle of Times Square the other night , with hundreds of thousands of other people , contemplating . We were contemplating the past , the future , and an apple that would soon be sliding down a pole to announce the arrival of the new year . We stared at the apple for the longest time , wondering what it contained . All the events , personages , and trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting to march forth and do the duty allotted them by destiny ? Or a mere tangle of wires and filaments ? We wondered , also , what resolution we could possibly make that would be adequate to the perils and temptations of the New Year but within our ability to keep . Then our eyes  --  and our thoughts  --  wandered over some of the marquees , billboards , and neon signs that make Times Square Times Square : the most changeable of urban places , subject like no other to the influence of the passing fancy and the quick buck . And lately the changes have been coming faster than ever . None of the mighty billboards that look down this season on the concrete clearing where Broadway and Seventh Avenue meet have been around for anything like as long as the now vanished Camel sign , which puffed its way into our affections years ago . But as we scanned the rooftops we could not help noticing a certain pattern in the names we saw there : Minolta , Fuji , Canon , Aiwa , Sony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alphabet , we might have been in downtown Tokyo . The Japanese have taken over Times Square , and their conquest is proclaimed in such colossal letters and glaring colors  --  the Fuji people have installed a hypnotic , on-again , off-again wall of brilliant green to command our attention to the " official film of 1984 Olympic Games " ? that even the most xenophilous among us may feel a twinge of alarm . Where was Kodak , we 'd like to know , when Fuji got that Olympic gig ? Visions of laid-off auto workers and steel workers filled our head , and we began preparing a resolution to " buy American . " But the apple had yet to begin its descent , and while we waited we had second thoughts . It would be a tricky business . Brand names certainly JANUARY 16 , 1984 could n't be counted on  --  not with R.C.A. and General Electric commissioning products from Hitachi and Matsushita . And should we enforce our vow retroactively , combing the closet and the desk for every foreign-made sock or ballpoint pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reflected , by what right do we place a higher value on the livelihood of those who speak the same language and sing the same national anthem we do than on the livelihood of the Japanese , the Koreans , the Brazilians , and all the other peoples who have lately begun to send their finished goods across the oceans ? We Americans can hardly have expected to enjoy forever the extraordinary position in which we found ourselves after the Second World War . If we have to yield up some of our privileges , should n't we do so gracefully rather than grudgingly ? And if we are to become a less conspicuous and less dominant member of the world community , wo n't some countries , inevitably , wind up selling us more than we sell them ? And , if so , why not Japan ? The Japanese , like Manhattanites , are islanders , who use up far more in the way of energy than they produce , but they have found a way to stay afloat . We  --  the United States , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , a constitution , and a number of very good ideas . Most impor-tant , perhaps , we relieved them of their weapons and , to a great extent , of the burden of making weapons ? surely one of the big-gest favors that any nation has ever done another in the history of the world . If you now stand any-where on the archipelago of traffic islands which stretches from Forty-third Street to Forty-seventh Street and gaze upward , you will see powerful evi-dence that the Japanese have not forgotten the source of all this largesse . It is only because they know us so well that they can supply us so well , and although their slavish study of American culture can be dismissed as a calculated business policy we suspect that it has also been an affair of the heart . If the Commerce Department kept balance-of-trade staTHE NEW YOKK.ER. tistics for intangible things like sports and ways of dressing , we suspect that the United States would emerge , even now , with an overwhelming surplus in its dealings with almost every country on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries of all . There has been a lot of talk in the last few years about the need for American businesses to try the techniques of Japan 's success  --  cooperative management , better quality control , more attention to the long term , more emphasis on education , and so forth . We ourself do n't dispute the wisdom of any of this advice , but it struck us , standing in Times Square on New Year 's Eve , that the Japanese may have another lesson to offer  --  a lesson that is far more timely . Losing a war and being an island nation seem to have encouraged in them a certain humility and curiosity about the rest of the world which have proved to he as advantageous as they are admirable . ? Incident at the Thalia WE slipped out of the office at lunchtime the other day and made our way to the Thalia Theatre , on ' West Ninety-fifth Street , for the opening of the Thalia 's Katsu retrospective . This event had been described in the theatre 's fall program as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as featuring " eleven films starring Shintaro Katsu  --  in his best-known role as the scruffy blind super-samurai Zatoichi and other action-packed movies that have made him one of Japan 's most popular stars . " The film that opened the series , " The Devil 's Temple , " was certainly action-packed . It had been made in l969 and was set in ancient times , during a period when rival emperors in separate capitals struggled for control of the country , causing people to flee from the fighting in the cities . " The Devil 's Temple " has only four characters : a warrior turned bandit , who is an incredibly fierce fellow  --  played , of course , by Katsu  --  and has taken refuge in an abandoned temple ; his girlfriend , a stunningly attractive and self-assured former dancer , who is there with him ; his long-suffering wife , who comes to the temple in the hope of taking her husband back to Kyoto ; and a high priest from a temple on the mountain . From the moment the wife arrives , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she stays on . They are cruel to her , but she perseveres . She is heartened by the appearance of the high priest , thinking that he will help her husband to see the light . But he , it seems , is a former nobleman who , years before , discovered earthly desires in the company of this same former dancer . The warrior is fearful of the priest 's supernatural powers , but his girlfriend tells him not to worry  --  she knows how to keep the priest in his place . And then , as the wife serves her husband his favorite meal in another room of the temple ( he is in a rage , as usual ) , the former dancer tempts the priest . She is supremely confident , and heads of sweat break out on the tormented priest 's brow . Suddenly , the film stopped and the houselights went on . Had the film broken ? Were the reels being changed ? Two young theatre employees , each wearing a Thalia T-shirt , walked slowly through the audience , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employees said in a loud voice , " Folks , I 'm sorry . We do n't have the last ten minutes of the film . This is all the distributor sent us . " A man in the third row stood up and said , as if he were beginning a speech , " Sir , am I given to understand that your distributor did not check the film before sending it to you ? And that you , too , failed to ? " The theatre employee interrupted . " I 'm terribly sorry , sir . This movie has n't been shown in this country for at least two years , and there is no other print available . However , I have located someone in the audience who once saw the film and will tell us how it ends . " He nodded to a young man in the smoking section , who seemed a trifle embarrassed at being the center of attention . " I have n't seen it in a long time , " the young man said , without standing , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For whom , may I ask ? " demanded the man in the third row . " For the wife , perhaps , or for the dancer ? " " For the wife , " the young man said . " She gets him back . " Someone else shouted , " What about the priest ? What happens to him ? " The young man said , " I am afraid he is a priest no more . " As the next feature , " Gate of Hell , " began , the two theatre employees made their way through the audience again , handing out passes to a future performance . When they offered one to us , we said , " No , thanks . It 's all right , " and left to catch the subway downtown . A Different Time HAVING been put off by the total crush of the Manet show at the Met , where one could hardly get enough oxygen to breathe , let alone room to see the pictures , we did n't get to the Wildenstein Gallery 's loan exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the end of the year . We would like to have gone again and again . La Revue Blanche was an art and literary magazine published in Paris between 1891 and 1903 by three brothers  --  Alfred , Thadee , and Alexandre Natanson . They were young , they were adventurous , they had money , and they had taste . La Revue Blanche was not a luxury periodical ; its illustrations consisted mainly of drawings . Thadee was married at the time to a young Polish woman , a talented pianist , who had studied with the composer Gabriel Faure : Misia Godebska , better remembered today as Misia Sert . ( Jose-Maria Sert , the painter of gigantic murals , became her third husband . Her second was the financier Alfred Edwards . ) She was known simply as Misia . The painters painted her and the writers wrote about her . She became the muse of La Revue Blanche . In 1893 , the flighty young Proust , the " little Marcel " of the salons , who nobody thought would amount to much , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merged it with La Revue Blanche . He contributed a critique of obscurantism , and also fragments and what he called etudes , which were later incorporated into his first book , " The Pleasures and the Days . " The brilliant young Leon Blum ( who in 1936 became France 's first Socialist Premier ) was the literary critic for La Revue Blanche from 1896 until 1900 , when the novelist Andre Gide replaced him . At about the same time , and for almost a year , Claude Debussy wrote about music for the review . He was a gifted critic  --  frank , independent , and very funny . He wrote under the pseudonym Monsieur Croche ( Mr. Quaver ) . The poet Stephane MaIlarme , who wrote with great difficulty , gave the review a poem as early as 1892 , and followed it with other poems and some prose pieces . Guillaume Apollinaire , the poet who later became a champion of Cubism , published several stories there . The review was a success throughout its lifetime , but , little by little , the Natansons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been casually handled , and the brothers lost money steadily until , all of a sudden , they decided to liquidate it . The four artists most closely associated with La Revue Blanche were Bonnard , Toulouse-Lautrec , the Swiss Vallotton , and Vuillard . Others , such as Renoir , were involved through friendship with the Natansons . Still others were strongly defended in its pages : Pissarro , Gauguin ( his " NoaNoa , " a Tahitian memoir in the form of a journal , was originally published in the review ) , Cezanne , Redon , Serusier , and Picasso . The Wildenstein exhibit showed them all ( except Renoir ) , and several others who painted during the time of La Revue Blanche . We saw an exquisite Cezanne still-life of an apple , a lemon , a pear , and a pomegranate . We saw visionary Redons ( " La Pen-see " as a black-winged female nude perched on a rock against a crimson sky ) . We saw lovely Seurats and a solitary Pissarro , warmly lit interiors by Vuillard , Toulouse-Lautrec 's " Tristan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The exhibition was conceived , organized , and catalogued by Georges Bernier . Joyce Hartke , who is the coordinator of exhibits at Wildenstein 's , joined us for a moment in front of a four-panel screen by Bonnard . " It 's a lithograph , " Mrs. Hartke said . " It was the only screen we could find that was still in good condition . Is n't this a lovely show ? People come in asking , What is La Revue Blanche ? ' amatzaciaaganzgraau , tratioacannuntradonon **26;7035;TOOLONG PIZzii N.thibrstaitiLltitittadd ROUSE annunteannemaclua waiarillIZEGMOROODO == -- =-A= PIZZA HOUSE q ip , , .411141 , ? = . rilt ' ' ) ei:l ' il1 " 11111 MOM I : : 44 ' 51510 ' ' A. ' : ' ir.61 i : Or , Aid ? ' They 've never heard of it . Such a pity . " As we were thinking of Misia , and of how once , while decorating her apartment , she cut the straight edges of a Bonnard frieze into scalloped shapes , Mrs. Hartke asked , " Do you by any chance know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Misia 's biography ? " We said that indeed we did . What we gathered from seeing both the Manet show and the show at the Wildenstein was that just about all the artists of that period  --  painters , writers , musicians  --  had been held together by an extraordinarily taut and complicated web of intimacy . Manet painted Berthe Morisot again and again . Not only was she married to his brother but she was a marvellous painter , and a beauty as well . Manet painted the luscious Wry Laurent , a small-time actress and big-time courtesan , who was his mistress . Later , she had a long liaison with Mallarme . Later still , the flighty young Proust pursued her in the salons , much to Mallarmes annoyance . And Manet painted a beautiful and very touching portrait of Mallarme , with his walrus mustache . Vuillard and Bonnard shared a close and cloudless friendship that began in their student days and lasted until Vuillard 's death , in 1940 . Vuillard painted Bonnard at his easel . He painted Thadee and Misia in their pattern-on-pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Vuillard painted Vallotton ; Vallotton painted Thadee . And everybody painted Misia at her piano . And Misia played for Mallarme . He said that she inspired him . After we left Wildenstein 's , we thought of a photograph we had seen there . It was taken by Degas in 1896 , and showed Mallarme and Paule Gobillard sitting under a Manet . Paule Gobillard was a niece of Berthe Morisot 's . When Paule and her two sisters were orphaned , they came to live with their aunt in her house on the Rue de Villejust  --  now Rue Paul Valery . Valery , a poet and diplomat , married Paule 's sister Jeanne and settled in that house , which still belongs to their family . We thought of Mallarme . During the day , he taught English in a lycde . His Tuesday evenings came into their own with the publication of La Revue Blanche . His apartment , on the Rue de Rome , was small , but everybody went there . The poet Paul Verlaine . Valery . Gide . The playwright and diplomat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painters Whistler , Munch , " I , on the other hand , find it frustrating that we have more missiles than we know what to do with . " Redon , Gauguin , Vuillard . On Mallarme 's walls hung a Mallet , a Whistler portrait of Mallarme 's daughter , a Berthe Morisot of the little boat he kept at Valvins , near Fontainebleau , and a Monet of which Mallarme said , " I must have picked a good one , for when I pointed at it he blanched . " ? WE thought of Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale . They play the piano like angels , write beautifully about 11 , lisia , are wonderful to talk to , and cook formidably besides . We called them up and said we felt like talking about La Revue Blanche . They invited us over . We hopped on the Hampton Jitney and disembarked two hours later , stumbling in a foot of snow , at the kitchen doorstep of their house , a lovely old one on Flying Point Road , in Water Mill . Soon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a window that revealed the snow-swept scene . Robert Fizdale was at the stove , making lunch . " I have some aged Parmesan , " Fizdale said . " Do you like your omelette hazeuse ? " We ate it with pain grille , and afterward drank tea and talked . " There was a spirit of intimacy about the group , " Gold said . " Thadee was the real hero of La Revue Blanche . He and Misia had actually bought the paintings that hung on their walls . Misia was conscious of the French , the very French , concept of le petit-maitre . Vuillard and Bonnard were at once great painters and petits-maitres . Lucien Guitry  --  you know , Guitry the actor  --  gave his son Sacha a movie camera for his seventeenth birthday , and Sacha asked all his father 's friends to pose , and they all accepted except Degas . So Sacha hid in a doorway and photographed Degas walking down the street . The film still exists . " Fizdale said , " It was an uncommercial period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he finished the portrait Misia sent him a note with a blank check and told Renoir to fill it in . Remember that I 'm a very rich woman , ' she wrote . Renoir filled in a rather modest sum , and when Misia reprimanded him he said that no painting by a living artist was worth more . " " They all lived for art , " Gold said . " They did work for each other . And they all spent their summers in Valvins . Thadee and Misia went there because of Mallarme . He was two doors down . Redon was across the river . The scale in Valvins is so intimate . Thadee and Misia 's house is tiny . Vuillard and Bonnard must have slept upstairs , on the floor . There just was n't any room . " " The atmosphere must have been steamy  --  intense and emotional , " Gold said . " Lautrec and his cousin came . They were all so young . And in love with Misia . " Fizdale said , " Thadee and Misia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were poor , but they had ambition  --  real ambition . They wanted their work recognized . Bonnard wrote hundreds of letters to Misia . We discovered their existence only recently . " Gold said , " Mallarme wrote the most wonderful letters . So simple . He writes about food  --  you know , English biscuits  --  and at the end of a summer he says , ' At last , the country has reverted to its natural inhabitants . ' They all knew that larger is less . It was a different time . Tender intimacy was the ruling factor . "
