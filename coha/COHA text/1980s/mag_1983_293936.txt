CLASS : A GUIDE THROUGH THE AMERICAN STATUS SYSTEM by Paul Fussell ; Summit ; 202 pages ; $13.95 <P> In the ' 50s , books like Russell Lynes ' The Tastemakers and Vance Packard 's The Status Seekers were read by apprehensive Americans eager to appear just a little classier than they were . Their expectations implied that class was a matter not of birth and inheritance but of accomplishment and style . As a system , class belonged to a Europe of social barriers and humiliations that no American would stand for . <P> Or so it was believed . Paul Fussell , 59 , a Pasadena-born Anglophile and former professor of English at Rutgers , asserts that there are nine rigid castes in the U.S. They range from the out-of-sight rich living off capital in grand seclusion , to the destitute , who are also well hidden . In between are various levels of uppers , middles and " proles , " Shaw 's and Orwell 's abbreviation of proletariat , now Fussell 's gleefully derogatory term for blue-collar workers . <P> The author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not out to win votes . His aim is to offend , mainly the middle class , and to decry the decline of culture and taste . He succeeds , with considerable wit and a fine malice , but it is hard to take him seriously . Having revealed the stratagems and pretensions of everyone able and willing to read his book , Fussell emerges as an upscale bohemian . His ideal social category is the " X " class , a cosmopolitan elite who speak several languages , drink excellent cheap wine , never have to be at work on time and whistle Beethoven quartets . <P> Fussell commits some glaring acts of omission as well . The special status of political leaders , heads of corporation , celebrities and the most successful criminals is ignored . He begs off discussing religion as a class indicator and totally neglects race , the great divisor . <P> But cutting prose and a cranky confidence make Fussell a formidable exploiter of status anxiety . Imagine how many college stickers will quietly disappear from the family cars after uneasy readers learn that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by association . The news that better sorts wear only navy blue and gray should seal the musty fate of millions of brown suits , and dinner-party hostesses may never get another compliment after the pronouncement that upper classes find praise rude , " possessions there being of course beautiful , expensive and impressive , without question . " <P> <P> When Fussell is not dreaming of his happy band of Xs , he seems most at home in the upper-middle class . From this vantage he decodes its symbols and looks down at variations in the lower stratas . Driveways , of all things , strike him with deep significance . Curved is preferred over straight because more land is used , suggesting that the owner has plenty to spare . Gravel , particularly if it is beige , surpasses asphalt because it is more difficult to maintain . <P> Prestige attached to garages re mains unsettled , but the family car had better not be a Mercedes , Rolls or Cadillac . Fussell assures us that the best upper-middles drive plain American models that are permanently dulled by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggest that one of your residences is in a place so unpublic that the roads to it are not even paved , " indeed are hardly passable by your ordinary vulgar automobile .
