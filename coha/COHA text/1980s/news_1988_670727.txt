Now Ms. Hepper has a solo show , at the Rosa Esman Gallery , and many questions have been answered . Of the eight works , half are freestanding and half reliefs . In all but one , the hide or fish skin wrapped around previous works is gone . A work may include different kinds of wood , as well as different kinds of movement , and there are always multiple points of view . " Ring " is composed of round and angular forms suggesting the fossils of hunting and fishing gear that have been intertwined and pinned to the wall : the gear itself has become the trophy . The sculptures have a command and unpredictability they did not have before. // Ms. Hepper ' s feeling for wood , process and craft go very deep . In the meticulous way her branches seem to have been gathered , cut , scraped and bundled together , there is the sense of watching an artist working and thinking . The gathering , cutting , bending and tying are part of the organic content . The craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bond between us and her. // There is something of Martin Puryear in the feeling for wood and craft , and something of Lee Bontecou in the feeling for the circular void . These works also belong to the long tradition of modern sculptural cages and traps . But with a difference . While Ms. Hepper ' s loops and circles suggest actual animal traps , her works are not about anxiety and danger . They do not threaten to close around us . While from up close , the loops of " Snare " resemble nooses , from across the gallery the sculpture begins to draw itself in space , and the lines suggest not menace but the song of dewy spider webs in high grass at dawn. // Ms. Hepper is 34 years old , and like many other artists of her generation , she is involved with synthesis . What is being synthesized is unusual . In " Concentric Shift , " the network of lines suggests a Russian Constructivist head . But from another angle , the work turns into an Oceanic mask . Utopian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time they seemed to be driving modern sculptors in opposite directions . But both are now part of the contemporary sculptor ' s museum without walls , and in Ms. Hepper ' s work , both have a place. // The need for synthesis is reflected in the attitude toward point of view . The sculptures in this show do not have a front or back . They bring different orientations together . The sculptures not only change as we move around them , but they also change between near and far . " Two-Stroke Roll , " with its circles of different density and color , can resemble a large wheel that has just shot off a wagon and begun to break apart . From a distance , however , the image picks up speed , and the wheel purrs on . Ms. Hepper is now rolling , too. // The sculptures of Carol Hepper remain at the Rosa Esman Gallery , 70 Greene Street , through Nov. 19 . <> <> Ross Bleckner <> Mary Boone Gallery <> 417 West Broadway ( at Spring Street ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the artists committed to bringing new content to geometric abstraction . All seven paintings in this show are elegiac and nocturnal . In each one , a lush , essentially monochromatic ground is dotted with light that seems on , or behind , or reflected in the surface . Sometimes the dots change shape , hatching birds and tiny hands . A hand may be stigmatized by light , or white light may pour from it in liquid form. // The paintings are about loss and celebration . They suggest abandon and restraint , provocation and commemoration . With the hard , deep blues and greens , the spaces have the feeling of dark ballrooms and smoky corridors and streets untouched by light . Sometimes the lights seem suspended , like candles in a church . Other times , their circular movement is vertiginous , and light spins as it would in the head of someone drunk in bed at night . This blend of throbbing noise and impenetrable silence is part of what gives Mr. Bleckner ' s work its edge. // The mixture of presence and absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no clear form , no clear space , but the thickly glazed surfaces create an impression of transparency , and this arouses the desire to look into them hard and long - as if there had to be something there . But there isn ' t . The paintings seem to be bottomless , but there is only reflection and surface . Faith in the authority of the surface remains - for the moment - absolute. // The problem with this show is the size . These are highly personal , commemorative paintings in which Mr. Bleckner may be trying to establish a dialogue with Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman . The tone is such that there should be no more than three or four of them . The 24 small works on paper , which hatch various animal , mineral and vegetable shapes that manage to suggest and keep their distance from the natural world , should have been saved for another show . <> <> Tom Doyle <> Sculpture Center <> 167 East 69th Street <> Through tomorrow // For those who were aware of Tom Doyle as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show may be a surprise . It contains four large sculptures and a number of small reliefs , and they are filled with religious imagery . All are economical , made with a few beams of wood from wild cherry trees the artist cut himself . All the sculptures are gestural , reminiscent of Franz Kline , whose expressive and economical slabs of paint influenced so many sculptors of Mr. Doyle ' s generation. // The large sculptures are about movement and they are about gravity . They seem to be the first stages in a new artistic version of the Stations of the Cross . In an accompanying statement , Mr. Doyle writes that he has been " haunted " by Grunewald ' s Isenheim Altarpiece and by " the solitary high Celtic crosses of Ireland . " These sculptures also resemble flying buttresses that have sprung to life. // " Mac McCool " is the show stopper . It occupies a corner at the end of the gallery and it kicks out into the space with the force of a mule . But the beams also form a cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been built into them . The three other freestanding sculptures , all with intimations of the cross , all with intimations of bearing enormous weight , seem oriented around this climactic work. // As effective as the sculptures are , there are problems . The separateness of individual beams and the conspicuousness of the joints produces a generalized abstract element that contrasts sharply with the specific expressive content . In addition , although these sculptures occupy space , they are really only coherent from one or two points of view . From those points of view , however , they have real power . <> <> Ziva Kronzon <> Bertha Urdang Gallery <> 23 East 74th Street <> Through tomorrow // Ziva Kronzon is an Israeli sculptor who now lives primarily in New York . She makes plaster molds , then shapes paper inside them . Then she paints the cast paper black . The paper sculptures look like metal . With their suggestion of columns , pails , stovepipes and safes , many are identified with holding and support , yet all seem nonfunctional , and all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticks of dynamite seem perched on two cartons . Ms. Kronzon ' s surfaces are like flesh scarred by fire and transience. // But the works are , in the end , upbeat . The surfaces are far less fragile than they seem . And the show suggests a war-zone playpen . In " Vessels , " a line of 20 inverted pails strung together from the wall onto the floor has the upright wackiness of the caterpillar in " Alice in Wonderland . " The positive tone has to do not only with wit , but also with confidence in the ability to wed the Middle Eastern world in which the artist was born and the America in which she now lives . Fire is branded into these works , but so are the creative imaginations of Eva Hesse , John Chamberlain and John Duff. //
