Why share power ? Solidarity leader Lech Walesa could see no good reason last week as he turned down an invitation from President Wojciech Jaruzelski to join a grand coalition government with the Communist Party . After a two-hour closed meeting with Jaruzelski at the President 's residence in Warsaw 's Belvedere Palace , Walesa declared , " I must say I do n't envy the President . He has an awful lot of problems . " <P> Rather than joining the Communists , Walesa said , he told Jaruzelski that Solidarity should be permitted to form its own government . The trade-union movement earned that right , the union leader declared , with its dramatic June 4 election victory , in which its candidates captured all 161 seats that were open to it in the 460-seat Sejm , or lower house , and 99 of the 100 seats in the Senate . Said he : " The only sensible decision would be to give power to those forces that have the support of the majority of the electorate . " <P> Jaruzelski offered Walesa seven of 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health , industry , environment and housing . Again Walesa refused , on the grounds that only a Solidarity government would have enough support to carry out the tough austerity measures needed to ease Poland 's economic crisis . A junior role in a coalition government would implicate Solidarity in that crisis without giving it the means to bring about significant change . " By remaining in opposition , " said Walesa , " we can make sure that the government does n't leave the road to reform . " <P> Jaruzelski did not reject outright the idea of a Solidarity government , but , according to Walesa , preferred to press ahead with a plan to form a Communist- led coalition . Jaruzelski " must take on all the responsibility for the formation of a new government , " said Walesa . " For my part , I intend to form a shadow cabinet to prepare for the measures that sooner or later will become inevitable . " In fact , Walesa created a 15-member shadow cabinet last December ; its role then was to formulate the trade union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the June elections . <P> Jozef Slisz , the leader of Rural Solidarity and deputy speaker of the Senate , was among other opposition officials who met with Jaruzelski . He said the President explained he could not allow Solidarity to form a government , because several of Poland 's East bloc neighbors would " look at this askance . " Specifically , Jaruzelski mentioned East Germany , Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union . <P> Later in the week the President took the extraordinary step of announcing his resignation as party leader , a position he has held since 1981 , when he took power largely to crack down on Solidarity . Jaruzelski also withdrew from the Politburo and the Central Committee , reportedly so that he can concentrate all his energy on the presidency . <P> Jaruzelski was replaced by outgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski , who was elected by a Central Committee secret ballot , 171 to 41 . In his acceptance speech , Rakowski proposed an unspecified reshuffling of the party 's top leadership and declared , " I believe I will have the support of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last elections . I would like to change this unfavorable situation into a favorable one . "
