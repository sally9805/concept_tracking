The day ' s developments raised the strong possibility that the President might win when the Senate votes on the $8. 5 billion sale tomorrow at 5 P.M. // The Senators will vote on a resolution of disapproval aimed at preventing the President from carrying out the sale of five Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft , air-to-air fighter plane missiles and other equipment . The House has previously passed such a resolution . <> <> ' Changed My Mind , ' Jepsen Says // One of the most surprising developments of the day , especially to his former comrades in the group opposing the sale , was the announcement by Senator Roger W. Jepsen , Republican of Iowa , that , after months in the role of a leader of the anti-sale group , he would now vote to support the President. // " Nothing much has changed but me , " Senator Jepsen told reporters crowded into the Senate press gallery , " and I have changed my mind. " // In addition to Senator Jepsen ' s switch , four Democratic Senators and // One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and changed his mind tells what prompted him to switch his vote . Page A12. <> four Republicans who had not previously made firm statements about their intentions revealed that they would vote for the sale . The Democrats were David L. Boren of Oklahoma , J. James Exon of Nebraska , Walter D. Huddleston of Kentucky and John Melcher of Montana . The Republicans were Bob Dole of Kansas , Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska and Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico . Mr. Dole gave his position in remarks to reporters , rather than in a formal speech or written statement. <> <> 52 Still Formally Opposed // These announcements left 52 Senators still on public record as opposed to the sale , 47 supporting the President and one still unannounced . He is Russell B. Long of Louisiana , a senior Democratic member. // A staff assistant to the majority leader , Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee , said this evening that " neither side now has 51 votes . " It was widely assumed in the Senate , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least force a tie . In case of a tie , the resolution of disapproval would not be adopted and the President would win. // A leader of the forces opposing the sale said he believed that Senator Slade Gorton , Republican of Washington , and Senator Mark Andrews , Republican of North Dakota , would switch from being sponsors of the veto resolution to sup-ju <> port of the sale . This would mean victory for the President , if true , unless Senator Long voted against the Awacs deal. // In Richmond , Va. where he was campaigning for Marshall Coleman , the Republican candidate for Governor , President Reagan said : " We need the good will of the Saudis , not only because they provide oil , but because they are a moderating force in the Middle East . A vote against the sale will close them out of the peace progress. " // The President said he would " never risk the security of Israel . " Israel ' s security , he declared , depends on a stable peace in the Middle East , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs such as the Saudis in the peace process . " He described the Senate ' s vote tomorrow as " vital to America , vital to the West , vital to Israel and vital to peace in the Middle East. " // Many of the opponents of the Awacs sale were pessimistic this evening - a few almost bitter - as a hectic day of political horsetrading ended. // A common theme among the Senators who announced they would support the President was the assertion that to veto the Awacs sale would weaken Mr. Reagan ' s prestige and his ability to conduct foreign policy . <> <> Variety of Factors Cited // But a wide variety of other explanations and factors were also mentioned by those who declared their positions today . Senator Boren said the President had included a passage about physical security arrangements in Saudi Arabia for Awacs planes that the Senator had suggested . Senator Murkowski said he had been told that equipment to " enhance " the capability of F-15 fighter planes would not be delivered for four years - a statement promptly disputed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " highly classified information , " which he would not discuss or describe , that lessened his fear that the sale endangered Israeli security or threatened the loss of sensitive United States military technology. // In answer to a question , he also said he had been told that if the radar surveillance planes were not sold to Saudi Arabia , the Saudis might exert pressure on Spain not to renew the agreement permitting United States military bases in Spanish territory . He would not disclose who had told him this. // Mr. Jepsen had for some time declared himself to be one of the strongest supporters of Israel . However , an Israeli official said today that his switch did not stem from a change of opinion by Israel about the sale . The Israeli Ambassador , Ephraim Evron , told Senator Jepsen in a private conversation today that Israel still viewed the transfer of Awacs as a threat to its security. // In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee last April , Mr. Jepsen said that " this sale to an unstable country jeopardizes our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He added , " I pledge my efforts and my vote to block this sale . " <> <> Mail From Home a Factor // Senator Jepsen said that he had campaigned for the Senate as a " hired man " for the voters of Iowa and that in recent weeks his mail from home had " overwhelmingly " supported the President and the Awacs sale. // To be sure of victory in the Senate , the President and Senator Baker will apparently have to have at least two more members switch from the opposition column , as Senator Jepsen did today . Senator Andrews appeared to be one likely prospect . He told associates he was concerned about such developments as " Greece going Socialist " and was worried about the President ' s ability to maintain world leadership. // More than half a dozen other Senators also seemed to be possible converts to Mr. Reagan ' s side . However , strong opponents of the sale such as Senator Alan Cranston , Democrat of California , the minority leader , were reluctant tonight to concede defeat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they contended . <> <> Letter From Reagan Delayed // The statements of several Senators who declared their positions today mentioned a letter , described by Mr. Boren as a " letter of certification , " that President Reagan is purportedly planning to send to the Senate . The letter was conceived several weeks ago as a method by which the President would assure the Senate that he would obtain agreements about certain terms and conditions of the sale that are not now in writing or are not yet signed. // However , the deputy White House press secretary , Larry Speakes , said in a telephone interview that the letter might not be made public and would not be delivered to the Senate " leadership " until tomorrow . Although the letter was to have described the understandings reached with Saudi Arabia , White House sources explained that it had been delayed so as to include passages requested or suggested by individual Senators whose votes were being solicited. // Senator Boren said , " If we find four years from now that this transfer would not contribute to peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured us the transfer will not take place. " // Senator Grassley was another Senator who said the four-year period before the first Awacs was to be delivered " gives the U.S. ample opportunity to respond if any shift in geopolitical conditions indicates that this sale is not in the best interests of the American people . " <> <> Draft Circulated on Capitol Hill // A draft of the White House letter circulated on Capitol Hill last week did not make the sale contingent on Saudi participation in peace negotiations in the Middle East , but said that the President would " not hesitate " to cancel delivery if Saudi behavior was disruptive of " stability. " // The sense of political momentum generated by the President ' s lobbying efforts and Mr. Baker ' s skillful timing and orchestration led at times to nearly hectic scenes . As word spread that the two Iowa Senators , Mr. Jepsen and Mr. Grassley , were coming to the press gallery to announce support , Senator Exon of Nebraska took to the floor and began giving his speech . He was scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and his staff had said that he would not announce his position until tomorrow. // Senator Melcher began writing out his statement after the Jepsen-Grassley news conference , and took the floor late in the afternoon to declare his support for the sale. //
