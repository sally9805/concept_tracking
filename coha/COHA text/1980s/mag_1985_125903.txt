On Dec. 11 , 1935 , The New York Times reported that New York City 's Downtown Athletic Club had awarded a trophy to the University of Chicago 's All-America halfback , Jay Berwanger , for being the " most valuable football player east of the Mississippi . " The award was new , a project of several members whose aim in establishing it was to give recognition to each season 's top collegiate gridiron star in the East . One of the trophy 's supporters was the club 's athletic director , John W. Heisman  --  but within a year of that first award , Heisman was dead , felled by bronchial pneumonia . The club decided to name the trophy after him and to make players from both sides of the Mississippi eligible . Awarded each year in December , the Heisman has become college football 's greatest honor . // The first man to win it is now a successful businessman active in his community of Oak Brook , a suburb of Chicago . Fifty years ago , however , the nation 's sportswriters called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one-man team . " Grantland Rice called him " the ablest all-around back of the entire crop " and , like almost everyone else , picked the 6-foot , 195-pound Berwanger for his 1935 All-America team . To his coach , Clark Shaughnessy , he was " every football coach 's dream player . " // What did Berwanger do to earn such plaudits ? In 23 varsity games in three seasons with the Maroons he scored 22 touchdowns and kicked 20 extra points . He gained 1,839 yards on 439 rushes for a 4.2 average . As a sophomore , he played 60 minutes of every Big Ten conference game and was voted the team 's MVP . During his collegiate career he returned 54 kickoffs and punts for a 31.8-yard average , completed 50 of 146 passes for 921 yards and caught 12 passes himself for 189 yards . He averaged 38 yards on 233 punts and 46.3 yards on 34 kickoffs. // By today 's standards , Berwanger 's stats are not overwhelming , but college football in the mid- ' 30s was very different from today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other top national teams played only an eight-game schedule . In those days there were no offensive and defensive teams ; everyone played both ways . Berwanger was a 60-minute man , and his defensive game was outstanding , too . In several games he led the Maroon team in tackles and assists . // The game Berwanger remembers best was his final one , a 7-6 triumph over archrival Illinois . With the Maroons trailing 6-0 late in the third period , Berwanger received an Illini punt at midfield and , shaking off five players , streaked to the one-yard line before being dropped . After calling two plays to his fullback that were stopped for no gain , Berwanger took the ball himself and catapulted into the end zone . Then he dropped back to place-kick what proved to be the winning extra point . It was heroics like this , along with his statistics , that got Berwanger his trophy in New York . // John Jacob ( Jay ) Berwanger grew up in the Mississippi River town of Dubuque , Iowa , one of five children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wrestling and track and especially as a widely publicized all-state football running back . At Chicago , he majored in business and , to meet his expenses , waited on tables , cleaned the gym and ran elevators. // After graduating in 1936 , Berwanger got a job with a sponge-rubber company in Chicago  --  and his bronze trophy became a doorstop in his aunt 's house . A Navy pilot during World War II , Berwanger later returned to Chicago to form Jay Berwanger , Inc. , a manufacturers ' rep for molded rubber and plastic products . Now 71 and prosperous , Berwanger is hardly ready for retirement : " The older you get the better you get , " he says . // He still loves football and enjoys reminiscing about the " swell bunch of fellows " who were his teammates . The historic trophy that Berwanger received 50 years ago this month no longer serves as a doorstop . Since 1978 , when he presented it to the University of Chicago , it has had pride of place in the Jay Berwanger Trophy Room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
