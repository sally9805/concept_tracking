( Form GL16A-20M ) MAMMOTH MAIL ORDER CO. , Los ANGELES , CALIF . May 2 DEAR SIRS : Were you in the Army ? It does not seem possible that so complete a snafu could be accomplished without special training . Let me start from the beginning . I will use simple words . Somehow , I have not made myself clear . Maybe that is why my stories always come back . But I am going to try my best , tired as I am and late as the hour may be . Now . On March 7 I ordered a dictionary , No. 339B188GL , Unabridged , India Paper Edition , $32.50 , postpaid . On the afternoon of March 23 1 was in deep thought when a voice called , " William ! William Shakespeare ! " I ignored it . " Shakespeare ! " the voice called . " Mail ! " I arose from the cot and went out . The person who had called me was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , Miss Adeline Yost , Red Bluff , Calif . In case you contact this person , however , may I suggest the use of extreme care ? Do not be misled by a pretty face and a charming manner , or make my mistake in assuming the corn-fed type will leave you alone if you leave it alone . What I mean , sirs , the pink cheeks and open manner may be but a mask for a power-mad personality . If you should drop this person a polite little mimeograph , do not be surprised if said person attempts to assume management of the Mammoth Mail Order Co . I am advising you from personal experience . 1 came out into the hills for privacy and seclusion necessary to my literary career . And the mere act of thumbing a ride to town one day led to -- Well , sirs , the following will illustrate the extent to which this person was trying to dictate my life : She had arrived in her father 's pickup . " Look at your eyes , " she said as I emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sleeping again . " " I was , " I corrected , " thinking . " " Maybe this time you do need rest . Oh , Horace . I 'm so glad . I never did believe you were just a lazy bum , not worth the powder and lead to blow yourself to hell . 1 always did say you were worth the powder and lead . " " Was there mail , " I asked cautiously , " or did you just want to annoy me again ? " This person was in good spirits , which was a bad sign . Ordinarily , she merely nagged me to get a job and called me a worthless , good-for-nothing dope . But when she became nice  --  well , frankly , this person was not above using all the sly artifice of a woman 's wiles to get her way , and upon two occasions she had lured me into predicaments from which I had extricated myself only with the greatest embarrassment . Indeed , upon the second occasion it was only with the utmost ingenuity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , handing me a large Manila envelope . " I 'm glad you 're through kidding yourself , Horace . You ca n't write for sour apples . " " Editors never read unsolicited manuscripts , " I told her . " I opened it , " she said . " It stinks . " " That 's a federal offense . " " Practically use of the mails in an attempt to defraud . What corn ! And I never in my life heard people talk like that . " " You have never lived in high society . " " Have you ? " I did not wish to quarrel with this person , for , after all , she served a purpose in bringing groceries and the mail , saving me the six-mile hike to town . " Did the dictionary come ? " " What use will you have for a dictionary ? " She began unloading cartons from the pickup . From these cartons came the sound of cheeping . " What are you doing ? " " Your baby chicks came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks . Where 's your coop ? " " Wait a minute . I do n't want any baby chicks . " " I 'll help you get them started . One thing about you , Horace , when you decide on a thing , you do it in a big way . Where 's the coop ? " " Look . I have n't got any coop . I do n't want any chicks . " She put fists on hips . " Horace L. Beck , do you mean to tell me you have n't got things fixed ready ? In there asleep on your lazy back , and 1,000 baby chicks coming ! " She sighed . " Maybe dad 's right . Maybe you 're not worth the powder and lead . Maybe Crummy Jacobs has got you taped . " I did not wish to go into the subject of Crummy Jacobs , who had been in my outfit overseas and had spread the story that I had decided to be a writer because there was a mere Pfc in the company who was a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought I would be a better one . Crummy also claimed that I got my Purple Heart from tripping over a bucket while running to a shelter during an air raid . Anyone interested may refer to the official records , which show that my war injury , a broken ankle , was sustained in enemy action . The injury makes it impossible to pursue my former profession of night-club hoofer , and I receive a small pension , which allows me to devote full time to literary composition . I examined the labels on the cartons . The chicks unquestionably were addressed to me , and had beenshipped by your company . " There has been a snafu , " I said , and began putting the cartons onto the truck . " You can send them right back . " " Well , I never , " the person said , and began putting the crates onto the ground again . " I 'm ashamed of you . A decent impulse for once in your lazy life , and now you 're trying to back out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't order any biddies . " " You mean , really ? " " I mean really . I ordered a dictionary . What would I do with baby chicks ? " The person began to laugh . " This is the funniest thing I ever heard in my life ! A thousand baby chicks by mistake ! " I laughed . " Crazy , is n't it ? Well , we 'll send them back . " " Oh , but you ca n't . " " Why ca n't I ? " " Chicks do n't need feed for a couple of days , but after that they 've got to have constant care . You would n't want these poor little innocent things to die . Oh , Horace , " she said , peeking through the holes of a carton , " are n't they the cutest little darlings ? " " I have n't got a place to put them . And I do n't know the first thing about biddies . " " Oh , 1 forgot . " She got a booklet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free instructions . " " I wonder who got my dictionary ? " " Horace , this may be the making of you . I have a theory about mail-order houses . " " So have I , " I said bitterly . " Historians have ignored an important factor in the development of American independence , initiative , and inventive genius . What might this country have become without mail order ? A farmer selects a mowing machine from the catalogue . A couple of weeks later some gunnysacks full of odd parts are tossed off at his mailbox . With nothing but a rusty monkey wrench and a hammer he assembles them . Perhaps by mistake he has received a thresher , a concrete mixer , a tractor , or a windmill . Nothing daunted , he converts it into a mowing machine with a little baling wire and scrap iron , and has enough parts left over for a wheelbarrow . That 's something you could do as a writer , Horace  --  tell the real story of what made America great . Though I guess you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't your dad use these chicks ? " " Oh , dad 's got his this year . Everybody has . You 're late . But better late than never . " She got in and drove away , leaving me with 1,000 cheeping biddies . Well , sirs , I did my best to protect your merchandise . I sat down to read the book of instructions . Presently I was wondering why my stories bounced back when such writing as that got into print . For example , the book said : " Chicks should be fed four times daily . " At what times , it did not say . How was Ito know if they took a second breakfast , afternoon tea , or a midnight snack for that extra meal ? " It is very important not to allow young chicks to overeat . " How , may I ask you , do you know when a chick has had a square meal , but should n't make a pig of itself ? I can imagine nothing more futile than asking a chick when it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mash . " Which seems plain enough  --  smash up the grain  --  until the next line : " The mash is fed alternately between the scratch grain the first week or two , and then placed in self-feeding hoppers . " What writing ! Mash apparently was something similar to what corn whiskey is made out of . But was scratch grain a food or a utensil similar to a self-feeding hopper ? Or was a self-feeding hopper a type of insect similar to a grasshopper which ate the mash and then leaped into the mouths of the chicks ? And where did the book get that " first week or two " stuff ? At that age , you 're dealing with half a chick 's lifetime . " Milk should be supplied if possible . The particular form of the milk does not matter . " How many forms has milk got ? It is whatever shape the utensil is that you pour it into . Certainly the book could not mean it did n't matter whether you fed chicks fresh milk or powdered . I was overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book was hinting that I might inflict powdered milk on helpless baby chicks , I was through with it . Anyhow , it was full of generalities and obscure technical terms . ironically , its title was Chicken Raising for Beginners . I walked over the hill to the Yost farm for a little practical informa tion . Mr. Yost , incidentally , is the father of the person I have previously introduced . I found the family at dinner  --  the parents , the daughter , and the brat . " Just in time , Horace , " the daughter greeted . " As usual , " the brat said . Instead of beaming at the brat , Mr. Yost told him to shut up and beamed at me . " Ah , Horace , for myself I am glad you have what you call it ' come out of it . ' A thousand baby chicks . Yes , my boy , it is a job you now have for sure got ! " " It was a mistake , " I said . " I ordered a dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very funny . Brooders in shape ? " " Pardon me ? " " Your brooders . They are O.K. working ? " I might mention , sirs , that Mr. Yost 's English was slightly broken , though I will not attempt to put it in dialect , not wishing to confuse you further . " The last I heard , " I said , " my brothers were working . " " Fine , my boy , fine ! But watch them . Do not them smother let . " " / think , Horace , " the daughter said , " you need some help . " " I think you are right , " I said . " But I want it on a business basis . The mail-order company will pay for protection of its merchandise . " During the meal Mr. Yost kept talking about raising chickens . I kept telling him it was all a mistake . To no avail . He was convinced I had turned over a new leaf . Later , when my helper and I were going over the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had such difficulty understanding the language . " " Dad 's proud of you . He likes your attitude  --  that it was all a mistake . Admirable modesty . He hates people who blow their own horns , like you used to about being a writer . " " I do n't care what he thinks . It was a mistake . " " Or are you turning over a new leaf ? " Which illustrates the attitude of everybody during the next few weeks . People suddenly became friendly , much to my annoyance . I wanted nothing to do with the local yokels . All I wanted was privacy and seclusion to pursue my literary career . I hope it will not be necessary to detail the steps necessary to protect your merchandise . That , like childbirth and the day of induction into the Army , is best forgotten . Suffice that with no equipment , we housed the chicks the first night in my cabin . My helper left at midnight , and I got no sleep at all . The next day while my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for a list of things and sent you a wire concerning the crisis . You can imagine my consternation when , two weeks later , I received a mimeographed postcard asking me to return all papers , so you could adjust the matter . I did that . You then sent the dictionary and told me to return the other merchandise . I wrote concerning the practical problems , and today I received a duplicate of the first postcard . My point , sirs , is that you have the papers . And I still have the chicks . I trust this explains everything , and please advise immediately . Yours sincerely , HORACE L. BECK , RED BLUFF , CALIF .

( Form GL16A-20M ) MAMMOTH MAIL ORDER CO. , Los ANGELES , CALIF . June 29 DEAR SIRS : 1 want to explain everything . There has been a horrible mistake . As 1 intimated in a previous letter , my helper has been entirely too nice of late . I should have known . Last week as I was toting a sack of feed from the pickup , my helper left the door of the coop open . In a case like that , time is of the essence . I did n't even have time to put the sack down . When the chickens were rounded up , I noticed a car had arrived and a man was watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " No , " he said , " I 'm from the Veterans Administration . Quite a demonstration for a man with a permanently injured ankle . " And so now , sirs , it appears I must work for a living . On top of that blow , the following day I drove to town for some grit , and blew out a tire that had been thin for some time . In getting the jack I found an envelope addressed to me , and from your company . It had been opened , then stuffed between the seat and back cushion , to fail into view when I removed the seat to get the jack . This envelope contained the papers and original order that you always mail back to a customer at the time you ship the merchandise . These papers showed that on March seventh I had ordered one thousand ( 1,000 ) baby chicks . The order was in my name , but the handwriting was that of my helper . When I returned , my helper was feeding the chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her duplicity . " Oh , you found it , " she said calmly . " I knew you would . That tire must have given out . It was overdue . " It was I , rather than she , who was nonplused . " Just another of your underhanded tricks to put me to work . You 've tried before . " " Yes , " she admitted happily . " And , oh , Horace , you 've proved it . You are worth the powder and lead . " " I ordered a dictionary . You sent another order in my name for 1,000 baby chicks . Then you intercepted the dictionary and the papers concerning the baby chicks . " " Maybe you 'd better lie down , " she said . " You 're all red in the face . " " For a corn-fed yokel , you could give lessons to -- Just why , " I yelled , " do you have to taunt me with it ? You could have kept it from me ! You did n't have to shatter my illusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spark of decency in you . " " 1 wanted you to find out . I 'm not one to live a deception , like some I could mention . " And she kicked me on the ankle . " Ouch , " I said . " I would n't be a bit surprised if you arranged that demonstration for the Veterans Administration man . " " It is a citizen 's duty to protect the taxpayers ' money . Though I did n't expect you to have a 100-pound sack of feed on your back . That was just luck . " " Where 's that dictionary I ordered in the first place ? " " Oh , it 's home . I 'm saving it for you . I thought maybe next winter when you have some spare time -- - " " Beat it , " I said , " before I haul off and sock a woman . " " Oh , now Horace . Do n't you see ? I was only proving that you were worth the powder and lead . You rose to the emergency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here ! " I yelled . " And take your chickens with you ! " " They are not my chickens . " " They are your chickens . " " They arrived in your name . You accepted them . You raised them . Anyhow , what do you want to do . starve to death ? " I turned and rushed into the cabin . I did n't want to run amok . I was packing up when she asked from a window , " What are you doing ? " " I 'm a night-club hoofer . Why came out here I do n't know . " " What about your chickens ? " " To hell with the chickens . " " What about your place ? " " To hell with the place . " " What about me ? " " To hell with you . " I continued packing . She came in and began fussing around the stove . " It 's not that simple , Horace . You continued on following page owe me for the price of 1,000 baby chicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hired me as a helper on a business basis . I have witnesses . You owe me wages from back in March . You owe for the use of the pickup . You blew out a perfectly good tire . Do n't think you 'll just skip your bills , either . People up here wo n't stand for it , a night-club hoofer doing that to a girl . " " Why do n't you get out of here ? " I yelled . " I 'm fixing a little something to eat . You 'll need energy to think over your problem . " " For the last time , get out of here ! I would n't eat another bite of what you cook ! It might be poisoned ! Now , scram . " " Well , all right . " She went out and drove away . 1 sat down to face my doom . There was no way out . She had whipsawed me . I was confronted by a life of grim toil getting out of her debt . To hell with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. Beck would become just a nameless bum on skid row , on account of a woman . I decided 1 needed some nourishment for the six-mile hike to town . But l could n't find the salt . My helper had been attending to the cooking , and she had a woman 's devilish habit of tucking things away . I walked over the hill . The Yosts were at the table . " Just in time , Horace , " my helper said brightly . " As usual , " the brat said . " All I wanted to know , " I said : " where did you put the salt ? " " Oh , " my helper said , producing the shaker from a pocket of her slacks , " I must have carried it off . " " You knew I 'd come for it . " I said . " Why do you do things like this ? " She said , " Do n't you know ? " There was something about the way she said it . Her eyes big and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bunny , she loved me . Me , a night-club hoofer ! The crazy little kid . I had n't so much as laid a finger on her . I was n't the one to fool around with the corn-fed type . Then I saw her parents beaming proudly , and I was conscious of my overalls and work-hardened hands , and I wondered what had happened to the night-club hoofer . I remembered how empty the cabin had been after my helper had left , and what wonderful food she cooked , and how pleasant it was even to work when she was around . And I really had n't tried to find that salt . I 'd kept looking in places I knew it would n't be . And there was one way to get out of her debt . " Yes , " I said , " I guess I do . " " Adeline , " her father said as she arose , " you have not your supper finished . " " Papa , " her mother said , " she does not the supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lovey dovey gooey ! " And without going into further detail , sirs , here is the situation : I am now in the chicken business . 1 have on hand three dictionaries , Unabridged , India Paper Edition , No. 339B188GL , $32.50 , postpaid . Two of them belong to you . The third , which I ordered in the first place , will come in handy . My wife says that in our spare time next winter we can write the story of how the mail-order business fostered American initiative , independence , and inventive genius . The real story of what made America great . 1 would appreciate any data on the subject you might be kind enough to forward . Yours happily , HORACE L. BECK , RED BLUFF , CALIF .
