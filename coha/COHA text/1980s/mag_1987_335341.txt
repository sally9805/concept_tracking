Those ever inventive Japanese automakers have come up with another innovation on their cars : back wheels that turn right and left , just like front wheels . Four-wheel steering , or 4WS , first appeared in Japan two years ago on Nissan 's high-performance Skyline autos . Now an advanced version of 4WS is being offered to Japanese car buyers , by Honda on its latest Prelude two-door and by Mazda on its luxury Capella . <P> With 4WS , all four wheels of the auto move with the turn of the steering wheel . The arc of the rear wheels , though , is never more than 5 degrees , vs. 30 degrees for the front wheels . That is enough to improve maneuverability at low speeds . At high speeds , 4WS markedly reduces the risk of skidding when a driver changes lanes , for example . <P> Nissan charges about $350 for 4WS in Japan , while Mazda demands a daunting $1,000 . Mazda intends to export its 4WS Capella to the U.S. and Europe next year .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
