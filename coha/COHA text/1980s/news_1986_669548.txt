Mr. Peres ' one-week visit to the United States and Canada was originally expected to be little more than a farewell tour for the prime minister , who is to hand over the premiership to Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir on Oct. 14 . But the summit meeting held last week between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Peres injected new meaning into Peres ' one-day Washington visit. // Officials close to Peres said the prime minister will discuss in detail the results of the summit with President Reagan , Secretary of State George Shultz , and other senior administration officials . The prime minister is expected to advocate Israel ' s views on how the Reagan administration should capitalize on the Peres-Mubarak talks , the first such meeting between Egyptian and Israeli heads of state in five years. // // ' ' We would like to urge another round of Middle East shuttling by ( Assistant US Secretary of State Richard ) Murphy , ' ' one Peres aide said. // Israel Radio announced over the weekend that Israel ' s ambassador to the US met with the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Peres and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze . Peres is to stop in New York later this week , where Mr. Shevardnadze will be visiting the UN . One sticking point for holding an international peace conference is Israel ' s insistence that the Soviet Union can only participate if it restores diplomtic ties with Israel , which it severed during the 1967 war . Observers here speculated that Peres will explore the Soviet views on holding a conference , and the possibility of improved Soviet-Israeli relations. // Peres appears eager to convince the Reagan administration that although he will soon switch to the role of foreign minister , he still will actively pursue peace talks with Israel ' s Arab neighbors . As the scheduled rotation of posts grows closer , Peres has taken pains to tell interviewers that he sees Israel ' s pursuit of negotiations as a requirement for his Labor Party ' s continued participation in Israel ' s ' ' national unity ' ' government. // If Peres is able to turn his summit meeting with President Mubarak into the first step toward an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse of the government and new elections , because the Likud remains adamantly opposed to an international peace conference and to any negotiations that might lead to Israeli territorial concessions. // But the chances of creating a peace issue attractive enough to face the Israeli electorate with hinge on Israel ' s ability to offer something that will bring Jordan and the Palestinians to a negotiating table . Avraham Tamir , director-general of the prime minister ' s office , told reporters after the two-day summit ended Friday that he was disappointed it had produced no firm commitment to further talks , and no breakthroughs that would entice Jordan ' s King Hussein. // During his 26-hour stay in Alexandria , Egypt , the prime minister certainly pushed against the limits imposed on him by the nature of his coalition government with the hard-line Likud half of his Cabinet .

Likud Knesset ( parliament ) member Dan Meridor , who accompanied Peres to the summit , said that the Egyptians tried to persude the Israelis to endorse the formula of Palestinian self-determination within the context of a confederation with Jordan . Peres refused to accept the formula. // But the Egyptians said after the summit that they generally were pleased with its results. // ' ' It ' s a good appetizer , ' ' said Tahsin Bashir , a retired Egyptian diplomat who remains closely ties to the Mubarak administration . ' ' It ' s a new start . But whether you build something real , that ' s a different matter.

Publicly , Egypt insists that the Palestine Liberation Organization represent the Palestinians . Israel still maintains it will not deal with the PLO , which it brands a terrorist organization. // Observers noted that in his comments following the issuing of the joint communique , Mubarak made no mention of the PLO , nor even any mention of the differences between Israel and Egypt over who should represent the Palestinians in peace negotiations . Instead , the President said that Israel and Egypt ' ' are going to keep in touch . . . so as to help the comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian issue. // ' ' Of course , ' ' Mubarak continued , ' ' we will cooperate with our friend , His Majesty King Hussein , beause he is playing a very important role in the Palestinian problem .
