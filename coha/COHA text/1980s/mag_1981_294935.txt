THE MAGAZINE MAZE <P> by Herbert R. Mayes <P> Doubleday ; 378 pages ; $14.95 <P> Novelist John Marquand called him the third best editor he had ever known , after George Horace Lorimer and Maxwell Perkins . William Faulkner , Rebecca West , Willa Cather and other major writers found him a staunch and generous companion . Marc Connelly and William Saroyan phoned him when they needed money . One of the few dissenters was Evelyn Waugh , who called him , with characteristic bile , " an emaciated Jew lately promoted within the Hearst organization from editing a weekly paper devoted to commercial chemistry . " <P> Waugh was miles off the mark . Even at 80 , Herbert Mayes is still lithe , but he has never been emaciated , anatomically or creatively . And though he once edited Hearst 's monthly American Druggist , he was , when Waugh wrote for him in the 1940s , one of the nation 's most eminent magazine editors . By the time he retired in 1969 , Mayes had guided the old Pictorial Review , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCall 's . <P> None of this made him a celebrity . As he notes in this wry saga , it was his publications and authors who became household names . Those authors live again in a series of anecdotes . John O'Hara , who once threatened to " break every bone in your body " after Mayes refused to send him $25,000 forthwith for the right merely to read the manuscript of Ten North Frederick for possible excerpting . Eleanor Roosevelt , a onetime McCall 's contributor , who offered him a ride home one night , though she did not have a car . " Let 's both go out and stand on the curb , " she advised , " and pretty soon somebody will come along in a car and recognize me and offer us a lift . " ( She was right . ) <P> When writers paused for breath , Mayes would start talking . By the time he had finished , their names were often affixed to contracts . F. Scott Fitzgerald was one of his authors ; so were Sinclair Lewis , Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wouk , Agatha Christie , Art Linkletter , Clare Boothe Luce , Ogden Nash , Hubert Humphrey , Jacqueline Kennedy , Lucille Ball and Maurice Chevalier , and most of them are worth a story or two . Mayes treated them with amused kindness , helped them through personal crises and paid them well , even for that golden age of magazines : $10,000 per short story for Somerset Maugham ; a Ford station wagon shipped to Dublin for Waugh . Today Mayes rails against magazines for being parsimonious and tells his younger colleagues : " Publishing would be nothing but another business if it were n't for the editors who give it some semblance of a profession .
