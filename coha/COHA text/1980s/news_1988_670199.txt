NEW YORK  --  Shell-shocked by last year ' s market crash and burned by deals they ' ve bought in the past , investors are forcing the Wall Street whiz kids who invent new securities to learn a new virtue  --  simplicity . During the past few years , the appearance of new and exotic types of securities has signaled spring almost as reliably as the first crocuses . But this spring might be different , say some investment bankers . " We never create in a vacuum , " says Thomas K. McCaughey , a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc . " We have to see a need on the part of investors . " And investors are lying low . Innovations like warrants to buy foreign currencies  --  so hot last summer that buyers snapped up $100 million of issues from 10 companies in about six weeks  --  hardly even trade any more . Last week , by contrast , investors bought more than $2 billion of plain , ordinary corporate debt and preferred stock . " There ' s volatility , uncertainty and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marks , head of fixed-income investing at Cigna Investments Inc. , a Cigna Corp. subsidiary . " We are taking a much more cautious  --  and constructive , we hope  --  approach to the public markets . " Many recent innovations have given buyers an explicit bet on future moves in interest or currency rates . That ' s a hard sell when investors aren ' t in a betting mood . " I can create things for bulls and for bears , and even for uncertain investors , " says one new-products official  --  " but not this uncertain . " " There ' s got to be a sense of a strong trend " to make fancy gimmicks attractive , says Michael S. Rulle , head of the financing department at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc . " Right now it ' s kind of trendless . " Even some investment bankers , however , acknowledge that there ' s another factor behind investors ' increasing caution . A lot of the fancy deals of previous springs haven ' t turned out as well as investors expected . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standard instrument like a bond with some sort of currency or interest-rate option , and tied the whole thing into a neat , convenient package . But investors sometimes paid a high price for that convenience . For instance , a big hit of the past couple of years has been bonds issued by U.S. companies that pay interest and principal in Australian or New Zealand dollars . The bonds paid a high interest rate , though the issuers , through a complicated set of hedges , ended up with a below-market cost of funds and no foreign-currency exposure . For investors , though , they weren ' t a success . Not only did they bet wrong ; they paid too much for the privilege , says one investor . " It looked great , " says Kenneth Windheim , director of international fixed-income investing at Prudential Capital Management International , a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America . " You could buy a 17% Eastman Kodak Co . New Zealand-dollar bond when Treasuries were yielding 6. 25% . " But , Mr. Windheim adds , that 17% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Zealand government was paying . That ' s as foolish as buying traditional corporate bonds that pay two points under U.S. Treasuries , he argues . A portfolio manager " would have his head handed to him " for such a purchase . Many other exotic securities give investors a lower yield than they could get by duplicating the transaction themselves  --  buying , for instance , a corporate bond and a forward contract to sell Japanese yen , instead of a bond with a return tied to the yen ' s value . Even when the issue is attractively priced , exotic securities run into another problem . They ' re a lot easier to buy than to sell . Prudential ' s Mr. Windheim says he learned that the hard way , after buying an attractively priced floating-rate note that was issued in dollars but convertible into European currency units , which are based on a basket of European currencies . " If the dollar weakened , it was a great deal , " he recalls . The dollar did weaken . But when Mr. Windheim tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salomon and Goldman Sachs &; Co.  --  willing to bid on the note . Goldman offered $980 for a note that had cost $1 , 000 and was worth $1 , 080 to $1 , 100 , Mr. Windheim says . Salomon , which had sold Prudential the note , bid $1 , 060 . While he was glad to get some profit , even Salomon ' s price " didn ' t reflect the value , " he adds . Salomon later persuaded the issuer to redeem the notes , and bought the rest of its investors out at a higher premium . Since then , Mr. Windheim has made his own bets directly , rather than relying on underwriters ' packaged securities . " There are better ways to try to enhance your performance than buying garbage , " he says sourly . Investment bankers note that many of the buyers of packaged securities would have a hard time imitating Prudential . Foreign-currency bonds , for instance , were bought largely by retail investors who might have a hard time buying New Zealand government securities . Thrift institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were big buyers of securities whose return was linked to the performance of a foreign currency . Even those investors , however , are learning to look at alternatives before buying . " Investors certainly understand reverse engineering , " says Robert G. Scott , head of the debt-syndicate department at Morgan Stanley &; Co . New ideas won ' t go away , Mr. Scott argues ; but , he concedes , " We ' ll find it tougher to satisfy our well-developed sense of greed .
