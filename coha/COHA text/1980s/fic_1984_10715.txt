crouched to help his foster-brother finish arranging the pleats of a great kilt on the floor , unable to disagree . " That 's true , in theory , " he said , watching Dhugal lie down on the kilt to belt it around his narrow waist . " Thank God his father comes first  --  and I 've never heard anyone say an unkind word about Nigel . Perhaps by the end of next year there will be a new heir altogether . Still , you 're right about youth being no excuse for rude behavior . Conan can be a terrible boor . " Dhugal , sitting up to brooch part of the plaid to his shoulder with an amethyst the size of plover 's egg , looked up from the gem 's clasp with a start to stare at the king . " Bugger Conall ! What do you mean , a new heir ? Kelson , you are n't betrothed , are you ? " " No , no , not that , yet , " Kelson replied with a chuckle . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a king . It 's expected . Nigel and Aunt Meraude have been badgering me for over a year , and Morgan nearly as long . " " Morgan , too ? " Kelson shrugged wistfully . " Well , all of them are right , of course . The succession has to be secured . I 've lost count of the princesses and countessesand other eligible girls I 've had to inspect in the last year . Every lordling in Gwynedd with a marriageable daughter or sister between the ages of twelve and thirty has been finding some excuse to bring her to court . Even Morgan is threatening to trot out some R'Kassan princess for Twelfth Night . She 's a relative of his wife . " " His wife ? " Dhugal stared even harder , though now he , too , was grinning . " So that 's what it 's all about ! Morgan 's gotten married , so now he thinks everyone else ought to be . Who 's the lady ? " Kelson shook his head and grinned . He kept forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are out of touch , are n't you ? You did know I 'd made him Lord Protector of the South , did n't you ? " " No . " " Did you know that Torenth has a regency again ? " Kelson ventured . " A regency ? What happened to Prince Alroy ? " Kelson sighed , trying to keep at least some of the old worry out of his voice . " A fall from a horse , around Midsummer . He broke his neck . From what I 've been able to gather , it was clearly an accident , but he 'd just come of age . So some folk are saying I arranged it  --  the way Charissa arranged my father 's death . "  | " You mean , with magic ? " Dhugal whispered . Kelson nodded . " They do n't know me very well , do they ? " " But , what possible motive could you have , even if you were able to  --  are you able to kill someone with magic , Kelson ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to kill someone with magic , the answer is yes  --  I have the power and the knowledge to do so , " Kelson said quietly . " I've -- had to do it once already . I killed Alroy 's father and uncle that way  --  and the Earl of Marley . I 'm not proud of it , but there was no other way at the time . And I 'd do it again to protect my king-dom . " He swallowed uncomfortably . " As for motive , I 'm afraid I have that , too . Keeping a minor on the throne of Torenth lessens the chance that Torenth will move against me in anything but border skirmishes , at least until the new king is of age . Liam , Alroy 's next brother , is only nine . That gives me nearly five years to get things settled in Meara , before I have to worry seriously about Torenth again  --  maybe more . I did n't kill Liam 's brother , though . " " I believe you , " Dhugal said . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelson knew that they were true . Four years had passed since he and Dhugal last had met , but he could sense that the old closeness had not weakened with the passage of the years and all that had gone on during them . He glanced down at his hands , the hands which literally held the power of life and death over so many , then shook his head , knowing he would never be able to put aside the knowledge of his power . " But , enough of all this , " Kelson continued more brightly . " You asked about Morgan , and Morgan 's wife . He married Richenda of Marley a year ago last spring . They have a little daughter who 's nearly a year old now . Briony , she 's called . " " For your father , " Dhugal murmured , nodding approvingly . " I like that . But Richenda of Marley  --  was n't she the Countess of Marley ? Did n't you just say you 'd had to kill her husband ? " " Yes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said softly . " Nor was their son . I confirmed young Brendan in the Earldom of Marley when he turned six this past summer . I 've made him Morgan 's ward , until he 's of age , and Richenda his regent . " " And what will he say when he 's older , and he learns who killed his father ? " Dhugal whispered . " Suppose he comes to hate you for it ? " " I suppose I hope that by then , he 'll have learned why I had to do it , " Kelson said with a sigh . " Bran Coris ' was one of the first lives I had to take . Unfortunately , it wo n't be the last . At least I 've learned a few thingsp52since then  --  not that they 'd make any difference if I had to do over again . " He sighed again , a gesture of finality . " But that 's done . There 's no sense brooding about something I ca n't change . One thing I hope I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here an hour ago . " Dhugal laughed aloud , the solemnity of the past few minutes dispelled . " Now , that will be magic , if you can accomplish that . You saw them , Kelson . They 're bordermen . Most of them have never been to court , and never will . You ca n't expect to earn their respect overnight . " " Not overnight , no . But I do have an idea for making a start , per-haps . " Half an hour later , two young bordermen emerged from the tower room where only one had entered . Dhugal 's comment about his long hair the day before had given Kelson his inspiration . He had decided not to hazard a great kilt such as Dhugal himself wore , for he was disinclined to trust a garment which depended on only a belt to discipline so many pleats , so he had chosen a set of Dhugal 's rust-colored border leathers instead  --  close-fitting trews and sleeveless doublet over a saffron wool shirt like Dhugal 's . A length of grey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest baldric style and secured at the left shoulder with a deeply chased silver ring brooch , and soft indoor boots of buckskinencased his feet in comfort . Instead of the golden circlet which would have adorned his head at any normal court function , he wore a border bonnet like Dhugal 's . His black hair made a borderman 's braid shorter by a handspan than Dhugal 's copper one , but that , plus the clothing , transformed the king from a polished young lowland noble into a darker echo of the chief 's son . Now , if only old Caulay would play along . He began to hear the skirl of pipers tuning as he followed Dhugal down the newel stair and along the passage toward the castle 's great hall  --  dissonant and whining at first , but then catching and carrying a traditionalborder air , one of the few he knew . The music put a new spring in his step as he and Dhugal emerged near the entrance to the hall , and he could hear Dhugal whistling softly under his breath . Border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milled in the anteroom outside the open doors to the hall , but in Dhugal 's company , dressed as he was , no one paid Kelson any particular notice . Seizing a torch from a fire-blackened cresset , Dhugal led him through the press and quickly through a nondescript wooden door just beyond the entryway , signing for silence as he continued up a steep , narrow intramural passageway which paralleled the great hall . When Kelson judged them to be about halfway along its length , Dhugal stopped and uncovered twop53narrow squints cut at different angles in the stone , carefully holding his torch below and close to the wall to shield its light . Using each squint in turn , Kelson could see nearly all the length of the hall below , though the entrance and the dais at the other end were out of range . " It looks like most of your men who are n't on duty are already seated , " Dhugal murmured , gazing downward with Kelson . " You can see how they 've all kept to themselves , though . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kelson nodded as he studied the hall . Since , by border custom , all clansmen were more or less of equal rank , there were no separate arrangements for nobles and men-at-arms . He saw Duke Ewan moving down the hall with a surly-looking Conall  --  to be seated at the high table , Dhugal assured him  --  but other than them , almost all the rest of the royal entourage seemed to be crowded on either side of a long table paralleling one side wall  --  carefully isolated , Kelson noted , from the rest of the clansmen and their women . Hospitality , it seemed , had its limits . He was thoughtful as he followed Dhugal farther along the passageway and around a bend , the pipers ' jig hardly intruding at all now on his thinking as he gazed through another squint looking toward the high table . From there , he was able to survey everyone on the dais , including the Earl of Transha . Caulay MacArdry had aged in the three years since Kelson last had seen him , but though time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility , it clearly had not touched his other faculties . A gillie had to help him into his chair at the high table , for he could no longer walk without assistance , but the arms emerging from his fine saffron shirt were still corded with muscle , tanned nut-brown from the high summer sun and wind of the Transha highlands . Kelson could see the muscles ripple as the old man hefted a full wineskin and drank unerringly from a stream of red without spilling a drop . His wiry grey hair was drawn back in a borderer 's clout and bound with a ribbon woven in the colors of his clan , but the full beard flowing onto his chest still showed a little of the chestnut gleam of his youth . The brown eyes were clear and alert as he conversed with Duke Ewan , seated on the other side of Conall , at his left hand ; but he kept glancing at the far end of the hall as if in expectation . " Is he looking for us ? " Kelson asked softly , glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in ? " " Yes , but not in the way you 're thinking , " Dhugal replied . He grinned slyly as he seized a fold of Kelson 's sleeve and drew him back into the passage . " Let 's go . Just follow my lead , and do what I do . "  |p54Soon  they were emerging behind the screens which separated the kitchen from the dais in the great hall , Dhugal nudging the king through one of the bays to move with him among the gillies serving the high table . The men deferred to their chief 's son , but they hardly gave Kelson a second look other than to avoid running into him as he stuck to Dhugal 's side . They were too busy watching Conall , seated on the chief 's left , and Jodrell , who had pulled up a stool at the end of the table to sit and speak to Ewan between them . The old Duke of Claibourne had been readily accepted among them , for he came of the same clan system as themselves and understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knights and men-at-arms seated in the hall below . Conall , defiantly aloof in court dress and the silver circlet of his rank , looked particularly out of place . But Kelson sensed Dhugal 's intentions now . As the younger boy worked his way closer to the high table , gesturing toward the place of honor at old Caulay 's right and easing onto the bench to the right of that , Kelson controlled a smile . and followed . With casual nonchalance , he slipped into the place between Dhugal and the old man and leaned an elbow on the table , merely raising an eyebrow at a gillie who ducked between him and Dhugal to pour wine for both of them and started to question . Some of his own men began to recognize him at that , however , and as more and more of them got to their feet with much clatter and scraping of wooden benches against stone floor , the commotion caught old Caulay'sattention . As he turned to ascertain the reason for it , he was astonished to see a strange young borderman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheezed to a halt as all eyes turned toward the MacArdry chief . " The Haldane gives fair greeting to The MacArdry of Transha , " Kelsonsaid gravely , inclining his head in respect as Caulay 's jaw dropped . " My brother Dhugal bade me sit at your right hand , sir , and I am right honored to do so , for his father must be my father , since I have none anymore . " Stunned speechless , Caulay stared into the grey Haldane eyes as the buzz of questions grew among his people , seeing the strange mixed with the familiar . The last Haldane old Caulay had seen had been a boy of just fourteen , on the occasion of his coronation . The lad before him was young , but he was a man , with the frank , direct gaze of his other border chieftains . As he glanced beyond the stranger at his son , Dhugal rose and came to kiss his father 's cheek with a grin . " I 've brought m'brother home tae sup with us , Da , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count it a great favor if ye could put his other rank aside for a night , for he would do honor to our house an ' blood for sake o ' the bond he shares wi ' me . Will ye nae greet him as a kinsman an ' a son ? " For an interminable instant , Kelson feared that Caulay would not go along , that the close-knit bonds of border kinship would force him back into the royal role he was so often obliged to play . But then the old man 's face split in a pleased grin and he held out a huge hand to Kelson , the brown eyes warming . " Aye , and it 's pleased that I am to see ye , son , " he said softly . " I left ye a boy , and ye 've come back a man . Will ye nae give yer old Da the kiss of peace ? " Solemnly Kelson placed his hand in Caulay 's and rose , inclining his head in proper salute , borderer to hosting chief , acutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss the old man 's cheek , however , a ragged murmur of approval rippled among the bordermen and the pipes struck up a dutiful salute , this time punctuated by drums . It was not the most spontaneous of welcomes , but it was a start . Pretendingnot to notice Conall 's sour looks farther down the table , and the confused expressions on most of the rest of his retinue , Kelson took his seat , smiling . Brion would never have done this , but Kelson was not Brion . They would just have to adjust to the fact that he was going to develop his own style . He laughed at a joke Dhugal murmured in an aside , and when Ciard came to serve them roast fowl and beef on a trencher of hearty highland bread , he dug in with his fingers in proper border fashion . He and Caulay made casual small talk through the meal , Kelson touching on some of his experiences of the past three years and the old chief proudly recounting Dhugal 's skill as a future border chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . Out of respect for his host , Kelson veered away from politics or any other subjects of possible controversy , intending to save such conversationfor more private surrounds , perhaps later that night . But just before the sweet was served  --  a sticky confection of crushed almonds and biscuit and honey  --  Caulay made passing reference to his brother Sicard , whose wife was the Mearan Pretender . " What 's she like , the Lady Caitrin ? " Kelson asked , trying to keep toomuch interest out of his tone . To his relief , Caulay was neither offendednor reticent , wine having loosened his tongue to the point of amiability . " Ach , she nurses an old dream whose time passed tang ago , " Caulaysaid . " I did nae ever like her . She 's of an age wi ' me  --  no spring hen/chick , she  --  but she has fierce bairns an'a fiercer mate . She an ' my brother  --  ! " He spat contemptuously , and Kelson raised an eyebrow in feigned surprise . " You and Sicard had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the old man allowed . " Truth is , he an ' I were never close . I 'm nae close to the bairns , either  --  leastways not the boys . Ithel an ' Llewell , they 're named  --  though I expect ye know that . About your age , they are  --  mayhap a year or so younger . The girl , though  --  " " Not another daughter , " Kelson breathed , almost to himself . Old Caulay immediately caught his drift , however , and laughed uproariouslyas he clapped Kelson on the shoulder . " Ach , I see they 've been pushing ye to choose a mate , have n't they , lad ? Well , a man could do far worse than sweet Sidana . Her name means silk ' in the old tongue , an ' she has all the grace the boys an ' their mother lack . Pretty she is , as well as heiress to a great name , wi ' fine sleek hair that reaches to her knees  --  brown as a chestnut burr it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth , too , an ' hips tae bear a man many fine sons , though she can nae be more than fifteen . " " You sound as if you 're trying to marry her off , " Kelson said with a smile . " Are you trying to tell me something ? " Caulay 's shoulders lifted with a coy shrug , even though he was shaking his . head no . " Weel , ' t is not I who 'd presume tae barter a bride for my king , son , " the old man said . " But if a man wanted tae resolve an old , old rift an ' bring peace tae his people , he could do far worse than marryin ' Sidana . If I thought it would help , I 'd marry Dhugal to her  --  or praise God , if I were a younger man , an ' could find a willing priest , I 'd marry her myself , an ' she my own dear niece . " Kelson smiled wanly , remembering what he once read about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two centuries before  --  though there had been a Deryni question in the case of Imre and Ariella , as well . But Caulay 's theoretical solution would certainly have no such repercussions , even if it were to occur . For that matter , he supposed he and Sidana were distantly related  --  his eyes glazed a little as he tried to sort out the generations of cousins through a common great-great-grandfather  --  thoughthey were certainly outside the bounds of consanguinity proscribed by the Church . " I do n't think it will be necessary for you to make the sacrifice , " he reassured Caulay , with a faint , droll grin.  | " Ach , o ' course not . ' T is a Haldane husband she 'd be needin ' , not another borderer , tae muddy matters further . If not Yer Grace , then perhaps yer young cousin , there  --  " The old man glanced down the table where Conall had moved to sit between Ewan and Jodrell , brooding over his wine cup . " Nah , on second reflection , Conall would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She would nae be happy with the likes o ' him  --  though methinks yer young cousin has ambitions o ' his own . Power can be a great temptation , son . But I need nae tell ye about that , do I ? " Surprised , Kelson glanced at Conall and then back at Caulay . " Conall ? " " Ach , I dinnae mean to cast a shadow on yer cousin , lad . But Sidana is a fair marriage prize , an ' could give her husband a fair claim to Meara . With the right persuasion , from the right man , her brothers might even be moved to abandon their claims . " Kelson chuckled grimly and shook his head , running a finger along the rim of his cup . " I 'm trying to avoid that kind of persuasion , Caulay , " he said softly . " I do n't want to have to march into Meara the way my father and grandfatherdid , and solve things with a sword . But I do n't intend to give up what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face clouded and he dropped his gaze to stare into the depths of his goblet . " That may be the only way , son , " he whispered darkly . " Young Ithel wants a throne . He wo n't be content to rule over an exile court in Laas , once his mother is gone . " " You speak as if that might be imminent , " Kelson breathed , gently reaching out to read the truth of Caulay 's words . " Is Ithel plotting some-thing ? " " I dinnae know particulars . I dinnae care to know . " Caulay took a long pull at his wine and shook his head . " It 's only some rumors I 've heard . What young man does not have ambition ? I dinnae care to say more . " Chilled , Kelson nudged his cup aside and stared at Caulay . The old man was telling the truth , as far as he went , but what were the rumors he had heard ? If Ithel of Meara was actively plotting a revolt . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , as he touched his wrist and started trying to Mind-See . " If you know something  --  " " I know nothing ! " Caulay whispered , eyes flashing as he yanked away his wrist . " An ' if ye press me for nothing , then  --  " The skirl of pipes began outside the hall just then , and Caulay broke off and shook his head apologetically , taking another deep draught from hisp58cup . While Kelson searched for a tactful way to reapproach the subject , two pipers marched in from the far end of the hall , preceding a whiterobedold man brandishing two evergreen boughs like bushy swords . Conversation died away as they entered , even the rowdier of the clansmenputting aside their cups to brush caps in salute as the old man passed . The women standing curtseyed , and even the children serving table stopped where they were to render appropriate respect . " Kinkellyan , the chief bard , " Dhugal murmured in his ear , as the old man came between the two pipers and continued toward them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but pay very close atten-tion . " As the man reached the lowest step of the dais and stopped , crossing the boughs over his head in salute as he bowed , the music ended and Dhugal stood , raising a cup in answering salute to the man in white . " Bright moon and starshine on thy path , noble bard . The MacArdry and all his kin welcome Kinkellyan to the hall of Transha . " The old man inclined his head and murmured a phrase Kelson did not quite catch , sweeping the narrow boughs in his hands to either side as if to open an embrace . Kelson thought he had heard his name , but he could not be sure . Dhugal replied with an answering phrase in the border tongue , then bowed and glanced at his father . Old Caulay seemed to have forgotten his previous agitation , and bowed low over his place at table as he , too , raised his cup in salutation . " Kinkellyan offers you his bardic blessing and asks that you be affordedthe enduring friendship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of his mouth . " The MacArdry has accepted on your behalf . Stand up and bow , and then do whatever seems appropriate after Kinkellyan and I have finished . " As Kelson obeyed , Dhugal bowed to his father and left the table , descending the dais to enthusiastic hammerings of fists on tabletops by all his kinsmen . Kelson 's men looked mystified , except for old Ewan . In slow , almost ritual mime , Dhugal took the boughs from the old bard and bowed again , then crossed them in saltire above his head and pivoted slowly on the balls of his feet until he faced Kelson , bending to lay them that way on the floor as the pipers skirled a few introductory bars . The tempo changed as he straightened and set his hands on his hips , rising again on the balls of his feet , and Dhugal began to dance . Kelson felt his own feet stir as he watched , for the pipes seemed to beckon almost magically . For just an instant , as Dhugal moved from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelson 's in a linking so profound that memory surged across the link almost as surely as if Dhu/mirroring Dhugal a little stiffly at first , but then with growing confidence as those in the hall , clansmen and lowland knights alike , looked on in astonishment . As they shifted into the next set of figures , beating out a more emphaticrhythm as they danced within the quarters instead of all around the edges , feet never touching the branches , Kelson could sense that throbbing link again , melding his movements with Dhugal 's . With rare abandon , he let his world shrink down to flying feet and evergreens and Dhugal 's joyous grin . He was only dimly aware when the men and1 women around them started clapping and stamping in time to the music , urging them on , sharing the magic which had nothing to do with being Deryni . Kelson was panting with exhaustion by the time they began the final set of figures , but he did not falter , springing lightly from quarter to quarter , heel and toe , until finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained note , and he and Dhugal were bowing to one anotheron opposite sides of the evergreen cross , hands set on hips . The hall went wild . The clansmen and their women continued to cheer as the two grinning young men half-collapsed against one another , both of them gasping for breath . Other than Ewan , most of Kelson 's other retainers looked stunned , though a few had relaxed enough to join in good-naturedly , not the least of whom was Baron Jodrell . Conall sat sullenly between him and Ewan , his arms folded and lips set in grim disapproval , but at theset as he completed the figure . Kelson caught the very first step of the repeat by letting his feet carry him as they had so many years before , gal , too , had been Deryni and deliberately sent his thought winging into Kelson 's mind  --  the two of them , half a lifetime ago , facing one another over crossed swords , not evergreen boughs , treading out the measures of the dance Dhugal now performed as it was meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhugal had meant  --  do whatever seems appropriate and he found himself edging out from behind the table and down off the dais to where Dhugal spun and leaped . The pipers never faltered as the king came onto the floor . Kelson could sense the expectation of the audience all around , some pleased , some thoroughly mystified , but the old bard looked not at all surprised , though he raised a white eyebrow . Dhugal was just finishing the first set of measuring steps around the ends of the boughs , pivoting and rocking , with first one arm and then the other raised above his head , but when he saw Kelson ease into the quarter which was about to be opposite him , he grinned and gave a nod , setting balled fists on his hips to repeat the firstp60center of the table the MacArdry chief was beaming , his earlier agitation apparently forgotten . As Dhugal and Kelson stumbled up the dais , arm in arm , he held out a newly filled cup in both hands . " Air do slainte ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then Kelson drank deeply from the cup . To your very good health ! The cheering subsided as Dhugal held up an arm for silence , and he was still a little breathless as he turned Kelson to face his people , one arm still around the king 's shoulders . " Kinsmen , this is my foster-brother , Kelson , " he said with a grin . " As you can see , he is a brother of our blood , as well as one of my choosing . That he is also my king is a great joy to me , and I freely give him my allegiance as lord as well as brother and kinsman . Will you honor him the same , for my sake ? " The renewed shouting and cheers were all the confirmation Dhugal needed . As Kelson stood back , pleased , still panting from the exertion of the dance and wondering just how he had managed to bring them around  --  these dour mountain folk who were usually so slow to admit a lowlanderto their midst  --  Dhugal turned and knelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and touching them to his forehead in homage . In ragged succession , Dhugal 's borderers joined him in salute , sinking to one knee in their places . A few even smiled , inasmuch as any borderer did when obliged to follow lowland custom . A handful remained dour and grim , but all of them knelt . The rarity of the concession was not lost on Kelson . " My brother , I thank you , " Kelson said , smoothly raising Dhugal and signalling the rest of them to rise . " And to you , my border kinsman , my profound thanks as well . Please believe that I understand the honor you have done me . And if there be some of you who yet have your doubts about this upstart lowland lord who comes among you , I can not blame you . Nor will I try to change your opinion by my words . My actions , I hope , will speak for me , in that I shall always strive to be your true and gentle lord . " His own men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his hand again for silence . " But though I be lowland born , yet am I a borderer like yourselves , by choice and chosen blood , as my brother Dhugal has said . I would assure you , therefore , that whenever possible , I shall place the considerations of the clan above my own concerns , an ' it be not against the interests of the other folk I have sworn to protect and defend . In token , therefore , I ask that you host me not as king tonight , but as kinsman , and that you joinp61with me in toast to our noble chief : The MacArdry  --  long may he guide his children in peace and plenty . Air do slainte ! " It was the one border phrase Kelson could remember , and he blessed old Caulay for having refreshed his memory earlier , but it produced the desired response . This time there was no restraining the men of Transha . The hall erupted in echo of the traditional border toast , even the most dour of the old chieftains raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck up another dance tune and the floor filled with other dancers eager to tread a few steps with their new young kinsman . Some of the girls were very pretty . Kelson answered their first few invitations with laughing good humor and an honest attempt to follow , but the dance with Dhugal had exhausted both his knowledge and his energy . He soon had to bow himself out and retreat to the safety of his place by the chief . Dhugal remained on the floor . Caulay was jovial company for what remained of the evening , but he downed three cups of wine to every one of Kelson 's and quickly began to show the effects . Any serious return to their discussion was impossible under the circumstances , so they were soon reduced to rambling exchangesabout the dancers , Dhugal 's escapades and prospects for the future , and an increasingly maudlin tendency on Caulay 's part to dwell on his failing health . By the time people began falling asleep at table and bedding down in the hall for the night , Kelson had managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull buzz , but Caulay was on the verge of passing out . Dhugal was less steady on his feet than Kelson , but not really drunk , either . " I think he 's about had enough , do n't you ? " Kelson murmured , when Dhugal returned to the table to refill his cup during a piper 's slowly skirled lament . Dhugal looked down at his father , steadying himself on the edge of the table as he watched old Caulay bobble and grin , then signalled to a gillie who towered at least a head and a half above either him or Kelson . The man scooped up his chief with no more effort than Kelson might have picked up a three year old , and carried him tenderly out of the hall and up the newel stair with the two young men following behind , Dhugal with his arm linked in Kelson 's for stability . When they had gotten the old man to bed and the gillie had gone , Dhugal sank down in a window seat and sighed , glancing up at Kelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left your mark on Transha tonight . The clan will be talking about you all winter  --  and speaking well , too . " Kelson smiled and leaned against the window embrasure , tossing his bonnet to the seat beside Dhugal . The climb to the laird 's chamber hadp62finished clearing his head , and now the considerations of earlier in the evening came flooding back . To have won the confidence of the clan was a fine thing , and part of what he had set out to accomplish , but he still had not learned all he needed to know about Caulay 's Mearan kin . And if Ithel of Meara was plotting .. . " I wonder , will they speak well of me when they remember that I 'm part Deryni ? " he mused , trying to decide how best to approach what he wanted to ask . However he phrased it , Dhugal was going to be either frightened or insulted . Dhugal frowned . " What difference does that make ? And what makes you think of it now ? " " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deryni , " Kelson continued , testing . " You saw that when I put that trooper to sleep so you could sew up his arm . It does have its positive uses . " Dhugal swallowed with an audible sound , suddenly far more sober than he had been , not seconds before , all the gaiety gone . " Why do I have the sudden feeling that something very scary is about to happen . You 're warning me , are n't you ? " " Not  --  exactly . " Kelson glanced down at Dhugal 's upturned face , then over at the sleeping Caulay . " Dhugal , I 've never even been tempted to take unfair advantage of a friendship before , " he said softly , " but damn it  --  he has n't told me everything he knows . " " What do you mean ? " Kelson shook his head . " Oh , I do n't mean to imply a deliberate deception . I think he just does n't want to get involved  --  and one can hardly blame him . Sicard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the father of a boy who may just try to take away my throne  --  and Caulay hinted of conspiracies at dinner , just before he clammed up . " " Surely , you 're not suggesting he 'd keep such knowledge from you , if there really were a danger ? " Dhugal asked . " I do n't know , " Kelson replied . " I do know that your father has information may need  --  and that I have the means to take it , if I must , without his knowledge and without hurting him . " " With magic , " Dhugal supplied . His face had stiffened to a taut mask as Kelson spoke , and now the honey-amber eyes reflected cold resentment , as well as a little fear . " Kelson , I ca n't stop you , " he continued , after a long , slow breath . " If that 's what you 're determined to do , there is n't a thing I can do to prevent it . "  | " I know that . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember it , " Kelson added . " He need never even know I talked with him tonight . " " And if you had to use what you learned against him ? " Dhugal asked . Kelson sighed . " I hope to God it never comes to that , " he murmured , eyes downcast . " You know I would never deliberately do anything to hurt you or your family . But if information that I gained had to be used to stop a war , to save innocent lives  --  well , what would you do ? " Only after a long pause did Dhugal 's answer come : halting , reluctant  --  and resigned . " I suppose I  --  would do what I had to do , " he whispered.  |p64They  have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not.  - -  Hosea 8:4I would do what I had to do . Dhugal 's words put responsibility squarely back on Kelson  --  where it had always rested , with the other burdens of the Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with magic . Kelson found himself wondering whether his father had ever had to make such a demand of a friend . Somehow he could hardly imagine Brion using his powers for much of anything , even though he knew his father had slain the Marluk with magic and obviously had taken the necessary measures to ensure that his legacy passed to Kelson . But Haldane magic was not the same as that derived from being born Deryni  --  and perhaps that difference was the source of some of Kelson 's uneasiness just now , for he had the limitations as well as the benefits of both sorts . The Haldane legacy came full-blown to each successive male heir in the senior royal line , its potential sealed by the previous king and triggered in the heir by ritual whose essential elements apparently had altered little in nearly two hundred years . It was of Deryni origin , to be sure , but it was a somewhat artificial construct , so far as Kelson had been able to learn , crafted by the great Saint Camber for the defense of Cinhil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perpetuated in Cinhil 's descendants ever since . Such magic dealt primarily with protection  --  holding and keeping what was Haldane . But it was power to be called up without training and without real understanding , a compendium of set spells whose use and , indeed , very existence generally became apparent only when the need arose difficult to call to mind of one 's own inclination . A few casual skills there were of Haldane origin , like Truth-Reading and extendingp65one 's physical endurance , duplicating some Deryni functions , but the more subtle and satisfying uses of magic  --  and the ones most open to abuse  --  lay within the province of Deryni only . Indeed , most of the magic readily accessible to Kelson came from his Deryni blood , not Haldane sources : mostly what Morgan and Duncan had been able to teach him about that aspect of his heritage  --  and much of that still lay in the realm of theory . Now his meager experience with the two of them must be melded with the impersonal knowledge at his beck and call from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal situation here before him . Severaltimes in the past two years he had watched Morgan do this kind of thing  --  and had done it himself under Morgan 's guidance once or twice  --  but this was different : himself , alone , questioning someone he cared about  --  not some hostile prisoner , from whom the truth must be dragged by force . With Caulay 's natural discretion already lowered by the wine , Kelson was not too concerned about the actual procedure , but he was concerned about alienating Dhugal . The friends he could trust , who were not afraid of him , were few and precious . " If it should come to that , then I suppose I 'll have to do what I have to do , " he finally whispered , meeting Dhugal 's eyes miserably . " That 's one of the more unpleasant parts of being king . In the meantime , I 'm afraid this is something I have to do . " He paused a beat . " You do n't have to watch if you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put you to sleep , blur the memory . Neither of you has to remember . " Dhugal 's jaw tightened visibly , the sun-amber eyes scared and a little desperate . " If that 's what you want , I 'll  --  bow to your wishes , of course , butdammit , Kelson , I wo n't let myself be afraid of you ! God knows , I do n't understand what you 've become , and if you 'd rather I did n't watch , I  --  I 'll let you put me to sleep or whatever you feel you have to do . I do n't want to leave , though . " The courage and blind trust blazing in Dhugal 's face as he looked up precluded all further discussion . Kelson 's grateful " Stay , then , " was more mouthed than said , but Dhugal understood . His shaky smile and Kelson 's quick , answering grin were all the further comment necessary . Together they moved back into the room where Caulay slept , Kelson no longer worried . The old man snored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed and drew a few deep breaths to compose himself , centeringas Morgan had taught him . He did not touch Caulay , for he did not wish to alarm Dhugal in these early stages . Dhugal , initially skittish ,  |p66claimed  a stool on the opposite side of the bed and settled down to watch ; but gradually even he responded to the calm and stillness radiating from the king . Like Kelson , his breathing soon slowed to a shallow , even cadence , nimble surgeon 's fingers intertwined passively in the lap of his kilt , thumbs brushing tip to tip . Reassured , Kelson shifted attention from his own slow breathing to that of Caulay , gently spreading his right hand across the old man 's forehead and letting his thumb and little finger rest lightly on the closed eyelids for a few seconds . He could sense the blur of the alcohol as he sent his consciousness cautiously into Caulay 's , but he quickly bypassed that to make the necessary connections for what must be done , closing his eyes as he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Caulay , " he whispered . Dhugal 's tiny start of surprise caused Kelson to glance up momentarily , and instinctively he sent a tendril of reassurance in the other 's direction . He did not think Dhugal sensed it on any conscious level , but the young border lord seemed to relax again almost immediately , releasinga guarded sigh as he leaned forward to gaze at his father 's placid face . " Stay deep asleep and hear only my voice , " Kelson went on , returning his attention to the old man . " You can hear every word I say , even though you 're asleep , and you 'll want to answer my questions as fully as you can . Do you understand ? " " Aye , " came the blurred highland voice . As Dhugal glanced up at him in wonder , Kelson sat back and gave him a faint smile , crossing his arms casually on his chest . " He 's going to do just fine , " he murmured to Dhugal in an aside . " That 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first of all . Do you know where Sicard is right now ? " Caulay grimaced in his sleep . " Aye . " A precise answer to the question asked , but nothing volunteered . Looseningcontrol a little , Kelson reframed his question . " Good . And where is that ? " " Ach , I suppose he 's in that keep o ' his in Laas  --  he an ' his schemin ' wife , " Caulay said . " I didnae like her from the day I first set eyes on her , but he would marry her . " His voice was more animated now , the tone so casual and glib that he might have been back at table , confiding opinions over a cup of good ale , except that his eyes were closed . " The Lady Caitrin ? " Kelson asked . " Aye , Cate Quinnell  --  an ' she callin ' herself a princess ! " Caulay went on contemptuously . " They 've become a brazen lot , an ' that 's for sure  --   |p67high  an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T is said they keep court as if she were a queen , and not upstart pretender . " Kelson nodded and relaxed control just a little more . He did not like the implications of what the old man was conveying , but the delivery was just about perfect . " As if she were a queen , eh ? " he repeated softly . " Weel , surely ye knew , lad  --  an ' ye must nae allow it tae go on . They say she takes liberties due only a sovereign . She that steals yer homage also steals yer honor . " Kelson could sense Dhugal bristling indignantly , but he stayed him with a gesture . This was not the time for righteous outrage . If Caulay was using homage in its legal sense , the situation in Meara was even more serious than he had been led to believe . Homage implied the granting of land in return for service  --  the military service of knights . If Caitrin of Meara was receiving homage as suzeraine of Meara " Caulay , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dhugal 's stunned face . " She swears knights tae her service , wi ' the promise o ' land when Meara is free again , " Caulay replied promptly . " An ' new knights hae been made . Even the two boys hae been knighted , an ' they younger than yerself ! " Kelson felt his own anger rising to match Dhugal 's , and he had to push it down with a conscious effort . " Who knighted them ? " " My brother , " came Caulay 's response , though not quite so promptly , this time . " I wouldna ' hae thought it possible  --  my own kin , that swore faith tae yer father , God bless ' im . I couldnae believe it mysel ' , when I heard the news . Young Ithel brags that he is a knight now , and will one day be Prince of Meara of his own account . Would he hae died at birth ! He is nae true MacArdry , an ' that 's for sure ! " " I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstart Ithel . " Tell me about this Ithel , then . I want to know everything you can remember . " And in Culdi , Alaric Morgan prepared to enter his own kind of grim , dark concentration , opening a red leather case half the size of his fist and dumping out a handful of polished cubes carved of ivory and ebony . They clicked against each other and the table top with solid , satisfying snicks as he set them down , reflecting dark and light as Morgan brought a single candle closer on the table before him . Quickly he arranged the cubes in the traditional pattern : four white inp68the center , forming a single larger square ; the four black set one to each corner , not quite touching . The champion 's signet on his right hand gleamed as well , as he poised his fingertips above the center of the white square , but he ignored it for the moment as he set his thoughts in order . The odd black and white dice were called Wards in the parlance of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure perimeterfortifications of a castle , for their function of defense . To set wards was to create a magical sphere of protection encompassing the area definedby the four points at which the individual wards were placed , containingthe energy within and restraining the entry of disruptive forces . Such protection was all but essential when one intended a magical operationsuch as Morgan planned  --  for to reach Kelson at such distance , and without prior preparation , would require that Morgan place his body in deep trance , oblivious to physical sensation or danger , while his mind ranged forth in search of the king . " Prime . " As he spoke the nomen of the cube in the upper left corner of the white square , he touched it with his fingertip and sent power into its matrix . Instantly the cube began to glow from deep within  --  milky , opalescent white . " Seconde . " The process was repeated with the cube at the upper right , with similar results . " Tierce . Quarte . " He was halfway through his preparation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could feel the power drain . Slowly and deliberately he drew deep breath : tangible cue to trigger the reversal of polarities from white to black , positive to negative , male to female , the other side of the balance . The pull this time would be subtly different , slightly more difficult to channel , but well within his abilities . Breathing out softly , he brought his fingertip toward the black cube resting near the upper left of the white square . " Quinte . " A tiny spark jumped between his fingertip and the cube just before they touched , green-black fire kindling from within . Quickly , before his momentum was lost , Morgan shifted his attention to the upper right black cube , bringing his forefinger nearer . " Sixte . " Again , the eerie glow . When the process had been repeated for Septime and Octave , all eight of the cubes shimmered with internal light , four white and four black.  |p69Now  for the mating of opposites , the balancing of energies to build the watchtowers . Rubbing a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shifting his balance points again and readjusting control as he brought the cube near its black counterpart , Quinte . He could feel the tug of the opposites attracting as he closed the distance , the black cube almost seeming to rise that last fraction of space to meet the white as he spoke the word of power . " Primus . " The two cubes fused in a single , silvery grey oblong . One down . Breathing deeply , Morgan pushed the completed first ward a little to one side and plucked Seconde from its fellows , mating it to Sixte . " Secundus . " Again , the silver-glowing rectoid . When he had completed Tertius and Quartus , he set the four wards on the floor around his chair like tiny , glowing towers and sat down again , feeling for the balance points in his mind a final time before he set things into motion . Commanding now , he pointed to each of the wards in turn and spoke the words , sensing the surge as the elements meshed and flared . " Primus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was like suddenly being inside a tent of pale , silvery light . The very air around him seemed to shimmer . As he lowered his arm and sat back in his chair , he could feel the wards like an insulating cocoon , shielding and protecting . Satisfied , he adjusted the candle again and laid his hands along the arms of his chair , positioning the signet on his right hand to catch the light . It was a tangible symbol of the faith binding friend to friend , protectorto sovereign ; the golden Haldane lion etched on the curve of the gold-set onyx oval seemed to stare at him in the dimness . Morgan used it now as a focus , willing himself to still and center , conjuring the king 's face over the lion 's . He could feel his breathing slowing , his pulsebeat steadying , and graduallyhis vision began to narrow until only the ring was in his gaze . Doggedly he held Kelson 's image before his mind , letting his eyelids droop lower , lower , until they closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body receded as the mental image sharpened , and as he stretched his senses northward , all his concentration was centeredon the ring , the face , the mind.  |p70After  a long while , almost at the limits of perception , he at last sensed what he had come to find . And in Transha , immersed in his questioning of Caulay and the concentrationneeded to maintain control , Kelson pushed aside the first vague brushing at his mind . He and Dhugal listened with horrified fascinationas the old man wove a tale of treachery far more widespread than either of them had dreamed . But as Caulay reiterated the rumors he had heard of knights gone over to the Mearan Pretender and of Ithel Quinnell 's growing popularity , a hint of Morgan 's urgency began to penetrate  --  though not its source , at first . The king tensed as it brushed for the first time at a conscious level , momentarily shutting out Caulay 's rambling as he tried to track it down . When it proved too elusive , he laid a hand on the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hush for a minute , " he whispered . He closed his eyes to listen better . Nothing . Then the lightest of feather-brushes . He sensed it might be Morgan , but even when he turned all his concentration toward picking up the next touch , he could not be sure of more than the touch sensation . " What is it ? " Dhugal whispered , leaning closer on his stool . " Is something wrong ? " Carefully , Kelson shook his head , trying not to lose the all too tenuous contact hovering at the edge of consciousness . " Not here , " he murmured . " Someone 's trying to reach me , though  --  very far away and very faint . And it 's urgent . " A little catch of breath from Dhugal 's direction , and the sense of awe and apprehension mixed . Then : " Do you know who it is ? " Kelson nodded slowly , still straining to make it clearer . " Morgan , I think . I can't -- quite  --  pull it in . " " Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He is , so far as I know . And at this range , for me even to be aware of this much is incredible . " Slowly he opened his eyes to look across at Dhugal , though he kept tenuous touch with the continuing call . The sense of urgency persisted , as did the growing conviction that the source was Morgan . After all he had done already , Kelson knew he had no chance of bringing the contact through on his own , but there just might be another way . It was much to ask , however . " What is it ? " Dhugal breathed . " Why are you looking at me that way ? "  | " Did you mean what you said before , that you would n't let yourself be afraid of me ? " Kelson countered . Dhugal turned a little pale beneath his coppery hair , and Kelson could sense the queasy apprehension rising in his chest . " What are you going to do ? " Dhugal whispered . " No , make that , What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for something , do n't you ? To help you reach Morgan . " " Yes . " Kelson glanced briefly at the sleeping Caulay . " I need one or both of you to augment my strength . His might be enough , but I 'd like you in the link as well . " Dhugal swallowed hard , making no attempt to hide his fear . " M-me ? " With a sigh , Kelson managed a none-too-patient nod . He was finding it increasingly difficult to concentrate on reassuring Dhugal and still maintainwhatever contact he had with whoever was trying to reach him , but a slightly different approach was already taking shape in his mind . " It 's the not-knowing that 's the worst , is n't it ? " he guessed . " You see Caulay , obviously unconscious , and you 're afraid of what might happen to you  --  and that you would n't even know . Loss of control . " " I  --  suppose so . " Nodding again , Kelson stood and came around the end of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stool and started to back away . " Let 's try something a little different from what I originally had in mind , then , " he said , climbing onto the stool and motioning for Dhugal to come behind him . " This should n't be nearly as frightening . I need physical contact to make my link with you , but there 's no reason you ca n't control that instead of me . It will make my part a little trickier with you completely conscious , but I 'm willing to give it a try , if you are . " " What do I have to do ? " Dhugal replied warily . " Just stand behind me and put your hands on my shoulders . Let your thumbs rest on the back of my neck . " " Like this ? " Dhugal whispered , as he gingerly obeyed . " That 's fine . " Kelson took Caulay 's flaccid left hand and cradled it against his knee , then glanced over his shoulder as he straightened . " Now come a little closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's going to seem like I 've fallen asleep  --  rather like what I did to Bertie yesterday  --  and I do n't want to fall off the stool . Do n't laugh ! " he added , as he sensed Dhugal 's surprise . " I really am going to be somewhat at your mercy . "  |p72He  could feel Dhugal 's whole body tense behind him . Then , in a very faint voice : " Kelson , I 'm not sure I can do this . " " Yes , you can , " he said patiently . " Dhugal , there 's absolutely no danger . If you should freeze up , which is most unlikely , the worst that can happen is that I wo n't make the contact . Now , trust me , all right ? " He reached back to touch Dhugal 's forearm in brief reassurance . " Take a few deep breaths to relax now , and try to let your mind go blank . " He followed his own instructions and felt Dhugal 's cautious response . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out slowly . Close your eyes . Imagine all the tension flowing out of your body as you exhale . Let yourself drift now , " he continued , as Dhugal edged into light rapport . " You 're doing just fine . Soon I 'm going to bring your father into the link , but if he ca n't provide enough power I 'll need to draw from you as well . You may not even be aware of it . At most , you 'll feel a slight sort of a tickling sensation in your head . Breathe again now , deeply .... " While he let Dhugal continue settling , Kelson turned his attention briefly to Caulay , reaching out tendrils of control as Morgan and Duncan had taught him and tying in the potential . He had not expected it to be enough , so he was not disappointed . At least he was able to confirm that it was Morgan he was seeking , and that Morgan sensed a mutual effort to bring the contact through . He could feel Dhugal 's untapped potential towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too tentative for comfort , and knew he would have to go a little farther than he had told Dhugal he would . Gently he reached out with his senses and brushed Dhugal 's mind , keying the triggers which would enable him to slip Dhugal into a light control trance despite what he had said , for he could not afford to have Dhugal falter in midcontact . Gradually Dhugal 's head nodded lower , lower , until finally his chin was resting against the top of Kelson 's head , though he was not truly asleep  --  only drifting in a placid , twilight state . After another few heartbeats , Kelson turned his attention back to the waiting contact , opening his mind to fill with Morgan 's message . Well done , my prince , came Morgan 's whispered thought in his mind . I really was n't certain I could reach you . Who else is in the link ? Caulay and Dhugal , Kelson replied . And Dhugal is still partially conscious , so try not to let anything surge , or he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He caught the impression of laughter , like tinkling silver bells , and then a more sober note.  |p73A  brave lad and a true friend , Morgan sent . Why do n't you bring him back to Culdi with you ? I 'm needed already ? Kelson queried . Aye . Cardiel asked me to contact you . He and Arilan have in mind to promote Istelyn to the See of Meara , and they 'd like your official opinion . I told them I thought you 'd approve , but you ought to do it in person . The logic of the request was apparent , and the importance of the summonsbeyond question , but Kelson sensed something more , vague and less pleasant , lurking beneath the surface . Dhugal stirred , perhaps sharingsome of that uneasiness , and Kelson had to tighten his control just a little . What 's wrong ? he asked . What is it you have n't told me ? Someone tried to kill Duncan earlier this evening  --  merasha on the dagger . What ? One of his own retainers  --  hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dead . And Duncan ? As his own shock and concern reverberated in the link , he could feel Dhugal tense and try to withdraw . Relentlessly he clamped down on the controls , determined to hold the link just a little longer , even if doing so frightened Dhugal . He 's all right ! Morgan 's reassurance came lancing through . A bad slash on his palm that I can probably heal in the morning , and the expected aftereffects from the drug , but no permanent damage . Just get back as soon as you can . The emotion behind Morgan 's thought was controlled , but very powerful . Despite Kelson 's attempt to buffer its intensity , Dhugal recoiled at the alien sensation ; the link began to quiver . No longer trusting the luxuryof worded communication , Kelson sent agreement and an urgency to break contact for Dhugal 's sake  --  and was out of the link , as much pushed as of his own volition . As he twisted around to grab the trembling Dhugal by the wrists , he continued to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come through Morgan 's perception  --  only now it was coming from Dhugal . " Stop it ! " he whispered harshly , giving Dhugal a shake and trying to force reason past the panic . " Look at me , Dhugal ! Take a deep breath and listen ! Let it go ! You 're all right . Duncan is all right . Will you  --  " As his mind probed at Dhugal 's , bright pain seemed to explode behind his eyes , rebounding against his swiftly raised shields and somehow echoingback to Dhugal with even greater force . Dhugal cried out , doublingp74up and sinking to the floor despite Kelson 's attempt to support him , then lay there sobbing blindly  --  dry , wracking heaves as he gasped for breath , rocking in Kelson 's arms . Kelson was stunned . As he held the shuddering Dhugal and tried to comfort him , he could find nothing to account for the reaction . With the breaking of the link with Morgan , Dhugal should have felt nothing further . But when Kelson at last tried another tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he whispered , withdrawing as quickly as he could and thrusting Dhugal far enough away to stare at him in shock . " Mother of God , Dhugal , where did you get shields ? Can you hear me , Dhugal ? You 've got shields ! Dhugal , are you all right ? " Groggily , Dhugal uncurled and managed to sit up , holding his head with one hand and leaning against Kelson 's knee for support . Kelson did not press him for further response , only waited while Dhugal got his bearings and gradually raised his head , dragging a sleeve across his tearstainedface . His gaze was still a little glassy as he looked up at the king , and he seemed to be having trouble focusing . " Dhugal , what happened ? " Kelson breathed . Dhugal made a brave attempt at a smile . " I was about to ask you the same question . God  --  my head hurts ! " " Somehow you managed to pick up some of what Morgan was sending me , " Kelson whispered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you do that ? " " Do what ? " " Shield . Most humans ca n't . Everything was fine until Morgan told me about the attack on Duncan , and the merasha . " " What 's merasha ? " Dhugal asked blankly . " Oh , sweet Tesu , of course you do n't know . It 's a drug . I do n't know where it comes from . But it muddles Deryni senses so that we  --  ca n't use our magic . I 've never had it used on me , but Morgan has  --  and now Duncan . And I know it was used to make my father vulnerable to Charissa 's magic , so she could kill him . " Dhugal shivered . " It sounds terrible . " " So was what happened when you tried to back out of the link ! And you 've got shields , for God 's sake ! He does n't , " he stabbed one hand toward the sleeping Caulay in a gesture of frustration , " and you did n't seem to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , What the devil happened ? Can you remember anything at all ? "  |p75Dhugal  rubbed at his temples and winced . " I ca n't think with you yelling at me . " " I 'm not yelling at you , I just have to know what happened , " Kelson said , a little less emphatically . " You scared the hell out of me . " " I scared the hell out of me , too . " Cautiously Dhugal took a deep breath and let it out slowly , not looking at Kelson as he tried to ease himself back to memory of the pain . " It 's still mostly a jumble , " Dhugal finally went on haltingly , " but I do remember that after you stopped talking , I got sort of  --  drowsy . " " That was my fault , " Kelson muttered . " I confess I did a little more than I 'd told you I was going to . But that should n't have made you react the way you did . What else do you remember ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing ... Something about bishops , too  --  and  --  and then a terrible pain in my head . " " That must have been Duncan and the merasha , " Kelson said , nodding . " Somehow , you got farther into the link than I thought just enough to channel some of the emotion . I was n't expecting shields , though . Caulay does n't have them . " " He does n't have my knack with animals , either , " Dhugal countered , almost a little irritated , " and he used to be as good a tracker as Ciard . " He paused . " Maybe it does have something to do with the Second Sight , though . Maybe  --  maybe shields go along with that . " " Maybe , " Kelson replied . But Dhugal 's comment about the animals had struck a responsive chord in Kelson , so that the part about the Second Sight barely even registered . He recalled his father telling him how Morgan could charm deer to the very gates of the city if he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Bronwyn being able to call the birds from the sky . If their ability came of being Deryni , then what about Dhugal ? Dhugal was also good with animals  --  and that would certainly account for the shields . " Let 's try this again , " he said , slipping his hands to either side of Dhugal 's head before the other could object . " Try not to fight me . This is the only way we 're going to find out more about what we 're up against . " But Dhugal gasped and tried to pull away at once as Kelson 's first probe clashed against the shields again . " God , what are you doing to me ? " " I do n't want to hurt you , " Kelson answered . " Try to relax . I 'll ease up while you do , but you 've got to help me . Do n't fight me , dammit ! The more you struggle , the more it 's going to hurt ! "  |p76But  the pain of Kelson 's probe had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddering fetal ball . Kelson tried several approaches , but the shields refused to budge . He could also sense Dhugal 's heartrate rising dangerously . He would have to stop . " I 'm sorry , " he murmured , as he withdrew altogether . " God , I wish I knew where you got those shields ! " He doubted Dhugal had heard him , but he kept repeating his apology while he waited for Dhugal to come around , kneading the rigid shoulders until finally Dhugal stirred , uncurling enough to turn frightened , paindulledeyes on him . " I 'm sorry , " Kelson said again . " I did n't want to hurt you . I really am sorry . Are you all right ? " Dhugal nodded groggily and sat up with Kelson 's help , lifting a hand in reassurance . " It is n't your fault . It 's mine . I did try to do what you asked , but it hurt so much  --  " " I know . " Kelson glanced away , reviewing everything one more time , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't going to do us any good to just sit here and make apologies to one another . It 's no one 's fault . I certainly wish I did n't have to leave for Culdi tomorrow , though . " He raised an eyebrow hopefully . " I do n't suppose you 'd consider coming with me ? " " Because of  --  what just happened ? " Kelson nodded . " I ca n't . " Dhugal swallowed and turned half away , fiddling with a fold of his kilt . " It 's my father , Kelson . You 've seen how he is . Winter 's just beginning . I could n't leave him here alone . " " He would n't exactly be alone , " Kelson ventured . " Your sisters are here , and he has a whole clan family . Or is that really the reason ? " Dhugal drew a deep breath and let it out slowly , avoiding Kelson 's eyes . " That 's most of it . If he dies  --  no , make that when he dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as Earl of Transha . I have responsibilities to my people . It  --  makes things very difficult if the new chief is n't around when the old chief passes . " Chilled , Kelson glanced up at the bed towering above them , though he could not see its occupant . " Caulay 's dying ? " " I doubt very seriously that he 'll last out the winter , " Dhugal said quietly . " He looks strong , but his heart  --  well , let 's just say that if he were a horse , I probably would have put him down months ago . There 's  --  something wrong in his brain , too . He could n't even talk for a whilep77after he lost the use of his legs , though that came back after a few months . " " I 'm truly sorry . " " So am I. " Dhugal gave a resigned sigh . " Unfortunately , that does n't change anything . I doubt even your Deryni healers could have done much for him . The least I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's possible . Of course , if he does last out the winter , I have another problem . Come spring , my place is at your side , leading the MacArdry levies . " But we 'll worry about that then , if it happens , " he concluded brightly . " As for the other , let 's not worry about that until then , either , shall we ? " With a helpless shrug , Kelson rose and helped Dhugal to his feet . " If you wish . Much as I 'd like to have you at court through the winter , I certainly ca n't fault your reasons for staying here . I do n't suppose there 's any real urgency about  --  what 's just happened . Whatever 's going on in your head has probably been that way for some time , so I doubt much will change by waiting until spring to find out more . " He and Dhugal moved silently back into the embrasure of the window seat , where Kelson pushed one of the moveable lights farther open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air as Dhugal stood beside him . " Strategically , nothing much is going to happen until spring either , " the king continued , after a few seconds . " Look out there . The storms are already brewing . In another month , the rains will more than double the travel time in this part of the kingdom ; in two , the snows will have doubled it again . Even your cousin Ithel , as much as he may want my throne , ca n't move any kind of effective army under those conditions . No , we have the winter to decide how to handle this . There may be some minor local disturbances , but no serious threat for at least five months . " Grim-lipped , Dhugal glanced back into the room , at the great bed wrapped in shadows and the man snoring noisily beneath the sleeping furs . " When there is a threat , I shall be there , my brother , " he said softly . And he held up his right hand with the faint scar etched across the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had happened that night  --  and there had been many moving moments . Wistfullyhe raised his own right hand and matched the faint scar across his own palm to the one on Dhugal 's . The memory of the making of those scars came flooding back all in an instant , as if the two of them stood once more by the sacred well , high on a wind-scoured hilltop at the edge of Candor Rhea . Kelson had been ten , Dhugal nearly nine.  | " Are you sure you really want to ? " Dhugal had asked , as they washed their grimy hands in water from the well . " My people count an oath as strong as blood , when blood has been shed . And what will your father say ? " " I do n't care what he says , after it 's done , " Kelson had replied . " He ca n't undo it , can he ? " " No . Nothing can undo it unless one of us is dead . " " Then we do n't have to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you and I are going to live forever , are n't we ? " He paused a beat . " Does it hurt much , do you know ? " Dhugal had looked a little greenish under his freckles . " I du n no , " he confided . " My brother Michael made bloodoath with his friend Fulk when they were younger than we are , and he said it hurt terribly  --  but I think Michael makes things up to scare me sometimes . " He swallowed . " It 's only a little cut , after all . If we 're going to be knights , we have to learn not to be afraid of getting wounded , do n't we ? " " I 'm not afraid , " Kelson had retorted , handing Dhugal his silvermounteddagger . " Here . Do it ! " He had actually been very much afraid , and so had Dhugal , but he had not allowed himself to flinch as Dhugal 's inexperienced hand drew the blade across his flesh . Fascinated , Kelson held his wrist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes from it when Dhugal laid the black-carved hilt of his own dagger across Kelson 's bloody fingers . The pommel had clasped a water-pale amethyst , and he remembered the blood staining it a darker hue as he drew the blade across Dhugal 's palm in a wound to match his own . " Say the words after me , " Dhugal had whispered , clasping his bloody hand to Kelson 's and looping a handkerchief to bind them . " I take you as my brother , of blood and of life . " " I take you as my brother , of blood and of life , " Kelson had repeated . " I call to witness the four airts  --  those are winds , " Dhugal added . " I call to witness the four airts , " Kelson agreed . " That so long as I have breath , I will stand by my brother with my life and my honor . . " With a little smile , the adult Kelson clasped his free hand around their joined ones and nodded . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , " he said quietly , not wanting to break the mood . " Do your filial duty through the winter , andp79keep the peace here in Transha for me , and then come to me at Culdi as soon as the passes are clear . " " I will , my lord , " Dhugal whispered . " And God keep us both safe until then . "  |p80They  only consult to cast him down from hisexcellency : they delight in lies : they bless with their mouth , but they curse inwardly.  --  Psalms 62:4By special request of the Archbishop of Rhemuth , the bishops at Culdi met in closed convocation early the next morning . In Duncan 's absence , Istelyn was drafted to serve as secretary for the proceedings . No one was more surprised than he when Cardiel proposed him as the next Bishop of Meara . To the relief of Cardiel and Arilan , support for Istelyn 's candidacy quickly grew . Once the stunned Istelyn 's praises had been sung by a bemused Archbishop Bradene , who had more cause than any other man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room did not join actively in his support , for Istelyn 's nomination provided an elegant solution to the Mearan problem . By noon , when the entire community met for High Mass , Archbishop Bradene was able to announce a unanimous decision from the pulpit . With few exceptions , the news was received with relief and general approval . One of those who did not approve of the bishops ' choice was Judhael of Meara , though his public reception of the news was gracious and obedient . As soon as was seemly after Mass , however , he tapped discreetlyon the door of his patron , Creoda of Carbury . The bishop 's secretaryadmitted him at once . " You could have warned me , " he said , when the secretary had shown him into Creoda 's presence and the formalities had been observed . Sighing , Creoda motioned Judhael to take a seat across from him , staying the priest-secretary with a similar gesture . Judhael sat . He was a youngish-looking man of ramrod-straight carriage , with hair gone prematurelysilver , in stark contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured Creoda accusingly , the hands also betraying his agitation as he played with a ring on his right hand . " These things happen , " Creoda muttered . " If it 's any consolation , you reacted precisely as you should have . Cardiel sprang the recommendation on us at an early meeting this morning . There was no way to warn you between then and Mass . I 'm sorry . " " So am I. " Judhael worried at his ring a moment longer , then glanced aside at the fire in the stone fireplace . The silver signet on his hand was more befitting a secular lord than a cleric . " What happens next , then ? " Judhael asked . " Is this the end of it ? Will the king ratify Istelyn 's appointment ? " " I do n't know , to all three questions , " Creoda replied . " Istelyn has been in the king 's favor for several years , so I doubt there will be any objection on the part of His Majesty . That does not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ? " Creoda snapped his fingers in the direction of the secretary and held out his hand for the folded square of parchment which the man immediatelyproduced . Judhael sat forward expectantly , but Creoda took his time unfolding the missive . " This came late last night , " the bishop said , holding it at arm 's length and squinting at the text before handing it over to Judhael . " The gist of it is that our brother in Saint Iveagh 's is prepared to support you , and awaits the guide who will escort him to freedom . " " And how much is that support worth , now that someone else has been chosen for the See of Meara ? " Judhael said bitterly , as he scanned the closely penned script . " It will be as useful as it needs to be , " Creoda replied . " At very least , he can pull the ecclesiastical factions together for the reunification of Old Meara . " " You really think he still wields that much influence ? " " He might surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a bit fanaticfor some people 's tastes , but I have always known him to be an upright and godly man . His treatment at the hands of the king rankled many , myself among them . He was our elected primate , after all . " " And a fanatic , " Judhael reminded his superior , as he handed the missive back to the priest beside him . " You yourself have conceded that . " Creoda shrugged narrow shoulders and smiled a thin , smug smile . " Please , Father . Grant me credit for some common sense . Just because one describes our one-time master as a godly man does not necessarily mean one thinks he should be primate once again . "  | " Not primate ? " Judhael stared at the bishop in blank astonishment . " But , I thought  --  " " Do n't think , Father , " Creoda replied softly . " Let me do the thinking . There are other things at stake besides your Mearan See . The less you know , the better . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can force a man to speak the truth , Father , " Creoda went on . " And God alone knows what unholy things his Deryni friends can do . But one can not speak of what one does not know , now , can one ? My silence is for your protection as well as mine , my son . " Judhael 's face turned pale beneath his silver hair , and he hugged his arms across his chest as he suppressed a shiver . " Dear God in heaven , you 're right ! General Morgan stopped me on the way out of chapel last night . I could n't avoid him . He wanted to know whether I had any knowledge of an assassination attempt on Mc-Lain . " " An assassination attempt ? " " You were n't behind it , then ? " " Certainly not ! What happened ? " Judhael looked confused as he shook his head . " I do n't know for certain . Apparently there was a boy with a knife . It ca n't have been too serious , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting next to Morgan . " " So he was . " Creoda stared into space for a few seconds , then shook his head . " No matter . It does n't concern us . Any number of people might want a Deryni priest dead . " " Or a Deryni duke , " Judhael added . " He 's that , too , do n't forget . My aunt and my cousins would n't mind . " When Creoda looked puzzled , Judhael continued a little disdainfully . " Can you have forgotten , Excellency ? Because it has no immediate ecclesiastical significance does n't mean it is n't important . As Duke of Cassan and Earl of Kierney , Duncan McLain has no direct heir . By strict right of succession , his lands should pass to Ithel after he dies  --  not that the king would allow it . " " Ah , then , Morgan felt you had a motive , " Creoda breathed . " Which , in fact , you did . That 's why he wanted to question you . Are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll confess to that . He did want to know how long it had been since I 'd heard from my aunt . And he has to be aware how my elevation to the See of Meara could have helped the cause of Mearan independence . " " That is hardly any secret , " Creoda observed dryly . " But , very well.  |p83We  must assume that in the future he 'll be even more observant  --  which simply confirms my instinct that you should know as little about the rest of our plans as possible , until the deeds are done . Do you agree ? " " I have no real choice , it seems . " " No , you do not . Therefore , for the time being , I advise you to bide your time , support Istelyn with grace  --  and stay as far as possible from Morgan or any other Deryni . There are too damned many of them around , as it is . " Judhael inclined his head in assent . " Good . I think you 'd best return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And stay there , as much as possible . No one will think it odd if you keep to yourself for a few days . I gather that the king is expected back tomorrow or the day after , and I anticipate a mass exodus to Ratharkin for Istelyn 's investiture shortly thereafter . I hope we will be ready to make our move soon after that . " " I shall bow to your judgment , Excellency , " Judhael murmured , kneeling in formal leave-taking to kiss the bishop 's ring and receive his blessing . When Judhael had gone , Creoda glanced aside at his secretary . " Is Gorony 's messenger still waiting in the next room ? " he asked . " Yes , Excellency . " " Very well . Ask him to come in , then , and bring your inks and vellums . We have work to do . " Two days later , the king returned to Culdi . A delegation of bishops met him outside the city gates and conducted him with due ceremony to the chapter house , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sent ahead on several different roads to intercept the king and apprise him of the bishops ' intentions , so an informedKelson was able to grant his royal approval on the spot . He dined with Istelyn and a few other intimates that evening , then retired with Morgan and a mostly-recovered Duncan later that night ; the three of them exchanged details of what had transpired in the days of Kelson 's absence . The following morning , the entire royal party made the daylongride to Ratharkin , to witness Istelyn 's installation the following day . That night , however , while king and court rested in Ratharkin and the new bishop-elect kept vigil with several of his brethren in a nearby monasticchapel , a man in monk 's robes made his way along the silent corridors of another monastery far to the east and north , close by the sea . The prisoner of Saint Iveagh 's paced impatiently as metal picked at the workings of his door lock from the other side , fearing at each new scrapep84or click that the sound would raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door swung back at last , was that of the monk who had confessed him earlier in the week : the preacher Jeroboam , whom he had been told to expect . Jeroboam inclined his head for Loris ' blessing , then signed that lie should remove his sandals . The bare feet of the two made no sound as they descended the tower newel to make good their escape . It was the hour between Matins and Lauds , when all the abbey slept . Only now might they hope to traverse the abbey 's corridors without danger of meeting someone . As they skirted the night stairs , close by the monks ' dorter , Loris hardly dared to breathe . Once past , he could breathe , but their route became a maze of unfamiliar turns and jogs . He had no idea where he was . Another descending stair gave way to downward-sloping corridor , then to rock-hewn tunnel , then to rough sea cave  --  and a harrowing descent of the remainder of the cliff face by rope , to board a waiting curragh . Loris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the curragh left the shelter of the cove and headed out through the swells , not relaxing until a ship suddenly loomed out of the fog ahead , spars stark and skeletal in the darkness . As he scrambled aboard , the master of the ship tugged at his forelock and gave silent signal for the crew to begin rowing . " God prosper Your Excellency in your work , " said a muffled voice , kneeling shadow-vague to grasp the newcomer 's hand and kiss it . " Gorony ? " Loris whispered , raising the man to peer and then embrace him . " Gorony , Gorony , I feared never to see you again , or to taste freedom ! Oh , I am well blessed with such service ! " Gorony pulled away far enough to incline his head in thanks , smiling contentedly . " I had powerful allies , my lord . But not powerful enough , I fear , to prevent your enemies from making our task more difficult from this point on . The Lord Judhael was not elected to the See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest Henry Istelyn in Ratharkin , before the king and most of his court . " " Istelyn ? Damn ! " Slamming one fist into his other palm , Loris half turned away from Gorony , moving farther into the bow . The wind was freshening as the ship ghosted further from the shelter of the sea cliffs , and canvas rustled and snapped as the crew hoisted the sail aloft and caught the air . " Do you know how it happened ? " Loris asked , after taking a moment to subdue his anger . Gorony shrugged . " Not in detail , Excellency , but one gathers that the Deryni McLain had a hand in it . Incidentally , I regret to report that ourp85diversion was unsuccessful . McLain still lives and will himself be consecratedbishop at Easter , to serve Cardiel . " " A viper in the episcopate ! " Loris spat vehemently over the rail . " What about our agent ? Did he talk ? " " Apparently not . McLain killed him during the attack . Fortunately , not even Deryni can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ah , then the boy did manage to wound him . " " Aye , though not deeply enough to do real damage : a slash across one palm , from what I hear . Apparently Morgan was able to heal that , though not right away , with the merasha in it . McLain was quite up to attending Mass the next noon , and seemed to bear no sign of the wound . " " Blast him for the Deryni heretic he is !  --  that both of them are !  --  and that is going to be a bishop ! " He indulged an explosive sigh , then glanced at Gorony more mildly . " How does this change our plans , then , my friend ? You 've worked miracles enough , simply to get me out of Saint Iveagh 's , but there 's no way we can reach Ratharkin in time to prevent the investiture . " " That 's true , my lord . However , by the time we can reach Ratharkin , the king and his court will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , Meara 's new bishop will be guarded only by his garrison  --  and most of them owe obedience to the Bishop of Culdi or to Judhael him-self . " " Do they , indeed ? " Loris breathed . " Even so , my lord , " Gorony replied , smiling . " Nor does Bishop Creoda'ssupport end with the gaining of your freedom . He proposes to help you depose Istelyn and then consecrate Judhael in his place . The king wo n't even know for several weeks , if things go as they should  --  and the snows will make it almost impossible to do anything about it until spring . By then , you and the Princess Caitrin should be firm allies . " When Loris had digested the information , he nodded . " Creoda , too , has served me well . Have we a third bishop available , to make the validityof Judhael 's consecration beyond question ? " " We hope to  --  ah  --  ' persuade ' Istelyn to assist , " Gorony said carefully . " His cooperation would lend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps ease the situation through the winter . Failing that , Mir de Kiemey and several of the other itinerant bishops are remainingwithin easy access of Ratharkin . Once the city is secured , you sha n't lack for bishops to do your bidding . " " How many ? " Loris asked . " For now , perhaps as many as seven , not counting Judhael or yourself.  |p86Three  hold titled sees . " Gorony paused . " I should add that none of these know that you are involved besides Creoda and Judhael , though the cause of Mearan independence binds them all . However , I think they can be persuaded readily enough to support you , once it 's learned you plan to champion the Princess Caitrin . " Loris snortM under his breath , then glanced around behind them beforelooking at Gorony . " Do you think I care a whit about her , Gorony ? It 's my see I want back  --  and I want the Deryni who took it from me . I want them very badly . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gorony smiled . " You 'll find these bishops far more biddable than the last lot  --  and by starting with a united Meara , there 's nothing to prevent the creation of more bishops who will do as you ask them . Meara can be but the first step . " Ah , Gorony , you do understand quite well , do n't you ? " Loris murmuredappreciatively . " I 'll not forget , I promise you . " He sighed as he glanced out at the blank sea ahead . " How long before we make landfall ? I am eager to be about our work . " " Tomorrow , dawn . From there , it 's two or three days ' ride to Ratharkin . We expect no opposition . Why do n't you rest , my lord ? " " Thank you . I believe I shall . And I may even sleep  --  now . " Sleep had fled Saint Iveagh 's not long before , however , the abbot suspendingthe Office of Prime for the first time in thirty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brethren hastily assembled in Loris ' empty chamber was nearly weeping , his voice barely audible , even though the abbot had already dispensed all in the room from the Order 's Rule of speaking in a whisper save during Divine Office . " I can not explain it , Father Abbot . He is simply gone . He asked to attend Vespers , so that he might hear Brother Jeroboam preach , and I myself locked his door when he returned . Here is the key . " He extended it in both hands , not looking up . " I will swear on whatever holy relics you require that it has not been out of my possession . " Another monk stepped forward from the ranks and knelt beside the distraught man . " It is true , Father Abbot . Brother Wenceslaus had the key when he returned from escorting Father Loris back to his room . He and I kept vigil in the Lady Chapel until Compline . Both of us looked in on Father Loris before retiring , but he seemed to be asleep  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no occasion to check on him again until we came to rouse him for Prime . "  |p87The  abbot , rumpled and disheveled in a hastily donned mantle pulled over his sleeping gown , sank wearily onto a stool and sighed . " Then , he could have been missing for many hours , " he murmured . " How can this have happened ? Brother Wenceslaus , please believe that I do not hold you personally to blame , but could there possibly have been a second key ? " Another brother , bending to inspect the door latch by the light of a candle another monk held , tut-tutted primly to himself and shook his head as he glanced up at the abbot . " I doubt there was another key , Father Abbot . The lock shows definite signs of tampering  --  perhaps one of the tinkers who paid us visit in the last few days . " He paused a beat . " Or some other stranger . I do n't supposeanyone has questioned Brother Jeroboam ? " The abbot shook his head miserably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing . Alas , it appears the good preacher was not what he appeared . That we did not recognize this is the fault of no one in this Order , but the fact remains that the prisoner entrusted to our charge has escaped . We have failed in our duty . " As he sighed again , the assembled brethren hung their heads guiltily . " Well , there is no help for it but to tell the king , my brethren  --  and told he must be , though I weep at the shame of it . " " The shame is all of ours , Father Abbot , " one of the monks murmured . " Yes , yes . " The abbot shook his head and sighed a third time . " Search a final time , my brothers . Perhaps we will find some further clue as to how this was accomplished . Meanwhile , I shall draft a letter to the king . Brother Hospitaller , I shall need a messenger to leave for Rhemuth at dawn . Do you see to his provisioning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon Mass that same day , the Feast of Saint Andrew , the Most Reverend Henry Istelyn of Rhemuth was officially proclaimed Bishop of Meara and invested with the symbols of his office . Enthroned in his cathedral of Saint Uriel and All Angels , flanked by his archbishops and brother prelates , and witnessed by King Kelson , he received the homage and obedience of every Mearan clergyman present , no one 's more gracefullyor humbly offered than Judhael 's . The king himself begged the favor of the new bishop 's first blessing , for he had fond memories of Istelyn 's loyalty during the campaign against Torenth , and he and his closest confidantsknelt with bowed heads as the age-tried words were spoken . That night there was feasting in the bishop 's hall.  |p88The  citizenry seemed reasonably content with their new prelate , but just to ensure a peaceful winter , Kelson gave Istelyn the loan of twenty sergeants and men-at-arms from his own warband ; Cardiel gave a like number of episcopal troops . These were to augment the garrison remainingfrom the tenure of the deceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score handpicked from Bishop Creoda 's levies . Creoda himself offered to remain in Ratharkin for a few weeks to assist Istelyn 's peaceful assumption of the real reins of power . It was a brotherly gesture which no one had cause to question . The worsening weather allowed no over-long lingering on the part of the king , however . With Istelyn apparently stable in his new-gained office , Kelson must return to Rhemuth to resume the governing of the rest of his kingdom . Troubles there might be during the long winter to come , but the king felt his new bishop tolerably well protected . He was merry as he rode out the Ratharkin city gates the following morning , he and his party in good spirits despite the light rain which was falling . Several of the other bishops who had come from Culdi for the installation intended to travel with the royal party until it was time to head off for their own holdings , so the journey had taken on almost a festival air . As the cavalcademade its way south , to broach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer route , neither Deryni nor humanin the royal van dreamed of the treachery brewing in the city they left behind  --  or the further treachery afoot but a few days farther north.  |p89The  words of his mouth were smoother thanbutter , but war was in his heart ; his words were softer than oil , yet were they drawn swords.  --  Psalms 55:21In the predawn stillness of the following day , the curragh carrying the once and future Primate of Gwynedd pulled away from a ship standing to off the Transha coast and glided silently toward a sheltered cove . The fragile craft bobbed and bucked as it ploughed through the breakers closer to shore , and its two passengers gripped the hide-covered gunwales a little anxiously , huddled deep in heavy mantles against the icy spray . As sand hissed under the keel , two seamen leaped into the surf to pull the craft farther onto the beach . Torches emerged from the early morning fog , gradually revealing armed men , darkly clad . Beyond , just audible above the crash of the surf , horses stamped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a low voice from among the torches called . As Loris stood a little unsteadily , the curragh teetered in the surf . " Brice ? " Immediately , the band 's leader and one of the torchbearers detached themselves from the rest and came forward . " Welcome to freedom , Your Excellency , " said Brice of Trurill . He handed Loris out of the boat and bowed over his gloved hand . " I hope your journey was not exceptionally tiring . " Loris staggered a little on the wet sand as he found his land legs , but Brice steadied him with a hand under his elbow as together they trudged up the steep incline of the beach . His companion assisted Gorony from the boat . As soon as both men were ashore , the seamen began pushing the craft back into the breakers . Offshore , the waiting ship briefly showed a light . " My thanks for your assistance , my son , " Loris murmured , puffing ap90little from the exertion of the climb . " Your service shall not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , Excellency . We 've purposely kept your escort small , to avoid arousing undue attention , but Gendon managed to locate several of your former guards from Valoret . All of us are sworn to your service . " He gestured toward his comrafles , waiting dark and faceless by the fidgeting greathorses , and as one , they bowed their heads in homage . With a satisfied nod , Loris raised his right hand in benediction and murmuredthe words of a blessing . Brice and Gendon also bowed their heads to receive it . When he had done , one of the men brought a pair of horses forward . Brice , after donning a helm with a baron 's coronet embossed around its crown , himself held the renegade archbishop 's stirrup so he could mount . " What is our destination ? " Loris asked , as he swung up and gathered the reins in gloved hands . Baron Brice of Trurill smiled as he mounted his own steed . " We ride to Ratharkin , Excellency , where more of your allies await us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only response he allowed himself as the rest of the party mounted up . As the men one by one hurled their torches into the surf , their dark forms blended with the rising fog once more . Jingling harnesses made but faint counterpoint to the waves as they quit the beach and headed south . Beyond the breakers , the ship lingered a moment longer , riding the long swells like a ghostly seabird , then was gone in the mist . Soon , the only sign of the predawn meeting was a scattering of burnt-out torch stubs drifting out to sea on the tide . Their passage had not gone unmarked , however . The pair of bearded scouts observing from their bellies on a cliff above the cove had tracked the black-clad warband since just before midnight . The presence of any group of armed men on Transha soil would have been cause for suspicion ; these seemed deliberately arrayed to disguise their identities and were certainly there without the leave of the MacArdry chief . The arrival of the ship had only increased the watchers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long spyglass , hissing in breath through his teeth as he watched the taller of the newcomers raise his hand in blessing . " I dinnae know who he is , but I like not th ' feel o ' this , " he whispered , handing off the spyglass to his companion . " Wha ' d'ye think they 're about ? "  |p91The  other grunted and put the spyglass to his own eye , watching silentlyfor several seconds before replying . " Nae guid , an ' that 's for certain . We must tell th ' laird . " " Aye . " They continued to watch until their quarry had mounted up and left , noting number , direction , and whatever other detail might be gained from such a vantage point . Soon they , too , had melted into the morning mist , settling quickly into a brisk , ground-eating pace as they headed back toward Castle Transha . " I dinnae think they wore livery or badges , sair , but a band that well armed an ' wi'out standard or banner smacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men reported an hour later , in the hall where the chief of the MacArdry and his heir broke their fast with a few other of their clansmen . " I 'm wagerin " t is Mearan mischief . " " Mischief , aye . I 'll grant ye that , " old Caulay muttered . " But why Mearan mischief , Alexander ? Have ye proof ? " Alexander shook his head . " Nae proof . A feelin ' is all . There 's sommat else , tho ' : At least one o ' the men who landed was a priest . He blessed th ' escort before they rode out . Now , why would a priest be makin ' secret rendezvous with rogue knights ? " Blearily Dhugal MacArdry rubbed sleep from his eyes and glanced at his father . The old man had had a bad night . Any physical leadership on the part of the ailing chief had been out of the question for some time ; this morning , Caulay was barely even able to follow the conversation  --  and knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Dhugal stood , tossing off the last of his morning ale . " I think we 'd best find out why , " he said , wiping the back of a linencladforearm across his mouth . " You say they 're headed toward Car-cashale ? " " Aye  --  unless they turn east at Colblaine , which I doubt . " " ' T is Carcashale for us as well , then . Caball , how many men can we muster in time to head them off ' ? " " Mayhap a dozen , " his father 's castellan replied . " I wish I could give ye more , but two patrols are out already  --  an ' many hae headed to their ain Names for th ' winter . It 's a bad time o ' year , lad . " " Aye , but there 's no help for that . We must ride wi ' what we have . " Dhugal sighed . " Tomais and Alexander , I 'll ask that ye join us  --  an ' Ciard as well . Will ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhugal . " As the men left to do his bidding , leaving only the clan piper andp92Kinkellyan the bard in the hall with the old chief and his heir , Dhugal turned back to his father . The old man 's eyes were troubled beyond his physical pain as he reached out a hand to clasp Dhugal 's . " This does nae sound guid , lad . I dinnae like it . Th ' priests an ' bishops hae been at Culdi all th ' past month . What cause has another priest tae come in secret this way ? An ' tae come by sea this time o ' year  --  " Tight-lipped , Dhugal nodded , stripping off linen and kilts to don riding leathers and light armor which his gillie brought . " Aye , I dinnae like it either , Da . An ' the king would 've told me if he 'd known of it . This smacks of treachery . But we 've no choice but to investi-gate . " " Aye , ye have not . But  --  be careful , lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced a grin as he squeezed the old man 's hand . " We 'll hear no more o ' that , Da . The clan has its chief , an ' will for many a year , the Lord willing . Besides , I 've nae finished my apprenticeshipwith ye . " The old man nodded and smiled as Dhugal pulled away to let Ciard finish arming him , but both of them knew it was a charade . Dhugal pretended to adjust a strap on his brigandine while Ciard looped a sword baldric over his head and brooched a heavy , fur-lined cloak at his throat . Then Dhugal was drawing on gauntlets and striding out of the hall , raising a hand in final farewell as he went . Minutes later , the Transha warband rode out the castle gates toward Carcashale . Two hours later , Dhugal and his men sat their shaggy border ponies stirrup to stirrup across the mouth of Carcashale pass  --  a position which would bring the approaching foreigners within a dozen yards of the Transha line before they were even aware they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , Ciard at his left with his personal standard and Caball far to the right with the Transha banner . The silks were almost gaudy against the grey December sky . From the point above , the signal came . As Dhugal drew his sword and raised it , steel slithered from a dozen other scabbards in answer . He shifted the leather-faced targe on his right arm and collected his pony 's reins . As the first of the black-clad intruders rounded the curve and faltered at the unexpected array awaiting them , Dhugal kneed his mount a few steps forward . " Stand , in the name of the king , and state your business ! " he said , letting his sword rest lightly against his left shoulder . " You trespass on the Earl of Transha 's lands . " But the men ahead were not inclined to parley . Even as Dhugal realizedthat , wheeling his pony in strategic retreat , they were spurring theirp93larger mounts from trot to gallop , bunching around the two unarmored men in their midst and drawing weapons as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled , trusting that the quicknessof their border ponies and intimate knowledge of the terrain would at least enable them to escape . The charging men did not fan out in general pursuit , however . To Dhugal 's astonishment and horror , the men at the head of the band made directly for him , the outriders brushing off his more lightly mounted and armed men with devastating results while the leaders drove straight toward him . " MacArdry , to me ! " he cried . His men tried to rally . Ciard got separated from him by a man on a particularly large and nasty bay which kicked and tried to bite , and Tomais darted desperately behind to take his place and shield him . But the strangers cut down the scout with hardly a wasted effort and then crashed their mounts into Dhugal 's , bowling it off its feet . Dhugal fell hard . He lost his helmet , but somehow he still had his sword in his hand as he scrambled to his feet . He glanced around wildly to find himself totally surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catching at the reins of one of his attackers with his free hand , he jerked and forced the animal to its knees , spilling its rider even as he blocked another man 's sword blow . But his astonishment at the Trurill badge on the surcoat beneath the fallen man 's mantle threw him off stride ; and before he could collect his wits , the steel-shod hoof of another man 's horse caught him in the thigh with near bone-crushing force . Even as he gasped with the pain of it , trying not to fall under yet another horse 's hooves , another rider kneed him in the chest , knocking the wind out of him and cracking ribs . Dimly he recognized his attacker as the Trurill sergeant with whom he had ridden only a fortnight before . " Gendon ! " he gasped , stunned . Wheezing desperately for air , and feeling horribly betrayed , he staggeredto his feet and managed to deliver a bloody but shallow cut to the arm of another attacker , but already injured , he was too slow to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground  --  or the sword hilt which struck his temple with a solid , sickening thump as the Baron of Trurill himself grabbed him by the neck of his brigandine and yanked him up across the saddle . He tried to struggle through the fog of pain which shrank his vision to a narrow tunnel , but his fingers uncurled from his sword hilt and let it fall as the pain pounded with every heartbeat . " Pull back , or I kill the boy ! " his captor bellowed , jerking him up straighter in the saddle before him and laying the flat of his sword againstp94Dhugal 's throat . " Will your chief thank you for a dead heir ? I swear , I 'll kill him ! " Dhugal 's eyes would no longer focus , and he could feel the bitter bile burning in his throat as waves of nausea pulsated with the pain . Even drawing breath sent jagged fire lancing through his chest , and his slightestattempt to struggle only made his captor 's arm clamp tighter over his broken ribs , adding to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle ceasing , and then Caball 's voice , breathless and desperate . " Yield yer prisoner , sir , in th ' name of King Kelson of Gwynedd ! Ye have attacked th ' king 's just representative wi'out cause . " " A heretic king ! " an irate voice behind Dhugal shouted . " And the heretic king has forfeited his rights by making heretics his allies . Stand aside and let us pass , or the boy dies ! " Weakly , Dhugal tried again to struggle despite the pain it cost him . He could not think clearly , but instinctively he sensed that to allow these men to escape was a thing which must be prevented at all cost , even his life . " No ! " he managed to cry out . " Do n't let them  --  " But the sword hilt crashed into his head again before he could finish , and he felt his world going dark around him , his body totally refusing to obey him any longer . He knew more pain as his captor pulled him higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of his belt , and he heard Clan MacArdry 's warcry as they tried to answer his command . But then consciousness was slipping away even as his captor charged into the fray again , and he knew no more . Caball MacArdry and the remnants of Dhugal 's command limped their way back through the gates of Castle Transha just at dusk . They brought two dead with them , and not a man among the living had escapedunscathed . One prisoner they had managed to take , lashed to the saddle of Dhugal 's protesting pony , but only because he had been too badly injured to ride with his comrades . Were it not for the fact that they hoped to question him , Caball gladly would have cut his throat without further ceremony . All during the slow , painful ride back from Carcashale , the devastated Caball had rehearsed the possible ways of telling old Caulay that his son was captured . In the end , he could only let Dhugal 's absence speak for itself . He dared not meet the old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt at the foot of the chief 's chair in the great hall.  |p95Caulay  stiffened as his rheumy eyes searched the faces of the six and did not find Dhugal . " We met them at Carcashale , sair , " Caball said in a low voice , blood seeping between his fingers where he clutched at a wound in his right shoulder . " Brice of Trurill led them . He has turned traitor . " " And my son ? " Caulay managed to rasp . " Taken , " was all Caball could whisper miserably . He tried to tell Caulay that they believed Dhugal still to be alive , though wounded  --  and that Caball would send out the fiery cross to summon the clan and pursue  --  but the news was the final blow to Caulay'salready frail health . Without uttering a sound , the old man clutched at his chest and sagged in his chair , eyes rolling up and out of sight . He died within seconds , cradled in the arms of Kinkellyan the bard , his helpless kinsmen able to do nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his own injuries , Caball had the alarm rung and summoned the remaining clansmen at Transha to the great hall  --  young boys and old men , for the most part , though some of the women came to tend the wounded . Stripped to the waist so his own wounds could be cared for , Caball sat on a stool beside the slumped body of the dead chief as the others gathered before him , one hand gripped tight on the edge of the table against the pain . As castellan and next in succession after Dhugal , it had become his grim duty to assume the leadership of the clan until Dhugal 's condition should be learned . He winced as his wife and Kinkellyan began washing out his wound , trying to ignore the bard 's troubled muttering . " Young Dhugal is our chief now , " he told the assembled men , " if he lives . I dinnae know what his captors will do wi ' him , but since they didnae kill him when they first threatened , we must hope he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of the men rumbled . " If young Dhugal still lives , then he must be rescued  --  an ' if he be dead , then he must be avenged ! " " Aye , an ' where is the prisoner ? " another demanded . " Before we gae chargin ' off tae take on rebel knights , we should first find oot wha ' we be dealin ' with . " " Ciard , bring him , " Caball ordered , waving off those tending his wound as the gillie and another clansman went to do his bidding . The prisoner 's face was pale as whey , his sword arm splinted and bound to his chest , but he managed to stay on his feet as he was marched roughly to the dais . Though they had stripped him down to woolen singlet and boots and breeches beneath his black mantle , he still wore a rust-stained arming cap on his head . He bit back a groan as he wasp96shoved to his knees before Caball , only barely catching himself on his good hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man ! " Ciard barked , yanking back the man 's coif and shoving his head closer to the floor . The man 's lank hair was cut in the bowl-shaped hairstyle favored by many warriors , but a tonsured spot gleamed at the crown . As the significanceregistered , Caball seized a fistful of hair and yanked the man 's head up to look at his face , heedless of the blood streaming down his wounded arm . ' By the good God , he 's a cleric an ' come armed among us ! " Caball breathed . " Look a ' the tonsure ! What 's yer name , priest ? Wha ' master d'ye serve , who sends priests armed into the king 's lands ? " The man merely grimaced and closed his eyes as Caball twisted the handful of hair harder . " Speak up , priest ! I hae little patience t'day . " " I have nothing to say , " the man whispered . " Dinnae waste yer time wi ' such slime , Caball ! " one of the clansmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gie ' im a traitor 's reward . " " Aye , hang him , Caball ! " " Touch me and your lands go under Interdict the instant my master hears of it ! " the prisoner responded , opening blue eyes defiantly . " He 'll excommunicate the lot of you . I claim benefit of clergy and the right to ecclesiastical trial . You have no authority to judge me . " " Interdict ? " one of the men murmured , as several others crossed themselves . Caball gave the man 's hair another vicious twist . " Mind yer tongue , priest ! Yer traitor master can nae save ye here ! Speak up . Who are ye ? " Consternation flickered across the man 's face for just an instant , but still he shook his head stubbornly . " I do not have to answer to you . " " No , but ye may well wish ye had , " Caball replied , releasing the man with a shove that overbalanced him into a groaning heap on the floor . " An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caball backed off unsteadily and leaned against the edge of the table , catching Ciard 's eye as he let his wife and Kinkellyan return to their ministrations . " Ciard 0 Ruane , as gillie to our young laird , I give ye the charge o ' tellin ' the king what has occurred . Spare neither self nae steed , sae lang as ye reach Rhemuth quickly . If the king is nae there now , he will arrive shortly , so wait . "  | " Aye , Caball . " " As for the prisoner , " he smiled menacingly as he turned his eyes back on the defiant captive , " a suitable escort shall follow ye tae Rhemuth on the morrow . ' T is only for this that we spare ye , priest . An ' know that th ' king is bloodkin to our young laird , an ' will be greatly wroth if any further harm should come to him . Ye 'd best pray that yer master does nothing rash . Take him out " As the prisoner was jerked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a grim Ciard following , Caball collapsed back against the edge of the table . Behind him , a gillie handed Kinkellyan the cloth-wrapped end of a glowing iron . " Devlin , send out the fiery cross to summon the seven chieftains , " Caball said to the clan 's gleeman , who stepped forward at his name . " An ' let th ' piper sound the corranach tae speed Th ' MacArdry on his way . " He steeled himself as Devlin and another man moved in to hold him for Kinkellyan 's work . " An ' let the women prepare The MacArdry 's body for his final rest , " he went on . " Until we hear otherwise , young Dhugal is our new chief , an ' I shall direct the clan only in his  --  " The hiss of the hot iron searing flesh cut off further speech , and Caball 's body arched with the agony , though he uttered not a sound . He slumped into merciful unconsciousness before it was done , so he did not hear the lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women keening as they drew around the body to take it away . Those who had ridden with the new chief heard it , however ; and Ciard 0 Ruane , as he mounted a fast horse to ride for Rhemuth , hoped desperatelythat the corranach was not for the young laird as well as the old . Dhugal MacArdry would have deemed the piper 's lament wholly appropriatein the days which followed , though he stubbornly refused to die . Nor , it seemed , did his captors wish him dead . He vaguely recalled shouted threats to do him harm , when he first had been taken , but he sensed that his captors considered him a hostage of some value . When he first regained consciousness , they were bandaging his head , though nothing was done about his cracked ribs . He passed out again when they made him stand to put him on a horse of his own , however , and he drifted in and out of consciousness often in the days which followed . Even when he was awake , swaying groggily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head throbbed and his broken ribs burned with every breath and jolt . Some/times , the very effort of trying to focus on the world around him made him pass out . Unconsciousness was something of a blessing initially , for there was no part of his anatomy which did not hurt . He could not fall off his horse , for his feet were bound to his stirrups and lashed beneath the animal 's belly , but whenever he fainted , which was all too often , his already batteredbody sagged limply against the ropes and strained tortured muscles anew . But his head was the worst . As often as not , when they roused him from one of their infrequent rest stops and made him stand , he passed out again . No matter how he reckoned that , it meant a serious concussion  --  for which the only cure was rest . And so long as his captors continued to press onward toward their unknown destination , he knew he would simply have to endure . In such manner did the days pass  --  four since his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned the identity of the men his captors escorted , but that was hardly more reassuring than his condition . That the notorious Archbishop Loris had somehow managed to escape his sea-girt prison was chilling . He wondered whether Kelson knew . He suspected Loris ' escape somehow had to do with the Mearan question Kelson had been worrying about , but he could not seem to put it all together . His head started aching anew everytime he tried to think about it . He worried about his head and about Loris as they rode through the snow on that fourth day . The first snowstorm of the season had swept down upon them with the morning 's first light , and he shivered with the cold of it , despite the extra mantle they had wrapped around him . Exhaustedand bordering on delirium , wrists chafed raw from days of riding with his hands tied in front of him , he laced his fingers in his horse 's mane and concentrated on staying conscious as they seemed to float in a sphere of silence through the still-falling snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head far enough to see why , they were approaching the ghostly blackness of city gates . He thought it was Culdi at first , for the guards who admitted them wore the Bishop of Culdi 's livery . But even as he thought it , he realized it could not be Culdi . Culdi was loyal to Kelson ; Loris would never go there . They had ridden west and south . He decided it might be Ratharkin . They rode for what seemed like hours through the silent streets , pullingup at last in a darkened courtyard where he was unceremoniously hauled from his horse and half-dragged , half-carried inside a formidablelookingstone building . Being supported under his arms put excruciatingp99pressure on his cracked ribs , but worse by far was the jolting of his head . He passed out as they manhandled him down a narrow , ill-lit stair . The next thing he knew was the warmth of a fire not far away and the play of firelight on his closed eyelids . He lay curled on his left side with his bound hands partially shielding his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur lining of his cloak . Voices buzzed low in the background , occasionally discernable as words and phrases , punctuated by the muted clank of men disarming and the snap of mantles being shaken out . He caught the scent of mulled wine behind him , but the sound of others arriving warned him to feign continued unconsciousness . Cautiouslyhe eased his eyes open to the merest slits to see two men in clerical attire entering the room . The elder he recognized as Creoda , Bishop of Culdi . " Your Excellency , " Creoda murmured , bowing to kiss Loris ' ring . " Welcome to Ratharkin . May I present Father Judhael of Meara , whose family is responsible for arranging your escape . " As Creoda stepped aside , a younger man with silver hair came forward to bend in homage before the renegade archbishop , remaining on one knee when he looked up and Loris did not release his hand . " So , Father , " Loris said , " I see I must thank you for my freedom . " " In truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible , Excellency , " Judhael replied , gazing up at him raptly . " My Lord Creoda felt it wisest if I knew none of the details of my family 's involvement . Apparently that was a wise precaution . When General Morgan questioned me about the attempt on Duncan McLain 's life last week , I was honestly able to say that I knew nothing . ' T is said the Deryni can make a man speak the truth whether he will nor no . " " The Deryni . Aye . " Loris ' eyes took on a dangerous , preoccupied glint . " They also say the traitor archbishops plan to make McLain a bishop at Eastertide . A Deryni bishop ! Blasphemy ! Blasphemy ! " " Yes , Excellency , " Judhael murmured meekly . His tone seemed to remind Loris where he was , and the archbishop 's expression softened as he looked down at Judhael again and smiled , raisinghim to his feet . " But , more of the Deryni and their accursed race later . ' T is also said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you intend to stand for that ? " Judhael looked a little taken aback . " I am not certain I have any say in the matter , Excellency . I am eager to serve , of course , but Henry Istelyn now holds the See of Meara directly from Archbishop Bradene and the king . What of him ? "  | " What of him ? " Loris replied . " I am Primate of Gwynedd  --  not Bradene . Are you willing to accept a slightly less pretentious title than Bishop of Meara , to unsettle these dissident bishops who have usurped my position and yours ? " Creoda 's brow furrowed in question . " What title did you have in mind , Excellency ? " " Bishop of Ratharkin , " Loris said . " Because the Meara you know today is not the Meara which will exist when we are finished . We will take back the ancient Mearan lands when I confound the heretic Duncan McLain  --  who shall never enter into his lands as prince and prelate while I breathe  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mearan state , " he finished pointedly . " Does that please you ? " Creoda flushed with pleasure . " A promotion for all of us , my lord . Of course I am pleased . And allegiance to the rightful queen upon the throne of Meara ? " " Perhaps to a queen of far more than only Meara , " Loris said softly . " It is not only in the episcopate that the Deryni taint has cast its pall . " Creoda blanched . " The king ? " " He is Deryni , is he not ? " Dhugal , following their conversation with growing horror , nearly gasped aloud at the implications . It took all his strength simply to close his eyes and force his body not to tense in outrage . The three clerics continued to discuss minor details of the flight to Ratharkin for several minutes , while Dhugal lay there numbly and tried to think what he could do to stop them . The clink of goblets jarred through the buzz of their further discussion , almost directly behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Who is that ? " Judhael asked . " A hostage , " Loris said casually . " My Lord of Trurill tells me he 's the Master of Transha , Clan MacArdry 's heir . You 'll want his support when Transha is reintegrated with Meara . " Dhugal felt hands rolling him face upward , and the pressure on his ribs made him moan and actually black out for just a few seconds. "  --  want him to witness Judhael 's consecration , then , " Creoda was saying , as consciousness returned . " Is he badly injured ? " " Brice ? " Loris called . The Baron of Trurill came away from unbuckling his armor and knelt to peel back one of Dhugal 's eyelids . " He 's no worse than he was , Excellency , " the traitor baron said , pressinghis fingertips to the pulsepoint in Dhugal 's throat . " He has some cracked ribs that nothing could be done about while we rode , and proba/bly a concussion , but you 're mainly seeing exhaustion . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he 's that strong a lad , we 'd better put him in a secure place , had n't we ? " Creoda said . " Gendon , take him to one of the chambers below and have someone tend to him in the morning . I do n't think he 'll be causing anybody any trouble before then . After that , you can see to your men . Excellency , if you and Father Gorony will follow me , please , I 'll show you to quarters where you 'll be secure from prying eyes until we 're ready to confront Bishop Istelyn in the morning . I expect you 're in need of sleep yourselves . " " A few hours will suffice , " Loris said , as they headed out the door . " I wish little delay before informing Istelyn of the error of his ways . Perhaps we can .. . " Dhugal lost the thread of Loris ' words in pain , groaning anew as Gendon and one of Trurill 's knights lifted him between them and began slowly walking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to make his feet move with theirs through the fog of anguish , the pounding in his head , was that Kelson must be informed of what was happening here . But he did not know how he was going to accomplish that.  |p102Thou  art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels.  --  Isaiah 47:13Kelson and his warband swept into Rhemuth the following forenoon on the fringes of a thunderstorm , half-frozen and soaked to the skin despite oiled riding leathers and fur-lined cloaks . Prince Nigel met them in the castle yard , bare-headed and heedless of the rain pelting down , and set his hand urgently on the king 's bridle . The ill tidings he conveyed set a chill on Kelson which had nothing to do with the storm . " Loris ? But that is n't possible . " The words carried to the others of his close circle  --  Morgan and Duncan , Cardiel and Arilan  --  despite the downpour . Young Baron Jodrell was the first to spring from his horse when the others would have sat there dumbly in the rain , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to action . Kelson beckoned his intimates to follow as he dismounted and splashed up the steps to the shelter of the great hall , anger warring with despair . " I expect you 'll want to question the messenger yourself , " Nigel said , handing off Kelson 's sodden cap and gloves to a page and hurrying to keep up . " Yes , but tell me briefly what he said right now , so I 'll be prepared . " He listened tight-lipped as he stalked through the great hall , unclaspinghis wet cloak with one hand while his other fumbled at the buckle of his sword belt . Morgan collected cloak and sword as he shed them , passing them to another page in exchange for a towel which Kelsonused on his dripping face and hair . Nigel left king and company in a small withdrawing chamber while he went to get the messenger . They sought the meager comfort of the fire while they waited , heaping sodden outer garments in a corner and exchanging guarded glances , nop103one wanting to be the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jawed Kelson , removing vambraces and spurs and helping him shinny out of his mail shirt , while Payne and Rory , Nigel 's younger sons , moved among the others with cups of mulled wine . The king stiffened at the approach of footsteps outside the door , hastily drawing a dry robe over his clammy undertunic . " This is Father Bevis , my liege , " Nigel said , ushering in a nervouslookingyoung priest in the sea blue robes of Saint Iveagh 's Fratri Silena " He has been given dispensation from his abbot to speak aloud . " The man had the courage to come forward alone , but he could not bring himself to meet Kelson 's eyes as he knelt at his feet . Glancing at the others to draw them nearer , Kelson wrapped his robe closer and sat with his back to the fire , stretching one leg slightly to the side so Jodrell could pull off a soggy boot . " Be welcome at our court , Father Bevis , " he said formally , " though I fear I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baron Jodrell continues to disarm me while we speak , but I should rather not take a chill  --  especially if , as it seems , my old enemy is once more at large . " The priest 's tonsured head bobbed even lower . " Nay , it is I who must ask to be forgiven , Sire  --  I and my brethren . We have failed you . " His voice was hardly above a whisper despite his dispensation . " We made every effort to keep the Lord Loris secure as you commanded , but he  --  got out . " He looked up fearfully . " Please do not hold us entirely to blame , Sire . Father Abbot says he must have had help from outside . " Morgan , warming his backside to Kelson 's right , snorted contemptuously , but Kelson only shook his head and sighed , bracing himself so Jodrell could pull off his other boot . " Please rise , Father , " he said patiently . " My uncle has told me the gist of your message already . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to ensure the former archbishop 's safe detention . Did you find no trace of him ? " " None , Sire . And an itinerant preacher calling himself Brother Jeroboamwas also missing . We think he may have had some part in it . Archb  --  I mean Father Loris specifically asked that the man be allowed to hear his confession a few days before . We thought he simply had been moved by the man 's preaching . " " Moved right out of Saint Iveagh 's , " Cardiel muttered . But Kelson ignored the remark . " I see . And the escape occurred when ? "  | " Six days ago , Sire  --  the Eve of Saint Andrew 's  --  sometime after Cornpline , we think . " " Saint Andrew 's Eve , " Kelson murmured . " While we were in Ratharkin . That 's been six days , " he added , glancing aside at Morgan . " He could be anywhere . " " Would it were in hell ! " Morgan said bitterly . Kelson sighed again and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest still standing before him . " Ah , thank you for bringing us this news , Father Bevis . We may wish to question you further , but for now you have our leave to wait outside . The pages will show you where . " As his cousins escorted the priest from the room , clearly disappointed to miss what might happen next , Kelson pivoted on his stool to face the fire , waiting while the others found seats . Nigel and the bishops claimed the remaining stools , so Jodrell hunkered down on the edge of the raised hearth . Duncan chose to remain standing , his arms folded across his chest as he leaned against the wall to the left of the fireplace . Morgan , too restless to sit or stand , paced a short , fidgeting path between Duncan and the king . " Very well , gentlemen . Any ideas where Loris might be headed ? " Kelsonasked . Cardiel pursed his lips and exchanged a glance with his brother bishop , who had not yet said a word . " Toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can not have acted alone in this  --  and all Gwynedd knows and understands why he was relieved of his office and sent to Saint Iveagh 's . That means his help must surely come from outside Gwynedd . Two possibilities come to mind immediately : Meara or Torenth . " " Not Torenth , " Arilan said . " Not while Deryni hold the Torenthi throne . " " Meara , then , " Cardiel said , when Arilan did not go on . " The implications , while quite different , are hardly more reassuring , however . " " How so ? " Kelson asked . " Secular and ecclesiastical politics are very closely intertwined in Meara , Sire , as we are all aware . Loris is very much a political creature . He has always found his support among the conservative clergy  --  and such clergy were very much involved in the dispute over who should be Bishop of Meara . He garners support from rebel factions as well . Two years ago , it was Warin de Grey : today  --  well , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plans to regain his position , I should think Edmund Loris would support just about anyone . "  | " A sad commentary on the man who once was Primate of All Gwynedd , " Duncan muttered . " Let 's talk about Meara , then , " Kelson said . " Who in Meara might profit from Loris ' release ? " " That 's simple , " Nigel said . " The Mearan Pretender and her kin . " " Especially ecclesiastical kin , " Cardiel agreed , glancing at Arilan , who still was oddly quiet . " Like Judhael . Denis and I had quite a discussion about him after the attempt on Duncan , Sire . My brother in Christ made light of my notion that Judhael might have been functioning as an agent for his aunt . " Morgan , noting Arilan 's sullen expression , decided he had best reveal what he had learned . " He 's innocent of that , at least , Excellency , " he said quietly . " Or if he is involved , it 's without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he know anything about the attempt on Duncan . I  --  ah  --  questionedhim about it that evening . " Arilan 's reaction conveyed both surprise and anger . " You questioned him after I forbade it ? " " I did n't set out to disobey you , " Morgan countered , before the other could raise more specific objections in front of the human Jodrell .. " Besides , I only Truth-Read him . He was n't sorry to hear about the attack  --  which is hardly unexpected , given Duncan 's position relative to the Mearan royal house  --  but he was shocked . When I asked how long it had been since he 'd heard from his aunt , he said last Christmastide . I ended the conversation after that . " " A conversation you should not have begun in the first place . " " But one which does not rule out Judhael 's political interests in all of this , " Cardiel interjected . " Denis , you surely ca n't still believe he 's totally innocent . " Arilan 's lips compressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was totally innocent . " " Let 's not wander off the subject , " Kelson said patiently . " Just now , I 'm far more concerned that Loris may , indeed , have gone to Meara . Uncle , you said the abbot 's men found no trace of him in the surrounding countryside , did n't you ? " Nigel nodded . " That may mean he made his escape by sea , then . Jodrell , could he sail around the head of Ballymar this time of year ? " Jodrell , scion of an old seafaring family , wobbled his open hand in a yea-nay gesture . " It would be risky , Sire  --  but no more risky than sailing the Kheldish coast to reach Torenth by sea . If he is making for Meara , however , myp106guess is that he 'd not go as far as Ballymar . If I were Loris , I 'd land somewhere farther east along the coast , probably in Kierney , and go overland to Ratharkin . " " Why Ratharkin ? " Morgan asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , but Ratharkin is the episcopal seat of Meara , " Cardiel said , glancing at Arilan and almost daring him to contradict , " and the good Father Judhael is there , just aching to be a bishop . In addition , Ratharkin is only a few days ' ride from Laas and the rebel factions , even in the dead of winter  --  but more than a week 's ride for us . Oh , he 's picked his ground wisely , if he 's gone to Ratharkin , " he finished bitterly . " The Devil take him for a false and forsworn knave ! " With a dour scowl , Kelson set his balled fists on his thighs and sighed . He was not sure he liked the apparent enmity building between the two bishops . Nor did he understand the reason for it . " This is getting us nowhere , gentlemen , " he said briskly . " Speculation is cheap . God knows I fear Loris ' intentions as much as any of you , but unless we have some direction , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's tried to round Cassan , nature may solve our problem for us . The same applies if , by some odd chance , he 's headed for Torenth after all . " " I doubt that , " Nigel said . " My instinct says Meara  --  not that we necessarily know he 's gone by sea , however . But whether by sea or by land , someone is going to see him and report to us eventually . Loris is too proud a man to hide for long . " " What about Bishop Istelyn ? " Duncan asked . " Should n't he be warned ? If Loris is headed for Meara , Istelyn could be in great danger . " " You 're right , of course , " Kelson agreed . " Uncle , will you see to it ? I think it might also be wise to have Archbishop Bradene join us  --  and any other of the loyal bishops you think should be involved , my Lord Cardiel . Once Loris ' intentions are known , it 's vital that we present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the confusion which marked the beginning of our last campaign against him . " Cardiel inclined his head in agreement . " It shall be done , Sire . " Kelson sighed and rose . " Very well . Loris has to surface sometime  --  and until we hear where , I do n't suppose there 's much else we can do for now . Uncle , please let me know as soon as you learn anything else . Meanwhile , I 'm for a hot bath and some dry clothes . Morgan , Father Duncan , would you please attend me ? " The king said little while his bath was drawn , leading Duncan to wonder why they had been asked to come along , but Morgan suspected hep107knew . His suspicions were confirmed when the three of them sat down before the fireplace in Kelson 's bedchamber . Kelson yawned and stretched , propping his slippered feet nearer the fire 's warmth , and sipped at a warm posset of milk and honey his squire had left . " So , what 's the matter with Arilan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as sullen as a schoolboy who 's been caught in a lie . And do n't tell me it was just because you disobeyed him . " Morgan smiled . " He 's angry with me because I questioned Judhael against his orders , yes . But he is also angry with himself because he championed Judhael 's innocence  --  or at least he played the Devil 's advocatein telling Cardiel and me why we ought not to suspect Judhael in the attempt on Duncan 's life . And maybe he 's right . But if he is n't , then the powerful and somewhat self-superior Camberian Councillor has made a grave misjudgment of a human 's character  --  and he especially does n't like having that pointed out by a mere Deryni half-breed . " " Do you think he 's right ? " Kelson asked . " Or has Judhael played us false ? I swear I 'll crush him , if he has . I do n't need anyone stirring up trouble when Loris is on the loose . And if he helped Loris , then God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan said , " if he 's guilty . But if he had n't any part in the attack on me , Alaric , and if he has n't been in contact with Caitrin- " " He still would have been glad to see you dead , " Morgan interrupted , leaning forward to put another log on the fire . " And simply because he had no literal knowledge of the attack and had n't heard personally from his aunt does n't mean he is n't involved up to his ears . That 's one of the limitations of mere Truth-Reading : one has to ask the right questions . " Kelson pursed his lips . " Then you think Judhael is involved ? " " I do n't know . Someone certainly could have been working in his behalf , though . And Loris  --  " " Damn Loris , " Kelson muttered under his breath . " And damn the circumstances that let him escape . It all connects , Alaric , I 'm sure of it ! He 's planning something terrible . I can feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm as jumpy as a page listening to ghost stories at midnight . I knew I should have had him executed ! " As he drained his cup and sat back to stare moodily into the fire , fingertips drumming vexedly against the chair arm , Morgan exchanged a concerned glance with Duncan . Casually his cousin rose and came around behind the king , beginning to massage Kelson 's tense shoulders . Kelson sighed appreciatively and closed his eyes , making a conscious effort to relax.  | " That feels wonderful , " he said after a moment . " I had n't realized how tired I was . Do n't stop . " " We 're all exhausted , " Duncan said easily , reaching out a little with his mind as his fingers continued to knead at steel-taut muscles . " Do n't let your righteous anger tie you into knots , though . " " If I 'd killed Loris while I had the chance , I would n't have to worry about getting tied in knots , " Kelson said dreamily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better . I 'll grant that if you had killed him , things certainly would be easier now . " Kelson yawned hugely and relaxed even more against Duncan 's touch , mental as well as physical , tipping his head back to loll against the priest 's chest and glance up . " You are n't supposed to agree so readily , " he murmured . " I 'm sitting here contemplating murder . What kind of a conscience are you , anyway ? If Loris has a conscience like you , I do n't wonder that he strayed . " Kelson turned his gaze toward Morgan . " What do you suppose did make him stray ? " " Pride , " Morgan replied . " The belief that his notion of truth was somehow superior to anyone else 's . " " So he sold his honor to serve his pride . " " It 's said that every man has his price , my prince , " Morgan said . " Some are simply too high to be met . " " And is yours that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministrations , but Morgan merely smiled . " High enough that no man could ever pay it but you , my prince , " he replied without hesitation . " I am your man , as I was your father 's before you . You have bought me with your love . Nor can I ever be resold . " Chuckling delightedly , Kelson yawned and closed his eyes once more , aware that Duncan was urging sleep on him and not fighting it . " You always know the right thing to say , do n't you ? Here . " Kelson handed his empty cup to Morgan . " And Duncan , you need n't nag ; I was planning all along to have a nap . " " That 's one of the more reasonable things you 've said all day , " Duncan replied . " You ought to go lie down in your bed , however . You 'll get a crick in your neck if you fall asleep here . " " Nag , nag , nag , " Kelson whispered around another yawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow . Duncan pulled a fur coverlet more snugly around him and closed the bed curtains , then returned to the chair the king had just vacated.  | " He 's in quite a mood , " Morgan observed . " Anything we should worry about ? " " I do n't think so . He 's just tired . And shocked far more than he wants to admit , over Loris ' escape . What do you think he 's up to , Alaric ? " " Loris ? " Morgan shook his head and glanced into the dying flames . " Damned if I know . As Kelson said not long ago , however  --  something terrible . " " And Judhael ? " " The same , I fear . " Even as Morgan and Duncan spoke , Loris was making good their suspicions in Ratharkin . Bishop Istelyn , after celebrating the noon Mass , was seized by armed men wearing the livery of the Bishop of Culdi and , still vested , was conducted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar . A third man wearing the same episcopal purple as Creoda knelt close by the altar steps with his back to Istelyn , who could not see his face . Something in the line of the shoulders and bowed head struck a chord of both familiarity and danger . " What is the meaning of this ? " Istelyn demanded , approaching the three as the guards released him and withdrew . Creoda and Judhael moved diffidently to either side as the stranger rose and turned . " Hello , Henry , " the stranger said . Istelyn froze in the center of the aisle and blanched nearly as white as his alb . " Loris ! " The renegade archbishop folded his hands complacently across his narrow waist and gave a thin smile . " Why , Henry , you seem surprised , " he said softly . " But I would have thought that after so many years in Orders , you would know better how to greet your Primate . " " Primate ? " Istelyn 's jaw dropped . " You must be mad ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iveagh 's , the last I heard . " " Obviously , I am no longer at Saint Iveagh 's , " Loris said in a low , dangerous voice . " Nor was I pleased at my accommodations there  --  accommodations which you had a part in forcing upon me . " For the first time , the true danger of Istelyn 's situation registered . Calling for the guard would do no good , for the men " loaned " him by his supposed benefactor , Creoda , were the same who had brought him here . Nor was Judhael 's presence reassuring . The Mearan priest who hadp110sought the office which Istelyn now held would have no reason to championhis former rival . He was totally in their power , with no way to summon help or even to distinguish whose help could be trusted . He supposed that the men left by Bradene were still loyal , but they were probably under guard by now as well . He hoped they had not been harmed . And Loris ' reference to himself as Primate bespoke a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his exaction of vengeance against a man who had helped to unseat him from his previous glory . " What do you want of me ? " Istelyn said carefully . " Your pretense to the Primacy is treasonous and your very presence in Ratharkin illegal . And Creoda  --  " He shifted his gaze to the betraying bishop . " You and Father Judhael also tread on extremely dangerous ground if you harbor this man . Was all your offer of assistance merely a sham to gain my confidence until this fugitive could join you in your betrayal of Mother Church ? " Judhael said nothing , though his jaw tightened in resentment , but Creodasmiled pleasantly and inclined his head . " We perceive no betrayal of Mother Church , " he said amiably . " Rather , we perceive the actions of the consistory and the king as a betrayal of the Mearan people . Father Judhael should have been bishop here  --  not you . It 's as simple as that . And Archbishop Loris ought never to have been relieved of his office and imprisoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to rectify the error , Henry . " " What error ? " Istelyn demanded . " His own brother bishops pronouncedjudgment on him , Creoda . You were there . Nor do I recollect any outbursts of righteous indignation on your part at the time . " Creoda raised an unconcerned eyebrow . " I was ill-informed . " " You mean you 've since been bought ! What did he offer you , Creoda ? You 're Bishop of Culdi , for God 's sake ! What could a disgraced archbishoppossibly have offered you that was better than that ? " " You would do well to remember who and where you are , Bishop , " Loris said pointedly . " And you will either cooperate or pay the price reserved for traitors . We shall begin with Meara : the seating of a Mearan priest upon an episcopal throne in Meara , the restoration of the legitimateMearan royal line , and the extension of Meara 's borders to her previous boundaries . Meara shall be an independent princedom once more , with her own ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Istelyn . " Yes , headed by myself And then we shall cleanse error from the land in Meara and eventually in Gwynedd and the rest of the Eleven King/doms . Deryni heresy has corrupted even the mighty . It must be obliterated . This time , we shall not fail . " " But , the king is part Deryni , " Istelyn murmured . " A crown does not confer immunity from the just wrath of an offended God ! " Loris thundered , drawing himself to self-righteous attention . " The king has erred ; the king must be chastised . If it would change the past , I would strike off my own hand which poured the sacred oil upon his head ! His error must be burned from him , even unto death , if necessary , for the sake of his immortal soul ! The Lord 's trust has been betrayed . The Lord will repay ! " " He 's gone mad , " Istelyn murmured under his breath , shaking his head as he turned half away . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustle of episcopal silk coming nearer and glanced back to see Loris almost within reach of him , Creoda and Judhael flanking him to either side . " I give you one chance and one chance only for clemency , " Loris said , raising a single finger to illustrate his point . " If you will assist Creoda and myself in consecrating Father Judhael a bishop , I shall permit you the same kind of honorable retirement ' to which you so generously consignedme for the past two years . It is more than you deserve . " " And all I must do to be granted this magnanimous favor is betray my archbishop and my king by raising a traitor in my stead , " Istelyn said . " I decline the honor . " " I should not be too hasty , if I were you , " Loris warned . " Do not let misplaced loyalties lead you to your death . " " Do not threaten me ! " Istelyn snapped . " I 'll not turn traitor for offices or riches or even to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist your illegal consecration of that man . " " I beg of you , Henry , be reasonable , " Creoda said . " Oh , I am . I 'm being quite reasonable . And it occurs to me that there 's only one reason you 'd be courting my assistance to consecrate your Mearan traitor . You need another bishop 's hands to make it valid , do n't you ? " Eyes narrowed and dangerous , Loris slowly shook his head . " There is nothing I need from you , Istelyn . Judhael shall have his sacring whether you will it or no . " " Not by my hand . " " If defiance gives you comfort , then so be it , " Loris replied . " But do not make the mistake of thinking that your refusal will make it impossible to consecrate Judhael . Surely you do not think I would embark upon this holy crusade if I did not have further support among the episcopatep112of a reunited Meara ? The Bishop of Cashien and two itinerant bishops are within Ratharkin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive with the Lady Caitrin 's party within a few days  --  so we will have twice the number needed to make Judhael 's consecration valid . " " Twice the number of traitors , " Istelyn countered . Loris ' eyes narrowed . " You are as stiff-necked as ever , Istelyn . I believe I am becoming bored with this conversation . Judhael , ask the guards to come in , please . Father Istelyn will be going to his new quarters now . " " In the dungeons ? " Istelyn asked , as Judhael bowed and moved past him to obey . Loris returned him a prim smile . " I am not a man wholly lacking of a sense of propriety , Henry . Out of respect for the office you still technicallyhold , you shall be detained in reasonable comfort until after Judhael 's consecration as bishop . " He signed to the entering guards to wait just inside the doors . " For the sake of propriety , however , I shall require that you remove your vestments before going to your new quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you decide to resist your escort . " The mere suggestion that guards might lay hands upon him while still vested for the altar sent a chill up Istelyn 's spine , but he knew the threat was not an idle one . Loris ' hard eyes had convinced him early on that there would be no quarter , even had he agreed to terms . Slowly he removed the violet chasuble with its somber symbols of Advent and laid it across the waiting arms of Judhael , followed by maniple , cincture , stole , amice , and alb . Finally he stood before them clad only in the violet cassock , slippers , and skullcap of a bishop , clasping the jewelled pectoral cross on his breast in silent affirmation of his continued defiance . A guard came from behind and laid a fur-lined cloak around his shoulders , and Istelyn nodded surprised thanks as he drew it around himself against the cold . " Bishop Istelyn is to lodge temporarily with the young Master of Transha , " Loris told the guard captain . " Please escort him there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive no visitors . He has our leave to celebrate Mass privately and to minister to the boy , and may have what he needs for either intention . You may go now . " The guards started toward him , but Istelyn ignored them to shoulder numbly past Loris and Creoda and make a reverent obeisance before the altar . He wore his dignity like a mantle as he rose and went to his captors , even though he was sick with fear inside , but the guards responded to the outward nobility of the man and fell into step as a true escort rather than a custodial force . He managed not to start shakingp113until they had closed the door of his prison chamber behind him . He did not know how long he stood there with his back against the door , tremblingand fighting down the nausea of defeat , until gradually he became aware of eyes watching him from the shadows of a fur-covered pallet near the pleasant fire . " Who 's there ? " he called softly . " Forgive me for not rising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but my ribs hurt me if I move too much . You must be Bishop Istelyn . " " I am . " Cautiously Istelyn moved closer . The boyish face the firelight revealed was far younger than he had been expecting . Below a greyish bandage tied around the boy 's forehead , tawny eyes gazed up at him with disconcertingdirectness , though a reddish smudge of mustache marked him as a little older than Istelyn had first thought  --  perhaps fourteen or fifteen . Dark circles stained the fair skin underneath the eyes . It was evident the lad had lived with pain for some time . " You must be the young Master of Transha , " Istelyn said , crouching down beside the pallet . " Almost the late Master of Transha , thanks to Loris ' escort , " the boy replied , offering a hand from underneath his sleeping furs and essaying a tentative smile . " I 'm called Dhugal by my friends . This hardly seems the place for overmuch formality . " Istelyn took the extended hand briefly and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young laird , since we seem to be destined at least to be colleagues . Did they hurt you very badly ? " " The horses hurt me about as much as the men , I suppose , " Dhugal admitted , settling back against his mound of pillows with a barely bittenbackgrimace . " After I got knocked off my pony , I was kicked a couple of times and nearly trampled . The men only hit me in the head . I 've some cracked ribs , but at least the headaches seem to be letting up . What day is it ? " " The fifth of December , " Istelyn responded . " We 're in Advent season . Shall I look at your injuries ? I have n't much skill in such matters , but perhaps I can do something . " Dhugal closed his eyes briefly and managed a slight nod . " Thank you . I can tell you what to do . I 've had training as a battle surgeon myself , but there 's only so much one can do on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the worst just now . " Dhugal was nude beneath the sleeping furs , his slender torso and limbs displaying the number of old scars one might expect of a lad trained inp114warrior disciplines , but Istelyn sucked in breath between his teeth at the massive bruising across the left ribcage . Another bruise purpled the top of the right thigh in the precise outline of a horseshoe . Istelyn could even see the prints of the nails which had held the shoe in place . " That one looks much worse than it is , " Dhugal said , brushing the bruise lightly with his right hand . " Which is not to say it does n't hurt , or that I wo n't limp for a while , but at least I did n't break my leg . If they 'll give you bandages , or if something can be improvised , I need you to bind my chest . Without support , even breathing can be an agony if I move the wrong way . And coughing  --  " As Dhugal braced both hands over his ribcage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have n't punctured a lung , have you ? " Dhugal shook his head and winced as he pulled the furs back up to his waist . " I do n't think so . I 'm not coughing blood . I 'd give a lot for a good night 's sleep , though . " " Loris said I might have medical supplies , " Istelyn said . " Perhaps they 'll have something to help you sleep . What about your head ? Any actual wounds ? " Dhugal flinched as the bishop pulled the bandage from his head and began probing gently beneath the reddish hair . " No  --  and I do n't think I 've missed any fractures . It 's just the headaches , and they 're letting up . " " All right . " Istelyn managed a shaky smile as he rose and glanced apprehensively at the door . " Let 's see whether Loris meant what he said about medical supplies . " An hour later , bundled in a cloak against the cold , Dhugal was sitting gingerly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had since before his capture . So long as he did not breathe too deeply , the bandages Istelyn had bound around his chest gave him enough support so that his ribs no longer hurt beyond a dull ache  --  and that was fast receding as he sipped at the cup of wine he had directed Istelyn to prepare . " This should make me sleep at least through the night , " he told the bishop , as he took another swallow of the drugged wine and let the bitter undertaste roll over the back of his tongue . " If they 'll let you have more , I want you to keep me sedated for at least another day and night beyond that . I do n't like leaving myself so vulnerable , but unfortunately sleep and rest are still the best treatments I know for head injuries like mine . " He sighed dismally . " It 's too bad Kelson is n't here . He could  --  " He broke off and glanced at the bishop furtively as he realized what hep115had almost said , afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might offend the human Istelyn . To his horror , Istelyn seemed to know exactly what he had been about to say . " He could do what ? " the bishop asked . " Help you in some way with his magic ? " Dhugal swallowed audibly , trying to stay on guard . The drug was loosening his tongue as well as damping the pain . Istelyn seemed trustworthy , but this was hardly the time to begin so controversial a discussionwith a man whose sympathies were unknown . " I  --  do n't want to offend you , Excellency , but most clergy are n't altogethertolerant of  --  ah  --  magic . Please forget I said anything . " " Ah , then his magic frightens you . " " I  --  I 'd rather not talk about it , " Dhugal whispered , feeling trapped . Istelyn cocked his head , then glanced back at the closed door before leaning closer to Dhugal . " Why not ? " he asked . " You spoke of the king with affection and familiarity , as if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his  --  ah  --  let 's call them talents , ' if you do n't like the term magic , ' shall we ? " " It is n't that , " Dhugal murmured . " Is it that you are n't sure of me , then ? " Istelyn persisted . " You 've already trusted me with your life . " " That trust is mine to give ; Kelson 's is n't . " " I can appreciate that . " The bishop 's eyes did not leave Dhugal 's as he sipped at his wine  --  which made Dhugal increasingly anxious  --  but after a few seconds the man sighed and gave a tiny smile , raising his cup in resigned salute . " I do n't blame you for trying to shield the king , son , but why do n't you let me tell you how I feel about him ? I ca n't prove that I 'm telling the truth , but you 're smart enough to judge for yourself . I was n't present at Dhassa when Loris and the rebel bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king as soon as I learned of it . I was with his army at Dol Shaia . It was I who had to bring him the news that Loris had excommunicatedhim and placed the kingdom under Interdict . " He sighed again , then went on . " Now I 've put myself on the line again where His Majesty is concerned . Loris wants me to help him consecrate Judhael of Meara a bishop . I 've refused , and he 'll probably kill me for it . I swear by all I hold sacred that I 'm not lying , Dhugal . I do n't care that the king 's Deryni  --  not the way Loris does , at any rate . It seems to me that Kelson 's done only good with his powers . Or are you going to try to tell me differently ? "  | " Of course not . " Dhugal looked away into the flickering flames and made himself take another swallow of the drugged wine , even though he knew it would make him only more vulnerable to the bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bishop were no better than the others ensconced here at Ratharkin , it could do little further harm to Kelson 's already checquered reputation for Dhugal to report that he had seen the king put an injured man to sleep with magic . Far worse had been alleged in the past two years , and by far more important people than a fifteen-year-old border lord . " About a fortnight ago , Kelson rode out from Culdi to pay a surprise visit on one of his local barons , " Dhugal said carefully . " It was Brice of Trurill . Trurill borders on Transha lands , so I was riding with a Trurill patrol . " He grimaced . " That 's another story . Those same men , including the baron himself , were the escort that met Loris when he landed on the coast near my father 's castle , hardly a week later . They 're probably still here in Ratharkin . " " Brice of Trurill supports Loris ? " Istelyn sounded genuinely surprised and shocked , which reassured Dhugal . " Aye . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audacity to hold a blade to my throat . " At Istelyn 's low whistle under his breath , Dhugal took another pull at his wine , making a face at the increasingly bitter taste as he got closer to the bottom . He could feel himself becoming more and more detached as the drug gently entered his system . " Anyway , when the king met us a fortnight ago , we were in the middle of routing a band of brigands who 'd been stealing sheep . " He paused to yawn . " Afterward , it was my job to patch up the wounded . One of our lads was in a pretty bad way . Kelson  --  put him to sleep so I could work on him . It was like a miracle . " Istelyn 's eyes had grown as round as the moon at full . " Did he heal him , then ? " " No . He only laid his hand on his forehead and made him go to sleep . He says that General Morgan and Father Duncan can heal sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes . " That ca n't be wrong either , can it , Excellency ? " " No , " Istelyn whispered . " No , son , I do n't see how it could be . " The bishop seemed troubled by his question , however , and soon rose to seek the comfort of prayer . Kneeling at a prie-dieu set in one of the window embrasures , he signed himself , then bowed his head in his handsp117and was still . Dhugal stared after him for several minutes , forming a prayer in his own mind that Istelyn was what he appeared , but when he caught himself starting to nod off , he drained the last of his wine and lowered himself gingerly to his pallet once more , grimacing at the bitterness of the dregs . It was becoming harder and harder to concentrate with the full dose of the sedative in him , but as he settled himself under the sleeping furs , he tried to think of ways to better his situation when he awoke . He wonderedvaguely whether Kelson knew yet of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do anything about it . The fate of one man balanced ill against that of an entire realm . But perhaps Dhugal could find a way to help himself , once he had regained some of his strength . That they regarded him as a valuable hostage was apparent , not only from the fact that they had taken him in the first place but from his continued treatment since arriving in Ratharkin . Had his usefulness ended once they were safely out of Transha , they would have cut his throat long ago . He also recalled some reference to wanting his support when they reunited Transha with old Meara  --  an unthinkable defection for one loyal to the king  --  but perhaps that meant that no one was aware of his renewed friendship with Kelson . Nor was anyone likely to connect the young Master of Transha with the then second son of Transha 's chief who had served at King Brion 's court as a page . Also in Dhugal 's favor was his boyish appearance . Given anything approaching luck , he thought he might play on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pliable as he looked  --  a mistake even Istelyn had made at first . It was a dangerous game , but if he could play it well , he might mislead them enough to lower their guard . Then he could escape to warn Kelson . He was thinking of ways that might be accomplished as he finally abandoned himself to sleep . Unexpectedly , he dreamed not of Kelson but of his father , and a lone MacArdry piper skirling a lament atop a snowcoveredhill.  |p118But  thou , mastering thy power , judgest withequity , and orderest us with great favor : for thou mayest use power when thou wilt.  --  Wisdom of Solomon 12:18Ciard 0 Ruane , the advance messenger from Clan MacArdry , arrived in Rhemuth late the following afternoon , stunning the court with his doubly woeful news . " The young laird does nae know about his father , m'lord , " the man concluded , nodding exhausted thanks to a young page who handed him a full tankard . " That 's assuming he 's still alive himself , of course . " The intimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kelson . Before that instant , he had not allowed himself even to consider the possibility . Shuttering down the shadow of fear that flickered at the back of his eyes , the king glanced to Morgan and Duncan for reassurance , his fingers tightening viselike on the arms of his throne . " He has to be alive , " he murmured , almost to himself . " I know he is ! Ciard , you 're sure it was Trurill 's men who took him ? " The gillie gave a deprecating flourish with one hand as he took a long pull at his ale . If his own son had been taken , he could not have been more devastated . " We hae ridden wi ' those men all summer , sair . D'ye think I would nae recognize them ? It were the Laird Brice himself wha ' had my young master o'er his saddlebow . " " And this prisoner that 's coming is a priest ? " " Aye , m'lord . And an impertinent an ' close-mouthed rascal he is , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye ! " " And I 'll wager I can tell you at least one of the things he 'll sing , " Morgan murmured so that only Kelson could hear , as laughter tinged with menace rippled through the chamber . " What 's that ? "  | " That Loris was one of the men Trurill was escorting . Remember , Jodrell told us he 'd land on the coast . " " That is n't funny , Morgan  --  even in jest , " Kelson whispered . " Do you really think I 'd jest about a thing like this ? " Morgan returned . " Watch the priest confirm that it 's Loris . Who else would dare to call you a heretic king ? And if you want my guess , they 're headed for Ratharkin , just as we suspected . It 's on a direct line from Carcashale and the coast where they landed , and the landing itself was a day-and-a-half 's sail from Saint Iveagh 's . " Only the knowledge of the prisoner on the way , surely to arrive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departure for Ratharkin then and there . He was snappish and preoccupied by turns all through dinner , inwardly mourning old Caulay even as he fretted about Caulay 's son , and let his anger build against Loris . " You 're right , it has to be Loris , " he told Morgan later that evening , after Duncan had excused himself to confer with the other bishops and Nigel had retired for some much needed sleep . " I hold him personally to blame for Caulay 's death . And if Dhugal  --  " He would not let himself finish the thought , shaking his head in fierce denial as he leaned both elbows on the mantel and stared down into the crackling fire . Morgan , looking out over Rhemuth 's rain-slick rooftops from a window embrasure , glanced sharply at the king , then returned his gaze to the darkness outside . His breath had misted the blurred grey glass , and he burnished a clear spot with his fingertip to peer outside once more . If it was raining this hard on the Gwynedd plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trurill 's defection hurts , too , " Kelson said after a moment , breaking into Morgan 's more practical introspections . " I was going to visit him  --  I 'm sure I would have seen the signs if I had  --  but I let personalpleasure call me from my duty . I never should have gone to Transha with Dhugal . Now he 's been taken and it 's all my fault . " " It is n't your fault , and if you insist upon blaming yourself , you 're only going to make yourself less effective . What possible difference could your visit have made ? " " I still should have gone to Trurill , " Kelson said stubbornly . " If I had " If you had , there 's no guarantee you would have noticed anything was wrong , " Morgan interrupted . " You may be Deryni , but you are n't omniscient . " " I recognize treason when I see it ! " " From our perspective , yes . On the other hand , I would venture top120guess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , the Mearans regard themselves as a subjugated people . They have since your great-grandfather married the daughter of the last Mearan prince . If Loris has found supporters in Meara , I suspect it 's because he 's told them they 're crusaders in the cause of a free Meara . " " A free Meara ? " Kelson 's savage kick at the nearest log on the fire produced a shower of sparks . " Free Meara indeed ! Meara has never been free ! Before my great-grandfather wed the silly Mearan heiress whose marriage was supposed to resolve all of this , Meara had been ruled by petty warlords and despots for centuries . Before that , it was no more civilized than The Connait . " " The Connait , whose warriors are among the most prized mercenaries in the known world ? " Morgan asked . Scowling , Kelson retreated from the fire and stalked across the room to join Morgan in the window embrasure . " You know what I mean . Do n't confuse me with fine points of distinc-tion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , my prince , " Morganreplied patiently . " The point is  --  " " The point is that Loris is in Meara , stirring up dissention  --  maybe even spearheading a civil rebellion , for all we know  --  and winter is setting in and there is n't a bloody lot I can do about it until the spring . " " There is also the point that Loris has one of your closest friends to hostage , " Morgan said softly . " And you would be far less the man I have come to love and respect if you were not deeply concerned over his fate . " Kelson lowered his eyes , the gentle rebuke well taken . " He really is like a brother , Alaric , " he said softly . " He 's far closer than my cousins . He 's  --  almost as close as you , if you were my age  --  or Duncan . He even --  " As he broke off and drew cautious breath , shifting his unfocused gaze to the fogged window between them , Morgan raised an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Dhugal , " the king murmured . " Sweet Jesu , I 'd forgotten to mention it to you . " He glanced at Morgan sheepishly . " Do you remember that night you contacted me in Transha , and how I had to break off suddenly because Dhugal was panicking ? " " Of course . " " Well , it was n't wholly my idea . Dhugal pushed us out of the link  --  with shields . " " Shields ? But that 's impossible . He is n't Deryni. "  | " Then what is he ? " Kelson countered . " He 's certainly got shields a lot like ours . He ca n't lower them , though . " " He ca n't  --  " Morgan broke off and forced himself to take a deep , steadying breath , putting out of mind the increased danger to Dhugal if he were Deryni and in Loris ' hands , and Loris found out . " He has shields , but he ca n't lower them , " Morgan repeated more calmly , glancing back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to read him . I could n't get through . All I did was give him a demon of a headache . And it hurt him , Alaric . It is n't supposed to hurt . " " No , it is n't , " Morgan murmured . After a few seconds , he shook his head and set his hands on Kelson 's shoulders . " I want you to show me exactly what you did and saw and felt , " he said . " Do n't hold back a thing , even the pain . This could be very impor-tant , " Breathing out with a sigh , Kelson let his hands fall to his sides and closed his eyes , willing the familiar channels to open . He would not have thought of arguing . Morgan 's touch on his forehead plunged him at once into rapport , the link unclouded by any separation of miles or differences of intent . He took Morgan at his word and sent the undiluted memory surging across the link in the space of a few heartbeats , not letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan looked a little dazed even after he withdrew . " I do n't think I 've ever felt anything like that , " Morgan murmured , focusing with an effort . " I still do n't understand . You should have been able to read him . " " Maybe he has something like my Haldane gifts , " said Kelson . " Some potential for Derynilike abilities . Or maybe he 's like Warin de Grey . " Morgan shook his head , voicing his thoughts aloud as he wandered in the direction of the fireplace . " No , his shields have a . . . a flavor , for want of a better word , that 's quite different from Warin , who has shields and can even heal , but definitelyis n't one of us . " " Then , maybe he 's fey , " Kelson quipped , biting back a chuckle . " He said he was  --  Dhugal , I mean . He says hill people have the Second Sight  --  whatever that is . " He paused a beat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strain had come into his family several generations ago  --  perhaps during the worst of the persecutions  --  might n't there be descendantswho had no idea what they were , whose occasional odd quirks of talent were simply explained as Second Sight , ' or fey ' ? My mother did n't know , after all . "  | " That 's what she said , " Morgan replied . " I 'm sure she at least suspected , however . And there was certainly no doubt in my mind what she was , when I threatened to read her and she backed off . But nothing in your contact with Dhugal points to anything but shields . " He sighed . " I wish I could give you better answers . I suppose that 's one of the disadvantagesof getting one 's training in bits and snippets the way Duncan and I did . Arilan might know better what to do , but  --  " " But you do n't wholly trust him , " Kelson finished . Morgan shrugged . " You 've seen his attitude . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone on between us , he never lets go of the fact that Duncan and I are only half Deryni . Maybe his precious Camberian Council wo n't let him forget it  --  though he seems to set that aside in your case . " " They see me in a different You mean you 've had contact with them ? " Morgan asked , surprised . " Not with the Council as a whole , but individuals have made overtures . " The king lowered his eyes . " It is n't for me to say anything furtheryet . Please do n't press me for details . " Morgan longed to do just that , for this was the first he 'd heard of any such contact , but he forced himself to push curiosity aside and instead flung himself down in a chair beside the fire . If the Council had been making overtures , if only to Kelson , that was a positive step for them . Hemust do nothing to jeopardize the possible dialogue . " Very well . I sha n't belabor the issue . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard , at any rate . " Kelson nodded idly , leaning both hands against one of the finials on the back of Morgan 's chair . From his expression , Morgan wondered whether he 'd heard a word he 'd said . " Morgan , have you ever done any scrying ? " the king asked after a few more seconds . " What do you want to scry for ? " " Dhugal , of course . Have you ? " " In a manner of speaking . I 've worked visualizations using a shiral crystal , though I doubt that 's quite the same . One usually needs somethingbelonging to the person one wants to scry about . Do you have something of Dhugal 's ? " " Not really  --  wait a moment . Yes , I do . " He went to a small casket set on a table beside his bed and rummaged inside for several seconds , finally returning with a short length of blacksilk ribbon.  | " I borrowed this when I was at Transha , " the king said , perching on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inspection . " Is it enough ? " " It might be . " Morgan let the ribbon trail across his hand and gave it a tentative probe , but he could detect nothing special about it . " I do n't suppose you have a . chiral crystal ? " Kelson 's face fell . " No , do we need one ? Do n't you have one ? " " Not in Rhemuth . " Morgan sighed . " However , it 's said not to be impossible without one . " He cocked his head at Kelson . " You 're sure you want to do this ? " " Morgan ... " " All right . I ca n't promise any results , though . All you may get out of it is a splitting headache . " " I 'll take that chance . " " And if he 's dead ? " Kelson ducked his head , tight-lipped and all but blinking back tears , and Morgan instantly regretted his bluntness . " I 'm sorry , my prince , " he whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breath and got to his feet . " That was tactless of me . Change places with me and we 'll give it a try . I did n't mean to feed your fears . " Kelson did not look at him as he obeyed , nor did he answer . He sensed Morgan 's awkwardness , and that the Deryni lord understood how frightenedhe really was for Dhugal 's sake . Morgan sat gingerly on the right arm of the chair facing him and took his nearer wrist as soon as he had settled , twining an end of the tightly clutched ribbon through his own fingers . " Let 's use the flames as your first focus , " Morgan said softly , himself locking on the king 's eyes . " Let yourself slip into trance and stare into the fire . I 'll not share your vision , but feel free to pull energy from me as you begin to build an image of Dhugal in the shifting patterns of light and dark . Draw on his essence that remains in the ribbon and start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes unfocus . That 's right . Use the flames as a background for your Vision , but know that the flames themselves are not your goal . See Dhugal as you last saw him , and now bring that image forward in time . Let yourself flow with it . GoodKelson did his best to follow Morgan 's instructions , extending his mind through the length of black silk between his fingers as his eyes gazed at and through the flames , but his own fears hampered his concentration . He could feel the support of Morgan 's power augmenting hisp124own as he sought the captive Dhugal , but he was never sure he made a real contact . His head ached as he came out of trance , and it hurt to breathe . " Nothing , " Morgan guessed , taking the ribbon from his fingers as Kelson forced himself back to equilibrium . Kelson shook his head dispiritedly . " I ca n't tell . I really do think I 'd know if he were dead  --  but I could n't separate out anything else that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiral after all . " " Perhaps . " Despite their failure to locate any tangible clue to Dhugal 's whereabouts , Kelson became convinced in the next hour that Dhugal almost had to be in Ratharkin  --  and with Loris . " And if that 's what 's happened , Istelyn is in danger , too , " Kelson reasoned . " Morgan , we 've got to help them . " " You mean , go to Ratharkin ? " " Well , we might be able to surprise them . How strong can Loris be ? " But reason prevailed where sheer emotion might have won out , for Morgan reminded the king of the prisoner due from Transha , who might be able to shed a great deal more light on the situation . Loris might not have been headed for Ratharkin . Kelson reluctantly agreed to delay any decision until the prisoner arrived and had been questioned , but he slept only fitfully for what remained of the night , despite the rain drumming against the mullioned windows . The rain continued without cease through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early afternoon . At Kelson 's order , the drenched and shivering bordermen who had brought him whiskedtheir prize directly to a private withdrawing chamber , before anyone atfire . " Mind his arm . " The strain of the ride from Transha showed in the prisoner 's every move as he collapsed into the chair before the fire , bracing his bandagedIt forearm against his chest . The man did not protest as Duncan removed his own cloak and laid it around his shivering shoulders , perhaps taking comfort from his benefactor 's priestly garb , but he showed an instant 's panic when Kelson dismissed the guards and Nigel closed the door behind them . The eyes beneath the warrior 's shock of close-cropped hair mirrored suspicion and uncertainty along with physical discomfort. court even got a close look at him Only Morgan Duncan and Nigel were invited to attend the king . " Someone give him a dry cloak , " Kelson said , as the bordermen halfpushedand half-dragged their charge to a chair Kelson indicated by the " I claim benefit of clergy , " he whispered hoarsely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have no authority to try me . " Nelson leaned an arm along the mantel and studied his captive with amixture of curiosity and anticipation . " I do n't intend to try you , " he said . " I simply plan to ask you a few questions . Father Duncan , do you suppose you and Morgan might be able to do something about his injury ? " The two names triggered the expected response  --  Kelson had been fairly certain their prisoner did not know Morgan or Duncan by sight . As Duncan bestirred himself to reach toward the bandaged arm , Morgan approaching from the other side , the man shrank back in his chair . " Stay away ! " He did his best to watch both of them at once and fend off Duncan with his one good hand . " Do n't touch me ! I want no Deryni sorcerers  --  " Before he could decide who was the greater threat , Morgan glided in slightly from behind and clamped the desperately swiveling head between his hands , extending control , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost bored as hands and mind compelled obedience . " It is n't going to do any good . And if you relax and cooperate , we may even be able to make you a little more comfortable . " The man 's struggles subsided jerkily , much against his will , and his free hand fell away as Duncan began unwrapping the splinted arm . He winced as the priest 's sensitive fingers brushed the angry-looking flesh over the broken forearm , his body arching with new pain as Duncan encased the damaged area between his two hands . " What are you doing ? No magic ! No ! Please do n't ! " At Duncan 's nod , Morgan drew his controls tighter and pushed the man into unconsciousness , shifting one hand to cover Duncan 's two as he reached for the healing mode he and his cousin now achieved with increasingreliability . Building the rapport with Duncan , he felt himself sinking into that odd , other-worldly sensation which he had come to associate with the rogue healing talent  --  and felt the fleeting , familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection was made and the bones began to knit beneath their touch . He withdrew when the healing was complete , blinking and partially releasing control to let their patient regain consciousness . " No , " the man murmured weakly , as his eyes fluttered open . " No magic , please ... " " It 's a little late for that , " Morgan replied , settling on a stool thatp126Nigel pushed closer , so he could keep one hand casually on the man 's shoulder for future control . " Suppose you tell us your name now . " Dazed , the man flexed the fingers of his sword arm and rubbed where the break had been , glancing furtively at Duncan , not daring to look at Morgan or acknowledge the Deryni hand still resting on his shoulder . " You  --  healed me , " he whispered reproachfully . " Yes , they healed you , " Kelson replied , looking a little disgusted . " You 're not contaminated , you know . Answer the question . Who are you ? " The man swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said weakly . " I  --  " " The only benefit of clergy that you 're going to receive right now , " Nigel said pointedly , " is the fact that Monsignor McLain is here to witnessyour interrogation . Now answer your king 's question . " As the man set his lips in a thin , defiant line and started to shake his head , Morgan exchanged a glance with Kelson and extended control again , imposing the compulsions of Truth-Saying . " Tell us your name , " he said patiently . " Nevan d'Estrelldas , " the man replied , his eyes widening as the words tumbled from his lips despite his intention to keep silent . " D'Estrelldas ? " Kelson repeated , glancing at Duncan in surprised question as Duncan , too , started . " That 's an unusual name  --  Bremagni , is n't it ? " Duncan nodded , pursing his lips in grim suspicion . " It is also the name of one of the itinerant bishops working in Kierney , is n't it , Nevan ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan scowled even harder . Kelson looked astonished . " You mean this man is one of our bishops ? " " Unfortunately , I fear he is , Sire , " Duncan replied . " I thought he looked familiar . I wonder how many other bishops Loris has managed to subvert . " " Let 's see if he knows , " Morgan said , turning pale eyes on his subject and locking his attention . " You are Bishop Nevan , are you not ? " " Yes . " " Yes , what ? " Morgan insisted , touching further control . Nevan moistened his lips and inclined his head in unwilling respect . " Yes , Your Grace . " " That 's better . And as a bishop , to whom do you feel you owe your obedience ? " " To the Bishop of Culdi . " " Culdi ? " Kelson blurted , glancing from Nevan to Duncan in dismay.  | " Does that mean there were Culdi men with those of Trurill ? Assisting Loris in his escape ? " " Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan reminded him , returning his attention to the fidgeting Nevan . " Remember that he 's very literal-minded in this state . Bishop Nevan , are you saying that the Bishop of Culdi was aware of the escape plans of Archbishop Loris ? " " Yes , Your Grace . " " I see . Did he , perhaps , instigate them ? " " No , sir . " " Someone else approached him , then , with a proposition ? " " Yes , sir . " " Who was that ? " " I 'm not sure , Your Grace . " " Then , who do you think approached him ? " Nevan seemed to fight the response , but the name came out nonetheless . " Monsignor Gorony , Your Grace . " " Gorony ! " Kelson breathed . With a glance , Morgan silenced him and returned his attention to their reluctant informant . " Was Monsignor Gorony in your company , then ? " he asked . Nevan nodded . " And Brice of Trurill ? " Again , the nod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fourteen now . " " Because you were taken ? " " Yes , Your Grace . " " And where were you bound ? " Kelson asked . " Ratharkin , Majesty . " " For what purpose ? " " To consecrate the Lord Judhael Bishop of Ratharkin . " " Not of Meara ? " Duncan interjected . " No , sir . " " Why not ? " " Meara is to be a patriarchy under Bishop Creoda . " " Under Creoda , " Morgan repeated , exchanging glances with the astonishedKelson and Duncan . " And Loris ? " " He will become Primate again , of course . " " Not while I live and breathe , " Kelson muttered under his breath.  | " Tell me this , then , Nevan . Does Bishop Creoda owe his obedience to Loris or to Braden ? " " To Archbishop Loris , Majesty . " " And there are other bishops who feel the same way ? " Nevan nodded agreement . " How many ? " Nevan thought a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creoda ? " " Yes , Majesty . " " And I suppose you know who they are ? " " Yes , Majesty . " " Name them . " " Bel  --  " The pattern of obedience had been well set , but Nevan stopped in midsyllable , fighting the command . Impatiently Morgan twitched at his controls , taking up just a fraction more of Nevan 's ability to resist . " Name the other bishops , Nevan , " he said softly . " We have n't all ay . " The eyes closed , but the lips parted once more . " Belden , Bishop of Cashien ; Lachlan , Bishop of Ballymar ; and the four itinerant bishops , Mir de Kierney , Calder of Sheele , Gilbert Desmond , and Raymer de Valence . " " And he 's consecrating Judhael  --  he 'll have a whole rival hierarchy ! " Duncan muttered . " Damn his impertinence . " " His impertinence does n't bother me nearly as much as the fact that he 's succeeding , " Kelson said grimly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a thing I can do to stop him until the spring . Well , maybe he 's made a fatal miscalculation . Guards ! " Kelson 's council judged that their king was making a fatal miscalculationat first . " It 's sheerest folly , Sire , " Ewan argued , from his place three seats down from the king at the council table . " You ca n't hope to mount a successful campaign this late in the season ! It 's December , for God 's sake ! " " Which is precisely why I 'm going now , " Kelson replied . " They wo n't be expecting me . Ratharkin is well fortified , but I wo n't believe the citizenrycould have been won over that completely to Loris ' leadership already . At best , he probably has control of the episcopal forces and nominal control of the city . A show of royal force , especially in December , when he thinks I ca n't do it , may be sufficient to break his strength . "  | " Perhaps he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting opposite Ewan . " If he has the support of the Mearan Pretender , he may be heading straight for Laas . " Kelson shook his head . " No , Nevan said Ratharkin . Loris has episcopalbusiness to settle before he takes the time for secular politics . And I have a bishop in Ratharkin that I 've sworn to protect . " " And you also have a friend in hostage there , Sire , if Loris has indeed gone to Ratharkin , " Archbishop Bradene observed . " Might that not be clouding your judgment ? " " I have a duty to protect them both , Archbishop , " Kelson replied . " And Loris must not be allowed to gain any more of a toehold than he already has . I should n't have to lecture you , of all people , about Loris . " " I still do n't like it , Sire , " said Arilan , who had already made it quite clear what else he did not like , when he heard of the manner of questioningNevan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ratharkin fully garrisoned , which I doubt , " Kelson interrupted pointedly , " he does not have sufficient strength to come out from behind the city walls and defeat a force the size I plan to bring . We would have heard of any large massing of troops . Even in Laas , there 's been no report yet of anything larger than a household guard . At worst , it 's a standoff and we come back home . " " I can think of worse , Sire , " Cardiel sighed , " but be that as it may . Perhaps you 're right . I shall pray that you are . But suppose that you are n't ? If you were to be captured or killed  --  " " If it will ease your mind , Archbishop , then be assured that my uncle is remaining here as regent , " Kelson answered . " If anything should happen to me , he will be your king  --  and he has three sons to succeed him . " " And you should have sons to succeed you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on such harebrained ventures . " Kelson grinned , almost glad for the old argument . " Do n't I need a wife for that , Ewan ? " he quipped . " Then stay home an ' take a wife , lad ! " Ewan returned . " Spend the winter in bed with a bonnie queen , making bairns  --  not dashin ' about in the snow , taking on rebel archbishops and God knows what else ! There 'll be time enough in the spring for making war . " Chuckling , Kelson motioned Duncan to take up pen and parchment , shaking his head in affection . " I wish I could stay home , Ewan . Nothing would please me more . Now , I 'll need the household troops , Nigel  --  and gentlemen , precisely because it is winter , I 'll need to raid each of your personal guard units to augment my own . I 'll want a hundred knights , lightly mounted for ma/neuverability and speed , and the minimum support force . I 'll take Morgan , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll leave to begin preparing summons of array for the spring , in case this does n't resolve everything . Duncan , as Duke of Cassan I 'd take you as well , but Nigel may need your good offices here in Rhemuth . " He did not say that Duncan would also be his Deryni link back to his capital , but Arilan seemed to sense it . " Should n't you take a bishop to represent the legitimate episcopal hierarchy , Sire ? " he asked , as prelude to including himself in the campaign . " The matter is best handled by secular authorities at this point , Excellency , " Morgan answered for the king , before Kelson had to stumble over a reason not to include Arilan as that bishop . " Unless His Majesty particularly wants to risk one of his loyal bishops in this venture  --  ? " He glanced at Kelson , ready to back down if the king had strong reasons for wanting to include the disputed Arilan , but to his relief Kelsonshook his head . " That wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sworn man , it 's out of ecclesiastical jurisdiction . Now , does anyone have a major objection that has n't already been stated ? " No one had . " Then , I suggest we all set about making the necessary preparations . I suspect Loris has agents here in Rhemuth , so I want to leave tonight , under cover of darkness , before anyone has a chance to send word ahead and warn him . Morgan , let 's get started . " As he rose and headed toward the great double doors leading from the chamber , the others stood and made their bows , Morgan exchanging a resigned glance with Duncan before falling into step behind the king.  |p131Therefore  the prudent shall keep silence in that time ; for it is an evil time.  --  Amos 5:13Two days later , as Kelson and his battle force rode toward Ratharkin in an icy rain , the Pretender of Meara entered the city gates with her husband and children . Snow had been falling since before dawn , discouragingcasual travel , so her party passed largely unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates at the bishop 's palace recognized the old Mearan colors her captain carried , and hailed her as she passed . She took their homage as her due ; she rode like a queen . The Lady Caitrin Quinnell of Meara had never been a beautiful woman ; nor had the years been kind . But at sixty-one , she was compelling in that cool self-possession that sometimes comes of the promise of power and the unquenchable belief that one has been wronged by one 's station in life but eventually will be vindicated . The white palfrey she rode was not a large animal , but the top of Caitrin 's immaculately coifed head barely reached its shoulder when the Baron of Trurill handed her down in the snowcoveredpalace yard . When he kissed her hand , she acknowledged the salute like a queen receiving homage , polite but aloof as she waited for the rest of her entourage to dismount around her . " Welcome to Ratharkin , Your Royal Highness , " Trurill murmured . " Or perhaps I shall be privileged to greet you as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Baron of Trurill , your most humble servant . Your hosts await you inside . " She favored him with a quick smile , distracted and distant as she tapped a riding crop gently against her gloved hand , nodding toward the bearded man in border tartan who joined her from behind . He was plainp132of face and a little thickset , but robust and fit , his costly riding leathers cut to enhance muscular legs . " My husband , the Lord Sicard MacArdry , " she said , by way of introduction . " And these are my children : Prince Ithel , Prince Llewell , and the Princess Sidana . " Brice 's jaw dropped a little as the three approached , for in addition to being far younger than he had been led to expect , Caitrin 's offspring were strikingly handsome . He had no idea where they had gotten their aristocraticlooks  --  neither Caitrin nor Sicard could have been described as more than pleasant looking , even in their youth  --  but it seemed the couple had thrown three of the comeliest offspring Brice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than King Kelson , compared very favorably with the king himself for poise , bearing , and fairness of feature ; and the young princessBrice had to consciously remind himself that he was contentedly married , and such a lass not for the likes of him in any case . Short but sapling-slender , with curling locks the color of chestnut burrs escaping from beneath her travel hood , Sidana seemed the embodiment of Brice 's every feminine ideal , dark eyes holding the dreamy mystery of some creature from another realm : worldly yet innocent , wise but naive . She inclined her head politely in his direction as she noticed his rapt interest , but she did not resort to the condescension so often shown by other girls of rank in similar circumstances . Her kindness enabled him to shake off her spell without making too much of a spectacle of himself . " Ah , you find my daughter attractive , my lord baron ? " he heard Sicardsaying , the border lord 's face creased with faint amusement as he extended his hand in greeting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurted out the truth . " I ' faith , my lord , she is exquisite . I had no idea . She will bring great honor to the man fortunate enough to win her hand . " " Aye , she will that , " Caitrin said a little impatiently , " though she is not for just any lord , as I am sure you can appreciate . " She took her elder son 's arm and peered past Brice toward the doors . " But may we go inside now ? Our attendants will see to the horses and baggage . It has been hours since our last warmth and refreshment . " A short time later , when an embarrassed Brice had shown the royal guests into the bishop 's receiving room and the usual amenities had been exchanged , refreshment taken , royal and episcopal conspirators settled down to serious discussion . Sidana had made her apologies and retired to rest with her ladies , but her two brothers sat expectantly to either side of their parents , keen to be included in the exchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Cassan , " Caitrin said grimly , as Loris took a chair directly opposite her , with Creoda , Judhael , and Brice flanking him . " Cassan is to be Ithel 's , when McLain is dead . With McLaina bishop , it 's conceivable he would try to leave it to the Church . " " And Kierney as well , " Ithel said , from his mother 's right . Brice thought the boy 's dark eyes made him look a little like a vulture in that instant . Sipping delicately at a cup of mulled wine , Creoda shook his head . " Not to the Church , Highness . To the Crown . McLain is the king 's man . We did try to eliminate him , however . " Caitrin shrugged . " A poor try , I hear . He was fit enough to attend Mass the next day . " " The archfiend Morgan came to his aid , " Loris muttered . " He used his Deryni sorcery to heal him . " " That was after the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . " ' T is said that McLain himself warded off the attack . Did you send a child to do a man 's work ? " Anger flared briefly in Loris ' face , but his response was temperate and controlled . " The boy was young , yes , but he had been trained in McLain 's own household . He knew what he was doing . A man could not have gained access as readily . McLain was wounded  --  " " But to no avail , it seems  --  " " My Lord Sicard , the drug on the blade should have rendered anyone with Deryni blood quite incapable of effective defense , " Loris explained patiently . " And for a priest , conditioned not to kill if it can be avoided , the added hesitation should have been fatal . " " No matter now , " Caitrin murmured , toying with her goblet . " It was n't fatal , so we shall have to eliminate McLain some other way . Beforethat , however , there is the matter of my nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he returned . " How soon are you prepared to proceed with his consecration as bishop , my Lord Loris ? " Loris inclined his head . " Tomorrow , if you wish , Highness . It is regrettablethat Bishop Istelyn continues to resist the inevitable , but Bishop Creoda and several others will be honored to assist me in that happy task . " " So you said in your letter , " Caitrin replied , glancing at her husband . " You said also that the Master of Transha is in your custody . Would you care to explain that ? " Blinking in surprise , Loris glanced from one to the other of them , husband and wife , then at Creoda , who shrugged.  | " I landed near Transha , Highness , as I am certain I informed you , " Loris said cautiously . " The boy led a patrol which tried to intercept me . My Lord Brice took him hostage to insure our escape , and we kept him because Transha 's support could be valuable in the future . The boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't agree , it is n't too late to kill him . " " Kill him ? " Sicard gasped , half rising from his chair . As Loris jerked back in surprise and Brice and Creoda poised to intervene , Caitrin caught at her husband 's hand . " Peace , Sicard . He obviously does not know . Peace , my lords  --  please . " As all of them subsided , Caitrin returned her attention to Loris , at the same time gently stroking her husband 's hand . " In all the intensity of your own escape , you obviously have forgotten my husband 's clan , Archbishop , " she said carefully . " The young Master of Transha is my husband 's nephew . My Lord Sicard has not spoken to his brother , the boy 's father , for many years , but you must realize that blood is very important to border folk . The fact that Sicard and Caulay had a falling out does not lessen my husband 's affection for his only surviving blood nephew . " Loris smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have no quarrel , dear lady , since young Dhugal is in good health and waits upon your pleasure . Would you like to see him ? " " Immediately , " Sicard murmured . " But , of course  --  though I assure you , he is honorably detained . He presently shares quarters with Bishop Istelyn , who has been seeing to the injuries he received when he was captured . Nothing too serious , I assure you . Come . I 'll take you to him . " Dhugal MacArdry stretched carefully , then moved one of his archers on the gameboard set between himself and Istelyn , glancing up to see the bishop 's reaction . Istelyn raised an eyebrow and passed a ringed hand across his mouth and lower jaw as he studied the new tactical situation , deep in thought . It was now more than a week since Dhugal 's capture , and his injuries were healing with the swiftness often granted to the young and healthy . His head still throbbed a little if he moved too quickly or tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant ache of his ribs had eased to only an occasional twinge . Nor did it hurt to breathe . For the last day or two , he had even begun light exercise to start getting back into shape.  |p135He  flexed his sword hand and made a fist , heartened by the increased strength he felt , then stiffened and looked up as footsteps approached the outer door . Istelyn pursed his lips in resignation but rose as the door opened , gesturing for Dhugal to rise as well . Dhugal obeyed , for it would do no good to antagonize their captors . " You have visitors , Lord Dhugal , " Loris said , moving through the doorway as the guard stepped back . " I assured them you 've been treated with all the proper respect due your rank . " As Dhugal 's eyes darted to the figures entering behind Loris , his heart sank . The rather plain-looking older woman he did not know , but he could guess her identity from her company . Even had the man at her side not worn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakable stamp of kindred blood . It could only be his black-sheep uncle , Sicard MacArdry , and the woman , the Pretender Caitrin . " Kinsman , " Dhugal murmured neutrally , in case he was mistaken , inclining his head in a polite bow . White teeth flashed in the man 's heavy beard and mustaches as he chuckled delightedly . " So , my brother 's son has grown to manhood , eh ? We hear you gave His Excellency 's escort a hard time , lad . " Dhugal merely inclined his head again . " I but did my duty to my father , sir . As his heir , I could do no other . " The woman raised an eyebrow and glanced over at her husband , apparentlypleased with his answer . " The boy speaks well , Sicard , and seems to know how to guard his tongue . Perhaps blood will show him his new duty as well . Will you introduce my nephew ? " Sicard gave her a little bow and called Dhugal closer with a gesture . Dhugal approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " An ' it please my Liege Lady , " Sicard murmured , " I beg leave to present my brother 's son , Lord Dhugal MacArdry : heir to the Earldom of Transha and tanist of Clan MacArdry . Dhugal , Her Royal Highness The Princess Caitrin of Meara . If you are wiser than your father , I hope you will acknowledge her as your future liege . Transha was once part of Old Meara , and shall be again , if the fates are kind . " Dhugal 's heart was chilled by the implication , but it was only what he had expected . Putting on what he hoped was one of his most wide-eyed and naive expressions , he took the hand Caitrin extended and brushed the knuckles with his lips in polite salute . He could feel Istelyn stiffen behind him in disapproval.  | " I am honored to make your acquaintance , Lady , " he said , turning earnest eyes shyly upon her . " Often while I was growing up , I mourned the fact that my father 's quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cousins . I hope you will not hold his quarrel against me . " " A wise lad , " she replied , taking him by the shoulders to formally kiss him on either cheek . " We shall talk more of this after your cousin Judhael 's consecration tomorrow , if you comport yourself as the wellbredlad you appear to be . " She drew back to glance at Istelyn , who returned her gaze stonily , then nodded to Loris . " I wish Lord Dhugal to have an honored place at the ceremony tomorrow , my Lord Archbishop . He is family . I wish him treated as such . " Loris bowed . " If the Lord Dhugal will give his word not to interfere with the proceedings , I am certain that can be arranged , Highness . " " Well , Dhugal ? " She glanced at him pointedly . " Can we trust you to conduct yourself befitting your blood ? " Dropping to one knee , Dhugal bowed his head and murmured his wholehearted agreement . If that were all the oath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his blood and honor bound him to his king and brother above all . And by gaining their trust , he might yet escape to warn Kelson . " Swear on the Cross , then , " Loris said , not unexpectedly , starting to extend his pectoral cross for Dhugal to kiss . " Nay , on second thought , you shall swear on Istelyn 's cross , lest you harbor some scruple about the one I wear . Istelyn , attend . " As Loris snapped his fingers toward Istelyn and held out his hand , Dhugal thought the bishop might refuse at first  --  Istelyn was looking thoroughly disapproving at what must surely appear to be a defection . But Loris ' command left no room for disobedience . Defiance would only mean the taking of the cross by force . Unlooping the chain from around his neck , Istelyn averted his eyes and held out the sacred relic . Loris glanced at the kneeling Dhugal and complicated the matter . " I think Bishop Istelyn should administer the oath as well , " he said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross down to Dhugal 's eye-level . " Place your hand on this holy symbol and swear the oath to Istelyn , young Dhugal . And know that if you are forsworn , you will burn in hell for your sin ! " Dhugal 's jaw dropped in very real misgiving , but he knew he had already made his decision as he laid his palm on the cross in Istelyn 's hand : his first obedience was to God and the king , and that obedience superseded all other oaths which he might be required to make under duress.  | " Swear that you will take no action to disrupt tomorrow 's proceedings , " Istelyn said softly , at Loris ' impatient buffet of his imprisoned wrist . The words were precisely what Caitrin had specified , and Dhugal thought he could still give his oath in good conscience . Perhaps Istelyn had even recognized that the wording left room for interpretation . But before Dhugal could bend to kiss the cross in confirmation , Loris ' free hand clamped around their joined ones , pressing the metal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will make no attempt to escape , " Loris demanded . " Give me your parole , and you shall be accorded all the honor due your rank . " " I swear it , " Dhugal murmured , dragging the words reluctantly from the depths of his soul as he raised frightened eyes to the rebel archbishop 's . " Say the actual words of the oath , " Loris insisted . Dhugal squirmed inside , but he had no choice but to obey . " I give my parole that I shall not attempt to escape , " he said steadily . " And that I shall do nothing to disrupt the proceedings . . . " Lorisprompted . " And that I shall do nothing to disrupt the proceedings , " Dhugal repeated . " So help me God .... " " So help me God . " " And may my soul burn in hell if I keep not this solemn oath  --  say it ! " Loris ordered . Chilled despite his intentions , Dhugal turned genuinely frightened eyes on Caitrin in appeal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and may my soul burn in hell if I keep not this solemn oath , " he managed to choke out . " Now kiss the cross , " Loris said , releasing his cruel grip . Blindly Dhugal obeyed , adding his own fervent prayer that God would forgive him for taking the oath in vain . He was shaking with the exertion the act had cost him as he stood , but Caitrin looked pleased and even Loris seemed satisfied . Istelyn 's expression revealed nothing as he put the cross back around his neck , meeting Loris ' gaze defiantly as archbishop and then pretender turned their attention on him instead of Dhugal . " And what of you , Bishop ? " Caitrin said softly . " I am not so naive as to think you can be won as easily as my young nephew , but you shall be present at Judhael 's consecration tomorrow . Whether you attend in the honor due your station is up to you . "  |p138Istelyn  bowed his head . " I will not be a party to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of this man whose escape you apparently have fostered  --  and you are foolish to think that the king will do nothing while you usurp his authority in his own lands . " " Meara is mine , not Kelson 's , " Caitrin answered . " It is a part of Gwynedd , and was lawfully joined to it generations ago , " Istelyn said stubbornly . " If you stand with this renegade priest , you join in treason against your lawful Lord . " " History will decide whether it is treason , " Loris retorted , " just as history will decide whether your decision was wise . You may have overnightto reconsider your position but you will witness Father Judhael 's consecration tomorrow , even if you must be drugged and bound to your throne half-conscious . Do not make the mistake of thinking this an empty threat . It can and will be done . " " Then , the legitimacy of what you are doing does matter , does n't it , Loris ? " Istelyn turned his gaze on Caitrin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about to do . It still is not too late to reverse what you have begun and beg the king 's pardon . Loris is a fugitive , and will be dealt with , but you have committed no grave offenses if you back off now . " Outraged , Loris lifted a hand to strike him , but Sicard blocked his wrist at Caitrin 's quick signal . " We shall take your advice under consideration , Bishop , " Caitrin said smoothly , " as we hope you shall take ours . Archbishop Loris , we have more to discuss in private , I think . " She glanced at the silent and wideeyedDhugal as Sicard moved to open the door . " Nephew , if you value the life of this foolish priest , you would do well to try to convince him of the error of his stand . You shall dine with us this evening and report your progress . " She turned and swept through the open doorway after Sicard even as the astonished Dhugal made a hasty bow . Loris cast Istelyn one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhugal 's direction , then followed . Dhugal exhaled softly as soon as the bolts had snicked shut on the other side , glancing uneasily at the now-shaking Isteyln . " So that 's my Aunt Caitrin , " he murmured . Istelyn shot him a look of undiluted disgust and turned away , making his way blindly to the prie-dieu to collapse with his head cradled on his folded arms . After a moment Dhugal followed , kneeling awkwardly on the bare stone beside him . " Please do n't be angry with me , Excellency , " he whispered , trying top139will the bishop to raise his head . " You do n't think I really mean to do anything that would help Loris , do you ? " Istelyn 's whisper could barely be heard from behind his folded forearms . " You swore an oath , Dhugal  --  in terrible terms . Do you mean to be forsworn ? " " I  --  I had no choice . " Istelyn looked up coldly . " You had a choice : the same choice that I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully . His ribs were aching again from the pounding of his heart . " I gave the king my word , " he murmured . " And if it costs me my soul , I 'll keep my word  --  to him . " He folded his hands carefully , interlacing the fingers , and pressed them tightly clasped to his chin . " But I ca n't escape to warn him if I 'm too closely guarded , " he went on very softly . " Maybe I ca n't escape anyway  --  but at least I have to try . And if I 'm going to try , I owe it to him to give myself the best possible chance of succeeding . " " Even at the cost of breaking your sacred oath ? " Istelyn asked . " Whatever the cost , " Dhugal whispered . He could not convince Istelyn that the wisest course lay in pretending to cooperate with their captors , however . He tried until a servant came to fetch him for dinner , but the bishop maintained his stand : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitulating to the enemy . Istelyn would not be moved . " But they mean to have you there , Excellency  --  probably even if they have to prop up your dead body on its throne ! " Dhugal had said at last . " You ca n't help the king if you 're dead ! " " Perhaps . But I will die knowing that I was true to my office and my God . Loris will never have that satisfaction . " Dhugal thought about what Istelyn had said as he followed the servant into the bishop 's great hall , his spirits temporarily dampened by the heavy weight of duty , but he had all he could do to keep his wits about him once he sat down to supper . They put him at the far end of the high table with a man-at-arms to watch as well as serve him , and he knew that many others watched for errors as well . Increasingly conscious of the dangerous charade he played , he kept his peace and did his best to stay wide-eyed and awed-looking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that he had been fostered to a finer court in Rhemuth , but if anyone had , Dhugal plannedp140to shrug it off as time ill spent for a borderman . In fact , he had not been at court for several years , so it took little effort to slip into the more relaxed border manners common in his father 's hall : loud and boisterous , hearty in appetite and more uninhibited in behavior than would have been seemly in Rhemuth . Once he got into his role , however , maintaining it was easy . He was soon introduced to his cousins , Ithel and Llewell , both about his age , and the stunningly beautiful Sidana . " I do n't suppose you see many ladies to compare with this in Transha , " Prince Ithel said proudly , pouring his sister another cup of ale . " Meara will be the center of the civilized world when we 're done  --  you 'll see . " He was just drunk enough to mistake Dhugal 's nervous laughter for awe , Sidana also joining in the mirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dhugal when he thought Dhugal did n't notice and brooding over his cup . Ruthlessly Dhugal set about to win all their confidence , drawing out the taciturn Llewell , hearing accounts of the princes ' martial exploits with feigned awe , and eventually joining in the good-natured teasing which Sidana endured from her older brothers . He was nearly one of them by the time dinner was over . One of the children , however  --  not one of the men . Over stronger wine , after the ladies had retired , a possibly intoxicated Sicard drew his stool close beside Dhugal 's and began sounding him out about old Caulay'spolitics , hinting that once Caulay was gone , Meara was in a position to better Dhugal 's lot considerably . Dhugal suspected his uncle was far more sober than he seemed . He hid his true feelings well , however , even pretending pleased interest in Sicard'soffer of a dukedom when the secession was accomplished . He gathered that he gave the right answers . He drank with Sicard and his sons for another hour , somehow managing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a tipsy Llewell , and the watchful and still sober man-at-arms walked him to his room when the reveling was done , the two princes singing him a noisy salute as future Duke of Transha before giving him a playful buffet through the doorway of his room . Istelyn was still cold to him , however . Dhugal found him on his knees in the little oratory , but the bishop would not look at him after an initial , disdainful sweep of him from head to toe , turning a contemptuous back on him after that . Nor could Dhugal elicit any verbal response . He crept under the sleeping furs on his pallet feeling like a snake , tearsp141streaming silently down his cheeks until he at last slipped into uneasy sleep . His dreams edged almost immediately into nightmares : Judgment Day . Naked and afraid , he cowered at the foot of the great golden Throne of Heaven as a wrathful Istelyn raised one hand toward the Light in mute appeal , stabbing accusingly at Dhugal with the other . Hosts of weeping angels bore the supine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a dozen wounds . Frantic , Dhugal tried to explain . Kelson could not be dead , and Dhugalcertainly was not to blame . But the king suddenly lifted his head and raised one gory hand to also point in Dhugal 's direction , the flesh melting from the bones as Dhugal watched in horror , the eyes but empty sockets in a masklike skull . The nightmare wrenched Dhugal out of sleep . Gasping for breath , he woke in a cold sweat , terrified that it was real , that he had already killed his brother and his king . But the room was dark , Istelyn no longer kneeling in the oratory but wrapped in his sleeping furs on the other side of the room , his back to Dhugal , only a dark blur in the dim light of dying fire . It had only been a dream after all . Dhugal 's head pounded from the wine , however , even after the terror of the dream had passed , and he slept no more . Nursing his apprehensionsand his hangover , he searched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasped to his lips in intermittent prayer . The hours seemed to crawl until grey dawn at last streaked the sky and he could rise to wash and dress , a much sobered young man . The object of Dhugal 's prayers also saw the dawn that morning , a day 's hard ride south of Ratharkin . Letting his horse blow at the top of a high pass , Kelson hunched down in his fur-lined cloak and gnawed on a lump of tough brown journey bread , glancing aside as Morgan drew rein beside him . They had been riding this leg of the journey since midnight , and planned no further pause until they reached Ratharkin . The rain had given way to a light snow during the night , with promise of more to come . Behind them , stretching back along the trail by twos , the hundred knights of their escort adjusted girths and bridle buckles and took advantage of the brief stop to eat or sleep or relieve themselves . Conall dozed on his horse behind and to Kelson 's left , nodding in the saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , so low that even Morgan barely could hear him . " He has to be . If he were dead , I 'd know  --  would n't I ? " " I honestly do n't know , my prince . "  | " But we 're closer now ! " Kelson protested . " If he 's still alive , should n't I have been able to touch something during the night ? We were so close that night in Transha . " " Until you triggered the shutdown of his shields , " Morgan reminded him gently . " You also had physical contact that time  --  and you know how much more difficult it is to establish rapport without it . A deliberate shielding  --  " " It is n't deliberate . Not from me . " " Very well -- not from you . But if he is shielded ... ? " " Are you saying he is n't ? " Morgan sighed patiently . " Touchy this morning , are n't you ? Kelson , I have n't even seen the boy since he was  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Shaking his head , Kelson shrugged again dispiritedly . " That long ago , how would either of us have known ? He has shields now , though . " " Very well . And that 's undoubtedly the reason you have n't been able to reach him . " Morgan reached across to clap the king 's shoulder in reassurance . " In any case , we should know something soon . We 'll be at Ratharkin before dark . " " Before dark  --  yes . But will it be in time ? " Kelson wondered.  |p143They  fall into many actions and businesses , and are void of sense , and when they think of things pertaining unto God , they understand nothing at all.  --  II Hermas 10:12The sparse noonday sun turned the stained glass of Saint Uriel 's to darkly glowing jewels , but the cathedral 's glory brought little comfort to Dhugal , kneeling meekly in the choir with the Mearan royal family . The consecration of Judhael as Bishop of Ratharkin was about to begin  --  and there was nothing Dhugal could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had spoken not a word on his awakening , to Dhugal or to the priest sent to inquire a final time whether he would assist with Judhael 's consecration . Later he still stood mute as two deaconsvested him , not resisting their ministrations or the cup which a coldeyedGorony commanded him to drink when they had done . Dhugal could see the drug 's effect in Istelyn 's eyes even as the two deacons walked him out of the room between them , Gorony following , and thought he knew what they had given him . He could expect no help from Istelyn for many hours , if then . Dhugal was alone , then . He could depend on no one 's resources but his own . Those kneeling around him claimed to have accepted him as family , and promised much in return for his support , but he knew they did not trust him yet ; he had given them no cause to trust him other than the face value of his apparent opportunism . His very position in the seating , between Sicard and Llewell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily and quietly subdued , should he attempt a disruption despitehis word . Dressed in the princely raiment they had brought him that morning  --  Ithel 's , by the length of the richly embroidered cloak  --  he did look like one of them . Even his borderman 's braid did not set him much apart , for Sicard and several of his personal attendants wore them as well , even if the two princes did not.  |p144Far  at the back of the cathedral , the choir began to chant the entrance antiphon . The nave was packed . Great liturgies of state were always popular with the common folk , with their chance to at least glimpse the rich and the highborn , and the appetites of Ratharkin 's citizenry had been whetted not a fortnight before , when Istelyn had been installed . Dhugal wondered whether they had flocked in such numbers for their rightful lord as they did for a usurper 's kin . But perhaps they did not know . As the procession entered the church and headed down the aisle , those around Dhugal stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led by a thurifer , incense bearer , servers with candles , and then a processional cross and the choir . A second thurifer came after them , followed by the entourages of the various bishops assisting in the ceremony , each preceded by his crozier bearer and followed by two boys with candles . Dhugal could not identify any of the bishops preceding Judhael by sight , but he had been told that one of them was Bishop Calder  --  brother of his mother and , therefore , another uncle . He had not expected that . The prelates escorting the new bishop-elect were quite unmistakable , however : the forsworn Creoda , whom Kelson had trusted , and Belden of Erne , the youngish Bishop of Cashien , come up from the south . Dhugal knew him by the arms emblazoned on the back of his white cope , and wondered whether Kelson had suspected his betrayal any more than he had Creoda 's , or the others . And Judhael himself , yet another of Dhugal 's hitherto only legendary Mearan cousins . The young bishop-elect glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a tiny smile of satisfaction played about his lips  --  unseemly even in a righteous man on his way to his sacring , Dhugal thought . Bishop 's purple showed slightly at throat and hem , but he was vested with a priest 's alb and stole beneath his white cope , hands joined piously before his breast . Dhugal wondered how he had the courage to come before the altar thus , knowing that his election was against the will of the rightful primate and the king . Perhaps God would smite him for his insolence . Dhugal wished He would . And if not Judhael , then certainly the despised Loris , following in the full habiliments of his usurped office , precious mitre sparkling like a crown above his costly golden cope . Servers bearing candles and his crozier preceded him , and close behind came Istelyn , leaning heavily on the arms of the two deacons Dhugal had seen before . Istelyn appeared still to be moving under his own power , but his eyes were heavy-lidded and vague ; Dhugal suspected he would nod off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throne . The treacherous Monsignor Gorony brought up the rear . Dhugal had never seen a bishop made before , so he was not sure when the ceremony departed from the form of the simple Mass he knew . It was difficult to follow the actions of half a dozen priests when he was accustomed to watching only one ; and once-familiar words took on odd accentsand emphasis when chanted by a full choir . Taking his cues from those around him , he stood and knelt when they did , swallowing his disgust and outrage when the traitorous bishops gathered before the throne Loris had no right to occupy and the chiefest traitor of them all delivered a short instruction on the responsibilities of a bishop . Judhael was then brought before Loris to respond to formal questions . " Dearly beloved brother , " Loris intoned solemnly , " ancient custom dictates that bishops-elect are to be questioned before the people on their resolve to keep the faith and discharge their duties justly . I therefore ask thee , Judhael of Meara , whether thou art resolved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thy life the office entrusted to us by the apostles which is about to be passed on to thee by the imposition of our hands ? " " I am , " Judhael answered . " And art thou resolved to be faithful and constant in proclaiming the gospel of Our Lord ? " " I am . " The ritual dialogue went on , but Dhugal had no stomach to listen closely . Whatever promises Judhael made under these circumstances , and however pious a man he might have been before the advent of Loris ' plotting , Dhugal was as certain as he was of his own simple faith that Judhael of Meara was damned for participating in this mockery of holy rite . Why did God not strike him dead ? Was there no justice , even in the very House of God ? He feared greatly for Istelyn , too , though it was the man 's body which gave him greater concern than the man 's soul . He could not but admire the man 's courage  --  forced to condone the affair by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not support it in his heart  --  but Dhugal was made of more practical stuff . He did wonder whether he himself had taken the easier way , by pretending to go along with those he knew to be wrong  --  and whether Istelyn was right : that Dhugal was dishonored by going as far as he had gone already . And as for how far he intended to go , if there were opportunity " Beloved brothers and sisters , " Loris chanted , standing to face the congregation , " let us pray for this man chosen to provide for the needs ofp146God 's Holy Church . Let us pray that Almighty God in His goodness will fill him with abundant grace . " Dhugal knelt with the others at that , watching the forsworn Judhael prostrate himself before the altar while the rest of the bishops knelt around him , even Istelyn being propped kneeling at his faldstool to the side . The choir sang a Kyrie , familiar to Dhugal even in its embellished form , then shifted deftly into a litany of angels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sancta Maria ... " " Ora pro nobis . " " Sancte Michael ... " " Ora pro nobis . " " Sancte Gabriel . . . " " Ora pro nobis . " " Sancte Raphael .. " Ora pro nobis . " " Sancte Uriel ... " " Ora pro nobis " " Omnes sancti Angell et Archangel ! ... " " Orate pro nobis ... " The litany went on and on , the cadences lulling the senses , and Dhugal let his mind drift back to his own dilemma . Though he had given his word he would not try to escape , his duty to Kelson dictated otherwise , despite the terrible oath Loris had made him swear on holy relics . He knew Istelyn did not approve , and counted an oath on oath , regardless of the circumstances under which it was made  --  and perhaps he was right . Perhaps there was no compromising with evil . But the greater evil , if Kelson did not learn of what was happening here today , seemed to Dhugal to outweigh the niceties of semantics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , regardless of his sworn oath . Time enough , if he succeeded , to seek absolution . He would not betray his brother . Increasingly angry and indignant , he watched the traitor bishops go through the form of consecrating Judhael : the imposition of hands , the anointing with sacred chrism , the giving of ring , mitre , and crozier , the bringing of the gifts of eucharistic bread and wine by his family  --  Caitrin and Sicard and their children . At least they did not ask him to assist them . But he was expected to go forward and receive communion with the rest of them , after the new bishop had ordained a deacon and concelebratedMass with his new brothers . And he was spared receiving itp147from Judhael only to have Loris himself lay the consecrated wafer on his tongue . Dhugal had all he could do not to choke on it as he returned to his place with folded hands and downcast eyes , hating the hypocrisy which forced him to pretend the same traitor 's game which they played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God would forgive him for receiving the Sacrament with as much loathing in his heart as he felt for the treacherous Loris . The final strains of a solemn sung Te Deum followed them out onto the cathedral porch when it was over . Surrounded by senior clergy and his family , the new bishop paused on the cathedral steps to impart his first episcopal blessings to the people outside . Dhugal was drawn along with them , by virtue of his kinship with Sicard , but surveillance seemed to have lessened in the general excitement of the event and he found it possible to ease into the background , almost blending in with the family 's lesser retainers . The bite of a coming storm was in the wind , so he pulled up the fur-edged hood of his cloak against it and began a casual survey of the cathedral square while he pretended merely to savor the fresh air . Other than to enter the cathedral a few hours before , he had not been out of doors since his arrival in the city . From what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did not know Ratharkin at all , but movement in and out of the square appeared to be unhampered and unregulated . The south gates of the city lay less than half a mile beyond the mouth of a narrow street opening off west of the square . He had marked the way well in his mind as they rode here this morning , and a possible alternate route through another side street . Of more important immediate concern was the help or hindrance Dhugalmight expect from the milling citizens , many of whom were making their way closer to kneel for the new bishop 's blessing . From what he had overheard , no one seemed to see Judhael 's creation as Bishop of Ratharkin as any encroachment on the recently installed Istelyn , for Istelyn was Bishop of Meara . Besides , was not Bishop Istelyn standing at the new bishop 's side , affirming the new bishop 's legitimacy by his mere presence ? Clearly , Judhael was meant to assist the bishop installed by archbishops and king a fortnight before  --  and who would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , standing beneath a banner in the Mearan royal colors , only added local interest , for who of the commonfolk knew what lord had placed his hands between whose ? If Meara 's senior royal was here , publicly witnessing the elevation of her nephew in the presence of the king 's duly appointed and enthroned repre/sentative , Bishop Istelyn , who could say she was not entitled ? And a prelate of Mearan royal blood could not but please most residents of this ancient Mearan city , regardless of the lip-service professed to the Crown of Gwynedd . Dhugal dared not expect support from Ratharkin 's citizens , then . But at least the public acclamation of Judhael , distasteful as it was to Dhugal , perhaps gave convenient cover to explore escape options ; for with attentioncentered on Judhael and the rest of the Mearan royal family , there was very little notice being taken of Dhugal . Foot soldiers mingled with the throngs in the square , lining the cathedral steps as well , but none were very close to Dhugal . Less than a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them sat their mounts at ease near the gate leading back into the cathedral compound , only casually watching the crowd , but the nearest other men on horseback were clear across the square . If Dhugal could make his way close enough to surprise the men and secure one of the horses ... . Blowing on his gloved hands to warm them , he eased his way a few steps farther to his left , closer to the guards , casually eying the nearer horse  --  a wiry , fast-looking bay . Almost immediately the animal tossed its head and snorted , swinging its hindquarters against the sorrel beside it and dancing a little jig until its rider curbed it sharply . The other rider looked irritated and murmured something to his companion that Dhugal could not hear , as he jerked at his own mount 's mouth , but when the two stood once more at ease , both of them were several horse-lengths closer than they had been . It occurred to Dhugal to wonder whether the animalssomehow had been aware of his scrutiny , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with horses , but not that good . The pageantry of Judhael 's acclamation continued on the cathedral steps , but many of the Mearan folk were also hailing Caitrin now . From under his hood , Dhugal watched her bask in their homage , wondering whether they realized their treason  --  or if they cared . It was also beginning to snow again . Soon , despite the sweetness of public acclaim , they would all pack up and go inside , and his opportunity would be lost . He sidled a little closer to the horses , trying his best to appear nonchalant  --  andnearly jumped out of his skin when he felt a tug at his cloak from the right . " Ithel , it 's getting cold . I think we ought to  --  oh , I beg your pardon . " The voice was Sidana 's ; and as he curbed his initial urge to whirl inresponse and slowly turned instead , he saw by her expression what hadhappened . He was wearing Ithel 's clothes . Immediately he sensed a wayp149to take advantage of the error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No need to beg my pardon , fair cousin , " he murmured in his best court accents , catching her gloved hand to press it to his lips . " You 're the only one who 's addressed a kind word to me all morning  --  even if it was meant for someone else . " She blinked uncertainly , too flustered to withdraw her hand . " In faith , cousin , I had not known you pined for our kindness . You were merry enough last night , but wine will make even false men seem hale and earnest . My father was not certain you felt the bond of blood as strongly as we . " With a shrug , Dhugal let go her hand and wrapped his cloak more closely around him , stamping his feet against the cold and withdrawing turtlelike into the closeness of his hood . " In faith , cousin , the cold out here is cold enough without the chill of family rejection . The ride from my father 's lands taught me much of the realities of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new order , then it behooves me to listen to my blood  --  and especially to so fair a kinswoman . " The color rose in her cheeks at that , but she dared a tiny smile as she returned his gaze . " Are you flirting with me , kinsman ? " she asked , dark eyes teasing just a little . " We are first cousins , after all . " Dhugal decided not to pursue that line , though he let his eyes sweep her face in frank appraisal . With a tiny smile of his own , he shrugged and merely brushed a few snowflakes off the ruff of her hood . She paled a little and stifled a nervous giggle , poised to flee . " Wh-what are you doing ? " she whispered . " Why , displaying cousinly concern for your well-being , my lady , " he answered softly . " Did you not complain of the cold , only a moment ago ? " " Aye , it is getting colder . " " Then , allow me to act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm and gesturing gallantly toward the side gate  --  which also brought him closer to the unsuspecting guards . " I would not have so fair a flower as my cousin blighted by the chill . We can warm ourselves by the fire in the bishop 's hall and have something hot to drink .... " He had kept his face averted in his hood as they walked , ostensibly against the wind ; and as he set his hand to the gate latch and deliberately fumbled , the two mounted guards moved closer , the man on the sorrel dismounting with alacrity to give assistance  --  for he recognized Sidana ,  |p150and  thought her richly cloaked companion to be her royal brother . The man presented half a dozen open targets as he eased importantly between princess and supposed prince and bent to the latch  --  and likely never even felt the dagger which Dhugal filched from the man 's own boot-top and jammed home underneath his ribs . Before the stricken guard did more than wobble , eyes glazing even as a half-gasp died in his throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was lunging to catch the startled bay by the reins , twistingthe bit to yank it deftly to its knees and unseat its hapless rider . The exertion jabbed fire across his ribs , but he ignored the pain and vaulted into the bay 's empty saddle , grunting as the animal lurched to its feet . He kicked it into motion , hunting for his stirrups . The horse squealed and lashed out with battle-trained heels at foot soldiers approaching from the rear . Sidana finally screamed . He ignored her cry , for others were scattering and screaming all around him as well , parting before the plunging greathorse like a surging human tide . The bay 's former rider snatched at his reins , but Dhugal whirled his mount on its haunches and sent the man staggering  --  in the direction of the snorting sorrel . Brutally , Dhugal kneed the bay between the man and his new intended prize , knocking him to the ground before he could grab the dangling reins of either steed . The bay tried to bite him while he was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slashing with a dagger , trying to hamstring horse or rider . The man was bellowing for help now , still trying to catch the sorrel . Dhugal had to stop him , or his chance was lost . Swooping precariously low to slash at the man , he blocked another attempt to remount , at the same time praying that the animal would rear . To his astonishment , it did . The descending hooves slammed the man directly into one of Dhugal'sswordblows . Blood sprayed from a hand-wide gash in the man 's neck and reddened the trampled snow as his body disappeared under the sorrel 's churning hooves . Sidana , cowering against the still-closed gate , stared at the carnage in mute horror as Dhugal grabbed a fistful of reins and glanced around wildly for the nearest escape route  --  which was fast being filled by foot soldiers and other mounted men pressing through the throngs . He suspected that most of them had no idea who he really was . There was clear space around him now  --  except for the bloody body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse 's hooves would block pursuit for only so long . He must take his chances now . Far across the square he could see archers approaching . If he could not break free at once , they would cut him down . Kneeing his mount closer to the gate and the petrified Sidana , he seized her upperp151arm and dragged her up to the saddlebow in front of him , to shouts of dismay from the approaching soldiers . " Sorry , coz , but you must be my escort now , " he gasped , fighting to keep girl , sword , and his seat as he made the bay rear in defiance . " Out of my way , if you 'd not risk the lady 's safety ! " he shouted . She squirmed in his grasp , elbowing him in the ribs hard enough to nearly make him drop her , but he only swore under his breath and held her the more tightly , clapping heels to the horse and incredulously watching the guards melt from his path as he bolted for freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caitrin half-fainting , Loris mouthing unheard orders as Dhugal shot by them . His passage through the city streets became a blur of screaming , scattering people and shouting soldiers in pursuit , the chaos heightened by the loose horse which plunged along just ahead of them , helping to clear a path . Only a handful of riders pursued them at first . The city gates stood open as they usually did during daylight , and Dhugal and his still-struggling passenger careened past the gate guards and out across the snow-slick draw before anyone could do more than stare in surprise . His pursuers were heavier than he in their war harness , so Dhugal managed to pull away slowly for the first few miles  --  but only at the expense of his gallant bay , running out its heart for him . Doubles mounted , he could not sustain such a pace for long  --  but neither could his pursuers . He had temporarily lost sight of them when he pulled the blown bay to a shuddering halt and slid from its back , thrusting his sword upright in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weight and nearly went down , and Sidana clutched at the saddle , white-faced . " Easy , good friend , " Dhugal murmured , laying hands on the bay 's heaving chest and soothing with his voice . " Better service a man could not ask , but you have earned your rest . Your stablemate shall carry us from here . " Still stroking the spent animal with one hand , he turned and held out his other to the sorrel , whistling low . The second horse was also lathered and breathing heavily , steaming in the cold air , but still with spring in its step for having run unburdened . Whuffling softly , it pricked up its ears and came to butt its head against his chest and present a sweaty face for scratching . " There 's a good fellow , " Dhugal said with a grin as he obliged , glancingup at Sidana as he continued to stroke both animals . Her expression brought him to her side at once , to lift her down and let her sink onto the snow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry for your rough treatment , " he said , easing to a crouch beside her . " I had to get away , though  --  whatever the cost . " " Whatever for ? " she sobbed . " Did n't my father offer you enough ? Can you betray your blood so easily ? " " To have stayed would have been to betray it far more , " he replied . Nervously he glanced back the way they had come . " What your father is doing is wrong . He usurps the rights of King Kelson . " " Kelson ? " Sidana hiccoughed and tried to stop her sobbing . " What obedience do you owe him ? " " I am the heir of Transha , " Dhugal replied . " My father is King Kelson'sliegeman . " " Your father is his liegeman . You have sworn no oaths . " " Have I not ? " " Well , you are free to give your allegiance where you will , " she said , staring up at him with great , accusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family 's blood joined to Meara 's ? Your uncle is my father , and the father of future kings . My brother will someday rule a reunited Meara . You could have been a part of it  --  would have been a part of it . Father had promised you a dukedom ! " Sadly Dhugal shook his head . " Only my king may give me that , Lady , " he said , standing to rest his hand on the bridle of the bay . " And it is not your brother who shall rule a reunited Meara , but mine . " " But  --  I thought you had no brothers . " He shrugged and smiled . " None yet live who were born of my mother  --  but I have a brother , fair cousin : a brother of blood , to whom I owe total allegiance ; one worth forfeiting my very soul to protect and serve  --  which I may have done , by breaking my oath in escape , and taking you with me . " He sighed . " But having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all by being taken now , " he said , offering his hand to help her rise . " Your hand , please , my lady , " he added , when she drew back in protest . " Do n't force me to add another offense to the litany of my crimes . Despite what you may think , I was taught to honor and revere women . " Rebellion and indignation flared again in her dark eyes , but Sidana was too much the daughter of nobility not to recognize an untenable position . Spurning his offer of assistance , she gathered the shreds of her pride around her with the fur-lined cloak she wore and wobbled to her feet , though she did allow him to lift her onto the sorrel 's saddle . She sat woodenly as he scrambled up behind her and reached around her to gather up the reins . A moment to retrieve the sword set upright in the snow , and then hep153set heels to their mount and urged it forward , glancing back over his shoulder at the dark specks of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but gradually fell behind and was lost as the sorrel settled into a modest but steady pace . They managed to keep moving for another hour , until the shadows were long and weak on the virgin snow of the C'uilteine Road , but their horse was nearly spent as Dhugal drew rein at the top of a rise and turned to look back . Their pursuers could be discerned as three or four score horsemen now , drawing inexorably nearer . Sidana stirred in his arms and gazed after him , the wind whipping a tendril of her dark hair against his face . " My father will kill you , " she said softly , not turning her head . " After my brothers finish with you . " A tightness spreading beneath his aching ribs , Dhugal swallowed and shifted his gaze in the direction they had been fleeing  --  toward Gwynedd , and safety . They would never reach it now . Their horse would be lucky to make it down the hill , much less carry them beyond . And whether or not Dhugal were calloused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him  --  and even if he followed through  --  they would kill him for what he had done . Whether quickly or painfully hardly mattered , under the circumstances . Dead was dead . But as his eyes darted longingly back toward the east and safety , he caught a trace of unexpected movement : more horsemen approaching , perhaps even more than pursued him . He drew in breath sharply as he strained his eyes in that direction , for they could not be Sicard 's men , and have ridden fast enough to circle round this way . But if not Sicard 's , then it mattered little whose they were . Anyone was preferable to being taken by the Mearans . He did not pause to analyze it further . Setting his heels to their tremblingmount , he forced it down the hill , holding Sidana close against him as the animal stumbled and lurched , near to foundering . He might still die . He might break his neck falling from this fool horse , if it did n't watch where it was putting its feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the ones behind . But he was not going to wait for the Mearans to take him.  |p154All  the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border : the men that were at peacewith thee have deceived thee , and prevailedagainst thee  --  Obadiah 1:7 " Uh-oh , we have company , " Kelson murmured . He reined back to a walk and stood in his stirrups for a better look , pointing at a snowy ridge far ahead where a mounted horse had just appeared , silhouetted against the twilight sky . " D' you see him ? " Morgan , with a curt signal to halt the column of knights riding four abreast behind them , also drew rein and peered into the distance , casting about with other senses than sight , lest the rider not be alone . " Aye , and he 's undoubtedly seen us by now as well , " he replied . " So much for approaching Ratharkin unob  --  what the  --  ? " He broke off in astonishment as the horse suddenly broke from the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ponderouslurch threatening to send both rider and steed tumbling . " Is he trying to break his neck ? " Kelson gasped . The horse stumbled and nearly went down even as Kelson spoke , then suddenly both he and Morgan saw the reason for at least a part of the animal 's labor . " He 's carrying double ! " Kelson exclaimed in amazement . " Aye , and to be riding double at that speed and on a horse that spent , the Devil himself must be chasing them , " Morgan agreed . " Care to give the Devil some sport , Sire ? " Kelson raised an eyebrow at the borderline blasphemy , but he needed no second invitation . He had been spoiling for just such a skirmish all day . With a grin which had nothing to do with mirth , he unsheathed his sword and raised it over his head , glancing back to where Conall was already shaking out the folds of the Haldane battle standard.  | " Forward at the canter and fan out ! " he ordered , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chasing that fellow is going to have a surprise , I think ! " Immediately Conall and Saer de Traherne spurred forward and to Kelson 's left , folds of scarlet silk billowing on the wind as the battle standard unfurled . Jodrell led another detachment to the right . The deadly hiss of steel slithering from scabbards joined the jingle of bits and spurs and the creak of leather as the knights broadened their line , outridersspurring ahead on the flanks . They were nearing the start of the hillrise now , the fleeing horse nearly upon them  --  close enough for Morganto see that the front rider on the horse was a girl , dark hair whipping in the wind . And the other " It 's Dhugal ! " Kelson cried , even as the other rider 's arm flailed in a frenzied wave of recognition . Dhugal was in their midst then , laughing aloud despite his exhaustion , Kelson and Morgan reining in to bracket his faltering mount as the rest of the warband swept on up the hill . Morgan caught the horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his own mount scrambling for footing as the sorrel staggered and nearly fell . " Steady ! " " Here , take her ! " Dhugal gasped , helping lift his protesting companion to a new perch in front of Morgan 's saddle . " She 's Sidana , the pretender 's daughter . Her father 's men are right behind me . " " How many ? " Kelson demanded , as he gave Dhugal a hand up behind him . Dhugal hooked a hand in the back of Kelson 's belt to steady himself and shook his head happily . " Not enough to give your men any trouble , Sire . Am I ever glad to see you ! " " And I. " Kelson wheeled his stallion on its haunches and glanced after his knights nearing the crest of the hill . " But let 's make sure you counted correctly . Morgan , stay out of the fighting unless we 're needed , but come along with me . Oh , and welcome to Gwynedd , my lady ! " Morgan felt the girl stiffen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only shifted her closer into the curve of his shield arm as he urged his horse up the hill after the king , naked sword still ready in his gloved right hand . Ahead of them , the warband spilled over the crest of the hill with shouts of glee . He could hear the answering cries of consternation as Dhugal 's pursuers saw the Haldane standard in the midst of their attackers . The sortie was all but over by the time Morgan drew rein at the top ofp156the hill with Kelson . Down on the plain , a handful of Haldane knights were in pursuit of a few stragglers , but the rest of the opposition were on the run far ahead . Several men unhorsed in the encounter were scattered down the other side of the hill , picking themselves up shakily , but none of them wore Kelson 's livery . Haldane knights stood guard over each one , Traherne and Conall marching another one back to join his fellows while the squires rounded up all the loose horses . A cheer went up from Kelson'sknights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal the battle horn sounded to call back their knights still in pursuit . Grinning , Morganurged his horse after the king 's . " A happy circumstance , Sire , " he said as they drew abreast at the bottom of the hill and halted , glancing down in amusement at the girl now beginning to wriggle in his arms as he reached around her to sheathe his sword . " And a rich prize young Dhugal has brought us , too . There 's no point in struggling , my lady . You 'd best save your strength for the ride back to Rhemuth . " " My father will avenge me ! " Sidana cried . " You took him by surprise . " " But , that 's the whole point , is n't it , my lady ? " Kelson asked with a grin . " To take the enemy by surprise ? I would be a poor commander if I sent my men into battle in rebel territory without the best possible advantage . Your father would have done the same . " " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He seeks to restore my mother to the throne which is rightfully hers , and to give Meara back its freedom . We shall not be ruled by  --  by a Deryni heretic ! " The taunt was only an accustomed annoyance to Morgan , inured from childhood to ignore such affronts , but Kelson reacted as if he had been stung , apparently not expecting it from a beautiful young girl . Dhugal , sitting behind the king , could not see how the grey eyes flashed warning , but he obviously sensed the sudden tension before Kelson brought his anger under control . Even Sidana gasped as she realized what she had said , and to whom , and in whose arms . Morgan forced himself not to react , waiting to see how Kelson would handle this . " In future , my lady , I should take better care for my choice of words , " the king finally said , after permitting himself a careful sigh . " If the fact that we are Deryni is abhorrent to you , then you should be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true  --  and we are not made of stone . Do not press our forbearance too far . " He glanced purposefully out at his returning knights for a few seconds , temporarily releasing Sidana from the intensity of his gaze , but the brief respite did nothing to reassure the girl , trembling in Morgan 's arms like a sparrow in the clutches of a bird of prey . Dhugal 's stiff carriage pro/claimed him still stunned as well by the tight-leashed power he sensed in the man suddenly stranger sitting in front of him  --  even if Morgan had not been able to sense the fear behind the shields Dhugal should not have had . Kelson 's expression was far more mild when he at last looked back at them , but Sidana still recoiled . " You will not be harmed , my lady , " Kelson murmured . " By my honor and my crown , I swear it . If my earlier words seemed harsh , I apologize , but we have ridden long and hard and I had not thought to have so gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , but neither can I let you go . Now you must pardon me while I see to my men . " He turned his stallion down the slope toward the skirmish site without waiting for reply , white horse stark against the trampled snow , Dhugal shifting his grip from Kelson 's belt to the horse 's crupper behind him as the animal lurched down the slope . Morgan followed more slowly with the subdued Sidana , still pondering Kelson 's reaction . Dhugal 's Mearan pursuers had not wholly abandoned the situation , Morgan saw , as he scanned the darkening plain before them . They milled in a tight knot a few hundred yards out , obviously trying to decide what to do next . Between them and the skirmish site , most of Kelson 's knights sat their horses in a long single line , ready to repel any renewed attack . Behind the line , the remaining Haldane riders kept watch over the prisoners : six in all  --  four now standing bunched before Traherne and Conall , hands bound behind them , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heavily armored , and several wore only court attire  --  no armor at all . " Did you interrupt some festive occasion , Dhugal ? " Kelson asked over his shoulder , as they approached Traherne and Conall . Dhugal grimaced , leaning around the king to inspect the captives as they drew rein . " They would call it so , Sire . Archbishop Loris consecrated Judhael of Meara Bishop of Ratharkin this morning . And I suppose you 've guessed they have Bishop Istelyn to prisoner . " His face lit with surprise and then pleasure as he got a good look at the sullen young man standing closest to Conall 's horse , hands bound behind and a rope halter running from his neck to Conall 's hands . " Well , fancy that ! " " Someone you know ? " Morgan asked , feeling Sidana 's silent gasp of horror . Dhugal laughed and clapped Kelson on the shoulder , his earlier uneasinessapparently past . " Know him ? Aye , indeed , Your Grace . Oh , this is rare luck . Sire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Llewell of Meara , the younger of this lady 's brothers . " He gestured grandly in her direction . " Well done , Conan . Did you capture him ? " Conall drew himself up importantly , uncertain whether to be more pleased at the status of his prize or annoyed at Dhugal 's omission of his proper title , " Of course I did . Llewell of Meara , you say ? " he repeated , prodding disdainfully at Llewell 's back with a booted toe . Llewell bore the affront without physical resistance , but his brown eyes blazed as he twisted to glare up at Conall . " You never would have taken me if my girth had n't slipped , " he said hotly . " My father will return for us ! " " Yes , under a parley flag , " Kelson retorted , directing their attention to the party heading toward his line . " Hardly a dashing rescue mission , I think , but we 'll hear what they have to say . " Sick at heart , Llewell whirled to crane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done nothing wrong , " he said desperately . " You have no right to hold us ! " " Have I not ? " Kelson leaned his forearms casually on the high pommelof his saddle . " And what should I do with subjects who defy my laws and usurp my authority in my own lands ? " " But ours is the better claim , " Llewell began . " Our line comes from  --  " " I know all about the line from which you spring , " Kelson interrupted . " The matter was settled nearly a hundred years ago . " He glanced up at the squire riding back from the defending Haldane line , the knot of Mearan riders slowly approaching under a white flag , then stood in his stirrups and shaded his eyes to peer farther out on the darkening plain . " I see them , " Morgan said , noting the numbers of the torches another approaching body bore , perhaps half an hour 's hard ride away . " Sicard 's reinforcements . We 'd best make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kelson kneed his horse over to the new mount another squire was bringing up for Dhugal and helped him shift across . " Llewell , I 'll oblige your father for a few minutes , but I think you can see why I do n't intend to stay around . Jodrell , prepare the men to ride out as soon as we 've parleyed . Conall , we 'll need a horse for your prisoner as well . And Morgan  --  bring the girl partway . They may be more inclined to reason if they see she 's safe . " Torches hastily lit sputtered in the falling snow as they rode out . Kelsonand Dhugal led , Sidana still sitting stiff and frightened before the silent Morgan , half a length behind . Conan and Traherne flanked thep159mounted Llewell , with an escort of four knights behind . Among the dozen riders who approached from the Mearan side , Dhugal identified Sicard MacArdry and his son Ithel in the lead . All but the four principals drew rein within hearing distance of a central point between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stopped a horse-length apart . " I have never done you any harm , Sicard MacArdry , " Kelson said quietly . " Why have you broken faith with me ? " Sicard turned a cold , disdainful look on Dhugal , holding a torch beside the king , then glanced back at Kelson . " I never swore you any oaths , Kelson of Gwynedd . My young kinsman , on the other hand , betrayed his blood and broke oaths sworn on holy relics , before many witnesses . Do not speak to me of faith with an oath-breaker sitting at your side as counsel . " " He serves far older faith than oaths sworn under duress , " Kelson answered . " But I think you did not come to argue my Lord Dhugal 's shortcomings , if such they are . I assume you wished to verify your children'ssafety . As you can see , they have not been harmed . " Sicard 's tight-lipped glance flicked to his son , anxious but hopeful in his bonds between Conall and Traherne , then more briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Haldane , " he muttered , forcing himself not to look at them again . Kelson inclined his head gracefully . " A father could not want otherwise , my lord . And that is easily arranged . I have no quarrel with chil-dren . " " And the price ? " Sicard asked . " For a beginning , the return of my bishop , Henry Istelyn . " " I do not have him . " " Not with you , no . But you can get him . " Sicard shook his head . " He is Loris ' hostage , not mine . " " Loris ' treason is old . I do not hold you answerable for that . Your treason is more recent , and might be forgiven if I received sufficient surety of your future loyalty . If Istelyn is returned unharmed and you deliver Loris into my hands , I would be willing to discuss a general amnesty for all your family . " " You would never do that ! " " I have said that I would . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never see your children again . And in the spring , I shall lead an army into Meara and scour the land until I have found you , your wife ,  |p160and  every other living member of the Mearan royal house and put them to the sword . " " You would never do that ! " Sicard gasped . " Do you wish to test that belief ? " Kelson countered . " If , on the other hand , you present yourself , your lady wife , and the rest of your family before my court by Christmas , delivering the traitor Loris and his supportersinto my hands and pledging your true homage as dutiful vassals of my crown , then this all may be resolved most happily for all con-cerned . " " Those are no terms at all ! " Sicard said with a contemptuous spit into the snow beside him . " You must take me for an idiot ! No sane man would agree to that . " " Then perhaps you had best go a little mad , Sicard ! " Kelson retorted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . " And I should be mad if I remained to debate the issue with you . I did not expect you to give me your answer without more sober reflection . " " But what of my children ? " " You have a fortnight to tell me what will become of them , " Kelson replied , gathering up his reins in preparation to leave . " I must have your decision by Christmas Court . In the meantime , I give you my word that they shall not be harmed  --  and I trust you will make me the same assurancesregarding Bishop Istelyn . " " I told you , that is not within my power . . . " Then find a way to make it so ! " " I can not ! " " A fortnight ! " Kelson repeated . And as he and Dhugal wheeled their horses and started back , the Haldane line edged forward , curtailing any thought Sicard might have entertained of following after . With a glance backward at the approaching reinforcements , still a quarter-hour too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , longing glance at his son and daughter being drawn back among their captors , then reined his mount around and rode off at the gallop with his remaining son . Llewell took the turn of events stoically enough , only bowing his head and biting back a sob as father and brother receded into the dusk and the nearer torches moved off ; but Sidana burst into distraught weeping . " No ! They ca n't leave us ! " she gasped , struggling to wiggle from Morgan'sgrasp . " Father ! Father , come back ! " The attempt was futile , of course , but a hysterical woman was the last thing Morgan wanted on his hands if they were going to have to make a run for it . Pulling off his right glove with his teeth while he restrained her in his shield arm , he caught Kelson 's eye and communicated his inten/tion . Kelson agreed . Pinning the struggling girl firmly against his mailcladchest , Morgan pressed his hand over her eyes and willed her to sleep . Immediately , she went boneless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What have you done ? " Llewell gasped . He wrenched at his bound wrists helplessly as he tried to kick his horse closer to see . " Oh , God , what have you done to her ? " " She 's not been hurt ; he 's only made her sleep , " Kelson said sharply , plunging his horse between Llewell 's and Morgan 's to seize Llewell by the shoulder . " And if you keep your head , I 'll not use on you what 's been used on her . " " Was it magic ? " Llewell managed to whisper around an almost tearful gulp . " No , but I have n't the time to explain the distinction just now . Agree to cooperate , and I 'll even have them bind your hands more comfortably . It 's a long ride to Rhemuth with your hands tied behind you . " " You 'll pay for this , " Llewell muttered through clenched teeth . " May your Deryni soul rot in Hell ! " " You 're about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't push me . If you believe me damned already , then it follows that I have nothing to gain by personal restraint  --  though despite your belief , it is my intention to deal with you as honorably as possible . Now , is this to be easy or difficult ? " Llewell maintained his glare of tearful defiance for a few seconds , measuring it against Kelson 's calm , passionless gaze , then broke the contactand bowed his head , shoulders slumping dejectedly . " I can not stand against a demon , " he whispered . " I am not fool enough to seek my death deliberately . " " Nor I , " Kelson replied . " Conall , see to his hands , but keep a close guard on him . " With another glance at the approaching Mearan force , he reined his horse around and raised a gloved fist in signal . " ' T is time we made a tactical withdrawal , my lords ! " he shouted , to answering shouts of approval from his men . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now we return to Rhemuth ! " Thus did they ride from the plain of Ratharkin , richer for two royal prisoners and a rescued earl , Dhugal not yet aware that he was poorer by a father . Darkness and the increasingly heavy snowfall soon enabled them to elude the pursuing Mearan host ; and when human and Deryni senses confirmed that they were out of danger , Kelson allowed a brief stop to rest . Only then did he draw Dhugal a little aside and tell himp162about old Caulay , giving what meager comfort he could as he shared Dhugal 's grief at the news of the old earl 's death . Grief and futile comfort were served up in full measure that night in . Ratharkin as well , when the desolate Sicard returned without daughter , forsworn nephew , or second son . Caitrin and Judhael heard his halting report in stunned silence , Judhael lamely holding his aunt 's hand but unable to give a word of reassurance . " How could the Haldane have known to be there just then ? " Caitrin whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul , wicked sorcery ! And he has my babes to hostage . " " We were wrong to trust young Dhugal , " Judhael muttered . " To betrayhis own kin  --  but who could have guessed he would break his sworn word , given on holy relics ? He is damned , damned . . . . " " I should have struck him to the heart with my own dagger when first I saw him , " the miserable Sicard whispered . " I should have known my brother would poison him against us after all these years . And my son .. my little girl . . . in the hands of Deryni ! " They sent for Loris and Creoda a little later , when they had recovered some of their composure and reviewed the terms of Kelson 's demands . By the time Sicard had repeated his account for their benefit , Loris was all but foaming at the mouth . " He offered you amnesty if you would abandon me ? " he raged . " He dared to demand Istelyn 's release ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he can threaten us ! " " He does think he can , " Caitrin replied irritably . " What is more , he has done a very credible job of it . I would be naive in the extreme if I thought he expected us to accept his offer , but he almost had to make the attempt . Still , we are not without our own resources . Nephew , please have Bishop Istelyn brought to us . " " He is still my prisoner , not yours , Lady , " Loris warned . " I am quite aware of that . I wish to question him . See to it , Judhael . " Loris let him leave to do her bidding , but he continued to rant and mutter under his breath all the while Judhael was gone , hardly touching the wine which Ithel poured to bolster all their courage . " God curse the Deryni ! " Loris spat , as Judhael brought Istelyn in a short time later . " Curse the Deryni king who pretends piety and honor and continues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would keep counsel with him ! " he added , glaring at Istelyn . " You are no better than the Haldane you serve , Istelyn . I should have you executed as the traitor you are ! "  | " There will be no executions in this city without my leave , Archbishop , " Caitrin said mildly , as she signed for a stool to be brought for Istelyn . " A dead bishop is hardly a strong bargaining point . The Haldane wants him back unharmed . By the same token , he will not harm the children so long as he believes we are willing to negotiate . Negotiations could drag on until the spring . " " You credit him with too much honor , Madame , " Loris said . " These Deryni are treacherous . Kelson is most treacherous of all . " " He is still hardly more than a boy , " Sicard said contemptuously . " Children do not kill children . " " Do not underestimate him , my lord , " Loris replied . " I did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is a man , with all a man 's cunning and treachery increased because he is Deryni . " He paused a beat . " And given that he is a man , has it not occurred to you that he may have a man 's appetites  --  he who now has your daughter in his power ? " Caitrin pursed her lips tightly together , saying nothing , but Sicard 's knuckles whitened on the arms of his chair . " If he touches her  --  " " Of course , he might marry her , " Loris continued , watching Sicard 's reaction especially and choosing his words . " That would confirm his claim to the Mearan throne after he eliminated the rest of you . Union of the two crowns  --  the same logic that his great-grandfather used with your great-grandmother , Your Highness . Then again , he might simply use her and cast her aside  --  or let his men have her , once he had done . Such things  --  " " I do n't want to hear it ! " Sicard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loris went on relentlessly . " He 's a pretty boy . Soldiers sometimes  --  " " Stop it ! " Uncurling his fingers from their deathgrip on his chair arms , Sicard took his wife 's near hand blindly in his while he lifted his cup and drained it with a single-minded deliberation . Caitrin winced at the pressure of his hand , but she kept stony silence . When Sicard had done , he set the cup aside and drew deep breath before looking back at Loris accusingly . " That last was a low blow , Archbishop . " Loris shrugged . " Then I apologize for it . The danger to Sidana , how-ever  --  " " I am her father , Archbishop ! " Sicard snapped . " Can you imagine that particular fear has been far from my thoughts these many hours ? When Ip164saw the cursed Haldane sitting his great white horse , young and hotbloodedand proud , and his Deryni henchman with his arms around  --  " " Sicard  --  no ! " Caitrin said . " Do n't do this to yourself Sidana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way . " " Then , we must show the Haldane whelp that we mean business , Highness-and that we do not intend to be intimidated , " Loris purred . Jerkily Sicard took up his cup again and held it out for Ithel to pour him more wine , letting Caitrin soothe him with little caresses stroked along his shoulder . She was looking at Istelyn rather than her husband , however . The bishop had done his best to be invisible while his captors argued , but now he could not escape her scrutiny . Dark circles smudged the fine-drawn skin beneath his eyes , but he appeared to have recovered from the drug given him earlier in the day . As Sicard tossed off half his new cup of wine , Caitrin returned her attention to Loris . A new determinationappeared to have stamped itself on her plain features . " Indeed , we are not intimidated , Archbishop , " she said quietly . " My love for my children is no less than my husband 's , but the brutal fact of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the possible consequences of supporting our claim to the throne . If God wills that they should die at a tyrant 's hands , then I must pray that they be granted the grace to endure it with all the dignity of their royal blood . It is as a queen as well as a mother that I speak these harsh words . With God 's help , none of us shall have to make the sacrifice . " She rose to begin slowly pacing the space between her chair and the room 's fireplace , playing with the rings on her slender hands . " As a queen , however , it occurs to me that our young Deryni king may have made a great tactical error when he let us know he wants Bishop Istelyn back . He threatens reprisals if we do not submit by Christmas , but so long as he thinks we are considering his terms , I doubt he will actually do the children harm . For all that he is Deryni , he seems to prefer not to shed blood if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all winter , as I said before . Long enough to ensure that we have all the support we need to meet and defeat him in the spring . " ' Winter itself will give us the time we need to build our strength for the spring campaign , " Loris said stubbornly . " We do not need to bargain with Deryni , Madame . " " Mother , may I speak ? " Ithel interjected . Regally Caitrin inclined her head . " Thank you . " Ithel came to stand beside his mother 's empty chair , one hand on its back as he gazed at Loris.  | " Archbishop , as my mother 's heir , I stand to gain a great deal if we are successful against the Haldane , but I hope you will understand that I would prefer that my brother and sister were still alive to share our victory when it eventually comes . To that end , I should like to point out a few practical considerations of tactics and politics which may have escapedyour notice . " " Do n't lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , Archbishop  --  any more than Kelson is a boy , " Ithel retorted , but coolly , and without raising his voice . " I 'm a prince and I 'll thank you to address me as such . Has n't it occurred to you that even if it is n't possible for Kelson to mount an actual campaign during the winter , he could still harass the lowland regions enough to interfere with the raising of our levies ? But he 'll not take drastic action so long as we 're negotiating . " " You have a lot to learn about politics , boy , " Loris replied coldly . " And about Deryni . How can you even contemplate giving him the satis-faction  --  " Sicard cleared his throat dangerously . " My son is a realist , Archbishop . His mother and I have brought him up that way . And speaking as a realist , I know that there is nothing we can do to protect Sidana and Llewell if the Haldane decides not to keep his word . But by the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Christmas deadline , even the lowlands will be all but inaccessible to large bodies of troops from outside Meara . As long as we pretend to be considering his terms , they will be safe  --  and so will our borderlands . " " Neither the children nor the land will ever be safe while Kelson lives , " Loris said stubbornly . " He regards the land as his  --  and he must eventually kill you and your heirs or else keep you in perpetual imprisonment , as he tried to do to me . He would be a fool to let you live , lest potential rebellion always hang above his head . He will use the children as bait to lure you to your destruction . " " Then let him think he will succeed , " Caitrin retorted . " Talk is cheap . Perhaps we can tantalize him with the hope of Istelyn 's return , since he seems to care for the man 's safety . Now that Judhael has been consecrated , Istelyn is of little use to us here . " Loris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye . Any worthy priest would have informed his superiors that one under his charge intended to break a sacred oath . Istelyn , I hold you personally responsible for young Dhugal 's escape . " Istelyn , notably grim and silent until then , shook his head . " I honestly regret that I can not take credit for that , " he said softly  | " As for his oath-breaking , I suspect there are far worse offenses before God than the breaking of an oath taken under duress . Perhaps you have knowledge of a few of them . " Loris ' eyes lit dangerously . " As for my worthiness as a priest , " Istelyn went on , " you have no authority to judge that  --  and have had none since the bishops removed you from office and sent you into confinement . " As much from reflex as volition , Loris was on his feet and raising his hand to strike the defiant Istelyn , a wordless growl rumbling in his throat , careless of the goblet which toppled from his chair arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caitrin gasped , as Sicard simultaneously launched himself between the two to block the intended blow . The word and the sound of shattering pottery served to deflate Loris ' blind fury , and he drew himself up indignantly before Sicard could touch him , pointedly dropping his hands to his sides and inclining his head in a grudging bow to Caitrin as he seated himself once more . Sicard , with an explosive sigh , tugged his tunic into place and also sat . Ithel , who had moved to his father 's defense , warily resumed his place behind his mother'schair . Judhael clasped his hands tightly before him and tried not to look torn between loyalty to his aunt and obedience to the man who had made him a bishop . Istelyn had never moved from his stool or flinched throughout the interchange . " Please accept my apologies , Your Highness , " Loris murmured contritely . " I do n't know what came over me . His insolence is  --  unbecoming in a priest . " " Indeed , it is , " Caitrin replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior in quite that light . Be that as it may , the Haldane will need some reassurance of Istelyn 's well-being . His ring , I think  --  and perhaps a letter from his hand , which you shall dictate , Archbishop . " " I will not write it , " Istelyn said quietly . " And if he will not cooperate , " Caitrin continued , her face hardening , " I shall leave it to you , Archbishop , to decide what measures should be taken to assure the king that we have his bishop and will deal with him as he intends to deal with my children , if agreement can not be reached . " She smiled grimly at Loris . " I shall ask my nephew to assist you , and rely on your joint good offices to see that our intention is carried out . " Loris nodded slowly , a grim smile coming across his face . " Very well , Madame . I will be quite pleased to carry out your wishes . I think you will not be disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captivity .  --  Nahum 3:10A weary but satisfied Kelson led his warband back through the gates of Rhemuth less than a week after his departure , none of his men with so much as a scratch , Dhugal 's presence at his side proclaiming at least the partial success of his mission . As the column clattered across the bridge and into the castle yard , several elated Transha bordermen darted out to greet their new young chief with raucous highland yells . Dhugal 's previousinjuries had been aggravated by his escape and the enforced march of the past three days , but he managed a grin and a few words for each man before sliding painfully from his horse . Nor was Dhugal the only addition to Kelson 's company . Six glum prisoners rode with the warband ; the youngest , a dark-haired , aristocratic-lookingboy , was doing his best to put up a brave front , his wrists bound before him and his horse 's lead secured to Conall 's saddle . His cheeks flamed with embarrassment under the stares of the curious , but he kept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his horse . The most intriguing addition of all sat limply in the circle of Morgan 's arms , apparently asleep  --  a heavily cloaked female form with tangled chestnut hair escaping from beneath her hood . " They 're the pretender 's younger children , " Kelson told Nigel , as he dismounted in the snowy courtyard and helped Morgan hand the sleepinggirl into Duncan 's arms . " Now all we need are Caitrin , Sicard , and the remaining son . And Loris , of course . The girl 's name is Sidana . Dhugalstole her out from under their noses . " " She is n't hurt , is she ? " Nigel asked . Morgan , relieved of his burden , swung one leg over his horse 's neck and vaulted to the ground , shaking his head.  | " She 'll be fine by morning . I  --  ah  --  had to put her to sleep . She started to get hysterical when she realized she was n't going to be rescued . I doubt she 'll even remember most of the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his powers without batting an eye . " Aye , that was probably kindest . Duncan , why do n't you take her to my wife ? Unless you wish otherwise , of course , Kelson . She 'll want the comfort of another woman 's company when she wakes  --  and a lady 's bower seems a more fitting setting for this Mearan rose than a cell . " " A briar rose , I think , " Kelson said , smiling , " with proper thorns , I 'll warrant . But no matter . Aunt Meraude will be a suitable companion , I 'm sure . Father Duncan , would you take her , please ? " " Of course . " " And as for our other unexpected guest , " Kelson went on , with a glance back at the sullen Llewell as Duncan withdrew , " you 'll be proud to learn that it was your son Conall , who captured him , Uncle . His name is Llewell . He 's been a little belligerent from the start , so I think he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a noble hostage , not a criminal . " Kelson took a few more minutes seeing to the disposition of his other prisoners and to the provisioning of his men and horses , then went with Dhugal and Morgan into the hall . While all three of them washed down mouthfuls of venison pasties with mulled ale , he gave a hastily gathered privy council his impromptu account of the venture . Dhugal was beginning to nod over his food by the time they finished , and even Morgan was beginning to slow down as food filled empty stomachs and ale lulled aching muscles . Within the hour , after scheduling a formal meeting of the full council for the following afternoon , Kelson dismissed the court and retired for the night . The torches in Rhemuth hall burned late that night as Nigel and the others tried to digest what the king had told them . Kelson woke with the dawn , however  --  not yet fully refreshed , but unable to sleep longer . He felt the need to do something , but there was nothing he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window and watched the snow fall for a while , hoping he might ease himself back into drowsiness , but he only grew more restless . After a while he gave up the notion of sleep and got dressed , pulling on plain grey breeches , boots , tunic , and fur-lined overrobe . Like a silent ghost he prowled the precincts of his castle , inquiring after the men and horses that had returned with him from Ratharkin , checking on his prisoners and hostages , and breaking his fast with Morgan , who was also unable to sleep into the day . When he returned to hisp169own apartments a few hours later , still on edge , he found Dhugal also awake and dressed , wondering where he had gone . " I could n't sleep , " Kelson told him . " I talked to Morgan , but that did n't seem to help much . I thought I might pay a visit to my father 's tomb before the council meeting . Sometimes doing so helps me clear my head  --  almost as if I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " They chose the most common-looking horses they could find in the royal stables , for Kelson did not want his going to be noticed . Cloaked and closely capped , as much for anonymity as for warmth , they rode the half mile to the cathedral along silent , nearly deserted streets and alleys . The weather held cold and clear ; the snow was still mostly white from the previous night when they dismounted in the cathedral yard . Their breath fogged on the air before them as they made their way through a slype to skirt the northern side of the cloister garth , Kelson bounding up steps to a side door , Dhugal hobbling a little stiffly from the still-painful bruise on his thigh . " I used to hate this place , " Kelson said as he led the way down the south aisle . " The royal crypt , I mean . Archbishop Cardiel has done a lot to make it more bearable in the two years he 's had the cathedral , but it 's still a little creepy . Did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , I do n't remember . " " You 'd remember . " Kelson paused to open a high , gilded brass gate far enough for himself and Dhugal to slip through , then pulled it to behind them . " I suppose the best part about it is that it 's one place where I can almost always be sure I 'll not be disturbed , " he continued . " Such places are rare when one is king . " Dhugal allowed himself a noncommittal grunt as they followed the corridor around a left-hand turn and started down a flight of marble steps , hanging back to ease his aching leg . By the time he reached the bottom , he found Kelson already kneeling beside an ornately carved sepulcher , head bowed in prayer ; so he eased himself to a sitting position on the lowest step and breathed a prayer for his own father 's soul . When he finished , he glanced around the dimly lit chamber , noting the rows of stone sarcophagi and the smooth marble of the walls . The stylized stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stiff , very little like the King Brion whom Dhugal remembered . " I suppose this is the way most people will remember him , " Kelson remarked , when he had crossed himself and stood to glance back at Dhugal , one hand lingering on the stone king 's hand . " The stern Lord of Justice , who kept the peace for nearly fifteen years . " He sighed andp170glanced at his feet . " It is n't the way I like to think of him , though . My father laughed a lot , but King Brion  --  well , he did what he had to do , as king . Kings do n't get to laugh as much as ordinary folk . That 's but one of the things I 've learned in these three years I 've worn the crown . " Dhugal nodded and glanced around the subterranean chapel again with idle interest , remembering the old king 's kindness to a confused young page of eight , still fresh from the less sophisticated ways of his father 's highland hall . Like many eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had been intermittent , with disastrous results the first time he was required to serve the high table . Only the king had refrained from laughing when Dhugal tripped and sent a tray of steaming pheasants and gravy skittering and sloshing down the steps of the royal dais . The memory merged with recollections of old Caulay seated in the hall at Transha , training his own fosterlings with the same sort of firm but loving discipline that Dhugal had enjoyed at Brion 's court , and Dhugal started to smile . The smile faded as he glanced again at Brion 's effigy , however ; for the man at Transha was only newly dead , and the shock of his passing was unnumbed by the passage of years . Dhugal could feel thetears threatening to well up in his eyes , despite the fact that , in some ways , old Caulay 's death still seemed quite unreal . " It 's all right to miss him , you know , " Kelson said softly , reading his mood , if not his thought . " I still miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it happened , too . And sometimes late at night , when I 'm feeling especially alone and burdened , I still cry . " Dhugal had all he could do to swallow , not daring to look at Kelson lest he loose a whole floodgate of ill-timed grief . He focused on one of the torches burning in a brass cresset instead , forcing himself to raise his eyesto the chapel 's vaulting . " This is n't such a creepy place , " he managed to say , in an awkward attempt to change the subject . " It 's rather nice , actually . " Kelson gave him a sympathetic smile , well aware what his foster brother was trying to do and hardly blaming him . " It 's only been this way the past year or so . All the stone facing on the walls is new . " He gestured casually toward the nearest stretch of burnished marble as he moved toward it . The slap of his open palm against the stone made Dhugal start . " There are tomb niches carved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It used to be that only kings and queens were buried in free-standing tombs like my father 's . Other members of the royal family were simply wrapped in their shrouds and laid to rest on the shelves in these walls.  |p171They  did n't rot for some reason ; they just dried out and eventually crumbledaway  --  something about the air , I 'm told . I 'd hold tight to my mother'shand and hide my eyes when my parents brought me here to pray on feast days . The fellow behind this wall , in particular , used to scare me half to death . " Ready to seize on any topic in preference to his own grief , Dhugal rose to approach the panel Kelson was touching . " Dolonus Haldanus , Princeps Gwyneddis , 675-699 , " Dhugal read , stumbling a little over the fine , archaic script . " Filius Llarici , Rigonus Gwyneddis . Requiem in pacem . " He glanced at Kelson in question . " Prince Dolon  --  did n't his own father execute him ? " Kelson nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time that they were plotting treason . " " Were they ? " " Who knows ? " Kelson glanced at the next row of wall inscriptions . " His brother is over there . I can remember being terrified of the two headless skeletons . My nurse told me that their father had cut off their heads because they displeased him . " " What a thing to tell a child ! " Kelson grinned . " I think I 'd been especially trying that day . Still , it was years before I gained a more objective perspective . " He glanced back at his father 's tomb wistfully . " That was n't my most frightening experience down here , though , " he went on softly , not sure whether he should risk frightening Dhugal as well by recounting the old nightmare . " It happened the night before my coronation . " " My father heard rumors .... " Dhugal said cautiously . Kelson smiled and moved back to Brion 's sarcophagus , leaning both hands along the edge . " I 'll bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details that might alarm you overmuch , but as you may know , Morgan was n't here when my father died . He was in Cardosa . " " And came back the day before the coronation , " Dhugal supplied . " That 's right . My father had been buried for over a week by then : my mother 's doing  --  she hates Morgan for being Deryni . Anyway , as I talked with him and Father Duncan that afternoon , it soon became apparentthat  --  well , something we needed to make my kingship complete had been buried with my father . " " Then you did open the tomb ! " Dhugal breathed , wide-eyed with horror . " My father said there 'd been rumors of vandals  --  " " We were n't responsible for that part , " Kelson countered . " We think
