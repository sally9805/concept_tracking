None of which is to say that Radosh and Milton are necessarily wrong in their surmises , merely that the case is not proven . And what goes for the Weinstein story goes for the other troubling circumstantial evidence Radosh and Milton produce , only more so . For every explanation of guilt there 's an equally plausible one for innocence . The " flight " of Morton Sobell and Sarant and the " disappearance " from his Paris apartment of one Joel Barr , another alleged member of the spy ring ( who is reportedly living in the Soviet Union ) , can be explained as the flight of guilty men to avoid the chair or the emigration of someone who lost his job because of politics ( Barr ) , - who took off with his neighbor 's wife ( Sarant ) or who , reading of the arrest as an " atom spy " ? of his friend Rosenberg 's brother-in-law , feared implication in a political frame-up ( Sobell ) . Al Sarant 's Morton Street apartment , the subject of countless F.B.I . memorandums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they were all members of the same spy ring and it was used for microfilming or because there was a stwar housing shortage and , like e erybody else , Communists kept their low-rent apartments in the family . The fact that Harry Gold first told the F.B.I . that he thought the password was " I come from Ben " and only later came up with " I come from Julius " may indicate a refreshed memory or a planted story . The irreconcilable dates on the Hilton Hotel registration card which the government used to corroborate Harry Gold 's story about his visit to Green-glass , may be the result of an F.B.I . forgery ( Walter Schneir and Miriam Schneir ) or Hilton incompetence ( Radosh and Milton ) . The premature destruction of this card may have been due to typical bureaucratic inertia ( Radosh and Milton ) or careful F.B.I . calculation , ( the Schneirs ) . I submit that a fair reading of the Radosh/Milton-Schneirs exchange in The New York Review of Books is a standoff . My own bias leads me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of F.B.I . materials relating to the independently discredited Elizabeth Bentley and the credibility of Gold , whose imaginary life included a nonexistent wife and children , and Greenglass , whose wife said he had a " tendency to hysteria " ( all witnesses for the prosecution at the trial ) . Also , I think the Schneirs have the better of the argument over whether another member of the alleged spy ring checked out classified materials from Columbia 's Pupin Laboratory . On the other hand , they have not persuaded me that Radosh and Milton forged documents or that the available evidence proves that the Rosenbergs were framed , any more than Radosh and Milton have persuaded me that it proves them guilty . In places where the Schneirs and Radosh and Milton cite different files to make their points , the lay reader has no way of knowing who , if anyone , is guilty of selective research , or whether the files themselves are inconsistent . The evidence , then , is inconclusive ; it cuts both ways . That 's too bad and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many reviewers and commentators are rushing to reconvict the Rosen-bergs on facts that , to use Norman Mailer 's phrase , might turn out to be merely factoids . In his own review of The Rosenberg File , in In These Times , James Weinstein writes that " since the overwhelming majority of Americans  --  if they have any knowledge of the case  --  already Assume that Julius and Ethel were guilty , " the effect of the book . . . will be to discredit the prosecutors of the Rosenbergs and certainly not to heat up the new cold war . " That would be nice , but look around . What 's stirring up the old cold warriors and the neoconservatives is not that Morris Ernst offered to serve as the Rosenbergs ' counsel so that he could fink to the F.B.I. , or that President Eisenhower denied clemency because of erroneous information he received from the Director of the F.B.I. , or that the evidence against Ethel was inconclusive , against Sobell invisible . Rather , it is that two self-advertised lefties have found the - Rosenbergs guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't so awful to have electrocuted two traitors or even to have abandoned those who defended them , and , besides , it all goes to show that you ca n't trust the Russians . Perhaps the ghost can be purged from the banquet after all . Had the Rosenbergs ' sentence been five or ten years , today we might not remember their names . Had The Rosen- , berg File come out in the 1960s , when the revisionist historians were in the saddle , its guilty verdict might not have been so quickly celebrated , its bias so easily overlooked . But we live in a period of polarization . Affirming the guilt of the Rosenbergs thirty years after the fact turns out to be a way of buying into the Zeitgeist . It is not Radosh and Milton 's fault that there is no room in a polarized culture for a split decision . But to the extent that they are intolerant of ambiguity , they have contributed to that polarization . Even if their facts are correct ( and in my view reasonable doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bungling conspirators , bush league industrial spies of misguided moral resisters against our nuclear monopoly . Instead , Radosh and Milton undermine their own material by operating from cold war assumptions which permit them to view the Rosenbergs only as instruments of calculated evil .
