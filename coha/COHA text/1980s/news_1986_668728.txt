Mario Andretti suffered minor injuries and possibly a major setback in his effort to win a second Indianapolis 500 when he crashed Wednesday during practice for the May 25 race . Andretti , the 1969 winner , suffered bruised knees and a cut to the inside of his left foot , which took several stitches to close . He was taken to Methodist Hospital , where precautionary X-rays were negative . Andretti was treated and released . A Newman-Haas Team spokesman said Andretti had been told to stay off his feet , and Dr. Henry Bock , the track medical director , said Andretti would be checked at the infield hospital Thursday before being cleared to resume driving . Andretti isn ' t expected to be back on the track until Saturday . The accident occurred during the first 30 minutes of practice . Track observers said something appeared to let go on the right rear of the car , sending Andretti ' s Lola spinning into the third-turn wall . The nose of the car was sheared away , and the right front suspension was left dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles an hour , spun 480 feet into the concrete wall . Andretti was able to climb from the car before safety crewmen arrived . The crashed car was the one Andretti qualified Saturday at 212. 300 m. p. h. , good for a second-row start . But his crew members said they would have to evaluate the car to see whether it could be repaired . If the car can ' t be repaired , Andretti could start the race in a back-up car at the rear of the 33-car field , or he could withdraw the original car and attempt to qualify the back-up . Andretti put a number of practice laps on the back-up Lola last week before qualifying , and the team spokesman said changing to that car would not present a major problem . Bob Sprow , Andretti ' s chief mechanic , said : " The race car tub is on its way to England to be repaired at Lola . We hope to get it back by next Wednesday so we can use it on carburetion day . " Sprow was referring to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain our fifth qualifying position if we use the tub we used today , " Sprow said . " As long as we don ' t change more than 49 percent of the tub , it will be considered the same one . " Andretti is no stranger to this type of situation . He also started from the back row , 33d , in 1978 , when rain washed away the first weekend of Indy time trials and Mike Hiss qualified the car at Indianapolis while Andretti raced in Belgium . Andretti wound up 12th . In 1981 , Andretti missed the first weekend of Indianapolis qualifying and his car was put into the lineup by Wally Dallenbach while Andretti was taking part in a race in Monaco . The driver change meant Andretti had to start that car from the back row , starting 32d . He finished second to Bobby Unser .

But all the action wasn ' t on the track or at the hospital . Driver Dick Simon has been fined $5 , 000 by USAC for violations during last weekend ' s qualifications . Fines of $2 , 500 each were levied against Simon ' s entry No. 22 , driven by Raul Boesel , and No. 23 , driven by Simon . The violations concerned the aperture of each car ' s popoff valves . The popoff valve controls the amount of air that reaches the engine and thus controls the amount of horsepower produced . Simon completed a qualifying run Saturday at 208. 362 m. p. h . Boesel ran a qualifying set at 209. 362 m. p. h . Both cars are expected to be allowed to make another qualifying attempt this weekend if the infractions are corrected .
