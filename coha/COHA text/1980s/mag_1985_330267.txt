Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev was in a no-nonsense mood last week as he addressed an audience of his country 's top political , industrial and &lt; scientific leaders at Communist Party headquarters a few blocks from the Kremlin . The General Secretary continued the haranguing of the slipshod Soviet economy that he has made his theme since he took office last March . This time , though , Gorbachev went a good deal further . As aging apparatchiks , most of them the appointees of the late Leonid Brezhnev , shifted uncomfortably in their seats , he singled out members of the Soviet bureaucracy by name to deliver a remarkable tongue lashing . <P> Gorbachev declared that the time had come to " literally rap inefficient executives on the knuckles . " One of the first to feel the pain was Victor Fyodorov , 73 , Petrochemical Industry Minister for the past two decades , who was taken to task for a " careless attitude . " The General Secretary noted sarcastically that Fyodorov had promised " that he would rectify his shortcomings . But evidently he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gorbachev declared , " has given instructions that the matter should be thoroughly investigated . " Few doubted that the veteran bureaucrat was being invited to consider clearing out his ministerial desk . <P> Singled out for equally harsh criticism were Iron-and-Steel Industry Minister Ivan Kazanets , 67 , in office for 20 years ; Agricultural Machine-Building Minister Konstantin Belyak , 69 , twelve years on the job ; and Building- Materials Industry Minister Alexei Yashin , 66 , appointed only six years ago . Gorbachev attacked all of them for failing to meet production quotas ( in Kazanets ' case , for the past 15 years ) while raising their departments ' budgets . Said Gorbachev : " I think we are not fellow travelers of those executives who hope to draw the country again into vast , unjustified spending . " <P> The televised speech was one of the most dramatic demonstrations yet of Gorbachev 's determination to spur the economy by using tactics advocated by his mentor , the late Yuri Andropov . Western analysts believe that the tough talk may signal a new phase in Gorbachev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own men to the ruling Politburo , Western diplomats argue , Gorbachev is now increasing the pressure on some of the remaining gerontocrats in that body to retire . Most prominent among them may be Premier Nikolai Tikhonov , 80 , who oversees all the ministers excoriated by Gorbachev . Kremlinologists noted the absence at last week 's criticism session of Politburo Member Grigory Romanov , 62 , once considered by some Western analysts as a contender for the party leadership . It was the second time recently that Romanov had failed to appear for a major Gorbachev speech . The abrasive former Leningrad party chief is officially said to be on vacation ; most Kremlin analysts consider that explanation highly unlikely .
