BALL PARK FIGURES If the current major league leaders could continue at the same pace over 162 games , 1984 would produce these record-setting or - tying stats : // STAT // PLAYER // PROJECTION // B.A. // Alan Trammell , Det . // .433 // HR // Cal Ripken , Balt . Wayne Gross , Balt. // 61 61 // RBI // Nick Esasky , Cin. // 191 // SB // Juan Samuel , Phil . // 144 // Wins // Jack Morris , Det . // 61 // ERA // Bruce Sutter , St.L. // 0.00 // Ks // Nolan Ryan , Hous. // 405 // Saves // Dan Quisenberry , K.C. Bruce Sutter , St.L. // 65 65 // New Tiger owner Tom Monaghan also owns Domino 's Pizza chain , and , before the season started , every Tiger received a blue Domino 's T shirt . The front of the shirt says : THE HOT ONES . And indeed the Tigers opened with an eight-game winning streak . Unfortunately , manager Sparky Anderson wore his T shirt during the first game and decided he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . Ah , the sweet smell of success .... Darrell Evans , the 13-year National League veteran who hit a three-run homer in his debut as a DH with the Tigers and another three-run shot in the club 's home opener , says , " The worst thing is making the last out of the inning and waiting for someone to bring your glove . It never comes . " ... By the way , National League teams have ordered their minor league affiliates to forgo the use of the designated hitter when they play one another this season . // Once upon a time , Fernando Valenzuela was an overweight phenomenon . Now he 's just another struggling pitcher with an ordinary waistline , having lost around 30 pounds since his rookie year in 1981 . He has gone 7-10 with a 4.50 ERA since last June 13 , and he 's 0-2 with a 6.75 ERA after his first three starts for the Dodgers this year . // Once upon a time , Valenzuela 's screwball was the most famous pitch in the game . It even had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a problem that wo n't go away . Even Ronald Reagan is concerned . When Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda visited the White House for a black-tie dinner last week , the Prez asked about Valenzuela. // What 's happening ? Just this : The hitters have stopped chasing those screwballs a few inches off the plate , and Valenzuela has been unable to throw the pitch consistently for strikes . When the hitters were still chasing pitches off the plate , Fernando 's ordinary fastball was an out pitch . The hitters were so preoccupied with the scroogie they could n't pull the trigger on his heater . // " He ca n't get his screwball over , " says Braves manager Joe Torre , " and the more he realizes that he ca n't get it over and that guys are taking it , the more he 'll try to aim it . " And when you try to aim the ball , when you get tentative because of a crisis in confidence , terrible things happen to your ERA. // Lasorda , Dodger pitching coach Ron Perranoski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate the problem to an inconsistent release point . According to Perranoski , " When Fernando does something wrong ; he 's dropped his arm too much . " And when that happens , he throws a scroogie that 's too fat or is taken for a ball . // It is a tribute to White Sox hitting coach Charley Lau , who died of cancer five weeks ago , that the club has temporarily replaced him with two coaches , Joe Nossek and Tommie Reynolds .... The Reds also have two hitting coaches , Tommy Helms for righthanders and Joe Sparks for lefthanders . The coaches split duties with switch hitters Ron Oester and Paul Householder. // It 's early in the season , and the Orioles stink . So what else is new ? Over the last 10 years they 've been 201-106 ( .655 ) in September-October but 86-94 ( .478 ) in April . Characteristically , they won only two of their first eight games . // Jim Palmer thinks the reason for the rough starts is the schedule  --  there just are n't enough games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storm Davis , " Palmer said last week , " and he 's the only guy on the staff who 's overpowering , and he 's the only guy pitching regularly . When you take control and location pitchers like we 've always had here , and they pitch every seven or eight days , which is what happens now , you 're going to have problems . " // Davis , who has started once and pitched middle relief three times , has allowed two runs in 17 ? innings . The rest of the Oriole pitchers have allowed 45 earned runs in 50 ? innings . // The Giants ' Manny Trillo has averaged a home run every 103 at bats in 11 major league seasons . But this year he has looked like the second coming of Rogers Hornsby , with three homers , seven RBIs and a .364 average . " Did n't surprise me , " says manager Frank Robinson . " I expected him to hit three home runs  --  for the season . " Trillo has an odd explanation for his new clout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I knew I was coming to cold weather , " he says , " and I wanted to be strong , so I decided to lift weights . " ... The Expos ' rookie outfielder , Mike Stenhouse , is the only Harvard alum in the majors . Montreal publicist Richard Griffin says , " Stenhouse calls his meal money ' accounts receivable . " ... San Diego 's Alan Wiggins volunteered to move from the outfield to second base this spring . Though the Padres are winning , Wiggins is floundering . He has committed four errors and is hitting .205 . " I 'm taking my defense into the dugout , " he says .... When Philadelphia opened at home last week , outfielder Glenn Wilson felt anything but at home . " My first night , I was real depressed , " says Wilson , who went to the Phils in the trade that sent Willie Hernandez to Detroit . " I 'm here in my home city , and I just do n't know anything  --  where to go , what to do . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , funk-lifting single in a 7-6 victory over Houston and received a thunderous ovation . How did he feel then ? " At home , " he said .... Chicago 's Gary Matthews , who was traded from Philadelphia during spring training , on becoming the Cubs ' leftfielder : " I do n't get as much beer poured on me as I did in the past . " // In his last seven seasons with Atlanta , knuckleballer Phil Niekro was 1-14 in games before April 25 . But in his first year with the Yankees , Niekro has won his first two games . Why the quick start ? To help catchers Butch Wynegar and Rick Cerone get used to the unpredictable flutters of his knuckler , Niekro threw more of them in spring training than he normally does . Niekro says the pitch is breaking now the way it usually starts to in May . // Boo who ? Perhaps Braves fans have been spoiled by their club 's early successes the past two seasons . Atlanta opened 13-0 in 1982 and 7-1 in ' 83 . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player has been spared the fans ' wrath . Two-time MVP Dale Murphy got the treatment for striking out with two outs and the bases loaded in the eighth inning of a 6-1 loss to the Mets . Shortstop Rafael Ramirez was booed that night for making three errors . Ramirez does n't mind , though . " You pay to see a good show , " he says , " and when you no like it , you go , ' Boo , that 's no good . ' " First baseman Chris Chambliss is less understanding . " I do n't agree with booing players , " he says . " Raffy gets a lot of unnecessary criticism , and , with the talent he has , he does n't deserve it . People make him out to be tight and scared , but he 's really the opposite . " // After throwing out the Red Sox ' Dwight Evans when he tried to go from first to third on a line drive to left , Seattle 's Gorman Thomas , who 's playing despite a torn rotator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope they got that throw on film . I keep waiting for a buzzard to come after my arm for dead meat . " ... In the last 3 ? months of the ' 83 season , California 's Reggie Jackson did n't have a single game in which he drove in three runs . He has two three-RBI games already in ' 84 . And while last year he had only 49 RBIs , so far this year he has 10 .... Milwaukee 's Paul Molitor has n't been able to play third because of an elbow injury that may require surgery . But he can hit . So Ted Simmons , the regular DH , is going to try third on occasion , despite having spent virtually all 14 of his years in the majors behind the plate . You 've got to like Simmons ' attitude . " If they hit it at me , " he says , " I should catch it . I 'm a ballplayer. " // Off to their best start ever , the Seattle Mariners won seven of their first 10 games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though every starter had at least one win , the Mariners ' chief strength has been their bullpen , despite the trade that sent stopper Bill Caudill to Oakland during the winter . The relief staff has averaged 2.7 appearances a game and has earned a save in every victory except one . Four relievers have already picked up at least one save each .
