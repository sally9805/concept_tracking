The TIME Washington correspondents who reported this week 's cover stories did what almost every American near an electrical outlet tried to do last week : they watched Oliver North testify on Capitol Hill . But the correspondents attended the sessions in person and then called sources for reaction . " More legwork is required in reporting major scandals than in any other type of reporting , " says Congressional Correspondent Hays Gorey , who recalls wearing out a few pairs of shoes covering Watergate . " Sources are so few and reporters so many that dozens of calls are never returned . You have to track sources to restaurants , to their homes , even board planes to get interviews . " <P> At the White House , the situation proved even more frustrating for Correspondent Barrett Seaman . " Just about everybody with any connection to Iran-contra matters is no longer working at the White House , " he says . " Revisiting events from even six months ago is a bit like playing Where Are They Now ? " <P> David Beckwith , who reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knew where his subject was but found him reluctant to talk . " Until a few months ago , " says Correspondent Beckwith , " Admiral Poindexter and his wife Linda were readily accessible . As Poindexter began talking to the Senate committee and special counsel investigators , however , his lawyer ordered both of them to stop talking to reporters . " When Beckwith sat next to his former source at a dinner this spring , Poindexter chatted happily about his computer hobbies and his family but said hardly anything about a certain arms deal with a certain country in the Middle East . <P> After months of chasing down elusive documents , Congressional Correspondent Michael Duffy arrived in the Senate Caucus Room last week to find aides distributing 500 pages of material to each reporter . As the week wore on , Duffy filled three loose-leaf binders with more than 1,150 pages of declassified documents , computer messages and memos  --  all toted around by him in an aging gym bag . From his seat only a dozen feet from North , Duffy watched for four days as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a classic confrontation , " he says , " and North seemed to relish it . "
