Executives and economists fear that huge deficits will slow growth <P> Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker calls the U.S. economic recovery , which reached its first birthday this month , " a lusty infant . " Ronald Reagan proudly notes that output is " growing faster than even we expected . " The rebound has rescued some 2 million Americans from unemployment and given millions more a new feeling of confidence . Families are buying more shirts and sofas , carpets and computers , autos and airline tickets now than they were in the bleak autumn of 1982 . Factories are bustling again as companies hurriedly build up inventories to make sure they stay ahead of demand . The Federal Reserve Board reported last week that industrial production hit an all-time peak in October , up 14.8% from the recession 's 1982 low point . <P> As sales have surged , so have profits . A Wall Street Journal survey of 506 major companies found that earnings were up 29% in the July-September quarter , compared with the same period a year ago . Some of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession . Profits jumped 44% in the forest-products business , 58% for rubber companies and 93% for airlines . The auto industry had the most stunning turnaround of all . After losing $187 million in 1982 's third quarter , General Motors , Ford and Chrysler earned $1.2 billion in that period of 1983 . <P> In the past , such rosy figures would have been cause for unbounded optimism . But not this year . Many economists and businessmen remain unusually subdued and concerned . Reason : the recovery is endangered by the federal budget deficit , which threatens to top $200 billion in each of the next few years .

The difference between the prime rate that banks charge corporate customers ( currently 11% ) and the inflation level is now about 6 percentage points , or roughly twice as large as in previous recoveries . <P> As the economy gathers strength , the credit needs of private business could collide with the Government 's heavy borrowing and push interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in growth , or even a new recession , could come in 1985 . Warns Henry Kaufman , widely respected chief economist for Salomon Brothers , the Wall Street investment firm : " The durability of this economic expansion is going to be significantly limited by the huge deficits in the federal budget . " Industry leaders share that anxiety . Says John Smale , president of Procter &; Gamble : " The size of the federal deficit is a national problem of substantial urgency that must be addressed with statesmanship , vigor and speed . " <P> Despite the growing alarm , Congress rushed to adjourn last week without facing up to the budget dilemma . The consequences of such inaction could be severe . Even if the infant recovery survives , it may grow up deformed , with some parts of the economy performing far worse than others . Onerous interest rates could stall comebacks by the housing and auto industries . The high cost of borrowing money could depress capital spending and thus continue to devastate key business sectors such as steel , construction equipment and machine tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep slump .
