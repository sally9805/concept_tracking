txt The claw hammer on the eyecatcluqg poster is poised to pull out the nails pinning the Greek flag to the wall . The head of one nail carries the initials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . another those of the European Economic Communities , and a third nail is labeled " bases , " the American military bases in Greece . " With Pasok in government , " the poster asserts . " Greece will belong to the Greeks and will have a foreign policy independent . proud and respected . " This is one of a score of colorful campaign posters of Pasok , the Panhellenic Socialist Movement . To the dismay of the U.S. . ind other allied powers . Pasok is given a good chance of winning the parliamentary elections here on Oct. 18 and bringing Greece its first avowedly leftist and antiWestern government . Pasok is capitalizing on a widespread disaffection with current economic and social progress . the same " time for a change " sentiment that has been turning out governments of right , left and center all across Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly at campaign rallies , is the one potent word : " Allayi " ( pronounced ah-lah-yee ) . meaning " change . " Toned-Down Rhetoric Pasok 's leader is the chansmatic Andreas Papandreou . the 62-year-old son of George Papandreou , who led a center-left movement in Greece in the 1960s . The Harvard-educated Mr. Papandreou , who taught economics at Harvard . Minnesota and the University of California , has of late toned down some of his anti-American. antiNATO. anti-Common Market rhetoric . He wants to appear more statesmanlike to the middle-of-the-road voters he needs for vic-tory But few Greek or Western observers doubt that a Pasok government would strain . if not break . Greece 's he s with the Western alliance . Pasok also says it would move steadily to " socialize " important sections of Greek business , although it does n't specify what it means by that . " Papandreou certainly gives us heartburn. " a NATO official says . " Even if he wanted to change his views after he was elected . I do n't think his left wing would let him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral in public , but they obviously would be a lot happier if the pro-Western New Democracy Party of Prime Minister George Rallis was kept in power . On the Defensive With the volatility of the Middle East , a friendly and reliable Greece seems more essential than ever to the West . The U.S. Navy and Air Force have strategic bases and installations here , and NATO has vital earlywarning sites . Moreover , a neutralist Greece would leave Turkey . the farthesteast member of NATO . far more isolated and exposed . " You really have to think of them as a team covering our southeastern flank . " the NATO official declares . " If Greece is out of the alliance , Turkey is weakened and we are weakened . " But the 63-year-old Mr. Rallis and his center-right party , which has been in power since the military government of the " colonels " collapsed in early 1974 are clearly on the defensive in the current campaign . Mr. Rallis is an owlish , low-keyed lawyer who held a variety of top government'posts before becoming prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime prime minister . Constantine Karamanlis , moved up to the largely honorary post of president . He has been improving recently as a campaigner but still lacks the dynamism of either Mr. Karamanlis or Mr. Papandreou . So far , he has been running a remarkably restrained campaign , trying to focus on the vagueness and contradictions in the Papandreou program , while also trying to prove that Greece has gotten important economic and military benefits from its ties to the West . ( Greece joined the Common Market Jan. 1 , and it reentered the NATO military structure last year after having quit in 1974 in protest of NATO 's failure to do something about the Turkish invasion of Cyprus . ) Mr. Rallis told a party rally in Pirgos the other day that the opposition Pasok " wants us to withdraw from everywhere  --  from NATO . from EEC , from Europe . They want Greece to become small and unimportant . This will fatally lead Greece to an end that will be similar to that of Lebanon . " " Us or the Madmen " But many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Rallis and his campaigners will have to bear down hard in these closing days of the campaign on the penis of a Papandreou government . " The government is hardening its tone  --  us or the madmen , " economist George Cnmbas observes . Achilles Gerokostopoulos , a member of the incumbent New Democracy 's central committee , concedes . " The majority of our followers will vote in a positive fashion . But many people who are undecided will be influenced by fear and uncertainty . " Both New Democracy and Pasok are competing for the votes of the 12% of the electorate who supported center parties in the last election in 1977. parties that have since disintegrated because of weak leadership and factional infighting . New Democracy . which polled over 54% of the popular vote in the first post-colonels elections in 1974 , saw its share drop to 41.8% in 1977 . Meanwhile , the Pasok share almost doubled . from 13.6% in 1974 to 25.3% in 1977 . Recent polls have put Pasok six to 10 percentage pomts ahead of New Democracy . The Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in third place , apparently improving somewhat on the 9.4% it got in 1977 . But no one places great faith in these opinion polls , and almost everyone agrees that the undecided vote is huge . " Greeks talk radical but become conservative in the voting booth , " a Greek businessman says . New Voting System Some six million Greeks will vote Oct. 18 . Under a new " reenforced proportional representation " system , a popular vote of little more than 40% can conceivably bring a comfortable majority in the 300-member parliament . It is hard to ignore the campaign talk anywhere in Greece . Political advertising is n't permitted on the state-run television or radio , but each party is given a limited amount of free time , and the regular news shows are filled with campaigning . The streets of Athens he under a white blanket of discarded fliers urging the merits of one candidate or another , and only the Acropolis seems to have escaped the campaign posters plastered on every wall and pole . In small towns , party loudspeakers blare from dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally to rally . Everywhere . Pasok pushes for a change " The people are fed up with us because we have been around too long , " ruefully says the industry minister , Stefanos Manos , a businessman with a degree from Harvard Business School . " There are other factors , of course . For example , we 've had a more or less stagnant economy for the past year or two . But everywhere in the world , people are showing they want to try something different , to see if that makes things better . " In the ** Greece had above-average economic growth of 5% to 67 a year in real terms , and everywhere there were new houses and office buildings , new vacation colonies , expensive new cars and TV sets . But in mid-1979 , the Greek economy slowed . reflecting a combination of oll-pnce increases , the world economic slowdown and anti-inflationary austerity moves by the government . Growth dropped to 3.7% in 1979 , 1.9% last year and possibly 1.5% this year . Inflation of 25% Inflation , meanwhile . jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel an economic pinch did have their high expectations jolted . Though unemployment remains negligible and though Mr. Rallis endlessly recites how much per capita income , factory wages and other indicators of wealth jumped between 1974 and 1980 , it 's the old story of " What have you done for me lately ? " " It 's mainly psychological , " argues Anthony Saoulls , the president of Hellenit S.A. , a major producer of asbestos cement products . " The Improvement in the condition of the Greek people has been tremendous . But New Democracy has been here for quite a few years . and people like a change every now and then . " Says a Greek executive in a leading multinational . " Even some smallbusiness men I know are saying . ' Times are n't so good . why not try something else ? ' They figure Pasok would go after the big companies and leave them alone . " The economy is n't the only factor contributing to the desire for change . The incumbent government is blamed for widespread inefficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rural areas , traffic jams and air pollution in an overcrowded Athens . The government also suffers from antiAmerican sentiment that goes back to a general Greek suspicion that if the Central Intelligence Agency did n't actually install the colonels ' junta in 1967 to head off the likely victory of a center-left government headed by George Papandreou , the U.S. certainly helped keep It there . This is fertile soil for a virtuoso campaigner like Mr. Papandreou . a vigorous . strong-faced man with incandescent eyes . Mr. Papandreou left Greece for the U.S. In his early 20s after being arrested for " leftist " activities . After his academic pursuits in the U.S. , he returned to Greece . In 1963. he entered Greek politics , becoming a member of parliament and working in his father 's campaigns and qabinets . When the colonels took over , he left Greece again to rally sentiment against them in the West , and on their collapse in 1974 he returned and launched Pasok . Defense expenditures. he says , must have " absolute priority " in view of continued sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aegean . He still calls for the eventual elimination of U.S. bases in Greece . But recognizing the Greek military 's need for American and allied arms , he now talks of a " transitional period " during which the bases would stay but with a larger Greek voice in their use . Pasok no longer talks of immediate withdrawal from NATO . with Greece becoming nonaligned . Rather , it says that withdrawal is somehow contingent on " the dissolution of both Cold War blocs : NATO and the Warsaw Pact . " Mr. Papandreou can still tell a TV audience that " Greece 's entry into the European community has put the critical decisions on the development of our economy not in Athens but in Brussels . " Yet , where he once called for quitting the EC immediately . he now talks about a popular referendum on the issue , and meanwhile he is trying to negotiate with Brussels to get better terms for Greece .
