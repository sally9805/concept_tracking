Gina , " the minister intoned , " do you agree to love Peter more than you love chocolate ? " The bride said , " I do . " <P> After that touch , Peter 's promise fell a little flat . " Peter , " the minister asked , " do you agree to love Gina more than the morning newspaper ? " The bridegroom looked into his bride 's eyes with a smile of insufferable whimsy : " I do . " <P> It is high marrying season . The Gina-Peter ceremony was performed not long ago by the Rev. Bart Gould of the Second Unitarian Church of Chicago . The Rev. Mr. Gould has a taste for the fun nuptial . At the conclusion of his own marriage ceremony in 1977 , he turned to his bride , before the assembled guests , and said : " Thank you for choosing an outrageous cuss like me . " He was overcome . He broke down and wept . His bride burst out laughing . <P> Despite Gould 's exertions , this June can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ' 70s were the great epoch of the improvisational , personalized wedding ceremony-preferably performed in a sun-shot meadow , the bride barefoot and vaguely pagan , Chlo going to Daphnis . <P> The vows concocted for those weddings seem period pieces now . They were oppressively poetic , gushily confessional . They were sweet and intimate and profound and occasionally metaphysical , like a Hallmark card . They were illuminated by moonbeams of Kahlil Gibran ( " Sing and dance together and be joyous , but let each one of you be alone " ) and drenched with fragrances of Rod McKuen . At one wedding of the time , the bridegroom rhapsodized : " It is therefore our glorious and divine purpose to fly mountains , to sow petalscent. . . to glorify glory , to love with love . " His bride answered : " We hereby commit ourselves to a serenity more flamboyant and more foolish than a petalfall of Magnolia . " And the bridegroom came back thus : " This is the purest double helix of our us-ness . " <P> Only occasionally do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains common enough , of course . It is usually performed with traditional vows , however , for the same reason that a dancing dog generally does the foxtrot ; the bizarre does its best work in conventional forms . There are the hobbyist enthusiasms : the nudist nuptials , for example , and the ceremonies for skindivers performed underwater . In April a couple were married while circling above California 's Santa Monica mountains , scrunched down with the minister in a single-engine Beechcraft Sierra . The rest of the wedding party , including the mother of the bride and the maid of honor , flew alongside in a second Beechcraft four-seater , then-faces grimacing merrily and soundlessly in the little windows . <P> The stunt wedding has a certain goofball exhibitionist charm . The ceremony in which the couple write their own vows is more problematic . It is probably just as well that couples have been returning to the traditional formula , wherein the dearly beloved are gathered and the old familiar take-this-man , take-this-woman deal is struck . Couples only occasionally tinker here and there . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are equivalent ; the word obey is vanishing. )
