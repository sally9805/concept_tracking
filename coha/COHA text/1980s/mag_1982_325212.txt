Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman is the most forthright , and therefore often the loneliest , of America 's friends on the Arabian peninsula . He is also the most optimistic , as TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott found during an interview with the 41-year-old monarch . <P> Qaboos ( pronounced Caboose ) has been the only leader in the region to support openly the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat 's separate peace with Israel and to endorse the Camp David agreements . Like Ronald Reagan , Qaboos feels that the most realistic possibility for a Middle East settlement is some form of Jordanian-Palestinian confederation once Israel has returned most of the West Bank to Jordan . <P> Other Arab leaders charge , and many Western experts are worried , that the Israeli expulsion of the Palestine Liberation Organization from Beirut has been a net setback to American interests and influence in the area , since the U.S. is widely , if simplistically , seen in the Arab world as an accomplice in the Israeli invasion . Qaboos does not agree with this view . He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " People have now discovered that the West , and the U.S. in particular , could actually do something to bring the situation to an end . They 've discovered that the Soviets , with all their might , would not do much except sell arms to them . So the U.S. and the West have come to be seen more clearly as the only force willing and able to influence the outcome of the crisis for the better . <P> " However , " Qaboos cautions , " there has been an increase in expectations about what more the U.S. can do . People now want to see the problem solved once and for all , in every aspect . " <P> Qaboos feels that his own standing in the Arab world may be somewhat strengthened in the aftermath of the Lebanon crisis , if the U.S. can eventually persuade Israel to compromise . He says : " Some of those who used to talk about so-called Arab solidarity were completely against anyone who supported Egypt and who remained friends with the U.S. Now that kind of talk has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libyans . People who hoped that the more radical Arab states would fight Israel and stand behind the Palestinians , discrediting the moderate Arabs , have seen their hopes come to nothing . Now the moderates are in a stronger position than the hardliners . I think many rather envy us for pulling through and for sticking to our position . " <P> Qaboos made clear that he intends to stick to another position that has aroused criticism and controversy : a willingness to cooperate with the U.S. on military measures . But he warns Washington to proceed cautiously . " Permanent American bases in an area as sensitive as this would be counterproductive , " he says , " and exercises should not have the appearance of an invasion .
