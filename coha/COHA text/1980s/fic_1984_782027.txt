 | Cracks of thunder follow ; the skies grow dark and the rains come . A deluge , pounding the angry waters taken by surprise , distorting vision , crashing down on the giant spray , Geneva 's trademark on the lake , the jet d'eau , that geyser designed by man to dazzle man . When sudden revelations come , the gigantic fountain dies . All the fountains die and without the sunlight the flowers wither . The bright reflections are gone and the mind is frozen . Geneva . City of inconstancy . Joel Converse , attorney-at-law , walked out of the hotel Richemond into the blinding morning sunlight on the Jardin Brunswick . Squinting , he turned left , shifting his attache case to his right hand , conscious of the value of its contents but thinking primarily about the man he was to meet for coffee and croissants at Le Chat Botte , a sidewalk cafe across from the waterfront . " Re-meet " was more accurate , thought Converse , if the man had not confused him with someone else . A. Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the finalizing of last-minute details for a Swiss-American merger that had brought both men to Geneva . Although the remaining work was minimal  --  formalities , really , research having established that the agreements were in accord with the laws of both countries and acceptable to the International Court in The Hague  --  Halliday was an odd choice . He had not been part of the American legal team fielded by the Swiss to keep tabs on Joel 's firm . That in itself would not have excluded him  --  fresh observation was frequently an asset  --  but to elevate him to the position of point , or chief spokesman , was , to say the least , unorthodox . It was also unsettling . Halliday 's reputation  --  what little Converse knew of it  --  was as a troubleshooter , a legal mechanic from San Francisco who could spot a loose wire , rip it out and short an engine . Negotiations covering months and costing hundreds of thousands had been aborted by his presence , that much Converse recalled about A. Preston Halliday . But that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's Press Halliday , " the voice had announced over the hotel phone . " I 'm pointing for Rosen in the Comm Tech  --  Bern merger . " " What happened ? " Joel had asked , a muted electric razor in his left liannd , his mind trying to locate the name ; it had come to him by the time I Ialliday replied . " ' I'l-c poor bastard had a stroke , so his partners called me in . " The lawyer had paused . " You must have been mean , counselor . " " We rarely argued , counselor . Christ , I 'm sorry , I like Aaron . How is hc ? "  | " I It 'll make it . They 've got him in bed and on a dozen versions of . *sicken soup . He told me to tell you he 's going to check your finals for 41wisiblc ink . " " Which means you 're going to check because I do n't have any and neither did Aaron . This marriage is based on pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that as well as I do . " " The larceny of investment write-offs , " agreed Halliday , " combined *Oh a large chunk of a technological market . No invisible ink . But since I 'm the new boy on the block , I 've got a couple of questions . Let 's have cakfast . " " I was about to order room service . " " It 's a nice morning , why not get some air ? I 'm at the President , so let 's lit the distance . Do you know the Chat Botte ? " " American coffee and croissants . Quai du Mont Blanc . " " You know it . How about twenty minutes ? " " Make it a half hour , okay ? " " Sure . " Halliday had paused again . " It 'll be good to see you again , I " " Oh ? Again ? " " You may not remember . A lot 's happened since those days .. : more you than to me , I 'm afraid . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was Vietnam and you were a prisoner for a pretty long " ' 1'liat 's not what I meant , and it was years ago . How do we know each What case ? " " No case , no business . We were classmates . " " Duke ? It 's a large law school . " " Further back . Maybe you 'll remember when we see each other . If you ' t , I 'll remind you . " " You must like games .... Half an hour . Chat Botte . " As Converse walked toward the Quai du Mont Blanc , the vibrant yard fronting the lake , he tried to fit Halliday 's name into a time c , the years to a school , a forgotten face to match an unremembered mate . None came , and Halliday was not a common name , the short r " Press " even less so . . . unique , actually . If he had known someone pled Press Halliday , he could not imagine forgetting it . Yet the tone voice had implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you again , Joel . He had spoken the words warmly , Icc had the gratuitous reference to Joel 's POW status . But then , those wards were always spoken softly to imply sympathy if not to express it converse understood why under the circumstances Halliday  | felt he had to bring up the subject of Vietnam , even fleetingly . The uninitiated assumed that all men imprisoned in the North Vietnamese camps for any length of time had been mentally damaged , per se , that a part of their minds had been altered by the experience , their recollections muddled . To a degree , some of these assumptions were undeniable , but not with respect to memory . Memories were sharpened because they were searched compulsively , often mercilessly . The accumulated years , the layers of experience . . . faces with eyes and voices , bodies of all sizes and shapes ; scenes flashing across the inner screen , the sights and sounds , images and smells  --  touching and the desire to touch . . nothing of the past was too inconsequential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , especially at night  --  always at night , with the cold , penetrating dampness stiffening the body and the infinitely colder fear paralyzing the mind  --  memories were everything . They helped mute the sharp reports of small-arms fire , which were gratuitously explained in the mornings as necessary executions of the uncooperative and unrepentant . Or they blocked out the distant screams in the dark , of even more unfortunate prisoners forced to play games , too obscene to describe , demanded by their captors in search of amusement . Like most men kept isolated for the greater part of their imprisonment , Converse had examined and reexamined every stage of his life , trying to understand . . . to like . . . the cohesive whole . There was much that he did not understand  --  or like  --  but he could live with the product of those intensive investigations . Die with it , if he had to ; that was the peace he had to reach for himself . Without it the fear was intolerable . And because these self-examinations went on night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it easier than most men to remember whole segments of his life . Like a spinning disk attached to a computer that suddenly stops , his mind , given only basic information , could isolate a place or a person or a name . Repetition had simplified and accelerated the process , and that was what bewildered him now . Unless Halliday was referring to a time so far back as to have been only a brief , forgotten childhood acquaintance , no one of that name belonged to his past . It 'll he good to see you again , Joel . Were the words a ruse , a lawyer 's t rick ? Converse rounded the corner , the brass railing of Le Chat Botte glistening . luitling back tiny explosions of sunlight . The boulevard was alive with gleaming small cars and spotless buses ; the pavements were washed clean , the , toillers in various stages of hurried but orderly progress . Morning was . r hmc lot benign energy in Geneva . Even the newspapers above the tables  | the sidewalk cafes were snapped with precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles and pedestrians were not at war ; paahat was supplanted by looks and nods , stops and gestures of acknowlpig mciit . As Joel walked through the open brass gate of Le Chat Botte wondered briefly if Geneva could export its mornings to New York . then the City Council would vote the import down , he concluded ? citizens of New York could not stand the civility . A newspaper was snapped directly below him on his left , and when it lowered Converse saw a face he knew . It was a coordinated face , not lice his own , the features compatible and in place . The hair was straight dark , neatly parted and brushed , the nose sharp , above well-defined ' I'lac face belonged to his past , thought Joel , but the name he remem1 ( lid not belong to the face . ae familiar-looking man raised his head ; their eyes met and A. Preston iday rose , his short compact body obviously muscular under the exive suit . " Joel , how are you ? " said the now familiar voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilo ... Avery , " replied Converse , staring , awkwardly shifting his Nlaelac case to grip the hand . " It is Avery , is n't it ? Avery Fowler . Taft , , Mtly sixties . You never came back for the senior year , and no one knew y , we all talked about it . You were a wrestler . " " Twice All New England , " said the attorney , laughing , gesturing at the it across from his own . " Sit down and we 'll catch up . I guess it 's sort surprise for you . That 's why I wanted us to meet before the conferthis morning . I mean , it 'd be a hell of a note for you to get up and In ' Impostor ! ' when I walked in , would n't it ? " " 1 ' 111 still not sure I wo n't . " Converse sat down , attache case at his feet , yiiig his legal opponent . " What 's this Halliday routine ? Why did n't say something on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was I going to say ? ' By the way , old sport , you used know me as Tinkerbell Jones . ' You never would have showed up . " Is Fowler in jail somewhere ? " " Ile would have been if he had n't blown his head off , " answered Iiday , not laughing . You 're full of surprises . Are you a clone ? " No , the son . " Converse paused . " Maybe I should apologize . " " No need to , you could n't have known . It 's why I never came back for senior year . . . and , goddamn it , I wanted that trophy . I would have 1 the only mat jock to win it three years in a row . "  | " I 'm sorry . What happened . . . or is it privileged information , counselor ? I 'll accept that . " " Not for you , counselor . Remember when you and I broke out to New Haven and picked up those pigs at the bus station ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And only got taken , never got laid . " " Our eyebrows were working overtime . " " Preppies , " said Halliday . " They wrote a book about us . Are we really that emasculated ? " " Reduced in stature , but we 'll come back . We 're the last minority , so we 'll end up getting sympathy . . . . What happened , Avery ? " A waiter approached ; the moment was broken . Both men ordered American coffee and croissants , no deviation from the accepted norm . The waiter folded two red napkins into cones and placed one in front of each . " What happened ? " said Halliday quietly , rhetorically , after the waiter left . " The beautiful son of a bitch who was my father embezzled four hundred thousand from the Chase Manhattan while he was a trust officer , and when he was caught , went bang . Who was to know a respected , if transplanted , commuter from Greenwich , Connecticut , had two women in the city , one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was beautiful . " " He was busy . I still do n't understand the Halliday . " " After it happened  --  the suicide was covered up  --  Mother raced back to San Francisco with a vengeance . We were from California , you know ... but then , why would you ? With even more vengeance she married my stepfather , John Halliday , and all traces of Fowler were assiduously removed during the next few months . " " Even to your first name ? " " No , I was always Press ' back in San Francisco . We Californians come up with catchy names . Tab , Troy , Crotch  --  the 1950 's Beverly Hills syndrome . At Taft , my student ID read Avery Preston Fowler , ' so you all just started calling me Avery or that awful Ave . ' Being a transfer student , I never bothered to say anything . When in Connecticut , follow the gospel according to Holden Caulfield . " " That 's all well and good , " said Converse , " but what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to happen . " " You 'd he surprised how rarely . After all , it was a long time ago , and the ixoplc I grew up with in California understood . Kids out there have their names changed according to matrimonial whim , and I was in the Eat for only a couple of years , just long enough for the fourth and fifth  | rs at school . I did n't know anyone in Greenwich to speak of , and I hardly part of the old Taft crowd . " " You had friends there . We were friends . " " I did n't have many . Let 's face it , I was an outsider and you were n't particular . I kept a pretty low profile . " " Not on the mats , you did n't . " I lalliday laughed . " Not very many wrestlers become lawyers , something aixtlt mat burns on the brain . Anyway , to answer your question , only maybe five or six times over the past ten years has anyone said to me , Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was ? ' When Somebody did , I told them the truth . My mother remarried when I was teen . The coffee and croissants arrived . Joel broke his pastry in half . " And thought I 'd ask the question at the wrong time , specifically when I you at the conference . Is that it ? " , " Professional courtesy . I did n't want you dwelling on it  --  or me  --  when piu should be thinking about your client . After all , we tried to lose our Vkginity together that night in New Haven . " " Speak for yourself . " Joel smiled . Halliday grinned . " We got pissed and both admitted it , do n't you nniiber ? Incidentally , we swore each other to secrecy while throwing in the can . " " Just testing you , counselor . I remember . So you left the gray-flannel cI for orange shirts and gold medallions ? " " All the way . Berkeley , then across the street to Stanford . " " Good school .... How come the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the best way of paying for it . That 's it started , really . How about you ? I 'd think you would have had all traveling you ever wanted . " " I had delusions about the foreign service , diplomatic corps , legal - lion . That 's how it started . " " After all that traveling you did ? " e'oniverse leveled his pale blue eyes at Halliday , conscious of the coldant in his look . It was unavoidable , if misplaced  --  as it usually was . " Yes , Oct . III that traveling . There were too many lies and no one told us about ii until it was too late . We were conned and it should n't have hap-i " alliclay leaned forward , his elbows on the table , hands clasped , his gaze riling Joel 's . " I could n't figure it , " he began softly . " When I read your me in the papers , then saw you paraded on television , I felt awful . I lrt't really know you that well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a natural reaction . I 'd have felt the same way if it had been you . " I 'm not sure you would . You see , I was one of the honchos of the protest movement . " " You burned your draft card while flaunting the Yippie label , " said Converse gently , the ice gone from his eyes . " I was n't that brave . " " Neither was I. It was an out-of-state library card . " " I 'm disappointed . " " So was I  --  in myself . But I was visible . " Halliday leaned back in his chair and reached for his coffee . " How did you get so visible , Joel ? I did n't think you were the type . " " I was n't . I was squeezed . " " I thought you said conned . ' " " That came later . " Converse raised his cup and sipped his black coffee , uncomfortable with the direction the conversation had taken . He did not like discussing those years , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had made him out to be someone he was not . " I was a sophomore at Amherst and not much of a student . . . . Not much , hell , I was borderline-negative , and whatever deferment I had was about to go down the tube . But I 'd been flying since I was fourteen . " " I did n't know that , " interrupted Halliday . " My father was n't beautiful and he did n't have the benefit of concubines , but he was an airline pilot , later an executive for Pan Am . It was standard in the Converse household to fly a plane before you got your driver 's license . " " Brothers and sisters ? " " A younger sister . She soloed before I did and she 's never let me forget it . " I remember . She was interviewed on television . " " Only twice , " Joel broke in , smiling . " She was on your turf and did n't give a damn who knew it . The White House bunker put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tarnish the cause , and check her mail while you 're at it . ' " " That 's why I remember her , " said Halliday . " So a lousy student left college and the Navy gained a hot pilot . " " Not very hot , none of us was . There was n't that much to be hot against . Mostly we burned . " " Still , you must have hated people like me back in the States . Not your sister , of course . " " I Icr , tot ) , " corrected Converse . " Hated , loathed , despised  --  furious . But only when someone was killed , or went crazy in the camps . Not for  | you were saying  --  we all knew Saigon  --  but because you said it Mill otit any real fear . You were safe , and you made us feel like assholes . Dumb , frightened assholes . " " I understand that . " " So nice of you . " " I 'm sorry , I did n't mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sound , counselor ? " I1rlliday frowned . " Condescending , I guess . " No guess , " said Joel . " Right on . " You 're still angry . " Not at you , only the dredging . I hate the subject and it keeps coming up . " Line the Pentagon PR . For a while you were a bona fide hero on nightly news . What was it , three escapes ? On the first two you got lit and put on the racks , but on the last one you made it all by yourself , ' t you ? You crawled through a couple of hundred miles of enemy Ir before you reached the lines . " It was barely a hundred and I was goddamned lucky . With the first tries I was responsible for killing eight men . I 'm not very proud of Can we get to the Comm Tech  --  Bern business ?

" reston Halliday has one , his rep confirms it . You 're a shark , if my guts are accurate . But I knew someone named Avery , not Press . " wen it 's Fowler talking , you 're more comfortable with him . " ' hat 's the point ? " A couple of questions first . You see , I want to be accurate because ' vr got a reputation too . They say you 're one of the best on the nat Tonal scene , but the people I 've talked to ca n't understand why ( : o n averse stays with a relatively small if entrenched firm when he 's enough to get flashier . Or even go out on his own . " Arc you hiring ? " Not me , I do n't take partners . Courtesy of John Halliday , attorney-atSan Francisco .

There 's a little matter of lumv. amiable but demanding . "  | " Child support , too ? " " None , thank heavens . " " What happened when you got out of the Navy ? How did you feel ? " Halliday again leaned forward , his elbow on the table , chin cupped in his hand  --  the inquisitive student . Or something else . " Who are the people you 've talked to ? " asked Converse . " Privileged information , for the moment , counselor . Will you accept that ? " Joel smiled . " You are a shark ... . Okay , the gospel according to Converse . I came back from that disruption of my life wanting it all Angry , to be sure , but wanting everything .

Then Duke offered me an accelerated program and I went there , followed by some specializations at Georgetown while I interned . " " You interned in Washington ? " Converse nodded . " Yes . " " For whom ? " " Clifford 's firm . " Halliday whistled softly , sitting back . " That 's golden territory , a passport to Blackstone 's heaven as well as the multinationals . " " I told you I had preferential treatment . " " Was that when you thought about the foreign service ? While you were at Georgetown ? In Washington ? " Again Joel nodded , squinting as a passing flash of sunlight bounced off a grille somewhere on the lakefront boulevard . " Yes , " he replied quietly . " You could have had it , " said Halliday . " They wanted me for the wrong reasons , all the wrong reasons . When they realized I had a different set of rules in mind , I could n't get a twenty-cent tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifford firm ? You were a hell of an image , even for them . " The Californian raised his hands above the table , palms forward . " I know , I know . The wrong reasons . " " Wrong numbers , " insisted Converse . " There were forty-plus lawyers on the masthead and another two hundred on the payroll . I 'd have spent ten years trying to find the men 's room and another ten getting the key That was n't what I was looking for . " " What were you looking for ? " " Pretty much what I 've got . I told you , the money 's good and I run the international division . The latter 's just as important to me. "  | ou could n't have known that when you joined , " objected Halliday . But I did . At least I had a fair indication . When Talbot , Brooks and m as you put it , that small but entrenched firm I 'm with  --  came to wt. reached understanding . If after four or five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c  --  r for Brooks . He was the overseas man and was getting tired of u+tmg to all those time zones . " Again Converse paused . " Apparently pm cc ! out . " " And just as apparently somewhere along the line you got married . " loci leaned back in the chair . " Is this necessary ? " " It ' , not even pertinent , but I 'm intensely interested . " " W I iy ? " Its a natural reaction , " said Halliday , his eyes amused . " I think you 'd the same way if you were me and I were you , and I 'd gone through t you went through . " hark dead ahead , " mumbled Converse . u do n't have to respond , of course , counselor . " I know , but oddly enough I do n't mind . She 's taken her share of abuse use of that what-I've-been-through business . " Joel broke the croissant made no effort to remove it from the plate . " Comfort , convenience , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon ? " Pier words , " continued Joel . " She said that I got married so I 'd have cc to go and someone to fix the meals and do the laundry , and mate the irritating , time-consuming foolishness that goes with finding inc to sleep with . Also by legitimizing her , I projected the proper r ... And , Christ , did I have to play the part ' ? also her words . " ' ere they true ? " I told you , when I came back I wanted it all and she was part of it . they were true . Cook , maid , laundress , bedmate , and an acceptable , t ive appendage . She told me she could never figure out the pecking he sounds like quite a girl . " She was . She is. " o I discern a note of possible reconciliation ? " No way .

Some of us just cut meant for a hearth and roast turkey , even if we sometimes wish were . It 's not a bad life . " Arc you into it ? " asked Joel quickly so as to shift the emphasis .  | " Right up with orthodontists and SAT scores . Five kids and one wife . I would n't have it any other way . " " But you travel a lot , do n't you ? " " We have great homecomings . " Halliday again leaned forward , as if studying a witness . " So you have no real attachments now , no one to run back to . " " Talbot , Brooks and Simon might find that offensive . Also my father . Since Mother died we have dinner once a week when he 's not flying all over the place , courtesy of a couple of lifetime passes . " " He still gets around a lot ? " " One week lie 's in Copenhagen , the next in Hong Kong . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoiled rotten . " " I think I 'd like him . " Converse shrugged , again smiling . " You might not . He thinks all lawyers are piss ants , me included . He 's the last of the white-scarved flyboys . " " I 'm sure I 'd like him . . . . But outside of your employers and your father , there are no  --  shall we say  --  priority entanglements in your life . " " If you mean women , there are several and we 're good friends , and I think this conversation has gone about as far as it should go . " " I told you , I had a point , " said Halliday . " Then why not get to it , counselor ? Interrogatories are over . " The Californian nodded . " All right , I will . The people I spoke with wanted to know how free you were to travel . " " The answer is that I 'm not . I 've got a job and a responsibility to the company I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger tied up by Friday , I 'll take the weekend off and be back on Monday  --  when I 'm expected . " " Suppose arrangements could be made that Talbot , Brooks and Simon found acceptable ? " " That 's presumptuous . " " And you found very difficult to reject . " " That 's preposterous . " " Try me , " said Halliday . " Five hundred thousand for accepting on a best-efforts basis , one million if you pull it off . " " Now you 're insane . " A second flash of light blinded Converse , this one remaining stationary longer than the first . He raised his left hand to block it from his eyes as he stared at the man he had once known as Avers Fowler . " Also , ethics notwithstanding because you have n't a damn thing to win this morning , your timing smells . I do n't like getting offers  --  even crazy offers  --  from attorneys I 'm about to meet across a table . " " Two separate entities , and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will or lose .

Where 's the conflict ? " " Where 's the sanity ? " asked Joel . " To say nothing of those arrangeswots Talbot , Brooks and Simon will find acceptable . You 're talking IOu  --  hly about two and a half top years of salary and bonuses for nodding head . " " Nod it , " said Halliday . " We need you . " " %S'e ' That 's a new wrinkle , is n't it ?

" " General George Marcus Delavane , " Halliday broke in . He delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bolt of lightning had streaked down through the blinding sunlight burning Joel 's eyes , turning the ice into fire . Cracks of thunder followed , exploding in his head . The pilots sat around the long rectangular table in the wardroom , sipping coffee and staring down into the brown liquid or up at the gray walls , no one caring to break the silence . An hour ago they had been sweeping over Pak Song , firing the earth , interdicting the advancing North Vietnamese battalions , giving vital time to the regrouping AR VN and American troops who soon would be under brutal siege . They had completed the strike and returned to the carrier  --  all but one . They had lost their commanding officer . Lieutenant Senior Grade Gordon Ramsey had been hit by a fluke rocket that had winged out of its trajectory over the coastline and zeroed in on Ramsey 's fuselage ; the explosion had filled the jet streams , death at six hundred miles an hour in the air , life erased in the blinking of an eye . A severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be no more strikes , perhaps for several days . There would be time to think and that was not a pleasant thought . " Lieutenant Converse , " said a sailor by the open wardroom door . " Yes ? " " The captain requests your presence in his quarters , sir . " The invitation was so nicely phrased , mused Joel , as he got out of his chair , acknowledging the somber looks of those around the table . The request was expected , but unwelcome . The promotion was an honor he would willingly forgo . It was not that he held longevity or seniority or even age over his fellow pilots ; it was simply that he had been in the air longer than anyone else and with that time came the experience necessary for the leader of a squadron . As he climbed the narrow steps up toward the bridge he saw the outlines of an immense army Cobra helicopter in the distant sky stuttering its way toward the carrier . In five minutes or so it would be hovering over the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paying the Navy a visit . " It 's a terrible loss , Converse , " said the captain , standing over his chart .

" " Easy , Lieutenant . You 're dismissed . " " I respectfully request to answer the general , sir ! " shouted Joel , in his anger refusing to move . " You what , prissy flyboy ? " " My name is ? " " Forget it , I 'm not interested ! " Delavane whipped his head back toward the captain . " What I want to know is why you think you can disobey my orders  --  the orders from Command-Saigon !

" " Goddamn you , I 've got four thousand troops  --  maybe twenty percent seasoned  --  moving up into Sector Five ! We need a low-altitude combined strike from land and sea and well have it if I have to get your ass out of here within the hour ! And I can do it , Captain ! ... We 're over here to win , win , and win it all ! We do n't need sugarcoated Nellies hedging their goddamned bets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war is a risk ! You do n't win if you do n't risk , Captain ! " " I 've been there , General . Common sense cuts losses , and if you cut enough losses you can win the next battle . " " I 'm going to win this one , with or without you , Blue Boy ! " " I respectfully advise you to temper your language , General . " " You what ? " Delavane 's face was contorted in fury , his eyes the eyes of a savage wild animal . " You advise me ? You advise Command-Saigon ! Well , you do whatever you like  --  Blue Boy in your satin pants  --  but the incursion up into the Tho Valley is on . " " The Tho , " interrupted Converse . " That 's the first leg of the Pak Song route . We 've hit it four times . I know the terrain . " " You know it ? " shouted Delavane.  | " I do , but I take my orders from the commander of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take orders from the President of the United Pates ! He 's your commander in chief ! And I 'll get those orders !

" I , too , would advise e General to be careful of his language . " " Why , shit-kicker ? Has Blue Boy got this place wired ? " " Easy , Lieutenant ! I said you were dismissed ! " " You want me to watch my language , big fella with your little silver bar ? u , sonny boy , you watch it , and you read it ! If that squadron of yours is n't the air at fifteen hundred hours , I 'll label this carrier the biggest yellow ak in Southeast Asia ! You got that , satin-pantsed Blue Boy , third Once more Joel replied , wondering as he spoke where he found the ducity . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I sincerely hope we Kt under different circumstances sometime . I think you 're a pig . " " Insubordination ! Also , I 'd break your back . " " Dismissed , Lieutenant ! " " No , Captain , you 're wrong ! " shouted the general . " He may be the man lead this strike , after all . Well , what 'll it be , Blue Boys ? Airborne , or President of the United States  --  or the label ? " 1520 hours Converse led the squadron off the carrier deck . At 1538 , as n ' headed at low altitude into the weather , the first two casualties ocned over the coastline ; the wing planes were shot down  --  fiery deaths at hundred miles an hour in the air . At 1S46 Joel 's right engine exploded ; t altitude made the direct hit easy . At 1546.30 , unable to stabilize , inverse ejected into the downpour of the storm clouds , his parachute ftantly swept into the vortex of the conflicting winds . As he swung lently down toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ipping buffet , one image kept repeating its presence within the darkness . v maniacal face of General George Marcus Delavane . He was about to din an indeterminate stay in hell , courtesy of a madman . And as he later imed , the losses were infinitely greater on the ground . rl.lvarrc ! The Butcher of Danang and Pleiku . Waster of thousands , lowing battalion after battalion into the jungles and the hills with Nlhcr adequate training nor sufficient firepower . Wounded , frightened adieu had been marched into the camps , bewildered , trying not to qtr and , finally understanding , weeping out of control . The stories they  | told were a thousand variations on the same sickening theme . Inexperienced , untried troops had been sent into battle within days after disembarkation ; the weight of sheer numbers was expected to vanquish the often unseen enemy . And when the numbers did not work , more numbers were sent . For three years command headquarters listened to a maniac . Delavane ! The warlord of Saigon , fabricator of body counts , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extoller of death without a cause ! A man who had proved , finally , to be too lethal even for the Pentagon zealots  --  a zealot who had outdistanced his own , in the end revolting his own . He had been recalled and retired ? only to write diatribes read by fanatics who fed their own personal furies . Men like that ca n't be allowed anymore , do n't you understand ? He was the enemy , OUR enemy ! Those had been Converse 's own words , shouted in a fever of outrage before a panel of uniformed questioners who had looked at each other , avoiding him , not wanting to respond to those words . They had thanked him perfunctorily , told him that the nation owed him and thousands like him a great debt , and with regard to his final comments he should try to understand that there were often many sides to an issue , and that the complex execution of command frequently was not what it appeared to be . In any event , the President had called upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fueling old controversies ? And then the final kicker , the threat . " You yourself briefly assumed the terrible responsibility of leadership , Lieutenant , " said a pale-faced Navy lawyer , barely glancing at Joel , his eyes scanning the pages of a file folder . " Before you made your final and successful escape  --  by yourself , from a pit in the ground away from the main camp  --  you led two previous attempts involving a total of seventeen prisoners of war . Fortunately you survived , but eight men did not . I 'm sure that you , as their leader , their tactician , never anticipated a casualty risk of nearly fifty percent . It 's been said often , but perhaps not often enough command is awesome , Lieutenant . " Translation : Do n't join the freaks , soldier . You survived , but eight were killed . Were there circumstances the military is not aware of , tactics that protected some more than others , one more than others ? One man who managed to break out  --  by himself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , Converse had been as close to consciously throwing away his life as he would ever have thought possible . Physically assaulting that panel of sanctimonious hypocrites had not been out of the question , apatii he studied the face of each man , his peripheral gaze taking in rows 01 tunic ribbons , battle stars on most . Then a strange thing had happened : disgust , revulsion  --  and compassion  --  swept over him . These were paSided men , a number having committed their lives to their country 's acticc of war . . . only to have been conned , as he had been conned. to protect what was decent meant protecting the worst , who was to say were wrong ? Where were the saints ? Or the sinners ? Could there any of either when all were victims ? isgust , however , won out . Lieutenant Joel Converse , USNR , could bring himself to give a final salute to that council of his superiors . In ? , he had turned , with no military bearing whatsoever , and walked of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . pl- of light again from the boulevard , a blinding echo of the sun from Quaff du Mont Blanc .

He was in Geneva , the man sitting across the table knew everything he was thinking and Ing Why me ? " whispered Joel . Because , as they say , " said Halliday , " you could be motivated . ' s the simple answer . A story was told . The captain of your aircraft der refused to put his planes in the air for the strike that Delavane rtided . Several storms had moved in ; he called it suicidal . But Delaforced him to , threatened to call the macho White House and the captain stripped of his command . You led that strike . It 's ke you got it . " ' n1 alive , " said Converse flatly . " Twelve hundred kids never saw the 1 day and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were in the captain 's quarters when Mad Marcus Delavane his threats and called the shots .

" eaad it before , " corrected the lawyer from California . " Like you  --  and we 're the best in the business under fifty  --  I do n't put a hell of 1 of stock in the written word .

" " Yes , that part 's true , " said Halliday . " Only the Swiss did n't come to me , I went to them . I 've been watching you , waiting for the moment . It had to be the right one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean ? " " Because I 'm being watched . . . . Rosen did have a stroke . I heard about it , contacted Bern , and made a plausible case for myself . " " Your reputation was enough . " " It helped , but I needed more . I said we knew each other , that we went way back  --  which God knows was true  --  and as much as I respected you , I implied that you were extremely astute with finals , and that I was familiar with your methods . I also put my price high enough . " " An irresistible combination for the Swiss , " said Converse . " I 'm glad you approve . " " But I do n't , " contradicted Joel . " I do n't approve of you at all , least of all your methods . You have n't told me anything , just made cryptic remarks about an unidentified group of people you say are dangerous , and brought up the name of a man you knew would provoke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , still pushing that safe Yippee label . " " Calling someone a freak ' is subjectively prejudicial in the extreme , counselor , and would be stricken from the record . " " Still , the point 's been made with the jury , lawyer-man , " said Converse quietly but with anger . " And I 'm making it now . " " Do n't prejudge the safety , " continued Halliday in a voice that was equally quiet . " I 'm not safe , and outside of a proclivity for cowardice , there 's a wife and five children back in San Francisco I care deeply about . " " So you come to me because I have no such  --  what was it ? ? priority entanglements ? " " I came to you because you 're invisible , you 're not involved , and be cause you 're the best , and I ca n't do it ! I legally ca n't do it , and it 's got to be done legally . " " Why do n't you say what you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I 'm getting up and we 'll see each other later across a table . " " I represented Delavane , " said Halliday quickly . " God help me I didn'I know what I was doing , and very few people approved , but I made a point we used to make all the time . Unpopular causes and people also deserve representation . " " I ca n't argue with that . " " I 'm do n't know the cause I do . I found out . "  | I lalliday leaned forward . " The generals , " he said , his voice barely audible . " They 're coming back . " Joel looked closely at the Californian . " From where ? I did n't know they 'd been away . " " From the past , " said Halliday . " From years ago . " Converse sat back in the chair , now amused . " Good Lord , I thought your kind were extinct . Are you talking about the Pentagon menace , Press it is Press , ' is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 11. iight-Ashbury , or the Beverly Hills something or other ? You 're a little behind the times ; you already stormed the Presidio . " " Please , do n't make jokes . I 'm not joking . " Of course not . It 's Seven Days in May , or is it Five Days in August ? Its August now , so let 's call it The Old-Time Guns of August . Nice ring , I think . " " Stop it ! There 's nothing remotely funny , and if there were , I 'd find h before you did . " " That 's a comment , I suppose , " said Joel . " You 're goddamned right it is , because I did n't go through what you r'rtrt through . I stayed out of it , I was n't conned , and that means I can hughr at fanatics because they never hurt me , and I still think it 's the best Ammunition against them . But not now .

But I suppose you 've got a lit Washington will drape the constitutional robes around itself until become threadbare and fall away  --  revealing a uniform , inciden-hy " hod stared at the face in front of him . " You 're not joking , are you ? And pr'tc too bright to try to snow me . " " Or con you , " added Halliday . " Not after that label I wore while INN liitrg you in pajamas halfway across the world . I could n't do it . " I think I believe you . . . . You mentioned several countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely ; a few have bad blood and memories . On purpose ? "  | " Yes , " nodded the Californian . " It does n't make any difference because the group I 'm talking about thinks it has a cause that will ultimately unite them all . And run them all  --  their way . " " The generals ? " " And admirals , and brigadiers , and field marshals  --  old soldiers who pitched their tents in the right camp . So far right there 's been no label since the Reichstag . " " Come on , Avery ! " Converse shook his head in exasperation . " A bunch of tired old warhorses ? " " Recruiting and indoctrinating young , hard , capable new commanders , " interrupted Halliday . " ? coughing their last bellows . " Joel stopped . " Have you proof of that ? " he asked , each word spoken slowly . " Not enough . . . but with some digging . . . maybe enough . " " Goddamn it , stop being elliptical . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Department and the Pentagon , " said Halliday . " Men who clear export licenses and who spend millions upon millions because they 're allowed to spend it , all of which , naturally , widens any circle of friends . " " And influence , " stated Converse . " What about London , Paris , and Bonn  --  Johannesburg and Tel Aviv ? " " Again names . " " How firm ? " " They were there , I saw them myself . It was an accident . How many have taken an oath I do n't know , but they were there , and their stripes fit the philosophical pattern . " " The Reichstag ? " " More encompassing . A global Third Reich . All they need is a Hitler . " " Where does Delavane fit in ? " " He may anoint one . He may designate the Fiihrer . " " That 's ridiculous . Who 'd take him seriously ? " " He was taken seriously before . You saw the results . " " That was then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Men who thought he was right before , and do n't fool yourself , they 're out there by the thousands . What 's mind-blowing is that there are a few dozen with enough seed money to finance his and their delusions  --  which , of course , they do n't see as delusions at all , only as the proper evolution of current history , all other ideologies having failed miserably . " Joel started to speak , then stopped , his thoughts suddenly altered . " WIry have n't you gone to someone who can stop them ? Stop him . "  | " I should n't have to tell you that . Any number of people in the governIsm It  --  elected and appointed  --  and more than a dozen departments . For Starters , there 's Justice . " " I 'd be laughed out of Washington , " said Halliday . " Beyond the fact that we have no proof  --  as I told you , just names , suppositions  --  do n't Itgrt that Yippie label I once wore . They 'd pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But you represented Delavane . " " Which only compounds the problem by introducing the legal aspects . should n't have to tell you that . " " The lawyer-client relationship . " Converse nodded . " You 're in a ss before you can make a charge . Unless you 've got hard evidence lust your client , proof that he 's going to commit further crimes and you 're aiding the commission of those crimes by keeping silent . " " Which proof I do n't have , " interrupted the Californian . ' I'hcn no one will touch you , " added Joel . " Especially ambitious lawat Justice ; they do n't want their postgovernment avenues cut off . As say , the Delavanes of this world have their constituencies . " ' xactly , " agreed Halliday . " And when I began asking questions and to reach Delavane , he would n't see me or talk to me . Instead , I got to telling me I was fired , that if he had known what I was he never I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ng glen answered their country 's call . ' " Converse whistled softly . " And you think you were n't conned ? You ' dc legal services for him , a structure he can use for all intents and ) scs within the law , and if anything smells , you 're the last person who blow the whistle . He drapes the old soldier 's flag around himself and you a vindictive freak . " iilliclay nodded . " There was a lot more in that letter  --  nothing that damage me except where he was concerned , but it was brutal . " 1 ' 1i1 certain of it .

"  | " But it 's where you first got your information , is n't it ? Your leads ? " " That was the accident , and it wo n't happen again . It 's so legitimate it 's legal Clorox . " " Still it 's a front , " insisted Joel . " It has to be if everything  --  or anything ? you 've said is true . " " It 's true , and it is . But nothing 's written down . It 's an instrument for travel , an excuse for Delavane and the men around him to go from one place to another , carrying on legitimate business . But while they 're in a given area , they do their real thing . " " The gathering of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We think it 's a spreading missionary operation . Very quiet and very intense .

" " Not in working for someone I do n't know  --  or approve of . No , I 'm not . " Do you approve of the objectives as I 've outlined them to you ? " " If what you 've told me is true , and I ca n't think of any reason why you 'd lie about it , of course I do . You knew I would . That still does n't answer my question . " " Suppose , " went on Halliday rapidly , " I were to give you a letter stating that the sum of five hundred thousand dollars to be allocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mykonos was provided by a client of mine whose character and reputation are of the highest order . That his ? " " Wait a minute , Press , " Converse broke in harshly . " Please do n't interrupt me , Please ! " Halliday 's eyes were riveted on Joel , a manic intensity in his stare . " There 's no other way , not now . I 'll put my name  --  my professional life on the line . You 've been hired to do confidential work within your specialization by a man known to me to be an outstanding citizen who insists on anonymity . I endorse both the man and the work he 's asked you to do , and swear not only to the legality of tlrc objectives but to the extraordinary benefits that would be derived by any success you might have .

At the worst , they might change the comm. of hnlory to the point where there would n't be any history . "  | Converse sat rigid in his chair , his gaze unbroken . " That 's quite a speech . Practice it long ? " " No , you son of a bitch ! It was n't necessary to practice . Any more than you rehearsed that little explosion of yours twelve years ago in San Diego . ' Mein like that ca n't be allowed anymore , do n't you understand ? He was the enemy , our enemy ? ' . . . Those were the words , were n't they ? " " You did your homework , counselor , " said Joel , his anger controlled . " Why does your client insist on being anonymous ? Why does n't he take his money , make a political contribution , and talk to the director of the CIA , or the National Security Council , or the White House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars is n't chopped chicken liver even today . " " Because he ca n't be involved officially in any way whatsoever . " Halliy frowned as he expelled his breath . " I know it sounds crazy , but that 's way it is . He is an outstanding man and I went to him because I was ered . Frankly , I thought he 'd pick up the phone and do what you just . Call the White House , if it came to it , but he wanted to go this ate . " With me ? " " Sorry , he did n't know you . He said a strange thing to me . He told me find someone to shoot down the bastards without giving them the Itiity of the government 's concern , even its recognition . At first I uldit't understand , but then I did . It fit in with my own theory that IRhiiig at the Delavanes of this world renders them impotent more Dtcuighly than any other way .

" " Next question , " said Joel , a sharp edge to his voice . " Just what the slid you say to Talbot , Brooks that they found so acceptable ? " " Resigned to finding it acceptable , " corrected Halliday . " I had help . you know Judge Lucas Anstett ? " " Second Circuit Court , " said Converse , nodding . " He should have n tapped for the Supreme Court years ago . " ' " That seems to be the consensus . He 's also a friend of my client , and I understand it , he met with John Talbot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing my client 's name , told them rte was a problem that might well erupt into a national crisis if immedi-  | ate legal action was n't taken . Several U.S. firms were involved , he explained , but the problem basically lay in Europe and required the talents of an experienced international lawyer . If their junior partner , Joel Converse , was selected and he accepted , would they consent to a leave of absence so he could pursue the matter on a confidential basis ? Naturally , the judge strongly endorsed the project . " " And naturally Talbot and Simon went along , " said Joel . " You do n't refuse Anstett . He 's too damned reasonable , to say nothing of the power of his court . " " I do n't think he 'd use that lever . " " It 's there . " Halliday reached into his jacket pocket and took out a long white business envelope . " Here 's the letter . It spells out everything I said . There 's also a separate page defining the schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how you want the money paid or where you want it transferred  --  you 'll be given the name of a man who lives on the island ; he 's retired . Phone him ; he 'll tell you when and where to meet . He has all the tools we can give you . The names , the connections as we think they are , and the activities they 're most likely engaged in that violate the laws of their respective governments  --  sending arms , equipment , and technological information where it should n't be sent . Build just two or three cases that are tied to Delavane  --  even circumstantially  --  and it 'll be enough . We 'll turn it all into ridicule . It will be enough . " " Where the hell do you get your nerve ? " said Converse angrily . " I have n't agreed to anything ! You do n't make decisions for me , and neither does Talbot or Simon , nor the holy Judge Anstett , nor your goddamned client ! What did you think you were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements about me behind my back ! Who do you people think you are ? " " Concerned people who think we 've found the right man for the right job at the right time , " said Halliday , dropping the envelope in front of Joel . " Only there 's not that much time left . You 've been where they want to take us and you know what it 's like . " Suddenly the Californian got up " Think about it . We 'll talk later . By the way , the Swiss know we were meeting this morning . If anyone asks what we talked about , tell them I agreed to the final disposition of the Class A stock . It 's in our favor even *  | Hie telephone console was built into the far end of a long , dark conference table . Its muted hum was in keeping with the dignified surroundings . The Swiss arbitre , the legal representative of the canton of Geneva , picked it up and spoke softly , nodding his head twice , then Icplaced the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven of the eight attorneys were in their chairs talking quietly with one another . The eighth , Joel Converse , stood in front of an enormous window Banked by drapes and overlooking the Quai Gustave Ador . The giant jet d ' eau erupted beyond , its pulsating spray cascading to the left under the force of a north wind . The sky was growing dark ; a summer storm was On its way from the Alps . " Messieurs , " said the arbitre . Conversations trailed off as faces were trued to the Swiss . " That was Monsieur Halliday . He has been detained , It urges you to proceed . His associate , Monsieur Rogeteau , has his ' ommendations , and it is understood that he met with Monsieur Conme earlier this morning to resolve one of the last details . Is that not so , onsieur Converse ? " I leads turned again , now in the opposite direction toward the figure by c window . There was no response . Converse continued to stare down the lake . " Monsieur Converse ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frown creasing his brow , his ghts far away , nowhere near Geneva . It is so , monsieur ? " ? Vhat was the question ? " " You met earlier with Monsieur Halliday ? " Converse paused . " It is so , " he replied . " And ? " " And  --  he agreed to the final disposition of the Class A stock . " There was an audible expression of relief on the part of the Americans I a silent acceptance from the Bern contingent , their eyes noncommitNeither reaction was lost on Joel , and under different circumstances might have tabled the item for additional consideration . Halliday 's tltent of Bern 's advantage notwithstanding , the acceptance was too ' ly achieved ; he would have postponed it anyway , at least for an hour 's h of analysis . Somehow it did not matter . Goddamn him ! thought averse . ' " 1'lien let us proceed as Monsieur Halliday suggested , " said the arbitre , acing at his watch .  | An hour stretched into two , then three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed back and forth , points clarified , paragraphs initialed . And still Halliday did not appear . Lamps were turned on as darkness filled the midday sky outside the huge windows ; there was talk of the approaching storm . Then , suddenly , screams came from beyond the thick oak door of the conference room , swelling in volume until images of horror filled the minds of all who heard the prolonged terrible sounds . Some around the enormous table lunged under it , others got out of their chairs and stood in shock , and a few rushed to the door , among them Converse . The arbitre twisted the knob and yanked it back with such force that the door crashed into the wall . What they saw was a sight none of them would ever forget . Joel lashed out , gripping , pulling , pushing away those in front of him as he raced into the anteroom . He saw Avery Fowler , his white shirt covered with blood , his chest a mass of tiny , bleeding holes . As the wounded man fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . The expulsions of breath were too well known to Joel ; he had held the heads of children in the camps as they had wept in anger and the ultimate fear . He held Avery Fowler 's head now , lowering him to the floor . " My God , what happened ? " cried Converse , cradling the dying man in his arms . " They 're . . . back , " coughed the classmate from long ago . " The elevator . They trapped me in the elevator ! . . . They said it was for Aquitaine , that was the name they used . . . Aquitaine . Oh , Christ ! Meg . . . the kids ! " Avery Fowler 's head twisted spastically into his right shoulder , then the final expulsion of air came from his bloodied throat . Converse stood in the rain , his clothes drenched , staring at the unseen place on the water where only an hour ago the fountain had shot up to the sky proclaiming this was Geneva . The lake was angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails . There were no reflections anywhere . But there was distant thunder from the north . From the Alps . And Joel 's mind was frozen . 2 walked past the long marble counter of the hotel Richemond 's front k and headed for the winding staircase on the left . It was habit ; his c was on the second floor and the brass-grilled elevators with their K-colored velvet interiors were things of beauty , but not of swiftness . , he enjoyed passing the casement displays of outrageously priced , liatltly lit jewels that lined the walls of the elegant staircase  --  shimmer  - -  diamonds , blood-red rubies , webbed necklaces of spun gold . Somehow y reminded him of change , of extraordinary change . For him . For a lie had thought would end violently , thousands of miles away in a rim different yet always the same rat-infested cells , with muted gunfire the screams of children in the dark distance . Diamonds , rubies , and n old were symbols of the unattainable and unrealistic , but they were c , and he passed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to acknowledge him , large shining eyes of infinite h staring back , telling him they were there , he was there .

A man he had known as a boy under one name died in his arms years later under another , and the words he had red at the brutal moment of death were as incomprehensible as were paralyzing . Aquitaine . They said it was for Aquitaine . . . . Where  | was sanity , where was reason ? What did the words mean and why had he been drawn into that elusive meaning ?

" " Mon Dieu , are you all right , Joel ? Your office in New York has been calling you repeatedly . I heard it on the radio , it is all over Geneva ! La drogue ! Drugs , crime , guns . . . murder ! It touches even us now ! " " Is that what they say ? " " They say small packages of cocaine were found under his shirt , a respected avocat international a suspected connection ?

A trust had been given , and been accepted in death . " Christ , you 're drenched ! " cried Henri , intense concern in his eyes " You 've been walking in the rain , have n't you ? There were no taxis ? " " I did n't look , I wanted to walk . " " Of course , the shock , I understand . I 'll send up some brandy , some decent Armagnac .

" " No , you would n't . Who 'd write his letters ? " The secretary paused briefly , her voice calmer when she spoke . " Oh , God , Joel , you 're the end . After what you 've been through , you still find something funny to say . " " It 's easier , Jane . Let me have Bubba , will you ? " " You are the limit ! " Lawrence Talbot , senior partner of Talbot , Brooks and Simon , was a perfectly competent attorney , but his rise in law was as much due to his having been one of the few all-American football players from Yale as from any prowess in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more of a coordinating coach than the driving force of a conservative yet highly competitive law firm . He was also eminently fair and fair-minded ; he kept his word . He was one of the reasons Joel had joined the firm ; another was Nathan Simon , a giant both of a man and of air attorney . Converse had learned more about the law from Nate Simon than from any other lawyer or professor he had ever met . He felt closest to Nathan , yet Simon was the most difficult to get close to ; one ap proached this uniquely private man with equal parts of fondness and reserve . Lawrence Talbot burst over the phone . " Good Lord , I 'm appalled ' What can I say ? What can I do ? " " To begin with , strike that horseshit about Halliday . He was no more a drug connection than Nate Simon . " " You have n't heard , then ? They 've backed off on that .

" Nothing whatsoever , Larry , " he said . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whitewashed island of the Cyclades , neighboring worshiper of Delos . Since Barbarossa 's conquest it had been host to successive brigands of the sea who sailed on the Melteini winds ? Turks , Russians , Cypriots , finally Greeks  --  placed and displaced over the centuries , a small landmass alternately honored and forgotten until the arrival of sleek yachts and shining aircraft , symbols of a different age . Low-slung automobiles  --  Porsches , Maseratis , Jaguars  --  now sped over the narrow roads past starch-white windmills and alabaster churches ; a new type of inhabitant had joined the laconic , tradition-bound residents who made their livings from the sea and the shops . Free-spirited youths of all ages , with their open shirts and tight pants , their sunburned skins serving as foil for adornments of heavy gold , had found a new playground . And ancient Mykonos , once a major port to the proud Phoenicians , had become the Saint-Tropez of the Aegean . Converse had taken the first Swissair flight out of Geneva to Athens , and from there a smaller Olympic plane to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time zones , it was barely four o'clock in the afternoon when the airport taxi crawled through the streets of the hot , blindingwhite harbor and pulled up in front of the smooth white entrance of the bank . It was on the waterfront , and the crowds of flowered shirts and wild print dresses , and the sight of launches chopping over the gentle waves toward the slips on the main pier , were proof that the giant cruise ships far out in the harbor were managed by knowledgeable men . Mykonos was a dazzling snare for tourists ; money would be left on the whitewashed island ; the tavernas and the shops would be full from early sunrise to burning twilight . The ouzo would flow and Greek fishermen 's caps would disappear from the shelves and appear on the swaying heads of suburbanites from Grosse Point and Short Hills . And when night came and the last efharisto and paracalo had been awkwardly uttered by the visitors , other games would begin  --  the courtiers and courtesans , the beautiful , ageless , self-indulgent children of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter would be heard as drachmas were counted and spent in amounts that would stagger even those who had opulent suites on the *  | hours , but knowing the name of the banker he was to contact . Kostas I , Iskaris greeted him cautiously over the phone , making it clear that he expected not only a passport that would clear a spectrograph but the original letter from A. Preston Halliday with his signature , said signature to be subjected to a scanner , matching the signature the bank had been provided by the deceased Mr. A. Preston Halliday . " We hear he was killed in Geneva . It is most unfortunate , " Laskaris had said . " I 'll tell his wife and children how your grief overwhelms me . " Converse paid the taxi and climbed the short white steps of the entrance , carrying his suitcase and attache case , grateful that the door was opened by a uniformed guard whose appearance brought to mind a longf ) rgotten photograph of a mad sultan who whipped his harem 's women in a courtyard when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all what Joel had expected from the brief , disconcerting conversation over the phone . He was a balding , pleasantfaced man in his late fifties , with warm dark eyes , and relatively fluent in English but certainly not comfortable with the language . His first words upon rising from his desk and indicating a chair in front of it for Converse nitradicted Joel 's previous impression . " I apologize for what might have appeared as a callous statement on y part regarding Mr. Halliday . However , it was most unfortunate , and do n't know how else to phrase it . And it is difficult , sir , to grieve for a an one never knew . " " I was out of line . Forget it , please . " " You are most kind , but I am afraid I can not forget the arrangements . ? mandated by Mr. Halliday and his associate here on Mykonos . I must have your passport and the letter , if you please ? " " Who is he ? " asked Joel , reaching into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter . " The associate , I mean . " You are an attorney , sir , and surely you are aware that the information poll desire can not be given to you until the barriers  --  have been leaped , is it were . At least , I think that 's right . " " It 'll do . I just thought I 'd try . " He took out his passport and the letter , handing them to the banker . Laskaris picked up his telephone and pressed a button . He spoke in ( : reek and apparently asked for someone . Within seconds the door npviied and a stunning bronzed , dark-haired woman entered and walked gracefully over to the desk . She raised her downcast eyes and glanced at Joel , who knew the banker was watching him closely . A sign from Conrse , another glance  --  from him directed at Laskaris  --  and introductions  | would be forthcoming , accommodation tacitly promised , and a conceivably significant piece of information would he entered in a banker 's file . Joel offered no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pick up half a million dollars for nodding his head , and then look for a bonus . It did not signify stability ; it signified something else Inconsequential banter about flights , customs and the general deterioration of travel covered the next ten minutes , at which time his passport and the letter were returned  --  not by the striking , clerk Ii ; rired woman but by a young , balletic blond Adonis . The pleasant-faced Iaskaris was not missing a trick ; he was perfectly willing to supply one , whichever route his wealthy visitor required . Converse looked into the Greek 's warm eyes , then smiled , the smile developing into quiet laughter . Laskaris smiled hack and shrugged , dismissing the beachboy . " I am chief manager of this branch , sir , " he . said as the door closed , " but I do not set the policies for the entire hank . This is , after all , Mykonos . " " And a great deal of money passes through here , " added Joel . " Which one did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laskaris , shaking his head . " only on exactly what you did . You 'd be a fool otherwise , and I do not think you are a fool . In addition to being chief manager on the waterfront , I am also an excellent judge of character . " " Is that why you were chosen as the intermediary ? " " No , that is not the reason . I am a friend of Mr. Halliday 's associate here on the island . His name is Beale , incidentally . Dr. Edward Beale . ... You see , everything is in order . " " A doctor ? " asked Converse , leaning forward and accepting his passport and the letter . " He 's a doctor ? " " Not a medical man , however , " clarified Laskaris . " He 's a scholar , a retired professor of history from the United States . He has an adequate pension and he moved here from Rhodes several months ago . A most interesting man , most knowledgeable . I handle his financial affairs  --  in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The banker smiled again , shrugging . " I hope so , " said Joel . " We have a great deal to discuss .

" *  | " I'liose belts are effective , sir , but not if you are unconscious , or if there M no one around to hear them . Might I suggest traveler 's checks ? " You could and you 'd probably be right , but I do n't think so . I may Mrt care to write out a signature . " " As you wish . The denominations for yourself , please ? " said Laskaris , mil in hand , pad below . " And where would you like the remainder to sent .

Frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in let c , Rhodes , Athens , Istanbul , and also much of Europe . A description wired , accompanied by words written out in your handwriting  --  another 1111me , or numbers . One man I knew used nursery rhymes . And then they it matched . One must use a sophisticated bank , of course . " " ( ) f course . Name a few . " ' ' Where ? " " Iii London , Paris , Bonn  --  maybe Tel Aviv , " said Joel , trying to remein ber Halliday 's words . " Bonn is not easy ; they are so inflexible . A wrong apostrophe and they prmilnon whomever they consider their authorities .... Tel Aviv is simple ; money is as freewheeling and as serpentine as the Knesset . London and Paris are standard and , of course , their greed is overwhelming . You will ac heavily taxed for the transfers because they know you will not make an issue over covert funds . Very proper , very mercenary , and very much thievery . " " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had experience , sir . Now , as to the disbursements ? " " I want a hundred thousand for myself  --  nothing larger than fivehundred-dollar bills . The rest you can split up and tell me how I can get tt if I need it . " " It is not a difficult assignment , sir . Shall we start writing names , or numbers  --  or nursery rhymes ? " " Numbers , " said Converse . " I 'm a lawyer . Names and nursery rhymes are in dimensions I do n't want to think about right now . " " As you wish , " said the Greek , reaching for a pad . " And here is Dr. Peale 's telephone number . When we have concluded our business , you tmay call him  --  or not , as you wish . It is not my concern . " Dr. Edward Beale , resident of Mykonos , spoke over the telephone in measured words and the slow , thoughtful cadence of a scholar . Nothing was rushed ; everything was deliberate . ' lucre is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequented at night  | ? about seven kilometers from the waterfront . Walk to it . Take the west road along the coast until you see the lights of several buoys riding the waves . Come down to the water 's edge . I 'll find you . " The night clouds sped by , propelled by high-altitude winds , letting the moonlight penetrate rapidly , sporadically , illuminating the desolate stretch of beach that was the meeting ground . Far out on the water , the red lamps of four buoys bobbed up and down . Joel climbed over the rocks and into the soft sand , making his way to the water 's edge ; he could both see and hear the small waves lapping forward and receding . He lit a cigarette , assuming the flame would announce his presence . It did ; in moments a voice came out of the darkness behind him , but the greeting was hardly what he expected from an elderly , retired scholar . " Stay where you are and do n't move " was the first command , spoken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inhale , then raise your arms and hold them straight out in front of you . . . . Good . Now smoke ; I want to see the smoke . " " Christ , I 'm choking ! " shouted Joel , coughing , as the smoke , blown back by the ocean breeze , stung his eyes . Then suddenly he felt the sharp , quick movements of a hand stabbing about his clothes , reaching across his chest and up and down his legs . " What are you doing ? " he cried , spitting the cigarette out of his mouth involuntarily . " You do n't have a weapon , " said the voice . " Of course not ! " " I do . You may lower your arms and turn around now . " Converse spun , still coughing , and rubbed his watery eyes . " You crazy son of a bitch ! " " It 's a dreadful habit , those cigarettes . I 'd give them up if I were you . Outside of the terrible things they do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used against you in other ways . " Joel blinked and stared in front of him . The pontificator was a slender , white-haired old man of medium height , standing very erect in what looked like a white canvas jacket and trousers . His face  --  what could be seen of it in the intermittent moonlight  --  was deeply lined , and there was a partial smile on his lips . There was also a gun in his hand , held in a firm grip , leveled at Converse 's head . " You 're Beale ? " asked Joel . " Dr. Edward Beale ? " " Yes . Are you calmed down now ? " " Considering the shock of your warm welcome , I guess so . " " ( . ( x-d I 'll put this away , then . " The scholar lowered the gun and knelt down on the u ml next to a canvas satchel . He shoved the wcapcm inside . nil stood up again " I 'm fumy , but I had to he certain . "  | " Of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Halliday 's dead . Could a substitute have been sent in your place ? Someone to deal with an old man in Mykonos ? If so , that person would most certainly have had a gun . " " Why ? " ? " Because he would have had no idea that I was an old man . I might have been a commando . " " You know , it 's possible  --  just possible  --  that I could have had a gun . Would you have blown my goddamned head off ? " " A respected attorney coming to the island for the first time , passing through Geneva 's airport security ? Where would you get it ? Whom would you know on Mykonos ? " " Arrangements could have been made , " protested Converse with little conviction . " I 've had you followed since you arrived . You went directly to the bank , then to the Kouneni hotel , where you sat in the garden and had a drink before going to your room . Outside of the taxi driver , my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden , you spoke to no one . As long as you were Joel Converse I was safe . " " For a product of an ivory tower , you sound more like a hit man from I ) ctroit . " " I was n't always in the academic world , but yes , I 've been cautious . I think we must all be very cautious . With a George Marcus Delavane it 's the only sound strategy . " " Sound strategy ? " " Approach , if you like . " Beale reached between the widely separated buttons of his jacket and withdrew a folded sheet of paper . " Here are the names , " he said , handing it to Joel . " There are five key figures in Delavane 's operation over here . One each from France , West Germany , Israel , South Africa , and England . We 've identified four  --  the first four  --  but we cant find the Englishman . " " flow did you get these ? " " Originally from notes found among Delavane 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ' That was the accident he mentioned , then ? He said it was an accident that would n't happen again . " " I do n't know what he told you , of course , but it certainly was an accident . A faulty memory on Delavane 's part , an affliction I can personally assure you touches the aging . The general simply forgot he had a meeting with Halliday , and when Preston arrived , his secretary let him into the office so he could prepare papers for Delavane , who was expected ' in a half hour or so . Preston saw a file folder on the general 's desk ; he knew  | that folder , knew it contained material he could cross-check . Without thinking twice , he sat down and began working . He found the names , and knowing Delavane 's recent itinerary in Europe and Africa , everything suddenly began to fall into place  --  very ominously . For anyone politically aware , those four names are frightening  --  they dredge up frightening memories . " " Did Delavane ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my judgment , he could never be certain . Halliday wrote them down and left before the general returned . But then Geneva tells us something else , does n't it ? " " That Delavane did find out , " said Converse grimly . " Or he was n't going to take any further chances , especially if there was a schedule , and we 're convinced there is one . We 're in the countdown now . " To what ? " " From the pattern of their operations  --  what we 've pieced together ? a prolonged series of massive , orchestrated conflagrations designed to spin governments out of control and destabilize them . " " That 's a tall order . In what way ? " " Guesswork , " said the scholar , frowning . " Probably widespread , coordinated eruptions of violence led by terrorists everywhere  --  terrorists fueled by Delavane and his people . When the chaos becomes intolerable , it would be their excuse to march in with military units and assume the controls , initially with martial law . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feed and arm a presumed enemy , then send out provocateurs ? " " With massive sums of money and material . " " And when they rise up , " continued Converse , " pull out the rug , crush them , and take over . The citizens give thanks and call the heroes saviors , as they start marching to their drums . But how could they do it ? " " That 's the all-consuming question . What are the targets ? Where are they , who are they ? We have no idea . If we had an inkling , we might approach from that end , but we do n't , and we ca n't waste time hunting for unknowns . We must go after what we do know . " " Again , time , " Joel broke in . " Why are you so sure we 're in a count-down ? " " Increased activity everywhere  --  in many cases frantic . Shipments originating in the States are funneled out of warehouses in England , I rcland , France , and Germany to groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Munich , the Mediterranean and the Arab states ' I'hc talk is in terms of final preparations , but no one seems to know  | what exactly for  --  except that all of them must be ready . It 's as though such groups as Baader-Meinhof , the Brigate Rosse , the PLO , and the red ? legions of Paris and Madrid were all in a race with none knowing the " When is that ? " " Our reports vary , but they 're all within the same time span . Within three to five weeks . " " Oh , my God . " Joel suddenly remembered . " Avery  --  Halliday  --  whispered something to me just before he died . Words that were spoken by the men who shot him . Aquitaine . . . They said it was for Aquitaine . ' Those were the words he whispered . What do they mean , Beale ? " The old scholar was silent , his eyes alive in the moonlight . He slowly turned his head and stared out at the water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't tell me anything . " " No , of course not , " said Beale apologetically , turning back to Converse . " It 's simply the magnitude of it all . It 's so incredible . " " I 'm not reading you . " " Aquitaine  --  Aquitania , as Julius Caesar called it  --  was the name given to a region in southwestern France that at one time in the first centuries after Christ was said to have extended from the Atlantic , across the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean , and as far north as the mouth of the Loire west of Paris on the coast ? " " I 'm vaguely aware of that , " Joel broke in , too impatient for an academic dissertation . " If you are , you 're to be commended . Most people are only aware of the later centuries  --  say , from the eighth on , when Charlemagne conquered the region , formed the kingdom of Aquitaine and bestowed it on his son Louis , and his sons Pepin One and Two . Actually , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " To what ? " The legend of Aquitaine , Mr. Converse . Like many ambitious generals , Delavane sees himself as a student of history  --  in the tradition of Caesar , Napoleon , Clausewitz ... even Patton . I was rightly or wrongly considered a scholar , but he remains a student , and that 's as it should be . Scholars ca n't take liberties without substantive evidence  --  or they should n't  --  but students can and usually do . " " What 's your point ? " " The legend of Aquitaine becomes convoluted , the what-if syndrome riding over the facts until theoretical assumptions are made that distort ? ii the evidence . You see , the story of Aquitaine is filled with sudden , massive expansions and abrupt contractions . To simplify , an imaginative student course , only the moment when it begins . "  | of history might say that had there not been political , marital and military miscalculations on the part of Charlemagne and his son , the two Pepins , and later Louis the Seventh of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were married to the extraordinary Eleanor , the kingdom of Aquitaine might have encompassed most if not all of Europe . " Beale paused . " Do you begin to understand ? " he asked . " Yes , " said Joel . " Christ , yes . " " That 's not all , " continued the scholar . " Since Aquitaine was once considered a legitimate possession of England , it might in time have enveloped all of her foreign colonies , including the original thirteen across the Atlantic  --  later the United States of America . . . . Of course , miscalculations or not , it could never have happened because of a fundamental law of Western civilization , valid since the deposition of Romulus Augustulus and the collapse of the Roman empire . You can not crush , then unite by force and rule disparate peoples and their cultures  --  not for any length of time . " " Someone 's trying to now , " said Converse . " George Marcus Delavane . " " Yes . In his mind he 's constructed the Aquitaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's profoundly terrifying . " " Why ? You just said it could n't happen . " " Not according to the old rules , not in any period since the fall of Rome . But you must remember , there 's never been a time in recorded history like this one . Never such weapons , such anxiety . Delavane and his people know that , and they will play upon those weapons , those anxieties . They are playing upon them . " The old man pointed to the sheet of paper in Joel 's hand . " You have matches . Strike one and look at the names . " Converse unfolded the sheet , reached into his pocket and took out his lighter . He snapped it , and as the flame illuminated the paper he studied the names . " Jesus ! " he said , frowning . " They fit in with Delavane . It 's a gathering of warlords , if they 're the men I think they are . " Joel extinguished the flame . " They are , " replied Beale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remarkable man , quite extraordinary . A Resistance fighter in the war , given the rank of major before he was twenty , but later an unreconstructed member of Salan 's OAS . He was behind an assassins tion attempt on De Gaulle in August of ' 62 , seeing himself as the true leader of the republic . Ile nearly made it . He believed then as he believes now that the Algerian generals were the salvation of an enfeebled France le has . survived not only because he 's a legend , but because his voice is n't Alone only , he 's more persuasive than most . Especially with the elite  | crowd of promising commanders produced by Saint-Cyr . Quite simply , he 's a fascist , a fanatic hiding behind a screen of eminent respectability . " " And the one named Abrahms , " said Converse . " He 's the Israeli strong man who struts around in a safari jacket and boots , is n't he ? The screecher who holds rallies in front of the Knesset and in the stadiums , telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the children of Abraham are denied . Even the Israelis ca n't shut him up . " " Many are afraid to ; he 's become electrifying , like lightning , a symbol . Chaim Abrahms and his followers make the Begin regime seem like reticent , self-effacing pacifists . He 's a sabra tolerated by the European Jews because he 's a brilliant soldier , proven in two wars , and has enjoyed the respect  --  if not the affection  --  of every Minister of Defense since the early years of Golda Meir . They never know when they might need him in the field . " " And this one , " said Joel , again using his lighter . " Van Headmer . South African , is n't he ? The hangman in uniform ' or something like that . " " Jan van Headmer , the slayer of Soweto , ' as the blacks call him . He executes offenders ' with alarming frequency and government tolerance . I Iis family is old-line Afrikaner , all generals going back to the Boer War , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century . Incidentally , he 's a close friend of Abrahms and makes frequent trips to Tel Aviv . He 's also one of the most erudite and charming general diicers ever to attend a diplomatic conference . His presence denies his miage and reputation . " " And Leifhelm , " said Converse , coming to the last of the foreign names . " A mixed bag , if I 'm accurate . Supposedly a great soldier who followed too many orders , but still respected . I 'm weakest on him . " " Entirely understandable , " said Beale , nodding . " In some ways his is the oddest story  --  the most monstrous , really , because the truth has been I consistently covered up so as to use him and avoid embarrassment . Field Marshal Erich Leifhelm was the youngest general ever commissioned by Adolf Hitler . He foresaw Germany 's collapse and made a sudden aboutface . From brutal killer and a fanatic super-Aryan to a contrite professional who abhorred the Nazis ' crimes as they were revealed ' to him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw a Nuremberg courtroom . During the cold war the Allies used his services extensively , panting him full security clearances , and later in the fifties when the new Cennan divisions were mounted for the NATO forces , they made sure was put in command . " " Were n't there a couple of newspaper stories about him a few years had several run-ins with Helmut Schmidt , did n't he ? "  | " Exactly , " agreed the scholar . " But those stories were soft and carried only half the story . Leifhelm was quoted as saying merely that the German people could not be expected to carry the burden of past guilt into future generations . It had to stop . Pride should once more be established in the nation 's heritage . There was some saber rattling aimed at the Soviets , but nothing substantively beyond that . " " What was the other half ? " asked Converse . " He wanted the Bundestag 's restrictions on the armed forces lifted completely , and fought for the expansion of the intelligence services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublemakers . He also sought extensive deletions in German textbooks throughout the school systems . Pride has to be restored , ' he kept saying , and everything he said was in the name of virulent anti-Communism . " " The Third Reich 's first strategy in everything when Hitler took over . " " You 're quite right . Schmidt saw through him and knew there 'd be chaos if he had his way  --  and he was influential . Bonn could not afford the specter of painful memories . Schmidt forced Leifhelm to resign and literally removed his voice from all government affairs . " " But he keeps speaking . " " Not openly . However , he 's rich and retains his friends and contacts . " " Among them Delavane and his people . " " Foremost among them now . " Joel once more snapped his lighter and scanned the lower part of the page . There were two lists of names , the row on the left under the heading State Department , the right under Pentagon . There were perhaps twentyfive people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released the lever ; the flame died and he put the lighter back in his pocket . " The names do n't mean anything to me . " " Some should , but it does n't matter , " said Beale elliptically . " The point is that among those men are disciples of George Delavane . They carry out his orders . How many of them is difficult to say , but at least several from each grouping . You see , these are the men who make the decisions  --  or conversely , do not oppose decisions  --  without which Delavane and his followers would be stopped in their tracks . " " Spell that out . " " Those on the left are key figures in the State Department 's Office of Munitions Control . They determine what gets cleared for export , who under the blanket of national interest ' can receive weapons and technology withheld from others . On the right are the senior officers at the Pcntagou on whose word millions upon millions are spent for armament pros urcments . All are decision makers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few openly , others quietly by diplomatic and military colleagues . We 've learned that much ? " " Questioned ? Why ? " interrupted Converse . " There were rumors  --  there always are rumors  --  of large shipments improperly licensed for export . Then there 's surplus military equipment ? excess supplies  --  lost in transfers from temporary warehouses and outof-the-way storage depots . Surplus equipment is easily unaccounted for ; it 's an embarrassment in these days of enormous budgets and cost overruns . Get rid of it and do n't be too particular . How fortunate in these instances  --  and coincidental  --  if a member of this Aquitaine shows up , willing to buy and with all his papers in order . Whole depots and warehouses are sent where they should n't be sent . " " A Libya connection ? " " There 's no doubt of it . A great many connections . " " Halliday mentioned it and you said it a few moments ago . Laws broken ? arms , equipment , technological information sent to people who should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disruption , terrorism ? " " Justifying military responses , " old Beale broke in . " That 's part of l ) elavane 's concept . Justifiable escalation of armed might , the commanders in charge , the civilians helpless , forced to listen to them , obey them . " " But you just said questions were raised . " " And answered with such worn-out phrases as national security ' and ' adversarial disinformation ' to stop or throw off the curious . " " That 's obstruction . Ca n't they be caught at it ? " " By whom ? With what ? " " Damn it , the questions themselves ! " replied Converse . " Those improper export licenses , the military transfers that got lost , merchandise that ca n't be traced . " " By people without the clearances to go around security classifications , or lacking the expertise to understand the complexities of export licensing . " " That 's nonsense , " insisted Joel . " You said some of those questions were asked by diplomatic personnel , military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise . " " And who suddenly , magically , did n't ask them any longer . Of course , many may have been persuaded that the questions were , indeed , beyond their legitimate purviews ; others may have been too frightened to penetrate for fear of involvement ; others still , forced to back off  --  frankly threatened . Regardless , behind it all there are those who do the convincing , and they 're growing in numbers everywhere . " " Christ , it 's a  --  a network , " said Converse softly .  | The scholar looked hard at Joel , the night light on the water reflecting across the old man 's pale , lined face . " Yes , Mr. Converse , a network . ' That word was whispered to me by a man who thought I was one of them . The network , ' he said . The network will take care of you . ' He meant Delavane and his people . " " Why did they think you were a part of them ? " The old man paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back at Converse . " Because that man thought it was logical . Thirty years ago I took off a uniform , trading it for the Harris tweeds and unkempt hair of a university professor . Few of my colleagues could understand , for , you see , I was one of the elite , perhaps a later , American version of Erich Leifhelm  --  a brigadier general at thirty-eight , and the Joint Chiefs were conceivably my next assignment . But where the collapse of Berlin and the Gotterdammerung in the bunker had one effect on Leifhelm , the evacuation of Korea and the disembowelment of Panmunjom had another effect on me . I saw only the waste , not the cause I once saw ? only the futility where once there 'd been sound reasons . I saw death , Mr. Converse , not heroic death against animalistic hordes , or on a Spanish afternoon with the crowds shouting ' Ole , ' but just plain death . Ugly death , shattering death . And I knew I could no longer be a part of those strategies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified in belief , I might have become a priest . " " But your colleagues who could n't understand , " said Joel , mesmerized by Beale 's words , words that brought back so much of his own past . " They thought it was something else ? " " Of course they did . I 'd been praised in evaluation reports by the holy MacArthur himself . I even had a label : the Red Fox of Inchon  --  my hair was red then . My commands were marked by decisive moves and countermoves , all reasonably well thought out and swiftly executed . And then one day , south of Chunchon , I was given an order to take three adjacent hills that comprised dead high ground  --  vantage points that served no strategic purpose  --  and I radioed back that it was useless real estate , that whatever casualties we sustained were not worth it . I asked for clarification , a field officer 's way of saying You 're crazy , why should I ? ' The reply came in something less than fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all . Because it 's there . ' A symbolic point was to be made for someone 's benefit or someone else 's macho news briefing in Seoul . . . . I took the hills , and I also wasted the lives of over three hundred men  --  and for i  --  y efforts I was awarded another cluster of the Distinguished Service Cross . " Is that when you quit ? "  | " Oh , Lord no , I was too confused , but inside , my head was boiling . The end came , and I watched Panmunjom , and was finally sent home , all manner of extraordinary expectations to be considered my just rewards . ... However , a minor advancement was denied me for a very good reason : I did n't speak the language in a sensitive European post . By then my head had exploded ; I used the rebuke and I took my cue . I resigned quietly and went my way . " It was Joel 's turn to pause and study the old man in the night light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said finally . " Why have n't I ever heard of you ? " " You did n't recognize the names on the two lower lists , either , did you ? Who are the Americans ? ' you said . The names do n't mean anything to me . ' Those were your words , Mr. Converse . " " They were n't young decorated generals  --  heroes  --  in a war . " " Oh , but several were , " interrupted Beale swiftly , " in several wars . They had their fleeting moments in the sun , and then they were forgotten , the moments only remembered by them , relived by them . Constantly . " " That sounds like an apology for them . " " Of course it is ! You think I have no feelings for them ? For men like Chaim Abrahms , Bertholdier , even Leifhelm ? We call upon these men when the barricades are down , we extol them for acts beyond our abilities .... " You were capable . You performed those acts . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the barricades are rebuilt , we consign them to oblivion . Worse , we force them to watch inept civilians strip the gears of reason and , through oblique vocabularies , plant the explosives that will blow those barricades apart again . Then when they 're down once more , we summon our commanders . " " Jesus , whose side are you on ? " 13eale closed his eyes tightly , reminding Joel of the way he used to shut his own when certain memories came back to him . " Yours , you idiot , " said the scholar quietly . " Because I know what they can do when we ask them to do it . I meant what I said before . There 's never been a time in history like this one . Far better that inept , frightened civilians , still talking , still searching , than one of us  --  forgive me , one of them ? " A gust of wind blew off the sea ; the sand spiraled about their feet . " That man , " said Converse , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . Why did he say it ? " " I le thought they could use me . He was one of the field commanders I knew in Korea , a kindred spirit then . He came to my island  --  for what  | reason I do n't know , perhaps a vacation , perhaps to find me , who knows ? and found me on the waterfront . I was taking my boat out of the Plati Harbor when suddenly he appeared , tall , erect and very military in the morning sun . ' We have to talk , ' he said , with that same insistence we always used in the field . I asked him aboard and we slowly made our way out of the bay . Several miles out of the Plati he presented his case , their case . Delavane 's case . " " What happened then ? " The scholar paused for precisely two seconds , then answered simply , " I killed him . With a scaling knife . Then I dropped his body over a cluster of sharks beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the old man  --  the iridescent light of the moon heightened the force of the macabre revelation . " Just like that ? " he said in a monotone . " It 's what I was trained to do , Mr. Converse . I was the Red Fox of Inchon . I never hesitated when the ground could be gained , or an adversarial advantage eliminated . " " You killed him ? " " It was a necessary decision , not a wanton taking of life . He was a recruiter and my response was in my eyes , in my silent outrage . He saw it , and I understood . He could not permit me to live with what he 'd told me . One of us had to die , and I simply reacted more swiftly than he did . " " That 's pretty cold reasoning . " " You 're a lawyer , you deal every day with options . Where was the alternative ? " Joel shook his head , not in reply but in astonishment . " How did Halliday find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never met , never talked , but we have a mutual friend . " " In San Francisco ? " " He 's frequently there . " " Who is he ? " " It 's a subject we wo n't discuss . I 'm sorry . " " Why not ? Why the secrecy ? " *  | " Do n't dwell on it . Accept it . " " Would you ? " " Under the circumstances , yes , I would . You see , there 's no alternative . " Sure there is . I could walk away five hundred thousand dollars richer , ' mid by an anonymous stranger who could only come after me by revealing himself . " " You could but you wo n't . You were chosen very carefully . " " Because I could be motivated ? That 's what Halliday said . " " Frankly , yes . " " You 're off the wall , all of you ! " " One of us is dead . You were the last person he spoke with . " Joel felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying man 's eyes burned into his memory . " Aquitaine , " he said softly . " Delavane .... All right , I was chosen carefully . Where do I begin ? " " Where do you think you should begin ? You 're the attorney ; everything must be done legally . " " That 's just it . I 'm an attorney , not the police , not a detective . " " No police in any of the countries where those four men live could do hat you can do , even if they agreed to try , which , frankly , I doubt . More the point , they would alert the Delavane network . " " All right , I 'll try , " said Converse , folding the sheet with the list of mes and putting it in his inside jacket pocket . " I 'll start at the top . In aris . With this Bertholdier . " " Jacques-Louis Bertholdier , " added the old man , reaching down into is canvas bag and taking out a thick manila envelope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's everything we could learn about those four men ; perhaps it can help you . Their addresses , the cars they drive , business associates , cafes and restaurants they frequent , sexual preferences where they constitute vulnerability . . . anything that could give you an edge . Use ft , use everything you can . Just bring us back briefs against men who have compromised themselves , broken laws  --  above all , evidence that shows they are not the solid , respectable citizens their life-styles would indicate . nibarrassment , Mr. Converse , embarrassment . It leads to ridicule , and eston Halliday was profoundly right about that . Ridicule is the first cp . Joel started to reply , to agree , then stopped , his eyes riveted on Beale . ' N never told you Halliday said anything about ridicule. " " ( ) h ? " The scholar blinked several times in the dim light , momentarily sure of himself , caught by surprise . " But , naturally , we discussed ? " " You never met , you never talked ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend the strategies we might employ , " said the old man , his eyes now steady . " The aspect of ridicule is a keystone . Of course we discussed it . " " You just hesitated . " " You startled me with a meaningless statement . My reactions are not what they once were . " " They were pretty good in a boat beyond the Stephanos , " corrected Joel . " An entirely different situation , Mr. Converse . Only one of us could leave that boat . Both of us will leave this beach tonight . " " All right , I may be reaching . You would be , too , if you were me . " Converse withdrew a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket , shook one up nervously to his lips and took out his lighter . " A man I knew as a kid under one name approaches me years later calling himself something else . " Joel snapped his lighter and held the flame under the cigarette , inhaling . " He tells a wild story that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The believable aspect is a maniac named Delavane . He says I can help stop him  --  stop them  --  and there 's a great deal of money for nodding my head  --  provided by a man in San Francisco who wo n't say who he is , expedited by a former general on a fashionably remote island in the Aegean . And for his efforts , this man I knew under two names is murdered in daylight , shot a dozen times in an elevator , dying in my arms whispering the name Aquitaine . ' And then this other man , this ex-soldier , this doctor , this scholar , tells me another story that ends with a recruiter ' from Delavane killed with a scaling knife , his body thrown overboard into a school of sharks beyond the Stephanos  --  whatever that is . " " The Aghios Stephanos , " said the old man . " A lovely beach , far more popular than this one . " " Goddamn it , I am reaching , Mr. Beale , or Professor Beale , or General Beale ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Suddenly I do n't have much confidence . I feel way beyond my depth  --  let 's face it , overwhelmed and underqualified .... and damned frightened . " " Then do n't overcomplicate things , " said Beale . " I used to say that to students of mine more often than I can remember . I would suggest the not look at the totality that faced them , but rather at each thread ol progression , following each until it met and entwined with another thread , and then another , and if a pattern did not become clear , it w:i not their failure but mine . One step at a time , Mr. Converse . " " You 're one hell of a Mr. Chips . I would have dropped the course " I 'm not saying it well . I used to say it better . When you teach history . threads arc terribly important "  | " When you practice law , they 're everything . " " Go after the threads , then , one at a time . I 'm certainly no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney whose client is under attack by forces that would violate his rights , cripple his manner of living , deny his pursuit of peaceful existence  --  in essence , destroy him ? " " Not likely , " replied Joel . " I 've got a client who wo n't talk to me , wo n't see me , wo n't even tell me who he is . " " That 's not the client I had in mind . " " Who else ? It 's his money . " " He 's only a link to your real client . " " Who 's that ? " " What 's left of the civilized world , perhaps . " Joel studied the old scholar in the shimmering light . " Did you just say something about not looking at totalities but at threads ? You scare the hell out of me . " Beale smiled . " I could accuse you of misplaced concretion , but I wo n't . " " That 's an antiquated phrase . If you mean out-of-context , say it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Professor . " " Good heavens , you were chosen carefully . You wo n't even let an old man get away with an academic bromide . " Converse smiled back . " You 're a likable fellow , General  --  or Doctor . I 'd hate to have met you across a table if you 'd taken up law . " " That could truly be misplaced confidence , " said Edward Beale , his siiiile gone . " You 're only about to begin . " " But now I know what to look for . One thread at a time  --  until the threads meet and entwine , and the pattern 's there for everyone to see . I 'll concentrate on export licenses , and whoever 's shuffling the controls , then connect three or four names with each other and trace them back to ) clavane in Palo Alto . At which point we blow it apart legally . No martyrs , no causes , no military men of destiny crucified by traitors , just plain bloated , ugly profiteers who 've professed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unpatriotic pockets . Why else would they have done it ? Is there another reason ? That 's ridicule , Dr. Beale . Because they ca n't answer . " The old man shook his head , looking bewildered . " The professor becomes a student , " he said hesitantly . " How can you do this ? " " The way I 've done it dozens of times in corporate negotiations . Only , I 'll take it a step further . In those sessions I 'm like any other lawyer . I try to figure out what the fellow across the table is going to ask for and then why lie wants it . Not just what my side wants , but what he wants . What 's  | going through his mind ? You see , Doctor , I 'm trying to think like him ; I 'm putting myself in his place , never for a second letting him forget that I 'm doing just that . It 's very unnerving , like making notes on margins whenever your opponent says anything , whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be different . I 'm not looking for opponents . I 'm looking for allies . In a cause , their cause . I 'll start in Paris , then on to Bonn , or Tel Aviv , then probably Johannesburg . Only , when I reach these men I wo n't try to think like them , I 'm going to be one of them . " " That 's a very bold strategy . I compliment you . " " Talking of options , it 's the only one open . Also , I 've got a lot of money I can spread around , not lavishly but effectively , as befits my unnamed client . Very unnamed , very much in the background , but always there . " Joel stopped , a thought striking him . " You know , Dr. Beale , I take it back . I do n't want to know who my client is  --  the one in San Francisco , I mean . I 'm going to create my own , and knowing him might distort the portrait I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll get a full accounting of my expenses : the rest will be returned to him the same way I got it . Through your friend Laskaris at the bank here on Mykonos . " " But you 've accepted the money , " objected Beale . " There 's no rea-son " I wanted to know if it was real . If he was real . He is , and he knows exactly what he 's doing . I 'll need a great deal of money because I 'm going to have to become someone I 'm not , and money is the most convincing way to do it . No , Doctor , I do n't want your friend 's money , I want Delavane . I want the warlord of Saigon . But I 'll use his money , just as I 'm using him  --  the way I want him to be . To get inside that network . " " If Paris is your first stop and Bertholdier is going to be your initial contact , there 's a specific munitions transfer we think is directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we 're right , it 's a microcosm of what they intend doing everywhere . " " Is it in here ? " asked Converse , tapping the manila envelope contain ing the dossiers . " No , it came to light only this morning  --  early this morning . I do n't imagine you listened to the news broadcasts . " " I do n't speak any language but English . If I heard a news program I would n't know it . What happened ? " " All Northern Ireland is on fire , the worst riots , the most savage killing ; in fifteen years . In Belfast and Ballyclare , Dromore and in the Mourne Mc nuitains , outraged vigilantes-gym both sides  --  arc roaming the streets and the hills , firing indiscriminately , slaughtering in their anger every thing that moves . It 's utter chaos . The Ulster government is in panic ,  | the parliament tied down , emotionally disrupted , everyone trying to find a solution . That solution will be a massive infusion of troops and their commanders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Listen to me carefully , " said the scholar , taking a step forward . " Eight days ago a munitions shipment containing three hundred cases of cluster bombs and two thousand cartons of explosives was air-freighted out of Beloit , Wisconsin . Its destination was Tel Aviv by way of Montreal , Paris , and Marseilles . It never arrived , and an Israeli trace  --  employing the Mossad  --  showed that only the cargo 's paperwork reached Marseilles , nothing else . The shipment disappeared in either Montreal or Paris , and we 're convinced it was diverted to provisional extremists  --  again on both sides  --  in Northern Ireland . " " Why do you think so ? " " The first casualties  --  over three hundred men , women , and children ? were killed or severely wounded , ripped to shreds by cluster bombs . It 's not a pleasant way to die , but perhaps worse to be hurt  --  the bombs tear away whole sections of the body . The reactions have been fierce and the hysteria 's spreading . Ulster 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space of one day , one single day , Mr. Converse ! " " They 're proving to themselves they can do it , " said Joel quietly , the fear in his throat . " Precisely , " agreed Beale . " It 's a test case , a microcosm of the full-scale horror they can bring about . " Converse frowned . " Outside of the fact that Bertholdier lives in Paris , what ties him to the shipment ? " " Once the plane crossed into France , the French insurers were a firm in which Bertholdier is a director . Who would be less suspect than a ccnnpany that had to pay for the loss  --  a company , incidentally , that has access to the merchandise it covers ? The loss was upward of four million francs , not so immense as to create headlines , but entirely sufficient to throw off suspicion . And one more lethal delivery is made  --  mutilation , death , and chaos to follow . " " What 's the name of the insurance company ? " " Compagnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd think . Solidaire , and perhaps Beloit and Belfast . " " Let 's hope I get to confront Bertholdier with them . But if I do , I 've got to say them at the right time . I 'll catch the plane from Athens in the Inorning . ' Take the urgent good wishes of an old man with you , Mr. Converse . And urgent is the appropriate word . Three to five weeks , that 's all you 've  | got before everything blows apart . Whatever it is , wherever it is , it will be Northern Ireland ten thousand times more violent . It 's real and it 's coming . " Valerie Charpentier woke up suddenly , her eyes wide , her face rigid , listening intently for sounds that might break the dark silence around her and the slap of the waves in the distance . Any second she expected to hear the shattering bell of the alarm system that was wired into every window and door of the house . It did not come , yet there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wake her . She pulled the covers back and got out of bed , walking slowly , apprehensively , to the glass doors that opened onto her balcony , which overlooked the rocky beach , the jetty , and the Atlantic Ocean beyond . There it was again . The bobbing , dim lights were unmistakably the same , washing over the boat that was moored exactly where it had been moored before . It was the sloop that for two days had cruised up and down the coastline , always in sight , with no apparent destination other than this particular stretch of the Massachusetts shore . At twilight on the second evening it had dropped anchor no more than a quarter of a mile out in the water in front of her house . It was back . After three days it had returned . Three nights ago she had called the police , who in turn reached the Cape Ann Coast Guard patrols , who came back with an explanation that was no more lucid than it was satisfactory . The sloop was a Maryland registry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were no provocative or suspicious movements that warranted any official action " I 'd call it damned provocative and suspicious , " Val had said firmly " When a strange boat sails up and down the same stretch of beach for two days in a row , then parks in front of my house within shouting distance  --  shouting distance being swimming distance . " " The water rights of the property you leased do n't extend beyond two hundred feet , ma'am " had been the official reply . " There 's nothing we can do . " At the first light of the next morning , however , Valerie knew that something had to be done . She had focused her binoculars on the boat . only to gasp and move back away from the glass doors . Two men had been standing on the deck of the sloop , their own binoculars  --  far more power ful than hers directed at the house , at the bedroom upstairs . At her A rncighlxn ( fowls the bcachside cul-de-sac had recently installed all alarm system She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | husband and three children ; she needed the alarm . Two phone calls and Val was speaking to the owner of Watchguard Security . A temporary system had been hooked up that day while a permanent installation was being designed . A bell  --  not shatteringly loud but soft and gentle . It was the quiet clanging of a ship 's bell out on the dark water , its clapper swinging with the waves . It was the sound that had awakened her , and she felt relieved yet strangely disturbed . Men out on the water at night who intended harm did not announce their presence . On the other hand , those same men had come back to her house , the boat being only several hundred yards offshore . They had returned in the darkness , the moon blocked by a sky thick with clouds , no moonlight to guide them . It was as if they wanted her to know they were there and they were watching . They were waiting . For what ? What was happening to her ? A week ago her phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called the telephone company fmin her friend 's house , a supervisor in the service department told her he could find no malfunctions . The line was operative . " Maybe for you , but not for me , and you 're not paying the bills . " She had returned home ; the line was still dead . A second , far angrier phone call brought the same response . No malfunctions . Then two hours later the dial tone was inexplicably there , the phone working . She had put the episode down to the rural telephone complex having less than the best equipment . She did not know what explanation there could be for the sloop now eerily bobbing in the water in front of her house . Suddenly , in the boat 's dim light , she could see a figure crawl out of the cabin . For a moment or two it was hidden in the shadows , then there was a brief flare of intense light . A match . A cigarette . A man was standing motionless on the deck smoking a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Waiting . Val shivered as she dragged a heavy chair in front of the balcony door but not too close , away from the glass . She pulled the light blanket off the bed and sat down , wrapping it around her , staring out at the water , at the boat , at the man . She knew that if that man or that boat made the slightest move toward shore she would press the buttons she had been Instructed to press in the event of an emergency . When activated , the huge circular alarm bells  --  both inside and outside  --  would be ear-piercrMg , erupting in concert , drowning out the sound of the surf and the waves crashing on the jetty . They could be heard thousands of feet away  --  the ' only sound on the beach , frightening , overwhelming . She wondered if she would cause them to be heard tonight  --  this morning . She would not panic . Joel had taught her not to panic , even when she  | thought a well-timed scream was called for on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable had happened . They had been confronted by drug addicts or punks and Joel would remain calm  --  icily calm  --  moving them both back against a wall and offering a cheap , spare wallet he kept in his hip pocket with a few bills in it . God , he was ice ! Maybe that was why no one had ever actually assaulted them , not knowing what was behind that cold , brooding look . " I should have screamed ! " she once had cried . " No , " he had said . " Then you would have frightened him , panicked him . That 's when those bastards can be lethal . " Was the man on the boat lethal  --  were the men on the boat deadly ? Or were they simply novice sailors hugging the coastline , practicing tacks , anchoring near the shore for their own protection  --  curious , perhaps concerned , that the property owners might object ? An Army officer was not likely to be able to afford a captain for his sloop , and there were marinas only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with men who could handle repairs . Was the man out on the boat smoking a cigarette merely a landlocked young officer getting his sailing legs , comfortable with a familiar anchor away from deep water ? It was possible , of course  --  anything was possible ? and summer nights held a special kind of loneliness that gave rise to strange imaginings . One walked the beach alone and thought too much . Joel would laugh at her and say it was all those demons racing around her artist 's head in search of logic . And he would undoubtedly be right The men out on the boat were probably more up-tight than she was . In a way they were trespassers who had found a haven in sight of hostile natives ; one inquiry of the Coast Guard proved it . And that clearance , as it were , was another reason why they had returned to the place where , if not welcome , at least they were not harassed . If Joel were with her , she knew exactly what he would do . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their temporary neighbors and ask them to come iii for a drink . Dear Joel , foolish Joel , ice-cold Joel . There were times you were comfort ing  --  when you were comfortable . And amusing , so terribly amusing  --  every when you were n't comfortable . In some ways I miss you , darling . But not enough , thank you . And yet why did the feeling  --  the instinct , perhaps  --  persist ? The small boat out on the water was like a magnet , pulling her toward it , drawing her into its field , taking her where she knew she did not want to go . Nonsense ! Demons in search of logic ! She was being foolish  --  foolish loci , ice-cold /oel  --  stop it , for God 's sake ! Be reasonable !  | Then the shiver passed through her again . Novice sailors did not navigate around strange coastlines at night . The magnet held her until her eyes grew heavy and troubled sleep came .

The boat was gone  --  and she wondered for a moment whether it had really been there . Yes , it had . But it was gone .  | The 747 lifted off the runway at Athens ' Helikon Airport , soaring to the left in its rapid ascent . Below in clear view , adjacent to the huge field , was the U.S. Naval Air Station , permitted by treaty although reduced in size and in the number of aircraft during the past several years . Nevertheless , far-reaching , jet-streamed American craft still roamed the Mediterranean , Ionian and Aegean seas , courtesy of a resentful yet nervous government all too aware of other eyes to the north . Staring out the window , Converse recognized the shapes of familiar equipment on the ground . There were two rows of Phantom F-4T 's and A-6E 's on opposite sides of the dual strip  --  updated versions of the F-4G 's and A-6A 's he had flown years ago . It was so easy to slip back , thought Joel , as he watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would head for the top of the runway , and another patrol would be in the skies . Converse could feel his hands tense , in his mind he was manipulating the thick , perforated shaft , reaching for switches , his eyes roaming the dials , looking for right and wrong signals . Then the power would come , the surging force of pressurized toms beside him , behind him , himself encased in the center of a sleek , shining beast straining to break away and soar into its natural habitat Final check , all in order ; cleared for takeoff . Release the power of the beast , let it /rev ! loll ! Faster , faster ; the ground is a blur , the carrier  | deck a mass of passing gray , blue sea beyond , blue sky above . Let it free !

After the Navy , during the academic years in Massachusetts and North Carolina , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to get away from the pressures , to find a few minutes of blue freedom , but there were no challenges , no taming of all-powerful beasts . Later still , it had all stopped ? for a long , long time . There were no airfields to visit on weekends , no playing around with trim company planes ; he had given his promise . His wife had been terrified of his flying . Valerie could not reconcile the hours he had flown  --  civilian and in combat  --  with her own evaluation of the averages . And in one of the few gestures of understanding in his marriage , he had given his word not to climb into a cockpit . It had not bothered him until he knew  --  they knew  --  the marriage had gone sour , at which point he had begun driving out to a field called Teterboro in New Jersey every chance he could find and flown whatever was available , anytime , any hour . Still , even then  --  especially then  --  there had been no challenges , no beasts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 747 stabilized and began the climb to its assigned altitude . Converse turned away from the window and settled back in his seat . The lights were abruptly extinguished on the NO SMOKING sign , and Joel took out a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket . Extracting one , he snapped his lighter , and the smoke diffused instantly iii the rush of air from the vents above . He looked at his watch ; it was 12:20 . They were due at Orly Airport at 3:35 , French time . Allowing for the zones , it was a three-hour flight , and during those three hours he would commit to memory everything he could about General Jacques I.c , uis Bertholdier  --  if Beale and the dead Halliday were right , the arm of Aquitaine in Paris . At Helikon he had done something he had never done before , something that had never occurred to him , an indulgence that was generally attributed to romantic fiction or movie stars or rock idols . Fear and caution had joined with an excess of money , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted no one 's eyes straying to the pages lie would be reading . Old Beale had made it frighteningly clear on the beach last night : if there was the remotest possibility that the materials 6 carried might fall into other hands  --  any other hands  --  he was to destroy them at all costs . For they were in-depth dossiers on men who o ? Ilcl order multiple executions by placing a single phone call . I le reached down for his attache case , the leather handle still dark from  | the sweat of his grip since Mykonos early that morning . For the first time he understood the value of a device he had learned about from films and novels . Had he been able to chain the handle of his attache case to his wrist , he would have breathed far more comfortably . Jacques-Louis Bertholdier , age fifty-nine , only child of Alphonse and Marie-Therese Bertholdier , was born at the military hospital in Dakar . Father a career officer in the French Army , reputedly autocratic and a harsh disciplinarian . Little is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never speaks of her , as if dismissing her existence . He retired from the Army four years ago at the age of fiftyfive , and is now a director of Juneau et Cie. , a conservative firm on the Bourse des Valeurs , Paris 's stock exchange . The early years appear to be typical of the life of a commanding officer 's son , moving from post to post , accorded the privileges of the father 's rank and influence . He was used to servants and fawning military personnel . If there was a difference from other officers ' sons , it was in the boy himself . It is said that he could execute the full-dress manual-of-arms by the time he was five and at ten could recite by rote the entire book of regulations . In 1938 the Bertholdiers were back in Paris , the father a member of the General Staff . This was a chaotic time , as the war with Germany was imminent . The elder Bertholdier was one of the few commanders aware that the Maginot could not hold ; his outspokenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field , commanding the Fourth Army , stationed along the northeastern border . The war came and the father was killed in the fifth week of combat . Young Bertholdier was then sixteen years old and going to school in Paris . The fall of France in June of 1940 could be called the beginning of our subject 's adulthood . Joining the Resistance first as a courier , he fought for four years , rising in the underground 's ranks until he commanded the Calais-Paris sector . He made frequent undercover trips to England to coordinate espionage and sabotage operations with the Free French and British intelligence . In February of 1944 , De Gaulle conferred on him the temporary rank of major . He was twenty years of age . Several days prior to the Allied occupation of Paris , Bertholdier was severely wounded in a street skirmish between the Resistance fighters and the retreating German troops . Hospitalisation relieved him of further activity for the remainder of the European war . Following the surrender he was appointed t o the national military academy at Saint-Cyr , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the under-  | ground . Upon graduation he was elevated to the permanent rank of captain . He was twenty-four and given successive commands in the Dra Hamada , French Morocco ; Algiers ; then across the world to the garrisons at Haiphong , and finally the Allied sectors in Vienna and West Berlin . ( Note this last post with respect to the following information on Field Marshal Erich Leifhelm . It was where they first met and were friends , at first openly , but subsequently they denied the relationship after both had resigned from military service . ) Putting Erich Leifhelm aside for the moment , Converse thought about the young legend that was Jacques-Louis Bertholdier . Though Joel was as urrmilitary as any civilian could be , in an odd way he could identify with the military phenomenon described in these pages . Although no hero , he had been accorded a hero 's return from a war in which very few were so acclaimed , these generally coming from the ranks of those who had endured capture more than they had fought . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges was a dangerous indulgence . Although initially embarrassed , one came to accept it all , and then to expect it all . The recognition could be heady , the privileges soon taken for granted . And when the attention began to dwindle away , a certain anger came into play ; one wanted it all back . These were the feelings of someone with no hunger for authority ? success , yes ; power , no . But what of a man whose whole being was shaped by the fabric of authority and power , whose earliest memories were of privilege and rank , and whose meteoric rise came at an incredibly young sgc ? How does such a man react to recognition and the ever-increasing spectrum of his own ascendancy ? One did not lightly take away much fnrrn such a man ; his anger could turn into fury . Yet Bertholdier had walked away from it all at fifty-five , a reasonably young age for one so prumninent . It was not consistent . Something was missing from the portrait of this latter-day Alexander . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s expanding reputation . After posts in the Dra Hamada and pre-crisis Algiers , ale was transferred to French Indochina , where the situation as deteriorating rapidly for the colonial forces , then enaged in violent guerrilla warfare . His exploits in the field re instantly the talk of Saigon and Paris . The troops under is command provided several rare but much needed victories , ich although incapable of altering the course of the war con ' inced the hard-line militarists that the inferior Asian ces could be defeated by superior Gallic courage and stratr they needed only the materials withheld by Paris . The sur-  | render at Dienbienphu was bitter medicine for those men who claimed that traitors in the Quai d'Orsay had brought about France 's humiliation . Although Colonel Bertholdier emerged from the defeat as one of the few heroic figures , he was wise enough or cautious enough to keep his own counsel , and did not , at least in appearance , join the " hawks . " Many say that he was waiting for a signal that never came . Again he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four years later , however , he broke the mold he had so carefully constructed . In his own words , he was " infuriated and disillusioned " by De Gaulle ' s accords with the independenceseeking Algerians ; he fled to the land of his birth , North Africa , and joined General Raoul Salan ' s rebellious OAS , which violently opposed policies it termed betrayals . During this revolutionary interim of his life he was implicated in an assassination attempt on De Gaulle . With Salan 's capture in April of 1962 , and the insurrectionists ' collapse , once again Bertholdier emerged from de feat stunningly intact . In what can only be described as an extraordinary move  --  and one that has never really been understood  --  De Gaulle had Bertholdier released from prison and brought to the Elysee . What was said between the two men has never been revealed , but Bertholdier was returned to his rank . De Gaulle ' s only comment of record was given during a press conference on May 4 , 1962 . In reply to a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation ) : " A great soldier-patriot must be permitted and forgiven a single misguided interlude . We have conferred . We are satisfied . " He said no more on the subject . For seven years Bertholdier was stationed at various influential posts , rising to the rank of general ; more often than not he was the chief military charge d ' affaires at major embassies during the period of France 's participation in the Military Committee of NATO . He was frequently recalled to the Quaid ' Orsay , accompanying De Gaulle to international conferences , always visible in newspaper photographs , usually within several feet of the great man himself . Oddly enough , although his contributions appear to have been considerable , after these conferences  --  or summits  --  he was invariably sent back to his previous station while internal debates continued and decisions were reached without him . It was as though he was constantly being groomed but never summoned for the critical post . Was that ultimate summons the signal he had been waiting for seven years before at Dienbienphu ? It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe it 's vital to pursue it . With De Gaulle ' ? dramatic resignation after the rejection of his demands for const itutional reform in 1969 , Bertholdier ' s career went into an eclipse . His assignments were far from the  | centers of power and remained so until his resignation . Research into bank and credit-card references as well as passenger manifests shows that during the past eighteen months our subject made trips to the following : London , 3 ; New York , 2 ; San Francisco , 2 ; Bonn , 3 ; Johannesburg , 1 ; Tel Aviv , 1 ( combined with Johannesburg ) . The pattern is clear . It is compatible with the rising geographical pressure points of General Delavane 's operation . Converse rubbed his eyes and rang for a drink . While waiting for the Scotch he scanned the next few paragraphs , his memory of the man now jogged ; the information was familiar history and not terribly relevant . Bertholdier 's name had been put forward by several ultraconservative factions , hoping to pull him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come of the attempts . The ultimate summons had passed him by ; it never came . Currently , as a director of a large firm on the Paris stock exchange , he is basically a figurehead capable of impressing the wealthy and keeping the socialistically inclined at hay by the sheer weight of his own legend . He travels everywhere in a company limousine ( read : staff Joel smiled ; the editor of the report was not without humor . Still , something was missing . His lawyer 's mind looked for the lapse that was not explained . What was the signal Bertholdier had not been given at I ) ienbienphu ? What had the imperious De Gaulle said to the rebellious officer , and what had the rebel said to the great man ? Why was he consistently accommodated  --  but only accommodated  --  never summoned to power ? An Alexander had been primed , forgiven , elevated , then dropped ? There was a message buried in these pages , but Joel could not find it . Converse reached what the writer of the report considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , however , to previous information . car ) , and wherever he goes his arrival is expected , the proper welcome arranged . The vehicle is a dark-blue American Lincoln Continental , License Plate 100-1 . The restaurants he frequents are : Taillevent , the Ritz , Julien , and Lucas-Carton . For lunches , however , he consistently goes to a private club called L'Etalon Blanc three to four times a week . It is a veryoff-the-track establishment whose membership is restricted to the highest-ranking military , what 's left of the rich nobility , and wealthy fawners who , if they ca n't be either , put their money on both so as to be in with the crowd .  | Bertholdier 's private life appears barely pertinent to the activities that concern us . His marriage was one of convenience in the purest La Rochefoucauld sense : it was socially , professionally and financially beneficial for both parties . Moreover , it appears to have been solely a business arrangement . There have been no children , and although Mme. Bertholdier appears frequently at her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely been observed in close conversation . Also , as with his mother , Bertholdier has never been known to discuss his wife . There might be a psychological connection here , but we find no evidence to support it . Especially since Bertholdier is a notorious womanizer , supporting at times as many as three separate mistresses as well as numerous peripheral assignations . Among his peers there is a sobriquet that has never found its way into print : La Grand Machin , and if the reader here needs a translation , we recommend drinks in Montparnasse . On that compelling note the report was finished . It was a dossier that raised more questions than it answered . In broad strokes it described the whats and the bows but few of the whys ; these were buried , and only imaginative speculation could unearth even the probabilities . But there were enough concrete facts to operate on . Joel glanced at his watch ; an hour had passed . He had two more to reread , think , and absorb as much as possible . He had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . Not only was Rene Mattilon an astute lawyer frequently called upon by Talbot , Brooks and Simon when they needed representation in the French courts , but he was also a friend . Although he was older than Joel by a decade , their friendship was rooted in a common experience , common in the sense of global geography , futility and waste . Thirty years ago Mattilon was a young attorney in his twenties conscripted by his government and sent to French Indochina as a legal officer . He witnessed the inevitable and could never understand why it cost so much for his proud , intractable nation to perceive it . Too , he could be scathing in his comnrcnts about the subsequent American involvement . " lllon Dieu ! You thought you could do with arms what we could not do with arms and brains ? Deraisonnable ! " It had become standard that whenever Mattilon flew to New York or Joel to Parrs they found time for dinner and drinks . Also , the Frenchman was . unatmgIy tolerant of Converse 's linguistic limitations ; Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's patient tutoring had fallen  | on deaf and dead ears and an unreceptive brain . For four years his ex-wife , whose father was French and whose mother was German , tried to teach him the simplest phrases but found him hopeless . " How the hell can you call yourself an international lawyer when you ca n't be understood beyond Sandy Hook ? " she had asked . " Hire interpreters trained by Swiss banks and put them on a point system , " he had replied . " They wo n't miss a trick . " Whenever he came to Paris , he stayed in a suite of two rooms at the opulent George V Hotel , an indulgence permitted by Talbot , Brooks and Simon , he had assumed , more to impress clients than to satisfy a balance sheet . The assumption was only half right , as Nathan Simon had made clear . " You have a fancy sitting room , " Nate had told him in his sepulchral voice . " Use it for conferences and you can avoid those ridiculously expensive French lunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose they want to eat ? " " You have another appointment . Wink and say it 's personal ; no one in Paris will argue . " The impressive address could serve him now , mused Converse , as the taxi weaved maniacally through the midafternoon traffic on the ChampsElysees toward the Avenue George V. If he made any progress  --  and he intended to make progress  --  with men around Bertholdier or Bertholdier himself , the expensive hotel would fit the image of an unknown client who had sent his personal attorney on a very confidential search . Of course , he had no reservation , an oversight to be blamed on a substituting secretary . He was greeted warmly by the assistant manager , albeit with surprise and finally apologies . No telexed request for reservations had come from Talbot , Brooks and Simon in New York , but naturally , accommodations would be found for an old friend . They were ; the standard two-room suite on the second floor , and before Joel could unpack , a steward brought a bottle of the Scotch whisky he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry bar . He had forgotten the accuracy of the copious notes such hotels kept on repeating guests . Second floor , the right whisky , and no doubt during the evening he would be reminded that he usually requested a wake-up call for seven o'clock in the morning . It would be the same . But it was close to five o'clock in the afternoon now . If he was going to reach Mattilon before the lawyer left his office for the day , he had to do so quickly . If Rene could have drinks with him , it would be a start .  | Either Mattilon was his man or he was not , and the thought of losing even an hour of any kind of progress was disturbing . He reached for the Paris directory on a shelf beneath the phone on the bedside table ; he looked up the firm 's number and dialed . " Good Christ , Joel ! " exclaimed the Frenchman . " I read about that terrible business in Geneva ! It was in the morning papers and I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said you 'd checked out . Are you all right ? " " I 'm fine . I was just there , that 's all . " " He was American . Did you know him ? " " Only across a table . By the way , that crap about his having something to do with narcotics was just that . Crap . He was cornered , robbed , shot and set up for postmortem confusion . " " And an overzealous official leaped at the obvious , trying to protect his city 's image . I know ; it was made clear . . . . It 's all so horrible . Crime , killing , terrorism ; it spreads everywhere . Less so here in Paris , thank God . " " You do n't need muggers , the taxi drivers more than fill the bill . Except nastier , maybe . " " You are , as always , impossible , my friend ! When can we get to-gether ? " Converse paused . " I was hoping tonight . After you left the office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish you had called before . " " I just got in ten minutes ago . " " But you left Geneva ? " " I had business in Athens , " interrupted Joel . " Ah , yes , the money flees from the Greeks these days . Precipitously , I think . Just as it was here . " " How about drinks , Rene . It 's important . " It was Mattilon 's turn to pause ; it was obvious he had caught the trace of urgency in Converse 's brevity , in his voice . " Of course , " said the Frenchman . " You 're at the George Cinq , I assume ? " " Yes . " " I 'll be there as soon as I can . Say , forty-five minutes . " " ' Thanks very much . I 'll get a couple of chairs in the gallery . " " I 'll find you . " ' I'h:rt area of the immense marble-arched lobby outside the tinted glass ( I ( x rs of thr ( ; c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery " by habitues , its name derived front the fact that there is an art gallery narrowly enclosed within a corridor of clear glass on the left . I lowever , just as reasonably , the name fits the luxurious room itself The deeply cushioned  | cut-velvet chairs , settees , and polished low , dark tables that line the marble walls are beneath works of art  --  mammoth tapestries from longforgotten chateaux and huge heroic canvases by artists , both old and new . And the smooth stone of the floor is covered with giant Oriental rugs , while affixed to the high ceiling are a series of intricate chandeliers , throwing soft light through filigrees of lacelike gold . Quiet conversations take place between men and women of wealth and power at these upholstered enclaves , in calculated shadows under spotlit paintings and woven cloth from centuries ago . Frequently they are opening dialogues , testing questions that as often as not are resolved in boardrooms peopled by chairmen and presidents , treasurers , and prides of lawyers . The movers and the shakers feel comfortable with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this very formal room . The ceremonial environs somehow lend an air of ritualized disbelief ; denials are not hard to come by later . The gallery also lives up to the implications of its name : within the fraternity of those who have achieved success on the international scene , it is said that if any of its members spend a certain length of time there , sooner or later he will run into almost everyone he knows . Therefore , if one does not care to be seen , he should go somewhere else . The room was filling up , and waiters moved away from the raucous bar to take orders at the tables , knowing where the real money was . Converse found two chairs at the far end , where the dim light was even more subdued . He looked at his watch and was barely able to read it . Forty minutes had passed since his call to Rene , a shower taking up the time as it washed away the sweat-stained dirt of his all-day journey from Mykonos . Placing his cigarettes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alert waiter , his eyes on the marble entrance to the room . Twelve minutes later he saw him . Mattilon walked energetically out of the harsh glare of the street lobby into the soft light of the gallery . He stopped for a moment , squinting , then nodded . He started down the center of the carpeted floor , his eyes leveled at Joel from a distance , a broad , genuine smile on his face . Rene Mattilon was in his mid to late fifties , but his stride , like his outlook , was that of a younger man . There was about him that aura peculiar to successful trial lawyers ; his confidence was apparent because it was the essence of his success , yet it was born of diligence , not merely ego and performance . He was the secure actor comfortable in his role , his graying hair and blunt , masculine features all ' part of a calculated effect . Beyond that appearance , however , there was also something else , thought Joel , as he rose from his chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarming conclusion . God knew they  | both had their flaws , but they were both decent men ; perhaps that was why they enjoyed each other 's company . A firm handshake preceded a brief embrace . The Frenchman sat down across from Converse as Joel signaled an attentive waiter . " Order in French , " Joel said . " I 'd end up getting you a hot fudge sundae . " " This man speaks better English than either of us . Campari and ice , please . " " Merci , monsieur . " The waiter left . " Thanks again for coming over , " said Converse . " I mean it . " " I 'm sure you do .... You look well , Joel , tired but well . That shocking business in Geneva must give you nightmares . " " Not really . I told you , I was simply there . " " Still , it might have been you . The newspapers said he died while you held his head . " " I was the first one to reach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it happen before , Rene , " said Converse quietly , no comment in his voice . " Yes , of course . You were better prepared than most , I imagine . " " I do n't think anyone 's ever prepared .... But it 's over . How about you ? How are things ? " Mattilon shook his head , pinching his rugged , weather-beaten features into a sudden look of exasperation . " France is madness , of course , but we survive . For months and months now , there are more plans than are stored in an architect 's library , but the planners keep colliding with each other in government hallways . The courts are full , business thrives . " " I 'm glad to hear it . " The waiter returned with the Campari ; both men nodded to him , and then Mattilon fixed his eyes on Joel . " No , I really am , " Converse continued as the waiter walked away . " You hear so many stories . " " Is that why you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stories of our so-called upheavals ? They 're not so earthshaking , you know , not so different from before . Not yet . Most private industry here was publicly financed through the government . But , naturally , not managed by government incompetents , and for that we pay . Is that what 's bothering you , or more to the point , your clients ? " Converse drank . " No , that 's not why I 'm here . It 's something else . " " You 're troubled , I can see that . Your customary glibness does n't fool Inc I know you too well . So tell me , what 's so important ? That was the word v't UU used on the telephone . " " Yes , I guess it was . It may have been too strong . " Joel drained his glass and rc.0 hcd for his cigarettes  | " Not from your eyes , my friend . I see them and I do n't see them . They 're filled with clouds . " " You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been on planes all day , with some ungodly layovers . " He picked up his lighter , snapping it twice until the flame appeared . " We haggle over foolishness . What is it ? " Converse lit a cigarette , consciously trying to sound casual as be spoke . " Do you know a private club called L'Etalon Blanc ? " " I know it , but I could n't get in the door , " replied the Frenchman , laughing . " I was a young , inconsequential lieutenant  --  worse , attached to the judge advocate  --  essentially with our forces to lend an appearance of legality , but , mind you , only an appearance . Murder was a misdemeanor , and rape to be congratulated . L'Etalon Blanc is a refuge for les Brands rnilitaires  --  and those rich enough or foolish enough to listen to their trumpets . " " I want to meet someone who lunches there three or four times a week . " " You ca n't call him ? " " He does n't know me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to be spontaneous . " " Really ? For Talbot , Brooks and Simon ? That sounds most unusual . " " It is . We may be dealing with someone we do n't want to deal with . " " Ahh , missionary work . Who is he ? " " Will you keep it confidential ? I mean that , not a word to anyone ? " " Do I breathe ? If the name is in conflict with something on our schedule , I will tell you and , frankly , be of no help to you . " " Fair enough . Jacques-Louis Bertholdier . " Mattilon arched his brows in mock astonishment , less in mockery than in astonishment . " The emperor has all his clothes , " said the Frenchman , laughing quietly . " Regardless of who claims otherwise . You start at the top of the line , as they say in New York . No conflict , mon ami ; he 's not un our league  --  as you also say . " " Why not ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be saints , and saints who would be warriors . Who has time for such facades ? " You mean he 's not taken seriously ? " " Oh , no , he is . Very seriously , by those who have the time and the inclination to move abstract mountains . He is a pillar , Joel , grounded in herdic marble and himself immovable . He is the De Gaulle who never followed the original , and some say it is a pity . " " What do you say ? " frowned , then cocked his head in a Gallic shrug . " I 'm not  | sure . God knows the country needed someone , and perhaps Bertholdier could have stepped in and steered a far better course than the one we embarked upon , but the times were not right . The Elysee had become an imperial court , and the people were tired of royal edicts , imperial sermons . Well , we do n't have those any longer ; they 've been supplanted by the dull , gray banalities of the workers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could still do it , I imagine . He began his climb up Olympus when he was very young . " Was n't he part of the OAS ? Salan 's rebels in Algeria ? They were discredited , called a national disgrace . " " That is a judgment even the intellectuals must reluctantly admit could be subject to revision . The way all of North Africa and the Middle East has gone , a French Algeria could be a trump card today . " Mattilon paused and brought his hand to his chin , his frown returning . " Why on earth would Talbot , Brooks and Simon walk away from Bertholdier ? He may be a monarchist at heart , but God knows he 's honor personified . He 's regal , perhaps even pompous , but a very acceptable client for all of that . " " We 've heard things , " said Converse quietly , shrugging now himself , as if to lessen the credibility of hearsay evidence . " Mon Dieu , not his women ? " exclaimed Mattilon , laughing . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not women . " " What then ? " " Let 's say some of his associates , his acquaintances . " " I hope you make the distinction , Joel . A man like Bertholdier can choose his associates certainly , but not his acquaintances . He walks into a room and everyone wants to be his friend  --  most claim he is a friend . " " ' That 's what we want to find out . I want to bring up some names , sec whether they are associates  --  or unremembered acquaintances . " " Bien . Now you 're making sense . I can help ; I will help . We shall have lunch at L'Etalon Blanc tomorrow and the next day . It is the middle of the week and Bertholdier will no doubt choose one or the other to dine there . If not , there 's always the day after . " " I thought you could n't get in the door ? " " Not by myself , no . But I know someone who can , and he will be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I lc wishes to talk with me whenever and wherever he can . He 's a dreadful bore and , unfortunately , speaks very little English  --  numbers rn.rnilV , and words like ' In and out , ' or ' Over and out , ' and ' Dodger-Roger ' or ' Roger Dodger ' and ' runway six ' or ' Lift off five ' and all manner of uu onrprclrcnsihlc phrases . " " A pilot ? "  | " He flew the first Mirages , brilliantly , I might add , and never lets anyone forget it . I shall have to be the interpreter between you , which at least eliminates my having to initiate conversation . Do you know anything about the Mirage ? " " A jet 's a jet , " said Joel . " Pull and sweep out , what else is there ? " " Yes , he 's used that one , too . Pull and sweep something . I thought he was cleaning a kitchen . " " Why does he always want to talk with you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Very much so . We 're representing him in a futile case against an aircraft manufacturer . He had his own private jet , and lost his left foot in one of your crash landings ? " " Not mine , pal . " " The door was jammed . He could n't ground-eject where he wished to , when the plane 's speed was sufficiently reduced for him to avoid a final collision . " " He did n't slap the right buttons . " " He says he did . " " There are at least two backups , including an instant manual , even on your equipment . " " We 've been made aware of that . It 's not the money , you understand ; he 's enormously wealthy . It 's his pride . To lose brings into question his current  --  or if you will , latter-day  --  skills . " " They 'll be a lot more in question under cross-examination . I assume you 've told him that . " " Very gently . It 's what we 're leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference is a hefty fee . " " We 're also saving him from himself . If we did it swiftly or too crudely , he 'd simply dismiss us and be driven to someone far less principled . Who else would take such a case ? The government owns the plant now , and God knows it wo n't pay . " " Good point . What 'll you tell him about me ? About the club ? " Mattilon smiled . " That as a former pilot and an attorney you can bring an expertise to his suit that might be helpful . As to L'Etalon Blanc , I shall suggest it , tell him you 'd be impressed . I shall describe you as something ( ) f an Attila the Hun of the skies . How does that appeal to you ? " " With very little impact . " " Can you carry it off ? " asked the Frenchman . The question was sincere . " I t would be one way to meet Bertholdier . My client and he are not simply : acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off . "  | " Your having been a prisoner of war will be most helpful . If you see Bertholdier enter , and express a desire to meet him , such requests are not lightly refused former POW 's . " " I would n't press that too hard , " said Converse . " Why not ? " " A little digging could turn up a rock that does n't belong in the soil . " " Oh ? " Mattilon 's brows arched again , neither in mockery nor in astonishment , simply surprise . " Digging , ' as you use it , implies something more than a spontaneous meeting with odd names spontaneously thrown about . " " Does it ? " Joel revolved his glass , annoyed with himself , knowing that any argument would only enlarge the lapse . " Sorry , it was an instinctive reaction . You know how I feel about that topic . " " Yes , I do , and I forgot . How careless of me . I apologize . " " Actually , I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? " " You 're the missionary , not I. What shall we call you ? " The Frenchman was now looking hard at Converse . " It does n't matter . " Mattilon squinted . " How about the name of your employer , Simon ? If you meet Bertholdier , it might appeal to him . Le due de Saint-Simon was the purest chronicler of the monarchy . . . . Henry Simon . There must be ten thousand lawyers named Henry Simon in the States . " " Simon it is . " " You 've told me everything , my friend ? " asked Rene , his eyes noncommittal . " Everything you care to . " " Yes , I have , " said Joel , his own eyes a blue-white wall . " Let 's have another drink . " " I think not . It 's late and my current wife has malaise if her dinner is cold . She 's an excellent cook , incidentally . " " You 're a lucky man . " " Yes , I am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and spoke casually . " So was Valerie . I shall never forget that fantastic canard a l'orange she fixed for us three or four years ago in New York . Do you ever hear from her ? " " Hear and see , " answered Converse . " I had lunch with her in Boston last month . I gave her the alimony check and she picked up the tab . By the way , her paintings are beginning to sell . " " I never doubted that they would . " " She did . " " t nnccessarily .... I always liked Val . If you see her again , please give ha my affectionate best . "  | will . " Mattilon rose from the upholstered chair , his eyes no longer noncommittal . " Forgive me , I thought so often you were such a  --  matched pair , I believe is the expression . The passions dwindle , of course , but not the de suite , if you know what I mean . " " I think I do , and speaking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misplaced concretion . " " Je ne comprends pas . " " Forget it , it 's antiquated  --  does n't mean anything . I 'll give her your affectionate best . " " Merci . I 'll phone you in the morning . " i I ' Etalon Blanc was a pacifist 's nightmare . The club 's heavy dark wood walls were covered with photographs and prints , interspersed with framed citations and glistening medals  --  red ribbons and gold and silver disks cushioned on black velvet . The prints were a visual record of heroic carnage going back two centuries , while the evolution in warfare was shown in photographs as the horses and caissons and sabers became motorcycles , tanks , planes and guns , but the scenes were not all that different because the theme was constant . Victorious men in uniform were depicted in moments of glory ; whatever suffering there might have been was strangely absent . These men did not lose  --  no missing limbs or shattered faces here ; these were the privileged warriors . Joel felt a profound fear as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were hard and strong and the word capability ' was written across their faces . What had Beale said on Mykonos ? What had been the judgment of the Red Fox of Inchon , a man who knew whereof he spoke ? ... I know what they can do when we ask them to do it . Yet how much inure could they do if they asked it of themselves ? wondered Joel . Without the impediments of vacillating civilian authorities ? " Luboque has just arrived , " said Mattilon quietly , coming up behind Converse . " I heard his voice in the lobby . Remember , you do n't have to overdo it  --  I 'll translate what I think is appropriate , anyway  --  but nod profoundly when he makes one of his angry remarks . Also laugh when he tells jokes ; they 're dreadful , but he likes it . " " I 'll do my best . " " I 'll give you an incentive . Bertholdier has a reservation for lunch . At his usual place , table eleven , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Joel , seeing the Frenchman 's pressed lips expressing minor triumph . " Table twelve . Now . "  | " If I ever need a lawyer , I 'll call you . " " We 're terribly expensive . Come now , as they say in all those wonderful films of yours , You 're on , Monsieur Simon . ' Play the role of Attila but do n't overplay it . " " You know , Rene , for someone who speaks English as well as you do , you gravitate to the tritest phrases . " " The English language and American phrases have very little in common , Joel , trite or otherwise . " " Smart ass . " " Need I say more ? . . . Ahh , Monsieur Luboque , Serge , mon ami ! " Mattilon 's third eye had spotted the entrance of Serge Luboque ; he turned around as the thumping became louder on the floor . Luboque was a short , slender man ; his physique made one think of those jet pilots of the early period when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being a caricature of himself . His short , waxed moustache was affixed to a miniaturized face that was pinched in an expression of vaguely hostile dismissal directed at both no one and everyone . Whatever he had been before , Laboque was now a poseur who knew only how to posture . With all that was brilliant and exciting buried in the past , he had only the memories , the rest was anger . " Et voici 1'expert judiciaire des compagnies aeriennes , " he said , looking at Converse and extending his hand . " Serge is delighted to meet you and is sure you can help us , " explained Mattilon . " I 'll do what I can , " said Converse . " And apologize for my not speaking French . " The lawyer obviously did so , and Luboque shrugged , speaking rapidly , incomprehensibly ; the word anglais repeated several times . " He , too , apologizes for not speaking English , " said Mattilon , glancing at Joel , mischievousness in his look , as he added , " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed against these decorated walls and shot . " " No way , " said Converse , smiling . " Our executioners might dent the medals and blow up the pictures . Everybody knows you 're lousy shots . " " Quest-ce que vous dites ? " " Monsieur Simon tient a vous remercier pour le dejeuner , " said Matti Ion , turning to his client . " Ii en est tres fier car it estime que l'officic-r francais est l'un des meilleurs du monde . " " What did you say ? " " I explained , " said the lawyer , turning again , " that you were honored to be here , as you believe the French military  --  especially the officer corps  --  to he the finest on earth . " Not only lousy shots but rotten pilots , " said Joel , smiling and nodding .  | " Est-il vrai que vous avez participe a nombreuses missions en Asie du Slid ? " asked Luboque , his eyes fixed on Joel . " I beg your pardon ? " " lie wants it confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you flew many missions . " " Quite a few , " answered Joel . " Beaucoup , " said Mattilon . I , uboque again spoke rapidly , even more incomprehensibly , as he snapped his fingers for a steward . " What now ? " " He 'd rather tell you about his exploits  --  in the interests of the case , of course . " " Of course , " said Converse , his smile now fixed . " Lousy shots , rotten pilots and insufferable egos . " " Ah , but our food , our women , our incomparable understanding of life . " " There 's a very explicit word in French  --  one of the few I learned from my ex-wife  --  but I do n't think I should use it . " Joel 's smile was now cemented to his lips . " That 's right , I forgot , " said Mattilon . " She and I would converse in noire belle lanque ; it used to irritate you so  --  Do n't use it . Remember your incentive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ que ? " Luboque spoke as a steward stood by his side . " Notre ami , Monsieur Simon , suit un tours a l'ecole Berlitz et pourra ainsi s ' entretenir directement avec vous . " " Bien ! " " What ? " " I told him you would learn the Berlitz French so you could dine with him whenever you flew into Paris . You 're to ring him up . Nod , smart ass . " Converse nodded . And so it went . Point , noncounterpoint , non sequitur . Serge Luboque lick ! forth during drinks in the warriors ' playroom , Mattilon translating . iiul advising Joel as to the expression to wear on his face as well as suggesting an appropriate reply . Finally Luboque stridently described the crash that had cost him his left foot and the obvious equipment failures for which he should be compensated . Converse looked properly pained and indignant , and offered to write a legal opinion for the court based on his expertise as a pilot of jet aircraft . Mattilon translated ; Luboque beamed and rattled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . " I le 's forever in your debt , " said Rene .  | " Not if I write that opinion , " replied Converse . " He locked himself in the cockpit and threw away the key . " " Write it , " countered Mattilon , smiling . " You 've just paid for my time . We 'll use it as a wedge to open the door of retreat . Also , he 'll never ask you to dinner when you 're in Paris . " " When 's lunch ? I 'm running out of expressions . " They marched in hesitant lockstep into the dining room , matching , uboque 's gait as he thumped along on the hard , ornate parquet floor . The ridiculous three-sided conversation continued as wine was proffered ? a bottle was sent back by Luboque  --  and Converse 's eyes kept straying to the dining room 's entrance . The moment came : Bertholdier arrived . He stood in the open archway , his head turned slightly to his left as another man in a light-brown gabardine topcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subordinate retreated . Then the great man walked into the room quietly but imperially . Heads turned and the man acknowledged the homage as a dauphin who will soon be king accepts the attentions of the ministers of a failing monarch . The effect was extraordinary , for there were no kingdoms , no monarchies , no lands to be divided through conquest to the knights of Crecy or anybody else , but this man of no royal lineage was tacitly being recognized goddamn it , thought Joel  --  as an emperor in his own right . Jacques-Louis Bertholdier was of medium height , between five nine and five eleven , certainly no more , but his bearing  --  the sheer straight shaft of his posture , the breadth of his shoulders and the length of his strong slender neck made him appear much taller , much more imposing than another might . He was among his own , and here , indeed , he was above the others , elevated by their own consensus . " Say something reverential , " said Mattilon , as Bertholdier approached , heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him and look tastefully awed . I 'll do the rest . " Converse did as he was told , uttering Bertholdier 's full name under his breath , but loud enough to be heard . He followed this quiet exclamation by leaning toward Mattilon and saying , " He 's a man I 've always wanted to meet . " There followed a brief exchange in French between Rene and his client , whereupon Luboque nodded , his expression that of an arrogant man willing to dispense a favor to a new friend . Bertholdier reached his chair , the maitre d ' and the dining room cap taro hovering on either side . The pavane took place less than four feet away  | " Mon general , " said Luboque , rising . " Serge , " replied Bertholdier , stepping forward , hand extended  --  a superior officer aware of a worthy subordinate 's disability . " Comment ca va ? " " Bien , Jacques . Et vous ? " " Les temps sont bien etranges , mon ami . " The greetings were brief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luboque , who gestured at Converse as he continued speaking . Instinctively Joel got to his feet , posture straight , his eyes level , unblinking , staring at Bertholdier , his look as piercing as the general 's professional but without awe . He had been right  --  in an unexpected way . The shared Southeast Asian experience had validity for Jacques-Louis Bertholdier . And why not ? He , too , had his memories . Mattilon was introduced almost as an afterthought , and the soldier gave a brief nod as he crossed behind Rene to shake hands with Joel . " A pleasure , Monsieur Simon , " said Bertholdier , his English precise , his grip firm , a comrade acknowledging another comrade , the man 's imperious charm instantly apparent . " I 'm sure you 've heard it thousands of times , sir , " said Joel , maintaining the steady , professional burn in his eyes , " but this is an occasion I never expected . If I may say so , General , it 's an honor to meet you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoined Bertholdier . " You gentlemen of the air did all you could , and I know something about the circumstances . So many missions ! I think it was easier on the ground ! " The general laughed quietly . " Gentlemen of the air " ? the man was unreal , thought Converse . But the connection was firm ; it was real , he felt it , he knew it . The combinaLion of words and looks had brought it about . So simple : a lawyer 's ruse , taming an adversary  --  in this case an enemy . The enemy . " I could n't agree with that , General ; it was a lot cleaner in the air . But if there 'd been more like you on the ground in Indochina , there never would have been a Dienbienphu . " " A flattering statement , but I 'm not sure it could stand the test of reality . " " I 'm sure , " said Joel quietly , clearly . " I 'm convinced of it . " I , uboque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mon general , voulez-vous vous joindre a nous ? " Pardonnez-moi . Je suis occupe avec mes visiteurs , " answered Bertholdier , turning back to Converse . " I must decline Rene 's invitation , I 'm expecting guests . He tells me you are an attorney , a specialist in aircraft litigation . " " It 's part of the broader field , yes . Air , ground , oceangoing craft  --  we  | try to represent the spectrum . Actually , I 'm fairly new at it  --  not the expertise , I hope  --  but the representation . " " I see , " said the general , obviously bewildered . " Are you in Paris on business ? " This was it , thought Joel . Above all , he would have to be subtle . The words  --  but especially the eyes  --  must convey the unspoken . " No , I 'm just here to catch my breath . I flew from San Francisco to New York and on to Paris . Tomorrow I 'll be in Bonn for a day or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow tiring for you . " Bertholdier was now returning his stare . " Not the worst , I 'm afraid , " said Converse , a half-smile on his lips . " After Tel Aviv , there 's a night flight to Johannesburg . " " Bonn , Tel Aviv , Johannesburg . . . " The soldier spoke softly . " A most unusual itinerary . " " Productive , we think . At least , we hope so . " " We ? " " My client , General . My new client . " " Deraisonnable ! " cried Mattilon , laughing at something Luboque had said , and , just as obviously , telling Joel he could no longer keep his impatient litigant in conversation . Bertholdier , however , did not take his eyes off Converse . " Where arc you staying , my young fighter-pilot friend ? " " Young and not so young , General . " " Where ? " " The George Cinq . Suite two-three-five . " " A fine establishment . " " It 's habit . My previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As in garrisoned ' ? " asked Bertholdier , a half-smile now on his lips . " An unconscious slip , " said Joel . " But then again , it says it , does n't it . sir ? " " It does , indeed . . . . Ah ha , my guests arrive ! " The soldier extended his hand . " It 's been a pleasure , Monsieur Simon . " Swift an revoir 's accompanied nods and rapid handshakes as Berthol dier returned to his table to greet his luncheon companions . Through Mattilon , Joel thanked Luboque for the introduction ; the disabled pilot gestured with both hands , palms up , and Converse had the distinct feelink : that he had been baptized . The insane three-sided dialogue then resumed at high speed , and it was all Joel could do to maintain even minimum concentration . Progress had been made ; it was in Bertholdier 's eyes , and he could feel those eves straying over to him even while the conversation at both tables  | became animated . The general was diagonally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either face , the line of sight between them was direct . ' l'wice it happened . The first time , Joel felt the forceful gaze resting on him as if magnified sunlight were burning into his flesh . He shifted his head barely an inch ; their eyes locked , the soldier 's penetrating , severe , questioning . The second time was a half-hour later , when the eye contact was initiated by Converse himself . Luboque and Mattilon were discussing legal strategy , and as if drawn by a magnet , Joel slowly turned to his left and watched Bertholdier , who was quietly , emphatically making a point with one of his guests . Suddenly , as a voice replied across the adjacent table , the general snapped his head in Converse 's direction , his eyes no longer questioning , only cold and ice-like . Then just as abruptly , there was warmth in them ; the celebrated soldier nodded , a half-smile on his face . Joel sat in the soft leather chair by the window in the dimly lit sitting room ; what light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alternately he stared at the telephone in front of the lamp and looked out the window at the weaving night traffic of Paris and the lights on the wide boulevard below . Then he focused entirely on the phone as he so frequently did when waiting for a call from a legal adversary he expected would capitulate , knowing that man or woman would capitulate . It was simply a question of time . What he expected now was communication , not capitulation  --  a connection , the connection . He had no idea what form it would take , but it would come . It had to come . It was nearly seven-thirty , four hours since he had left L'Etalon Blanc after a final , firm handshake exchanged with Jacques-Louis Bertholdier . The look in the soldier 's eyes was unmistakable : If nothing else , Converse reasoned , Bertholdier would have to satisfy his sheer curiosity . Joel had covered himself with the hotel 's front desk , distributing several well-placed ioo-franc notes . The tactic was not at all unusual in these days of national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even without the unrest . Visiting businessmen frequently chose to use pseudoIiyms for any number of reasons , ranging from negotiations best kept quiet to amorous engagements best left untraceable . In Converse 's case , the use of the name Simon made it appear logical , if not eminently respectable . If ' Talbot , Brooks and Simon preferred that all communications be made in the surname of one of the senior partners , who could question the decision ? Joel , however , carried the ploy one step further . After telephoning New York , he explained , he was told that his own name was not to be used at all ; no one knew he was in Paris and that was the way his firm  | wanted it . Obviously , the delayed instructions accounted for the mix-up in the reservation , which was void at any rate . There was to be no billing ; he would pay in cash , and since this was Paris , no one raised the slightest objection . Cash was infinitely preferable , delayed payment a national anathema . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The logic was sufficiently adequate and the franc notes persuasive ; the original registration card was torn up and another placed in the hotel file . H. Simon replaced J. Converse . The permanent address of the former was a figment of Joel 's imagination , a numbered house on a numbered street iii Chicago , Illinois , said house and said street most likely nonexistent . Anyone asking or calling for Mr. Converse  --  which was highly unlikely ? would be told no guest of that name was currently at the George V. Even Rene Mattilon was not a problem , for Joel had been specific . Since he had no further business in Paris , he was taking the six o'clock shuttle to London and staying with friends for several days before flying back to New York . He had thanked Rene profusely , telling the Frenchman that his firm 's fears about Bertholdier had been groundless . During their quiet conversation he had brought up three key names with the general , and each had been greeted with a blank look from Bertholdier , who apologized for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel had said . " I ca n't imagine why he would , " Mattilon had replied . I can , Converse had thought to himself . They call it Aquitaine . A crack ! There was a sudden sound , a harsh metallic snap , then another , and another  --  the tumblers of a lock falling out of place , a knob being turned . It came from beyond the open door to the bedroom . Joel bolted forward in his chair ; then , looking at his watch , just as rapidly he let out his breath and relaxed . It was the hour when the floor maid turned down the bed ; the tension of the expected call and what it represented had frayed his nerves . Again he leaned back , his gaze resting on the telephone . When would it ring ? Would it ring ? " Pardon , monsieur , " said a feminine voice , accompanied by a ligh t tapping on the open doorframe . Joel could not see the speaker . " Yes ? " Converse turned away from the silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What he saw made him gasp . It was the figure of Bertholdier , his posture erect , his angled head rigid , his eyes a strange admixture of cold . Ipt ) raisal , condescension , and  --  if Joel was not mistaken  --  a trace of foal I Ic walked through the door and stood motionless ; when he spoke his voice was a rippling sheet of ice .  | " I was on my way to a dinner engagement on the fourth floor , Monsieur Simon . By chance , I remembered you were in this very hotel . You did give me the number of your suite . Do I intrude ? " " Of course not , General , " said Converse , on his feet . " Did you expect me ? " " Not this way . " " But you did expect me ? " Joel paused . " Yes . " " A signal sent and received ? " Again Joel paused . " Yes . " " You are either a provocatively subtle attorney or a strangely obsessed Iran . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoked you into coming to see me and I was subtle about it , Ill accept that gladly . As to being obsessed , the word implies an exaggerated or unwarranted concern . Whatever concerns I have , I know damned well they 're neither exaggerated nor unwarranted . No obsession , General . I 'm too good a lawyer for that . " " A pilot can not lie to himself . If he does so blindly , he crashes to his death . " " I 've been shot down . I 've never crashed through pilot error . " Bertholdier walked slowly to the brocaded couch against the wall . " Bonn , Tel Aviv , and Johannesburg , " he said quietly as he sat down and crossed his legs . " The signal ? " " The signal . " " My company has interests in those areas . " " So does my client , " said Converse . " And what do you have , Monsieur Simon ? " Joel stared at the soldier . " A commitment , General . " Bertholdier was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May I have a brandy ? " he said finally . " My escort will remain in the corridor outside this door . "  | Converse walked to the dry bar against the wall , conscious of the soldier 's gaze , wondering which tack the conversation would take . He was oddly calm , as he frequently was before a merger conference or a pretrial examination , knowing he knew things his adversaries were not aware of  --  buried information that had surfaced through long hours of hard work . In the present circumstances there had been no work at all on his part , but the results were the same . He knew a great deal about the legend across the room named Jacques-Louis Bertholdier . In a word , Joel was prepared , and over the years he had learned to trust his on-the-feet instincts  --  as he had once trusted those that had guided him through the skies years ago . Also , as it was part of his job , he was familiar with the legal intricacies of import-export manipulations . They were a maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and during the next few minutes he intended to baffle this disciple of Georg ( Marcus Delavane  --  warlord of Saigon  --  until the soldier 's trace of fear became something far more pronounced . Clearances for foreign shipments came in a wide variety of shapes and colors , from the basic export license with specific bills of lading to those with the less specific generic limitations . Then there were the more coveted licenses required for a wide variety of products subject to govern mental reviews ; these were usually shunted back and forth between vacil  | ! luting departments until deadlines forced bureaucratic decisions often based on whose influence was the strongest or who among the bureaucrats were the weakest . Finally , there was the most lethal authorization of all , a document too frequently conceived in corruption and delivered in blood . It was called the End-User 's Certificate , an innocuously named permit that was a license to ship the most abusive merchandise in the nation 's arsenals into air and sea lanes beyond the controls of those who should have them . l 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments with shared objectives , thus the " use " at the discretion of the parties at the receiving " end " ? calculated death legitimized by a " certifiCate " that obfuscated everyone 's intentions . But once the equipment was ml route , diversion was the practice . Shipments destined for the Bay of aifa or Alexandria would find their way to the Gulf of Sidra and a madman in Libya , or an assassin named Carlos training killer teams anywhere from Beirut to the Sahara . Fictional corporations with nonexistcut yet strangely influential officers operated through obscure brokers and out of hastily constructed or out-of-the-way warehouses in the U.S. and " jbroad . Millions upon millions were to be made ; death was an unimpornt consequence and there was a phrase for it all . Boardroom terrorism . fit , and it would be Aquitaine 's method . There was no other . " These were the thoughts  --  the methods of operation  --  that flashed through Converse 's mind as he poured the drinks . He was ready ; he turned and walked across the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Bertholdier , taking brandy from Converse . " Information , General . " " About what ? " " World markets  --  expanding markets that my client might service . " foci crossed back to the chair by the window and sat down . " And what sort of service does he render ? " " Ile 's a broker . " " Of what ? " " A wide range of products . " Converse brought his glass to his lips ; he drank , then added , " I think I mentioned them in general terms at your cllkb this afternoon . Planes , vehicles , oceangoing craft , munitions mateThe spectrum . " " Yes , you did . I 'm afraid I did not understand . " " My client has access to production and warehouse sources beyond anyone I 've ever known or ever heard of . " " Very impressive . Who is he ? "  | " I 'm not at liberty to say . " " Perhaps I know him . " " You might , but not in the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area , it 's nonexistent . " " And you wo n't tell me who he is , " said Bertholdier . " It 's privileged information . " " Yet , in your own words , you sought me out , sent a signal to which I responded , and now say you want information concerning expanding markets for all manner of merchandise , including Bonn , Tel Aviv , and Johannesburg . But you wo n't divulge the name of your client who will benefit if I have this information  --  which I probably do not . Surely , you ca n't he serious . " " You have the information and , yes , I 'm very serious . But I 'm afraid you 've jumped to the wrong conclusion . " " I have no fear of it at all . My English is fluent and I heard what you said . You came out of nowhere , I know nothing about you , you speak elusively of this unnamed influential man ? " " You asked me , General , " interrupted Joel firmly without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you said information . " " Yes , I did , but I did n't say I was seeking it from you . " " I beg your pardon ? " " Under the circumstances  --  for the reasons you just mentioned  --  you would n't give it to me anyway , and I 'm well aware of that . " " Then what is the point of this  --  shall I say , induced  --  conversation ' I do not like my time trifled with , monsieur . " " That 's the last thing on earth we 'd do  --  I 'd do . " " Please be specific . " " My client wants your trust . I want it . But we know it ca n't be given until you feel it 's justified . In a few days  --  a week at the outside  --  I hope to prove that it is . " " By trips to Bonn , Tel Aviv  --  Johannesburg ? " " Frankly , yes . " " Why ? " " You said it a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He shrugged too casually ; he was pulliriy ; hack . " I said it because my company has considerable investments those areas . I thought it was entirely plausible you had a proposition , or propositions , to make relative to those interests . " " I intend to have . " " Please be specific , " said the soldier , controlling his irritation . " You know I ca n't , " replied Joel . " Not yet "  | " When ? " " When it 's clear to you  --  all of you  --  that my client , and by extension myself , have as strong motives for being a part of you as the most dedicated among you . " " A part of my company ? Juneau et Compagnie ? " " Forgive me , General , I wo n't bother to answer that . " Bertholdier glanced at the brandy in his hand , then back at Converse . " You say you flew from San Francisco . " " I 'm not based there , " Joel broke in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why were you there ? " " I 'll answer that if for no other reason than to show you how thorough we are  --  and how much more thorough others are . We traced  --  I traced ? overseas shipments back to export licenses originating in the northern California area . The licensees were companies with no histories and warehouses with no records  --  chains of four walls erected for brief , temporary periods of convenience . It was a mass of confusion leading nowhere and everywhere . Names on documents where no such people existed , documents themselves that came out of bureaucratic labyrinths virtually untraceable  --  rubber stamps , official seals , and signatures of authorization where no authority was granted . Unknowing middle-level personnel told to expedite departmental clearances ? That 's what I found in San Francisco . A morass of complex , highly questionable transactions that could not bear intense scrutiny . " Bertholdier 's eyes were fixed , too controlled . " I would know nothing about such things , of course , " he said . " Of course , " agreed Converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through me  --  and the additional fact that neither he nor I have any desire whatsoever to call attention to them must tell you something . " " Frankly , not a thing . " " Please , General . One of the first principles of free enterprise is to cripple your competition , step in , and fill the void . " The soldier drank , gripping the glass firmly . He lowered it and spoke . " Why did you come to me ? " " Because you were there . " " What ? " " Your name was there  --  among the morass , way down deep , but there . " Bertholdier shot forward . " Impossible ! Preposterous ! " " Then why am I here ? Why are you here ? " Joel placed his glass on the table by the chair , the movement that of a man not finished speaking . " Try to understand me . Depending upon which government department a person 's dealing with , certain recommendations are bound to be helpful . You would n't do a damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but over at the State Department 's Munitions Controls or at Pentagon procurements , you 're golden . " " I have never lent my name to any such appeals . " " Others did . Men whose recommendations carried a lot of weight , but who perhaps needed extra clout . " " What do you mean ? This clout . ' " " A final push for an affirmative decision  --  without any apparent personal involvement . It 's called support for an action through viable second and third parties . For instance , a memo might read : ' We ' ? the department , not a person ? ' do n't know much about this , but if a man like General Bertholdier is favorably disposed , and we are informed that he is , why should we argue ? ' " " Never . It could not happen . " " It did , " said Converse softly , knowing it was the moment to bring in reality to support his abstractions . He would be able to tell instantly if Beale was right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chaos in the cities and towns of a violently upended Northern Ireland . " You were there , not often but enough for me to find you . Just as you were there in a different way when a shipment was air-freighted out of Beloit , Wisconsin , on its way to Tel Aviv . Of course it never got there . Somehow it was diverted to maniacs on both sides in Belfast . I wonder where it happened ? Montreal ? Paris ? Marseilles ? The Separatists in Quebec would certainly follow your orders , as would men in Paris and Marseilles . It 's a shame a company named Solidaire had to pay off the insurance claim . Oh , yes , you 're a director of the firm , are n't you ? And it 's so convenient that insurance carriers have access to the merchandise they cover . " Bertholdier was frozen to the chair , the muscles of his face pulsating , his eyes wide , staring at Joel . His guilt was suppressed , but no less apparent for that control . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocking and incredible ! " " I repeat , why am I here ? " " Only you can answer that , monsieur , " said Bertholdier , abruptly getting to his feet , the brandy in his hand . Then slowly , with military precision , he leaned over and placed the glass on the coffee table ; it was a gesture of finality  --  the conference was over . " Quite obviously I made a foolish error , " he continued , shoulders square again and head rigid , but now with a strained yet oddly convincing smile on his lips . " I am a soldier , not a businessman ; it is a late direction in my life . A soldier tries to seize in Initiative and I attempted to do just that ; only , there was  --  there is ? In1 nutiative . Forgive mc , I misread your signal this afternoon . "  | " You did n't misread anything , General . " " Am I contradicted by a stranger  --  I might even say a devious stranger ? who arranges a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my honor and my conduct ? I think not . " As Bertholdier strode across the room toward the hallway door Joel rose from his chair . " Do n't bother , monsieur , I 'll let myself out . You 've gone to enough trouble , for what purpose I have n't the faintest idea . " " I 'm on my way to Bonn , " said Converse . " Tell your friends I 'm coming . Tell them to expect me . And please , General , tell them not to prejudge me . I mean that . " " Your elliptical references are most annoying  --  Lieutenant . It was lieutenant , ' was n't it ? Unless you also deceived poor Luboque as well . " " Whatever deception I employed to meet you can only be for his benefit . I 've offered to write a legal opinion for his case . He may not like it , but it 'll save him a lot of pain and money . And I have not deceived you . " A matter of judgment , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob . " Bonn , Germany , " pressed Joel . " I heard you . I have n't the vaguest notion what you ? " " Leifhelm , " said Converse quietly . " Erich Leifhelm . " The soldier 's head turned slowly ; his eyes were banked fires , the coals glowing , about to erupt at the merest gust of wind . " A name known to me , but not the man . " " Tell him I 'm coming . " " Good night , monsieur , " said Bertholdier , opening the door , his face ashen . Joel raced into the bedroom , grabbed his suitcase and threw it on the luggage rack . He had to get out of Paris . Within hours , perhaps minutes , Bertholdier would have him watched , and if he was followed to an airport , his passport would expose the name Simon as a lie . He could not let that happen , not yet . It was strange , unsettling . He had never had any reason to leave a hotel surreptitiously , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  only that it had to be done . The altering of the registration card had been done instinctively ; there were occasions when legal negotiations had to be kept quiet for everyone 's benefit . But this was different  --  it was abnormal . He had said to Beale on Mykonos that he was going to become someone he was not . It was an easy thing to say , not at all easy to do . I its suitcase packed , he checked the battery charge on his electric razor  | and absently turned it on , moving it around his chin , as he walked to the bedside telephone . He shut the switch off as he dialed , unsure of what he would say to the night concierge but nevertheless instinctively orienting his mind to a business approach . After initial remarks , mutually flattering , the words came . " There 's an extremely sensitive situation , and my firm is anxious that I leave for London just as soon as possible  --  and as discreetly as possible . Frankly , I would prefer not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is honored here , and haste is a normal request . I shall come up and present your bill myself . Say , ten minutes ? " " I 've only one piece of luggage . I 'll carry it , but I 'll need a cab . Not in front . " " Not in front , of course . The freight elevator , monsieur . It connects below with our corridor for deliveries . Arrangements will be made . " " I 've made arrangements ! " said Bertholdier harshly into the limousine 's mobile phone , the glass partition between him and the chauffeur tightly shut . " One man remains in the gallery in sight of the elevators , another in the cellars where the hotel supplies are brought in . If he attempts to leave during the night , it is the only other exit available to him . I 've used it myself on several occasions . " " This . . . is all most difficult to absorb . " The voice on the line spoke with a clipped British accent , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly afraid . " Are you sure ? Could there be some other linkage ? " " Imbecile ! I repeat . He knew about the munitions shipment from Beloit ! He knew the routing , even the method of theft . He went so far as to identify Solidaire and my position as a board member ! He made a direct reference to our business associate in Bonn ! Then to Tel Aviv ... Johannesburg ! What other linkage could there be ? " " Corporate entanglements , perhaps . One ca n't rule them out . Multinational subsidiaries , munitions investments , our associate in West Germany also sits on several boards . . . . And the locations  --  money pours into them . " " What in the name of God do you think I 'm talking about ? I can say no more now , but what I 've told you , my English flower , take it to be the worst ! " There was a brief silence from London . " I understand , " said the voice of a subordinate rebuked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . His name is Simon , I Icnry Simon I Ic 's an attorney from Chicago . I have the address ; it 's from  | the hotel 's registration file . " Bertholdier squinted under the glare of the reading lamp , haltingly deciphering the numbers and the numbered street written down by an assistant bell captain , well paid by one of the general 's men to go into the office and obtain information on the occupant of suite two-three-five . " Do you have that ? " " Yes . " The voice was now sharp , a subordinate about to redress a grievance . " Was it wise to get it that way ? A friend or a greedy employee - night tell him someone was inquiring about him . " " Really , my British daffodil ? An innocuous bellboy checking the registry so as to post a lost garment to a recent guest ? " Again the brief silence . " Yes , I see . You know , Jacques , we work for a great cause  --  a business cause , of course  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once years ago . I must constantly remind myself of that , or I do n't think I could tolerate your insults . " " And what would be your recourse , l'Anglais ? " " To cut your arrogant Frog balls off in Trafalgar Square and stuff them in a lion 's mouth . The repository would n't have to be large ; an ancient crack would do . I 'll ring you up in an hour or so . " There was a click and the line went dead . The soldier lowered the mobile phone in his hand , and a smile slowly emerged on his lips . They were the best , all of them ! They were the hope , the only hope of a very sick world . Then the smile faded , the blood again draining from his face , arrogance turning into fear . What did this Henry Simon want , really want ? Who was the unknown man with access to extraordinary sources  --  planes , vehicles , munitions ? What in God 's name did they know ? The padded elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage , its speed adjusted for room-service deliveries . The night concierge stood beside Joel , his face pleasantly impassive ; in his right hand was the leather bourse containing a copy of Converse 's bill and the franc notes covering it  --  as well as a substantial gratuity for the Frenchman 's courtesy . A slight whirring sound preceded the stop ; the panel light shone behind the letters sou-soL , and the heavy doors parted . Beyond in the wide hallway was a platoon of white-jacketed waiters , maids , porters and a few maintenance personnel commandeering tables , racks of linens , luggage and assorted cleaning materials . Loud , rapid chatter , heightened by bursts of laughter and guttural expletives , accompanied the bustling activity . At the sight of the concierge there was a perceptible lessening of volume and any increase of concentrated movement , along with nods and fawning  | smiles directed at the man who , with the flick of a pen , could eliminate their jobs . " If you 'll just point me in the right direction , I 'll be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call further attention to himself in the company of the concierge . " I 've taken up too much of your time . " " Merci . I f you will follow that corridor , it will lead to the service exit , " replied the Frenchman , pointing to a hallway on the left , beyond the bank of elevators . " The guard is at his desk and is aware of your departure . Outside in the alley , turn right and walk to the street ; your taxi is waiting for you . " " I appreciate  --  my firm appreciates  --  your cooperation . As I mentioned upstairs , there 's nothing really that secretive , or unusual  --  just sensitive . " The hotel man 's impassive countenance did not change , except for a slightly sharper focus in his eyes . " It is of no matter , monsieur , an explanation is not required . I did not request it , and if you 'll forgive me , you should not feel an obligation to offer one . Au revoir , Monsieur Simon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maintaining his composure though he felt like a schoolboy admonished for speaking out of turn , for offering an answer when he had not been called upon . " See you next time I 'm in Paris . " " We await the day , monsieur . Bonsoir . " Joel turned quickly , making his way through the uniformed crowd toward the hallway , apologizing whenever his suitcase made contact with a body . He had just been taught a lesson , one he should not have had to learn . He knew it in a courtroom and in conference : Never explain what you do n't have to . Shut up . But this was not a court or a conference . It was , it suddenly dawned on him , an escape , and the realization was a little frightening , certainly very strange . Or was it ? Escape was in his vocabulary , in his experience . He had tried it three times before in his life  --  years ago . And death had been everywhere . He put the thought out of his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance . He slowed down ; something was wrong . Ahead , standing in front of the security desk talking to the guard was a man in a light-colored topcoat . Joel had seen him before but he did not know where ; then the man moved and Converse began to remember  --  an image came back to him . Another man had moved the same way  --  taking several steps backward before turning  --  to disappear from an archway , and now he moved the same way to cross the corridor to lean against the wall . Was it the same man ? Yes ! It was the one who had accompanied Bertholdier to the dining-room entrance of L'Etalon Blanc . The subordinate who had taken leave of a superior then was here now under orders from that same superior .  | The man looked up , the flash of recognition instantly in his eyes . Stretching , he raised himself to his full height and turned away , his hand slowly moving toward the fold in his coat . Converse was stunned . Was the man actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten feet away ? It was insane ! Joel stopped ; he considered racing back into the crowd by the elevators but knew it was pointless . If Bertholdier had posted a watchdog in the basement , others would be upstairs , in the corridors , in the lobby . He could not turn and run ; there was no place to go , nowhere to hide . So he kept walking , now faster , directly toward the man in the light-brown topcoat , his mind confused , his throat tight . " There you are ! " he cried out loud , not sure the words were his . " The general told me where to find you ! " The man stood motionless , in shock , speechless . " Le general ? " he said , barely above a whisper . " He . . . tell you ? " The man 's English was not good , and that was very good . He could understand , but not well . Rapidly spoken words , persuasively delivered , might get them both out the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his companion 's back . " My name 's Simon . I believe the concierge spoke to you about me . " The juxtaposition of the name and the title was sufficient for the bewildered guard . He glanced at his papers , nodding . " Oui , monsieur . Le concierge . . . " Come on ! " Converse shoved the attache case into the man in the topcoat , propelling him toward the door . " The general 's waiting for us outside . Let 's go ! Hurry up ! " " Le general . . . ? " The man 's hands instinctively shot out at the crash bar of the exit door ; in less than five seconds he and Joel were alone in the alley . " Que se passe-t-il ? Ou est le general ? . . . Where ? " " Here ! He said to wait here . You . You 're to wait here ! kit " " Arretez ! " The man was recovering . He stood his ground . Thrusting his left hand out , he pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached into his overcoat . " Do n't ! " Joel dropped his attache case , gripping his suitcase and pulling it up in front of him , about to rush forward . He stopped . The man did not pull out a gun ; instead , what he had was a thin rectangular object bound in black leather , from which a long metallic needle rose from the narrow flat top . An antenna . . . a radio ! All thought was blurred for Converse , but he knew he had to act instantly  --  only motion counted . He could not permit the man to use that radio , alerting those with other radios elsewhere in the hotel . With a sudden surge of strength he rammed his suitcase into the man 's knees ,  | tearing the radio away with his left hand , whipping his right arm out and over the man 's shoulder . He crooked his elbow around the Frenchman 's neck as he spun on the pavement . Then without thinking , he yanked Bertholdier 's soldier forward , so that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's head into the stone . Blood spread throughout the Frenchman 's skull , matting his hair and streaking down his face in deep-red rivulets . Joel could not think , he could not allow himself to think . If he did , he would be sick and he knew it . Motion , motion ! The man went limp . Converse angled the unconscious body by the shoulders , propelling it against the wall , shoving it away from the metal door and letting it drop in the farther shadows . He leaned down and picked up the radio ; he snapped off the antenna and shoved the case into his pocket . He stood up , confused , frightened , trying to orient himself . Then , grabbing his attache case and suitcase , he raced breathlessly out of the alley , conscious of the blood that had somehow erupted over part of his face . The taxi was at the curb , the driver smoking a cigarette in the darkness , oblivious to the violence that had taken place only thirty yards away . " De Gaulle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing his luggage inside . " Please , I 'm in a hurry ! " He lurched into the seat , gasping , his neck stretched above the cushioned rim , swallowing the air that would not fill his lungs . The rushing lights and shadows that bombarded the interior of the cab served to keep his thoughts suspended , allowing his racing pulse to decelerate and the air to reach him , slowly drying the perspiration at his temples and his neck . He leaned forward , wanting a cigarette but afraid he would vomit from the smoke trapped in his throat . He shut his eyes so tightly a thousand specks of white light assaulted the dark screen of his mind . He felt ill , and he knew it was not simply fear alone that had brought on the nausea . It was something else , something that was in and of itself as paralyzing as fear . He had committed an act of utter brutality , and it both shocked and appalled him . He had actually physically attacked a man , wanting to cripple him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . No matter why , he may have killed another human being ! Did the presence of a hand-held radio justify a shattered skull ? Did it constitute self-defense ? Goddamn it , he was a man of words , of logic , not blood ! Never blood , that was in the past , so long ago and so painful . Those memories belonged to another time , to an uncivilized time , when men became what they were not  --  in order to survive . Converse never wanted to go back . Above all things , he had promised himself he never would , a promise he made when the terror and the violence were all around  | him , at their shattering worst . He remembered so vividly , with such pain , the final hours before his last escape  --  and the quiet ; generous man without whom he would have died twenty feet down in the earth , a shaft in the ground designed for troublemakers . Colonel Sam Abbott , US . Air Force , would always be a part of his life no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of torture and death , Sam had crawled out at night and had thrown a crudely fashioned metal wedge down the " punishment hole " ; it was that primitive tool that allowed Joel to build a crude ladder out of earth and rock and finally to freedom . Abbott and he had spent the last twenty-seven months in the same camp , both officers trying to hold together what sanity there was . But Sam understood the burning inside Joel ; the Colonel had stayed behind , and during those final hours before breakout , Joel was wracked by the thoughts of what might happen to his friend . " Do n't worry about me , sailor . Just keep your minimum wits about you and get rid of that wedge . Take care , Sam . You take care . This is the last shot you 've got . I know . Joel moved over toward the door and rolled down the window several inches more to increase the rush of wind from the highway . Christ , he needed Sam Abbott 's quiet objectivity now ! His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had to think and his thoughts had to stimulate whatever imagination he had . First things first . Think ! The radio  --  he had to get rid of the radio . But not at the airport  --  it might be found in the airport ; it was evidence , and worse , a means of tracing him . He rolled the window further down and threw it out , his eyes on the rearview mirror above the windshield . The driver glanced up at him , saw the bloody face but showed no alarm ; Joel took repeated deep breaths and then rolled the window back up . Think . He had to think ! Bertholdier expected him to go from Paris to Bonn and when the general 's soldier was found  --  and he had undoubtedly been found by now  --  all flights to Bonn would be watched , whether the man was alive or dead . He would buy a ticket for somewhere else , someplace where connections to Cologne-Bonn were accessible on a regular basis . As the stream of air cooled his face it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and wipe away the moist blood that covered his right check and lower chin . " Scandinavian Air Lines , " he said , raising his voice to the driver . " SAS . Do you . . . comprends ? " " Very clearly , monsieur , " said the bereted man behind the wheel in  | good English . " Do you have a reservation for Stockholm , Oslo , or Copenhagen ? They are different gates . " " I 'm . . . I 'm not sure . " " We have time , monsieur . At least fifteen minutes . " The voice over the telephone from London was frigid , the words and the delivery an impersonal rebuke . " There is no attorney by that name in Chicago , and certainly not at the address you gave me . In fact , the address does not exist . Do you have something else to offer , or do we put this down as one of your more paranoid fantasies , mon general ? " " You are a fool , l'Anglais , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I heard ! " " From whom ? A nonexistent man ? " " A nonexistent man who has put my aide in a hospital ! A fractured skull with a great loss of blood and severe brain damage . He may not live , and if he does , he will no doubt be a vegetable . Speak to me not of fantasies , daffodil . The man is real . " " Are you serious ? " " Call the hospital ! L'hopital Saint-Jerome . Let the doctors tell you . " " All right , all right , compose yourself . We must think . " " I am perfectly composed , " said Bertholdier , getting up from the desk in his study and carrying the phone to the window , the extension cord snaking across the floor . He looked out ; it had begun to rain , the street lights diffused in the spattered glass . " He 's on his way to Bonn , " continued the general . " It was his next stop , he was very clear about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give them his description . How many flights can there be from Paris with a lone American on board ? Take him at the airport . " Bertholdier sighed audibly into the phone , his tone one of discouragement bordering on disgust . " It was never my intention to take him . It would serve no purpose and probably cut us off from what we have to learn . I want him followed . I want to know where he goes , whom he calls , whom he meets with ; these are the things we must learn . " " You said he made a direct reference to our associate . That he was going to reach him . " " Not our people . His people . " " I 'll say it again , " insisted the voice from London . " Call Cologne , reach Bonn . Listen to me , Jacques , he can be found , and once he is , he can be followed . " " Yes , yes , I 'll do as you say , but it may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have thought otherwise , but that was before I knew  | what he was capable of . Someone who can take another man and rush that man 's head into a stone wall at full force is either an animal , a maniac , or a zealot who will stop at nothing . In my judgment , he is the last . He said he had a commitment  --  and it was in his eyes . And he 'll be clever ; he 's already proven he can be clever . " " You say three hours ? " " Yes . " " Then he may already be in Bonn . " " I know . " " Have you called our associate ? " " Yes , he 's not at home and the maid could not give me another number . She does n't know where he is , or when he 's expected . " " Probably in the morning . " " No doubt . . . . Attendez ! There was another man at the club this afternoon . With Luboque and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Luboque ! Good-bye , l'Anglais . I 'll keep you informed . " Rene Mattilon opened his eyes . The streaks of light on the ceiling seemed to shimmer , myriad tiny clots bursting , breaking up the linear patterns . Then he heard the sound of the rain on the windows and understood . The shafts of light from the streetlamps had been intercepted by the glass , distorting the images he knew so well . It was the rain , he concluded ; that was what had awakened him . That and perhaps the weight of his wife 's hand between his legs . She stirred and he smiled , trying to make up his mind  --  or find the energy  --  to reach for her . She had filled a void for him he had thought would always be there after his first wife died . He was grateful , and along with his feeling of gratitude came excitement , two emotions satisfyingly compatible . He was becoming aroused ; he rolled over on his side and pulled down the covers , revealing the swell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pounding on the windows heightening the sensuality . He reached for her . Suddenly , there was another sound besides the rain , and though still wrapped in the mists of sleep he recognized it . Quickly he withdrew his hand and turned away from his wife . He had heard that noise only ni nnents before ; it was the sound that had awakened him , an insistent tonne that had broken the steady rhythm of the downpour : the chimes of his apartment doorbell . Mattilon climbed out of bed as carefully as he could , reaching for his bathrobe on a nearby chair and sliding his feet into his slippers . He walked out of the bedroom , closing the door quietly behind him , and found the wall switch that turned on the lamps in the living room . He glanced at  | the ornate clock on the fireplace mantel ; it was nearly two-thirty in the morning . Who could possibly be calling on them at this hour ? He tied the sash around his robe and walked to the door . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inspector Prudliomme . My state identification is zero-five-seven-two-zero . " The man 's accent was Gascon , not Parisian . It was often said that Gascons made the best police officials . " I shall wait while you call my station , monsieur . The telephone number is ? " " No need , " said Mattilon , alarmed , unlatching the door . He knew the man was genuine not only from the information offered , but anyone from the Surete calling on him at this hour would know he was an attorney . The Surete was legally circumspect . There were two men , both in raincoats spotted by the downpour , their hats drenched ; one was older than the other and shorter . Each held out an open identification card for Rene 's inspection . He waved the cards aside and gestured for the two men to come in , adding , " It 's an odd time for visitors , gentlemen . You must have pressing business . " " Very pressing , monsieur , " said the older man , entering first . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving his name as Prudhomme , and was obviously the senior . " We apologize for the inconvenience , of course . " Both men removed their hats . " Of course . May I take your coats ? " " It wo n't be necessary , monsieur . With your cooperation we 'll only be a few minutes . " " And I shall be most interested to know how I can cooperate with the Surete at this time of night . " " A matter of identification , sir . Monsieur Serge Antoine Luboque is a client of yours , we are informed . Is this so ? " " My God , has something happened to Serge ? I was with him only this afternoon ! " " Monsieur Luboque appears to be in excellent health . We left his country house barely an hour ago . And to the point , it is your meeting with him this afternoon yesterday afternoon  --  that concerns the Surete . " " In what way ? " " There was a third party at your table . Like yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Simon . Henry Simon , an American . " " And a pilot , " said Mattilon warily . " With considerable expertise in aircraft litigation . I trust Luhoque explained that ; it was the reason he was there at my request . Monsieur Luboque is the plaintiff in just such a lawsuit That , of course , is all I can say on the subject . "  | " It is not the subject that interests the Surete . " " What is , then ? " " There is no attorney by the name of Henry Simon in the city of Chicago , Illinois , in the United States . " " I find that hard to believe . " " The name is false . At least , it is not his . The address he gave the hotel does not exist . " " The address he gave the hotel ? " asked Rene , astonished . Joel did not have to give an address to the George V  --  it knew him well , knew the firm of Talbot , Brooks and Simon very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Prudhomme . " The night concierge was very cooperative . He told us he escorted Monsieur Simon down the freight elevator to the hotel cellars . " " The cellars ? " " Monsieur Simon wished to leave the hotel without being seen . He paid his bill in his room . " " A minute , please , " said Mattilon , perplexed , his hands protesting , as he turned and walked aimlessly around an armchair . He stopped , his hands on the rim . " What precisely do you want from me ? " " We want you to help us , " answered Prudhomme . " We think you know who he is . You brought him to Monsieur Luboque . " " On a confidential matter entailing a legal opinion . He agreed to listen and to evaluate on the condition that his identity be protected . It 's not unusual when seeking expertise if one is involved with , shall we say , an individual as wealthy and as temperamental as Monsieur Luboque . You 've spoken with him ; need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the older man from the Surete , permitting himself a smile . " He thinks all government personnel work for Moscow . We were surrounded by dogs in his foyer , all salivating , I might add . " " Then you can understand why my American colleague prefers to remain unnamed . I know him well , he 's a splendid man . " " Who is he ? And do you know where we can find him ? " " Why do you want him ? " " We wish to question him about an incident that took place at the hotel . " " I 'm sorry . As Luboque is a client , so by extension is Simon . " " That is not acceptable to us under the circumstances , monsieur . " " I 'm afraid it will have to be , at least for a few hours . Tomorrow I shall try to reach him through his office in . . . in the United States , and I 'm sure he 'll get in touch with you immediately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " Prudhomme glanced at his starchly postured associate and shrugged . " He may have killed a man , " he said matter-of-factly . Mattilon stared at the Surete officer in disbelief . " He . . . what ? " " It was a particularly vicious assault , monsieur . A man 's head was rammed into a wall ; there are extensive cranial injuries and the prognosis is not good . His condition as of midnight was critical , the chances of recovery less than half . He may be dead by now , which one doctor said could be a blessing . " " No ... no ! You are mistaken ! You 're wrong ! " The lawyer 's hands gripped the back of the chair . " A terrible error has been made ! " " No error . The identification was positive  --  that is , Monsieur Simon was identified as the last person seen with the man who was beaten . He forced the man out into an alley ; there were sounds of scuffling and minutes later that man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " " Impossible ! You do n't know him ! What you suggest is inconceivable . He could n't . " " Are you telling us he is disabled , physically incapable of assault ? " " No , " said Mattilon , shaking his head . Then suddenly he stopped all movement . " Yes , " he continued thoughtfully , his eyes pensive , now nodding , rushing ahead . " He 's incapable , yes , but not physically . Mentally . In that sense he is disabled . He could not do what you say he did . " " He 's mentally deranged ? " " My God , no ! He 's one of the most lucid men I 've ever met . You have to understand . He went through a prolonged period of extreme physical stress and mental anguish . He endured punishment , to both his body and his mind . There was no permanent damage but there are indelible memories . Like so many men who 've been subjected to such treatment , he avoids all forms of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ca n't inflict punishment because too much was inflicted on him . " " You mean he would not defend himself , his own ? He would turn the other cheek if he , or his wife , or his children were attacked ? " " Of course not , but that 's not what you described . You said ' a particularly vicious assault , ' implying something quite different . And if it were otherwise  --  if he were threatened or attacked and defended himself  --  he most certainly would not have left the scene . He 's too fine a lawyer . " Mattilon paused . " Was that the case ? Is that what you 're saying ? Is the injured man known to you from the police files ? Is he ? "  | " A limousine chauffeur , " interrupted Prudhomme . " An unarmed man who was waiting for his assigned passenger of the evening . " " In the cellars ? " " Apparently it is a customary service and not an unfamiliar one . These firms are discreet . This one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee 's condition . The client would not know . " " Very chic , I 'm sure . What do they say happened ? " " According to a witness , a guard who 's been with the hotel for eighteen years , this Simon approached in a loud voice , speaking English  --  the guard thinks angrily , although he does not understand the language  --  and forced the man outside . " " The guard is wrong ! It had to be someone else . " " Simon identified himself . The concierge had cleared his departure . The description fits ; it was the one who called himself Simon . " " But why ? There has to be a reason ! " " We should like to hear it , monsieur . " Rene shook his head in bewilderment ; nothing made sense . A man could register at any hotel under any name he wished , of course , but there were charges , credit cards , people calling ; a false name served no purpose . Especially at a hotel where one was presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel incognito , that status would not be protected if a front desk was questioned by the Surete . " I must ask you again , Inspector , have you checked thoroughly with the hotel ? " " Not personally , monsieur , " replied Prudhomme , looking at his associate . " My time was taken up interrogating those in the vicinity of the assault . " " I checked with the concierge myself , monsieur , " said the younger , taller man , speaking like a programmed robot . " Naturally , the hotel is not anxious for the incident to receive attention , but the management was cooperative . The night concierge is newly employed from the Hotel Meurice and wished to minimize the incident , but he himself showed me the registration form . " " I see . " And Mattilon did see , at least insofar as Joel 's identity was concerned . Hundreds of guests at a large hotel and a nervous concierge protecting his new employer 's image . The obvious source was accepted as truth , another truth no doubt forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all Rene understood  --  nothing else . He needed a few moments to think , to try to understand . " I 'm curious , " he said , reaching for words . " At worst , this is an assault with severe results , but nevertheless an assault . Why is n't it a simple police matter ? Why the Surete ? "  | " My first question , monsieur , " said the plainspoken Prudhomme . " The reason given us was that the incident involved a foreigner , obviously a wealthy foreigner . One does not know these days where such things may lead . We have certain controls not available to the arrondissement police . " " I see . " " Do you ? " asked the man from the Surete . " May I remind you that as an attorney you have an obligation to uphold the courts and the law ? You have been offered our credentials and I have suggested you call my station for any further verification you might wish . Please , monsieur , who is I leery Simon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inspector . To my word , to a client , to an old friendship ? " " You put these above the law ? " " Only because I know you 're wrong . " " Then where is the harm ? If we are wrong , we shall find this Simon undoubtedly at an airport and he will tell us himself . But if we are not , we may find a very sick man who needs help . Before he harms others . I am no psychiatrist , monsieur , but you have described a troubled man ? a once troubled man , in any event . " Mattilon was uncomfortable with the blunt official 's logic . . . and also something else he could not define . Was it Joel ? Was it the clouds in his old friend 's eyes , the unconscious verbal slip about a blemished rock in the dirt ? Rene looked again at the clock on the mantel ; a thought occurred to him . It was only eight-forty-two in New York . " Inspector , I 'm going to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a phone call on my private line . The line , incidentally , is not connected to the telephone on the table . " " That was unnecessary , monsieur . " " Then I apologize . " Mattilon walked rapidly to a door on the opposite side of the room , opened it and went inside . He crossed to his desk , where he sat down and opened a red-leather telephone index . He flipped the pages to the letter T , scanning the names until he reached Talbot , Lawrence . He had both the office and the house number ; the latter was necessary because the courts in Paris were in operation before the East Coast of America was out of bed . If Talbot was not there , he would try Nathan Simon , then Brooks , if he had to . Neither alternative was necessary . Lawrence Talbot answered the phone . " I 'll be damned , how are you , Rene ? You in New York ? " " ' , No , Paris . "  | " Sounds like you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's always startling . " " It 's also late where you are , if I 'm not mistaken . " " It 's very late , Larry . We may have a problem , that 's why I 'm calling . " " A problem ? I did n't even know we had any business going . What is it ? " " Your missionary work . " " Our what ? " " Bertholdier . His friends . " " Who ? " " Jacques-Louis Bertholdier . " " Who is he ? I 've heard the name but I ca n't place him . " " You ca n't . . . place him ? " " Sorry . " " I 've been with Joel . I arranged the meeting . " " Joel ? How is he ? Is he in Paris now ? " " You were n't aware of it ? " " Last time I spoke with him was two days ago in Geneva  --  after that awful business with Halliday . He told me he was all right , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me understand you , Larry . Joel is not in Paris on business for Talbot , Brooks and Simon , is that what you 're saying ? " Lawrence Talbot paused before answering . " No , he 's not , " said the senior partner softly . " Did he say he was ? " " Perhaps I just assumed it . " Again Talbot paused . " I do n't think you 'd do that . But I do think you should tell Joel to call me . " " That 's part of the problem , Larry . I do n't know where he is . He said he was taking the five o'clock plane for London , but he did n't . He checked out of the George Cinq quite a bit later under very odd circumstances . " " What do you mean ? " " His hotel registration was altered , changed to another name  --  a name I suggested , incidentally , as he did n't wish to use his own at lunch . Then lie insisted on leaving by way of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm afraid it 's the least of the oddities . They say he assaulted a man . I le may have killed him . " ' Jesus ! " " I do n't believe it , of course , " said Mattilon quickly . " He would n't , he could n't ? "  | " I hope not . " " Certainly you do n't think ? " " I do n't know what to think , " interrupted Talbot . " When he was in Geneva and we talked , I asked him if there was any connection between Halliday 's death and what he was doing . He said there was n't , but he was so remote , so distant ; his voice sounded hollow . " " What he 's doing . . . ? What is he doing ? " " I do n't know . I 'm not even sure I can find out , but I 'll do my damnedest . I tell you , I 'm worried . Something 's happened to him . His voice was like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I do , " said Mattilon quietly . " I heard him , I saw him . I 'm worried too . " Find him , Rene . Do whatever you can . Give me the word and I 'll drop everything and fly over . He 's hurting somewhere , somehow . " " I 'll do what I can . " Mattilon walked out of his study and faced the two men from the police . " His name is Converse , Joel Converse , " he began . " His name is Converse , first name Joel , " said the younger , taller man from the Surete , speaking into the mouthpiece of a pay phone on the Boulevard Raspail , as the rain pounded the booth . " He 's employed by a law firm in New York : Talbot , Brooks and Simon ; the address is on Fifth Avenue . The assumed name , Simon , however , was apparently a convenience , and not related to the firm . " " I do n't understand . " " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his employers . Mattilon reached one of the partners in New York and it was made clear to him . Also both men are concerned , worried ; they wish to be kept informed . If Converse is found , Mattilon insists on immediate access to him as the attorney of record . He may be holding back , but in my judgment he 's genuinely bewildered . In shock , might be more accurate . He knows nothing of consequence . I could tell if he did . " " Nevertheless , he is holding back . The name Simon was used for my benefit so I would not learn the identity of this Converse . Mattilon knows that ; he was there and they are friends and he brought him to Luboque . " " Then lie was manipulated , General . He did not mention you . " " I le might if he 's questioned further . I can not be involved in any way . " " ( ) f course not , " agreed the man from the Surete with quiet emphasis . " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the incident . " " I'nuliumunc . Inspector First Grade Prudhomme. "  | " Is he frank with you ? " " Yes . He thinks I 'm something of a mechanical ex-soldier whose instincts may outdistance his intellect , but he sees that I 'm willing . He talks to me . " " You 'll be kept with him for a while . Should he decide to go back and see Mattilon , let me know immediately . Paris may lose a respected attorney . My name must not surface . " " He would go back to Mattilon only if Converse was found . And if word came to the Surete as to his whereabouts , I 'd reach you instantly . " " There could be another reason , Colonel . One that might provoke a persistent man into reexamining his progress  --  or lack of it  --  in spite of orders to the contrary . " " Orders to the contrary , sir ? " " They will be issued . This Converse is solely our concern now . All we needed was a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him . " " I do n't understand , General . " " News has come from the hospital . Our chauffeur has taken a turn for the better . " " Good news , indeed . " " I wish it were . The sacrifice of a single soldier is abhorrent to any field commander , but the broader tactics must be kept in view , they must be served . Do you agree ? " " Yes , of course . " " Our chauffeur must not recover . The larger strategy , Colonel . " " If he dies , the efforts to find Converse will be intensified . And you 're right , Prudhomme will reexamine everything , including the lawyer , Mattiion . " " Orders to the contrary will be issued . But watch him . " " Yes , sir . " " And now we need your expertise , Colonel . The talents you developed so proficiently while in the service of the Legion before we brought you back to a more civilized life . " " My gratitude is n't shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get inside the Hospital of Saint Jerome with as little notice as possible ? " " With no notice . There are fire escapes on all sides of the building and it 's a dark night , heavy with rain . Even the police stay in doorways . It 's child 's play . " " But man 's work . It has to be done . " " I do n't question such decisions . " " A blockage in the windpipe , a convulsion in the throat . "  | " Pressure applied through cloth , sir . Gradually and with no marks , a patient 's self-induced trauma . . . . But I would be derelict if I did n't repeat what I said , General . There 'll be a search of Paris , then a large-scale manhunt . The killer will be presumed to be a rich American , an inviting target for the Surete . " " There 'll be no search , no manhunt . Not yet . If it is to be , it will come later , and if it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Go into the field , my young friend . The chauffeur , Colonel ; the broader strategy must be served . " " He 's dead , " said the man in the telephone booth , and hung up .  | Erich Leifhelm . . . born March 15 , 1912 , in Munich to Dr. Heinrich Leifhelm and his mistress , Marta Stoessel . Although the stigma of his illegitimacy precluded a normal childhood in the upper-middle-class , morality-conscious Germany of those years , it was the single most important factor in his later preeminence in the National Socialist movement . At birth he was denied the name of Leifhelm ; until 1931 he was known as Erich Stoessel . Joel sat at a table in the open cafe in Copenhagen 's Kastrup Airport , trying to concentrate . It was his second attempt within the past twenty minutes , the first he abandoned when he realized he was absorbing nothing , seeing only black letters forming an unending string of vaguely recognizable words relating to a figure in the outer reaches of his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many interferences , real and imagined . Nor had he been able to read on the two-hour flight from Paris , having opted for economy class , hoping to melt in with the greatir number of people in the larger section of the aircraft . The concept at least was valid ; the seats were so narrow and the plane so fully occupied that dhows and forearms were virtually immobile . The conditions prohibited Ins taking out the report , both for reasons of space and for fear of the proximity to straying eyes .  | Heinrich Leifhelm moved his mistress and their son to the town of Eichstatt , fifty odd miles north of Munich , visiting them now and then , and providing an adequate but not overly comfortable standard of living . The doctor was apparently torn between maintaining a successful practice  --  with no social blemishes  --  in Munich and a disinclination to abandon the stigmatized mother and child . According to close acquaintances of Erich Stoessel-Leifhelm , these early years had a profound effect on him . Although he was too young to grasp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted by the memory of the small household ' s subsistence level falling as the elder Leifhelm ' s ability to contribute lessened with the burden of wartime taxes . Too , his father 's visits served to heighten the fact that he could not be acknowledged as a son and was not entitled to the privileges accorded two half brothers and a half sister , strangers he was never to know and whose home he could not enter . Through the absence of proper lineage , certified by hypocritical documents and more hypocritical church blessings , he felt he was denied what was rightfully his , and so there was instilled in him a furious sense of resentment , competitiveness , and a deep-seated anger at existing social conditions . By his own admission , his first conscious longings were to get as much as he could for himself  --  both materially and in the form of recognition  --  through the strength of his own abilities , and , by doing so , strike out at the status quo which had tried to emasculate him . By his mid-teens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly aware of the woman across the half-deserted cafe ; she was seated alone at a table , looking at him . Their eyes met and she turned away , placing her arm on the low white railing that enclosed the restaurant , studying the thinning , late-night crowds in the terminal , as if waiting for someone . Startled , Joel tried to analyze the look she had given him . Was it recognition ? Did she know him ? Know his face ? Or was it appraisal ? A well-dressed whore cruising the airport in search of a mark , seeking out a lonely businessman far away from home ? She turned her head slowly and looked at him again , now obviously upset that his eyes were still on her . Then abruptly , in two swiftly defined motions , she glanced at her watch , tugged at her wide-brimmed hat , and opened her purse . She took out a Krone note , placed it on the table , got up , and walked rapidly toward the entrance of the cafe . Beyond the open gate she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch that led to the baggage-claim area . Converse watched her in the dull white neon light of the terminal , shaking his head , annoyed at his alarm . With his attache case and leather-bound report , the woman had probably thought Ile H-as some kind of airport official . Who was the mark , then ?  | He was seeing too many shadows , he thought , as he followed the graceful figure nearing the arch . Too many shadows that held no surprises , no alarms . There had been a man on the plane from Paris sitting several rows in front of him . Twice the man had gotten up and gone to the toilet , and each time he came back to his seat he had looked hard at Joel ? studied him , actually . Those looks had been enough to prime his adrenaline . Had he been spotted at the De Gaulle Airport ? Was the man an employee of Jacques-Louis Bertholdier ? . . . As a man in an alley had been ? Do n't think about that ! He had flicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had given himself the command . " I can always tell a good ole Yank ! Never miss ! " That had been the antiquated salutation in Copenhagen , as both Americans waited for their luggage . " Well , I missed once . Some son of a bitch on a plane in Geneva . Sat right next to me . A real guinea in a three-piece suit , that 's what he was ! 1 le spoke English to the stewardess , so I figured he was one of those rich Cuban spicks from Florida , you know what I mean ? " An emissary in salesman 's clothes . One of the diplomats . * Geneva . It had started in Geneva . Too many shadows . No surprises , no alarms . The woman went through the arch and Joel pulled his eyes away , forcing his attention back to the report on Erich Leifhelm . Then a slight , sudden movement caught the corner of his eye ; he looked back at the woman . A man had stepped out of an unseen recess ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swiftly , and parted as abruptly as they had met , the man continuing into the terminal as the woman disappeared . Did the man glance over in his direction ? Converse watched closely ; had that man looked at him ? It was impossible to tell ; his head was turning in all directions , looking at or for something . Then , as if he had found it , the man hurried toward a bank of airline counters . He approached the Japan Air Lines desk , and taking out his wallet , he began speaking to an Oriental clerk . No surprises , no alarms . A harried traveler had asked directions ; the Interferences were more imagined than real . Yet even here his lawyer 's mentality intervened . Interferences were real whether based in reality or not . Oh , Christ ! Leave it alone ! Concentrate ! At the age of seventeen , Erich Stoessel-Leifhelm had cornleted his studies at the Eichstatt II Gymnasium , excelling Oth academically and on the playing field , where he was known ? an aggressive competitor . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock market crash of ' 29 further ag-  | gravating the desperate economy of the Weimar Republic , and few but the most well-connected students went on to universities . Ina move he later described to friends as one of youthful fury , Stoessel-Leifhelm traveled to Munich to confront his father and demand assistance . What he found was a shock , but it turned out to be a profound opportunity , strangely arrived at . The doctor 's staid , placid life was in shambles . His marriage , from the beginning unpleasant and humiliating , had caused him to drink heavily with increasing frequency until the inevitable errors of judgment occurred . He was censured by the medical community ( with a high proportion of Jews therein ) , charged with incompetence and barred from the Karlstor Hospital . His practice was in ruins ; his wife had ordered him out of the house , an order expedited by an old but still powerful fatherin-law , also a doctor and member of the hospital 's board of directors . When Stoessel-Leifhelm found his father , he was living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city picking up pfennigs by dispensing prescriptions ( drugs ) and deutsche marks by performing abortions . In what apparently ( again according to friends from the time ) was a watershed of pent-up emotions , the elder Leifhelm embraced his illegitimate son and told him the story of his tortured life with a disagreeable wife and tyrannical in-laws . It was the classic syndrome of an ambitious man of minimal talents and maximum connections . But withal , the doctor claimed he had never abandoned his beloved mistress and their son . And during this prolonged and undoubtedly drunken confession , he revealed a fact Stoessel-Leifhelm had never known . His father 's wife was Jewish . It was all the teenager had to hear . The disfranchised boy became the father to the ruined man . There was an announcement in Danish over the airport 's loudspeakers and Joel looked at his watch . It came again , now in German . He listened intently for the words ; he could barely distinguish them , but they were there . " Hamburg  --  Koln-Bonn . " It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the capital of West Germany by way of Hamburg The flying time was less than two hours , the layover in Hamburg justified for those executives who wanted to be at their desks by the start of the business day . Converse had checked his suitcase through to Bonn , making a mental note as he did so to replace the heavy black leather bag with a carry-on . He was no expert in such matters , but common sense told him that the delays required by waiting for one 's luggage  --  in the open for anyone to see  --  was no way to travel swiftly or to avoid eyes that might be searching for him . He put Erich Leifhelm 's dossier in his attache case , closed it and spun the brass combination disks . Ile then got up from the  | table , walked out of the cafe and across the terminal toward the Lufthansa gate . Sweat matted his hairline ; the tattoo inside his chest accelerated until it sounded like a hammering fugue for kettledrums . He knew the man sitting next to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he had  --  o idea . The craggy , lined face , the deep ridges that creased the suntanned flesh , the intense blue-gray eyes beneath the thick , wild brows and brown hair streaked with white  --  he knew him , but no name came , no clue to the man 's identity . Joel kept waiting for some sign of recognition directed at him . None came , and involuntarily he found himself looking at the man out of the corner of his eye . The man did not respond ; instead his attention was on a bound sheaf of typewritten pages , the type larger than the print normally associated with legal briefs or even summonses . Perhaps , thought Converse , the man was half blind , wearing contact lenses to conceal his infirmity . But was there something else ? Not an infirmity , but a connection being concealed . Had he seen this man in Paris  --  as he had seen another wearing a light-brown topcoat in a hotel basement corridor ? Had this man beside him also been at L'Etalon Blanc ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warriors ' playroom . . . in a corner perhaps , and inconspicuous because of the numbers ? Or at Bertholdier 's table , his back to Joel , presumably unseen by the American he was now following ? Was he following him at this moment ? wondered Converse , gripping his attache case . He turned his head barely inches and studied his seatmate . Suddenly the man looked up from the bound typewritten pages and Over at Joel . His eyes were noncommittal , expressing neither curiosity nor irritation . " Sorry , " said Converse awkwardly . " Sure , it 's okay . . . why not ? " was the strange , laconic reply , the accent American , the dialect distinctly Texas-Western . The man returned to his pages . " l ) o we know each other ? " asked Joel , unable to back off from the question . Again the man looked up . " Do n't think so , " he said tersely , once more going back to his report , or whatever it was . Converse looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red light illuminating the silver metal of the wing . Absently he tried to calculate the digital degree heading of the aircraft but his pilot 's mind would not function . He did know the man , and the oddly phrased " Why  | not ? " served only to disturb him further . Was it a signal , a warning ? As his words to Jacques-Louis Bertholdier had been a signal , a warning that the general had better contact him , recognize him . The voice of a Lufthansa stewardess interrupted his thoughts . " Herr Dowling , it is a pleasure , indeed , to have you on board . " " Thank you , darlin ' , " said the man , his lined face creasing into a gentle grin . " You find me a little bourbon over ice and I 'll return the compliment . " " Certainly , sir . I 'm sure you 've been told so often you must be tired of hearing it , but your television show is enormously popular in Germany . " Thanks again , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of pretty little fillies runnin ' around that screen . " An actor . A goddamned actor ! thought Joel . No alarms , no surprises . Just intrusions , far more imagined than real . " You 're too modest , Herr Dowling . They 're all so alike , so disagreeable . But you are so kind , so manly . . . so understanding . " " Understandin ' ? Tell you somethin ' . I saw an episode in Cologne last week while on this picture and I did n't understand a word I was sayin ' . " The stewardess laughed . " Bourbon over ice , is that correct , sir ? " " That 's correct , darlin ' . " The woman started down the first-class aisle toward the galley as Converse continued to look at the actor . Haltingly he spoke . " I am sorry . I should have recognized you , of course . " Dowling turned his suntanned head , his eyes roaming Joel 's face , then dropping to the hand-tooled leather attache case . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrass you if I asked you where you knew me from . You do n't look like a Santa Fe groupie . " " A Santa Fe . . . ? Oh , sure , that 's the name of the show . " And it was , reflected Converse . One of those phenomena on television that by the sheer force of extraordinary ratings and network profits had been featured on the covers of Time and Newsweek . He had never seen it . " And , naturally , " continued the actor , " you follow the tribal rites  --  and wrongs  --  the dramatic vicissitudes of the imperious Ratchet family , owners of the biggest spread north of Santa Fe as well as the historic Chimaya Flats , which they stole from the impoverished Indians . " " The who ? What ? " Dowling 's leathery face again laminated itself into a grin . " Only Pa Ratchet , the Indians ' friend , does n't know about the last part , although he 's being blamed by his red brothers . You see , Pa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did their thing . Incident.illy , I trust you catch the verbal associations iii the name Ratchet ; you  | can take your choice . There 's just plain rats , ' or Ratchet as in wretched , ' or Ratchet as in the tool  --  screwing everything in front of it by merely pressing forward . " There was something different about the actor now , thought Joel , bewildered . Was it his words ? No , not the words , his voice . The Western inflections were greatly diminished . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , but you sound different . " " Wal , Ah 'll jes ' be hornswoggled ! " said Dowling , laughing . Then he returned to the unaccented tones he had begun to display . " You 're looking at a renegade teacher of English and college dramatics who said a dozen years ago to hell with old-age tenure , let 's go after a very impractical dream . It led to a lot of funny and not very dignified jobs , but the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , in one of those indefinable jobs like production-coordinator , ' spotted me in a crowd scene ; it embarrassed the hell out of him . Nevertheless , he put my name in for several small parts . A few panned out , and a couple of years later an accident called Santa Fe came along . That 's when my perfectly respectable name of Calvin was changed to Caleb . Fits the image better , ' said a pair of Gucci loafers who never got closer to a horse than a box at Santa Anita . . . . It 's crazy , is n't it ? " " Crazy , " agreed Converse , as the stewardess walked back up the aisle toward them . " Crazy or not , " added Dowling under his breath , " this good old rancher is n't going to offend anyone . They want Pa Ratchet , they 've got him . " " Your bourbon , sir , " said the woman , handing the actor a glass . " Why , thank you , li'l darlin ' ! My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show ! " " You are too kind , sir . " " May I have a Scotch , please , " said Joel . " That 's better , son , " said Dowling , grinning again as the stewardess left . " And now that you know my crime , what do you do for a living ? " " I 'm an attorney . " " At least you 've got something legitimate to read . This screenplay sure as hell is n't . " Although considered by most of Munich 's respectable citizens to be a collection of misfits and thugs , the National Socialist German Workers ' Party , with its headquarters in Munich , was making itself felt throughout Germany . The radical-populist movement was taking hold by basing its inflammatory message on the evil un-German " them . " It blamed the ills of  | the nation on a spectrum of targets ranging from the Bolsheviks to the ingrate Jewish bankers ; from the foreign plunderers who had raped an Aryan land to , finally , all things not " Aryan , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosmopolitan Munich and its Jewish community laughed at the absurdities ; they were not listening . The rest of Germany was ; it was hearing what it wanted to hear . And Erich Stoessel-Leifhelm heard it too . It was his passport to recognition and opportunity . In a matter of weeks , the young man literally whipped his father into shape . In later years he would tell the story with heavy doses of cruel humor . Over the dissolute physician 's hysterical objections , the son removed all alcohol and smoking materials from the premises , never letting his father out of his sight . A harsh regimen of exercise and diet was enforced . With the zeal of a puritanical athletic trainer , StoesselLeifhelm started taking his father out to the countryside for Gewaltmarschen  --  forced marches  --  gradually working up to all-day hikes on the exhausting trails of the Bavarian mountains , continually shouting at the older man to keep moving , to rest only at his son 's commands , to drink water only with permission . So successful was the rehabilitation that the doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments purchased for a much fatter man . Anew wardrobe was called for , but good clothing in Munich in those days was beyond the means of all but the wealthy , and Stoessel-Leifhelm had only the best in mind for his father  --  not out of filial devotion but , as we shall see , for a quite different purpose . Money had to be found , which meant it had to be stolen . He interrogated his father at length about the house the doctor had been forced to leave , learning everything there was to learn . Several weeks later Stoessel-Leifhelm broke into the house on the Luisenstrasse at three o'clock one morning , stripping it of everything of value , including silver , crystal , oil paintings , gold place settings , and the entire contents of a wall safe . Sales to fences were not difficult in Munich of 1930 , and when everything was disposed of , father and son had the equivalent of nearly eight thousand American dollars , virtually a fortune in those times . The restoration continued ; clothes were tailored in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Odeonsplatz , and , finally , cosmetic changes were effected . The doctor 's unkempt hair was trimmed and heightened by coloring into a masculine Nordic blond , and his shabby inchlong beard shaved off , leaving only a small , unbroken , welltrimmed moustache above his upper lip . The transformation was complete ; what remained was the introduction .  | Every night during the long weeks of rehabilitation , Stoessel-Leifhelm had read aloud to his father whatever he could get his hands on from the National Socialists ' headquarters , and there was no lack of material . There were the standard inflammatory pamphlets , pages of ersatz biological theory purportedly proving the genetic superiority of Aryan purity and , conversely , the racial decline resulting from indiscriminate breeding  --  all the usual Nazi diatribes  --  plus generous excerpts from Hitler 's Mein Kampf . The son read incessantly until the doctor could recite by rote the salient outrages of the National Socialists ' message . Throughout it all , the seventeen-year-old kept telling his father that following the party ' s program was the way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenge the years of humiliation and ridicule . As Germany itself had been humiliated by the rest of the world , the Nazi party would be the avenger , the restorer of all things truly German . It was , indeed , the New Order for the Fatherland , and it was waiting for men of stature to recognize the fact . The day came , a day when Stoessel-Leifhelm had learned that two high-ranking party officials would be in Munich . They were the crippled propagandist Joseph Goebbels and the would-be aristocrat Rudolf Hess . The son accompanied the father to the National Socialists ' headquarters where the well-tailored , imposing , obviously rich and Aryan Doktor requested an audience with the two Nazi leaders on an urgent and confidential matter . It was granted , and according to early party historical archives , his first words to Hess and Goebbels were the following . " Gentlemen , I am a physician of impeccable credentials , formerly head surgeon at the Karlstor Hospital and for years I enjoyed one of the most successful practices in Munich . That was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from me . I am back , I am well , and I am at your service . " The Lufthansa plane began its descent into Hamburg , and Joel , feeling the drag , dog-eared the page of Leifhelm 's dossier and reached down for his attache case . Beside him , the actor Caleb Dowling stretched , script hand , then jammed his screenplay into an open flight bag at his feet . " The only thing sillier than this movie , " he said , " is the amount of iiiuney they 're paying me to be in it . " " Are you filming tomorrow ? " asked Converse . " Today , " corrected Dowling , looking at his watch . " It 's an early shoot , ti x ) . Have to be on location by five-thirty  --  dawn over the Rhine , or something equally inspiring . Now , if they 'd just turn the damn thing into travelogue , we 'd all be better off . Nice scenery . "  | " But you were in Copenhagen . " " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . " " Nope . " " Oh . " The actor looked at Joel , the crow's-feet around his generous eyes creasing deeper with his smile . " My wife 's in Copenhagen and I had two days off . This was the last plane I could get . " " Oh ? You 're married ? " Converse immediately regretted the remark ; he was not sure why , but it sounded foolish . " Twenty-six years , young fella . How do you think I was able to go after that impractical dream ? She 's a whiz of a secretary ; when I was teaching , she 'd always be this or that dean 's gal Friday . " " Any children ? " " Ca n't have everything . Nope . " " Why is she in Copenhagen ? I mean , why is n't she staying with you ? on location ? " The grin faded from Dowling 's suntanned face ; the lines were less apparent , yet somehow deeper . " That 's an obvious question , is n't it ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . " " It 's none of my business , of course . Forget I asked it . " " No , that 's okay . I do n't like to talk about it  --  rarely do  --  but friendly seatmates on airplanes are for telling things . You 'll never see them again , so why not slice off a bit and feel better . " The actor tried haltingly to smile ; he failed . " My wife 's name was Oppenfeld . She 's Jewish . Her story 's not much different from a few million others , but for her it 's ... well , it 's hers . She was separated from her parents and her three younger brothers in Auschwitz . She watched them being taken away ? away from her  --  while she screamed , not understanding . She was lucky , they put her in a barracks , a fourteen-year-old sewing uniforms until she showed other endowments that could lead to other work . A couple of days later , hearing the rumors , she got hysterical and broke out , racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ran into a section of the camp they called the Abfall , the garbage , corpses hauled out of the gas chambers And there they were , the bodies of her mother and her father and her three brothers , the sight and the stench so sickening it 's never left her It never will . She wo n't set foot in Germany and I would n't ask her to . " No alarms , just surprises . . . and another Iron Cross for the Erich 1 , eifhelms of the past , retroactively presented . " Christ , I 'm sorry , " murmured Converse . " I did n't mean to ? " " You did n't . I did .... You see , she knows it does n't make sense . "  | " Does n't make sense ? Maybe you did n't hear what you just described . " " I heard , I know , but I did n't finish . When she was sixteen , she was loaded into a truck with five other girls , all on their way to that different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids took their last chance and beat the hell out of a Wehrmacht corporal who was guarding them in the van . Then with his gun they got control of the truck from the driver and escaped . " Dowling stopped , his eyes on Joel . Converse , silent , returned the look , unsure of its meaning , but moved by what he had heard . " That 's a marvelous story , " he said quietly . " It really is . " " And , " continued the actor , " for the next two years they were hidden by a succession of German families , who surely knew what they were doing and what would happen to them if they got caught . There was a pretty frantic search for those girls  --  a lot of threats made , more because of what they could tell than anything else . Still , those Germans kept moving them around , hiding them , until one by one they were taken across the border into occupied France , where things were easier . They were smuggled across by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then added . " As Pa Ratchet would say , Do you get my drift , son ? ' " " I 'd have to say it 's obvious . " " There 's a lot of pain and a lot of hate in her and God knows I understand it . But there should be some gratitude , too . Couple of times clothing was found , and some of those people  --  those German people ? were tortured , a few shot for what they did . I do n't push it , but she could level off with a little gratitude . It might give her a bit more perspective . " The actor snapped on his seat belt . Joel pressed the locks on his attache case , wondering if he should reply . Valerie 's mother had been part of the German underground . His ex-wife would tell him amusing stories her mother had told her about a stern , inhibited French intelligence officer forced to work with a high-spirited , opinionated German girl , a member of the Untergrund . How the more they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nationality , the more they noticed each other . The Frenchman was Val 's father ; she was proud of him , but in some ways prouder of her mother . There had been pain in that woman , too . And hate . But there had been a reason , and it was unequivocal . As there had been for one Joel Converse years later . " I said it before and I mean it , " began Joel slowly , not sure he should say anything at all . " It 's none of my business , but I would n't ever push it , if I were you . "  | " Is this a lawyer talkin ' to ole Pa ? " asked Dowling in his television dialect , his smile false , his eyes far away . " Do I pay a fee ? " " Sorry , I 'll shut up . " Converse adjusted his seat belt and pushed the buckle in place . " No , I 'm sorry . I laid it on you . Say it . Please . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hate . In sidewinder language that 's called prima facie  --  the obvious , the first sighting . . . the real , if you like . Without these , there 'd be no reason for the gratitude , no call for it . So , in a way , the gratitude is just as painful because it never should have been necessary . " The actor once again studied Joel 's face , as he had done before their first exchange of words . " You 're a smart son of a bitch , are n't you ? " " Professionally adequate . But I 've been there . . . that is , I know people who 've been where your wife has been . It starts with the horror . " Dowling looked up at the ceiling light , and when he spoke his words floated in the air , his harsh voice quietly strained . " If we go to the movies , I have to check them out ; if we 're watching television together , I read the TV section . . . sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I tense up , wondering what she 's going to do . She ca n't see a swastika , or hear someone screaming in German , or watch soldiers marching in a goose step ; she ca n't stand it . She runs and throws up and shakes all over ... and I try to hold her . . . and sometimes she thinks I 'm one of them and she screams . After all these years . . . Christ ! " " Have you tried professional help  --  not my kind  --  but the sort she might need ? " " Oh , hell , she recovers pretty quick , " said the actor defensively , as if slipping into a role , his teacher 's grammar displaced for effect . " Also , until a few years ago we did n't have the money for that kind of thing , " he added somberly in his natural voice . " What about now ? That ca n't be a problem now . " Dowling dropped his eyes to the flight bag at his feet . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we were both late bloomers ; we got married in our forties  --  two oddballs looking for something . It 's too late now . " " I 'm sorry . " " I never should have made this goddamn picture . Never . " " Why did you ? " " She said I should . To show people I could play something more than a driveling , south-forty dispenser of fifth-rate bromides . I told her it did n't matter . ... I was in the war , in the Marine Corps . I saw some crap iii the South Pacific but nothing to compare with what she went through , not a spit in the proverbial bucket . Jesus ! Can you imagine what it must have been like ? "  | " Yes , I can . " The actor looked up from the flight bag , a half-drawn smile on his lined , suntanned face . " You , good buddy ? Not unless you were caught in Ko-rea " I was n't in Korea . " " Then you 'd be hard put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was too lucky . " " Well , there was . . . " Converse fell silent ; it was pointless . It had happened so often he did not bother to think about it anymore . ' Nam had been erased from the national conversational psyche . He knew that if he reminded a man like Dowling , a decent man , the air would be filled with apologies , but nothing was served by a jarring remembrance . Not as it pertained to Mrs. Dowling , born Oppenfeld . " There 's the no smoking ' sign , " said Joel . " We 'll be in Hamburg in a couple of minutes . " " I 've taken this flight a half-dozen times over the past two months , " said Caleb Dowling , " and let me tell you , Hamburg 's a bitch . Not German customs , that 's a snap , especially this late . Those rubber stamps fly and they push you through in ten minutes tops . But then you wait . Twice , maybe three times , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . By the way , care to join me for a drink in the lounge ? " The actor suddenly switched to his Southern dialect . " Between you and me , they make it mighty pleasant for of Pa Ratchet . They telex ahead and Ah got me my own gaggle of cowpokes , all ridin ' hard to git me to the waterin ' hole . " " Well . . . ? " Joel felt flattered . Not only did he like Dowling , but being the guest of a celebrity was a pleasant high . He had not had many pleasant things happen to him recently . " I should also warn you , " added the celebrity , " that even at this hour the groupies crawl out of the walls , and the airline PR people manage to roust out the usual newspaper photographers , but none of it takes too long . " Converse was grateful for the warning . " I 've got some phone calls to make , " he said casually , " but if I finish them on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Phone calls ? At this hour ? " " Back to the States . It 's not this hour back in ... Chicago . " " Make them from the lounge ; they keep it open for me . " " It may sound crazy , " said Joel , reaching for words , " but I think better alone . There are some complicated things I have to explain . After customs I 'll find a phone booth . " " Nothing sounds crazy to me , son . I work in Holl-eee-wood . " Sudenly , the actor 's amused exuberance faded . " In the States , " he said  | softly , his words floating again , eyes distant again . " You remember that crap in Skokie , Illinois ? They did a television show on it . . . . I was in the study learning lines when I heard the screams and the sound of a door crashing open . I ran out and saw my wife racing down to the beach . I had to drag her out of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl again , back in that goddamn camp , seeing the lines of hollow-eyed prisoners , knowing which lines were which . . . seeing her mother and father , her three kid brothers . When you think about it , you can understand why those people say over and over , Never again . ' It ca n't ever happen again . I wanted to sell that fucking house ; I wo n't leave her alone in it . " " Is she alone now ? " " Nope , " said Dowling , his smile returning . " That 's the good part . After that night we faced it ; we both knew she could n't be . Got her a sister , that 's what we did . Bubbly little thing with more funny stories about Cuckooburg than ever got into print . But she 's tough as they come ; she 's been bouncing around the studios for forty years . " " An actress ? " " Not so 's anyone could tell , but she 's a great face in the crowd . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " said Joel , as the aircraft 's wheels made bouncing contact with the runway and the jet engines screeched into reverse thrust . The plane rolled forward , then started a left turn toward its dock . Dowling turned to Converse . " If you finish your calls , ask someone for the VIP lounge . Tell them you 're a friend of mine . " " I 'll try to get there . " " If you do n't , " added the actor in his Santa Fe dialect , " see y'awl back in the steel corral . We got us another leg on this here cattle drive , pardner . Glad you 're ridin ' shotgun . " " On a cattle drive ? " " What the hell do I know ? I hate horses . " The plane came to a stop , and the forward door opened in less than thirty seconds as a number of excited passengers rapidly jammed the aisle . It was obvious from the whispers and the stares and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearer views that the reason for the swift exodus of this initial crowd was the presence of Caleb Dowling . And the actor was playing his part , dispensing Pa Ratchet benedictions with warm smiles , broad infectious winks , and deep-throated laughter , all with good ? old-wrangler humility . As Joel watched he felt a rush of compassion for this strange man , this actor , this risk-taker with a private hell he shared with the woman he loved .  | Never again . It ca n't ever happen again . Words . Converse looked down at the attache case he held with both hands on his lap . Inside was another story , one that held a time bomb ready to detonate . I am back , I am well , and I am at your service . Also words from another time  --  but full of menace for the present , for they were part of the story of a living man 's silent return . A spoke in the wheel of Aquitaine . The first rush of curious passengers filed through the exit door after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . He would go through customs as rapidly and as unobtrusively as possible , then find a dark corner of the airport and wait in the deepest shadows until the loudspeakers announced the plane for Cologne-Bonn . Goebbels and Hess accepted Dr. Heinrich Leifhelm 's offer with enthusiasm . One can easily imagine the propaganda expert visualizing the image of this blond Aryan physician of " impeccable credentials " spread across thousands of pamphlets confirming the specious theories of Nazi genetics , as well as his all too willing condemnation of the inferior , avaricious Jew ; he was heaven-sent . Whereas for Rudolf Hess , who wanted more than his little boys to be accepted by the Junkers and the monied class , the Herr Doktor was his answer ; the physician was obviously a true aristocrat , and in time , quite possibly a lover . The confluence of preparation , timing and appearance turned out to be more than young Stoessel-Leifhelm could have imagined . Adolf Hitler returned from Berlin for one of his Marienplatz rallies , and the imposing Doktor , along with his intense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hitler heard everything he wanted to hear , and Heinrich Leifhelm from that day until his death in 1934 was Hitler ' s personal physician . There was nothing that the son could not have , and in short order he had everything he wanted . In June of 1931 a ceremony was held at the National Socialists ' headquarters , where Heinrich Leifhelm ' s marriage to " a Jewess " was proclaimed invalid because of a " concealment of Jewish blood " on the part of an " opportunistic Hebrew family , " and all rights , claims and inheritances of the children of that " insidious union " were deemed void . A civil marriage was performed between Leifhelm and Marta Stoessel , and the true inheritor , the only child who could claim the name of Leifhelm , was an eighteen-year-old called Erich . Munich and the Jewish community still laughed , but not as loudly , at the absurd announcement the Nazis inserted in the  | legal columns of the newspapers . It was considered nonsense ; the Leifhelm name was a discredited name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all outside the law . What they were only beginning to understand was that the laws were changing in changing Germany . In two short years there would be only one law : Nazi determination . Erich Leifhelm had arrived and his ascendancy in the party was swift and assured . At eighteen he was Jungfuhrer of the Hitler Youth movement , photographs of his strong , athletic face and body challenging the children of the New Order to join the national crusade . During his tenancy as a symbol , he was sent to the University of Munich , where he completed his courses of study in three years with high academic honors . By this time , Adolf Hitler had been swept into power ; he controlled the Reichstag , which gave him dictatorial powers . The ThousandYear Reich had begun and Erich Leifhelm was sent to the Officers Training Center in Magdeburg . In 1935 , a year after his father 's death , Erich Leifhelm , now a youthful favorite of Hitler 's inner circle , was promoted to the rank of Oberstleutnant in the Gruppenkommando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vast military expansion that was taking place in Germany , and as the war drew nearer he entered what we can term the third phase of his complicated life , one that ultimately brought him to the centers of Nazi power and at the same time provided him with an extraordinary means of separating himself from the leadership of which he was an intrinsic and influential part . This is briefly covered in the following final pages , a prelude to the fourth phase , which we know is his fanatic allegiance to the theories of George Marcus Delavane . But before we leave the young Erich Leifhelm of Eichstatt , Munich , and Magdeburg , two events should be recorded here that provide insights into the man 's psychotic mentality . Mentioned above was the robbery at the Luisenstrasse house and the resulting profits of the theft . Leifhelm to this day does not deny the incident , taking pleasure in the tale because of the despicable images he paints of his father ' s first wife and her " overbearing " parents . What he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presence , is the original police report in Munich , which , as near as can be determined , was destroyed sometime in August 1934 , a date corresponding to Hindenburg ' s death and Hitler ' s rise to absolute power as both president and chancellor of Germany with the title of der Fiihrer raised to official mandatory status . All copies of the police report were removed from the files , but two elderly pensioners from the Munich department remember it clearly . They are both in their late seventies , have not seen each other in years , and were questioned separately .  | Robbery was the lesser crime that early morning on the Luisenstrasse ; the more serious one was never spoken of at the insistence of the family . The fifteen-year-old Leifhelm daughter was raped and severely beaten , her face and body battered so violently that upon admission to the Karlstor Hospital she was given little chance of recovery . She did recover physically , but remained emotionally disturbed for the rest of her short life . The man who committed the assault had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to know there was a back staircase that led to the girl ' s room , which was separated from the rooms of her two brothers and her mother in the front . Erich Leifhelm had questioned his father in depth regarding the inside design of that house ; he was there by his own admission , and was aware of the fierce pride and strict moral code held by the " tyrannical in-laws . " There is no question ; his compulsion was such that he had to inflict the most degrading insult he could imagine , and he did so , knowing the influential family would and could insist on official silence . The second event took place during the months of January or February 1939 . The specifics are sketchy insofar as there are few survivors of the time who knew the family well , and no official records , but from those who were found and interviewed , certain facts surfaced . Heinrich Leifhelm 's legal wife , his children and her family tried without success for several years to leave Germany . The official party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been acquired in German universities , were owed to the state . Too , there were unresolved legal questions arising from the dissolved union between the late Dr . Heinrich Leifhelm and a member of the family , questions specifically relating to commonly shared assets and the rights of inheritance as they affected an outstanding officer of the Wehrmacht . Erich Leifhelm was taking no chances . His father 's " former " wife and children were virtually held prisoners , their movements restricted ; the house on the Luisenstrasse was watched , and for weeks following any renewed applications for visas , they were all kept under full " political surveillance " on the chance that they had plans of vanishing . This information was revealed by a retired banker who recalled that orders came from the Finanzministerium in Berlin instructing the banks in Munich to immediately report any significant withdrawals by the former Frau Leifhelm and/or her family . During what week or on what day it happened we did not learn , but sometime in January or February of 1936 , Frau Leifhelm , her children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impounded by the Allies on April 23 , 1945 , give a clear , if incomplete , picture of what took place . Obviously driven by his compulsion to validate his  | seizure of the estate in the eyes of the law , Oberstleutnant Erich Leifhelm had a brief filed on his own behalf , listing the articles of grievance suffered by his father , Dr. Heinrich Leifhelm , at the hands of a family cabal , said family of criminals having fled the Reich under indictment . The charges , as expected , were outrageous lies : from outright theft of huge nonexistent bank accounts to character assassination so as to destroy a great doctor 's practice . There was the legal certificate of the " official " divorce , and a copy of the elder Leifhelm 's last will and testament . There was only one true union and one true son , and all rights , privileges and inheritances passed on to him : Oberstleutnant Erich Stoessel-Leifhelm . Because we possessed reasonably accurate dates , survivors were found . It was confirmed that Frau Leifhelm , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles outside of Munich . The Jewish Leifhelms were gone ; the Aryan Leifhelmwas now the sole inheritor of considerable wealth and property that under existing conditions would have been confiscated . Before the age of thirty , he had wiped his personal slate clean and avenged the wrongs he was convinced had been visited on his superior birth and talents . A killer had matured . " You must have one hell of a case there , " said Caleb Dowling , grinning and poking Joel with his elbow . " Your butt burned up in the ashtray a while ago . I reached over to close the goddamned lid , and all you did was raise your hand like I was out of order . " " I 'm sorry . It 's . . . it 's a complicated brief . Christ , I would n't raise my hand to you , you 're a celebrity . " Converse laughed because he knew it was expected . " Well , my second bit of news for you , good buddy , is that celebrity or no , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and you still got a reefer in your fingers . Now , I grant you , you did n't light it , but we 're getting a lot of Nazi looks over here . " " Nazi . . . ? " Joel spoke the word involuntarily as he pressed the unlit cigarette into the receptacle ; he was not aware that he had been holding it . " A figure of speech and a had line , " said the actor . " We 'll be in Cologne before you put all that legal stuff away . Come on , good buddy , lie 's going in for the approach . " " No , " countered Joel without thinking . " I le 's making a pitchout until he gets the tower 's untnuttotts Its standard  --  we 've got at least three minutes "  | " You sound like you know what the hell you 're talking about . " " Vaguely , " said Converse , putting the Leifhelm dossier into his attache case . " I used to be a pilot . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got paid . " " For an airline ? I mean , one of these real airlines ? " " Larger than this one , I think . " " Goddamn , I 'm impressed . I would n't have thought so . Lawyers and pilots somehow do n't seem compatible . " " It was a long time ago . " Joel closed his case and snapped the locks . The plane rolled down the runway , the landing having been so unobtrusive that a smattering of applause erupted from the rear of the aircraft . Dowling spoke as he unfastened his seat belt . " I used to hear some of that after a particularly good class . " " Now you hear a lot more , " said Converse . " For a hell of a lot less . By the way , where are you staying , counselor ? " Joel was not prepared for the question . " Actually , Im not sure , " he replied , again reaching for words , for an answer . " This trip was a lastminute decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell you what , I 'm at the Konigshof and , I suspect I 've got a little influence . Let 's see what we can do . " " Thanks very much , but that wo n't be necessary . " Converse thought rapidly . The last thing he wanted was the attention focused on anyone in the actor 's company . " My firm 's sending someone to meet me and he 'll have the accommodations . As a matter of fact , I 'm supposed to be one of the last people off the plane , so he does n't have to try to find me in the crowd . " " Well , if you 've got any time and you want a couple of laughs with some actor types , call me at the hotel and leave a number . " " I probably will . I enjoyed riding shotgun . " " On a cattle drive , pardner ? " Joel waited . The last stragglers were leaving the plane , nodding at the flanking stewardesses , some yawning , others in awkward combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final passenger exited through the aircraft 's concave door and Converse got up , gripping the handle of his attache case and sliding into the aisle . Instinctively , without having a conscious reason to do so , he glanced to his right , into the rear section of the plane . What he saw  --  and what saw him  --  made him freeze . His breath exploded silently in his chest . Seated in the last row of the long fuselage was  | a woman . The pale skin under the wide brim of the hat , and the frightened , astonished eyes that abruptly looked away  --  all formed an image he vividly remembered . She was the woman in the cafe at the Kastrup Airport in Copenhagen ! When he last saw her she was walking rapidly into the baggage-claim area , away from the row of airlines ' counters . She had been stopped by a man in a hurry ; words had been exchanged  --  and now Joel knew they had concerned him . The woman had doubled back , unnoticed in the last-minute rush for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had followed him from Denmark !  | Converse rushed up the aisle and through the metal door into the carpeted tunnel . Fifty feet down the passageway the narrow walls opened into a waiting area , the plastic seats and the roped-off stanchions designating the gate . There was no one ; the place was empty , the other gates shut clown , the lights off . Beyond , suspended from the ceiling were signs in German , French and English directing passengers to the main terminal and the downstairs baggage claim . There was no time for his luggage ; he had to run , to get away from the airport as fast as possible , get away without being seen . Then the obvious struck him , and he felt sick . He had been seen ; they knew he was on the flight from Hamburg  --  whoever they were . The instant he walked into the terminal he would be spotted , and there was nothing he could do about it . They had found him in Copenhagen ; the woman had found him and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in Hamburg , or switch planes to another destination . /Iowa How did they do it ? There was no time to think about it ; he would think about it later ? if there was a later . He passed the arches of the closed-down metal detectors and the black conveyor belts where hand luggage was X-rayed . Ahead , no more than seventy-five feet were the doors to the terminal . 11 ' hat was he going to do , what should he do ?  | Joel stopped at a door . The sign on it was emphatic , the German forbidding . Yet he had seen those words before . Where ? What was it ? ... Zurich ! He had been in a department store in Zurich when a stomach attack had descended to his bowels . He had pleaded with a sympathetic clerk who had taken him to a nearby employees ' men 's room . In one of those odd moments of gratitude and relief , he had focused on the strange words as they had drawn nearer . Nur fur hier Beschd f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pushed the door open and went inside , not sure what he would do other than collect his thoughts . A man in green overalls was at the far end of the line of sinks against the wall ; he was combing his hair while inspecting a blemish on his face in the mirror . Converse walked to the row of urinals beyond the sinks , his demeanor that of an airlines executive . The affectation was accepted ; the man mumbled something courteously and left . The door swung shut and he was alone . Joel stepped back from the urinal and studied the tiled enclosure , hearing for the first time the sound of several voices . . . outside , somewhere outside , beyond . . . the windows . Three-quarters up from the floor and recessed in the far wall were three frosted-glass windows , the painted white frames melting into the whiteness of the room . He was confused . In these security-conscious days of airline travel with the constant emphasis on guarding against smuggled arms and narcotics , a room inside a gate area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not make sense . Then the obvious fact occurred to him . It could be his way out ! The flight from Hamburg was a domestic flight , this part of the Cologne-Bonn airport a domestic terminal ; there were no customs ! Of course there were exterior windows in an enclosure like this . What differ ence did it make ? Passengers still had to pass through the electronic arches and , conversely , authorities wanting to pick up a passenger flying domesti cally would simply wait by a specific gate . But no one waited for him . He had been the last  --  the second to last ? passenger off the late night flight . The roped-off gate had been de serted ; anyone sitting in one of the plastic chairs or standing beyond the counter would be obvious . Therefore , those who were keeping him in their sights did not want to be seen themselves . Whoever they were , they were waiting , watching for him from some remote spot inside the terminal ' I'licy could wait . 1 Ic approached the far-right window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor When he stcxxl erect , the sill was only inches above his head  | He reached for the two white handles and pushed ; the window slid easily up several inches . He poked his fingers through the space ; there was no screen . Once the window was raised to its full height , there would be enough room for him to crawl outside . There was a clattering behind him , rapid slaps of metal against wood . He spun around as the door opened , revealing a hunched-over old man in a white maintenance uniform carrying a mop and a pail . Slowly , with deliberation , the old man took out a pocket watch , squinted at it , said something in German , and waited for an answer . Not only was Joel aware that he was expected to speak , but he assumed that he had been told the employees ' men 's room was being closed until morning . He had to think ; he could not leave ; the only way out of the airport was through the terminal . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no time to be running around a section of an airport shut down for the remainder of the night . Patrolling guards might compound his problems . His eyes dropped , centering on the metal pail , and in desperation he knew what he had to do , but not whether he could do it . With a sudden grimace of pain , he moaned and grabbed his chest , falling to his knees . His face contorted , he sank to the floor . " Doctor , doctor . . . doctor ! " he shouted over and over again . The old man dropped the mop and the pail ; a guttural stream of panicked phrases accompanied several cautious steps forward . Converse rolled to his right against the wall ; he gasped for breath as he watched the German with wide , blank eyes . " Doctor . . . I " he whispered . The old man trembled and backed away toward the door ; he turned , opened it and ran out , his frail voice raised for help . There would be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to the left , the entrance to the terminal perhaps a hundred to the right . Joel got up quickly , raced to the pail , turned it upside down , and brought it back to the window . He placed it on the floor and stepped up with one foot , his palms making contact with the base of the window ; he shoved . The glass rose about four inches and stopped , the frame lodged against the sash . He pushed again with all the strength he could manage in his awkward position . The window would not budge ; breathing hard he studied it , his intense gaze zeroing in on two small steel objects he wished to God were not in place , but they were . Two protective braces were screwed into the opposing sashes , preventing the window from being opened more than six inches . Cologne-Bonn might not be an internat ional airport with a panoply of sophisticated security devices , but it was not without its own safeguards . There were distant shouts from beyond the door ; the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face as he stepped off the pail and reached for his attache case on the floor . Action and decision were simultaneous , only instinct unconsciously governing both . Joel picked up the leather case , stepped forward and crashed it repeatedly into the window , shattering the glass and finally breaking away the lower wooden frame . He stepped back up on the pail and looked out . Beyond ? below  --  was a cement path bordered by a guardrail , floodlights in the distance , no one in sight . He threw the attache case out the window , and pulled himself up , his left knee kicking fragments of glass and what was left of the frame to the concrete below . Awkwardly , he hunched his whole body , pressing his head into his shoulder blades , and plunged through the opening . As he fell to the ground he heard the shouts from inside : they grew in volume , all in counterpoint , a mixture of bewilderment and anger . He ran . Minutes later , at a sudden curve in the cement path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of taxis waiting for the passengers of Flight 817 from Hamburg to pick up their luggage before the drivers collected their inflated night prices to Bonn and Cologne . There were entrance and exit roads leading to the platform , broken by pedestrian crosswalks , and beyond these an immense parking lot with several lighted booths still operating for those driving their own cars . Converse slipped over the guardrail and ran across an intersecting lawn until he reached the first road , racing into the shadows at the first blinding glare of a floodlight . He had to reach a taxi , a taxi with a driver who spoke English ; he could not remain on foot . . . . He had been captured on foot once , years ago . On a jungle trail , where if he had only been able to commandeer a jeep ? an enemy jeep  --  he might have . . . Stop it ! This is not ' Nam , it 's a goddamn airport with a million tons of concrete poured between flowers , grass and asphalt ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had made a complete semicircle  --  one-eight zero . He was in darkness , the last of the taxis in the line ahead of him . He approached the first , which was the last . " English ? Do you speak English ? " " Englisch ? Nein . " The second cabdriver was equally negative , but the third was not . " As you Americans say , only the asshole would drive a taxi here wizzout the English reasonable . Is so ? " " It 's reasonable , " said Joel , opening the door . " Nein ! You can not do that ! " " I ) o what ? " " Cottle in the taxi . "  | " Why not ? " " The line . Allviss is the line . " Converse reached into his jacket pocket and withdrew a folded layer of deutsche marks . " I 'm generous . Can you understand that ? " " Is also urgent sickness . Get in , mein Herr . " The cab pulled out of the line and sped toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver . " Bonn , " replied Converse , " but not yet . I want you to drive into the other lane and stop across the way in front of that parking lot . " " Las . . . ? " " The other lane . I want to watch the entrance back there . I think there was someone on the Hamburg plane I know . " " Many have come out . Only those with luggage ? " " She 's still inside , " insisted Joel . " Please , just do as I say . " " She ? . . . Ach , ein Fraulein . Ist ja lhr Geld , mein Herr . " The driver swung the cab into a cutoff that led to the incoming road and the parking lot . He stopped in the shadows beyond the second booth ; the terminal doors were on the left , no more than a hundred yards away . Converse watched as weary passengers , carrying assorted suitcases , golf bags , and the ever-present camera equipment , began to file out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for taxis , a few walking across the pedestrian lanes toward the parking lot . Twelve minutes passed and still there was no sign of the woman from Copenhagen . She could not have been carrying luggage , so the delay was deliberate , or instructed . The driver of the cab had assumed the role of nonobserver ; he had turned off the lights and , with a bowed head , appeared to be dozing . Silence . . . . Across the parallel roads , the travelers from Hamburg had dwindled . Several young men , undoubtedly students , two in cut-off jeans , their companions drinking from cans of beer , were laughing as they counted the deutsche marks between them . A yawning businessman in a three-piece suit struggled with a bulging suitcase and an enormous cardboard box wrapped in a floral print , while an elderly couple argued , their dispute emphasized by two shaking heads of gray hair . Five others , men and women , were by the curb at the far end of the platform apparently waiting for prearranged transportation . But where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not alone . Instead , she was flanked by two men , a third directly behind her . All four walked slowly , casually , out of the automatic glass doors , moving to the left , their pace quickening until they reached the dimmest area of the canopied entrance . Then the three men angled themselves in front of the woman , as if mounting a wall of protection , their heads turning , talking to her over their shoulders while  | studying the crowd . Their conversation became animated but controlled , anger joining confusion , tempers held in check . The man on the right broke away and crossed to the corner of the building , then walked beyond into the shadows . He pulled an object out of an inside pocket and Joel instantly knew what it was ; the man raised it to his lips . He was talking by radio to someone in or around the airport . Barely seconds passed when the beams of powerful headlights burst through the glass over Converse 's right shoulder , filling the back of the taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neck arched , his face at the edge of the rear window . Beyond , by the exit booth of the parking lot , a dark-red limousine had stopped , the driver 's arm extended , a bill clutched in his hand . The attendant took the money , turning to make change , when the large car lurched forward leaving the man in the booth bewildered . It careened around the taxi and headed for the curve in the road that led to the airport terminal 's entrance . The timing was too precise ; radio contact had been made and Joel spoke to the driver . " I told you I was generous , " he said , startled by the words he was forming in his head . " I can be very generous if you 'll do as I ask you to . " " I am an honest man , " replied the German , uncertainty in his voice , his eyes looking at Joel in the rearview mirror . " So am I , " said Converse . " But I 'm also honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see the dark-red car over there , the one that 's stopping at the corner of the building ? " Ia . " Do you think you could follow it without being seen ? You 'd have to stay pretty far behind , but keep it in sight . Could you do it ? " " Is not a reasonable request . How generous is the Amerikaner ? " " Two hundred deutsche marks over the fare . " " You are generous , and I am a superior driver . " The German did not underestimate his talents behind the wheel . Skillfully he weaved the cab unobtrusively through a cutoff , swinging abruptly left into the parallel exit road and bypassing the entrance to the terminal . " What are you doing ? " asked Joel , confused . " I want you to follow ? " " Is only way out , " interrupted the driver , glancing back at the airport platform while maintaining moderate speed . " I shall let him pass me . I am just one more insignificant taxi on the autobahn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head away from the windows . " That 's reasonably good thinking , " he said . " Superior , mein Herr . " Again the driver looked briefly back out the window , then concentrated on the road and the rearview mirror . Mo-  | ments later he gradually accelerated his speed ; it was not noticeable ; there was no breaking away , instead merely a faster pace . He eased to the left , passing a Mercedes coupe , staying in the lane to overtake a Volkswagen , then returning to the right . " I hope you know what you 're doing , " muttered Joel . No reply was necessary as the dark-red vehicle streaked by on the left . " Directly ahead the road separates , " said the driver . " One way to Koln , the other to Bonn . You say you are going to Bonn , but what if your friend goes to Koln ? " " Stay with him . " The limousine entered the road for Bonn and Converse lighted a cigarette , his thoughts on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known from the passenger manifest . So be it ; he would have preferred otherwise , but once the initial contact had been made with Bertholdier it was not a vital point . He could operate as himself ; his past might even be an asset . Also , there was a positive side to the immediate situation ; he had learned something  --  several things . Those following him ? who now had lost him  --  were no part of the authorities ; they were not connected with either the German or the French police , or the coordinating Interpol . If they were , they would have taken him at the gate or on the plane itself , and that told him something else . Joel Converse was not wanted for assault or  --  God forbid  --  murder back in Paris . And this assumption could only lead to a third probability : the violent , bloody struggle in the alley was being covered up . Jacques-Louis Bertholdier was taking no chances that because of his severely wounded aide his own name might surface in any connection whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such alarming insinuations to the revered general . The protection of Aquitaine was paramount . There was a fourth possibility , so realistically arrived at it could be considered fact . The men in the dark-red limousine who had met the I Iamburg plane were also part of Aquitaine , underlings of Erich Leifhelm , the spoke of Aquitaine in West Germany . Sometime during the last five hours , Bertholdier had learned the identity of the ersatz Henry Simon ? probably through the management of the George V  --  and contacted I . eifhelm . Then , both alarmed that no passenger manifest listed an American named Converse flying from Paris to Bonn , they had checked the other airlines and found he had gone to Copenhagen . The alarms must have been strident . Why Copenhagen ? He said he was going to Bonn . Why did this strange man with his extraordinary information go to Copenhagen ? Who are his contacts , whom will he meet ? Find him . Find them ! Another phone call had been made , a description given , and a  | woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport . It was all so **25;645;TOOLONG . He had flown to Denmark for one reason , but another purpose had been served . They had found him , but in the finding they had revealed their own panic . An agitated reception committee , the use of a radio at night to reach an unseen vehicle only a few hundred feet away , a racing limousine : these were the ingredients of anxiety . The enemy was offbalance and the lawyer in Converse was satisfied . At this moment that enemy was a quarter of a mile down the road , speeding into Bonn , unaware that a taxi behind them , skillfully maneuvered by a driver slipping around the intermittent traffic , was keeping them in sight . Joel crushed out his cigarette as the driver slowed down to let a pickup truck pass . He could see the large dark-red car ahead on the long curve . The German was no amateur ; he knew the moves to make , and Converse understood . Whoever was in that limousine might well be an influential owner , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a powerful man . Probabilities . . . everything was probabilities . He had built his legal reputation on the study of probabilities , and it was a simpler process than most of his colleagues believed . The approach , that is , was simple , not the work ; that was never easy . It demanded the dual discipline of concentrating on the minute and prodding the imagination to expand until the minutiae were arranged and rearranged into dozens of different equations . This exhaustive what-if process was the keystone of legal thinking ; it was as simple as that . It was also a verbal trap , Joel reflected , as he thought back several years , smiling an uncomfortable smile alone in the darkness . In one of her moments of pique , Val had told him that if he would spend one iota of the time on the two of them that he spent on his " goddamned probabilities , " he would " probably " come to realize that the " probability " of their surviving together was " very probably nil . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor in the pursuit of candor . Her striking looks aside , Valerie Charpentier Converse was a very funny lady . Unable not to , he had smiled at her explosion that night years ago , then they both had laughed quietly until she turned away and left the room , too much sadness in the truth she had spoken . Large picturesque buildings gradually replaced the quiet countryside , reminding Converse of huge Victorian houses with filigreed borders and overhanging eaves and grilled balconies beneath large rectangular windows  --  stark geometric shapes . These in turn gave way to a contradictory st retch of attractive but perfectly ordinary residential homes , the sort that could be found in any traditional wealthy suburb on the outskirts of a  | major American city . Scarsdale , Chevy Chase , Grosse Pointe or Evanston . Then came the center of Bonn where narrow , gaslit streets ran into wider avenues with modern lighting , quaint squares only blocks away from banks of contemporary stores and boutiques . It was an architectural anachronism  --  Old World ambience coexisting with up-to-the-minute structures , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or grandeur . Instead it appeared to be a large town , growing rapidly larger , the town fathers uncertain of its direction . The birthplace of Beethoven and the gateway to the Rhine Valley was the most unlikely capital imaginable of a major government . It was anything but the seat of a hard-nosed Bundestag and a series of astute , sophisticated prime ministers who faced the Russian bear across the borders . " Mein Herr ! " cried the driver . " They take the road to Bad Godesberg . Das Diplomatenviertel . " " What does that mean ? " " Embassies . They have Polizeistreifen ! Patrols . We could be , how do you say , known ? " " Spotted , " explained Joel . " Never mind . Do what you 've been doing , you 're great . Stop , if you have to ; park , if you have to . Then keep going . You now have three hundred deutsche marks over the fare . I want to know where they stop . " It came six minutes later , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imagination had led him , he was not prepared for the driver 's words . " That is the American embassy , mein Herr . " Joel tried to focus his thoughts . " Take me to the Hotel Konigshof , " he said , remembering , not knowing what else to say . " Yes , I believe Herr Dowling left a note to that effect , " said the desk clerk , reaching below the counter . " He did ? " Converse was astonished . He had used the actor 's name in the outside hope of some possible preferential treatment . He expected nothing else , if indeed that . " Here it is . " The clerk extracted two small telephone memos from the thin stack in his hand . " You are John Converse , an American attorney . " " Close enough . That 's me . " " Herr Dowling said you might have difficulty finding appropriate accommodations here in Bonn . Should you come to the Konigshof tonight , he requested that we be as helpful as possible . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular man . " " I le deserves to be , " said Joel .  | " I see he also left a message for you . " The clerk turned and retrieved a sealed envelope from one of the mailboxes behind him . He handed it to Converse , who opened it . Hi , pardner . If you do n't pick this up , I 'll get it back in the morning . Forgive me , but you sounded like too many of my less fortunate colleagues who say no when they want to say yes . Now collectively in their case , it 's some kind of warped pride because they think I 'm suggesting a handout  --  it 's either that or they do n't want to meet someone who may be where I 'm going . By the looks of you , I 'd have to rule out the former and stick with the latter . There 's someone you do n't want to meet here in Bonn , and you do n't have to . The room 's taken care of and in my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue about the bill . I owe you a fee , counselor , and I always pay my debts . At least during the last four years I have . Incidentally , you 'd make a lousy actor . Your pauses are n't at all convincing . Pa Ratchet Joel put the note back in the envelope , resisting the temptation to go to a house phone and call Dowling . The man would have little enough sleep before going to work ; thanks could wait until morning . Or evening . " Mr. Dowling 's arrangements are generous and completely satisfactory , " he said to the clerk behind the counter . " He 's right . If my clients knew I 'd come to Bonn a day early , I 'd have no chance to enjoy your beautiful city . " " Your privacy will be respected , sir . Herr Dowling is a most thoughtful man , as well as generous , of course . Your luggage is outside with a taxi , perhaps ? " " No , that 's why I 'm so late . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be here in the morning . At least that 's what I was told at the airport . " " Ach , so inconvenient , but all too familiar . Is there anything you might require ? " " No , thanks , " replied Converse , raising his attache case slightly . " The bare necessities travel with me . . . . Well , there is one thing . Would it be possible to order a drink ? " " Of course . " Joel sat up in bed , the dossier at his side , the drink in his hand . He needed a few minutes to think before going back into the world of Field Marshal Erich Leifhelm . With the help of the switchboard , he had called the all-night number for Lufthansa and had been assured that his suitcase  | would be held for him at the airport . He gave no explanation other than the fact that he had been traveling for two days and nights and simply did not care to wait for his luggage . The attendant could read into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mind was on other things . The American embassy ! What appalled him was the stark reality of old Beale 's words . . . . Behind it all are those who do the convincing , and they 're growing in numbers everywhere .... We 're in the countdown . . . three to five weeks , that 's all you 've got . . . . It 's real and its coming . Joel was not prepared for the reality . He could accept Delavane and Bertholdier , certainly Leifhelm , but the shock of knowing that ordinary embassy personnel  --  American personnel  --  were on the receiving end of orders from Delavane 's network was paralyzing . How far had Aquitaine progressed ? How widespread were its followers , its influence ? Was tonight the frightening answer to both questions ? He would think about it all in the morning . First , he had to be prepared for the man he had come to find in Bonn . As he reached for the dossier he remembered the sudden deep panic in Avery Fowler 's eyes  --  Preston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much had he known ? It is pointless to recount Erich Leifhelm 's exploits in the early to middle years of the war other than to say his reputation grew , and  --  what is most important  --  he was one of the very few superior officers to come up through Nazi party ranks accepted by the old-line professional generals . Not only did they accept him but they sought him out for their commands . Men like Rundstedt and Von Falkenhausen , Rommel and von Treskow ; at one time or another each asked Berlin for Leifhelm 's services . He was unquestionably a brilliant strategist and a daring officer , but there was something else . These generals were aristocrats , part of the ruling class of prewar Germany , and by and large loathed the National Socialists , , considering them thugs , exhibitionists and amateurs . It is not difficult to imagine Leifhelm , sitting among these men , modestly expounding on what was clearly noted in his military record . He was the son of the late prominent Munich surgeon Dr. Heinrich Leifhelm , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conjecture , however , to understand how much further he went to ingratiate himself , for the following is extracted from an interview with General Rolf Winter , Standortkommandant of the Wehrbereichskommando in the Saar sectors : We would sit around having cof fee after dinner , the talk quite depressing . We knew the war was lost . The insane orders from Berlin  --  most we agreed would never be carried out  - -  guaranteed wholesale slaughter of troops and civilians . It  | was madness , national suicide . And always , this young Leifhelm would say things like " Perhaps the fools will listen to me . They think I 'm one of them , they 've thought so from the early days in Munich . " . . . And we would wonder . Could he bring some sanity to the collapsing front ? He was a fine officer , highly regarded , and the son of a well-known doctor , as he constantly reminded us . After all , young men 's heads were turned in those early days  --  the cavernous soul-stirring roars of Sieg hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching beside ten thousand torches at night . It was all so melodramatic , so Wagnerian . But Leifhelm was different ; he was n't one of the gangsters ; patriotic , of course , but not a hoodlum . . . . So we sent dispatches with him to our closest comrades in Berlin , dispatches that would have resulted in our executions had they fallen into the wrong hands . We were told he tried very hard , but he could not put sanity in the minds of men who lived in daily fear of death from rumor and gossip . But he maintained his own sanity  --  and loyalty-which were constant . We were informed by one of his adjutants  --  not him , mind you  --  that he was confronted by an S . S . colonel who had followed him in the street and demanded the contents of his briefcase . He refused , and when threatened with immediate arrest , he shot the man so as not to betray us . He was one of us . It was a noble risk and only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear what Leifhelm was doing and equally clear that the dispatches were never shown to anyone , nor was there an S.S. colonel shot in the streets during a bombing raid . According to Winter , those dispatches from the Saar were so explosive in content that someone would have remembered them ; no one does . Once again , Leifhelm had seen an opportunity . The war was lost , and the Nazis were about to become the ultimate twentieth-century villains . But not the elite German general corps  --  there was a distinction . He wiped another slate clean and joined the " Prussians . " He was so successful that he was rumored to have been part of the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler at Wolfsschanze , and called upon to be a member of Donitz 's surrender team . During the cold war , Allied Central Command asked him to join other key elements of the Wehrmacht officer corps in the Bundesgrenzschutz . He became a privileged military consultant with full security clearance . A mature killer had survived , and history , with the Kremlin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 49 the Federal Republic was established , and the following September the Allied occupation formally came to an end . As the cold war escalated and West Germany began its remarkable recovery , the NATO forces demanded material and personnel support from their former enemies . The new German  | divisions were formed under the command of ex-Field Marshal Erich Leifhelm . No one had dredged up the questionable decisions of the Munich courts from nearly two decades past ; there were no other survivors and his services were desired by the victors . During the postwar reconstruction when countless settlements and labyrinthine legal resolutions were being sought throughout Germany , he was quietly awarded all assets and property previously decreed , including some of the most valuable real estate in Munich . So ends the third phase of Erich Leifhelm 's story . The fourth phase  --  which concerns us most  --  is the one we know least about . The only certainty is that he has become as deeply entrenched in General De lavane ' s operation as any other man on the primary list . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , the Leifhelm dossier cascading to the floor . He looked at his watch in fear and confusion . It was nearly four o'clock . Who wanted him at this hour ? Had they found him ? Oh , Christ ! The dossier ! The briefcase ! " Joe . . . ? Joe , you up ? " The voice was both a whisper and a shout ? an actor 's sotto voce . " It 's me , Cal Dowling . " Converse ran to the door and opened it , his breath coming in gasps . Dowling was fully dressed , holding up both his hands for silence as he glanced up and down the corridor . Satisfied , he walked rapidly inside , pushing Joel back and closing the door . " I 'm sorry , Cal , " said Converse . " I was asleep . I guess the sound startled me . " " You always sleep in your trousers with the lights on ? " asked the actor quietly . " Keep your voice down . I checked the hallways , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Clear about what ? " " One of the first things we learned on Kwajalein in ' 44 . A patrol does n't mean shit unless you 've got something to report . All it means is that they ere better than you were . " " I was going to call you , to thank you ? " " Cut it , good buddy , " Dowling broke in , his expression serious . " I 'm timing this down to the last couple of minutes , which is about all we 've cit . There 's a limo downstairs waiting to take me out to the cameras over all hour away . I did n't want to come out of my room before in case anyone was hanging around , and I did n't want to call you because a switchboard can he watched or bribed  --  ask anyone in Cuckooburg . I do n't worry about the desk ; they 're not too fond of our crowd over here . " The actor sighed . " When I got to my room , all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visitor . I 'm down the hall and I was hoping to Christ  --  if you came here  --  he would n't see you . " " A visitor ? " " From the embassy . The U.S. embassy . Tell me , Joe ? " " Joel , " interrupted Converse . " Not that it matters . " " Sorry , I 've an obstruction in my left ear and that does n't matter , either . He spent damn near twenty-five minutes with me asking questions about you . He said we were seen talking together on the plane . Now , you tell me , counselor , are you okay , or are my instincts all fucked up ? " Joel returned Dowling 's steady gaze . " Your instincts are perfectly fine , " he said without emphasis . " Did the man from the embassy say other-wise ? " " Not exactly . As a matter of fact , he did n't say a hell of a lot . Just that they wanted to talk to you , wanted to know why you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they knew I was on the plane ? " " Yep , said you 'd flown out of Paris . " " Then they knew I was on that plane . " " That 's what I just said  --  what he said . " " Then why did n't they meet me at the gate and ask me themselves ? " Dowling 's face creased further , his eyes narrowing within the wrinkles of bronzed flesh . " Yeah , why did n't they ? " he asked himself . " Did he say ? " " No , but then , Paris did n't come up until he was about to leave . " " What do you mean ? " " It was like he figured I was holding back something  --  which I certainly was  --  but he could n't be sure . I 'm pretty good at what I do , Joe  --  Joel . " " You also took a risk , " said Converse , remembering that he was talking to a risk-taker . " No , I covered myself . I specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He said there were n't . " " Still , he was ? " " Besides , I did n't like him . He was one of those pushy official types . He kept repeating things , and when he could n't come up with anything , he said , We know he flew out of Paris , ' as if he was challenging me . I said I did n't . " " There 's not much time , but can you tell me what else he asked you ? " " I told you , he wanted to know everything we talked about . I said I did n't have a tape recorder in my head , but it was mainly small talk , the kind of chatter I get all the time from people I meet on planes . About the show , the business . But he did n't want to settle for that ; he kept pushing , which gave me the opportunity to get a little pissed off myself "  | " How so ? " " I said , yes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none of his damn business . He got pretty upset at that , and that let me get even angrier . We exchanged a few barbs but his were n't very sharp ; he was too uptight . Then he asked me for about the tenth time if you 'd said anything about Bonn , especially where you were staying . So I told him for the tenth time the truth  --  at least what you said . That you were a lawyer and here to see clients and I did n't know where the hell you were . I mean I did n't actually know you were here . " " That 's fine . " " Is it ? Instincts are okay for first reactions , counselor , but then , you have to wonder . An aggravating Ivy League government man , waving an embassy ID and acting obnoxious , may be very annoying in the middle of the night , but he is from the Department of State . What the hell 's this all about ? " Joel turned and walked to the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cifhelm dossier on the floor . He turned again and spoke clearly , hearing the exhaustion in his voice . " Something I would n't for the life of me involve you in . But for the record , those instincts of yours were right on , pardner . " " I 'll be honest , " said the actor , his clear eyes amused , peering out from behind the creases . " I thought as much . I said to that bastard if I remembered anything else , I 'd phone Walter what's-his-name  --  except I called him Walt  --  and let him know . " " I do n't understand . " " He 's the ambassador here in Bonn . Can you imagine , with all the troubles they 've got over here , that diplomatic yo-yo had a luncheon for me , a lousy television actor ? Well , the suggestion that I might call the ambassador made our preppie more upset than anything else ; he did n't expect it . He said  --  three times , as I recall  --  that the ambassador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't that important and he had enough on his mind , and actually he was n't even aware of it . And catch this , Mr. Lawyer . He said you were an in-house , State Department query , ' if a simpleminded actor could n't possibly understand bureaucratic jingoism . I think that 's when I said Bullshit . ' " " Thank you , " said Converse , not knowing what else to say , but knowing what he wanted to find out . " That 's also when I figured my instincts were n't so bad . " Dowling ) ked at his watch , then hard at Converse , his eyes now penetrating . " I s a gyrene , but I 'm no flag-waver , good buddy . However , I like the flag . would n't live under any other . " " Neither would I. "  | " Then you make it plain . Are you working for it ? " " Yes , the only way I know how , and that 's all I can tell you . " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you did n't want to be seen with me ? Why you stayed away from me in Hamburg ? and even getting off the plane here ? " " Yes . " " And that son of a bitch did n't want me to call the ambassador . " " No , he did n't . He does n't . He ca n't afford it . And , please , I ask you not to . " " Are you ? Oh , Christ ! Are you one of those undercover people I read about ? I walk into a guy on a plane who ca n't be seen when he gets to an airport . " " It 's not that melodramatic . I 'm a lawyer and simply following up on some alleged irregularities . Please accept that . And I appreciate what yon did for me . I 'm kind of new at this myself . " " You 're cool , good buddy . Man , are you cool . " Dowling turned and walked to the door . He stopped and looked back at Converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At my age it 's allowed , but there 's a streak in you , young fella . Part go-ahead , part stay-where-you-are . I saw it when I talked about my wife . Are you married ? " " I was . " " Who is n't ? Was married , that is . Sorry . " " I 'm not . We 're not . " " Who is ? Sorry , again . My instincts were right . You 're okay . " Dowling reached for the knob . " Cal ? " " Yes ? " " I have to know . It 's terribly important . Who was the man from the embassy ? He must have identified himself . " " He did , " said the actor . " He pushed an ID in front of my face when I opened the door , but I did n't have my glasses on . But when he was leaving I made it clear I wanted to know who the hell he was . " " Who was he ? " " He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait ! " " What ? " " What did you say ? " Converse reeled under the impact of the name . Ile physically had to steady himself , grabbing the nearest solid object , a bedpost , to keep from buckling . " What 's the matter , Joe ? What 's wrong with you ? " " That name ! Is this some kind of joke  --  a bad joke  --  a bad line ! Were you put on that plane ? Did I walk into you ? Are you part of it , Mr. Actor ? You 're damned good at what you do ! " " You 're either juiced or sick . What are you talking about ? " " This room , your note ! Everything ! That name ! Is this whole goddamned night a setup ? " " It 's morning , young man , and if you do n't like this room you can stay wherever you like as far as I 'm concerned . " " Wherever . . . ? " Joel tried to evade the blinding flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the searing blockage in his throat . " No . I came here , " he said hoarsely . " There 's no way you could have known I 'd ( lo that . In Copenhagen , on the plane . . . I got the last ticket in first class ; the seat next to me had been sold , an aisle seat . " ' " That 's where I always sit . On the aisle . " " Oh , Jesus ! "  | " Now you 're rambling . " Dowling glanced at the empty glass on the bedside table , then over at the bureau top where there was a silver tray and a bottle of Scotch whisky provided by an accommodating desk clerk . " How much sauce have you had ? " Converse shook his head . " I 'm not drunk . . . . I 'm sorry . Christ , I 'm sorry ! You had nothing to do with it . They 're using you  --  trying to use you to find me ! You saved my ... my job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And you do n't look like someone who 's that worried about a job , " said the actor , his scowl more one of concern than anger . " It 's not the employment , it 's . . . pulling it off . " Joel silently took a deep breath to control himself , postponing the moment when he would have to confront the awesome implications of what he had just heard . Avery Fowler ! " I want to succeed in what I 'm doing ; I want to win , " he added limply , hoping to conceal the slip he saw Dowling had spotted . " All lawyers want to win . " " Sure . " " I am sorry , Cal . " " Forget it , " said the actor , his voice casual , his look not casual at all . " Where I 'm at these days screeching 's an hourly occurrence  --  only , they do n't say anything . I think you just did . " " No , I overreacted , that 's all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , just this . . . not talking directly , I guess says it . " " Does it ? " " Yes . Please believe that . " " All right , if you want me to . " Dowling again looked at his watch . " I 've got to go , but there 's something else that might be helpful in saving that " ? the actor paused convincingly ? " job of yours . " " What is it ? " asked Converse tightly , trying not to leap at the question . " As this Fowler was leaving I had a couple of thoughts . One was that I 'd been pretty hard on a fellow who was simply doing his job , and the other was just plain selfish . I had n't cooperated , and that could come back and snap me in the ass . Of course if you never showed up here , I 'd get my note back and it would n't matter . But if you did , and you wore a black hat , my tail could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been your first concern , " said Joel truthfully . " Maybe it was , I do n't know . At any rate , I told him that in the course of our conversation I asked you for drinks , to come out on location if you wanted to . He seemed puzzled at the last part , but he understood the first . I asked whether I should call him at the embassy if you took me up on either invitation , and he said no , I should n't do that . "  | " What ? " " In short words , he made it very plain that my calling him would only louse up this ' in-house query . ' He told me to wait for his call . He 'd phone me around noon . " " But you 're filming . You 're on location . " " That 's the beauty part , but the hell with it . There are mobile telephone hookups ; the studios insist on them these days . It 's another kind of screeching called budgetary controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing me . " " Then find me . When he calls me , I 'll call you . Should I tell him you reached me ? " Surprised , Converse stared at the aging actor , the risk-taker . " You 're way ahead of me , are n't you ? " " You 're pretty obvious . So was he , when I put it together  --  which I just did . This Fowler wants to reach you , but he wants to do it solo , away from those people you do n't want to meet . You see , when he was at the door and we had our last words , I was bothered by something . He could n't sustain the role  --  any more than you did on the plane  --  but I could n't be certain . He kind of fell apart on his exit , and that you never do even if you 've got to hold in a sudden attack of diarrhea . . . . What do I tell him , Joe ? " " Get his telephone number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . You look like a coked-up starlet who 's just been told she 's going to play Medea . " " I'li try . " Dowling reached into his pocket and took out a scrap of paper . " Here , " he said approaching Converse and handing it to him . " I was n't sure I was going to give this to you , but I damn well want you to have it now . It 's the mobile number where you can reach me . Call me after you 've talked to this Fowler . I 'm going to be a nervous wreck until I hear from you . " " I give you my word . . . . Cal , what did you mean when you mentioned ' the beauty part ' and forgetting about it ? " The actor 's head shifted back in perfect precision , at just the right angle for anyone in the audience . " The son of a bitch asked me what I did for a living . . . . As they say in the Polo Lounge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed , his head pounding , his body tense . Avery Fowler ! Jesus ! Avery Preston Fowler Halliday ! Press Fowler . . . Press Halliday ! The names bombarded him , piercing his temples and bouncing off the walls of his mind , screaming echoes everywhere . He could not control the assault ; iic began to sway back and forth , his arms  | supporting him , a strange rhythm emerging , the beat accompanying the name  --  names  --  of the man who had died in his arms in Geneva . A man he had known as a boy , the adult a stranger who had manipulated him into the world of George Marcus Delavane and a spreading disease called Aquitaine . This Fowler wants to reach you , but he wants to do it solo , away from those people you do n't want to meet . . . . The judgment of a risk-taker . Converse stopped rocking , his eyes on the Leifhelm dossier on the floor . He had assumed the worst because it was beyond his comprehension , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances even a probability . The geometries were there ; he could not trace them but they were there ! The name Avery Fowler meant nothing to anyone but him  --  at least not in Bonn , not as it pertained to a murder in Geneva . Was Dowling right ? Joel had asked the actor to get the man 's telephone number , but without conviction . The image of a dark-red limousine driving through the embassy 's gates would not leave him . That was the connection that had enveloped the shock of Avery Fowler 's name . The man using it was from the embassy , and at least part of the embassy was part of Aquitaine , therefore the impostor was part of the trap . That was the logic ; it was simple arithmetic . . . but it was not geometry . Suppose there was a break in the line , an insertion from another plane that voided the arithmetic progression ? If there was , it was in the form of an explanation he could not possibly perceive unless it was given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his equilibrium again . As he had done so many times in courtrooms and boardrooms , he began to accept the totally unexpected , knowing he could do nothing about it until something else happened , something over which he had no control . The most difficult part of the process was forcing himself to function until it did happen , whatever it was . Conjecture was futile ; all the probabilities were beyond his understanding . He reached down for the Leifhelm dossier . Erich Leifhelm 's years with the Bundesgrenzschutz were unique and require a word about the organization itself . In the aftermath of all wars , a subjugated national police force is required in an occupied country for reasons ranging from the simple language problem to the occupying power 's need to understand local customs and traditions . There must be a buffer between the occupation troops and a vanquished people so as to maintain order . There is also a side issue rarely elaborated upon or analyzed in the history books , but no less important for that lack . Defeated armies can still possess talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation of defeat can ferment , at minimum distilling itself into hostilities that are counterproductive to a stabilized political climate , or , at maximum , turning into internal subversion that can lead to violence and bloodshed at the expense of the victors and whatever new government that is being formed . To put it bluntly , the Allied General Staff recognized that it had on its hands another brilliant and popular military man who would not suffer the anonymity of early retirement or a corporate boardroom . The Bundesgrenzschutz  --  literally , federal border police  --  like all police organizations , was and is a paramilitary force , and as such the logical repository for men like Erich Leifhelm . They were the leaders ; better to use them than be abused by them . And as always among leaders , there are those few who surge forward , leading the pack . During these years foremost among those few was Erich Leifhelm . His early work with the Grenzschutz was that of a military consultant during the massive German demobilization , then afterward the chief liaison between the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duties were mainly concentrated in the trouble spots of Vienna and Berlin where he was in constant touch with the commanders of the American , British and French sectors . His zealous antiSoviet feelings were rapidly made known by Leifhelm throughout the command centers and duly noted by the senior officers . More and more he was taken into their confidence until  --  as it had happened before with the Prussians  --  he was literally considered one of them . It was in Berlin where Leifhelm first came in contact with General Jacques-Louis Bertholdier . A strong friendship developed , but it was not an association either one cared to parade because of the age-old animosities between the German and French militaries . We were able to trace only three former officers from Bertholdier 's command post who remembered  --  or would speak of  --  seeing the two men frequently at dinner together in out-of-the-way restaurants and cafes , deep in conversation , obviously comfortable with each other . Yet during t hose occasions when Leifhelmwas summoned to French headquarters in Berlin , the formalities were icily proper , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks and titles . In recent years , as noted above , both men have denied knowing each other personally , albeit admitting their paths may have crossed . Where previously acknowledgment of their friendship was discouraged because of traditional prejudices , the current reasons are far more understandable . Both are spearheads in e Delavane organization . The names on the primary list are ire with good reason . They are influential men who sit on the  | boards of multinational corporations that deal in products and technology ranging from the building of dams to the construction of nuclear plants ; in between are a hundred likely subsidiaries throughout Europe and Africa which could easily expedite sales of armaments . As detailed in the following pages , it can be assumed that Leifhelm and Bertholdier communicate through a woman named Ilse Fishbein in Bonn . Fishbein is her married name , the marriage itself questionable in terms of motive insofar as it was dissolved years ago when Yakov Fishbein , a survivor of the camps , emigrated to Israel . Frau Fishbein , born in 1942 , is the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dossier and reached for a memo pad next to the telephone on the bedside table . He then unclipped from his shirt pocket the gold Cartier ball-point pen Val had given him years ago and wrote down the name Ilse Fishbein . He studied both the pen and the name . The Cartier status symbol was a remembrance of better days  --  no , not really better , but at least more complete . Valerie , at his insistence , had finally quit the New York advertising agency , with its insane hours , and gone free-lance . On her last day of formal work , she had walked across town to Cartier and spent a considerable portion of her last paycheck fog his gift . When he asked her what he had done outside of his meteoric rise in Talbot , Brooks and Simon to deserve a gift of such impractical opn lence , she had replied : " For making me do what I should have done a long ; time ago . On the other hand , if free-lancing does n't pay off , I 'll steal I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell , you 'll probably lose it . " Free-lancing had paid off very well , indeed , and he had never lost the pen . Ilse Fishbein gave rise to another kind of thought . As much as he would like to confront her , it was out of the question . Whatever Erich Leifheli knew had been provided by Bertholdier in Paris and relayed by Frail Fishbein here in Bonn . And the communication obviously contained : 1 detailed description as well as a warning ; the American was dangerous . Ilsc Fishbein , as a trusted confidante in Aquitaine , could undoubtedly lead him to others in Germany who were part of Delavane 's network , but t approach her was to ask for his own . . . whatever it was they intended for him at the moment , and he was not ready for that . Still , it was a name , a piece of information , a fact he was not expected to have , and experience had taught him to keep such details up front and reveal them , spring thel II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself when no one was looking . He was a lawyer , and the ways of adversary law were labyrin thine ; whatever was withheld was no-man's-land . On either side ; to the more patient , the stxfils.  | Yet the temptation was so damned inviting . The bloodline of Hermann Goring involved with the contemplated resurrection of the generals ! In Germany . use Fishbein could be an immediate means of unlocking a floodgate of unwanted memories . He held in his hand a spiked club ; the moment would come when he would swing it . Leifhelm ' s commanding duties in the field with the West German NATO divisions lasted seventeen years , whereupon he was elevated to SHAPE headquarters , near Brussels , as military spokesman for Bonn 's interests . Again his tenure was marked by extreme anti-Soviet postures , frequently at odds with his own government 's pragmatic approach to coexistence with the Kremlin , and throughout his final months at SHAPE he was more often appreciated by the Anglo-American right-wing factions than by the political leadership in Bonn . It was only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy in the early eighties had been taken out of the hands of professionals and usurped by be l* icose ideologues that he ordered Leifhelm home and created an innocuous post for the soldier to keep him at bay . Leifhelm , however , had never been a gullible fool , nor was he one now in his new , improvised status . He understood why the politicians had created it  --  it showed recognition of his own J subtle strengths . People everywhere were looking to the past , to men who spoke clearly , with candor , and did not obfuscate the problems facing their countries and the world , especially the Western world . So he began to speak . At first to veterans ' groups and splinter organizations where military pasts and long-established partisan politics guaranteed him a favorable reception . Spurred by the enthusiastic responses he evoked , Leifhelm began to expand , seeking larger audiences , his positions becoming more strident , his statements more provocative . One man listened and was furious . The chancellor learned that Leifhelmhad carried his quasi-politicking into the Bundestag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , but by the sheer force of his personality swaying members who should not have been swayed . Leifhelm 's message came back to the chancellor : an enlarged army in far greater numbers than the NATO commitments ; an intelligence service patterned after the once extraordinary Abwehr ; a general revamping of textbooks , deleting injurious and slanderous materials ; rehabilitation camps for political troublemakers and subversives pretending to be " liberal thinkers . " It was all there . The chancellor had had enough . He summoned Leifhelm to his office , where he demanded his resignation in the presence of three witnesses . Further , he ordered Leifhelm to remove him-  | self from all aspects of German politics , to accept no further speaking engagements , and to lend neither his name nor his presence to any cause whatsoever . He was to retire totally from public life . We have reached one of those witnesses whose name is not pertinent to this report . The following is his recollec-tion : The chancellor was furious . He said to Leifhelm : " Herr General , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive me , a final solution . Number one , you may do as I say . Or you can be stripped of your rank and all pensions and financial accruals afforded therein , as well as the income from some rather valuable real estate in Munich , which in the opinion of any enlightened court would be taken from you instantly . That is your second choice . " I tell you , the field marshal was apoplectic ! He demanded his rights , as he called them , and the chancellor shouted , " You 've had your rights , and they were wrong ! They 're still wrong ! " Then Leifhelm asked what the final solution was , and I swear to you , as crazy as it sounds , the chancellor opened zt drawer of his desk , took out a pistol , and aimed it at Leifhelm . " I , myself , will kill you right now , " he said . " You will not , I repeat , not take us back . " I thought for a moment that the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did n't . He stood there staring at the chancellor , such hatred in his eyes , matched by the statesman 's cold appraisal . Then Leifhelm did a stupid thing . He shot his arm forward  --  not at the chancellor , but away from him  --  and cried " Heil Hitler . " Then he turned in military fashion and walked out the door . We were all silent fora moment or two , until the chancellor broke the silence . " I should have killed him , " he said . " I may regret it . We may all regret it . " Five days after this confrontation , Jacques-Louis Berthol dier made the first of his two trips to Bonn following his re tirement . On his initial visit he stayed at the Schlosspark Hotel , and as hotel records are kept for a period of threo years , we were able to obtain copies of his billing charges . There were numerous calls to various firms doing business with Juneau et Cie , too numerous to examine individually , but one number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections with Bertholdier or his company . It was use Fishbein . However , upon checking Erich Leifhelm 's telephone bills for the dates in question , it was found that he , too , had placed calls to Ilse Fishbein , identical in number with those placed by Bertholdier . Inquiries and brief surveillance further established that Frau Fishbein and Leifhelm have known each other for a number of years . The conclusion is apparent t she is the conduit between Paris and Bonn in Delavane 's apparatus .  | Converse lit a cigarette . There was the name again , the temptation again . use Fishbein could be the shortcut . Threatened with exposure , this daughter of Hermann Goring could reveal a great deal . She could confirm that she was not only the liaison between Leifhelm and Bertholdier but conceivably much more , for the two ex-generals had to transmit information to each other . The names of companies , of buried subsidiaries , and of firms doing business related to Delavane in Palo Alto might surface , names he could pursue legally , looking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a way to make his presence felt but not seen . An intermediary . He had used intermediaries in the past , often enough to know the value of the procedure . It was relatively simple . He would approach a third party to make contact with an adversary carrying information that could be of value to him insofar as it might be deemed damaging to his interests , and if the facts presented were strong enough , an equitable solution was usually forthcoming . The ethics was questionable , but contrary to accepted belief , ethics was in three dimensions , if not four . The end did not justify the means , but justifiable means that brought about a fair and necessary conclusion were not to be dismissed . And nothing could be fairer or more necessary than the dismantling of Aquitaine . Old Beale was right that night on the moonlit beach on Mykonos . His client was not an unknown man in San Francisco but Instead a large part of this so-called civilized world . Aquitaine had to be stopped , aborted . An intermediary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . He picked up the dossier , his eyes heavy . Leifhelmhas few intimate friends that appear to be constant , probably because of his awareness that he is under watch by the ! government . He sits on the boards of several prominent corpoations , which have stated frankly that his name justifies his tipend . . . . Joel 's head fell forward . He snapped it back , widened his eyes , and scanned the final pages rapidly , absorbing only the general impressions ; his concentration was waning . There was mention of several restaurants , the names meaningless ; a marriage during the war that ended when I.ciflielm 's wife disappeared in November of ' 43 , presumed killed in a IBcrlin bombing raid ; no subsequent wife or wives . His private life was extraordinarily private , if not austere ; the exception here was his proclivity h n small dinner parties , the guest lists always varied , again names , again  | meaningless . The address of his residence on the outskirts of Bad Godesberg .... Suddenly Converse 's neck stiffened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote countryside , on the Rhine River and far from any shopping areas or suburban concentration . The grounds are fenced and guarded by attack dogs who bark viciously at all approaching vehicles except Leifhelm 's darkred Mercedes limousine . A dark-red Mercedes ! It was Leifhelm himself who had been at the airport ! Leifhelm who had driven directly to the embassy ! How could it happen ? How ? It was too much to absorb , too far beyond his understanding . The darkness was closing in , Joel 's brain telling him it could no longer accept further input ; it simply could not function . The dossier fell to his side ; he closed his eyes and slept . He was plunging headlong down through a cavernous hole in the earth , jagged black rocks on all sides , infinite darkness below . The walls of irregular stone kept screaming in frenzy , screeching at him like descending layers of misshapen gargoyles with sharp beaks and raised claws lunging at his flesh . The hysterical clamor was unbearable . Where had the silence gone ? Why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open ; his forehead was drenched with sweat , his breath coming in gasps . The telephone by his head was ringing , the erratic bell jarringly dissonant . He tried to shake the sleep and the fear from his semiconsciousness ; he reached for the blaring instrument , glancing at his watch as he did so . It was twelve-fifteen , a quarter past noon , the sun streaking through the hotel window . Blinding . " Yes ? Hello . . . ? " " Joe ? Joel ? " " Yes . " " It 's Cal Dowling . Our boy called . " " What ? Who ? " " This Fowler . Avery Fowler . " " Oh , Jesus ! " It was coming back , it was all coming back . He was seated at a table in the Chat Botte on the Quai du Mont Blanc , flashes of sunlight bouncing off the grillwork on the lakeside boulevard . No ... he was not in Geneva . He was in a hotel room in Bonn , and only hours ago he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he choked , catching his breath . " Did you get a telephone number ? "  | " He said there was n't time for games , and besides , he does n't have one . You 're to meet him at the east wall of the Alter Zoll as fast as you can get there . Just walk around ; he 'll find you . " " That 's not good enough ! " cried Converse . " Not after Paris ! Not after the airport last night ! I 'm not stupid ! " " I did n't get the impression he thought you were , " replied the actor . " He told me to tell you something ; he thought it might convince you . " " What is it ? " " I hope I get this right ; I do n't even like saying it . . . . He said to tell you a judge named Anstett was killed last night in New York . He thinks you 're being cut loose . "  | The Alter Zoll , the ancient tower that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rhine  --  razed to the ground three centuries ago ? was now a tollhouse standing on a green lawn dotted with antique cannons , relics of a might that had slipped away through the squabblings of emperors and kings , priests and princes . A winding mosaic wall of red and gray stone overlooked the massive river below where boats of various descriptions plowed furrows in the open water , caressing the shorelines on both sides , diligent and somber in their appointed rounds ; no Lake Ccneva here , far less the blue-green waters of the mischievous Como . Yet in the distance was a sight envied by people the world over : the Siebengebirge , the seven mountains of Westerwald , magnificent in their intrusions on the skyline . Joel stood by the low wall , trying to focus on the view , hoping it would calm him , but the exercise was futile . The beauty before him was lost , it would not distract him from his thoughts ; nothing could . . . .

How in the space of eighteen hours or less could he have been found ? Found and killed ! " Converse ? "  | Joel turned , whipping his head over his shoulder , his body rigid . Standing twenty feet away on the far edge of a graveled path was a sandy-haired man several years younger than Converse , in his early to mid thirties ; his was a boyish face that would grow old slowly and remain young long after its time . He was also shorter than Joel , but not by much  --  perhaps five ten or eleven  --  and dressed in light-gray trousers and a cord jacket , his white shirt open at the neck . " Who are you ? " asked Converse hoarsely . A couple strolled between them on the path as the younger man jerked his head to his left , gesturing for Joel to follow him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the huge iron wheel of a bronze cannon . " All right , who are you ? " repeated Joel . " My sister 's name is Meagen , " said the sandy-haired man . " And so neither one of us makes a mistake , you tell me who I am . " " How the hell . . . ? " Converse stopped , the words coming back to him , words whispered by a dying man in Geneva . Oh , Christ ! Meg , the kids ... " ' Meg , the kids , ' " he said out loud . " Fowler called his wife Meg . " " Short for Meagen , and she was Halliday 's wife  --  only , you knew him as Fowler . " " You 're Avery 's brother-in-law . " " Press 's brother-in-law , " corrected the man , extending his hand . " Connal Fitzpatrick , " he added . " Then we 're on the same side . " " I hope so . " " I 've got a lot of questions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got for you , Converse . " " Are we going to start off belligerently ? " asked Joel , noting the harsh use of his own last name and releasing Fitzpatrick 's hand . The younger man blinked , then reddened , embarrassed . " Sorry , " he said . " I 'm one angry brother  --  on both sides  --  and I have n't had much sleep . I 'm still on San Diego time . " " San Diego ? Not San Francisco ? " " Navy . I 'm a lawyer stationed at the naval base there . " " Whew , " whistled Converse softly . " It 's a small world . " " I know all about the geography , " agreed Fitzpatrick . " And also you , Lieutenant . How do you think Press got his information ? Of course , I was n't in San Diego then , but I had friends . " " Nothing 's sacred , then . " " You 're wrong ; everything is . I had to pull some very thick strings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago when Press came to me and we made our . . . I guess you 'd call it the contract between us . " " Clarification , please . "  | The naval officer placed a hand on the barrel of the cannon . " Press Halliday was n't just my brother-in-law , he came to be my best friend , closer than any blood brother , I think . " " And you with the militaristic hordes ? " asked Joel , only half joking , a point of information on the line . Fitzpatrick smiled awkwardly , boyishly . " That 's part of it , actually . He stood by me when I wanted to go for it . The services need lawyers too , but the law schools do n't tell you much about that . It 's not where they 're going to get any endowments from .

" I loved him , Converse . Just as I love my sister . That 's why I 'm here . That 's the contract .

" Press came to me and said he was into something pretty heavy and he could n't let it go . He 'd come across information that tied a number of well-known men  --  or once well-known men ? together in an organization that could do a lot of harm to a lot of people in a lot of countries . He was going to stop it , stop them , but he had to go outside the usual courtroom ballparks to do it  --  do it legally . " I asked the normal questions : Was he involved , culpable , that sort of thing , and he said no , not in any indictable sense , but he could n't be sure whether or not he was entirely safe . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his information to the authorities and let them handle it . " " Which is exactly what I told him , " interrupted Converse . Fitzpatrick stopped walking and turned to Joel . " He said it was more complicated than that . " " He was right . " " I find that hard to believe . " " He 's dead . Believe it . " " That 's no answer ! " " You did n't ask a question , " said Converse . " Let 's walk . Go on . Your contract . " Bewilderment on his face , the naval officer began . " It was very simple , " he continued . " He told me he would keep me up to date whenever he traveled , letting me know if he was seeing anyone related to his major concern  --  that 's what we called it , his major concern . ' Also anything else that could be helpful if . . . if . . . goddamn it , if ! " " If what ? " Fitzpatrick stopped again , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Converse let the emotion of the moment pass . " And he told you he was going to Geneva to see me . The man who knew Avery Preston Fowler f lalliday as Avery Fowler roughly twenty-odd years ago in school . " " Yes . We 'd been over that before when I got him the security material on you . He said the time was right , the circumstances right . By the way , he thought you were the best . " Connal permitted himself a brief uncomfortable smile . " Almost as good as he was . " " I was n't , " said Joel , a half-smile returned . " I 'm still trying to figure out his position on some Class B stock in the merger . "  | " What ? " " Nothing . What about Lucas Anstett ? I want to hear about that . " " It 's in two parts . Press said they 'd worked through the judge to spring you if you 'd agree to take on the ? " " They ? Who 's they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me . " " Goddamn it ! Sorry , go ahead . " " That Anstett had talked to your firm 's senior partners and they said okay if you said okay . That 's part one . Part two is a personal idiosyncrasy ; I 'm a news freak , and like most of my ilk , I 'm tuned into the hourly AFR . " " Clarification . " " Armed Forces Radio . Oddly enough , it 's probably got the best news coverage on the air ; it pools all the networks . I have one of those small transistorized jobs with a couple of shortwave bands I pack when I 'm traveling . " " I used to do that , " said Converse . " For the BBC , mainly because I do n't speak French  --  or anything else for that matter . " " They 've got good coverage , but they shift bands too much . Anyway , I had AFR on early this morning and heard the story , such as it was . " " What was it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park South was broken into around two in the morning , New York time . There were signs of a struggle and he was shot in the head . " " That 's it ? " " Not quite . According to a housekeeper , nothing was taken , so robbery was ruled out . That 's it . " " Jesus . I 'll call Larry Talbot . He may have more information . There was n't anything else ? " " Only a quick sketch of a brilliant jurist . The point is , nothing was taken . " " I understand that , " broke in Joel . " I 'll talk to Talbot . " They started walking again , south along the wall . " Last night , " continued Converse , " why did you tell Dowling you were an embassy man ? You must have been at the airport . " " I 'd been at that airport for seven hours going from counter to counter asking for passenger information , trying to find out what plane you were On . " You knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beale thought you were . " " Beale ? asked Joel , startled . " Mykonos ? "  | " Press gave me his name and the number but said I was n't to use either unless the worst happened . " Fitzpatrick paused . " The worst happened , " Ile added . " What did Beale tell you ? " " That you went to Paris , and as he understood it , you were going to Bonn next . " " What else ? " " Nothing . He said he accepted my credentials , as he called them , because I had his name and knew how to reach him ; only Press could have given me that information . But anything else I 'd have to learn from you , if you felt there was something to tell me . He was pretty damned cold . " " He had no choice . " " Although he did say that in case I could n't find you , he wanted to see inc on Mykonos before I began raising my voice . . . for everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he put it . I was going to give you two more days to get here , if I could hold up . " " Then what ? Mykonos ? " " I 'm not sure . I figured I 'd call Beale again , but he 'd have to tell me a lot more than he did to convince me . " " And if he did n't ? Or could n't ? " " Then I 'd have flown straight to Washington and gone to whomever the top floor of the Navy Department suggested . If you think for one goddamned minute I 'm going to let this thing pass for what it is n't , you 're wrong and so is Beale . " " If you 'd have made that clear to him , he would have come up with something . You 'd have gone to Mykonos . " Converse reached into his shirt pocket for his cigarettes ; he offered one to Fitzpatrick , who shook his head . " Avery did n't smoke either , " said Joel aimlessly as he snapped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He inhaled . " It 's okay ; that name 's how I got you to see me . " " Let 's go back to that a minute . There 's a slight inconsistency in your testimony , counselor . Let 's clear it up  --  just so neither one of us makes a mistake . " " I do n't know what you think you 're crowding in on , but go ahead . " " You said you were going to give me two more days to get here , is that right ? " " Yes , if I could make arrangements , get some sleep and hold up . " " How did you know I did n't get here two days before you did ? " Fitzpatrick glanced at Joel . " I 've been a legal officer in the Navy for t Ile past eight years , both as defense counsel and as judge advocate in any number of situations  --  not always courts-martial . They 've taken me to  | most of the countries where Washington has reciprocal legal agreements . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy . " " You were , but I was n't going to use it if I did n't have to , and I did n't . I flew into Dusseldorf , showed my naval papers to the Inspektor of immigration , and asked for his cooperation . There are seven international airports in West Germany . It took roughly five minutes with the computers to find out that you had n't entered any of them during the past three days , which was all I was concerned about . " " But then you had to get to Cologne-Bonn . " " I was there in forty minutes and called him back . No Converse had been admitted , and unless you were crossing the border incognito  --  which I suspect I know more about than you do  --  you had to fly in sooner or later . " " You 're tenacious . " " I 've given you my reasons . " " What about Dowling and that embassy routine at the hotel . " " Lufthansa had you listed on the passenger manifest from Hamburg ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung around the counter in case there was a delay or anything like that when these three embassy guys showed up flashing their ID 's , the head man speaking rotten German . " " You could tell ? " " I speak German  --  and French , Italian , and Spanish . I have to deal with different nationalities . " " I 'll let that pass . " " I suppose that 's why I 'm a lieutenant commander at thirty-four . They move me around a lot . " " Pass again . What caught you about the embassy people ? " " Your name , naturally . They wanted confirmation that you were on flight Eight-seventeen . The clerk sort of glanced at me and I shook nn head ; he cooperated without a break in his conversation . You see , I 'd given him a few deutsche marks but that was n't it . These people do n't really dig the official U.S. over here . " " I heard that last night . From Dowling . How did he come up ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood at the real of the baggage claim ; the embassy boys were by the entrance to the gates about fifty feet away . We all waited until there was only one piece ( ) I luggage on the conveyor belt . It was yours , but you never showed up finally a woman came out and the embassy contingent surrounded her , everyone excited , upset . I heard your name mentioned , but that 's all I heard because by that time I had decided to go back and speak to the lerk  | " To see if I 'd really been on the plane ? " asked Converse . " Or whether I turned out to be a no-show . " " Yes , " agreed Fitzpatrick . " He was cute ; he made me feel like I was suborning a juror . I paid him , and he told me this Caleb Dowling  --  whom I think I was expected to know  --  had stopped at the desk before going out to the platform . " " Where he left instructions , " said Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I picked up a set at the hotel . " " That was it , the hotel . Dowling told him he 'd met this lawyer on the plane , a fellow American named Converse who 'd sat with him since Copenhagen . He was worried that his new friend might not have accommodations in Bonn , and if he asked Lufthansa for suggestions , the clerk should send him to the Konigshof Hotel . " 1* " So you totaled up the figures and decided to become one of the embassy people who 'd lost me , " said Converse , smiling . " To confront Dowling . Who among us has n't taken advantage of a hostile witness ? " " Exactly . I showed him my naval ID and told him I was an attache . Frankly , he was n't very cooperative . " " And you were n't very convincing , according to his theatrical critique . Neither was I. Strangely enough , that 's why he got us together . " Joel stopped , crushed out his cigarette against the wall and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've passed muster or roster or whatever the hell you call it . Where do we stand ? You speak the language and you 've got government connections I do n't have . You could help . " The naval officer stood motionless ; he looked hard at Joel , his eyes blinking in the glare of the sunlight , but not from any lack of concentration . " I 'll do whatever I can , " he began slowly , " as long as it makes sense 4 , to me . But you and I have to understand each other , Converse . I 'm not hacking away from the two days . That 's all you 've got  --  we 've got if I come on board . " " Who made the deadline ? " " I did . I do now . " " It ca n't work that way . " " Who says ? " " I did . I do now . " Converse started walking along the wall . " You 're in Bonn , " said Fitzpatrick , catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his voice , only control . " You 've been to ( ' . Iris and you came to Bonn . That means you have names , areas of evidence , both concrete or hearsay . I want it all . " " You 'll have to do better than that , Commander . " " I made a promise . "  | " To whom ? " " My sister ! You think she does n't know ? It was tearing Press apart ! For a whole goddamned year he 'd get up in the middle of the night and wander around the house , talking to himself but shutting her out . He was obsessed and she could n't crack the shell . You 'd have to know them to appreciate this , but they were good , I mean good together . I know it 's not very fashionable these days to have two people with a passel of kids who really like each other , who ca n't wait to be with each other when they 're apart , but that 's the way they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without breaking his stride . " No , " answered the Navy man , obviously confused by the question . " I expect to be . Perhaps . I told you , I move around a lot . " " So did Press . . . Avery . " " What 's your point , counselor ? " " Respect what he was doing . He knew the dangers and he understood what he could lose . His life . " " That 's why I want the facts ! His body was flown back yesterday . The funeral 's tomorrow and I 'm not there because I gave Meagen a promise ! I 'm coming back too , but with everything I need to blow this whole fucking thing apart ! " " You 'll only implode it , sending it way down deep if you 're not stopped before that . " " That 's your judgment . " " It 's all I 've got . " " I do n't buy it ! " " Do n't . Go back and talk about rumors , about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robbery , or a murder in New York that remains and probably will remain something it was n't . If you mention a man on Mykonos , believe me , he 'll disappear . Where are you , Commander ? Are you just a freak , after all , a philosophical blood brother of Press Halliday who stormed the Presidio and burned his draft card in the good old days of muscatel and grass ? " " That 's a crock of shit ! " " It 's on the record , Commander . By the way , as a judge advocate , how many officers did you prosecute ? " " What ? " " And as defense counsel , how many cases did you lose ? " " I 've had my share of wins and losses , mostly wins , frankly . " " Mostly ? Frankly ? You know there are certain people who can take hi teen numbers , insert what they call variables , and make the statistics say ativthing they want them to say . "  | " What 's that got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death , his murder ? " " Oh , you 'd be surprised , Commander Fitzpatrick . Beneath that brass could be a very successful infiltrator , perhaps even an agent provocateur in a uniform you should n't be wearing . " " What the hell are you talking about ? . . . Forget it , I do n't want to know . I do n't have to listen to you , but you have to listen to me ! You 've got two days , Converse . Am I on board or not ? " Joel stopped and studied the intense young face beside him  --  young and not so young , there were hints of creases around the angry eyes . " You 're not even in the same fleet , " said Converse wearily . " Old Beale was right . It 's my decision and I choose to tell you nothing . I do n't want you on board , sailor . You 're a hotheaded piss ant and you bore me . " Joel turned and walked away . " All right , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I almost believed that drivel . " The director , Roger Blynn , checked the clipboard thrust in front of him by a script girl and issued instructions to the camera crew 's interpreter before heading over to the production table . Caleb Dowling remained seated on the large rock on the slope of the hill above the Rhine ; he patted the head of an odoriferous goat , which had just defecated on the toe of his boot . " I 'd like to kick the rest of the shit out of you , li'l partner , " he said quietly , " but it would n't fit my well-developed image . " The actor got up and stretched , aware that the onlookers beyond the roped-off set were staring at him , chattering away like tourists in a zoo . In a few minutes he would walk over  --  no , not walk , amble over  --  and pull the rope off the carriage of an arc light so he could mingle with the fans . 1 le never tired of it , probably because it came so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolic of what he and his wife currently could afford . Also every now and then there was a bonus : the appearance of one of his former students , who usually approached him cautiously , obviously wondering if the good-natured rapport he had established in the classroom had survived the onslaught of national recognition or been drowned in the tidal wave of so-called stardom . Cal was good at remembering faces , and not too bad with at least one of a person 's two names , so when these occasions arose , lie invariably would eye his former charge and ask him if he had completed yesterday 's assignment . Or would walk up to him  --  or her  --  and pedagogically inquire something like " Of the chronicles Shakespeare drew from for his histories , which had the greatest impact on his language , Daniel , I lolinshed , or Froissart ? " If the answer came back naming the last , he  | would slap his thigh and exclaim words akin to " Hot damn , li'l wrangler , you busted a tough bronc there ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a good life these days , almost perfect . If only some sunlight would reach into the painfully dark corners of his wife 's mind . If it could , she 'd be here on a hillside in Bonn chatting in her quietly vivacious way with the people beyond the rope  --  mostly women , mostly those around her age ? telling them that her husband was really quite like their own . He never picked up his socks and was a disaster in the kitchen ; people liked to hear that even if they did n't believe it . But the sunlight did not reach those far , dark corners . Instead , his Frieda remained in Copenhagen , walking along the beaches of Sjaelland Island , having tea in the botanical gardens , and waiting for a call from her husband saying that he had a few days off and would come out of hated Germany . Dowling looked around at the efficient , enthusiastic crew and the curious spectators ; laughter punctuated their conversations , a certain respect as well . These were not hateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blynn , the film 's director , who was walking rapidly across the slope of the hill . " There 's someone here to see you . " " I hope more than one , Roger . Otherwise the men who go under the dubious title of our employers are grossly overpaying me . " " Not for this pile of kitsch . " The director 's smile disappeared , as he approached the actor . " Are you in any trouble , Cal ? " " Constantly , but not so it 's noticeable . " " I 'm serious . There 's a man here from the German police  --  the Bonn police . He says he has to talk to you , claims it 's urgent . " " What about ? " Dowling felt a rush of pain in his stomach ; it was the fear he lived with . " He would n't tell me . Just that it was an emergency and he had to see you alone . " " Oh , Christ ! " whispered the actor . " Freddie ! ... where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In m " y " Rest easy , " said Blynn . " That stunt jock Moose Rosenberg 's with him . If he moved an ashtray , I think that gorilla would throw him through the wall . " " Thanks , Roger . " " He meant it when he said alone ' ! " Dowling did not hear this ; he had started running across the hill toward the small camper he used for brief periods of relaxation . He prayed to no one in particular for the best , preparing himself for the worst .  | It was neither , simply another complication in an enigma . Frieda Dowling was not the subject ; instead it was Joel Converse , an American attorney-at-law . The stunt man climbed out of the trailer , leaving Caleb and the police officer alone . The man was in civilian clothes , his English fluent , his manner vaguely officious yet courteous . " I 'm sorry to have upset you , Herr Dowling , " said the German in response to Caleb 's initial , intense inquiry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is she ill , perhaps ? " " She 's had a few spells lately , that 's all . She 's in Copenhagen . " " Yes , so we understand . You fly there frequently , do n't you ? " " Whenever I can . " " She does not care to join you here in Bonn ? " " Her name was Oppenfeld , and the last time she was in Germany she was n't considered much of a human being . Her memories are , let 's say , memorable in the extreme . They come back with a lot of acid . " " Yes , " said the police officer , his eyes as steady as Caleb 's . " We will live with that for generations . " " I hope so , " said the actor . " I was n't alive , Herr Dowling . I 'm very happy she survived , I mean that . " Dowling was not sure why but he lowered his voice , the words nearly inaudible , if not involuntary . " Germans helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the German quietly . " My business , however , concerns a man who sat next to you last night on the planes from Copenhagen to Hamburg and from Hamburg to Bonn . His name is Joel Converse , an American attorney . " " What about him ? By the way , may I see your identification ? " " Certainly . " The police officer reached into his pocket , removed his plastic ID case , and handed it to the actor , who had his glasses firmly in place . " I trust everything is in order , " added the man . " What 's this Sonder Dezernat. ? " asked Dowling , squinting at the small print on the card . " It is best translated as ' special ' ? ' branch ' or department . ' We are a unit of the Bundespolizei , the federal police . It is our job to look into matters the government feels are more sensitive than the normal jurisdictional complaints . " " That does n't say a damn thing , and you know it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that in movies and get away with it because we write in all those reactions , but you 're not Helmut Dantine or Martin Kosleck and I 'm not Elissa Landi . Spell it out . " " Very well , I shall spell it out . Interpol . A man died in a Paris hospital  | as a result of head injuries inflicted by the American , Joel Converse . His condition was diagnosed as improving , but unfortunately it was only temporary ; he was found dead this morning . The death is attributed to an unprovoked attack by Herr Converse . We know he flew into KolnBonn , and according to the airline stewardesses , you sat with him for three and a half hours . We want to know where he is . Perhaps you can help us . Dowling removed his glasses , lowering his chin and swallowing as he did so . " And you think I know ? " " We have no idea , but you talked with him . And we hope you do know that there are severe penalties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a killing . " The actor fingered the stems of his glasses , his instincts in conflict , erupting . He walked over to the cot against the wall and sat down , looking up at the police officer . " Why do n't I trust you ? " he asked . " Because you think of your wife and will trust no German , " replied the German . " I am a man of law and peace , Herr Dowling . Order is something the people decide for themselves , myself among them . The report we have received states clearly that this Converse may be a very disturbed man . " He did n't sound disturbed to me . In fact , I thought he had a damned good head on his shoulders . He said a lot of very perceptive things . " " That you wanted to hear ? " " Not all of them . " " But a good percentage , leading up to all of them . " " What does that mean ? " " A madman is convincing ; he plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the essence of his madness , his psychosis , his own convictions . " Dowling dropped the glasses on the cot , exhaling audibly , feeling tlhc pain of fear again in his stomach . " A madman ? " he said without convic tion . " I do n't believe that . " " Then let us have a chance to disprove it . Do you know where he is ? " The actor squinted at the German . " Give me a card or a number where I can reach you . He may get in touch with me . " " Who was responsible ? " The man in the red silk robe behind the large desk sat in semidarkness , a brass lamp serving to throw a harsh circle of light on the surface in front of him . The glow was sufficient to reveal the outlines of a huge map centered on the wall behind the man and the desk It was a strange map , not of the global world but of fragments  | of the world . The shapes of nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if an attempt had been made to create a single landmass out of disparate geographical areas . They included all of Europe , most of the Mediterranean and selected portions of Africa . And as if the wide expanse of the Atlantic Ocean were merely a pale blue connector , Canada and the United States of America were part of this arcane entity . The man stared straight ahead . His lined , square-jawed face , with its aquiline nose and thin , stretched lips , seemed molded from parchment ; his close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair was singularly appropriate for a man with such a rigidly framed torso . He spoke again ; his voice was rather high , with no resonance but with a secure sense of command . One could easily imagine this voice raised in volume  --  even to fever pitch  --  like a tomcat screeching across a frozen lake . It was not raised now , however ; it was the essence of quiet urgency . " Who was responsible ? " he repeated . " Are you still on the line , London ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , of course . I 'm trying to think , trying to be fair . " " I admire that , but decisions have to be made . In all likelihood the responsibility will be shared , we simply have to know the sequence . " The man paused ; when he continued , his voice suddenly took on an intensity that was a complete departure from his previous tone . It was the shrill call of the cat across the ice-bound lake . " How was Interpol involved ? " Startled , the Englishman answered quickly , his phrases clipped , the words rushing headlong over one another . " Bertholdier 's aide was found ( lead at four in the morning , Paris time . Apparently he was to receive hospital medication at that hour . The nurse called the Surete ? " " The Surete ? " shouted the man behind the desk in front of the fragmented map . " Why the Surete ? Why not Bertholdier ? It was his employee , not the Surete'st " " That was the lapse , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect had been left at the hospital desk  --  apparently by an inspector named Prudhomme , who was awakened and told of the man 's death . " " And he was the one who called in Interpol ? " " Yes , but too late to intercept Converse at German immigration . " " For which we can be profoundly grateful , " said the man , lowering his voice . " Normally , of course , the hospital would have waited and reached lertholdier in the morning , telling him what happened . As you say , the patient was an employee , not a member of the family . After that , un-  | doubtedly the arrondissement police would have been informed and finally the Surete . By then our people would have been in place and fully capable of preventing Interpol 's involvement . We can still stop them , but it will take several days . Personnel transfers , new evidence , amendments to the case file ; we need time . " " Then do n't waste any . " " It was those damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for , " said the man in front of the shadowed map . " This Prudhomme 's instincts were aroused . Too many rich people , too much influence , the circumstances too bizarre . He smells something . " " We 'll get him off the case , just a few days , " said the Englishman . " Converse is in Bonn , we know that . We 're closing in . " " So possibly are Interpol and the German police . I do n't have to tell you how tragic that would be . " " We have certain controls through the American embassy . The fugitive is American . " " The fugitive has information ! " insisted the man behind the desk , his fist clenched in the circle of light . " How much and supplied by whom we do n't know and we must know . " " Nothing was learned in New York ? The judge ? " " Only what Bertholdier suspected and what I knew the moment I heard his name . After forty years Anstett came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man was a bull , but only a go-between ; he hated me as much as I hated him , and up to the end he shielded those behind him . Well , he 's gone and his holy righteousness with him . The point is , Converse is not what he pretends to be . Now , find him ! " " As I say , we 're closing in . We have more sources , more informers than Interpol . He 's an American fugitive in Bonn who , we understand , does n't speak the language . There are only so many places he can hide . We 'll find him ; we 'll break him and learn where he comes from . After which , we 'll terminate immediately , of course . " " No ! " The sleek male cat again shrieked across the frozen lake . " We play his game ! We welcome him , embrace him . In Paris he talked about Bonn , Tel Aviv , Johannesburg ; therefore you 'll accommodate him . Bring him to Leifhelm  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrahms from Israel , Van Headmer from Africa , and , yes , Bertholdier from Paris . He obviously knows who they are anyway . He claims ultimately to want a council meeting , to be a part of us . So we 'll hold a conference and listen to his lies . He 'll tell us more with his lies than he can with the truth . " " I really do n't understand . "  | " Converse is a point , but only a point . He 's exploring , studying the forward terrain , trying to understand the tactical forces ahead of him . If he were anything else , he 'd deal directly through legitimate authorities and legitimate methods . There 'd be no reason for him to use a false name or give false information  --  or to run away , forcibly overcoming a man he thinks is trying to stop him . He 's an infantry point who has certain information but does n't know where he 's going . Well , a point can be sucked into a trap , the advancing company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conference ! " " I submit that 's extraordinarily dangerous . He has to know who recruited him , who gave him the names , his sources . We can break him physically or chemically and get that information . " 4 " He probably does n't have it , " explained the man patiently . " Infantry points are not privileged to know command decisions ; frankly , if they were , they might turn back . We have to know more about this Converse , and by six o'clock tonight I 'll have every report , every resume , every word ever written about him . There 's something here we ca n't see . " " We already know he 's resourceful , " said the Britisher . " From what we can piece together in Paris , he 's considered an outstanding attorney . If he sees through us or gets away from us , it could be catastrophic . He will have met with our people , spoken with them . " " Then once you find him do n't let him out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Oh ? " " Those records that are being gathered from all over the country . For a man to do what Converse is doing , he had to be manipulated very carefully , very thoroughly , a driving intensity instilled in him . It 's the manipulators we have to find . They 're not even who we think they are . I 'll be in touch tomorrow . " George Marcus Delavane replaced the telephone in its cradle and slowly , awkwardly twisted his upper body around in the chair . He gazed at the strange , fragmented map as the first light of dawn fired the eastern sky , its orange glow filling the windows . Then , with effort , his hands gripping the arms of the steel chair , he pivoted himself around again , his eyes on the stark pool of light on the desk . He moved his hands to his waist and carefully , trembling , unbuttoned his dark-red velvet jacket , forcing his gaze downward , ordering himself to observe the terrible truth once more . He stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , now commanding his eyes to focus , to accept with loathing what had been done to him .  | There was nothing to see but the edge of the thick steel seat and , below it , the polished wood of the floor . The long , sturdy legs that had carried his trained , muscular body through battles in the snow and the mud , through triumphant parades in the sunlight , through ceremonies of honor and defiance , had been stolen from him . The doctors had told him that his diseased legs were instruments of death that would kill the rest of him . He clenched his fists and pressed them slowly down on the desk , his throat filled with a silent scream .  | " Goddamn you , Converse , who do you think you are ? " cried Connal Fitzpatrick , his voice low , furious , as he caught up with Joel , who was walking rapidly between the tall trees near the Alter Zoll . " Someone who knew Avery Fowler as a boy and watched a man named Press Halliday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Converse , quickening his pace , heading toward the gates of the national landmark where there were taxis . " Do n't pull that crap on me ! I knew Press far better and far longer than you ever did . For Christ 's sake , he was married to my sister ! We were close friends for fifteen years ! " " You sound like a kid playing one-upmanship . Get lost . " Fitzpatrick rushed forward , pivoting in front of Joel , blocking him . " It 's true ! Please , I can help , I want to help ! I know the language ; you do n't ! I have connections here ; you do n't . " " You also have your own idea about a deadline , which I do n't . Get out of my way , sailor . " " Come on , " pleaded the naval officer . " So I did n't get everything I wanted . Do n't crowd me out . " " I beg your pardon ? " Fitzpatrick shifted his weight awkwardly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , counselor ? " " Not if I did n't know the circumstances .

That is , if profits were the primary objective . They would n't coordinate outside ; it is n't necessary . It 's a sellers ' market ; they 'd only water down the profits . " " Bingo , counselor . " " So ? " Fitzpatrick looked at Joel , as they strolled toward a break in the stone wall where a bronzed cannon was in place . " Destabilization , " said Converse . " Mass destabilization . A series of flash points in highly volatile areas that will call into question the ability of democratic governments to cope with the violence . " " I 've got to ask you again , for what purpose ? " " You 're quick , " said Joel , " so I 'll let you answer that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorder , when it cal no longer function , when things are out of control ? " The two men stopped by the cannon , the naval officer 's eyes following the line of the huge , threatening barrel . " It 's restructured or replaced , " he said , turning to look at Converse . " Bingo again , " said Converse softly . " That 's the overview . " " It does n't make sense . " Fitzpatrick creased his eyes in the sunlight , as well as in thought . " Let me recap . Am I allowed ? " " You 're allowed . " " Influential individuals ' connotes people in pretty good standing iii very high places . Assuming we 're not talking about an out-and-out crimi nal element  --  which the lack of a pure profit motive would seem to eliminate  --  we 're talking about reasonably respectable citizens . Is then ? another definition I 'm not aware of ? " " If there is , I 'm not aware of it , either . " " Then why would they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence ? It does n't make sense . " " Ever hear of the phrase Everything 's relative ' ? " " To a fare-thee-well . So what ? " " So think . " " About what ? " " Influence . " Joel took out his cigarettes , shook one to his lips and lighted it . The younger man stared at the Seven Mountains of the Westerwald in the distance . " They want more , " said Fitzgerald slowly , turning back to Converse . " " They want it all , " said Joel . " And the only way they can get it is to prove that their solutions are the only solutions , all others having proved worthless against the eruption of chaos suddenly everywhere . " Connal 's expression was fixed , immobile , as he absorbed Converse 's  | words . " Holy Mary ... " he began , his voice a whisper , yet still a cry . " An international plebiscite  --  the peoples ' will  --  for the almighty state . Fascism . It 's multinational fascism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say Right on , ' counselor . You 've just said it better than any of us . " " Us ? Which is ' we , ' but you do n't know who you are ! " added Fitzpatrick , both bewildered and angry . " Live with it , " said Joel . " As I have . " " y ? " Avery Fowler . Remember him ? " " Oh , Jesus ! " " And an old man on the island of Mykonos . That 's all we have . But what they said is true . It 's real . I 've seen it , and that 's all I need to know . In Geneva , Avery said there was very little time left . Beale refined it ; he called it a countdown . Whatever 's going to happen will happen before your leave is up  --  two weeks and four days is the earliest report . That 's what I meant before . " " Oh my God , " whispered Fitzpatrick . " What else can you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The embassy , " Connal interrupted . " It 's been a couple of years , but I was there . I wbrked with the military attache . I do n't need any introductions . We can get help there . " " We can also get killed there . " " What. ? " " It 's not clean . Those three men you saw at the airport , the ones from the embassy ? " " What about them ? " " They 're on the other side . " " I do n't believe you ! " " Why do you think they were at the airport ? " " To meet you , talk to you . There could be a dozen different reasons . VVhether you know it or not , you 're considered a hotshot lawyer on the international scene . Foreign service personnel frequently want to touch base with guys like you . " " I 've had this conversation before , " said Converse , irritated . " What does that mean ? " " If they wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because they thought you 'd come into the terminal like everybody else . " " And when I did n't  --  according to you  --  they were upset , angry . That 's what you said . "  | " They were . " " All the more reason to meet me at the gate . " Fitzpatrick frowned . " Still , that 's kind of flimsy ? " " The woman . Do you remember the woman ? " " Of course . " " She spotted me in Copenhagen . She followed me . Also , there 's something else . Later , on the platform , all four were picked up by a car belonging to a man we know  --  we know  --  is part of everything I 've described to you . They drove to the embassy , and you 'll have to take my word for that . I saw them . " Connal fixed his gaze on Joel , accepting what he had heard . " Oh , Jesus , " he said . " Okay , no embassy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence unit ; I 've dealt with those people before . " " Not yet . Maybe not at all . " " I thought you wanted to use the uniform , my connections . " " Maybe I will . It 's nice to know they 're there . " " Well , what do you want me to do ? I 've got to do something . " " Are you really fluent in German ? " " Hochdeutsch , Schwdbisch , Bayerisch , and several dialects in between . I told you , I can handle five languages ? " " You 've made it obnoxiously clear , " interrupted Converse . " There 's a woman named Fishbein here in Bonn . That 's the first name I 'm going to give you . She 's involved ; we 're not sure how , but she 's suspected of being a conduit  --  a relayer of information . I want you to meet her , talk with her , establish a relationship . We 'll have to think of something that 'll be convincing in order for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 's the youngest daughter of Hermann Goring . She married a survivor of the holocaust for obvious reasons ; he 's long gone . Any ideas ? " " Sure , " said Fitzpatrick without hesitating . " Inheritance . There are a couple of thousand last wills and testaments every year that the deceased want processed through the military . They 're from crazies who leave everything they 've got to the other survivors . The true Aryan Germanic stock and all that horseshit . We bounce them back to the civil courts , which do n't know what to do with them , so they end up in limbo and eventually in the Treasury Department 's coffers . " " No kidding ? " " . ' ins , zwei , drei . Believe me , those people mean it . " " Can you use the device ? " " I low about a million-plus legacy from a small Midwest brewer of lager " You 'll do , " said noel " You 're on board . "  | Converse did not mention Aquitaine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or twenty-odd names at the State Department and the Pentagon . Nor did he describe the network as it appeared in the dossiers , or as described by Dr. Edward Beale on Mykonos . He gave Connal Fitzpatrick the barest bones of the body of information . Joel 's reasoning was far less benign than he had stated : if the Navy lawyer was taken and interrogated  --  no matter how brutally  --  there was little of substance he could reveal . " You 're not really telling me a hell of a lot , " said Fitzpatrick . " I 've told you enough to get your head blown off , and that 's not a phrase normally in my lexicon . " " Nor mine . " " Then consider me a nice fellow , " said Converse , as the two men headed for the entrance gate of the Alter Zoll . " On the other hand , " continued Halliday 's brother-in-law , " you 've been through a lot more than I ever have . I read that stuff about you in the security files  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files of a lot of other prisoners . You were something else . According to most of the men in those camps , you held them together  --  until they put you into solitary . " " They were wrong , sailor . I was shaking and scared to death and would have fucked a Peking duck to save my skin . " " That 's not what the files say . They say ? " " I 'm really not interested , Commander , " said Joel as they passed through the ornate gate , " but I 've got an immediate problem you can help solve . " " What is it ? " " I gave my word I 'd call Dowling on some mobile phone line . I would n't know how to ask for it . " " There 's a booth over there , " said Connal , pointing to a white plastic bubble that protruded from a concrete pylon on the pavement abutting the drive . " Do you have the number ? " " It 's here somewhere , " replied Converse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said as he separated the scrap of paper from several credit-card charges . " Vermittlung , bitte . " The naval officer sounded authentic as he spoke crisply into the telephone . " Sieben , drei , vier , zwei , zwei . Bitte , Frr ulein . " Fitzpatrick then inserted a series of coins into the metal box and turned to Joel . " Here you are . They 're ringing . " " Stay there . Ask for him  --  say it 's his lawyer calling , the one at the hotel . "  | " Guten Tag , Fraulein. 1st Herr ? Oh , no , I speak English . Do you speak English ? No , I 'm not calling from California , but it 's an emergency . ... Dowling , I have to reach ? " " Caleb , " said Joel quickly . " Caleb Dowling . " The Navy man covered the mouthpiece . " What kind of name is that ? " " Something to do with Gucci shoes . " " What ? . . . fa  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Converse . " They 're getting him . " " Joe ? " " Yes , Cal . I said I 'd call you after I met with Fowler . Everything 's okay . " " No , it 's not , Mr. Lawyer , " said the actor quietly . " You and I had better have a very serious talk , and I do n't mind telling you a hunk of beef named Rosenberg will be just a few feet away . " " I do n't understand . " " A man died in Paris . Does that clear things up for you ? " " Oh , God . " Converse felt the blood draining from his head and a hollowness in his throat . For a moment he thought he was going to be sick . " They came to you ? " he whispered . " A man from the German police a little over an hour ago , and this time I did n't have any doubts about my visitor . He was the real item . " " I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? " " I . . . I guess I did . " Converse stared at the telephone dial , seeing the bloodied face of the man in the alleyway , feeling the blood on his own fingers . " You guess ? That 's not something you guess about . " " Then yes . . . . The answer is yes . I did it . " " Did you have a reason ? " " I thought I did . " " I want to hear it , but not now . I 'll tell you where to meet me . " " No ! " exclaimed Joel , confused but emphatic . " I ca n't involve you . You ca n't be involved ! " " This fellow gave me a card and wants me to call him if you got in touch with me . I lc was very specific about withholding information , how it 's considered aiding a fugitive . " " I is was right , ahsolutell. right ! For God 's sake , tell him everything , The tint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you thought I might not have a re%crvatiou and we had a pleasant few hours on the plane You put it ni wilt name because you did n't want me to pay .

It was a shock and I 'm a fellow American and you 're in a foreign country . You wanted time to think , to reflect . My phone call shook you into behaving rationally . Tell him you confronted me with the accusation and I did n't deny it . Be honest with him , Cal . " " How honest ? Should I include my session with Fowler ? " " That 's all right , too , but it 's not necessary . Let me back up and clarify . Fowler 's a false name and he 's not relevant to Paris , I give you my word . Bringing him in is only volunteering an unnecessary complication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alter Zoll ? " " It 's where I 'm calling you from . I just admitted it . " " You wo n't be able to go back to the Konigshof . " " It does n't matter , " said Joel , speaking rapidly , wanting to get off the phone and start thinking . " My luggage is at the airport and I ca n't go back t here either . " " You had a briefcase . " " I 've taken care of that . It 's where I can get it . " The actor paused , then spoke slowly . " So your advice to me is to level with the police , to tell them the truth . " " Without volunteering extraneous and unrelated material . Yes , that 's Iny advice , Cal . It 's the way you can stay clean and you are clean . " " It sounds like fine advice , Joe  --  Joel , and I certainly wish I could take it , but I 'm afraid I ca n't . " " What ? Why. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't give advice like that . It 's not in any script I ever read . " " That 's nonsense ! For Christ 's sake , do as I tell you ! " " Sorry , pardner , it 's not good dramaturgy . So you do as I tell you . There 's a big stone building at the university  --  beautiful place , a restored palace actually  --  with a layout of gardens you do n't see very often . They 're on the south side with benches here and there on the main path . It 's a nice place on a summer 's night , kind of out of the way and not too crowded . Be there at ten o'clock . " " Cal , I wo n't involve you in this ! " " I 'm already involved . I 've withheld information and I 've aided a fugit ive . " Dowling paused again . " There 's someone I want you to meet , " he said . " No . " There was a click and the line went dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sides of the plastic booth , trying to clear his head . He had killed a man , not in a war anyone knew about , and not in the heat of survival in a Southeast Asian jungle . but in a Paris alleyway because he had to make an instant decision based on probabilities . Rightly or wrongly the act had been done and he could not dwell on it . The German police were looking for him , which meant that Interpol had entered the picture , transmitting the information front Paris somehow supplied by Jacques-Louis Bertholdier , who remained out of sight , beyond the scope of the hunt . Joel recalled his own words spoke only minutes ago . If Press Halliday 's life was not terribly important coin pared with what he was going after , neither was the life of a minion wilt , worked for Bertholdier , Delavane 's disciple , Aquitaine 's arm in France ? There were no options , thought Converse . He had to go on ; he had t stay free . " What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You look like you got kicked by a mule . " " I got kicked , " agreed Converse . " What happened to Dowling ? Is he in trouble ? " " I It will be ! " exploded Joel . " Because he 's a misguided idiot who thuiks he 's in some kind of goddanuicd movie ! " " ' I'h:it was n't your opinion a little while ago . "  | " We met ; it came out all right . This ca n't , not for him . " Converse pushed himself away from the booth and looked at the Navy lawyer , his mind now trying desperately to concentrate on the immediate . " I may tell you and I may not , " he said , glancing around for an available taxi . " Come on , we 're going to put your awesome linguistic abilities to work . We need shelter , expensive but not showy , especially not a place where the wellheeled tourists go who do n't speak German . If there 's one thing they 'll spread about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five boroughs of New York . I want a rich hotel that does n't need foreigners , does n't cater to them . Do you know the kind of place I mean ? " Fitzpatrick nodded . " Exclusive , clubby , German business-oriented . Every large city has hotels like that , and they 're always twenty times my per diem for breakfast . " " That 's okay , I 've got money here in Bonn . I might as well try to get it out . " " You 're full of surprises , " said Connal . " I mean real surprises . " " Do you think you can handle it ? Find a hotel like that ? " " I can explain what I want to a cabdriver ; he 'll probably know . Bonn 's small , nothing like New York or London or Paris . . . . There 's a taxi letting people out . " The two men hurried to the curb , where the cab was discharging a quartet of passengers balancing camera equipment and outsized Louis Vuitton handbags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Converse as they nodded to the tourists , two couples in the midst of an argument , male versus female , Nikon versus Vuitton . " A combination of what we both said , " answered Fitzpatrick . " A quiet , nice hotel away from the Ausldnderldrm . " " What ? " " The clamor of tourists  --  and worse . I 'll tell him we 're calling on some very important German businessmen  --  bankers , say  --  and we 'd like a place they 'd be most comfortable in for confidential meetings . He 'll get the drift . " " He 'll see we do n't have any luggage , " objected Joel . " He 'll see the money in my hand first , " said the naval officer , holding the door for Converse . Lieutenant Commander Connal Fitzpatrick , USN , member of the miliary bar and limited thereby , impressed Joel Converse , vaunted internaicnnal attorney , to the point where the latter felt foolish . Effortlessly the avy lawyer got them in a two-bedroom suite at an inn on the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those converted prewar  | estates where most of the guests seemed to have at least a nodding acquaintance with several others and the clerks rarely looked anyone iii the eye , as if tacitly confirming their subservience  --  or the fact that they would certainly not acknowledge having seen Herr So-and-So should someone ask them . Fitzpatrick had begun his campaign with the taxi driver by leaning forward in the seat and speaking rapidly and quietly . Their exchanges seemed to grow more confidential as the cab sped toward the heart of the city ; then it abruptly veered away , crossing the railroad tracks that inter sected the capital , and entered a smooth road paralleling the river north Joel had started to speak , to ask what was happening , but the Navy lawyer had held up his hand , telling Converse to be quiet . Once they had stopped at the entrance of an inn , reached by an interminably long , manicured drive , Fitzpatrick got out . " Stay here , " he said to Joel . " I 'll see if I can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Twelve minutes later Connal returned , his demeanor stern , his eyes , however , lively . " Come on , Chairman of the Board , we 're going straight up . " He paid the driver handsomely and once again held the door for Converse  --  now a touch more deferentially , thought Joel . The lobby of Das Rektorat was unmistakably German , with oddly delicate Victorian overtones ; thick heavy wood and sturdy leather chairs were beside and below filigrees of brass ornamentation forming arches over doorways , elegant borders for large mirrors , and valances above thick bay windows where none were required . One 's first impression was of a quiet , ' expensive spa from decades ago , its solemnity lightened by flashes of reflecting metal and glass . It was a strange mixture of the old and the very old . It smelled of money . Fitzpatrick led Converse to a paneled elevator recessed in the paneled corridor ; no bellboy or manservant was in attendance . It was a small enclosure , room for no more than four people , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elevator ascended two stories . " I think you 'll approve of the accommodations , " said Connal . " I checked them out ; that 's why it took me so long . " " We 're back in the nineteenth century , you know , " countered Joel . " I trust they have telephones and not just the Hessian express . " " All the most modern communications , I made sure of that , too . " The elevator door opened . " ' Phis way , " said Fitzpatrick , gesturing to the right " The suite 's at the end of the hall " ? Hie suite ? " " . You said you had money uc Bonn . "  | Two bedrooms flanked a tastefully furnished sitting room , with French doors that opened onto a small balcony overlooking the Rhine . The rooms were sunlit and airy , the decor of the walls again an odd mixture : a reproduction of an Impressionist floral arrangement was beside dramatic prints of past champion horses from the leading German tracks and breeding farms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking out the open French doors , then turning back to Connal Fitzpatrick , who stood in the middle of the room , the key still in his hand . " How did you do it ? " " It was n't hard , " replied the Navy lawyer , smiling . " You 'd be surprised what a set of military papers will do for a person in this country . The older guys sort of stiffen up and look like boxer puppies smelling a pot roast , and there are n't that many people here much under sixty . " 4 " That does n't tell me anything unless you 're enlisting us . " " It does when I combine it with the fact that I 'm an aide assigned by the U.S. Navy to accompany an important American financier over here to hold confidential meetings with his German counterparts . While in Bonn , naturally , incognito is the best means for my eccentric financier to travel . Everything 's in my name . " " What about reservations ? " " I told the manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having too many people you might know . I also hinted that those countryInen of his you 're going to meet might be most appreciative of his cooperation . He agreed that I might have a point there . " " How did we hear about this place ? " asked Joel , still suspicious . " Simple . I remembered it from several conversations I had at the International Economic Conference in Dusseldorf last year . " " You were there ? " " I did n't know there was one , " said Fitzpatrick , heading for the door on the left . " I 'll take this bedroom , okay ? It 's not as large as the other one and that 's the way it should be , since I 'm an aide  --  which Jesus , Mary , and Joseph all know is the truth . " " Wait a minute , " Converse broke in , stepping forward . " What about cnir luggage ? Since we do n't have any , did n't that strike your friend downstairs as a little odd for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Connal , turning . " It 's still in the city at that unnamed hotel you rejected so emphatically after twenty minutes . But only I can pick it up . " " Why ? " Fitzpatrick brought his index finger to his lips . " You also have a compulsion for secrecy . Remember , you 're eccentric . "  | " The manager bought all that swill ? " " He calls me Kommandant . " " You 're quite a bullshitter , sailor . " " I remind you , sir , that in the land of Erin go bragh it 's called good healthy blarney . And although you lack certain qualifications , Press said you were a master of it in negotiations . " Connal 's expression became serious . " He meant it in the best way , counselor , and that 's not bullshit . " As the Navy lawyer began walking to the bedroom , Joel felt an odd sense of recognition but could not define it . What was it about the younger man that struck a chord in him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lack of fear in small things that cautioi would later teach him often led to larger things . He tested waters bravely . he had never come close to drowning . Suddenly Converse understood the recognition . What he saw in Cols nal Fitzpatrick was himself  --  before things had happened . Before he had I learned the meaning of fear , raw fear . And finally of loneliness . It was agreed that Connal would return to the Cologne-Bonn airport , not for Joel 's luggage but for his own , which was stored in a locker in tin baggage-claim area . He would then go into Bonn proper , buy an expensive suitcase and fill it with a half-dozen shirts , underwear , socks and best off-the-rack clothing he could find in Joel 's sizes  --  namely , three pairs of trousers , a jacket or two and a raincoat . It was further agreed that casual clothes were the most appropriate ; an eccentric financier was permitted such lapses of sartorial taste , and also such attire more successfully con cealed their non-custom-made origins . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rektorat was at a second locker in tlu ? railroad station where Converse had left his attache case . Once the case was in the Navy lawyer 's possession and the taxi waiting outside had picked up its passenger , there were to be no further stops . The cab WAS to drive directly to the countryside inn . " I wanted to ask you something , " said Fitzpatrick just before leaving " Back at the Alter Zoll you said something about how they ' would spread the word that you could n't talk your way through the five boroughs of New York . I gathered that referred to the fact that you do n't speak German . " *  | Joel hesitated . " A little wider , I 'm afraid , " he said , choosing his words carefully . " You 'll have to know but not now , not yet . Later . " " Why later ? Why not now ? " " Because it would n't do you a damned bit of good , and it might raise questions you would n't want raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's elliptical . " " It certainly is . " " Is that it ? Is that all you 'll say ? " " No . There 's one other thing . I want my briefcase . " Fitzpatrick had assured him that the switchboard of Das Rektorat was capable of handling telephone calls in English  --  as well as at least six other languages , including Arabic  --  and he should have no qualms about placing a call to Lawrence Talbot in New York . " Christ , where are you , Joel ? " Talbot shouted into the phone . " Amsterdam , " replied Converse , not wanting to say Bonn and having had the presence of mind to make the call station-to-station . " I want to know what happened to Judge Anstett , Larry . Can you tell me anything ? " " I want to know what 's happened to you ! Rene called last night .... " " Mattilon ? " " You told him you were flying to London . " " I changed my mind . " " What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no choice . Ile had to tell them who you were . " Talbot suddenly paused , then spoke in a calmer voice , a false voice . " Are you all right , Joel ? Is there something you want to tell me , something bothering you ? " " Something bothering me ? " " Listen to me , Joel . We all know what you went through , and we admire you , respect you . You 're the finest we 've got in the international division ? " I 'm the only one you 've got , " Converse broke in , trying to think , trying to buy time as well as information . " What did Rene say ? Why did he call you ? " " You sound like your old self , fella . " " I am my old self , Larry . What did Rene call you about ? Why were the police with him ? " Joel could feel the slippage ; he was entering another sphere and he knew it , accepted it . The lies would follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement were paramount . He had to stay free ; there was so much to do , so little time .  | " He called me back after the police left to fill me in  --  incidentally , they were from the Surete . As he understood it , the driver of a limousine was assaulted outside the George Cinq 's service entrance ? " " The driver of a limousine ? " interrupted Converse involuntarily . " They said he was a chauffeur ? " " From one of those high-priced services that ferry around people who make odd stops at odd hours . Very posh and very confidential . Apparently the fellow was pretty well smashed up and they say you did it . No one knows why , but you were identified and they say the man may not live . " " Larry , this is preposterous ! " objected Joel , his protestation accompanied by feigned outrage . " Yes , I was there  --  in the area  --  but it had nothing to do with me ! Two hotheads got into a fight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get my head handed to me . I got out of there , and before I found a taxi I yelled at the doorman to call for help . The last thing I saw he was blowing his whistle and running toward the alley . " " You were n't even involved , then , " said Talbot . The statement was a lawyer 's positive fact . " Of course not ! Why would I be ? " " That 's what we could n't understand . It did n't make sense . " " It does n't make sense . I 'll call Rene and fly back to Paris , if I have to . " Yes , do that , " agreed Talbot haltingly . " I should tell you I may have aggravated the situation . " " You ? How ? " " I told Mattilon that perhaps you were . . . well , not yourself . When I spoke with you in Geneva , you sounded awful , Joel . Just plain awful . " " Good God , how did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dies in front of me bleeding from a dozen bullet wounds . How would you feel ? " " I understand , " said the lawyer in New York , " but then Rene thought he saw something in you  --  heard something  --  that disturbed him , too . " " Oh , come on , will you people get off it ! " Converse 's thoughts raced ; every word he spoke had to be credible , his now diminished " outrage " rooted in belie ' ability . " Mattilon saw me after I 'd been flying in and out of airports for damn near fourteen hours . Christ , I was exhausted ! " " Joel ? " Talbot began , obviously not quite ready to get off it . " Why did you tell Rene you were in Paris for the firm ? " Converse paused , not for lack of a response but for effect . He was ready for the question ; he had been ready when he first approached Mattilon " A white lie , Larry , and no harm to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way to get it . "  | " About this Bertholdier ? He 's the general , is n't he ? " " He turned out to be the wrong source . I told Rene as much , and he could n't agree with me more . " Joel lightened his tone of voice . " Also it would have appeared strange if I 'd said I was in Paris for somebody else , would n't it ? I do n't think it would have done the firm any good . Rumors and speculation run rampant down our corridors ; you told me that once . " Yes , and it 's true . You did the right thing .... Damn it , Joel , why the hell did you leave the hotel the way you did ? From the basement , or wherever it was . " It was the moment for expressing with total conviction a small inconsequential untruth that if not carried off would lead to the larger , far more dangerous lie . Connal Fitzpatrick could do it well , reflected Converse . The Navy lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know they were spoors that could lead one back to a rat cage in the Mekong River . " Bubba , my friend and sole support , " said Joel , as cavalierly as he could muster . " I owe you many things , but not the intimacies of my private life . " " The what of your what ? " " I am approaching middle age  --  at least it 's not far off  --  and I have no matrimonial encumbrances or guilt about fidelity . " " You were avoiding a woman ? " " Fortunately for the firm , not a man . " " Jee-sus ! I 'm so well into middle age I do n't think about those things . Sorry , young fella . " " Young and not so young , Larry . " " We were all off base then . You 'd better call Rene right away and get this thing cleared up . I ca n't tell you how relieved I am . " " You can tell me about Anstett . That 's why I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . " A terrible thing , a tragedy . What did the papers over there say ? " Converse was caught ; he had not anticipated the question . " Very little , " he replied , trying to remember what Fitzpatrick had told him . " Just that he was shot and apparently nothing was taken from his apartment . " " That 's right . Naturally , the first thing Nathan and I thought of was you , and whatever the hell you 're involved with , but that was n't the case . It was a Mafia vendetta , pure and simple . You know how rough Anstett was on appeals from those people ; he 'd throw them out as fast as he 'd call their attorneys a disgrace to the profession . "  | " It was a confirmed Mafia killing ? " " It will be , and that 's straight from O'Neil down at the commissioner 's office . They know their man ; he 's an executioner for the Delvecchio family and last month Anstett threw the key away on Delvecchio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no appeals left ; the Supreme Court wo n't touch him . " " They know the man ? " " It 's only a matter of picking him up . " " How come it 's so clear-cut ? " asked Joe , confused . " The usual way , " said Talbot . " An informer who needs a favor . And since everything 's happened so fast and so quietly , it 's assumed that the ballistics will prove out . " " So fast ? So quietly ? " " The informer reached the police first thing this morning . A special unit was dispatched and only they know the man 's identity . They figure the gun will still be in his possession . He 'll be picked up anytime now ; he lives in Syosset . " Something was wrong , thought Converse . There was an inconsistency , but he could not spot the flaw . Then it came to him . " Larry , if everything 's so quiet , how do you know about it ? " " I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I might as well tell you ; it 'll probably be in the newspaper follow-ups anyway . O'Neil 's keeping me posted ; call it courtesy , and also because I 'm nervous . " " Why ? " ? " Except for the man who killed him , I was the last person to see Anstett alive . " " You ? " " Yes . After Rene 's second call I decided to phone the judge , after conferring with Nathan , of course . When I finally reached Anstett , I said I had to see him . He was n't happy about it but I was adamant . I explained that it concerned you . All I knew was that you were in terrible trouble and something had to be done . I went over to his apartment on Central Park South and we talked . I told him what had happened and how frightened I was for you , frankly letting him know that I held him responsible . He did n't say much , but I think he was frightened , too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . I left , and according to the coroner 's report , he was killed approximately three hours later . " Joel 's breath was short , his head splitting . His concentration was absolute . " Let nle get this straight , harry . You went over to Anstett 's apartment after Rene 's call  --  his second call . After he told the Surete who I was "  | " That 's right . " " How long was it ? " " How long was what ? " " Before you left for Anstett 's . After you spoke with Mattilon . " " Well , let me see . Naturally , I wanted to talk to Nathan first , but he was out to dinner , so I waited . Incidentally , he concurred and offered to join me ? " " How long , Larry ? " " An hour and a half , two hours at the outside . " Two hours plus three hours totaled five hours . More than enough time for the killer puppets to be put in place . Converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had been done . Things had suddenly erupted in Paris , and in New York an agitated Lawrence Talbot had been followed to an apartment on Central Park South , where someone , somewhere , recognized a name and a man and the part he had played against Aquitaine . Were it otherwise , Talbot would be the corpse , not Lucas Anstett . All the rest was a smoke screen behind which the disciples of George Marcus Delavne manipulated the puppets . " ? and the courts owed so much to him , the country owed so much . " Talbot was speaking , but Joel could no longer listen . " I have to go , Larry , " he said , hanging up . The killing was obscene . That it was carried out so quickly , so efficiently and with such precise deception was as frightening as anything Converse could imagine . Joseph ( Joey the Nice ) Albanese drove his Pontiac down the quiet , treelined street in Syosset , Long Island , waving to a couple in a front yard . The husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stopped what they were doing , smiled and waved back . Very nice . His neighbors liked him , thought Joey . They considered him a sweet guy and very generous , what with letting the kids use his pool and serving their parents only the best booze when they dropped over and the biggest steaks money could buy when he had weekend barbecues  --  which he did often , rotating the neighbors so no one should feel left out . He was a sweet guy , mused Joey . He was always pleasant and never raised his voice in anger to anyone , offering only a glad hand , a nice word and a happy smile to everybody , no matter how lousy he really felt . That was it , goddamn it ! thought Joey . Irra  --  fuckin ' ? gardless of how upset he was , he never let it show ! Joey the Nice was what they called him and they were right . Sometimes he figured he had to be some kind of saint ? may Jesus Christ forgive him for having such thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in truth he felt like smashing his fist through the windshield and shoving the glass down their throats . It was n't them , it was last night that did it ! A crazy night , a crazy hit , everything crazy ! And that gumba they brought in from the West Coast , the one they called Major , he was the nuttiest fruitcake of them all ! And a sadist to boot , the way he beat the shit out of that old man and the crazy questions he asked , and shouting all the time . Tutti pazzi ! One minute he 's playing cards in the Bronx , and the next the phone is ringing . Get down to Manhattan fast ! A bad heat is needed attualmente ! So he goes and what does he find ? It 's that iron-balled judge , the one who closed the steel doors on Delvecchio 's boy ! What craziness ! They 'll trace it back to the old man for sure . He 'll know such afflizione from the cops and the courts he 'll be lucky to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back . Then maybe  --  just maybe  --  thought Joey at the time , there was a turning muscle in the organization . Old Delvecchio was losing his grip ; just maybe it was being called for , this afflizione that surely would follow . And possibly  --  just possibly  --  Joey himself was being tested . Maybe he was too nice , too soave , to put the bad heat on someone like the old judge who gave them all such a hard time . Well , he was n't . No sirree , the nice stopped with the handle of a gun . It was his job , his profession . The Lord Jesus decided who should live and who should die , only He spoke through mortal men on earth who told people like Joey whom to hit . There was no moral dilemma for Joey the Nice . It was important , however , that the orders always come from a man with respect ; that was necessary . They did last night ; the order came from a man with great respect . Although Joey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years about the powerful padrone in Washington , D.C. The name was whispered , never spoken out loud . Joey touched the brakes of his car , slowing down so as to swing into his driveway . His wife , Angie , would be pissed off at him , maybe shout a little because he did n't come home last night . One more irritation on top of all the craziness , but what the hell was he going to say ? Sorry , Angie , but I was gainfully employed throwing six bullets into an old guy who definitely discriminated against Italians . So , you see , Angie , I had to stay across the the bridge iu Jersey where one of the paesans I played cards with and who 'll swear I was there all night happens to be the chief of police . But , of course , he would never go into such details with his wife . That was his own law . No matter how aggravated he was he never brought the job ( tome Mote husbands should lw like him and there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fucking kids had left a bicycle in front of the attached garage ; he would n't be able to open the automatic door and drive inside . He 'd have to get out . Shit ! One more aggravation . He could n't even park by the Millers ' curb next door ; some creep 's car was there but it was n't the Millers ' Buick . Double shit ! Joey brought the Pontiac to a stop halfway into the sloping driveway and got out . He went up to the bike and leaned down . The rotten kid did n't even use the kickstand and Joey hated bending over , what with his heavy gut and all . " Joseph Albanese ! " Joey the Nice spun around , crouching , reaching under his jacket . That tone of voice was used by only one type of slime ! He pulled out his .38 and dove toward the grille of his car . The explosions reverberated throughout the neighborhood . Birds fluttered out of trees and there were screams along the block in the bright afternoon sunlight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rivulets of blood slowly rolling down the shiny chrome . Joey the Nice had been caught in the fire , and gripped in his hand was the gun lie had used so effectively the night before . Ballistics would prove out . The killer of Lucas Anstett was dead . The judge had been the victim of a gangland assassination , and as far as the world was concerned , it had nothing to do with events taking place six thousand miles away in Bonn , Germany . Converse stood on the small balcony , his hands on the railing , looking down at the majestic river beyond the forest of trees that formed the banks of the Rhine . It was past seven o'clock ; the sun was going below the mountains in the west , its orange rays shooting up , creating blocks of shadows over the earth  --  moving shadows that floated across the waters iii the descending distance . The vibrant colors were hypnotic , the breezes cooling , but nothing could stop the pounding echo in his chest . Where was Fitzpatrick ? Where was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop thinking , to stop his imagination from catapulting into frightening possibilities ... . There was a sudden harsh echo , not from his chest but from inside the room . He turned quickly as the door opened and Connal Fitzpatrick stood there , removing his key from the lock . He stepped aside , letting a uniformed porter enter with two suitcases , instructing the man to leave t hem on the floor while he reached into his pocket for a tip . The porter Icft and the Navy lawyer stared at Joel . There was no attache case in his hand .  | " Where is it ? " said Converse , afraid to breathe , afraid to move . " I did n't pick it up . " " Why not ? " cried Joel , rushing forward . " I could n't be sure . . . maybe it was just a feeling , I do n't know . " " What are you talking about ? " " I was at the airport for seven hours yesterday , going from counter to counter asking about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the Lufthansa desk and the same clerk was there . When I said hello , he did n't seem to want to acknowledge me ; he looked nervous , and I could n't understand . I came back out of the baggage claim with my suitcase and watched him . I remembered how he had glanced at me last night , and as I passed him I swore his eyes kept shooting to the center of the terminal , but there were so many people , so much confusion , I could n't be certain . " " You think you were picked up ? Followed ? " " That 's just it , I do n't know . When I was shopping in Bonn , I went from store to store and every now and then I 'd turn around , or shift my head , to see if I could spot anyone . A couple of times I thought I saw the same people twice , but then again , it was always crowded , and  --  again ? I could n't be sure . But I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What about when you were in the taxi ? Did you ? " " Naturally . I kept looking out the rear window . Even during the drive out here . Several cars made the same turns we did , but I told the driver to slow down and they passed us . " " Did you watch where they went after they passed you ? " " What was the point ? " " There is one , " said Joel , recalling a clever driver who followed .1 deep-red Mercedes limousine . " All I knew was that you 're pretty uptight about that attache case . I do n't know what 's in it and I figure you do n't want anyone else to know , either . " " Bingo , counselor . " There was a knocking at the door , and although it was soft , it had the effect of a staccato burst of thunder . Both men stood motionless , thcii eyes riveted on the door . " Ask who it is , " whispered Converse . ist da , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . There was a brief reply in German and Connal breathed again . " It 's okay . It 's a message for me nil the manage ' Ile probably wants to sell us a contemner room The Navy lawyer went to the door and opened it  | However , it was not the manager , or a bellboy , or a porter bringing a message from the manager . Instead , standing there , was a slender , elderly man in a dark suit with erect posture and very broad shoulders . He glanced first at Fitzpatrick , then looked beyond at Converse . " Excuse me , please , Commander , " he said courteously , walking through the door , and approached Joel , his hand outstretched . " Herr Converse , may I introduce myself ? The name is Leifhelm . Erich Leifhelm. "  | Joel took the German 's hand , too stunned to do anything else . " Field Marshal . . . ? " he uttered , instantly regretting it  --  he could at least have had the presence of mind to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed across Converse 's mind as he looked at the man  --  his straight hair , still more blond than white , his pale-blue eyes glacial , his pinkish skin lined , waxen , as if preserved for decades to come . " An old title and one , thankfully , I have not heard in many years . But you flatter me . You were sufficiently interested to learn something of my past . " " Not very much . " " I suspect enough . " Leifhelm turned to Fitzpatrick . " I apologize for my little ruse , Commander . I felt it was best . " Fitzpatrick shrugged , bewildered . " You know each other , apparently . " " Of one another , " corrected the German . " Mr. Converse came to Bonn to meet with me , but I imagine he 's told you that . " " No , I have n't told him that , " said Joel . I , cifhchn turned back , studying Converse 's eyes . " I see . Perhaps we should talk privately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzpatrick . " Commander , I 've taken up tcx ) ncuch of your time . Why not go downstairs to dinner and I 'll join you In a while ? "  | " Whatever you say , sir , " said Connal , an officer assuming the status of an aide . He nodded and left , closing the door firmly behind him . " A lovely room , " said Leifhelm , taking several steps toward the open French doors . " And with such a lovely view . " " How did you find me ? " asked Converse . " Him , " replied the former field marshal , looking at Joel . " Ein Offizier , according to the front desk . Who is he ? " " How ? " repeated Converse . " He spent hours last night at the airport inquiring about you ; many remembered him . He was obviously a friend . " " And you knew he 'd checked his luggage ? That he 'd be back for it ? " " Frankly , no . We thought he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , please , who is he ? " Joel understood it was vital that he maintain a level of arrogance , as he had done with Bertholdier in Paris . It was the only route he could take with such men ; to be accepted by them , they had to see something of themselves in him . " He 's not important and he knows nothing . He 's a legal officer in the Navy who 's worked in Bonn before and is over here now , I gather , on personal business . A prospective fiancee , I think he mentioned . I saw him the other week ; we chatted , and I told him I was flying in today or tomorrow and he said he 'd make it a point to meet me . He 's obsequious , and persistent . I 'm sure he has delusions of a civilian practice . Naturally  --  under the circumstances  --  I used him . As you did . " " Naturally . " Leifhelm smiled ; he was polished . " You gave him no arrival time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Oh , yes , Paris . We must discuss Paris . " " I spoke to a friend who deals with the Surete . The man died . " " Such men do . Frequently . " " They said he was a driver , a chauffeur . He was n't . " " Would it have been wiser to say he was a trusted associate of General Jacques-Louis Bertholdier ? " " Obviously not . They say I killed him . " " You did . We gather it was an uncontrollable miscalculation , no doubt brought on by the man himself . " " Interpol 's after me . " " We , too , have friends ; the situation will change . You have nothing to fear  --  as long as we have nothing to fear . " The German paused , glancing around the room . " May I sit down ? " " Please . Shall I ring for a drink ? "  | " I drink only light wine and very sparingly . Unless you wish . . . it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Converse as Leifhelm sat in a chair nearest the balcony doors . Joel would sit when he felt the moment was right , not before . " You took extraordinary measures at the airport to avoid us , " continued Hitler 's youngest field marshal . " I was followed from Copenhagen . " " Very observant of you . You understand no harm was intended . " " I did n't understand anything . I just did n't like it . I did n't know what effect Paris would have on my arrival in Bonn , what it meant to you . " " What Paris meant ? " asked Leifhelm rhetorically . " Paris meant that a man , an attorney using a false name , said some very alarming things to a most distinguished and brilliant statesman . This attorney , who called himself Simon , said he was flying to Bonn to see me . On his way  --  and I 'm sure with provocation  --  he kills a man , which tells us something ; he 's quite ruthless and very capable . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more . Where he goes , whom he meets . In our position , would you have done otherwise ? " It was the moment to sit down . " I would have done it better . " " Perhaps if we 'd known how resourceful you were , we might have been less obvious . Incidentally , what happened in Paris ? What did that man do to provoke you ? " " He tried to stop me from leaving . " " Those were not his orders . " " Then he grossly misunderstood them . I 've a few bruises on my chest and neck to prove it . I 'm not in the habit of physically defending myself , and I certainly had no intention of killing him . In fact , I did n't know I had . It was an accident purely in self-defense . " " Obviously . Who would want such complications ? " " Exactly , " agreed Converse bluntly . " As soon as I can rearrange my last hours in Paris so as to eliminate any mention of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to the police . " " As the adage goes , that may be easier said than done . You were seen talking together at L'Etalon Blanc . Undoubtedly , the general was recognized later when he carne to the hotel ; he 's a celebrated man . No , I think you 'd be wiser to let us handle it . We can , you know . " Joel looked hard at the German , his eyes cold yet questioning . " I admit there are risks doing it my way . I do n't like them and neither would my client On the other hand , I ca n't go around being hunted by the police . " " The hunt will be called off It will be necessary for you to remain out of sight for a few days , but by then new instructions will he issued from  | Paris . Your name will disappear from the Interpol lists ; you 'll no longer be sought . " " I 'll want assurances , guarantees . " " What better could you have than my word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could have far more to lose than you . " Converse controlled his astonishment . Leifhelm had just told him a great deal , whether he knew it or not . The German had as much as admitted he was part of a covert organization that could not take any chance of exposure . It was the first concrete evidence Joel had heard . Somehow it was too easy . Or were these elders of Aquitaine simply frightened old men ? " I 'll concede that , " said Converse , crossing his legs . " Well , General , you found me before I found you , but then , as we agreed , my movements are restricted . Where do we go from here ? " " Precisely where you wanted to go , Mr. Converse . When you were in Paris , you spoke of Bonn , Tel Aviv , Johannesburg . You knew whom to reach in Paris and whom to look for in Bonn . That impresses us greatly ; we must assurne you know more . " " I 've spent months in detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But who are you ? Where do you come from ? " Joel felt a sharp , sickening ache in his chest . He had felt it many times before ; it was his physical response to imminent danger and very real fear . " I am who I want people to think I am , General Leifhelm . I 'm sure you can understand that . " " I see , " said the German , watching him closely . " A sworn companion of the prevailing winds , but with the power beneath to carry you to your own destination . " " That 's a little heavy , but I guess it says it . As to where I come from , I 'm sure you know that by now . " Five hours . More than enough time to put the puppets in place . A killing in New York ; it had to be dealt with . " Only bits and pieces , Mr. Converse . And even if we knew more , how could we be certain it 's true ? What people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you , General ? " " Ausgezeichnet ! " said Leifhelm , slapping his knee and laughing . It was a genuine laugh , the man 's waxen face creasing with humor . " You are a fine lawyer , mein Herr . You answer  --  as they say in English  --  a pointed question with another question that is both an answer and an indictment . " " Under the circumstances , it 's merely the truth . Nothing more . " " Also modest . Very commendable , very attractive . "  | Joel uncrossed his legs , then crossed them again impatiently . " I do n't like compliments , General . I do n't trust them  --  under the circumstances . You were saying before about where I wanted to go , about Bonn , Tel Aviv , and Johannesburg . What did you mean ? " " Only that we have complied with your wishes , " said Leifhelm , spreading his hands in front of him . " Rather than your making such tedious trips , we have asked our representatives in Tel Aviv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fly to Bonn for a conference . With you , Mr. Converse . " He had done it ! thought Joel . They were frightened  --  panicked was perhaps the better description . Despite the pounding and the pain in his chest , he spoke slowly , quietly . " I appreciate your consideration , but in all frankness , my client is n't ready for a summit . He wanted to understand the parts before he looked further at the whole . The spokes support the wheel , sir . I was to report how strong they were  --  how strong they appeared to me . " " Oh , yes , your client . Who is he , Mr. Converse ? " " I 'm sure General Bertholdier told you I 'm not at liberty to say . " " You were in San Francisco , California ? " " Where a great deal of my research was done , " interrupted Joel . " It 's not where my client lives . Although I readily admit there 's a man in San Francisco  --  Palo Alto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to be my client . " " Yes , yes , I see . " Leifhelm put the ends of his fingers together as he continued , " Am I to understand that you reject the conference here in Bonn ? " Converse had taken a thousand such questions in opening gambits with attorneys seeking accommodations between corporate adversaries . Both parties wanted the same thing ; it was simply a question of flattening out the responsibility so that no one party would be the petitioner . " Well , you 've gone to a lot of trouble , " Joel began . " And as long as it 's understood that I have the option of speaking to each man individually should I wish to do so , I ca n't see any harm . " Converse permitted himself a strained smile , as he had done a thousand times . " In the interests of my client , of course . " " Of course , " said the German . " Tomorrow  --  say , four o'clock in the afternoon . I 'll send a car for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " " A table ? " " Dinner , naturally . After we have our talk . " Ieifhelm rose from the chair " I would n't think of your coming to Bonn and forgoing the experience I 'm known for my dinner parties , Mr. Converse . And if it concerns  | you , make whatever  --  security arrangements you like . A platoon of personal guards , if you wish . You 'll be perfectly safe . Mein Haus ist dein Haus . " " I do n't speak German . " " Actually , it 's an old Spanish saying . Mi casa , su casa . My house is your house . ' Your comfort and well-being are my most urgent concerns . " " Mine , too , " said Joel , rising . " I would n't think of having anyone accompany me , or follow me . It 'd be counterproductive . Of course , I 'll inform my client as to my whereabouts , telling him approximately when he can expect my subsequent call . He 'll be anxious to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leifhelm and Converse walked to the door ; the German turned and once more offered his hand . " Until tomorrow , then . And may I again suggest while you 're here that you be careful , at least for several days . " " I understand . " The puppets in New York . The killing that had to be dealt with  --  the first of two obstacles , two sharp , sickening aches in his chest . " By the way , " said Joel , releasing the field marshal 's hand . " There was a news item on the BBC this morning that interested me  --  so much that I phoned an associate . A man was killed in New York , a judge . They say it was a revenge killing , a contract put out by organized crime . Did you happen to hear anything about it ? " " I ? " asked Leifhelm , his blond-white eyebrows raised , his waxlike lips parted . " It seems people are killed by the dozens every day in New York , judges included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? The answer , obviously , is no . " " I just wondered . Thank you . " " But . . . but you . You must have a ... " " Yes , General ? " " Why does this judge interest you ? Why did you think I would know him ? " Converse smiled , but without a trace of humor . " I wo n't be telling you anything when I tell you he was our mutual adversary  --  enemy , if you like . " " Our ? You really must explain yourself ! " " As you  --  and as I  --  said , I am what I want people to think I am . This man knew the truth . I 'm on leave of absence from my firm , working confidentially for a personal client . He tried to stop me , tried to get the senior partner to cancel my leave and call me back . " " By giving him reasons ? " " No , just veiled threats of corruption and impropriety . He would n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't back it up ; his own conduct would be suspect . My employer is completely ignorant  --  angry as hell and confused  --  but I 've calmed him down . It 's a closed issue ; the less it 's explored , the better for us all . " Joel opened the door for Leifhelm . " Till tomorrow ? " He paused for a brief moment , loathing the man standing in front of him but showing only respect in his eyes . " Field Marshal , " he added . " cute Nacht , " said Erich Leifhelm , nodding his head sharply once in military acknowledgment . Converse persuaded the switchboard operator to send someone into the dining room for the American , Commander Fitzpatrick . The task of finding the naval officer was not easy , for he was not in the dining room or the bar but outside on the Spanische Terrasse having a drink with friends , watching the Rhine at twilight . " What goddamned friends ? " demanded Joel over the phone . " just a couple I met out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pretty much into his seventies , I think . " " And she ? " asked Converse , his lawyer 's antenna struck by a signal . " Maybe  --  thirty , forty years younger , " replied Connal with less elaboration . " Get up here , sailor ! " Fitzpatrick leaned forward on the couch , his elbows on his knees , his expression a mixture of concern and astonishment as he looked over at Joel , who was smoking a cigarette in front of the open balcony doors . " Let me run this again , " he said warily . " You want me to stop someone from getting your service record ? " " Not all of it , just part of it . " " Who the hell do you think I am ? " " You did it for Avery  --  for Press . You can do it for me . You have to ! " " That 's backwards . I opened those files for him , I did n't keep them closed . " " Either way it 's control . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm here , not there . I ca n't scissor something out you do n't like ten thousand miles away . Be reasonable ! " " Somebody can , somebody has to ! It 's only a short segment , and it 's got to be at the end . The final interview . " " An interview. ? " said Connal , startled , getting to his feet . " In a service record ' You mean Some kind of operational report ? Because if you do , it would n't he  --  - "  | " Not a report , " interrupted Converse , shaking his head . " The discharge  --  my discharge interview . That stuff Press Halliday quoted to me . " " Wait a minute , wait a minute ! " Fitzpatrick held up his hands . " Are you referring to the remarks made at your discharge hearing ? " " Yes , that 's it . The hearing ! " " Well , relax . They 're not part of your service record , or anyone else 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just told you , he quoted my words verbatim ! " Joel walked to a table where there was an ashtray ; he crushed out his cigarette . " If they 're not part of the record , how did he get them ? How did you get them for him ? " " That 's different , " said Connal , obviously remembering as he spoke . " You were a POW , and a lot of those hearings were put under a debriefing classification , and I do mean classified . Even after all these years , many of those sessions are still touchy . A lot of things were talked about that no one to this day wants made public  --  for everyone 's good , not just the military 's . " " But you got them ! I heard my own words , goddamn it ! " " Yes , I got them , " admitted the Navy lawyer without enthusiasm . " I got the transcript , and I 'd be busted to seaman third class if anyone knew about it . You see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , needed everything . He could n't make any mistakes . " " How did you do it ? You were n't even in San Diego at the time , that 's what you said ! " " By calling the vaults and using my legal-release number to have a photostat made . I said it was a Four Zero emergency and I 'd take responsibility . The next morning when the authorization came in by pouch for countersignature , I had the chief legal officer at the base sign it with a lot of other things . It simply got buried in the paper work . " " But how did you know about it in the first place ? " " Selected POW records have flags on their discharge sheets . " " Clarification , please ? " " Just what I said , flags . Small blue seals that denote additional information still held under tight security . No flags , everything 's clean ; but if there is one , that means there 's something else . I told Press , and he said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Then anyone else could , too . " " No , not anyone . You need an officer with a legal-release number , and there are n't that many of us . Also there 's a minimum forty-eight-hour delay so the material can be vetted . That 's almost always in the area of weapons and technology data that still might be classified . " " Forty-eight ? " Converse swallowed as he tried to count the hours since  | Paris , since the first moment his name had surfaced . " There 's still time ! " he said , his voice taut , his words clipped . " If you can do it there 's still time . And if you can , I 'll tell you everything I know because you 'll deserve it . No one will deserve it more . " " Spell it out . " Joel turned aimlessly , shaking his head . " That 's funny . I said the same thing to Avery . I said Spell it out , Avery . ' . . . Sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy lawyer , a military lawyer with a mystifying military privilege called a legal-release number . " Listen to me and hear me clearly . A few minutes ago something happened that I was n't sure would or could happen  --  something your brother-in-law was killed to prevent . Tomorrow at four o'clock in the afternoon I 'm going to walk into the midst of that group of men who 've come together to promote a kind of violence that 'll stun this world , toppling governments , allowing these same men to step in and fill the voids . They 'll run things their way , shape the laws their way . One big Supreme Court , each chair owned by a fanatic with specific convictions as to who and what has value and who and what does n't , and those who do n't can go to hell , no appeals on the agenda . ... I 'm going to meet them face-to-face ! I 'm going to talk with them , hear their words ! I admit I 'm the most amateurish fox you 've ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case it 's a vultures ' nest , and I mean the type that swoops down and tears the flesh off your back with one pass . But I 've got something going for me : I 'm one hell of a good lawyer , and I 'll learn things they wo n't know I 've learned . Maybe enough to piece together a couple of cases that will blow it all apart  --  blow them apart . I told you before that I rejected your deadline . I still reject it , but now it does n't seem so out of the question . Certainly not two days , but perhaps not ten ! You see , I thought I was going to have to fly to Tel Aviv , then Johannesburg . Prime everyone , frighten them . Now I do n't have to ! We 've already done it ! They 're coming to me because they 're the ones who are frightened now ! They do n't know what to think , and that means they 've panicked . " Converse paused , sweat forming on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tell you what a good lawyer can do with panicked hostile witnesses . The materials he can collect for evidence . " " Your plea 's accepted , counselor , " said Fitzpatrick , not without awe . " You 're convincing . Now , tell me why my intercession can help ? What does it accomplish ? " " I want those men to think I 'm one of them ! I can live with everything they can put together about me  --  I'in not proud of it all ; I 've made my compromises  --  hut I ca n't live with that transcript of my discharge ! Do n't you sew ' It 's what Avery Press  --  undcrstrxxl ! I understand now . Ilc  | knew me nearly twenty-five years ago , and when I think back we were actually pretty damned good friends . And no matter what happened to us individually , he was banking on the fact that I had n't really changed that much , not in the deeper things . By the time we reach the voting age we 're pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come later , much later , dictated by such things as acceptance or rejection and the state of our wallets  --  the prices we pay for our convictions , or to support our talents , defending success or explaining failure . That transcript confirmed what Halliday believed , at least enough to make him want to meet me , talk with me , and finally to recruit me . Only , he did it  --  finally  --  by dying as I held his head . I could n't walk away after that . " Connal Fitzpatrick was silent as he walked out on the balcony . He leaned over and gripped the railing as Converse watched him . Then he stood up , raised both his hands , and pulled back the sleeve of his left wrist . " It 's twelve-fifteen in San Diego . No one in legal goes to lunch before one o'clock ; the Coronado 's bar does n't begin to jump until then . " " Can you do it ? " " I can try , " said the naval officer , crossing through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if you 've got your times straight , I s can do better than try , I can issue an order . That 's what rank 's all about . " The first five minutes were excruciating for Joel . There were delays on all overseas calls , but somehow the bi- , tri- , or quadri-lingual Fitzpatrick , speaking urgently , unctuously , in German , managed to get through , the word dringend repeated frequently . " Lieutenant Senior Grade Remington , David . Legal Division , SAND PAC . This is an emergency , sailor , Commander Fitzpatrick calling . Break in if the lines are occupied . " Connal covered the mouthpiece and turned to Converse . " If you 'll open my suitcase , there 's a bottle of bourbon in the middle . " " I 'll open your suitcase , Commander . " " Remington ? ... Hello , David , it 's Connal . . . . Yes , thanks very much , I 'll tell Meagen .... No , I 'm not in San Francisco , do n't call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to handle , something on my calendar that I did n't get to . For openers , it 's a Four Zero emergency . I 'll fill you in when I get back , but until I do you have to take care of it . Got a pencil ? ... There 's a POW service record under the name of Converse , Joel , I , ieutenant , one and a half stripes , Air Arm , pilot  --  carrier-based , Vietnam duty . He was discharged in the sixties " ? Fitzpatrick looked down at Converse , who held up his right hand and three fingers of his left ? " nineteen sixty-eight , to be exact . " Joel stepped forward , his spread right hand still raised , his left now showing only the index finger . " June of ' 68 , "  | added the Navy lawyer , nodding . " Point of separation our old hometown , San Diego . Have you got all that ? Read it back to me , please , David . " Connal nodded sporadically , as he listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . June , ' 68 , Air Arm , pilot , Vietnam , POW section , San Diego separation ; that 's it , you 've got it . Now here 's the wicket , David . This Converse 's SR is flag status ; the flag pertains to his discharge hearing , no weapons or high tech involved . . . . Listen carefully , David . It 's my understanding that there may be a request pending accompanied by a legal-release code for the discharge transcript . Under no circumstances is that transcript to be released . The flag stays fixed and ca n't be removed by anyone without my authorization . And if the release has been processed it 'll still be within the forty-eight-hour vet-delay . Kill it . Under-stood ? " Again Fitzpatrick listened , but instead of nodding , he shook his head . " No , not under any circumstances . I do n't care if the secretaries of State , Defense , and the Navy all sign a joint petition on White House stationery , the answer is no . If anyone questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Chief Legal Officer of SAND PAC . There 's some goddamned article in the shoals ' that says a station CLO can impound materials on the basis of conceivably privileged information relative to the security of the sector , et cetera , et cetera . I do n't recall the time element ? seventy-two hours or five days or something like that  --  but find that statute . You may need it . " Connal listened further , his brows creasing , his eyes straying to Joel . He spoke slowly as Converse felt the sickening ache again in his chest . " Where can you reach me . . . ? " said the naval officer , perplexed . Then suddenly he was no longer bewildered . " I take back what I said before ; call Meagen in San Francisco . If I 'm not with her and the kids , she 'll know where to reach me . . . . Thanks again , David . Sweep your decks and get right on this , okay ? Thanks . . . I 'll tell Meg . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , " he said , slouched in relief , pushing his hand through his loose light-brown hair . " I 'll phone Meagen and give her this number , tell her to say I 've gone up to the Sonoma hills , if Remington calls  --  Press had some property there . " " Give her the telephone number , " said Joel , " but do n't tell her anything else . " " Do n't worry , she 's got enough on her mind . " The naval officer looked at Converse , frowning . " If your hourly count is right , you 've got your time now . " " My count 's all right . Is Lieutenant Remington ? I mean that only in the sense that he would n't let anyone override your order , would he ? "  | " Do n't mistake my officiousness where he 's concerned , " replied Connal . " David is n't easily pushed around . The reason I chose him and not one of the four other senior lawyers in the department is that he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find that statute and nail it to the forehead of any four-striper who tries to countermand that order . I like Remington ; he 's very useful . He scares the hell out of people . " " We all have case partners like that . It 's called the good guy  --  bad guy routine . " " David fits . He 's got an eye that keeps straying to the right . " Fitzpatrick suddenly stood erect , his bearing military . " I thought you were going to get the bourbon , Lieutenant ? " " Yes , sir , Commander ! " shot back Joel , heading for Fitzpatrick 's suitcase . " And if I remember correctly , after you pour us a drink , you 're going to tell me a story I want very much to hear . " " Aye , aye , sir ! " said Converse , lifting the suitcase off the floor and putting it on the couch . " And if I may suggest , sir , " continued Joel , " a room-service dinner might be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trying day at the wheel . " " Good thinking , Lieutenant . I 'll phone down to the Emp fang . " " Before calling your bookie , may I also suggest that you first call your sister ? " " Oh , Christ , I forgot ! " Chaim Abrahms walked down the dark street in Tel Aviv , his stocky frame draped in his usual safari jacket , boots beneath his khaki trousers , and a beret covering his nearly bald head . The beret was the only concession he made to the night 's purpose ; normally he enjoyed being recognized , accepting the adulation with well-rehearsed humility . In daylight , his head uncovered and held erect , and wearing his familiar jacket , he would acknowledge the homage with a nod , his eyes boring in on his followers . " First a Jew ! " was the phrase with which he was always greeted , whether in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem , in sections of Paris and most of New York . The phrase had been born years ago when as a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in absentia by the British for the slaughter of a Palestinian village , with the Arab corpses put on display for Nakama ! He had then issued a cry heard around the world : " I am first a Jew , a son of Abraham ! All else follows , and rivers of blood will follow if the children of Abraham are denied ! " The British , in 1948 , not caring to create another martyr , commuted  | his sentence and gave him a large moshay . Yet the acreage of the settlement could not confine the militant sabra . Three wars had broken his agricultural shackles as well as unleashing his ferocity  --  and his brilliance in the field . It was a brilliance developed and refined through the early years of racing with a fugitive , fragmented army , for which the tactics of surprise , shock , hit and melt away were constant , when being outmanned and outgunned were the accepted odds but only victory was the acceptable outcome . He later applied the strategies and the philosophy of those years to the ever-expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force of a mighty Israel . Mars was in the heavens of Chaim Abrahm 's vision and , the prophets aside , the god of war was his strength , his reason for being . From Ramat Aviv to Har Hazeytim , from Rehovot to Masada of the Negev , Nakama ! was the cry . Retribution to the enemies of Abraham 's children ! If only the Poles and the Czechs , the Hungarians and the Romanies , as well as the haughty Germans and the impossible Russians , had not immigrated to his country by such tens of thousands . They arrived and the complications came with them . Faction against faction , culture against culture , each group trying to prove it was more entitled to the name Jew than the others . It was all nonsense ! They were there because they had to be ; they had succumbed to Abraham 's enemies , permitted ? yes , permitted  --  the slaughter of millions rather than rising as millions and slaughtering in return . Well , they found out what their civilized ways could bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So they came to the Holy Land  --  their Holy Land , so they proclaimed . Well , it was n't theirs . Where were they when it was being clawed out of rock and arid desert by strong hands with primitive tools ? Biblical tools ? Where were they when the hated Arab and the despised English first felt the wrath of the tribal Jew ? They were in the capitals of Europe , in their banks and their fancy drawing rooms , making money and drinking expensive brandy out of crystal goblets . No , they came here because they had to ; they came to the Holy Land of the sabra . They brought with them money and dandy ways and elegant words and confusing arguments and influence and the guilt of the world . But it was the sabra who taught them how to fight . And it was a sabra who would bring all Israel into the orbit of a mighty new alliance . Abrahms reached the intersection of Ibn Gabirol and Arlosoroff streets ; the strcetlamps were haloed , their light hazy . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I le had another block to go , to an address on Jabotinsky , an unprepossessing apartment house where there was an undistinguished flat leased by a man who appeared to . be no more than an unimportant  | bureaucrat . What few realized , however , was that this man , this specialist who operated sophisticated computer equipment with communications throughout most of the world , was intrinsic to the global operations of the Mossad , Israel 's intelligence service , which many considered the finest on earth . He , too , was a sabra . He was one of them . Abrahms spoke his name quietly into the mouthpiece above the mail slot in the outer lobby ; he heard the click in the lock of the heavy door and walked inside . He began the climb up the three flights of steps that would take him to the flat . " Some wine , Chaim ? " " Whisky , " was the curt reply . " Always the same question and always the same answer , " said the specialist . " I say Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whisky , ' you say . You would drink whisky at the Seder , if you could get away with it . " I can and I do . " Abrahms sat in a cracked leather chair , looking around the plain , disheveled room with books everywhere , wondering , as he always did , whi a man with such influence lived this way . It was rumored that the Mossad officer did not like company , and larger , more attractive quarters might invite it . " I gathered from your grunts and coughs over the telephone that you have what I need . " " Yes , I have it , " said the specialist , bringing a glass of very good Scotch to his guest . " I have it , but I do n't think you 're going to like it . " " Why not ? " asked Abrahms , drinking , his eyes alert over the rim of the glass and fixed on his host as the latter sat down opposite him . " Basically because it 's confusing , and what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are not a delicate man , Chaim Abrahms , forgive the indelicacy of my saying it . You tell me this Converse is your enemy , a would-be infiltrator , and I tell you I find nothing to support the conclusion . Before anything else , there must be a deep personal motive for a nonprofessional to engage in this kind of deception , this kind of behavior , if you will . There has to be a driving compulsion to strike out at an image of a cause he loathes . Well , there is a motive , and there is an enemy for which he must have great hatred , but neither is compatible with what you suggest . The information , incidentally , is completely reliable . It comes from the Quang Dinh ? " " What in hell is that ? " interrupted the general . " A specialized branch of North Vietnamese  --  now , of course , Vietnamese  --  intelligence . " " You have sources there ? "  | " We fed them for years  --  nothing terribly vital , but sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we had to know , weapons we had to understand ; they could be turned against us . " " This Converse was in North Vietnam ? " " For several years as a prisoner of war ; there 's an extensive file on him . At first , his captors thought he could be used for propaganda , radio broadcasts , television  --  imploring his brutal government to withdraw and stop the bombing , all the usual garbage . He spoke well , presented a good picture , and was obviously very American . Initially they televised him as a murderer from the skies , saved from the angry mobs by humane troops , then later while eating and exercising ; you see , they were programming him for a violently sudden reversal . They thought he was a soft , privileged young man who could be broken rather easily to do their bidding in exchange for more comfortable treatment  --  after having experienced a period of harsh deprivation . What they learned , however , was quite different . Under that soft shell the inner lining was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the months went by it grew harder , until they realized they had created  --  created was their word  --  a hellhound of sorts , somehow forged in steel . " " Hellhound ? Was that their word , too ? " " No , they called him an ugly troublemaker , which , considering the source , is not without irony . The point is , they recognized the fact that they had created him . The harsher the treatment , the more volatile he became , the more resilient . " " Why not ? " said Abrahms sharply . " He was angry . Prod a desert snake and watch him strike . " " I can assure you , Chaim , it is not the normal human response under such conditions . A man can go mad and strike in crazed fury , or he can become reclusive to the point of catatonia , or fall apart weeping , willing to compromise anything and everything for the smallest kindness . He did none of these things . His was a calculated and inventive series of responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led two escapes  --  the first lasting three days and the second five  --  before the groups were recaptured . As the leader , he was placed in a cage in the Mekong River , but he devised a way to kill the water rats by grabbing them from beneath the surface like a shark . He was then thrown into solitary confinement , a pit in the ground twelve feet deep with barbed wire anchored across the top . It was from there , during a heavy rainstorm at night , that he clawed his wa up , bent the wire hack and escaped alone . He made his way south *  | " Why did n't they simply kill him before that ? " " I wondered myself , " said the specialist , " so I phoned my source in Hanoi , the one who provided the information . He said a strange thing , something quite profound in its way . He said he was n't there , of course , but he thought it was probably respect . " " For an ugly troublemaker ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both the captured and the captors . There are so many factors at work in a vicious game . Aggression , resistance , bravery , fear , and  --  not the least  --  curiosity , especially when the players come from such diverse cultures as the Occident and the Orient . An abnormal bond is often formed , as much from the weariness of the testing game as from anything else , perhaps . It does n't lessen the national animosities , but a subtle recognition sets in that tells these men , these players , that they are not really in the game by their own choosing . In-depth analyses further show us that it is the captors , not the captured , who first perceive this commonality . The latter are obsessed with freedom and survival , while the former begin to question their absolute authority over the lives and conditions of other men . They start to wonder what it would be like to be in the other player 's shoes . It 's all part of what the psychiatrists call the Stockholm syndrome . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? You sound like one of those bores in the Knesset reading a position paper . A little of this , a little of that and a lot of wind ! " " You are definitely not delicate , Chaim . I 'm trying to explain to you that while this Converse nurtured his hatreds and his obsessions , his captors wearied of the game , and as our source in Hanoi suggests , they grudgingly spared his life out of respect , before he made his final and successful escape . " To Abrahm 's bewilderment the specialist had apparently finished . " And ? " said the Sabra . " Well , there it is . There is the motive and the enemy , but they are also your motive and your enemy  --  arrived at from different routes , of course . Ultimately , you wish to smash insurgence wherever it erupts , curb the spread of Third World revolutions , especially Islamic , because you know they 're being fostered by the Marxists  --  read Soviets  --  and are a direct threat to Israel . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought you all together , and in my judgment rightfully so . There is a time and a place for a military-industrial complex , and it is now . It must run the governments of the free world before that world is buried by its enemies . " Chaim Abrahms squinted and tried not to shout . " And ? " " Ca n't you see ? This Converse is one of you . Everything supports it . Ile has the motive and an enemy he 's seen in the harshest light . Ile is  | a highly regarded attorney who makes a great deal of money with a very conservative firm , and his clients are among the wealthiest corporations and conglomerates . Everything he 's been and everything he stands for can only benefit from your efforts . The confusion lies in his unorthodox methods , and I ca n't explain them except to say that perhaps they are not unorthodox in the specialized work he does . Markets can plummet on rumors ; concealment and diversion are surely respected . Regardless , he does n't want to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabra put his glass down on the floor and struggled out of the chair . With his chin tucked into his breastbone and his hands clasped behind his back , Abrahms paced back and forth in silence . He stopped and looked down at the specialist . " Suppose , just suppose , " he said , " the almighty Mossad has made a mistake , that there 's something you did n't find . " " I would find that hard to accept . " " But it 's a possibility ! " " In light of the information we 've gathered , I doubt it . Why ? " " Because I have a sense of smell , that 's why ! " The man from the Mossad kept his eyes on Abrahms , as if studying the soldier 's face  --  or thinking from a different viewpoint . " There is only one other possibility , Chaim . If this Converse is not who and what I 've described , which would be contrary to all the data we 've compiled , then he is an agent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell , " said the sabra softly . It was the specialist 's turn to be silent . He breathed deeply , then responded . " I respect your nostrils , old friend . Not always your conduct but certainly your sense of smell . What do the others think ? " " Only that he 's lying , that he 's covering for others he may or may not know , who are using him as a scout  --  an infantry point ' was the term used by Palo Alto . " The Mossad officer continued to stare at the sabra , but his eyes were no longer focused ; he was seeing abstract , twisted patterns , convolutions few men would comprehend . They came from a lifetime of analyzing seen and unseen , legitimate and racial enemies , parrying dagger thrusts with counterthrusts in the blackest darkness . " It 's possible , " he whispered , as if replying to an unspoken question heard only by himself . " Almost inconceivable , but possible . " " W hat is ? Mat Washington is behind him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not subscribe to , but the only one  | left that has the slightest plausibility . Simply put , he has too much information . " " And ? " " Not Washington in the usual sense , not the government in the broader sense , but within a branch of the government a section that has heard whispers about an organization but can not be sure . They believe that if there is such an organization , they must invade it to expose it . So they choose a man with the right history , the right memories , even the right profession to do the job . He might even believe everything he says . " The sabra was transfixed but impatient . " That has too many complications for me , " he said bluntly . " Try it my way first . Try to accept him ; he may be genuine . He 'll have to give you something concrete ; you can force that . Then again he may not because he can not . " " And ? " And if he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put as much distance between him and his sponsors as is humanly and brutally possible . He must become a pariah , a man hunted for crimes so insane his madness is unquestioned . " " Why not just kill him ? " " By all means , but not before he 's been labeled so mad that no one will step forward to claim him . It will buy you the time you need . The final phase of Aquitaine is when ? Three , four weeks away ? " " That 's when it begins , yes . " The specialist got up from the chair and stood pensively in front of the soldier . " I repeat , first try to accept him , see if what I said before is true . But if that sense of smell of yours is provoked further , if there 's the slightest possibility he has been willingly or unwillingly , wittingly or unwittingly , made a provocateur by men in Washington , then build your case against him and throw him to the wolves . Create that pariah as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before anyone else reaches him . " " A sabra of the Mossad speaks ? " " As clearly as I can . " The young Army captain and the older civilian came out of the Pentagon from adjacent glass doors and glanced briefly at each other with no recognition . They walked separately down the short bank of steps and turned left on the cement path that led to the enormous parking lot ; the Army officer was perhaps ten feet ahead of the civilian . Upon reaching the huge asphalt area , each veered in a different direction toward his car .  | If these two men had been the subjects of photographic surveillance during the past fifty seconds , there was no indication whatsoever that they knew each other . The green Buick coupe turned right in the middle of the block , going through the open chasm that was the entrance to the hotel 's underground parking lot . At the bottom of the ramp the driver showed his room key to the attendant , who raised the yellow barrier and waved him along . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles . The Buick eased into it and the Army captain got out . He circled through the revolving door and walked to a bank of elevators in the hotel 's lower lobby . The panels of the second elevator opened , revealing two couples who had not intended to reach the underground level ; they laughed as one of the men repeatedly pressed the lobby button . The officer , in turn , touched the button for the fourteenth floor . Sixty seconds later he walked out into the corridor toward the exit staircase . He was heading for the eleventh floor . The blue Toyota station wagon came down the ramp , the driver 's hand extended , a room key held out , the number visible . Inside the parking area the driver found an empty space and carefully steered the small station wagon into it . The civilian stepped out and looked at his watch . Satisfied , he started toward the revolving door and the elevators . The second elevator was empty , and the civilian was tempted to press the button for the eleventh floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the additional walk However , there would be other occupants on the way up , so he held to the rules and placed his index finger over the button beside tllc number 9 . Standing in front of the hotel-room door , the civilian raised his hand , rapped once , waited several beats , then rapped twice more . Seconds later the door was opened by the Army captain . Beyond him was a third man , also in uniform , the color and the insignia denoting a lieutenant , junior grade , in the Navy . He stood by a desk with a telephone on it . " Glad you got here on time , " said the Army officer . " The traffic was rotten . Our call should be coming through in a few minutes . " The civilian entered , nodding to the Navy man as he spoke . " What did you find out about Fitzpatrick ? " he asked . " I Ic 's where he should n't he , " replied the lieutenant . " Can you bring hint back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know where to begin . I 'm a very low man on a very big totem pole . " " Are n't we all ? " said the captain . " Who 'd have thought Halliday would have gone to him ? " asked the naval officer , frustration in his voice . " Or if he was going to bring him in , why did n't he go to him first ? Or tell him about us ? " " I can answer the last two questions , " said the Army man . " He was protecting him from a Pentagon backlash . If we go down , his brother-inlaw stays clean . " " And I can answer the first question , " said the civilian . " Halliday went to Fitzpatrick because in the final analysis , he did n't trust us . Geneva proved he was right . " " How ? " asked the captain defensively , but without apology . " We could n't have prevented it . " " No , we could n't , " agreed the civilian . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . That was part of the trust , and there was no way we could live up to it . We could n't afford to . " The telephone rang . The lieutenant picked it up and listened . " It 's Mykonos , " he said .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | " Press knew I had dealings with those committees , with the technology and armaments boys ! He even asked me about them . Who I saw , who I liked  --  who I trusted . Jesus ! Why did n't he come to me ? Of all the people he knew , I was the logical one ! I 'm down the pike and his closest friend . " " That 's why he did n't come to you , " said Converse . " Stupid bastard ! " Connal raised his eyes . " And I hope you hear that , Press .

" There 's more faith in honest doubt than is held by all the archangels in the mind of God . ' " " It 's very nice . I 've never heard it before . " " Maybe I did n't get it right . . . . Joel , I 've got to see those names ! " " And I have to get my attache case , but I ca n't go myself . " " Then I 'm elected , " said the Navy man . " Do you think Leifhelm 's right ?

If I see the same pair of headlights twice , I 'll go to a Bierkeller . I know a few here . " Joel looked at his watch . " It 's twenty minutes to ten .

" " No , just recognition . I know where you 're coming from . I 've been there . " Fitzpatrick walked slowly along the wide path on the south facade of the immense university building , once the great palace of the all-powerful archbishops of Cologne . The unimpeded moonlight swelled over the area , reflecting off the myriad rows of cathedral windows and lending a luminous dimension to the light stone walls of the majestic structure . Beyond the path the winding gardens of August possessed an eerie elegance ? circles of sleeping flowers , their beauty heightened by the moonlight . Connal was so struck by the tranquil loveliness of the nocturnal setting that he nearly forgot why he was there . The reason was brought sharply back into focus when he saw a slender figure slouched alone on a bench . The man 's legs were extended and crossed at the ankles , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently to hide the flowing gray-blond hair that protruded slightly over his temples and the back of his neck . So this Caleb Dowling was an actor , thought the Navy lawyer , amused by the fact that Dowling had feigned shock when he realized Connal did not recognize him . But then , neither had Converse ; they were obviously a minority in a world of television addicts . A college professor who had fulfilled the fantasies of youth , a risk-taker , according to Joel , who had won a battle against astronomical odds , was a nice thing to think about ; the only sad note was the haunted life of his wife , whom he loved dearly . Also , a marine who had fought in the bloody mess that was Kwajalein was a man to be reckoned with . Fitzpatrick walked over to the bench and sat down several feet away from Dowling . The actor glanced at him , then did a perfectly natural double take , his head snapping . " You ? " " I 'm sorry about last night , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You lacked a certain finish , young fella . Where the hell is Converse ? " " Sorry again . He could n't make it , but not to worry . Everything 's A-okay and under control . " " Whose okay and whose control ? " countered the actor , annoyed . " I told Joel to come here , not a cub-scout interlocutor . " " I resent that . I 'm a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy and the chief legal officer at a major naval base . Mr. Converse accepted an assignment from us which has an element of personal risk for him and the highest priority of classification for us . Back off , Mr. Dowling . We appreciate  --  and I speak for Converse as well as myself  --  your interest and  | your generosity , but it 's time for you to recede . For your own benefit , incidentally . " " What about Interpol ? He killed a man . " " Who tried to kill him , " added Fitzpatrick quickly , a lawyer rejoining a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be clarified internally and the charges dropped . " " You 're pretty smooth , Commander , " said Dowling , sitting up . " Better than you were last night  --  this morning , actually . " " I was upset . I 'd lost him and I had to find him . I had to deliver vital information . " The actor now crossed his legs at the knees and leaned back , his arm slung casually over the slatted rim of the bench . " So this thing Converse and you are involved with is a real hush-hush operation ? " " It 's highly classified , yes . " " And you and he being lawyers , it 's got something to do with legal irregularities over here that somehow reach into the military , is that right ? " " In the broadest sense , again yes . I 'm afraid I ca n't be any more specific . Converse mentioned that there was someone you wanted him to meet . " " Yes , there is . I said a couple of harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was doing his thing . He did n't know who the hell I was any more than you did . He 's one smart man , tough but fair . " " I hope you understand that under the circumstances Converse ca n't comply with your request . " " You 'll do , " said Dowling calmly , removing his arm from the back of the bench . Connal was suddenly alarmed . There was movement behind him in the shadowed moonlight ; he whipped his head around , peering over his shoulder . Out of the protective darkness of the building from within the pitch-black cover of a doorway the figure of a man began walking across the dark green lawn . An arm thrown casually over the rim of the bench , then just as casually removed . Both movements had been signals ! Identity confirmed ; move in . " What the hell have you done ? " asked the Navy lawyer harshly . " Bringing you two bucks to your senses , " replied Dowling . " If my celebrated instincts are valid , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still did the right thing . " " What ? " The man crossing the lawn entered the spill of clear moonlight . He was heavyset and wore a dark suit and tie ; his scowling , late-middle-aged face  | and straight gray hair gave him the air of a prosperous businessman . It was clear that at the moment he was intensely angry . Dowling spoke as he got up from the bench . " Commander , may I introduce the Honorable Walter Peregrine , United States ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany . " Lieutenant David Remington wiped his steel-rimmed glasses with a silicone-treated tissue , then threw the tissue into a wastebasket and got up from his desk . Returning the glasses to his face , he walked to a mirror secured to the back of his office door and checked his appearance . He smoothed his hair , shoved the knot of his tie in place , and looked down at the failing crease of his trousers . All things considered  --  it was 1730 hours and he had been harassed at his desk since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency from Fitzpatrick  --  he looked quite presentable . And anyway , Rear Admiral Hickman was not a stickler for spit and polish where the desk corps was concerned . He knew damn well that most of the legal execs would bolt in a minute for much higher paying jobs in the civilian sector if the dress and other disposable codes were taken too seriously . Well , David Remington would n't . Where the hell else could a man travel all over the world , housing a wife and three kids in some of the nicest quarters imaginable , with all the medical and dental bills paid for , and not have the terrible pressures of rising in private or corporate practice . His father had been an attorney for one of the biggest insurance companies in Hartford , Connecticut , and his father had had ulcers at forty-three , a nervous breakdown at forty-eight , his first stroke at fifty-one , and a final , massive coronary at fifty-six ; everyone had said he was so terrific at his job he might even be in line for the presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man died in the line of corporate duty  --  which men did too goddamned frequently . None of that for David Remington , no sir ! He was simply going to be one of the best lawyers in the U.S. Navy , serve his thirty years , get out at fifty-five with a generous pension , and become a well-paid legal-military consultant at fifty-six . At the precise age when his father died , he would start living very nicely , indeed . It was simply a matter of building a reputation as a man who knew more about naval and maritime law  --  and who stuck to it  --  than any other lawyer in the Navy . If he stepped on toes in his performance , so be it ; it could only enhance that reputation . He did n't give a damn about being popular ; he cared only about being right . And he never made a decision until he was certain of its correct legal position . Consultants like that were prized commodities in civilian practice .  | Remington wondered why Admiral Hickman wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk corps had gone for the day . There was a court-martial pending that could become a sensitive issue . A black officer , an Annapolis graduate , had been caught selling cocaine off a destroyer berthed in the Philippines ; that was probably it . Remington had pre-prepared the case for the judge advocate , who frankly did not care to prosecute ; the amount was not that large , and others were certainly selling far more , and they were probably white . That was not the point , Remington had insisted . If there were others , they had not been caught ; if there was evidence , it had not been found . The law was color-blind . He would say the same thing to Hickman . The " stickler prick , " a derisive nickname Remington knew was used behind his back , would stand firm . Well , at fifty-six  --  the age at which his father had been killed by company policy  --  a stickler prick would have all the comforts of an exclusive country club without paying the corporate price . Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway , and started for the elevator that would take him to the office of the highest ranking man at the San Diego naval base . " Sit down , Remington , " said Rear Admiral Brian Hickman , shaking the lieutenant 's hand and indicating a chair in front of the large desk . " I do n't know about you , but this has been what I used to call at your age one fucked-up day . Sometimes I wish Congress would n't appropriate so damn much money down here . Everyone gets on such a high you 'd think they 'd smoked everything in Tijuana . They forget they 're supposed to have architects before they start bribing the contractors . " " Yes , sir , I know what you mean , sir , " said Remington , sitting down with proper deference as Hickman stood several feet to his left . The mere reference to Tijuana and drugs confirmed his suspicions ; the admiral was about to launch into the everybody-does-it routine , which would lead to " Why should the Navy stir up a racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , he was prepared . The law  --  naval law  --  was color-blind . " I 'm going to have a well-deserved drink , Lieutenant , " said Hickman , heading for a copper dry bar against the wall . " Can I get you something ? " " No , thank you , sir . " " Hey , look , Remington , I appreciate your staying late for this  --  conference , I guess you 'd call it , but I do n't expect any version of corporate military behavior . Frankly , I 'd feel foolish drinking by myself , and what we 've got to talk about is n't so alniighty important . I just want to ask you a couple of questions . " " Corporate behavior , sir ? I 'll have some white wine , if you have it , sir . "  | " I always have it , " said the admiral with resignation . " It 's usually for personnel who are about to get divorced . " " I 'm happily married , sir . " " Glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  should have stuck with the first . " The drinks poured , the seating arrangements in order , Hickman spoke from behind the desk , his tie loosened , his voice casual . But what he said evoked anything but casualness in David Remington . " Who the hell is Joel Converse ? " asked the admiral . " I beg your pardon , sir ? " The admiral sighed , the sound indicating that be would begin again . " At twelve hundred hours , twenty-one minutes today , you placed a CLO negative on all inquiries regarding a flag on one Lieutenant Joel Converse 's service record . He was a pilot in the Vietnam action . " " I know what he was , sir , " said Remington . " And at fifteen hundred hours , two minutes , " continued Hickman , looking at a note on his desk . " I get a teletype from the Fifth Naval District requesting that the flag be removed in their favor and the material released immediately . The basis for their request was  --  as it always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip his drink ; he appeared to he in no hurry , simply weary . " I ordered my adjutant to call you and ask why you did it . " " And I answered him completely , sir , " Remington broke in . " It was at the instructions of the chief legal officer of SAND PAC , and I cited the specific regulation that states clearly that the CLO of a naval base can withhold files on the basis that his own inquiries can be compromised by the entrance of a third party . It 's standard in civil law , sir . The Federal Bureau of Investigation rarely gives a local or metropolitan police force t he information it 's collected in an investigation for the simple reason that the investigation could be compromised by leaks or corrupt practices . " " And our chief legal officer , Lieutenant Commander Fitzpatrick , is currently carrying out an investigation of an officer who left the service eighteen years ago ? " " I do n't know , sir , " said Remington , his eyes noncommittal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in force for seventy-two hours . After that , you , of course , can sign the order of release . And the President , naturally , can do so anytime in a national emergency . " " I thought it was forty-eight hours , " said Hickman . " No , sir . The forty-eight hours is standard with the release of every flag regardless of who asks for it  --  except , of course , the President . It 's called t lie vet delay . Naval intelligence cross-checks with the CIA , the NSA , and  | G-Two to make sure there 's no material being released that 's still considered classified . That procedure has nothing to do with the prerogatives of a chief legal officer . " " You know your law , do n't you ? " " I believe as well as any attorney in the United States Navy , sir . " " I see . " The admiral leaned back in his upholstered swivel chair and placed his legs on the corner of the desk . " Commander Fitzpatrick 's off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall . " " Yes , sir . He 's in San Francisco with his sister and her children . Her husband was killed in a robbery in Geneva ; the funeral 's tomorrow morning , I believe . " " Yes , I read about it . Goddamned lousy . . . . But you know where to reach him . " " I have the telephone number , yes , sir . Do you want me to call him , Admiral ? Apprise him of the Fifth Naval request . " " No , no , " said Hickman , shaking his head . " Not at a time like this . They can dry their mops at least until tomorrow afternoon . I 've got to assume they also know the regulations ; if security 's so damned jeopardized , they know where the Pentagon is  --  and the latest rumor out of Arlington is that they found out where the White House is . " The Admiral stopped , frowned , and looked over at the lieutenant . " Suppose you did n't know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , but suppose you did n't ? And a legitimate request was received ? below presidential involvement , but still pretty damned urgent you could release that flag , could n't you ? " " Theoretically , as next in authority , yes I could . As long as I accepted the legal responsibility for my judgment . " " The what ? " " That I believed the request was sufficiently urgent to override the chief legal officer 's prior order , which granted him seventy-two hours for whatever action he deemed necessary . He was adamant , sir . Frankly , short of presidential intervention , I 'm legally bound to uphold the CLO 's privilege . " " I 'd say morally , too , " agreed Hickman . " Morality has nothing to do with it , sir . It 's a clear legal position . Now , shall I make that call , Admiral ? " " No , the hell with it . " Hickman removed his feet from the desk . " I was just curious and , frankly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you t he order unless he had a reason . The Fifth D can wait three days , uulc ss t hose boys want to run up telephone bills to Washington . "  | " May I ask , sir , who specifically made the request ? " The admiral looked pointedly at Remington . " I 'll tell you in three days . You see , I 've got a man 's privilege to uphold too . You 'll know then anyway , because in Fitz 's absence you 'll have to countersign the transfer . " Hickman finished his drink and the lieutenant understood . The conference was over . Remington got up and returned the half-filled wineglass to the copper bar ; he stood at attention and spoke . " Will that be all , sir ? " " Yes , that 's it , " said the admiral , his gaze straying to the window and the ocean beyond . The lieutenant saluted sharply as Hickman brought a casual hand to his forehead . The lawyer then did an about-face and started for the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lieutenant , turning . " Who the hell is this Converse ? " " I do n't know , sir . But Commander Fitzpatrick said the status of the flag was a Four Zero emergency . " " Jesus ... I lickman picked up his phone and touched a combination of buttons on t he console . Moments later he was speaking to a fellow ranking officer in the Fifth Naval District . " I 'm afraid you 'll have to wait three days , Scanlon . " " Why is that ? " asked the admiral named Scanlon . " The CLO negative holds on the Converse flag as far as SAND PAC is concerned . If you want to go the D.C. route , be my guest . We 'll cooperate . " " I told you , Brian , my people do n't want to go through Washington . You 've had these things happen before . D.C. makes waves , and we do n't want waves . " " Well then , why do n't you tell me why you want the Converse flag ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could , you know that . Frankly , I 'm not all that clear on it myself , and what I do know I 've sworn to keep secure . " " Then go to Washington , I 'm standing behind my Chief Legal , who , incidentally , is n't even here . " " He is n't ? But you talked to him . " " No , to his next in line , a lieutenant named Remington . He took the direct order from the CLO . Believe me , Remington wo n't budget . I gave hiIn the chance and he covered himself with legalities . Around here he 's known as a stickler prick. "  | " Did he say why the negative was put out ? " " He did n't have any idea . Why do n't you call him yourself ? He 's probably still downstairs and maybe you can ? " " You did n't use my name , did you ? " interrupted Scanlon , apparently agitated . " No , you asked me not to , but he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign the release and I 'll have to tell him who requested it . " Hickman paused , then without warning exploded . " What the hell is this all about , Admiral ? Some pilot who was discharged over eighteen years ago is suddenly on everybody 's most-wanted list . I get a departmental priority teletype from the big Fifth D and you follow it up with a personal call , playing the old Annapolis memory game , but you wo n't tell me anything . Then I find out my own CLO without my knowing about it has put a negative on this Converse flag and labeled it a Four Zero emergency status ! Now , I know he 's got personal problems and I wo n't bother him until tomorrow , and I realize you 've given your word to stay secure , but goddamn it , somebody had better start telling me something ! " There was no response from the other end of the line . But there was the sound of breathing ; and it was tremulous . " Scanlon ! " " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiral thirty-six hundred miles away . " I 'm going to find out anyway ? " " No , the status . The status of the flag . " Scanlon could barely be heard . " Four-Zero emergency , that 's what I said ! " The interruption was abrupt ; there was only an echoing click . Admiral Scanlon had hung up the phone . Walter Peregrine , United States ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany , confronted Fitzpatrick . " What 's your name , Commander ? " " Fowler , sir , " answered the Navy lawyer , glancing briefly but hard at Dowling . " Lieutenant Commander Avery Fowler , United States Navy . " Again Connal looked at the actor , who stared at him through the moonlight . " I understand there 's some question about that , " said Peregrine , his glare as hostile as Dowling 's . " May I see your identification , please ? " " I 'm not carrying identification , sir . It 's the nature of my assignment not to do so , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squared and erect . " I want verification of your name , your rank , and your branch of service ! Now ! "  | " The name I 've given you is the name I was instructed to give should anyone beyond the scope of the assignment inquire . " " Whose instructions ? " barked the diplomat . " My superior officers , sir . " " Am I to infer that Fowler is not your correct name ? " " With respect , Mr. Ambassador . My name is Fowler , my rank is lieutenant commander , my branch of the service is the United States Navy . " Where the hell do you think you are ? Behind the lines , captured by the enemy ? Name , rank , and serial number  --  that 's all I 'm required to say under the rules of the Geneva Convention ' ! " " It 's all I 'm permitted to say , sir . " " We 'll damn well find out about that , Commander  --  if you are a commander . Also about this Converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one minute the soul of propriety , the next a very strange man on the run . " " Please try to understand , Mr. Ambassador , our assignment is classified . In no way does it involve diplomacy , nor will it impair your efforts as the chief American representative of our government . But it is classified . I will report this convetsation to my superiors and you will undoubtedly hear from them . Now , if you gentlemen will forgive me , I 'll be on my way . " I do n't think so , Commander  --  or whoever you are . But if you are who you say , nothing 's compromised . I 'm not a damn fool . Nothing will be said to anyone on the embassy staff . Mr. Dowling insisted on that and I accepted the condition . You and I will be locked in a communications room with a phone on a scrambler and you 're going to place a call to Washington . I did n't take this job at a loss of three-quarters of a million a year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without my knowing about it . If I want an outside audit , I 'll damn well order it myself ! " " I wish I could comply , sir ; it sounds like a reasonable request . But I 'm afraid I ca n't . " " I 'm afraid you will ! " " Sorry . " " Do as he says , Commander , " interjected Dowling . " As he told you , nothing 's been said to anyone , and nothing will be . But Converse needs protection ; he 's a wanted man in a foreign country and he does n't even speak the language . Take Ambassador Peregrine 's offer . He 'll keep his word . " " With respect , sirs , the answer is negative . " Connal turned away and started up the wide path .  | " Major ! " shouted the ambassador , his voice furious . " Stop him ! Stop that man ! " Fitzpatrick looked behind him ; for reasons he could not explain to himself he saw what he never expected to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have expected it . From out of the distant shadows of the immense , majestic building a man rushed forward , a man who was obviously a military aide to the ambassador  --  a member of the embassy staff ! Connal froze , Joel 's words coming back to him . Those men you saw at the airport , the ones from the embassy . . . they 're on the other side . Under almost any other circumstances , Fitzpatrick would have remained where he was and weathered it out . He had n't actually done anything wrong ; there was nothing illegal , no laws broken of which he was cognizant , and no one could force him to discuss personal matters where no law had been violated . Then he realized how wrong he was ! The generals of George Marcus Delavane would force him , could force him ! He spun around and ran . Suddenly gunfire erupted . Two earsplitting shots above him ! He dove to the ground and rolled into the shadows of the bushes as a man 's voice roared over the stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamned son of a bitch ! What do you think you 're doing ! " There were further shouts , a further barrage of obscenities , and the sounds of struggle filled the quiet enclave of the university . " You do n't kill a man ! Besides , you bastard , there could be other people ! Do n't say a word , Mr. Ambassador ! " Connal scrambled across the graveled path and spread apart the bordering foliage . In the clear moonlight of the distant bench , the actor Caleb Dowling  --  the former marine from Kwajalein  --  stood over the body of the major who had run out of the shadow , his boot on the supine man 's throat , his hand grasping the man 's extended arm to wrench the weapon free . " You are one dumb son of a bitch , Major ! Or , goddamn you , maybe you 're something else ! " Fitzpatrick got to his knees , then to his feet , and , crouching , raced into the receding darkness of the wide path toward the exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Connal . He had dropped the attache case on the couch and was sitting in an adjacent chair , leaning forward , still shaking . " Calm down ; try to relax . " Converse walked to the elegant antique hunt table against the wall where there was a large silver tray with whisky , ice and glasses . Joel had learned to make use of room service in English . " You need a drink , " he said , pouring Fitzpatrick 's bourbon . " Do I ever ! I 've never been shot at . You have . Christ , is that what it 's like ? " " That 's what it 's like . You ca n't believe it . It 's unreal , just mindblowing sounds that ca n't really have anything to do with you , until  --  until you see the evidence for yourself . It 's real , it 's meant for you , and you 're sick . There 's no swelling music , no brass horns , just vomit . " Converse brought the naval officer his drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the glass and looking up at Joel . " No , I 'm not . Let 's think about tonight . If you heard Dowling right , the ambassador wo n't say anything around the embassy ? " " I remember , " interrupted Fitzpatrick , taking several swallows of the bourbon , his eyes still on Converse . " It was in one of the other flags . During your second escape a man got killed ; it was sundown . You reached  | him when it happened , and the flag said you went crazy for a couple of minutes . Somehow , according to this guy  --  a sergeant , I think  --  you circled around in the jungle , caught the North Vietnamese , killed him with his own knife and got his repeating rifle . Then you blew away three other Viets in the area . " Joel held his place in front of the Navy lawyer . He answered the younger man , his voice quiet , his look angry . " I hate descriptions like that , " he said flatly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me tell you the way it was  --  like it was , counselor . A kid , no more than nineteen , had to relieve himself , and although we stuck together he had the dignity to go ten or fifteen feet away to take care of his private functions , using leaves because squeezable toilet paper was n't available . The maniac  --  I wo n't use the word ' soldier ' ? who killed him waited for the precise moment , then fired off a burst that cut that kid 's face apart . When I reached him , half of that face in my hands , I heard the cackle , the obscene laughter of an obscene man who personified for me everything I found despicable ? whether North Vietnamese or American . If you want to know the truth , whatever I did I did against both  --  because both were guilty , all of us turned into animals , myself included . Those other three men , those enemies , those uniformed robots , probably with wives and children back in villages somewhere up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shot them in the back , counselor . What would Johnny Ringo say about that ? Or John Wayne ? " Connal was silent as Joel walked over to the hunt table to pour himself a whisky . The Navy lawyer drank , then spoke . " A few hours ago you said you knew where I was coming from because you 'd been there . Well , I have n't been where you were , but I 'm beginning to see where you 're coming from . You really hate everything that Aquitaine stands for , do n't you ? Especially those running it . " Converse turned . " With everything that 's in me , " he said . " That 's why we 've got to talk about tonight . " " I told you , I had no choice . You said the embassy people I saw at the airport were with Delavane . I could n't take the chance . " " I know . Now we 're both running , hunted by our own people and protected by the men we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The telephone rang twice abrasively . Fitzpatrick leaped from the chair , his initial reaction one of shock . Joel watched him , calming him with his look . " Sorry , " said Connal . " I 'm still edgy . I 'll get it ; I 'll be all right . " The Navy lawyer crossed to the phone and picked it up . la ? " He listened for several seconds , covered the mouthpiece and looked at Converse . " It 's the overseas operator . San Francisco . It 's Mcagen. "  | " Which means Remington , " said Joel , his throat suddenly dry , his pulse accelerating . " Meagen ? Yes , I 'm here . What is it ? " Fitzpatrick stared straight ahead as his sister talked ; he nodded frequently , the muscles of his jaw working as he concentrated . " Oh , Christ ! . . . No , it 's all right . I mean it , everything 's okay . Do you have the number ? " Connal looked down at the small telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced over at Joel , who had already started for the desk and a hotel pen . Fitzpatrick held out his hand , took the pen and wrote out a series of numbers . Converse stood aside , conscious that he was barely breathing , his fingers gripping the glass . " Thanks , Meagen . I know it 's a hell of a time for you ; you do n't need this , but if you have to call again , make it station-tostation , okay ? . . . I will , Meg , I give you my word . Good-bye . " The Navy lawyer hung up , his hand for a moment remaining on the telephone . " Remington called , did n't he ? " said Joel . " Yes . " " What happened ? " " Someone tried to get the flag on your service record released , " said Fitzpatrick , turning , looking at Converse . " It 's okay . Remington stopped it . " Who was it ? " " I do n't know , I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a flag is , much less who you are . The message was only that a release was sought for the flag , ' but he stopped it . " " Then everything 's all right . " " That 's what I said , but it 's not . " " Clarification , goddamn it ! " " There 's a time limit on how long my order stands . It 's only a day or two after the vetting process ? " " Which is forty-eight hours , " interrupted Joel . " Yes , I 'm sure of that ; it 's after that . You see , you thought this would happen , but frankly I did n't . Whoever 's asking for that flag is n't small potatoes . You could walk out of that meeting and a few hours later your new associates could have that stuff in their hands . Converse the Delavane-hater . Is he now the Delavane-hunter ? " " Call Remington . " Joel went to the French doors , opened them , and walked out on the srnall balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to the east there were flashes of heat lightning reminding Converse of the silent artillery fire he and the other escaping prisoners would see in the hills , knowing it was sanctuary but unreachable . He could hear Fitzpatrick inside ; from the sound of his voice he was getting a line  | through to San Diego . Joel reached into a pocket for his cigarettes ; he lighted one . Whether it was the bright glow of the flame that illuminated the movement he did not know , but he looked in the direction of that movement . Two balconies away , about thirty feet to his right , a man stood watching him . The figure was a silhouette in the dim light ; he nodded and went back inside . Was the man simply another guest who had coincidentally gone outside for a breath of air ? Or had Aquitaine posted a guard ? Converse could hear the Navy lawyer talking conversationally ; he turned and walked back into the room . Connal was seated in the chair on the other side of the table . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his right held the pen above the message pad . He made a note , then said quickly . " Wait a minute . You say Hickman told you to let it ride but he would n't tell you who specifically made the request ? . . . I see . All right , David , thanks very much . Are you going out tonight ? . . . So if I need you I can reach you at this number . ... Yes , I know , it 's these damn phones up in Sonoma . One heavy rain in the hills and you 're lucky to get a line , forget a clear one . Thanks again , David . Good-bye . " Fitzpatrick hung up the phone and looked strangely , almost guiltily , at Joel . Instead of speaking , he shook his head , breathing out and frowning . " What is it ? What 's the matter ? " " You 'd better get everything you can at that meeting tomorrow . Or is it today ? " " It 's past midnight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours later that flag will be released to a section in the Fifth Naval District  --  that 's Norfolk , and it 's powerful . They 'll know everything you do n't want them to know about you . The time limit is seventy-two hours . " " Get an extension ! " Connal stood up , helplessness in his expression . " On what basis ? " " What else ? National security . " " I 'd have to spell out the reasons , you know that . " " I do n't know that . Extensions are granted for all sorts of contingencies . You need more time to prepare . A source or a witness has been postponed  --  illness or an injury . Or personal matters  --  goddamn it , your brother-in-law 's funeral , your sister 's grief  --  they 've delayed your prog-ress ! " " Forget it , Joel . If I tried that , they 'd tie you in with Press and good-bye Charlie . They killed him , remember ? " " No , " said Converse firmly . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " What are you talking about ? " " I 've thought about this , tried to put myself in Avery 's shoes . He knew his every move was being watched , his telephone probably tapped . He said the geography , the Comm Tech  --  Bern merger , the breakfast , Geneva itself , everything had to be logical ; it could n't be any other way . At the end of that breakfast he said if I agreed we 'd talk later . " " So ? " " He knew we 'd be seen together  --  it was unavoidable  --  and I think he was going to give me the words to say if someone in Aquitaine asked me about him . He was going to turn everything around and give me the push I needed to reach these . men . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " " Avery was going to stamp me with the label I had to wear to get inside Delavane 's network . We 'll never know , but I have an idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , A. Preston Halliday , suspected me of being one of them , that he had inserted himself in the Comm Tech  --  Bern merger to threaten me with exposure , to stop me . " " Wait a minute . " Connal shook his head . " Press did n't know what you were going to do or ' how you were going to do it . " " There was only one way to do it , he knew that ! He also knew I 'd reach the same conclusion once I understood the particulars . The only way to stop Delavane and his field marshals is to infiltrate Aquitaine . Why do you think all that money was put up front ? I do n't need it and he knew he could n't buy me . But he knew it could be used  --  would have to be used to get inside and start talking , start gathering evidence . . . . Call Remington again . Tell him to prepare an extension . " " It 's not Remington , it 's the commander of SAND PAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect a call from him tomorrow . I 'll have to figure that one out and phone Meagen back . Hickman 's uptight ; he wants to know who you are and why all the interest . " " How well do you know this Hickman ? " " Fairly well . I was with him in New London and Galveston . He requested me as his CLO in San Diego ; that 's what gave me the stripe . " Converse studied Fitzpatrick 's face , then without saying anything he turned and walked to the open balcony doors . Connal did not interrupt ; he understood . He had seen too many attorneys , himself included , struck by a thought they had to define for themselves , an idea upon which a case might hinge . Joel turned around slowly , haltingly , the dim , abstract shadows of a possibility coming into focus . " Do it , " he began . " Do what I think your brother-in-law might have done . Finish what he might have said but never got a chance to say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merger conference . Give me the springboard I need . " " As you would say , clarification , please , counselor . " " Present Hickman with a scenario as it might have been written by A. Preston Halliday . Tell him that flag 's got to remain in place because you have reason to believe I was connected with your brother-in-law 's murder . Explain that before Halliday flew to Geneva he came to see you  --  as he did  --  and told you he was meeting me , an opposing attorney he suspected of being involved with corrupt export licensing , a legal front for some boardroom profiteers . Say he said he was going to confront me . Preston Halliday had a history of causes . " " Not for the past ten or twelve years , he did n't , " corrected Fitzpatrick . " He joined the establishment with a vengeance and with a healthy respect for the dollar . " " It 's the history that counts . He knew that ; it was one of the reasons he came to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since millions are made out of that business , you think I methodically had him removed , covering myself by being there when he died . I have a certain reputation for being methodical . " Connal lowered his head and ran his hand through his hair , then walked in thought toward the hunt table . He stopped , raised his gaze to one of the racehorse prints and turned back to Converse . " Do you know what you 're asking me to do ? " " Yes . Give me the springboard that 'll catapult me right in the middle of those would-be Genghis Khans . To do it you 'll have to go further with Hickman . Because you 're so personally involved and so goddamned angry ? which again is the truth  --  tell him to explain your position to whoever wants the flag released . It 's a nonmilitary matter , so you 're taking what you know to the civilian authorities . " " I understand all that , " said Fitzpatrick . " Everything I say is the truth , as I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except that I reverse the targets . Instead of being the one who can help me , you 're now the one I want nailed . " " Right on , counselor . And I 'm met by a welcoming committee at Leifhelm 's estate . " - " Then I guess you do n't see . " " What ? " " You 're asking me to go on record implicating you in first-degree murder . I 'll he branding you as a killer . Once I say it , I ca n't take the words hac . " 1 know that . Do it "  | George Marcus Delavane twisted his torso in his chair behind the desk in front of the strangely colored fragmented map on the wall . It was not a controlled movement ; it was an action in search of control . Delavane did not care for obstructions and one was being explained to him now by an admiral in the Fifth Naval District . " The status of the flag is Four Zero , " said Scanlon . " To get it released we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to tell you what that means . Two senior officers , one from naval intelligence , plus a supporting signature from the National Security Agency ; all would have to appear on the request sheet , the level of the inquiry stated , thus escalating the request to a sector demand . Now , General , we can do all this , but we run the risk ? " " I know the risk , " interrupted Delavane . " The signatures are the risk , the identities a risk . Why the Four Zero ? Who placed it and why ? " " The chief legal officer of SAND PAC . I checked him out . He 's a lieutenant commander named Fitzpatrick , and there 's nothing in his record to give us any indication as to why he did it . " " I 'll tell you why , " said the warlord of Saigon . " He 's hiding something . He 's protecting this Converse . " " Why would a chief legal officer in the Navy protect a civilian under these circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exercise a Four Zero condition ? It only calls attention to his action . " " It also clamps a lid down on that flag . " Delavane paused , then continued before the admiral could interrupt . " This Fitzpatrick , " he said . " You 've checked the master list ? " " He 's not one of us . " " Has he ever been considered ? Or approached ? " " I have n't had time to find out . " There was the sound of a buzzer , not part of the line over which the two men spoke . Scanlon could be heard punching a button , his voice clear , officious . " Yes ? " Silence followed , and seconds later the admiral returned to Palo Alto . " It 's Hickman again . " " Maybe he has something for us . Call me back . " " Hickman would n't give us anything if he had the slightest idea we existed , " said Scanlon . " In a few weeks , he 'll be one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be shot . " " Call me back , " said George Marcus Delavane , looking at the map of the new Aquitaine on the wall . Chaim Abrahms sat at the kitchen table in his small stone Mediterranean villa in Tzahala , a suburb of Tel Aviv favored by the retired military and  | those with sufficient income or influence to live there . The windows were open and the breezes from the garden stirred the oppressive summer 's night air . There was air conditioning in two other rooms and ceiling fans in three more , but Chaim liked the kitchen . In the old days he and his men would sit in primitive kitchens and plan raids ; in the Negev , ammunition was often passed about while desert chicken boiled on a wood stove . The kitchen was the soul of the house . It gave warmth and sustenance to the body , clearing the mind for tactics  --  as long as the women left after performing their chores and did not interrupt the men with their incessant trivialities . His wife was asleep upstairs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her anymore , or she to him ; she could not help him now . And if she could , she would not . They had lost a son in Lebanon , her son she said , a teacher , a scholar , not a soldier , not a killer by choice . Too many sons were lost on both sides , she said . Old men , she said , old men infected the young with their hatreds and used Biblical legends to justify death in the pursuit of questionable real estate . Death , she cried . Death before talk that might avert it ! She had forgotten the early days ; too many forgot too quickly . Chaim Abrahms did not forget , nor would he ever . And his sense of smell was as acute as ever . This lawyer , this Converse , this talk ! It was all too clever ; it had the stench of cold , analytical minds , not the heat of believers . The Mossad specialist was the best , but even the Mossad made mistakes . The specialist looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain and say this action caused that reaction ; this punishment that commitment to vengeance . Too damned clever ! A believer was fueled by the heat of his convictions . They were his only motive , and they did not call for clever manipulations . Chaim knew he was a plainspoken man , a direct man , but it was not because he was unintelligent or lacked subtle perceptions ; his prowess on the battlefield proved otherwise . He was direct because he knew what he wanted , and it was a waste of time to pretend and be clever . In all the years he had lived with his convictions he had never met a fellow believer who allowed himself to waste time . This Converse knew enough to reach Bertholdier in Paris . He showed how much more he knew when he mentioned Leifhelm in Bonn and specifically named the cities of Tel Aviv and Johannesburg . What more did he have to prove ? Why should he prove it if his belief was there ? Why did he not plead his case with his first connection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Converse , was from somewhere else . The Mossad specialist said the motive was there for affiliation . He was wrong . The red-hot heat of the believer was not there . Only cleverness , only talk . And the specialist had not dismissed Chaim 's sense of smell . As well  | he should not , as the two sabras had fought together for years , as often as not against the Europeans and their conniving ways  --  those immigrants who held up the Old Testament as if they had written it , calling the true inhabitants of Israel uneducated ruffians or clowns . The Mossad specialist respected his sabra brother ; it was in his look , that respect . No one could dismiss the instincts of Chaim Abrahms , son of Abraham , archangel of darkness to the enemies of Abraham 's children . Thank God his wife was asleep . It was time to call Palo Alto . " My general , my friend . " " Shalom , Chaim , " said the warlord of Saigon . " Are you on your way to Bonn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're leaving . Van Headmer is in the air now . He 'll arrive at Ben Gurion at eight-thirty , and together we 'll take the ten o'clock flight to Frankfurt , where Leifhelm 's pilot will meet us with the Cessna . " " Good . You can talk . " " We must talk now , " said the Israeli . " What more have you learned about this Converse ? ' " He becomes more of an enigma , Chaim . " " I smell a fraud . " " So do I , but perhaps not the fraud I thought . You know what my assessment was . I thought he was no more than an infantry point , someone being used by more knowledgeable men  --  Lucas Anstett among them ? to learn far more than they knew or heard rumors about . I do n't discount a degree of minor leaks ; they 're to be anticipated and managed , scoffed at as paranoia . " " Get to the point , Marcus , " said the impatient Abrahms , who always called Delavane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , iii spite of the fact that Delavane 's father had insisted on it for his first son in honor of the Roman Caesar  --  the philosopher Marcus Aurelius , a proselytizer of moderation . " Three things happened today , " continued the former general in Palo Alto . " The first infuriated me because I could not understand it , and frankly disturbed me because it portended a far greater penetration than I thought possible from a sector I thought impossible . " " What was it ? " the Israeli broke in . " A firm prohibition was placed on getting part of Converse 's service record . " " Yes ! " cried Abrahms , in his voice the sound of triumph . " What ? "  | " Go on , Marcus ! I 'll tell you when you 're finished . What was the second calamity ? " " Not a calamity , Chaim . An explanation so blatantly offered it ca n't be turned aside . Leifhelm called me and said Converse himself brought up Anstett 's death , claiming to be relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy  --  that was the word he used . " " So instructed ! " Abrahm 's voice reverberated around the kitchen . " What was the third gift , my general ? " " The most bewildering as well as enlightening  --  and , Chaim , do not shout into the phone . You are not at one of your stadium rallies or provoking the Knesset . " " I am in the field , Marcus . Right now ! Please continue , my friend . " " The man who clamped the lid down on Converse 's military record is a naval officer who was the brother-in-law of Preston Halliday . " " Geneva ! Yes ! " " Stop that ! " " My apologies , my dear friend . It 's just all so perfect ! " " Whatever you have in mind , " said Delavane " may be negated by the man 's reason . This naval officer , this brother-in-law , believes Converse engineered Halliday 's murder . " " Of course ! Perfect ! " " You will keep your voice down ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was heard . " Again my deepest and most sincere apologies , my general . Was that all this naval officer said ? " " No , he made it clear to the commander of his base in San Diego that Halliday had come to him and told him he was meeting a man in Geneva he believed was involved with illegal exports to illegal destinations . An attorney for profiteers in armaments . He intended to confront this man , this international lawyer named Converse , and threaten to expose him . What do we have ? " " A fraud ! " " But on whose side , sabra ? The volume of your voice does n't convince me . " Be convinced ! I 'm right . This Converse is the desert scorpion ! " " What does that mean ? " " Do n't you see ? The Mossad sees ! " " The Mossad ? " " Yes ! I talked with our specialist and he senses what I smell  --  he admits the possibility ! I grant you , my general , my honored warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Converse might be genuine , that  | he wanted truly to be with us , but when I said I smelled bad meat , he granted one other , exceptional possibility . Converse may or may not be programmed , but he could be an agent for his government ! " " A provocateur ? " " Who knows , Marcus ? But the pattern is so perfect . First , a prohibition is placed on his military record  --  it will tell us something , we know that . Then he responds in the negative about the death of an enemy  --  not his , but ours , and claims he was his enemy too  --  so simple , so instructable . Finally , it is insinuated that this Converse was the killer in Geneva  --  so orderly , so precisely to his advantage . We are dealing with very analytical minds that watch every move in the chess game , and match every pawn with a king . " " Yet everything you say can be reversed . He could be ? " " He ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me why ? " " There is no heat , no fire in him ! It is not the way of a believer ! We are not clever , we are adamant ! " George Marcus Delavane said nothing for several moments , and the Israeli knew better than to speak . He waited until the quiet cold voice came back on the line . " Have your meeting tomorrow , General . Listen to him and be courteous ; play the game he plays . But he must not leave that house until I give the order . He may never leave it . " " Shalom , my friend . " " Shalom , Chaim. "  | Valerie approached the glass doors of her studio  --  identical with the doors of her balcony upstairs  --  and looked out at the calm , sun-washed waters of Cape Ann . She thought briefly of the boat that had dropped anchor so frighteningly in front of her house several nights ago . It had not been back ; whatever had happened was past , leaving questions but no answers . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man crawling up out of the cabin light , and the glow of the cigarette , and she still wondered what that man was doing , what he was thinking . Then she remembered the sight of the two men in the early light , framed by the dark rims of her binoculars  --  staring back at her with far more powerful lenses . Were they novices finding a safe harbor ? Amateurs navigating the dark waters of a coastline at night ? Questions , no answers . Whatever , it was past . A brief , disturbing interlude that gave rise to black imaginings  --  demons in search of logic , as Joel would say . She tossed her long , dark hair aside and returned to her easel , picking up a brush and putting the final dabs of burnt umber beneath the shadowed sand dunes of wild grass . She stepped back , studied her work , and swore to herself for the fifth time that the oil painting was finished . It was another seascape ; she never tired of them , and fortunately she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course there were those painters in the Boston-B(x)tlibay axis who claimed she had virtually cornered the  | market , but that was rubbish . Indeed her prices had risen satisfactorily as a result of the critical approval accorded her two showings at the Copley Galleries , but the truth was that she could hardly afford to live where she lived and the way she lived without at least a part of Joel 's check every month . Then again , not too many artists had a house on the beach with an attached twenty-by-thirty-foot studio enclosed by full-length glass doors and with a ceiling that was literally one entire skylight . The rest of the house , the original house , on the northern border of Cape Ann was more rambling-quaint than functional . The initial architecture was early-coastconfusion , with lots of heavy bleached wood and curliques , a balustraded second-story balcony , and outsized bay windows in the front room that were charming to look at and look out but leaked fiercely when the winter winds came off the ocean . No amount of putty or sashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for observing her beauty . Still , it was Val 's dream house , the one she had promised herself years ago she would someday be able to afford . She had come back from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris prepared to assault New York 's art world via the Greenwich Village  --  Woodstock route only to have stark reality alter her . plans . The family circumstances had always been sufficiently healthy for her to live comfortably , albeit not lavishly , throughout three years in college and two more in Paris . Her father was a passably good if excessively enthusiastic amateur painter who always complained that he had not taken the risks and gone totally into the fine arts rather than architecture . As a result , he supported his only child both morally and financially , in a very real sense living through her progress and devoted to her determination . And her mother  --  slightly mad , always loving , always supportive in anything and everything  --  would take terrible photographs of Val 's crudest work and send the pictures back to her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of museums and galleries and insane commissions . " The crazy Berlinerin , " her father would say fondly in his heavy Gallic accent . " You should have seen her during the war . She frightened us all to death ! We half expected she would return to headquarters some night with a drunken Goebbels or a doped-up Goring in tow , then tell us if we wanted Hitler to give her the word ! " Her father had been the Free French liaison between the Allies and the German underground in Berlin . A rather stiff Parisian autocrat who happened to speak German had been assigned to the cell in the Chariottcnburg , which coordinated all the activities of Berlin 's underground . He frequently said that he had more trouble with the wild Fraulein with the  | impetuous ideas than he had avoiding the Nazis . Nevertheless they married each other two months after the armistice . In Berlin . Where neither his family would talk to hers , nor hers to his . " We had two small orchestras , " her mother would say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some white cream sauce with deer droppings . " Whether family animosities had anything to do with it neither ever said , but the Parisian and the Berlinerin immigrated to St. Louis , Missouri , in the United States of America , where the Berlinerin had distant relations . The stark reality . Nine years ago , after she had settled in New York from Paris , a frightened , tearful father had flown in to see her and had told Val a terrible truth . His beloved crazy Berlinerin had been ill for years ; it was cancer and it was about to kill her . In desperation , he had spent nearly all the money he had , including unpaid second and third mortgages on the rambling house in Bellefontaine , to stem the disease . Among the profiteers were clinics in Mexico ; there was nothing else he could say . He could only weep , and his losses had nothing to do with his tears . And she could only hold her father and ask him why he had not told her before . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since Berlin , it was always we two . We fought then together ; we fight now as always  --  as one . Her mother died six days later , and six months after that her father lit a Gauloise on the screened-in porch and mercifully fell asleep , not to wake up . Valerie could not cry . It was a shock but not a tragedy . Wherever he was he wanted to be there . So Valerie Charpentier looked for a job , a paying job that did not rely on the sales of an unknown artist . What astonished her was not that employment was so easy to find , but that it had very little to do with the thick portfolio of sketches and line drawings she presented . The second advertising agency she applied to seemed more interested in the fact that she spoke both German and French fluently . It was the time of corporate takeovers , of multinational alliances where profits could be made on both sides of the Atlantic by the same single entities . Valerie Charpentier , artist-in-residence inside , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw and sketch rapidly and make presentations and speak the languages and she hated it . Still , it was a remarkable living for a woman who had anticipated a period of years before her name on a canvas would mean something . Then a man came into her life who made whatever affairs she had had totally forgettable . A nice man , a decent man  --  even an exciting man ?  | who had his own problems but did not talk about them , would not talk about them , and that should have given her a clue . Joel , her Joel , effusive one moment , withdrawn the next , but always with that shield , that facade of quick humor which was often as biting as it was amusing . For a while they had been good for each other . Both were ambitious for entirely different reasons  --  she for the independence that came with recognition , he for the wasted years he could never reclaim  --  and each acted as a buffer when the other faced disappointment or delay . But it all began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her but not to him . He became - mesmerized by his own progress , by his own determination , to the exclusion of everything else , starting with her . He never raised his voice or made demands , but the words were ice and the demands were increasingly there . If there was a specific point when she recognized the downhill slide , it was a Friday night in November . The agency had wanted her to fly to West Berlin ; a Telefunken account required some fast personal service and she was elected to calm the churning waters . She had been packing when Joel came home from work . He had walked into the bedroom of their apartment and asked her what she was doing , where she was going . When she told him , he had said , " You ca n't . We 're expected at Brooks ' house in Larchmont tomorrow night . Talbot and Simon 'll be there too . I 'm sure they 'll talk international . You 've got to be there . " She had looked at him , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Germany . It was the turning point ; the downhill race had begun , and within a brief few months she knew it was quickening to its finish . She quit the agency , giving up authority for the dog days of free-lancing , hoping the extra time she had to devote to him might help . It did not ; Ile seemed to resent any overt act of sacrifice , no matter how hard she tried to conceal it . His periods of withdrawal multiplied , and in a way she felt sorry for him . His furies were driving him and it was obvious that he disliked what was happening ; he disliked what he was but could not help himself . He was on his way to a burnout and she could not help him , either . If there had been another woman , she could have fought , staking out her claim and fiercely insisting on the right to compete , but there was no one else , only himself and his compulsions . Finally , she realized she could not penetrate his shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was what she had hurled at him : " Emotional burn-out ! " He had agreed in that quiet , kind voice and the next day he was gone . So she took him . Four years , she demanded , the exact amount of time he had taken from her . Those four years of heady generosity were about to come to an end , Val reflected , as she cleaned her brushes and scraped  | the palette . In January they were over , the last check , as always , posted by the fifteenth . Five weeks ago , during lunch at the Ritz in Boston , Joel had offered to continue the payments . He claimed he was used to them and was making more in salary and bonuses than he could spend soberly . The money was no hardship , and besides it gave him a certain stature among his peers and was a marvelous ploy to avoid prolonged entanglements . She had declined , borrowing words from her father or more likely her mother , saying that things were far better than they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " If they turn out otherwise , I 'm here . " Goddamn him ! Poor Joel . Sad Joel . He was a good man caught in the vortex of his own conflicts . And Val had gone as far as she could go  --  to go further was to deny her own identity . She would not do that ; she had not done it . She placed her brushes in the tray and walked to the glass doors that looked over the dunes and the ocean . He was out there , far away , still somewhere in Europe . Valerie wondered if he had given a thought to the day . It was the anniversary of their marriage . To summarize , Chaim Abrahms was molded in the stress and chaos of fighting for daily survival . They were years of neverending violent skirmishes , of outthinking and outliving enemies bent on killing not only whole sabra settlements but the desert Jews ' aspirations for a homeland as well as political freedom and religious expression . It is not difficult to understand where Abrahms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is frightening to think about where he is going . He is a fanatic with no sense of balance or compromise where other peoples with identical aspirations are concerned . If a man has a different stripe , whether of the same species or not , he is the enemy . Armed force takes precedence over negotiations in all matters , and even those in Israel who plead for more moderate stands based on totally secure borders are branded as traitors . Abrahms is an imperialist who sees an ever-expanding Israel as the ruling kingdom of the entire Middle East . An appropriate ending to this report is a comment he made after the well-known statement issued by the Prime Minister during the Lebanon invasion : " We covet not one inch of Lebanon . " Abrahms ' reply in the field to his troops  --  the majority by no means sympathetic  --  was the following . " Certainly not an inch ! The whole damned country ! Then Gaza , the Golan , and the West Bank ! And why not Jordan , then Syria , and Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We are the mighty children of Abraham ! " He is Delavane 's key in the volatile Middle East .  | It was nearly noon , the overhead sun beating down on the small balcony beyond the French doors . The late-breakfast remnants had been cleared away by room service ; only a silver pot remained on the hunt table . They had been reading for hours since the first coffee was brought to the suite at six-thirty . Converse put down the dossier , and reached for his cigarettes on the table by the armchair . It is not difficult to understand where Abrahms came from . . . but it is frightening to think about where he is going . Joel looked over at Connal Fitzpatrick , who was seated on the couch , leaning forward over the coffee table and reading a single page while making notes on the telephone message pad ; the Bertholdier and I , eifhelm dossiers were in two neat piles on his left . The Navy lawyer had said practically the same words to him , thought Converse , lighting a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from . . . . The inherent question put to Joel 's legal mind was simple : Where was he himself going ? Ile hoped to hell he knew . Was he an inept gladiator marching into a Roman arena facing far stronger , better-armed and superior talent ? Or were the demons from his own past turning him into his own sacrifice , leading him into the arena 's hot sand where angry , half-starved cats waited , ready to pounce and tear him apart ? So many questions , so many variables he was incapable of addressing . He only knew he could not turn back . Fitzpatrick looked up . " What 's the matter ? " he asked , obviously aware that Converse was staring in his direction . " You worried about the admi-ral ? " " Who ? " " Hickman , San Diego . " " Among other things . In the clear light of day , you 're sure he bought the extension ? " " No guarantees , but I told you he said he 'll call me if any emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do anything before consulting Inc . If he tries to reach me , Meagen knows what to do and I 'll lean harder . I f need be , I 'll claim point of personal privilege and demand a meeting with those unnamed people in the Fifth District , maybe go so far as to " ply they could be part of Geneva . That 'd be a full circle . We could end up with a standoff  --  the release of that flag only with a full-scale investigation of the circumstances . Irony and standoff . " " You wo n't have a standoff if he 's with them . He 'll override you . " " If he was with them , he would n't have told Remington he was going to call me . He would n't have said anything ; he 'd have waited the extra clay and let it go . I know him . He was n't just nonplussed , he was mad . I lc stands by his people and he does n't like outside pressures , especially ti pressures . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flag 's in place .  | I told you , he 's a lot angrier with Norfolk than with me . They wo n't even give him a reason ; they claim they ca n't . " Converse nodded . " All right , " he said . " Call it a case of nerves on my part . I just finished the Abrahms dossier . That maniac could blow up the whole Middle East all by himself and drag the rest of us in with him . ... What did you think of Leifhelm and Bertholdier ? " " As far as the information goes , they 're everything you said and then some . They 're more than just influential ex-generals with fistfuls of money , they 're powerful rallying symbols for what a lot of people think are justifiable extremes . That 's as far as the information goes  --  but the operative word for me is the information itself . Where did it come from ? " " That 's a step back . It 's there . " " It sure is , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Press used the phrase ' we ' ? ' the ones we 're after , ' the tools we can give you , ' the connections as we think they are . ' " " And we went over this , " insisted Joel . " The man in San Francisco , the one he went to who provided the five hundred thousand and told him to build cases against these people legally , and together they 'd turn them into plain and simple profiteers . It 's the ultimate ridicule for superpatriots . It 's sound reasoning , counselor , and that 's the we . " " Press and this unknown man in San Francisco ? " " Yes . " " And they could pick up a phone and hire someone to put together these ? " Fitzpatrick gestured at the two dossiers on his left . " Why not ? This is in the age of the computer . Nobody today lives on an unmapped island or in an undiscovered cave . " " These , " said Connal , " are not computer printouts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the importance of political nuances and personal idiosyncrasies . " " You have a way with words , sailor . Yes , they are . A man who can forward half a million dollars to the right bank on an Aegean island can hire just about anyone he likes . " " He ca n't hire these . " " What does that mean ? " " Let me take a real step back , " said the Navy lawyer , getting to his fed and reaching down for the single page he had been reading . " I wo n't reiterate the details of my relationship with Press because right now it hurts a little to think about it . " Fitzpatrick paused , seeing the look iii Converse 's eyes that rejected this kind of sentimentality in their discus slot ' . " Do n't mistake Inc , " he continued . " It 's not his death , not Hu .  | funeral ; it 's the other way around . It 's not the Press Halliday I knew . You see , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then you know something I do n't know , " said Converse quietly . " I know there 's no man in San Francisco that even vaguely fits the description of the image he gave you . I 've lived there all my life , including Berkeley and Stanford , just like Press . I knew everyone he knew , especially the wealthiest and the more exotic ones ; we never held back on those with each other . I was legal worlds away , and he always filled me in if new ones came along . It was part of the fun for him . " " That 's tenuous , counselor . I 'm sure he kept certain associations to himself . " " Not those kinds , " said Connal . " It would n't be like him . Not with me . " Well , I ? " " Now let me step forward , " interrupted Fitzpatrick . " These dossiers ? I have n't seen them before , but I 've seen hundreds like them , maybe a couple of thousand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel sat up . " Please explain that , Commander . " " You just hit it , Lieutenant . The rank says it . " " Says what ? " " Those dossiers are the reworked , finished products of intelligence probes utilizing heavy shots of military data . They 've been bounced around the community , each branch contributing its input  --  from straight biographical data to past surveillances to psychiatric evaluation  --  and put together by teams of specialists . Those were taken from way down in the government vaults and rewritten with current additions and conclusions , then shaped to appear as the work of an outside , nongovernment authority . But they 're not . They 've got Classified , Top Secret , and Eyes Only written all over them . " Converse leaned forward . " That could be a subjective judgment based on limited familiarity . I 've seen some very detailed , very in-depth reports put together by high-priced firms specializing in that sort of thing . " " Describing precise military incidents during the time of war ? Pinpointing bombing raids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detailing through interviews the internal conflicts of ranking enemy officers and the tactical reasons for shifting military personnel into civilian positions after the cessation of hostilities ? No firm would have access to those materials . " " They could be researched , " said Joel , suddenly not convinced himself . " Well , these could n't , " Connal broke in , holding up the page of type-  | written names , his thumb on the lower two columns listing the " decision makers " from the Pentagon and the State Department . " Maybe five or six  --  three from each side at maximum  --  but not the rest . These are people above the ones I 've dealt with , men who do their jobs under a variety of titles so they ca n't be reached  --  bribed , blackmailed , or threatened . When you said you had names , I assumed I 'd recognize most of them , or at least half of them . I do n't . I only know the departmental execs , upper-echelon personnel who have to go even higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gotten these names himself or through others on the outside . He would n't know where to look and they would n't know where to look  --  I would n't know . " Converse rose . " Are you sure you know what you 're talking about ? " " Yes . Someone  --  probably more than one  --  deep in the Washington cellars provided these names just as he or they provided the material for those dossiers . " " Do you know what you 're saying ? " Connal stood still and nodded . " It 's not easy for me to say , " he began grimly . " Press lied to us . He lied to you by what he said , and to me by what he did n't say . You 're tied to a string and it goes right back to Washington . And I was n't to know anything about it . " " The puppet 's in place . . . . " Joel spoke so softly he could barely be heard as he walked aimlessly across the room toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Fitzpatrick . " Nothing , just a phrase that kept running through my head when I heard about Anstett . " Converse turned . " But if there 's a string , why have they hidden it ? Why did Avery hide it ? For what purpose ? " The Navy lawyer remained motionless , his face without expression . " I do n't think I have to answer that . You answered it yourself yesterday afternoon when we were talking about me  --  and do n't kid yourself , Lieutenant , I knew exactly what you were saying . I 'll give you a name now and then that may open a door . . . but that 's all . ' Those were your words . Freely translated , you were telling yourself that the sailor you took on board might stumble on to something , but in case he was taken by the wrong people , they could n't beat out of him what he did n't know . " Joel accepted the rebuke , not merely because it was justified , but because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood on Mykonos . Beale had told him that among those raising questions in Washington were military men who for one reason or another had not pursued their inquiries ; they had kept silent They had kept silent where they might be  | overheard , perhaps , but they had not totally kept their silence . They had talked in quiet voices until another quiet voice from San Francisco  --  a man who knew whom to reach courtesy of a brother-in-law in San Diego ? made contact . They had talked together , and out of their secret conversations had come a plan . They needed an infiltrator , a man with the expertise who had a loathing they could fuel and , once fired , send out into the labyrinth . The realization was a shock , but oddly enough , Joel could not fault the strategy . He did not even fault the silence that remained after Preston Halliday 's murder ; loud accusing voices would have rendered that death meaningless . Instead , they had stayed quiet , knowing that their puppet had the tools to make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not do themselves . He understood that , too . But there was one thing Converse could not accept , and that was his own expendability as the puppet . He had tolerated being left unprotected under the conditions outlined by Avery Fowler  --  Preston Halliday , not under these . If he was on a string , he wanted the puppeteers to know he knew it . He also wanted the name of someone in Bonn he could call , someone who was a part of them . The old rules did not apply any longer , a new dimension had been added . In four hours he would be driven through the iron gates of Erich Leifhelm 's estate ; he wanted someone on the outside , a man Fitzpatrick could reach if he did not come out by midnight . The demons were pressing hard , thought Joel . Still , he could not turn back . He was so close to trapping the warlord of Saigon , so close to making up for so much that had warped his life in ways no one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one , ' he reflected . One person did , and she had said she could not help him any longer . Nor had it been fair any longer to seek her help . " What 's your decision ? " said Connal . " Decision ? " asked Joel , startled . " You do n't have to go this afternoon . Throw it all back ! This belongs Stateside with the FBI in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency overseas . I 'm appalled they did n't take that route . " Converse breathed the start of a reply , then stopped . It had to be clear , riot only to Fitzpatrick but to himself . He thought he understood . He had seen the look of profound panic in Avery Fowler 's eyes  --  Preston Halliday 's eyes-and he had heard the cry in his voice . The lies were his strategy , but the look and the cry were his innermost feelings . " Has it occurred to you , Commander , that they ca n't take that route ? That , perhaps , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone ? as you said before  --  and put those wheels in motion ? Or if they tried ,  | they 'd have their heads cut off , perhaps literally , with an official rebuke and a bullet in the back of their skulls ? Let me add that I do n't think they 're afraid for themselves any more than I believe they chose the best man for the job , but I do think they came to a persuasive conclusion . They could n't work from the inside because they did n't know whom they could trust . " " Christ , you 're a cold son of a bitch . " " Ice , Commander . We 're dealing with a paranoid fantasy called Aquitaine , and it 's controlled by proven , committed , highly intelligent and resourceful men , who if they achieve what they 've set out to do will appear as the voices of strength and reason in a world gone mad . They 'll control that world  --  our world  --  because all other options will pale beside their stability . Stability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose if you were an everyday nine-to-fiver with a wife and kids , and you could never be sure when you went home at night whether or not your house had been broken into , your wife raped , your kids strangled ? You 'd opt for tanks in the street . " " With justification , " said the Navy lawyer , the two words spiraling quietly off into the air of the sunlit room . " Believe that , sailor . They 're banking on it , and that 's just what they 're planning to do on an international scale . It 's only a few days or a few weeks away  --  whatever it is , wherever it is . If I can just get an inkling ... " Converse turned and started for the door of his bedroom . " Where are you going ? " asked Connal . " Beale 's telephone number on Mykonos ; it 's in my briefcase . He 's my only contact and I want to talk to him . I want him to know the puppet has just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel stood at the table , the phone to his ear as the Greek operator in Athens routed his call to the island of Mykonos . Fitzpatrick sat on the couch , Chaim Abrahms ' dossier in front of him on the coffee table , his eyes on Converse . " Are you getting through all right ? " asked the Navy lawyer . " It 's ringing now . " The erratic , stabbing signals kept repeating  --  four , five , six times . On the seventh the telephone in the Aegean was picked up . " Herete. ? " " Dr. Beale , please . Dr. Edward Beale . " " Tee tha thelete ? " " Beale . The owner of the house . Get him for me , please ! " Joel turned to Fitzpatrick . " Do you speak Greek ? " No , but I 've been thinking about taking it up . "  | " You do that . " Converse listened again to the male voice in Mykonos . Greek phrases were spoken rapidly , none comprehensible . " Thank you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping the overseas line was still open and the English-speaking Greek operator was still there . " Operator ? Is this the operator in Athens ? . . . Good ! I want to call another number on Mykonos , the same billing in Bonn . " Converse reached down on the table for the instructions Preston Halliday had given him in Geneva . " It 's the Bank of Rhodes . The number is ... " Moments later the waterfront banker , Kostas Laskaris , was on the line . Herete . " " Mr. Laskaris , this is Joel Converse . Do you remember me ? " Of course . . . . Mr. Converse ? " The banker sounded distant , somehow strange , as if wary or bewildered . " I 've been trying to call Dr. Beale at the number you gave me , but all I get is a man who ca n't speak English . I wondered if you could tell me where Beale is . " A quiet expulsion of breath could be heard over the phone . " I wondered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a police officer , Mr. Converse . I had him placed there myself . A scholar has many valuable things . " " Why . What do you mean ? " " Shortly after sunrise this morning Dr. Beale took his boat out of the harbor , accompanied by another man . Several fishermen saw them . Two hours ago Dr. Beale 's boat was found crashed on the rocks beyond the Stephanos . There was no one on board . " I killed him . With a scaling knife , dropping his body over a cluster of sharks beyond the shoals of the Stephanos . Joel hung up the phone . Halliday , Anstett , Beale , all of them gone ? all his contacts dead . He was a puppet on the loose , his strings gone
