Their new Japanese business partners will ship in fully assembled bathrooms , along with the workers to install them . If Japanese entrepreneurs are desired , the Japanese told the Russians , they should provide hot baths and clean facilities - and a Japanese-staffed restaurant , which the Japanese would contribute. // // Wherever a visitor goes in the Soviet Far East - from the city of Khabarovsk on the shore of the Amur River near China to Sakhalin Island - Soviets are enthusiastically seeking foreign business partners . But , with a handful of hopeful exceptions , they are largely coming up empty-handed. // The response of Japanese business , the main target of Soviet efforts , has been particularly cool . The Soviets are eagerly promoting visits from South Korean businessmen , clearly hoping the Japanese will respond to the presence of their Korean rivals . So far , only 20 joint ventures have been established in the Soviet Far East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small companies. // Potential foreign investors complain the area lacks the most basic infrastructure - roads , dependable electricity , and telephones - and the commitment from Moscow to develop it . Despite promises of liberalization , investors face obstacles getting profits out , while the Soviets lack the foreign currency to buy their goods or machinery. // The Soviet Far East is a vast region of tundra and forests , frozen under snows for half the year and water-drenched and mosquito-ridden during the spring and summer . Only 7. 9 million people live in an area of nearly 4 million square miles stretching from Yakut , a republic larger than Western Europe , to the Bering Strait . It is also a land of great natural wealth - of endless forests , of rivers and coastal waters teeming with fish , of rich reserves of coal , oil , gas , and minerals. // In 1986 Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited the Pacific port of Vladivostok and delivered a speech envisioning the development of the region ' s resources , offering to open the area to foreigners .

And Moscow promised to let local enterprises and governments make their own deals with foreigners. // Soviet economic planners and local officials admit these ideas remain largely on paper. // ' ' It would be idealistic to wait for Moscow to provide money , ' ' says economist Nadezhda Mikheeva of the Institute for Economic Research in Khabarovsk , part of the prestigious Academy of Sciences . Development must come from ' ' local resources. ' ' // The region earns profits from its raw materials , including exports worth 900 million rubles ( about $1. 4 billion ) . Half the exports go to China and Japan. // But , says institute director Piotr Baklanov , the ministries in Moscow ' ' take the profit .

But the bureaucrats in Moscow have shown little enthusiasm for the limited efforts in that direction. // Last year , permission was given to far eastern enterprises to engage in foreign trade , which resulted in a boom in cross-border barter trade with China . Enterprises traded timber , steel , fish , and coal for Chinese consumer goods , selling them back home for healthy profits. // But the ' ' magic of the market ' ' was too chaotic for authorities in Moscow . They complained that the enterprises were selling Soviet goods too cheaply , paying too much for Chinese products , and creating shortages of building materials . On March 7 , Moscow clamped down on this brief experiment , forcing each enterprise to get a license from a ministry in Moscow to be able to sell . Virtually every community in the region looks to the special economic zones as a salvation , hoping Moscow will give permission .

' ' // In China , such special zones brought in Japanese businessmen and others attracted by cheap labor to assemble electronics and other consumer goods for export . But labor in the Soviet Far East is expensive and scarce . Tens of thousands of Chinese , North Koreans , and Vietnamese are imported to work here . The Soviets have also been slow to allow convertibility of the ruble , making it impossible for foreigners to bring out profits in hard currency. // Japanese businessmen repeatedly raise these complaints in explaining their reluctance to invest in the Soviet Far East. // Also , the Japanese government quietly pressures business to restrain activity , providing leverage for Japan ' s demands for return of a group of islands in the Southern Kuriles . The Soviet Union seized the islands at the close of World War II . Some Soviet officials say Japanese investment will boom if the issue is solved. // But most agree with Sakhalin Oblast ( Region ) chief executive Ivan Kuropatko who says , ' ' The main thing is the economic benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' // High economic growth in Japan is renewing interest in Siberian raw materials , says Hisao Kanamori , chairman of the Japan Center for Economic Research . Mr. Kanamori is an active participant in Japan-Soviet business discussions . He says he foresees a triangular combination of Chinese labor , Soviet resources , and capital from Japan and South Korea. // Japanese and Soviet entrepreneurs met for three days at the end of August . The Japanese agreed to a feasibility study of a 200 , 000-ton paper plant in southern Sakhalin , which would reportedly be the largest joint venture to date for the Soviet Union . Interest has revived in a moribund project to develop offshore oil and gas reserves. // Japanese involvement in Sakhalin harks to the era from 1905 to 1945 when Japan controlled the southern half of the island. // But Soviet economic planners worry that the Japanese and the South Koreans ' ' want to make the Soviet Union play the everlasting role of an underdeveloped source of raw materials , ' ' says Pavel Minakir , deputy director of the Institute for Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard many times in Sakhalin - their preferred partners are Americans. // ' ' It is psychologically easier for us to understand the Americans - and they can understand us more easily as trade partners , ' ' Mr. Minakir says .
