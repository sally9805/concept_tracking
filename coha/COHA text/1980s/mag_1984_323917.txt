For most of its 4,500 years , the Great Sphinx stood guard over the pyramids of Giza from behind a 14-ft. limestone beard . Now , centuries after unknown forces gave the enigmatic monument a shave , some Egyptian authorities want to restore the Sphinx to its former hirsute splendor . Their interest is more than cosmetic . Because the neck of the 66-ft-high statue has been badly eroded by centuries of exposure to the elements , even a moderate earth tremor could send the entire 965-ton head rolling off . Says Culture Minister Mohammed Radwan : " The only acceptable way to avoid further deterioration and to support the head is to replace the beard . " <P> Only 15% of the original beard is known to exist . Most of that is in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo , but a 31 - in. - long fragment sits in a back room at the British Museum in London . The Egyptians want the missing link reinstated . The British have agreed to loan them the fragment , but only on condition that it be returned to London within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monument . Fearing that Anglo-Egyptian relations may prove as hard to restore as pharaonic constructions , the Egyptians have hit upon a Solomonic solution : while negotiations continue , a temporary beard made of lightweight material will be installed to determine whether the public , and the Sphinx , can grow accustomed to a new look .
