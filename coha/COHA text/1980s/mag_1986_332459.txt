With gasoline prices low and fears of terrorism and radioactive fallout abroad relatively high , U.S. drivers are expected to hit the road in record numbers in 1986 . In its latest survey , the American Automobile Association forecasts that some 95 million Americans will take auto trips this summer , an 8% increase over 1985 . Many of those motorists are bound to indulge in a familiar American pastime : avoiding speed traps . Indeed , U.S. drivers in ever increasing numbers are turning for help in that unsporting effort to one of the hottest of automobile accessories , the miniature radar detector . <P> Once an obscure gadget found mostly on the dashboards of high-performance cars or in the cabs of long-haul trucks , the portable radar detector is fast becoming standard operating equipment in workaday Chevys , Fords and Toyotas . By beeping a warning whenever a police radar transmitter is operating nearby , the small ( as light as 6 oz. ) electronic gizmos give lead-footed drivers a chance to slow down before a police officer can spot a speeding violation . About 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% increase over 1984 . This year industry sales are expected to keep growing , from $250 million to more than $300 million . <P> The first commercial radar detector was invented in 1968 by , fittingly enough , a disgruntled motorist who felt that he had been unfairly nabbed for speeding . Dale Smith , a Dayton-area electronics whiz , dubbed his creation Fuzzbuster I. The theory behind the device is simple . Police radar sets bounce a microwave beam off an approaching car or truck in order to measure the speed at which the vehicle is moving . The target must be in a direct line of sight with the radar transmitter before an accurate reading can be taken . The radar emissions , however , can be detected by a simple electronic receiving device from a distance of a mile or more . When a Fuzzbuster-style receiver picks up such waves , it typically emits a high-pitched noise as a warning to the driver . <P> A host of competitors of the original Fuzzbuster have since roared onto the market . Some of the best-selling detectors are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to fit in a shirt pocket and sells for $295 . Thanks to his attentive little black boxes , Cincinnati Microwave Chairman and Co-Founder James Jaeger , 38 , is a multimillionaire who owns a fleet of Ferraris and says that , of course , he never gets speeding tickets . <P> Although speeding is , by definition , against the law , only Connecticut , Virginia and Washington have made it illegal to use radar detectors . But even in those jurisdictions , the bans are sparsely enforced because of legal challenges concerning , among other things , the freedom of access to radar frequencies . <P> One manufacturer backs its product with an unusual one-year guarantee . American Antenna of Elgin , Ill. , reimburses owners of its K40 receivers for speeding fines if the users are zapped by police radar .
