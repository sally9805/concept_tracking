This is what the last week of school is like . Spitballs fly , kids daydream . . . even the teachers take it easy . Exams are still a week away . In a game that had all the fervor and intensity of a Mister Rogers Telethon , the Celtics won a 115-113 scrimmage against the Detroit Pistons at the Garden yesterday . It was the first time this year that the Celtics were involved in a game that meant absolutely nothing to either team , and both sides played accordingly . The moribund Pistons were able to shut down the Celtics with about the same effectiveness that Red Sox starters have displayed thus far in the season . Scotty Robertson ' s troupe has tumbled tragically since stomping into the Garden and stuffing the Celtics , 131-114 , four months ago . Meanwhile , Celtic tactician Bill Fitch rested the indefatigable Larry Bird and Robert Parish , and left the game in the capable-but- rusty hands of Tiny Archibald , M. L. Carr , Rick Robey , Scott Wedman and Kevin McHale . It was theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter run . " I guess now we can rest the others and get everything rolling right for us , " said Robey , who emerged from Sleepy Pine , USA. , to score seven points and grab five rebounds in 23 minutes - his longest stint since New Year ' s Day . " We can rest Robert and Larry , and get time for the guys we ' re gon na need in the playoffs . " While Robey was working his way into shape , Scott Wedman stayed on the floor for 21 minutes , scored 12 points ( 6-10 from the floor ) , dished out four assists and grabbed a team-high six rebounds . Wedman has handled his pine time and other indignities with all the aplomb of an athleticAverill Harriman , and yesterday was no exception . " I ' d like to play as much as I can , " said the former All Star . " I won ' t speculate as to how much or when I ' m going to be playing , but I ' ll be ready . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an otherwise dull day . Henderson canned 11 of 14 shots and led the Celts with 22 points in only 25 minutes . Archibald , still recovering from a bruised left hand , bounded off the bench and scored 14 points ( with four assists ) in 19 minutes . All 12 Celtics played and scored . " When you talk about a game being won by an entire team , " said Fitch , " this one comes the closest . " Fitch went with his usual starting five , and they trailed , 19- 15 , with 5:22 left in the first period . But led by Henderson ( 12 in the quarter ) , the Celts outscored Detroit , 17-4 , to take a 32-23 lead at the end of one . In the second period , Quinn Buckner ( sprained right ankle ) made his first appearance in eight days . He scored six points in eight minutes and the Celts led , 59-44 , at halftime . After intermission , Isiah Thomas and Kelly Tripuka ( 26 each ) led the Pistons on a 15-2 surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had closed to within two , 67-65 . The Celtics never let Detroit any closer . Bird ( 13 ) and Parish ( 10 ) made sure Boston stayed ahead before they retired for the day , leaving the bench brigade with the job of keeping Boston on top . Fitch did not use a single starter in the fourth quarter . Two free throws by Bill Laimbeer ( 18 points , 11 rebounds ) pulled the Pistons to within three ( 109-106 ) with 1:48 left , but Tiny answered with twofrom the line and , after Isiah ' s three-pointer clanged off the rim and went out of bounds , McHale buried a turnaround to make it 113-106 with 47 seconds left . It was never in doubt after that . Vinnie Johnson ( 25 points ) hit an uncanny three- pointer at the buzzer , but many of the 15,320 were listening to their car radios by then . There ' ll be for more like this before it ' s over . The Celtics play at New Jersey and Detroit this week , and close out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend . None of the games means anything to any of the teams . But this recess won ' t last : Exams start next week .
