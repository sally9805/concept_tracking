There just wasn ' t much to distinguish this one from , say , any 650 or 700 of the previous 1584 Celtic triumphs in their glorious NBA history . The Garden fans have been there before . They ' ve seen start-to- finish triumphs in which the Celtics never trail , not even 1-0 . They ' ve seen first- period leads of 8-1 , 20-10 and 34-15 . They ' ve seen every Boston starter in the scoring column by the time the game was 3 1/2 minutes old before . They ' ve seen eight Celtics in double figures . They ' ve even seen their heroes expand a 97-74 three-quarter lead by scoring the first 13 points of the final period . So an opening night final of Boston 130 , Cleveland 103 qualified as deja vu , and nothing more . The destruction of the Cavaliers was so easy that it might have eliminated the possibility of legitimate Celtic analysis . The Cavaliers played like a team incapable of winning 10 games in this league . They simply can ' t be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense that let us down , " said Bill Musselman , whose NBA coaching debut probably ranked very low on his personal list of top 41,000 sports thrills . " They kept posting us , and nobody was helping out . We held a Chicago team with David Greenwood , Larry Kenon and Reggie Theus in the lineup to 25 points with four minutes to go in the half of one exhibition . I am very disappointed that we didn ' t play good set defense . " Defense was also on Bill Fitch ' s mind . " Our offense was spotty , but our defense was consistent . Early in the season , it ' s usually the other way around . " The Celtics simply never allowed Cleveland to play . It was as if the Celtics derived some mysterious benefit from the warm-ups that they were unwilling to share with their guests . Robert Parish got the Celtics started 19 seconds into the game with one of his medium- range turnaround jumpers , and the closest Cleveland would come the rest of the evening was a Randy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The checkpoint scores were 36-21 , 66-47 ( on an Eric Fernsten tap-in of a missed Gerry Henderson free throw with three seconds left ) and 97-74 . The Cavaliers only crept within 10 points once ( 36-27 ) in the final 40:30 of the game , and when they did , the Celtics responded with a run of eight straight points . The lead peaked at 36 twice ( 110-74 , 112-76 ) in the final quarter . Please understand that we are talking about a major league flogging . Primary floggers included M.L. Carr , who devoured young Roger Phegley in a Holmes-Ali type of big guard matchup ; Cedric Maxwell , who helped himself to seven rebounds and seven points on the offensive boards in the first period ; and Kevin McHale , who sparkled during the aforementioned second-quarter response and who made Mike Mitchell and Bill Robinzine the first two of what will probably become a cast of NBA thousands to find their shots sent up to the organist by this deceiving young frontcourt monster . What matters most to the first-night crowd , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoop worshippers departed the Garden feeling they had seen a group of players who thought and acted like Celtics . The ball moved the way it did last season . They came right out and gave the fans a Durante ; i.e. , everybody was getting into the act . It hardly appeared accidental that newcomer Parish received the ball early and often . " Sure , " said Carr , " Robert is a veteran , but you don ' t know how he ' s going to react out there on the Garden floor the first time as a Celtic . We wanted to get the jitters out early , if there was going to be any . It was nice to see him hit that shot right away . " " If I see Robert guarded by a guy 6-9 ( Dave Robisch , ) " added Larry Bird , " I ' m getting it into him . " While the Celtics were sharing the ball , the impotent Cavs could only turn to Mitchell during the first half . The brilliant young forward utilized an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s first 31 , 22 of its first 37 , 24 of its first 43 and , finally , 26 of its halftime 47 . He was 10 for 21 at the half . His mates were 7 for 28 . Cleveland ' s woes clearly extended beyond set defense . So what did it all mean ? If nothing else , it showed that the Celtic heads are in the right place . But it would be nice had the boys offered one up for the schedule maker when they said their beddy-by prayers . This really wasn ' t one of the great nights in Celtic history .
