Two mornings after a Providence jury acquitted Claus von Bulow , his defense lawyer , Thomas Puccio , arrived at his brand-new office in the Wall Street firm of Stroock &; Stroock &; Lavan . He was just in time to settle a dispute between his secretary and a decorator over where to put the black leather sofa and chair in relation to his black lacquer desk and bookcase . The firm 's partner of two months should be greeting many a new client from behind that desk . For in the wake of his Von Bulow victory last week , commentators across the country are suddenly ranking him among the best U.S. criminal-trial attorneys . <P> While Puccio is being showered with public accolades , however , some of his legal colleagues in New York City have private reservations . Says one old Puccio foe : " There is no limit to which he would n't go to get an advantage . " A former courtroom opponent who on the record calls Puccio " a very aggressive , very able lawyer , " adds confidentially , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw a grand piano . " Puccio , the former chief prosecutor of Abscam , knows he rubs many in the legal Establishment the wrong way . " I 'm very noninstitutional , " he acknowledges . " I 'm uncontrollable . " <P> Also " indefatigable , " says Lawyer Stephen Kaufman , who once lost to Puccio . " There is a saying that ' litigation is more perspiration than inspiration . ' He excels at perspiration . " Puccio and his four-member defense team began sweating over the Von Bulow case in late 1984 . Earlier that year the Rhode Island Supreme Court had reversed the Danish-born aristocrat 's 1982 conviction on charges that he twice tried to kill his socialite wife Martha ( " Sunny " ) von Bulow with insulin injections ; since 1980 she has lain in a coma from which she is expected not to recover . Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz had argued the successful appeal . Now the ball was Puccio 's . <P> During the second trial 's opening statements in April , the prosecution told the jury it would show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could inherit the millions he was promised in her will and marry his then mistress , former Soap Opera Actress Alexandra Isles . But some of the promised proof was never introduced . With carefully crafted motions , raising such issues as relevance and prosecutorial failure to lay necessary legal groundwork , Puccio persuaded Judge Corinne Grande to exclude Sunny von Bulow 's will , testimony from her financial adviser and evidence that Von Bulow knew how to use hypodermics . <P> After performing those feats of damage control , Puccio narrowed his own case to one clear , pointed counterpunch . No crime had been committed , he declared , because Mrs. Von Bulow had never been given any insulin . A series of medical experts backed his contention that there was no firm proof of insulin injection . With much of the circumstantial evidence against Von Bulow in tatters , most lawyers agree that the jury had little choice . But some disparaged Puccio 's performance . " What victory ? " snorted one former colleague . " Against a prosecutor with little experience and a judge who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Susan McGuirl , half of the prosecution team that convicted Von Bulow in 1982 : " Puccio made his own case very forcefully and challenged the state to prove otherwise . He tried the defense case like a prosecutor . I 've never seen that before . "
