FADE IN : HIGH ANGLE ESTABLISHING SHOT - CARBON CANYON - DAY Carbon Canyon meanders among the lower peaks of a dark , firclad cordillera . Winding along the floor of the Canyon , which varies in width from ten to fifty yards , Carbon Creek reflects the mid-morning sun .

She has taken only a half-dozen steps , however , when she pauses . Her eyes dart fearfully upstream as we HEAR a swelling , thundering NOISE above the musical sound of the creek . HULL BARRET He , too , hears the SOUND . Working his sluice in the shade of a huge , obstructive boulder , HULL pivots . Thirty-five , his honest features are scoured with sudden concern .

He extends a glass containing six full ounces of whiskey .

Then , of course , he 'd get to thinking about the Sunday collection . &nbsp; LAHOODHell , in a town as rich as Lahood , that preacher 'd be a wealthy man ! He sips from his drink , convinced the bait is irresistable . Gabriel , however , studies his glass of whiskey with a sigh . &nbsp; GABRIELI 'm afraid that 's why it would n't work .

I brought jobs , and industry . I 've built an empire with my own two hands , and I 've never asked help of anyone . Those squatters , Reverend , are standing in the way of Progress . &nbsp; GABRIEL ( mildly ) Whose progress ? Yours or theirs ? His affectation shattered , Lahood explosively extracts a folded paper from his coat and scales it across the desk  --  &nbsp; LAHOODLook at that ! That 's a writ  --  comes hot from Sacramento !

He glances only briefly toward Lahood 's place , TOWARD LENS , and then starts down the boardwalk at a leisurely pace , AWAY FROM CAMERA .  --  117  --  &nbsp; LAHOOD O.S. ( dumbfounded ) Jeeesus. . . ( a beat ) What the hell 's he doing now ? As we WATCH , Gabriel  --  having put some distance between himself and Lahood 's place  --  steps off the boardwalk , strides toward center-street. . . and stops there . EXT . MAIN STREET - LOW ANGLE - ON GABRIEL 'S FEET as they turn to face Lahood 's . A beat . Then six spent shells clatter INTO FRAME in the dust and CAMERA TILTS UP to Gabriel . Towering OVER LENS he calmly begins reloading his pistol . RESUME LAHOOD &amp; STOCKBURN as Stockburn releases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his employer 's question . &nbsp; STOCKBURNHe 's inviting us to join him . EXT . MAIN STREET - WITH GABRIEL  --  sliding shells into empty chambers . The soft click-click is inordinately loud in the utter stillness that prevails . A beat . And then he glances up toward : LAHOOD 'S PLACE as the door is opened from within . . . and with ritual precision Stockburn 's deputies emerge . Three to one side of the door . . . three to the other . As they had when Spider came to town , they flank the open door like phantom escorts to a ghostly leader . And in a moment  --  as when Spider came to town  --  Stockburn appears between the ranks of his disciples . ON GABRIEL He drops his gaze to his gun , slides home the last cartridge , snaps shut the cylinder . . . holsters the weapon . Now , face bathed in shadow beneath the brim of his hat , he looks across the distance separating him from Stockburn and his deputies . . .  --  118  --  . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stare down the street at : GABRIEL SEEN FROM THEIR POV as a vulnerable figure forty yards away . STOCKBURN &amp; HIS DEPUTIES Silently , as if at some unspoken command , the seven men descend the steps of Lahood 's building . . . cross the boardwalk. . . move onto the street . CLOSE ON GABRIEL Eyes narrowed , he watches the dark and disciplined platoon as  --  STOCKBURN &amp; HIS DEPUTIES  --  with the methodical rhythms of long experience they fan across the dusty street in an implacable line , facing : GABRIEL  --  his hand resting loosely near his pistol 's staghom handle . STOCKBURN &amp; HIS DEPUTIES - FULL SHOT They remain motionless for a beat . And then  --  with Stockburn moving first  --  they start forward down the street , a step at a time . ON GABRIEL as he , too , slowly advances . ON STOCKBURN 'S ARMY CAMERA DOLLIES ACROSS THEIR RANKS , BACK-TRACKS with them . For the record , left to right , their names are FOLKE , GRISSOM , KOBOLD , MATHER , SEDGE , TUCKER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands writhe like convulsive tendrils near his gun . TRACKING WITH GABRIEL Languid . . . watchful . . . poised . . . advancing . HIGH ANGLE - MAIN STREET The seven men marching down Main Street . Gabriel moving toward them . Separated by thirty-five yards . . . . . . . by thirty . . . . twenty-five . At once : DEPUTY GRISSOM goes for his gun . GABRIEL draws . STOCKBURN &amp; HIS MEN all draw . SUBJECTIVE CAMERA DOLLIES across the line of Stockburn 's men as the air EXPLODES with pistol fire , LENS blinded by the billowing fumes of burnt black powder . SUBJECTIVE CAMERA SHOOTS past Gabriel 's shoulder through the smoke of his own ROARING gun , toward the swirling black cloud that engulfs the opposition . SUBJECTIVE CAMERA HOLDS on Stockburn and his men as , their last bullets spent , they stop firing  --  the CAMERA 'S VIEW restored as the cunsmoke  --  120  --  Revealing Stockburn , Sedge , Kobold , and Folke still standing . Grissom , Mather , and Tucker are dead . But : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only his hat reposes in the dust . STOCKBURN He reacts with a cynical , knowledgeable smile . Briefly surveying his casualties  --  like a general on a battlefield  --  he shucks his spent brass and , reloding  --  &nbsp; STOCKBURN ( a terse command ) Fan out . Find him . Reloading their pistols , the deputies deploy as bidden . AWAY TO : EXT . OPEN COUNTRYSIDE - MEGAN - DAY Atop Hull 's buckboard , she careens across the lowlands at break-neck speed . As she races PAST LENS  --  BACK TO : TOWN - HIGH ANGLE A preternatural silence engulfs Lahood , California , as if the town had been afflicted with the Plague . ON MAIN STREET Gabriel 's hat still reposes in the dust , F. G. , while in B. G. Deputy Sedge moves stealthily AWAY FROM CAMERA down a narrow alley between a pair of two-story buildings  --  the most logical route for Gabriel to have taken . WITH SEDGE as he advances warily TOWARD LENS along the narrow defile between the buildings , the CAMERA DOLLYING BACK to disclose an open side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  As if touched by a gentle breeze , the door moves slightly on its hinges . But there is no breeze . SEDGE His eyes fix on the door . He knows who lurks just behind it . Fanning the hammer of his pistol , he empties it into the door : BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM ! ! ! ! THE DOOR  --  recoils on its hinges , its center portion blown away in a profusion of splinters . RESUME SEDGE as , quickly shucking his shells and reloading , he cautiously advances to the door , the CAMERA GOING WITH HIM . At the threshhold CAMERA STOPS  --  and Sedge steps into the dark interior , OUT OF SHOT . We wait . And then a single shot REVERBERATES from within . . . . and Sedge staggers backward through the door , into the sunlight . He remains erect for a moment  --  a look of profound surprise on his face  --  then he tumbles in a twisted heap . As CAMERA PUSHES IN we SEE the bullet-hole between his lifeless eyes . EXT . MAIN STREET - STOCKBURN Oddly silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ECHO of the shot . Meanwhile : DEPUTY KOBOLD scuttles INTO VIEW around a corner , pistol drawn . He pulls up , staring O.S. on , PAST LENS . FULL SHOT - LIVERY STABLE The huge barnlike structure squats across a side-street , black bay doors gaping . As we WATCH , Gabriel slips inside . HOLD . . . then WHIP-PAN to Kobold as he spots Gabriel disappearing inside the stable and with a cunning grin hurries noiselessly after him . FROM INSIDE THE STABLE Kobold is SEEN approaching  --  darting finally into the darkened interior , pressing up against a wall in the shadows as his eyes rake the place . PANNING THE STABLE 'S INTERIOR - KOBOLD 'S POV We SEE a massive sepulchre of shadows punctuated by thin rays of light which drift through chinks in the roof . A barn swallow peeps. . . horses munch contentedly in their stalls . . . tresses of alfalfa stream from the loft like maiden 's hair . No sign of Gabriel . RESUME KOBOLD He frowns uncertainly , looks toward  --  THE TACK ROOM Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stands , the tack-room is a three-walled space in which a mess of saddlery drips from wooden pegs . Amongst the gear and SEEN AS LENS ZOOMS IN , is a shotgun resting on a shelf . CLOSE SHOT - IN THE TACK ROOM Kobold 's hands thrust phantomlike INTO FRAME , remove the shotgun from its shelf  --  grab the box of shells beside it . The weapon 's breech is well-oiled , makes hardly a sound as Kobold breaks it open . Sliding a shell into each of the barrels , he snaps it shut . . . pulls back both hammers . . .  --  123  --  AND IN A SERIES OF SHOTS he lays down BLAST AFTER BLAST , the butt-plate slamming at his shoulder as he darts from post to shadowed post . His proficiency is such that there is hardly a pause between one salvo and the next : he loads and fires with lethal expertise , and no potential hiding-place escapes destruction . The charges rip into loft , hay-ricks and stalls  --  the horses pitch and scream : no hidden man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feet apart in a deluge of cats , while rotten timbers overhead are snapped and hay cascades PAST LENS in waves . A pellet-riddled rat crawls OUT OF VIEW ; and when at last his last shell is fired  --  KOBOLD stands just inside the tack-room , a motionless centurion. . . apparently triumphant . Silence . Then , as he reaches out to return the shotgun to the shelf  --  SHOCK CUT as if from nowhere , a twin-bladed axe whirs savagely TOWARD LENS . KOBOLD has only time to cape before  --  LOW ANGLE  --  his severed arm flops limply to the earth , the shotgun clutched in the lifeless fist . And as Kobold 's scream rends the air  --  AWAY TO : STOCKBURN A granite eminence , his eyes  --  and only his eyes  --  flick in the direction from which we HEAR his deputy 's protracted death-cry . BRIEF CUT - LAHOOD IN HIS OFFICE  --  124  --  pair of stiff whiskies . BACK TO : INT . LIVERY STABLE - FULL SHOT as  --  emerging from the shadows  --  Gabriel steps over Kobold 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big stable doors . SUBJECTIVE CAMERA SHOOTS ALONG THE SIGHTS of Deputy Folke 's pistol , TOWARD Gabriel as he appears some forty yards away  --  in the stable doorway . The pistol fires . ON GABRIEL The slug splinters wood an inch from his face and he whirls , throws himself inside the stable , presses himself against the interior wall . In a moment he peers tentatively out , trying to pin-point the location of the sole remaining deputy . SUBJECTIVE CAMERA AGAIN SHOOTS DOWN THE SIGHTS of Folke 's pistol , toward Gabriel who is briefly glimpsed inside the stable . The pistol fires again . RESUME GABRIEL as the bullet kicks up splinters , missing him by a hair's- breadth . He pivots inside . Effectively pinned down , he finds a chink between two upright timbers of the stable wall , peers through this slit to locate his antagonist . EFFECT SHOT LENS SCANS GABRIEL 'S POV through the slit . We SEE the window-less back wall of a clapboard building . . . next to it , a skinny picket fence . . . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then another windowless brick wall belonging to the bank . No sign of the gunman .  --  125  --  RESUME GABRIEL He frowns  --  ca n't figure out where Folke is concealed  --  peers through the slit a second time . And then it occurs to him . FULL SHOT - STABLE DOOR as Gabriel steps into full VIEW and empties his pistol PAST LENS  --  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM ! !  --  toward : THE WATERING TROUGH The six slugs smash through the side of the trough in a rhythmic horizontal pattern stitched across the length of it . Punctured , the trough disgorges six identical streams of clear water . And then , in a grotesque transformation . . . CLOSE SHOT . . . the water runs crimson . SUBMERGED IN THE TROUGH Folke 's body  --  pistol still clutched in a dying hand  --  is a gruesome wraith beneath the surface of the bloodied water . GABRIEL slowly unwinds , the last of the deputies killed . Only one man remains . Section Details STOCKBURN - EXT . MAIN STREET His face inscrutable , implacable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A long moment passes . And then  --  LOW ANGLE - CLOSE SHOT - GABRIEL 'S HAT As before , it reposes in the middle of the street . A beat .  --  126  --  Then Gabriel 's hand comes INTO SHOT and picks it up . CAMERA TILTS UP . Gabriel towers OVER LENS . Replacing the hat on his head he lifts his pistol , flips open the cylinder and shucks his empties in the dusty silence , his eyes on : STOCKBURN - GABRIEL 'S POV SEEN outside Blankenship 's emporium , some fifty yards away . CLOSE SHOT - STOCKBURN His face is suddenly transformed . A grin of raw sardonic evil permeates his eyes . Pulling his pistol from its holster he spins the cylinder to check its loads , then glances back at : GABRIEL - STOCKBURN 'S POV He stands in mid-street , his face shadowed by his hat as he reloads his .44 . FULL OVERHEAD SHOT - STOCKBURN &amp; GABRIEL Both men are motionless . The soft click-click of each shell inserted in Gabriel 's gun is magnified by the utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only SOUND . And ultimately it stops . Gabriel snaps shut the cylinder . He is ready . STOCKBURN slowly crosses to the center of the street . His left hand  --  the one not holding his gun  --  twists and writhes as if to devour itself with psychic famine . Arriving mid-street , he pauses . HIS POV - GABRIEL separated from him by a flat and dusty fifty yards marred only by the lifeless forms of Mather , Grissom , Tucker .  --  127  --  CLOSE ON GABRIEL Like Stockburn , he holds his pistol loosely at his side . Features darkened by the shadow of his hat , he waits . And waits . And waits . . . . . . until : STOCKBURN slowly starts forward , one ritual step at a time . GABRIEL advances toward him . LOW ANGLE - STOCKBURN Moving forward , looming OVER LENS . LOW ANGLE - GABRIEL A silhouette against the silent clouds , he passes OVER CAMERA . Both men appear twelve feet tall . FULL SIDE-ANGLE SHOT as one man ENTERS SHOT FROM EACH SIDE OF FRAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty yards apart . Against the dusty , weathered , soulless false-front stores of Main Street . CLOSE ON STOCKBURN His tension radiates like heat from the embers of hell . CLOSE ON GABRIEL Motionless  --  his face unseen beneath the brim of his hat . STOCKBURN Motionless . And then  --   --  128  --   --  he lifts his gun . But simultaneously : GABRIEL lifts his head  --  and as the sun in all its brilliance illuminates his face  --  STOCKBURN freezes . The LENS SNAPS IN on his face . &nbsp; STOCKBURN ( hushed - horrified ) . . . You . . . ! ! ! ON GABRIEL as CAMERA PUSHES IN on his eyes and he directs at Stockburn the look which had frozen Josh Lahood 's hand on its way to his gun  --  the look which he had turned on Coy Lahood as well . STOCKBURN 'S GUN WAVERS And a desperate pallor suffuses his features as he fires in panic . But in his fatal hesitation  --  GABRIEL raises his gun and fires five times with coruscating speed : a burst of gunfire that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising like a drum-roll or the beat of wings . CLOSE ON STOCKBURN Gabriel 's bullets rip a perfect eight-inch circle pattern in his chest . And before he can fall  --  GABRIEL fires one last shot .  --  129  --  STOCKBURN A perfectly round hole appears in his forehead ; the back of his head blows away and  --   --  he falls . A beat . And then  --  LOW ANGLE - GABRIEL 'S FEET Empty brass clatters to the dust . TILT UP . Gabriel looms OVER LENS , calmly reloads while his eyes never leave  --  STOCKBURN spread-eagle in the dust , face up , his shirt stained scarlet with the circular pattern of Gabriel 's bullets  --  his hands inert and pale and relaxed at last . GABRIEL closes the cylinder , holsters his gun , turns on his heel and  --  amid the crushing silence which envelopes the street  --  walks toward his horse . INT . LAHOOD 'S OFFICE - LAHOOD - DAY Sunlight through the curtain of the office window falls across Lahood 's ashen face as his gaze marks Gabriel 's movement toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Lahood 's right hand . It holds a blue-black Derringer . And as the tiny weapon rises purposively OUT OF SHOT  --  RESUME GABRIEL as he reaches his horse and puts a foot in the stirrup  --   --  pauses . And looks toward : LAHOOD 'S OFFICE WINDOW - HIS POV We SEE the gentle motion of the curtain with the presence  --  130  --  of the man within . GABRIEL Merely looks at it . INSIDE THE OFFICE - LOW ANGLE . . . with its opulent furnishings , its rich Persian rug . Lahood and the window are O.S. A long beat . BLAM ! ! ! A single shot resounds within the office , and the smoking Derringer falls INTO FRAME in MED . F.G . . . . followed by the tyrant 's body . Lahood is dead .
