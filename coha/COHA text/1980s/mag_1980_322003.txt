The risks in a good turn <P> Polk County District Judge Theodore H. Miller had a small problem . He was accidentally locked outside his chambers in Des Moines , Iowa . While a defendant and his attorney patiently waited , Miller summoned the janitor , who tried every trick he knew to unlock the door : a passkey , a credit card , even a small drill . No luck . <P> The waiting attorney , William Kutmus , approached the judge and suggested that perhaps his client , Loren R. Wilson , might be of some assistance . Wilson borrowed a paper clip and a pipe wrench , lined up the tumblers in the lock and in three seconds popped the door open . <P> Amid applause from onlookers , the grateful judge thanked Wilson , took his seat at the bench and promptly sentenced Wilson to a ten-year prison term . His crime : burglarizing a Des Moines laundry . Under Iowa law , the judge said , he had no choice but to impose that sentence . And was Wilson indignant ? " Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't expect anything . "
