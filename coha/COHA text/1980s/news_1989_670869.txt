Studio 4 of Free Rumanian Television , a chamber about 12 feet square with antiquated cameras and black-and-white monitors , has been the real seat of power since Mr. Ceausescu tried to bolt the country on Friday after 24 years of harsh , absolute rule. // Rapt audiences watched again and again as the television studio repeatedly broadcast videotape of the military trial of Mr. Ceausescu and his wife , Elena , and showed the pictures of the executed ruler ' s body . <> <> Politics as Live Drama // The broadcasts are profoundly political acts , calculated to consolidate support for the provisional government , the Council of National Salvation , and to show that further resistance by die-hard security agents is pointless. // Beginning with the poet Murica Dinesco ' s sudden appearance on the air on Friday morning , shouting , " We ' ve won ! We ' ve won ! " the once-soporific state television has become the pivotal instrument and embodiment of the revolution . It has struggled against sniper fire , commando attacks and its own outdated gear to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife were executed , his security police again tried to storm the station .

Like the other workers , she has been living in the station since Friday . " If television falls , the revolution falls , " she said . " That ' s for certain. " // Outside , the blocks of luxurious villas and embassy buildings in the station ' s neighborhood sit empty , bullet-scarred and broken from the fire of the tanks and soldiers who have defended the broadcasting center . Inside , the monitors showed scenes unimaginable in Rumania just a week ago . Among them were people singing Christmas carols. // The tale of Studio 4 reveals much about power in the electronic age .

And in relatively prosperous East Germany , the people for years caught seductive glimpses of a richer society , as depicted on the West German television. // Here , where Rumanian television was once so dull that the schedules for Bulgarian programming , which can be tuned in , are a hot item for smugglers , the new freedom in the rest of the Eastern bloc could be seen on broadcasts from neighboring countries. // " The whole people see changes coming in Eastern Europe , " Sergei Secuescu , a student , said on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bulgaria , from Yugoslavia .

" <> <> Revolution as It Happens // But the impact of television in the last two weeks goes far beyond that level . Viewers have seen the formation and defense of a revolutionary government , often as it happens. // For a week , Rumanians huddled around television sets and watched the demonstrations and gun battles between the army , which is supporting the popular revolution , and the renegade security forces , who propped up the old order . Then they saw the first tentative steps of the provisional government. // In a sense it was like watching live coverage of the storming of the Bastille or the battle of Yorktown , interspersed with debates from the Constitutional Congress . But in this case the focus of the violence and struggle was the television studio itself . Sovereignty , it seemed , was reduced to the ability to convey what was happening just outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security forces loyal to Mr. Ceausescu began their first attacks on the station , a family in the western city of Arad sat spellbound before their television , watching announcers force smiles as gunshots echoed in the studio . Soldiers were battling the security police , or Securitate , in the lobby of the television station . <> <> Soldiers and Announcers // Behind the announcer , a helmeted soldier with a rifle stood watch . Paratroopers who repelled the attack were brought to the studio as heroes . The announcer broadcast an appeal for help. // The television screen showed a panel of revolutionaries sitting around tables draped in red , yellow and blue , the national colors . The panel included a tank driver , two men in suits , one in a denim jacket and a student in a parka and turtleneck . At 3 A.M. , the student was reading from a new broadsheet issued by an angry group of students . He stopped and began singing a song , only to be interrupted by the appearance of one of the country ' s biggest soccer stars. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother of the family watching the televised revolution - she would give only her first name , Ann - said , " We will not sleep tonight " // At another point , the television showed 10 soldiers in a circle with their rifles pointing at the building ' s elevators , fearful that the security police had infilitrated . And in another remarkable segment , the anchorman on the news during much of the Ceausescu era told his audience that he had been forced to lie for years . He apologized and stayed on the air . <> <> ' Heart of the Revolution ' // Mr. Todan , who in earlier times bought and translated the station ' s meager store of foreign films , recalled that on Friday morning , " The first mass movement was for the youngsters to come to the television , and Studio 4 became the heart of the revolution. " // " But in the evening , the shooting started and we called for help , " he said . " Crowds were surrounding the station and thousands of students were sitting under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it was over. " // Perhaps the greatest threat to those inside the station came on Saturday , when security policemen assigned to the television suddenly turned on the workers . Six paratroopers were killed inside the station by knives or silencer-equipped pistols . One of the policemen got into the basement and cut off the electricity , which was restored only 10 minutes before air time. // Besides bullets , the television workers had to worry about their outmoded equipment , sometimes shutting it down to avoid overheating. // " We have no spare parts , " said Mikhail Bucauanu , the technical chief . " We just patch what we have . " " We recently got three new cameras , " he said . " They were only for filming him . " He was referring to the late Mr. Ceausescu , whose activities dominated the few hours a day the television was on the air under the old regime . Now it is on long into the night. // The last few days of broadcasts have been dominated by Christmas programs. // " It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on television , " Mr. Todan said . " Before if it was in a foreign film , and somebody said ' Merry Christmas , ' we had to translate it as ' Happy New Year. ' " // A scrawny Christmas tree , tinsel in its few branches , stood in one corner of Studio 4 this afternoon , behind two peasants wearing knee-high boots , wide leather belts , smocks and high fur hats and carrying huge loaves of bread proclaiming loyalty to the new Government. // The programming also included a speech by the Rev. Laszlo Tokes , the ethnic Hungarian clergyman whose persecution set off the initial protests ; Christmas carols by teen-age girls walking through the snow ; new government decrees calling for military trials and executions of any secret policemen who did not turn themselves in by tomorrow , and the Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra playing " The Flying Dutchman. " // " At Christmas for 17 people , we had just a round of cheese , some crackers and 200 grams of salami , " Mr. Todan said . " The terrorists had infiltrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fantastic Christmas of my life. " //
