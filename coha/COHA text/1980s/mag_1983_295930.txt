MARCEL MARCEAU ON BROADWAY <P> No Beckett , no carrots , almost no gloom , but surreal Acts Without Words nonetheless . Scene : a bare Broadway stage . Standing , center , a man a week shy of 60 but supple as a teenager , lean in tights , innocent in whiteface . <P> The man , Marcel Marceau , making his first Manhattan appearance since 1975 , does not speak . He is Everyman , and his stage is Everywhere . He mimes timeless little stories , occasionally tinged with rueful reflections of contemporary life . He calls a dating service in search of a companion , and is sent a dozen of them , so diversely demanding that he flees his home . <P> Aided by apprentices , the man makes beautiful images . After a banner unfolds to announce THE PICKPOCKET 'S NIGHTMARE , the man stands between two screens , and mystically his arms and hands elongate , detach from his body , swim through air . As the dying light turns them orange like giant goldfish , six hands wriggle , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train rider so jolted he pops his grapes into his seat mate 's mouth , and tears , as a soldier whose trench mate dies in his arms . The man loves symbols . He slides his hands across his face , as if trying on masks . His expression changes quickly , precisely , but never subtly : it is a childlike grin , or a petulant frown , or a quivering rage . In another moment , the man is a sculptor , chiseling a massive imaginary block until it becomes a miniature , a fragment , then dust . Slow fade , then , to emphasize that this is a self-conscious metaphor for the man 's own meticulous , minimal art . - By William A. Henry III
