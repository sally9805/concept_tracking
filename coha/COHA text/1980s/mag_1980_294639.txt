Midland buys into Crocker <P> Since he became chairman of California 's Crocker National Bank six years ago , Thomas Wilcox has been commuting by corporate jet between the bank 's two main offices , in San Francisco and Los Angeles . Now Wilcox may have to fit in another stopover , London . Last week Midland Bank , Britain 's third biggest , announced it was buying 51% of Crocker at a cost of between $815 million and $820 million . This will be the largest takeover ever of a U.S. bank by a foreign one . <P> The union will create a bank with assets of $63 billion , only slightly less than those of Chase Manhattan . The deal will provide Crocker with capital for expansion in California and restore Midland to the inner circle of international banking . The British bank also announced it was spending about $118.5 million to buy 60% of West Germany 's largest private bank , Trinkaus &; Burkhardt . <P> Midland 's takeovers are partly catchupmanship . The bank has been slow to follow the trend to international branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British bankers in bowlers entering the lucrative California market . Since 1968 , Midland 's rivals-Barclays , Lloyds , Standard Chartered and the Royal Bank of Scotland-have all established offices there . <P> The timing of the deal may cause problems . A four-month congressional moratorium on foreign takeovers of U.S. banks expired two weeks before Midland 's action . That ban had been inspired by the wave of foreign acquisitions of U.S. banks , such as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp . ' s purchase of 41% of New York 's Marine Midland . Financiers now are worried that the Crocker deal might push Congress to erect new barriers . Indeed , the General Accounting Office is expected to recommend next month that Congress reinstate the moratorium . That would limit the activities of British banks in the U.S. at a time when the international branches of major American banks are aggressively attacking the United Kingdom market . The British will doubtless argue that any moves to block their development in the U.S. would just not be cricket . ?          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
