They had a wedding in Mayberry last week . Barney Fife ( Don Knotts ) , decked out in his best city-slicker suit , finally walked down the aisle with his longtime heartthrob Thelma Lou . A beaming Andy Taylor ( Andy Griffith ) , Barney 's old friend and ex-boss , was the best man . Even Gomer Pyle ( Jim Nabors ) was on hand to lead the red-robed choir . <P> Barney 's marital status is not the only thing changing in sleepy Mayberry , N.C. Little Opie Taylor ( Ron Howard ) is all grown up now , editing the town newspaper and about to become a father . Gomer , who left Mayberry in 1964 to join the Marines ( and star in his own series , Gomer Pyle  --  USMC ) is back at the old gas station , working alongside his cousin Goober ( George Lindsey ) . And Andy , who married Helen Crump and moved to Ohio 18 years ago , has returned to Mayberry and decided to run for sheriff again . His opponent turns out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomer might put it , Gaw-lee ! <P> The predicament will be resolved to everyone 's heartwarming satisfaction in Return to Mayberry , an NBC movie currently filming northwest of Los Angeles for a planned telecast in April . The film marks a sentimental reunion , not only for fans of the Andy Griffith Show , which ran on CBS from 1960 to 1968 ( when Griffith left , and the show was transmuted into Mayberry R.F.D. ) but for the reassembled cast . " It 's been wonderful seeing all the old friends , " said Nabors , 52 , who now tends a macadamia-nut farm in Maui between occasional singing engagements . " It 's like a family that we all grew up with . " Commented Griffith , 59 , who has appeared in numerous series and TV movies since the Mayberry days : " It 's like we finished the old show on Friday and started this one on Monday . " <P> Return to Mayberry is the latest example of time-warp television : vintage shows that , after a decade or two in rerunland , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grilling witnesses in last December 's Perry Mason Returns . Kung Fu , the early ' 70s hit starring David Carradine as an Eastern mystic in the American West , resurfaced as a CBS movie early in February . Kojak , Peyton Place and I Dream of Jeannie are among the other series that have been resurrected in the past year . <P> The stars of these shows are not always enthusiastic about retreading old ground . Larry Hagman , now the kingpin of Dallas , refused to re-create his old supporting role for NBC 's I Dream of Jeannie : 15 Years Later . Says Star Barbara Eden : " It 's dangerous messing around with something that people really liked , to try to repeat it . " Dangerous , perhaps , but also potentially lucrative . Perry Mason Returns was the top-rated TV movie for all of 1985 ; a follow-up is planned for this spring , and up to three more for next season .
