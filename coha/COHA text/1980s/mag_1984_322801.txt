Reagan 's European trip ends with a show of harmony and a shower of words <P> There was plenty of pomp and cordiality , all part of the now familiar ritual of summitry . Of substance , there was much less to record . Open disharmony was almost unthinkable , leaving little to disturb the elevated camaraderie that dominated three days of meetings as the leaders of the major non-Communist industrialized nations ( the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada ) gathered last week for their tenth annual economic summit meeting . . The sessions at London 's pillared , flag-bedecked Lancaster House were just the kind of success that the host , British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , had hoped they would be . " Blessed is he that expecteth nothing , " she had intoned at a pre-summit press conference . " For he shall not be disappointed . " <P> For Ronald Reagan , that blessed nothing was still quite something . As Thatcher also emphasized , the London meeting was not intended as a " crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic recovery . From Washington 's point of view , the London meeting might have been dubbed the Re-Election Summit . It capped a ten-day presidential tour that began with Reagan 's nostalgic visit to ancestral soil in Ireland and continued with a highly photogenic appearance on the beaches of Normandy for the 40th anniversary of the D-day landings ( see following story ) . <P> Minor political discomforts sprang up along the way , notably a few vociferous objections in Ireland to the Administration 's policies in Central America . But throughout the trip , Reagan stressed the themes that are central to his re-election campaign and that he hoped to impress upon his fellow leaders . Chief among them : that after nearly four years of Reagan 's leadership , the world is firmly headed for " peace and prosperity . " <P> Outside the amiable confines of Lancaster House , there were plenty of international issues to occupy the seven leaders ' attention . One was the Iran-Iraq war , even if the fear of a closure of the Persian Gulf had momentarily abated . The West Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget deficit and rising U.S. interest rates . Privately , all the leaders except Reagan are worried that U.S. economic conditions could abort international economic recovery and add to the dangers posed by the Third World 's towering debt . The West Europeans also had to weigh their actions at the summit carefully in view of this week 's elections for the European Parliament . Above all , there was the deplorable state of East-West relations , epitomized by the Soviet boycott of the Los Angeles Olympics and the surly and frustrated utterances that emerged from the Kremlin almost daily .
