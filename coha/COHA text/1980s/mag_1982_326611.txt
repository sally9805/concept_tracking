A sizzling way to beat high home-heating costs <P> <P> Fed up with heating oil costs that ran to $1,000 a season even in relatively temperate Virginia , Betsy and Bob Smith of Richmond last fall invested $220 in a portable kerosene heater . From the day they turned it on in their split-level home , their average oil consumption for central heating began plunging , down to 77 gal. , vs. 180 to 200 normally . Says Betsy : " It 's working like a dream . It has half paid for itself already . " <P> The Smiths do not regard themselves as members of an elite alternate-energy fraternity , as do many users of airtight wood stoves and expensive solar heating systems . But they are joining a new energy movement . Roughly 3 million Americans will be turning on kerosene heaters in their houses this winter . By 1985 , 8 million to 10 million U.S. households are expected to own kerosene heaters to keep cold out and heating bills down . The new machines do not replace central heating but are used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Distilled mainly from oil but refined also from coal , kerosene was widely used for lighting and to some extent for cooking and heating in 19th century America . It lost favor as a way to heat homes with the spread of natural gas , oil heat and rural electrification in the 1950s . To Americans in their 40s and 50s , the smell of kerosene still stirs Depression-era memories of farmhouse living rooms with linoleum-covered floors and bulky kerosene heaters from Sears or Montgomery Ward in the corner . <P> Kerosene heaters are now among the fastest selling appliances in the U.S. Prices range from about $170 to $300 and up to $800 for very large models . With the heating season half over , the Houst &; Son hardware store in Woodstock , N.Y. , is sold out , and the manager has been told by his supplier that no more units will be forthcoming before spring . In Chicago , Kim Keebler , manager of Littman Bros. , an energy store , says , " We ca n't keep them in stock . Once we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Feeding the market are breathtakingly high central-heating bills . The price of heating oil has gone up more than 100% since 1979 , and the cost of natural gas more than 40% . Although homeowners have been putting in new insulation , more efficient furnaces and caulking around doors and windows , fuel bills keep going up . <P> The new heaters are a far cry from the smelly potburners of old . Low-slung and liftable , they burn kerosene with near perfect efficiency , meaning that nearly all their fuel is converted to heat . An average-size heater putting out enough heat for a medium-size room on a moderately cold day will run for 19 hrs. on about $2 worth of kerosene . <P> The heaters stand free with no flue , although ventilation through an open door or window is recommended . They produce hardly any odor , although new out-of-the-box heaters generate a slight smell of oil and paint that their makers claim disappears after the first tankful of fuel is used up . All models have automatic shutoff devices to guard against fire if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
