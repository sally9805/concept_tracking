In Detroit , the story was less than met the camera 's eye <P> " Gerald Ford will be his selection as his vice-presidential running mate ... They are going to come to this convention hall tonight to appear together on this platform ... to announce that Ford will run with him . " <P> And that 's the way it was , according to Walter Cronkite . At least that 's the way it was at 10:10 Wednesday night . Within 15 minutes , CBS floor correspondents began hearing that the deal was coming unstuck . At 11:54 Dan Rather 's worried voice crackled across the network 's internal radio system . " Tell the anchor booth to be very careful , " he said urgently . " There 's something very strange going on here . " <P> Indeed there was . At that very moment , NBC Correspondent Chris Wallace was walking between the New York and Pennsylvania delegations . He recalled afterward : " One of Reagan 's regional political directors came careening down the aisle , ashen-faced , shouting , ' It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a second source for confirmation and put the story on the air without waiting for a camera . <P> One of the most frenzied nights in the history of television news had come to a curious climax . In the end , the journalists emerged intact , reporting as fast and accurately as they could under the circumstances . Said NBC 's Wallace , 32 , son of CBS 's Mike : " It was one of the most remarkable moments of my life . " Almost forgotten in the euphoria was the fact that the networks had been dead wrong about Ronald Reagan 's ticket mate for hours-and that they were not alone . <P> Thirty-two years after the Chicago Tribune ran its infamous headline proclaiming Thomas E. Dewey the presidential winner over Harry Truman , an early edition of the rival Sun-Times blared : IT 'S REAGAN AND FORD . Both the Associated Press and United Press International swallowed the Ford story-and swallowed their pride later in the night with corrected versions . Eastern radio and television stations using the wire-service reports on their 11 o'clock newscasts got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte ( N.C. ) Observer , the Raleigh ( N.C. ) News &; Observer and the Shreveport ( La . ) Times , all of which had a Reagan-Ford ticket for part of their press runs . <P> The possibility that Ford would join the ticket gained momentum Wednesday morning after Rather reported on CBS radio that Reagan had " indicated to some leading powers in his party that his preference " was the former President . Reports of meetings between Ford and Reagan were aired on the evening news shows . At 7 p.m . Rather went on TV live with the strongest story up to then , saying that Reagan was not going to consider anybody else " until he gets a final , unequivocal , new no from Ford . " Rather took pains to note that his sources did not think Ford would accept .
