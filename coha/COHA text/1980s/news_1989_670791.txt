By appointing Richard Ross co-chairman of the film division of the School of the Arts , Columbia University has ended a nearly three-year search for a successor to Frantisek Daniel as head of its cinema program. // Mr. Ross , a 53-year-old native of New Zealand , has spent the last nine years as professor of film and television and head of the department of film and television at the Royal College of Art , near the Albert Hall in London. // Among the film-making graduates of the institution ' s two-year master ' s program , he said , are the directors Ridley ( " Alien " ) and Tony ( " Top Gun " ) Scott , as well as the visual artists Henry Moore and David Hockney. // Reacting to the announcement of his appointment at Columbia , whose staff includes such eminent film makers as Milos Forman and Brian De Palma , Mr. Ross said : " The faculty here is a very strong one and very distinguished ; and that , combined with the very clear status given to creative writing at Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite an honor. " // Mr. Ross will be joined as co-chairman by Mr. Forman , who has been on leave from that job while filming " Valmont , " his version of the Choderlos de Laclos novel " Les Liaisons Dangereuses . " Mr. Forman served in the same capacity with Mr. Daniel , who left Columbia to become the dean of the School of Cinema and Television at the University of Southern California. // Mr. Ross said he studied literature as an undergraduate in New Zealand , then went to England at the end of 1956 intending to work for six months as a journalist on Fleet Street and ended up by remaining for 18 years before he returned home for a visit. // In the late 1950 ' s , he said , " It became obvious the power of television was going to be increasing steadily . " Mr. Ross worked for news film agencies and then spent 15 years with the BBC , editing the main evening news program , preparing documentaries and coordinating coverage of the United States space program , the last years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal College. // Tracing his path to Columbia , Mr. Ross said he was attending an international film school congress last summer at the invitation of Mr. Daniel when he met Peter Smith , the dean of Columbia ' s School of the Arts , who asked if Mr. Ross would be interested in having his name put before the search committee seeking a successor to Mr. Daniel. // " It didn ' t take me very long to think about it , " Mr. Ross said . The principal appeal , he explained , grew out of his background in journalism . " One of the things I fought hard for at the Royal College was a strong base of screenplay writing , " he said . " I think it ' s one of the differences of institutions like Columbia University and the Royal College . We produce a group of highly skilled , intelligent young people . We have to have such a liaison with the industry that they will be acknowledged as seedbed toward the future industry . The only way we can do that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get rid of the notion that films made by students are student films . They should be profound , elegant and well written. " // Mr. Ross continued : " I believe the job of the faculty is not just to provide inspiration - God knows that ' s important enough - but also to provide an atmosphere in which young people can be courageous : to say the things they want to say , to make mistakes and to turn these mistakes into an advantage. " // As for having a personal taste in movies , Mr. Ross said , " I keep thinking I do , and then it switches . " Mr. Ross mentioned American films and the films of Francois Truffaut . " But in general , " he said , " I reckon when I sit down in a cinema seat , I give the film maker the benefit of the doubt for just having got it on the screen in the first place . " <> <> Like a Blind Samurai // In Hollywood , the busy Australian film maker Phillip Noyce , represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is putting the finishing touches on a new movie starring a Dutch actor as a character inspired by the hero of a long-running Japanese series. // The new movie , for Tri-Star , is titled " Blind Fury . " The Dutch actor is Rutger Hauer . And the hero of the long-running Japanese series is Zatoichi , a blind samurai. // " In the American version , " Mr. Noyce emphasized , " we have taken the character of a bumbling blind man who has , because of his blindness , developed all of his other senses ; and he bumbles his way through life , encountering all sorts of mad and bad obstacles and people along the way. " // " It sounds like an oblique departure for Rutger Hauer , " Mr. Noyce observed . " It is , only in terms of being set in a comedy situation . He ' s still a tough guy when he needs to be . The rest of the time he ' s as soft as fairy floss and always has a smile on his face , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get through the world. " // Mr. Noyce , whose " Newsfront " in 1978 was the first Australian film to be selected for the New York Film Festival , said " Blind Fury " represented something of a departure for himself as well. // " I ' ve made a whole lot of different films , " he said , " starting with ' Newsfront , ' sort of a historical left-wing drama ; then ' Heat Wave , ' which was an urban thriller , again left-leaning ; then the film that played in New York and got terrible reviews , ' Echoes of Paradise ' ; then ' Dead Calm , ' which is a thriller that is meant to give the audience a nervous breakdown in the theater. // " So it seemed like the ' Blind Fury ' project was a wonderful antidote to everything I ' d ever done before . As a film director , you don ' t have much of a life beyond the imaginary life you invent for the screen . So our best friends are the characters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensions running through your films are the tensions running through your dreams . So I just wanted to have some different sorts of dreams. " // Mr. Noyce said " Blind Fury " should be opening in the United States in the autumn . About a year from now , he said , he expects to be in New Guinea , reunited with his team from " Dead Calm , " including the screenwriter Terry Hayes and the actress Nicole Kidman , who is subjected in " Dead Calm " to terror at sea. // The new movie will be a drama set during and just after World War II and dealing with a woman who refuses to believe that her husband was killed in a plane crash in the evacuation of Europeans after the Japanese invasion of New Guinea. // " Blind Fury " is the first film Mr. Noyce has made in the United States . In Australia , he said , " We ' re used to making a film and then seeking distribution . The films often end up on three screens rather than a thousand like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner Brothers . So , he said , besides the thrill of working in Hollywood , he likes " being a part of that distribution machine like an octopus that stretches its tentacles into every corner of the world - to watch that mechanism at its heart , to make a movie and feel it ' s going to find an audience all over the world . " <> <> A Higher Profile // Speaking of movies that made a splash at the New York Film Festival brings up " High Hopes , " a highly praised entry at last year ' s festival , and Ruth Sheen , who stars as Shirley , the wistful live-in girlfriend in Mike Leigh ' s caustic look at life in Thatcherite London. // Miss Sheen acknowledged that as a result of the film , which is still enjoying a commercial run around the United States , " my profile is a lot higher now : a few more people are aware of me. " // Since " High Hopes , " she has appeared in " The Boy Soldier , " a drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role and a television series. // In " The Boy Soldier , " which explores the life of a hospitalized old woman through flashbacks spanning the years between 1910 and the present , Miss Sheen plays a cameo role as a nurse named Janet . Part of the appeal , she said , was " to go and play somebody totally diffferent from the Shirley character. " // " She wasn ' t very nice , Janet , " she continued . " I wouldn ' t like to get stuck with just one type of role . It would be boring . You don ' t stretch yourself. " // Miss Sheen , who grew up in the East End of London , fell early under the spell of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and dreamed of growing up to be a tap dancer . But she acknowledged , " When I was a kid , it wasn ' t the done thing . " So she embarked on life as an office worker instead of performing . " It took me a bit longer to realize that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eleven years ago , at the age of 25 , Miss Sheen began studying drama . And she has no regrets. // " I think it was one of the best things I did , " she said. //
