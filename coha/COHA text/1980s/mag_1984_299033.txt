The 30 alumni and alumnae of Brent School , in the Philippine mountain city of Baguio , were in for some cultural shocks . Having traveled 7,000 or 8,000 miles to celebrate the 75th anniversary of a school most of them had not seen for more than 40 years , they found something quite different from the tight little American island they had once known . <P> The old buildings were still there , still painted cream and green , and pine trees still cover much of the campus . But new buildings accommodate a student body that has more than tripled in size . More than 50 of the students and many of the faculty and staff are Filipinos , a radical departure from the past . Once a week , as required by national law , the entire student body Lines up to witness the raising of the Philippine flag and to sing in Tagalog the national anthem , Pambansang Awit . <P> At an anniversary performance in the school gym , half the musical program consisted of Philippine songs and dances . At the dedication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippine Minister of Education . Responding to him , Headmaster Peter Caleb said , " We are proud to be part of the Republic of the Philippines . " This would never have been said 40 years ago-and only partly because the Republic did not then exist . Although Brent students felt affection for the Filipino houseboys and , indeed , the Filipino people , no one dreamed that any of them might actually enroll . This was an American school in the Philippines , not a Philippine school . <P> The old school was the most determinedly American institution the alumni had ever known . Founded by the Episcopal Church in 1909 , it had not accepted Filipino students before World War II , and no Filipinos were on its faculty . Americans may have prided themselves on a benign colonial policy , but not that benign . Almost all the 100 students used to be Americans , the sons and daughters of Army and Navy officers , Government officials and businessmen who had some how landed in the Philippines . <P> Philippine influences on the school were few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boarders , the school played some Filipino teams in basketball and baseball , and a few native items occasionally invaded the staunchly American menu . Mangoes were popular . Pechay , the odorous Philippine cabbage , was despised . But because students , under the eye of a faculty member at each table , were expected to eat everything on their plates , it was difficult to avoid . One boy , more imaginative and more opposed to pechay than most , went to unusual lengths . Learning that pechay was on the night 's menu , he took a hair from the longest-haired girl in school , worked it into his plate while the teacher was not looking and then pretended to discover it . " Look at this , sir ! " he announced , grasping the end of the hair and then slowly and endlessly drawing it out of the hated vegetable . That night his entire table was excused from having to eat pechay.
