When it comes to spying on its own people , China has revealed a surprising  --  and daunting  --  competence . Few in Beijing paid much attention to the cameras mounted on lampposts , rooftops and entryways along streets foreigners frequent . The SCOOT system , made by a British firm and purchased partly with development aid , was purportedly installed as part of a traffic-control system to count vehicles . The cameras were also secretly counting contacts between foreigners and Chinese , as John Pomfret , the A.P . correspondent expelled last week , found out . The Beijing State Security Bureau documented its charges against him with , among other evidence , photos of Pomfret and a source sitting * in his car outside a Beijing hotel ; apparently the pictures were taken from a rooftop across the street . <P> The automatic cameras possess night vision , which enabled them to record the bloody fighting along the major streets leading to Tiananmen Square . That sharp footage , skillfully edited and played repeatedly on state-run China Central Television , shows only aggressive " counterrevolutionary " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crowd , the editors created televised WANTED posters , complete with telephone numbers for viewers to call to report on the students frozen on the screen . <P> Even more startling was footage from a remote-control camera concealed in the dining room of a Beijing hotel , which was aired with a voice-over implying that the students at the table had been feasting when they were supposed to be fasting . Decipherable dates on the clip showed , however , that the dinner actually took place more than a week after their hunger strike ended . But the Chinese got the point : nothing is secret . <P> Beijing 's agents shocked the West by " stealing " raw footage of a man-on- the-street interview that ABC News had transmitted by satellite to the U.S. Executives at ABC said they did not know how the Chinese obtained the interview , but conceded that surveillance experts could have intercepted the network 's original satellite transmission . ABC 's feeds are now scrambled . <P> Once lulled by the cuddly Communism of Deng Xiaoping , foreigners now take seriously the tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartments ( notably bedrooms ) , offices and cars of foreigners are bugged for sound and outfitted with tiny optical-filament cameras . Chinese security assured one foreign intelligence officer that the accumulation of tapes in a variety of languages was no problem : the agency has plenty of fellow travelers to deliver sophisticated , nuanced translations.
