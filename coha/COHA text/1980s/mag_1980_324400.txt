The generals ' takeover brings relief , and some foreboding <P> The most obvious effect of the military intervention that overthrew the Turkish government of Prime Minister Sleyman Demirel two weeks ago was the widespread sense of relief it produced . After months of rising terrorism by both the extreme left and extreme right , the country allowed itself to settle into a state of unaccustomed relaxation . Civilians waved at tanks rumbling through the streets of Istanbul . Automobile drivers shook hands with soldiers who manned the roadblocks . Storekeepers raised their bombproof shutters for the first time in months , and restaurants began to fill up again in the evenings . Some city dwellers looked far trimmer than usual , simply because they no longer packed pistols inside their coats or waistbands . Ankara 's English-language Turkish Daily News , reflecting the prevailing mood , announced in a banner headline : LIFE BACK TO NORMAL THROUGHOUT TURKEY . <P> Well , almost .

Tens of thousands of workers were ordered to end a nationwide wave of strikes and go back to their jobs . The new government sugared the pill by announcing a 70% wage increase for those who had been in the midst of labor negotiations at the time of the coup . There were soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster of blue-bereted commandos chatted idly outside Istanbul 's Blue Mosque . Otherwise , the armed forces tried to keep discreetly out of sight as much as possible . Along the 300-mile road between Istanbul and Ankara , foreigners found few troops in evidence . Both deposed Prime Minister Demirel and Opposition Leader Blent Ecevit remained under detention at a military resort hotel in Hamzaky , near Gallipoli . They could receive telephone calls but refused to talk politics . Ecevit told one caller : " I 'm sorry , the general in charge here has asked me not to discuss the present situation .
