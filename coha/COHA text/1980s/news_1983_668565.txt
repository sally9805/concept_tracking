When the question of retirement comes up , Joe Morgan breaks into a soft-shoe routine . Eventually , you realize he finds it is impossible to call it quits as long as he continues to be a winner . Morgan , who turned 40 on Sept. 19 , is back in the limelight that has seemingly shined on him through most of his 19-year major league career . Tonight , he will be playing second base for the Phillies , for whom he has been a vital cog in winning a division championship and National League pennant . This will be Morgan ' s fourth appearance in the World Series . Morgan is no longer Mighty Joe , the scourge of the Cincinnati power teams of the 1970s . These days , more people ask him about retirement and his managing aspirations than they do about hitting . But if you ' re asking about experience and what it takes to win against a favored Baltimore team , then Morgan is your man . Morgan may be older and his skills may be somewhat diminished , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after seven years of relative obscurity with the Houston Astros , he found himself in Cincinnati and became one of the irreplaceable parts of the Big Red Machine . There is still violence in his swing , and this year , despite a .230average , he hit 16 home runs , the most he has had since 1977 , when he hit 22 . After 19 years , Morgan still has an air of excitement about him . He still has the smallest glove in baseball , but he has lost little of the range that earned him five Gold Gloves . He made only 17 errors . Having to take over the spot vacated when the Phillies traded All-Star Manny Trillo to Cleveland wouldput a lot of pressure on most players . But it is fair to say that the most relaxed man on the field tonight will be Morgan . And he is still one of baseball ' s most eloquent nonstop talkers . " I ' m not just here because I have a chance to win a third ring , although it would be nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enjoy winning . If I was losing , I wouldn ' t be . " I am a winner . It ' s a proven fact . I won at Cincinnati . I went to Houston ( for a second time ) , we won and made it to the playoffs . I went to San Francisco . They won and almost made it , too . Now , I ' m here and we won here , too . " There were times when people thought Joe Morgan was only a myth . Perhaps that ' s because , at 5-foot-7 , he simply doesn ' t look like a baseball legend . The Reds openly questioned his talents after the 1979 season and eagerly allowed him to go into free agency . But what they failed to correctly judge was the fire burning inside Morgan . Houston and San Francisco made the same mistake in dumping him after he joined them as a free agent . " When I left Cincinnati , I felt I had something to prove to myself , " said Morgan . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played on a Cincinnati team that had great players , and when you ' re with a lot of great players , you never know if it ' s you or them that is carry the team . " Each year , I ask how good I could be in another surrounding . How good can I be with lesser players around me ? Was it the Reds who made Joe Morgan good , or was he good because he was a part of that Reds thing ? It was an intangible thing , but I wanted to find out for myself . I did . I found out that I was all right . " The Phillies might have doubted Morgan ' s leadership ability before September . That ' s when he caught fire and helped carry the team on an 11-game winning streak . To Morgan , the Phillies were always a team that was in the thick of things , despite the fact that he and others were having mediocre years statistically . " To me , " he said , " it was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ' s going on around you and the people around you . It was the same way for the team , which made a lot of changes before September . We were half a game out of first place , and things started going right for me . I ' m the kind of guy who , for a few days , can carry a team . I used to be able to carry a team for a long time . But at my age , I can only carry it for a few days at a time . But that is really what happened for a lot of guys who , like me , began to contribute . It might be me or Mike Schmidt for two to three days ; then Gary Matthews , Joe Lefebvre or the pitching . It was that kind of situation . We never hit for a high average . But we ' re kind of a clutch hitting team . If we get men out there doing something , we pick each other up . " Morgan treats winning as a birthright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Los Angeles , he brought his father to the park and introduced him to everybody , pointing out that it was his father who made the last 19 years possible for him . " Ever since I was a little kid , " he said , " and my father took me to the Oakland Oaks ' games , he would point out what the players did to help their teams win . " It wasn ' t always the batting average , he would say . It was other things you did on the baseball field that could mean as much , if not more . I know a lot of guys who hit .300 this year who didn ' t produce as many runs as I did . " Morgan said he is thrilled to have a shot at another ring . But no matter what happens in the Series , he said nothing can top 1976 . " That ( Reds ) team was the best anybody saw , " he said . " And I ' ll take it against anybody . That team won seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and the Yankees four in a row . No other team has ever done that . If there would have been another team , we ' d have beaten that team four in a row . "
