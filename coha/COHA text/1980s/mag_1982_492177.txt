Speaking Out VIVA FOSTER GRANDPARENTS ! by Nancy Reagan r give a lot of my time A to the Foster Grandparent Program because I really believe in it . Ever since I first observed it at work in the Pacific State Hospital in Pomona , California , in 1967 , when my husband was governor , I have worked to expand this beautiful program . On that first day , I met a boy named George . It was instant love . He held my hand and followed me everywhere throughout the day . When it was time to leave , neither one of us wanted to let go , and we both cried . That was my introduction to the Foster Grandparent Program . I hope as First Lady to be able to bring this program to the attention of every community across the country . The Foster Grandparent Program is an idea that combines older Americans who have love to give with children of special needs who thrive on that love . These children may be mentally or physically handicapped , from broken homes or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest program ever . It 's a wonderful two-way street . So many programs benefit only one side . This one benefits both sides . On the one side , there are the children whose needs are obvious . I 'm talking about severely retarded children . These special children need a tremendous amount of attention and all the love they can get  --  more than any hospital can possibly provide . They are hospitalized because they are emotionally , physically and/or mentally handicapped , sometimes from birth . On the other side , you have the elderly , who are at a point in their lives where their children are grown and have left home . They sometimes feel lonely and unneeded after leading active lives with families and jobs . They have so much to give somebody  --  a great deal of love and a great deal of experience . Plus , they usually have those wonderful traits that only come as one gets older . They are more patient , more tolerant , more aware of little changes in their grandchild . Children always sense this warmth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each gives what the other needs . Recently , I visited St. Ann 's Infant Home in Hyattsville , Maryland , which is a good example of the Foster Grandparent Program . The children at St. Ann 's are placed in the home because , for a variety of reasons , they are not able to live in their own homes . These are children who perhaps have n't had a tremendous amount of parental affection  --  or maybe they have , but for some reason , the attentions have suddenly stopped . For these children to be placed in a strange atmosphere , without the loving , one-on-one attention that the Foster Grandparent Program can provide , would not be ideal . Most institutions are just not able to provide individual attention to every child , but through the Foster Grandparent Program , almost any child can have a grandparent . There are certain requirements , of course , to be a part of the program . Foster Grandparents have to be 60 years or older and have earnings below a certain income level . They are given some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , love is the real motivation . I almost think the Grandparents would do it for nothing , because it means so much to them . What happens between these two groups is a wonderful thing to see . It gives the Grandparents a whole new life , a purpose , a reason for getting up in the morning . They have a new person to care about who wants and needs their love . That child becomes their child . With much pride and love , a Grandparent will say , " I want you to meet my grandson or and I was out traveling with him , I would visit any Foster Grandparent project that happened to be around to see how they were working . even interested the Australian government with the idea on one trip to that country with my husband . One of my last official luncheons in Sacramento was to honor these Grandparents . I continued these visits during campaigns and spoke on the subject every chance I got . As First Lady , l have made the program one of my two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business community and private citizens to become actively involved . I am actively involved in uncovering new ways to expand the program and to seek private financing . Last summer , I visited an English child-care program in London and suggested they incorporate the Foster Grandparent Program into their plans , and I am continuing to work to spread the program across the country . When I first got interested in this program , there were only 63 projects in existence . Since then , it has spread to every state . There are now 233 projects involving more than 18,000 foster grandparents and 54,000 children in 50 states , the District of Columbia , the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico . I would like to see these numbers keep increasing . I am exploring other ways to make this wonderful program known . I was extremely touched when a song was written by composer Joe Raposo and lyricist Hal David , dedicated to me to benefit the Foster Grandparent Program . The lyrics sing a beautifully simple message : " To love a child you start with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes no more than this to love a child . " The song 's title , " To Love a Child , " is the same as a book I am writing about Foster Grandparents that will be published by Bobbs-Merrill this fall . The book will detail 10 or 12 remarkable relationships between Foster Grandparents and their " children . " Profits from my book and the song will go to the Foster Grandparent Program . And what wonderful letters I get ! One woman wrote to me : " You told us we were important , so we sat back and grinned at ourselves , since we were being useful at 60 or 80. - They are reborn . The program has now spread beyond the mentally retarded to the deaf and to juvenile delinquents , so many of whom have never known what a grandparent is . It 's a wonderful program , one of the best I know . And really based on love  --  just love . The love of one human being for another and the desire to help . That 's what life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said life begins when you begin to serve . There are a lot of Grandparents who have discovered this now . I hope there will be many more in the days ahead . signed to a coed group home for young people who have had trouble with the law . The project attempts to improve self-image , self-esteem and self-respect among the youths . Foster Grandparents teach cooking skills , encourage understanding of social ethics and develop one-on-one relationships with the teen-agers . Although the FGP has expanded over the years and has switched from being an HEW responsibility to an ACTION agency program , its purpose remains the same  --  to match low-income persons , aged 60 and older , with children who have special problems or needs . This eans a senior citizen , armed with solid training and lots of love , gives four hours a day to one or two children who might be developmentally disabled , mentally retarded or autistic , emotionally disturbed , abused , neglected or who have a record of law offenses . The largest number of volunteers is in the 70-79 age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The majority are women ( 84.6 percent ) , and 12.4 percent are handicapped . Currently , Grandparents earn a $2 hourly stipend for their 20 hours of service per week and receive transportation to and from their ssignments , an annual physical ' examination , accident and liability insurance coverage and on-the-job hot meals . Some 40 hours ' of preservice orientation are provided , plus four hours of monthly in-service training . The price tag for these working expenses was $48.4 million last year , part of which was paid by state governments . Some 27 ; states provide funds for FGP projects within their boundaries . Although the FGP budget is the largest of the three Older Americans Volunteer Programs , numerous studies have concluded that the benefits far exceed the costs . Although their pay is modest , the Grandparents ' stipends help them become indepen- ' dent citizens who contribute financially as well as socially to the system . The program pays its own way in other areas , too ; hospital staffs concur that their professional time is saved by the presence of Foster Grandparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a Grandparent is able to bring about the early release of a child from an institution . But the bottom line is the personal reward shared by Foster Grandparents and their " grandchildren .
