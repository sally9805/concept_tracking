Again , passengers boarded a jetliner , strapped themselves in and prepared to set course for a holiday resort . Once again , the seat configuration had been modified to hold more passengers . Almost every seat was taken . Beyond a few slender details , the tragedies of British Airtours Flight KT 328 and Japan Air Lines Flight 123 have little in common . But last week 's air disaster at Manchester International Airport , in the north of England , coming just ten days after the crash of the JAL jumbo jet , had a numbingly familiar ring : the reports of panicked passengers screaming for help , a plane with a sound safety record lying twisted and charred . The grim toll of the dead , this time , was 54 . Miraculously , 83 survived the blaze that engulfed the Boeing 737 shortly after an engine exploded during takeoff , forcing the plane back onto the runway . <P> The tragedy was the fourth major air disaster in the past ten weeks , and the third involving a Boeing aircraft . No pattern has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various accidents . Preliminary reports on the Manchester wreck cited an " uncontained engine failure , " meaning an explosion in the plane 's engine , which was built for Boeing by Pratt &; Whitney of East Hartford , Conn . In the case of Air India Flight 182 , which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Irish coast on June 23 , killing all 329 aboard , a bomb is suspected of having caused the 747 to disintegrate in midair . The JAL crash on Aug. 12 , which claimed 520 lives , is still under investigation , but speculation continues that the rear pressure bulkhead cracked in flight . <P> While the precise cause of each of these disasters may never be conclusively established , there is one certainty : 1985 is already the worst year in civil- aviation history , and there are still four months to go . The year has seen 15 air accidents worldwide and a death toll estimated at more than 1,500 , surpassing the previous record , set in all of 1974 , by at least 245 deaths . The bleak performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is raising disturbing issues about flight overcrowding and inattention to safety that could give airlines a bumpy ride in the months ahead . " The ' driver ' is economics , not safety , " Charles Miller , a former safety inspector for the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board , charged last week . <P> The tragedy of Flight KT 328 began shortly after 7:00 a.m . London time . As the 131 passengers settled back in their seats , many were probably thinking of their pending escape from England 's blustery summer for the sunny Greek island of Corfu , the plane 's destination . At 7:07 , the twin-engine jet pulled away from the loading gate and taxied to the northeast end of runway 2406 . <P> In the cockpit , Captain Peter Terrington , 39 , a 19-year veteran of flying , received the all-clear signal from the control tower . As the plane hit 120 m.p.h. , about one-third of the way down the 10,000-ft. runway , the left engine exploded . The blast ruptured fuel tanks and lines , spewing jet fuel throughout the rear passenger section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
