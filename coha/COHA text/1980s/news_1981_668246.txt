If there ' s any question that US Rep. Margaret Heckler ( R- Wellesley ) is thinking of going statewide , it seemed to be answered last week when she chose , during the congressional recess , to make a two-day tour of western Massachusetts , an area that has seen little or nothing of her over her 15-year tenure in Congress . She professes to be interested only in seeking re-election to a ninth term in Congress , that her only reason for the tour of the western region was to " promote tourism . " Nevertheless , she also was making telephone calls this week , asking former aides , whose numbers are legion , whether she should run for governor . She has obviously been assessing the field and is sure that Gov . Edward J. King , the Democratic incumbent , will be challenged by Lt. Gov . Thomas P. O ' Neill 3d , former Gov . Michael S. Dukakis and Atty . Gen. Francis X. Bellotti . What is prompting her statewide interest is the upcoming redistricting of congressional seats . Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reduced to 11 by next year . Since the redistricting scalpel will be wielded by Democratic surgeons , it follows that Mrs. Heckler would be the appendix to be removed . The only other Republican in the state ' s delegation is Rep. Silvio O. Conte of Pittsfield . He is shy now of the new population norm per district ( 521,000 ) by about 30,000 . But it would be difficult to redistrict Conte out of officebecause of geographics . His district now covers at least two-fifths of the land area of Massachusetts . The 50-year-old Mrs. Heckler maintains that her district shouldn ' t be disturbed at all . It now has a population of 523,000 which is just about on target . But State Rep. George Keverian ( D-Everett ) , House majority leader and chief surgeon of the redistricting team , said it ' s not that simple . " It would be one thing if Mrs. Heckler ' s district were out in the Berkshires , " he said this week . " But it ' s quite another thing to be contiguous to districts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only other district that is over the new norm is the 12th , represented by Rep. Gerry Studds , which has a surplus of 63,000 In all likelihood Studds ' home town , Cohasset , which is at the extreme northern end of his district , will have to be excised , but that shouldn ' t have too much of an impact on the liberal Democratic incumbent who has earned the respect of constituents even in the most conservative sections of the district . House Speaker Tip O ' Neill ' s district is shy by 86,000 population . Barney Frank ' s 4th district needs 61,000 more people . Boston Rep. Joseph Moakley and Brian Donnelly are shy by 95,500 and 63,000 respectively . Under those circumstances . Peggy Heckler ' s district just isn ' t going to be kept intact . Neither , says Keverian , can you simplify the problem just by putting the Heckler and Frank districts together in such a way as to reassure the re-election of Democrat Frank . The problem of redistricting is being exacerbated by the refusal of state Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last January , the House passed an order calling for the creation of a commission , but the Senate has never concurred . It has been stashed away in the dockets of Senate rules . In the recently adopted deficiency budget , the Senate knocked out a $25,000 appropriation for redistricting but the item was restored in conference between the two branches . And so Margaret Mary Shaughnessy Heckler is hitting the road looking for maximum visibility . She is being aided by Gov . King ' s acting commissioner of commerce , Ernest Lucci , who has long been in charge of tourist promotion in Massachusetts . He orchestrated the trip to western Massachusetts for her last week . In all instances , including an overnight stay at the expensive Red Lion Inn in Stockbridge , the tabs were picked up by local tourism and business promoters . The biggest such tab , dinner for 18 at the Red Lion plus three rooms overnight , was picked up by the Berkshire Hills Conference , an agency that derives substantial sums from the property taxpayers of Berkshire County . The reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the executive committee of the National Tourist Caucus , which is composed of members of Congress who represent tourist districts . It has no official federal status and is supported entirely by funds from tourist promotion agencies . She is echoing all the cliches of the tourist industry about the economic impact of tourism . Somehow , the impact has grown from $600 million a year to $3 billion in the current year . Apparently everybody who engages a motel or hotel room is a " tourist . " Not many years ago , a $250,000 study of tourism in Massachusetts came up with the amazing discovery that the second busiest tourist area of the state was Worcester County , an area that is honeycombed with small manufacturers that attract salesmen , technicians and other businessmen who fill the hotels and motels . Whether Peggy Heckler can put herself over statewide the way she has in her own district is a serious question . Her record in Congress will get much more of a focus than it does in the 10th District . A. A. Michelson is political editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
