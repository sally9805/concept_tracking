One way to unload 30 million lbs . of processed cheddar cheese <P> Free the cheese ! Consumer groups have been beaming that message at the White House in petitions and telegrams for a month , and last week Ronald Reagan agreed to do just that . In an Oval Office ceremony , during which he signed an $11 billion farm price-support bill , the President announced that the Government will give away 30 million lbs . of surplus cheese to states for distribution to the needy . Explained Reagan : " At a time when American families are under increasing financial pressure , their Government can not sit by and watch millions of pounds of food turn to waste . " <P> As a present to the poor , the free cheese has its drawbacks . Needy recipients will have to scrape mold off some of the cheese , which has been stored in 150 warehouses or limestone caves in 35 states for as long as 18 months . But , insists Merritt Sprague , a commodity supervisor for the Department of Agriculture , " mold does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety in the menu , either : the cheese , stored in 5-lb. loaves , is all processed cheddar , the kind sold in grocery stores as " American cheese . " <P> Giving the cheese away was not all that simple . Government lawyers were afraid that distributing it to people who receive food stamps would be illegal , since one section of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 put severe restrictions on gifts of commodities to them . But Congress in the new farm till specified that the food-stamp law should not interfere with the distribution of surplus commodities . In most states the cheese came too late for a Christmas present , although the first giveaways , in California , Nevada and Texas , were made last Wednesday . More cheese should be on the tables of the poor for New Year 's Eve . <P> <P> The giveaway still leaves the Government holding some 530 million lbs . of cheese-more than 2 lbs . for every man , woman and child in the country-plus 848 million lbs . of nonfat dry milk stored in 50-lb. sacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 68-lb. blocks . Annual storage and handling cost : $43 million . As Reagan noted in signing the farm bill last week , " surpluses will continue to pile up " because the Government must keep on buying dairy products at prices ( $1.4375 per lb. for processed cheddar ) that are currently higher than commercial buyers will pay . Processed cheese presents the biggest storage problem , because it spoils if held too long-beyond a maximum of two years . Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block has taken to waving pieces of moldy cheese during speeches to dramatize the scandal , which has led to the telegrams urging the White House to give cheese to the poor . <P> Other suggestions for disposing of the surplus range from dumping the cheese in the sea to staging **32;6643;TOOLONG parties at warehouses . Reagan hinted last week that more might be given to the needy , and some of the cheese might be sold abroad , at a loss to the Government . The all-too-obvious solution , of course , would be to lower price-support levels until dairy farmers are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercially . But that would be a lot to ask of politicians . The new farm bill actually increases present price-support levels over four years . Meanwhile , the Government is left with a stockpile that is a mess ... oh , all right , no matter how you slice it .
