If Richard Lyng knows anything better than the agricultural business , it is agricultural politics . A native Californian , Lyng , 67 , started his career by taking over his father 's bean-and-seed-processing business in 1949 and doubling profits during the next 18 years . He went on to hold top positions in the agriculture departments of California Governor Ronald Reagan and President Richard Nixon . After a six-year stint as head of the American Meat Institute , he returned to the USDA as Deputy Secretary during Reagan 's first term as President . In Washington he has earned a reputation as a smooth operator who can handle lobbyists , bureaucrats and even Congressmen , with a cool head .
