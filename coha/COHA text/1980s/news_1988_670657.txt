While the rise in the gross national product was less than the fourth quarter ' s 4. 8 percent pace , economists were cheered by its composition . They noted in particular a sizable reduction in companies ' inventories of unsold goods and robust capital spending. // " It ' s the right mix , " David D. Hale , chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago , said of the G.N.P. figures , which measure the total value of goods produced and services rendered . " Things are happening in the way you want. " // // Profits Revised Upward // Inflation remained in check , the savings rate fell slightly and fourth-quarter corporate profits were revised upward. // " It ' s very difficult , barring a catastrophe , to see any scenario that would derail the economy before the election , " said Daniel T. Van Dyke , the Bank of America ' s senior economist. // At a White House briefing , Beryl W. Sprinkel , chairman of the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers , referred to both recession fears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed them as unlikely . " The G.N.P. data released this morning confirms our view that neither outlook is in the cards , " he said. // One of the best items in the report , several economists said , was the surge in business spending . Outlays for producers ' durable equipment jumped at an annual rate of 32. 5 percent after declining by a small amount in the October-December period. // This suggested that companies in the various industries operating at nearly full capacity - including paper , chemicals and textiles - are deciding they need to expand . This , in turn , will tend to reduce inflationary pressures as capacity comes on stream. // Meanwhile , many companies are buying much capital equipment from abroad , aggravating the trade deficit . Indeed , one of the modest negatives in today ' s report was what analysts called only moderate improvement in the trade account . Net exports , after inflation and seasonal adjustment , grew at a $3. 6 billion rate in the first quarter , up $1 billion from the fourth-quarter rate , the Commerce Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real merchandise exports nonetheless were up 22 percent from 1987 levels while imports climbed only 11. 1 percent , Commerce Under Secretary Robert Ortner noted in a statement. // Another item considered somewhat negative today was the fourth straight quarterly decline in consumption of nondurables , the longest fall in this category since World War II . The category contains such items as food , fuel and clothing . One analyst , however , suggested that this might have been the result of faulty statistics. // Real final sales - the G.N.P. less changes in inventories - climbed at a 2. 6 percent rate during the first quarter , considerably faster than the rate of increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the preceding quarter . What is more , when Government purchases of farm products are excluded from both quarters , the rise in final sales was at a 4. 3 percent rate , compared with a small decline in the fourth quarter. // Francis H. Schott , senior vice president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society , said today ' s figures showed the economy to be " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum to generate some price pressures that will raise interest rates later this year. // The inflation data tied to the G.N.P. report , however , remained reassuring . As measured by the fixed-weight index , inflation edged up to a 3. 7 rate in the first quarter , from 3. 6 percent in the preceding period . The implicit price deflator , a less accurate inflation gauge because its composition is constantly changing , declined to a 2. 4 percent rate , from 2. 7 . <> <> Employment Costs Up // The Employment Cost Index , one of the most important indicators of inflationary pressures in the economy , rose 1. 4 percent in the first quarter from last year ' s fourth-quarter level , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported . On the face of it , the increase was a sharp one in an index that measures the total cost of wages and benefits. // Much of the first-quarter rise , however , was a result of higher Social Security taxes and health insurance premiums . Wages alone went up 1 percent - and not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the index by 4. 1 percent for the 12-month period ended last March 31 . By comparison , the index rose 3. 4 percent in the previous 12 months. // " So far , wages have really not gotten into the inflation area , " said A. Gary Shilling , a Wall Street economic consultant. // Purchases of durable goods rose at a $11. 7 billion rate during the first quarter , following a $22. 4 billion decline late last year . Both periods were dominated by automobile sales , the Commerce Department said . Car buyers have become accustomed to waiting for financing or other incentives , causing large swings in the figures. // Today ' s report , which contained few surprises , also showed declines in housing and Federal spending , with the Federal spending falling at a $22. 3 billion rate . Commodity Credit Corporation inventories fell at a $15. 9 billion rate after rising at a $10. 2 billion pace in the fall quarter. // Over all , inventory investment subtracted $2. 6 billion from the first quarter ' s G.N.P. after having added an exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> Slippage in Savings Rate // Reflecting consumers ' stepped-up spending , the savings rate - personal savings as a percent of disposable personal income - eased to 4. 6 percent , from 4. 8 percent in the fall. // The first-quarter G.N.P. increase was at a 4. 7 percent annual rate when measured in current dollars , as opposed to the 2. 3 percent rate , which is calculated in 1982 dollars. // Corporate profits from current production fell at a $1. 9 billion rate in the fourth quarter , to a rate of $313 billion , the Commerce Department also reported . This was $2. 8 billion higher than the initial estimate published last month . PU GNP AGATE //
