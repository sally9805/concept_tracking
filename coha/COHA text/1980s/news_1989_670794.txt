The influence of Marcel Duchamp on Picabia was of course very strong at the time these paintings were executed . Satire and insolence were key words for both the Frenchman Duchamp and his Cuban-born colleague . The two artists had met in Paris in 1911 and both became stars a few years later in the small social constellation that gravitated around Alfred Stieglitz ' s 291 Gallery in New York. // Picabia left New York in 1917 and resided temporarily in Barcelona , where he wrote artfully garbled essays and poems and produced wild pen-and-ink images for " 391 , " a journal that parodied the small newspaper Stieglitz had printed . After the war , Picabia settled in France and displayed his comic-strip pictures at Dadaist events. // But by the mid-1920 ' s , he quarreled with the Dadaists and thereafter Picabia took his art down a path that few people seemed willing to follow . First came the bizarre " Monsters " paintings that he executed between roughly 1923 and 1928 , paintings that present jarring distortions of everyday scenes and images drawn from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // These images of superimposed figures , doodles and landscapes might well have continued to languish in obscurity if not for the enthusiasm they inspired recently in certain painters . One need only visit the display of works by Sigmar Polke now at the Mary Boone Gallery to realize Picabia ' s influence . The transparencies and subsequent works by the artist made strong impressions on David Salle and Julian Schnabel , as well , and it is no surprise to learn that one of the 11 works at Kent Fine Art ' s current exhibition of transparencies belongs to Francesco Clemente. // None of this will come as news to people familiar with the Neo-Expressionists , or to those who visited the show of 29 paintings by Picabia from 1929 to 1949 that was presented at Boone in 1983 . But the Kent presentation , which focuses on the years 1924 to 1932 , may surprise others for whom Picabia had supposedly ceased to be of interest after the mid-1920 ' s. // The transparencies are in many ways startling , which is precisely the effect they were intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only from antique Roman sculpture and from paintings by Rubens , Durer and Titian , but also from the Catalan Romanesque frescoes , with their images of many-eyed beasts , that Picabia had seen during his stay in Barcelona . Sacred and profane , old and new , meandering hieroglyphs and carefully modeled figures are juxtaposed or laid on top of one another like multiple-exposure photographs. // The paintings are generally somber-toned , covered with a coat of varnish that gives them a darkling patina and that serves to evoke the Old Masters . But as with everything by Picabia , the strategy is clearly tongue-in-cheek. // At the time he made the transparencies , the artist was leading the high life in Cannes , but this did not prevent him from castigating Picasso , Braque and several others for what he believed was their selling-out to the market . Picabia ' s use of classical sources is , by contrast with theirs , mischievous and parodistic , arguably not unlike the paintings of the same period by another master of irony , Giorgio de Chirico , whose curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed. // How are we to take , except with a grain of salt , Picabia ' s mock virtuosity in the awkward rendering of St. Sebastian , superimposed over a nude derived from Ingres ? And what are we to make of his clumsily drawn antique male and female figures in " Craccae , " figures that have been placed incongruously before an Egyptian pyramid and obscured by the outlines of faces based on Botticelli ? // No one has ever debunked Rubensesque women more wickedly than Picabia in his " Three Graces , " while the artist ' s wife , from whom he was becoming estranged , receives perhaps the cruelest treatment of all in a sugary portrait of her upturned face surrounded by obscurely gesturing hands. // Sarah Wilson , in an essay for the exhibition ' s catalogue , appropriately rehearses the connections between the transparencies and experiments in photography and film at the time , outlining as well the artist ' s relationship to Surrealism and discussing the notion that these works simulate opium-induced visions . Not everyone will agree with her assessment that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phases of Picabia ' s work . " These are intriuging paintings for their combination of elusiveness and wit , but beauty would seem to be an unintended byproduct . Of course , with Picabia we can never be sure. // Francis Picabia ' s transparencies remain at Kent Fine Art , 41 East 57th Street , through June 3 . <> <> Bryan Hunt <> Blum Helman <> 20 West 57th Street <> Through tomorrow // Bryan Hunt ' s latest drawings are clearly the work of a sculptor for whom even the white spaces on a page represent mass and volume . Yet Mr. Hunt draws not with a heavy or schematic hand but with a light , sinuous touch that makes the images look spontaneous and fleeting . They are full of movement . In the series of large-scale drawings entitled " Precipice , " which are among the best works here , shadows passing across giant , jagged cliffs are merely suggested with a few deft marks and well-placed gray washes . Colors are used sparingly. // In drawings like " Myth III , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Mr. Hunt had begun describing a mountain and suddenly found himself outlining a head , torso and legs . There is something of the Surrealists ' automatism in these works , something reminiscent as well of Robert Moskowitz , in the reliance on positive and negative forms , and echoes of Clyfford Still , in the variety of thick and thin lines . Throughout Mr. Hunt ' s display of landscapes , figures and abstract shapes , quietude and elegance remain preeminent . <> <> ' Nocturnal Visions in Contemporary Painting ' <> Whitney Museum of American Art at Equitable Center <> 787 Seventh Avenue ( at 51st Street ) <> Through June 14 // This collection of 27 paintings by the same number of artists describes what is clearly an effort to inject the traditional field of landscape with a certain Conceptual savvy . Nighttime serves in the work of many of these painters to suggest meaningful mystery , although only occasionally do the results seem convincing. // This rather vague theme of the nocturne has led to the inclusion of artists with disconcertingly divergent concerns . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined efforts by Katherine Bowling and Chris Pfister and Michael Zwack , among others , is to see a shared esthetic . There may be little to connect works by Donald Sultan , Jennifer Bartlett and Mark Innerst , yet each in its own way is affecting . Eric Fischl ' s surreal " Best Western " ( 1983 ) , with its image of a boy playing an ominous game involving oranges and toy cowboys , serves as the exhibition ' s striking keynote . And in April Gornick ' s " One " ( 1986 ) , a seascape where light breaks through dark , low-lying clouds , a visitor can sense most clearly admiration for Romantic painters like Caspar David Friedrich - a reverence that Susan Lubowsky , the exhibition ' s organizer , rightly pinpoints as a distinguishing trait among contemporary American landscapists. //
