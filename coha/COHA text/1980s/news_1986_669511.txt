All this and more raced through our thoughts as the Royal Viking Sky left her moorings in Amsterdam and began our 11-day cruise around the British Isles . Leaving the harbor and entering the canal to the North Sea , we strained to catch a last glimpse of the fluorescent acres of tulips we had enjoyed during our springtime stay in Holland. // Walking the decks in the brisk North Sea air , we anticipated some swells or rolls . As it turned out , however , the fearsome North Sea was a glassy lake for most of our voyage , and the usual drizzly spring weather gave way to clear blue skies and gentle temperatures. // // Sailing into our first port of call , Edinburgh , we were reminded that we were seeing the world as early explorers did - from the deck of a ship . Air travel can ' t duplicate the view of familiar landmarks rising from the sea as you enter a famous port . By the time we docked , the early morning mist was burning off . Once ashore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then walked down High Street to Holyrood House , home of Mary Queen of Scots . After a lunch of Scottish broth and meat pie in the North British Hotel , we spent the rest of a brilliant day browsing through the shops on Princes Street and mingling with the throngs of natives outdoors to catch the first rays of spring in the gardens beneath the castle. // Toward evening we reboarded the Sky and made for open waters . In the morning we awoke to see flocks of white and black sea birds riding the slate-blue waves . On the horizon loomed the Shetland Islands - beige with splotches of new green foliage . This day had dawned crystal clear and crisp. // After anchoring at Lerwick , Scotland , we boarded a coach and drove past peat-lined hills to one of the most remarkable archaeological sites in Britain at Jarlshof . Known as an ancient Celtic site , there are layers of remains of settlements dating from the Bronze Age to the Vikings to later medieval dwellers . Right across from the ruins is Sumburgh Airport . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whereas Sumburgh was one of the busiest heliports in Europe in the past , it has only occasional flights today. // All during the trip , a major sport among passengers was seeking out bargains in local woolen shops . The buying frenzy reached its peak here in stores selling authentic Shetland sweaters. // After leaving the Shetlands we cruised past the Orkney Islands and arrived at the Isle of Skye , where fields of golden-yellow broom painted hillsides dotted with sheep and lambs . A stop at Clan McDonald Center , amid the ruins of Armadale Castle , proved a good introduction to the history of the Scottish clans . The Skye Woolen Mill near Portree offered a wide selection of sweaters and tartans , but Ragamuffin , a store at the tiny port of Armadale , was the real find for imaginative handknits. // As we cruised to the Isle of Man - a sovereign country not part of Britain - we had our only encounter with very rough seas . Our tenders bobbed up and down , buffeted by the heavy surf . Once ashore at the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Victorian resorts along the harbor were shrouded in mist. // Each year Man serves as host to one of the largest motorcycle races in Europe - the ' ' TT . ' ' As we made our way to the Snaefell Mountain Railway , our tour bus traversed much of the course , where bales of hay and markers were being placed . The Isle of Man is a living museum of various forms of transport , from horse-drawn trams to the narrow gauge railway that winds slowly up the island ' s tallest mountain . We rode the railway to the top , but the dense fog and winds during our visit made outdoor sightseeing untenable . We found the small restaurant at the Summit Hotel cheery and hospitable . After returning to the coach and following the race course across the island , we lunched on fresh Manx scallops ( ' ' Queenies ' ' ) served in an Italian sauce with garlic and tomatoes at Ruff ' s Restaurant , owned by Heather and Francesco Ruffini. // As it turned out , the Isle of Man offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cashmeres priced around $40 at the Tynwald Craft Centre. // Our arrival in Dublin was electric . The streets echoed with the richness of Ireland ' s culture and history . We savored the Georgian row houses with their brightly painted doors and gleaming brass knockers . We pored over Viking artifacts in the National Museum , and at Trinity College library we stood in awe before the luminous Book of Kells , a beautiful , ancient Christian text . We stumbled on the Kilkenny Design Shop opposite the college - almost a museum in its own right - and browsed through Irish handcrafts. // Walking the streets once trod by Joyce , Shaw , Yeats , and Synge made us yearn for Irish drama , so we bought tickets at the famed Abbey Theatre for that night ' s performance of ' ' The Drums of Father Ned , ' ' by Sean O ' Casey , a play made all the more relevant by its partisan themes , which drew applause from different factions in the audience. // The restaurant below the theater serves light lunches and snacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pubs in Dublin also offer excellent food , including Irish smoked salmon . Local friends warned us to avoid the famous Joycean pubs , as they were apt to be overcrowded with tourists. // The landscape in Wales ranges from rolling , green farmland to the rocky crags Sir Edmund Hillary climbed to train for Mt . Everest . In one day we visited Bodnant Gardens to see the banks of rare rhododendrons , lunched on fresh , native lamb at the Royal Oak Hotel , and drove by scores of climbers clinging to the gray , windswept rocks of Snowdonia National Park . Wales also offers an array of medieval castles - most of which are still in excellent condition . Caernarvon in the Northwest - site of the investiture of the Prince of Wales - is a maze of turrets , towers , and passageways - ideal for fantasizing about the days of knights and fairmaidens. // On another day at sea - rounding the rugged coast of Cornwall , we were treated to two talks by former Prime Minister Edward Heath , who told of his meetings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , we awoke to find we were entering Southampton ' s vast harbor . With thoughts of the great Cunard liners of an earlier era and romantic voyages as yet unsailed , we ended our journey with mixed feelings. // The Sky and other Royal Viking ships were elongated a few years ago to accommodate more people , so many in fact that passengers no longer develop that spirit of camaraderie that can emerge on smaller ships . The lines of passengers waiting for tenders to carry them ashore can grow long and tedious . But the ship is well maintained , and the public areas retain their uncrowded feeling. // Dining aboard the Sky was , at best , adequate . Although we were cruising the British Isles , the chef had made no special effort to secure native specialities - no clotted cream for teas , for example , and - worst of all - the breakfast kippers were canned ! Although the food was well presented and properly prepared , it was not the gastronomic adventure promised in the brochures. // The itinerary , though , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ireland and visit islands difficult to reach other than by local ferry. // // Practical information // Royal Viking Cruises around the British Isles and to other parts of the world may be booked through a local travel agent. // // //
