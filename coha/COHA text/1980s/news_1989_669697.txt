Nearly 1. 3 million Salvadorans , caught in a self-perpetuating cycle of war and economic despair , will likely vote in Sunday ' s closely contested election , hoping it will bring them a measure of peace and economic recovery. // But diplomats , political analysts , and many voters themselves worry that no matter who wins , this election could hurl El Salvador into an even more vicious period , one that would pose a sticky foreign-policy dilemma for the Bush administration. // ' ' Regardless of the outcome , there will be a sharp deterioration in the situation here , ' ' predicts a European diplomat , despondent over the prospects of ending an eight-year-old civil war that has claimed about 70 , 000 lives . ' ' There ' s a degree of inevitability about what ' s coming. ' ' // // The stakes of such an upturn in violence are high - not just for the long-suffering Salvadoran people , but for the United States as well. // Seeing El Salvador as an important chink in its anti-communist armor , the Reagan administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to help win the war and establish a centrist democratic government. // But Sunday ' s election , while an admirable feat of democracy in the midst of Central America ' s fiercest civil war , only highlights the fact that both US policy goals are far-away dreams - and may be receding even further. // In the past 18 months , fighting has intensified , guerrilla terrorism has spread , right-wing death squads have reemerged , and Army human-rights abuses have risen. // Perhaps the sharpest blow to US policy is the rapid rise - and likely victory - of the ultra-conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance ( ARENA ) , renowned for its past links to death squads. // Most political analysts here favor ARENA candidate Alfredo Cristiani over Fidel Chavez Mena of the ruling Christian Democrat Party - whether with an absolute majority on Sunday or in a run-off election next month. // Such a victory would send a mixed signal on the health of Salvadoran democracy : While the freely working democratic process would transfer power from one party to another , it would give the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the US pinned its entire policy on the moderate political center represented by the Christian Democrats and their leader , President Jose Napoleon Duarte . It even funneled several million dollars to the Duarte campaign to ensure victory over ARENA candidate Roberto D ' Aubuisson , once linked to death squads and still the most popular leader in the party. // While Duarte cobbled together a fragile democracy and a more restrained military , enthusiasm for his government soon dwindled as he failed to end the war or improve the lot of most Salvadorans . Support has been further eroded by his party ' s blatant corruption , infighting , and lack of leadership in the wake of Duarte ' s fight against cancer. // ARENA has marched into the void . The party has scrubbed its image since the early 1980s when its founder , former Army Maj. Roberto D ' Aubuisson , was linked to death squads that littered the streets with up to 800 bodies a month . With the controversial D ' Aubuisson taking a lower profile , ARENA has broadened its support and clamed nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear whether this moderation is a ploy . But it has brought the party to the brink of the presidency in a country desperate for change. // Many Salvadorans are attracted to Cristiani ' s message of economic wealth generating better-paying jobs . Chavez Mena , meanwhile , has had a hard time persuading voters that he can lift them out of a crisis for which his party has been largely responsible . And a new leftist coalition , known as the Democratic Convergence , has promoted the idea of a negotiated settlement , but has been hamstrung by an atmosphere of fear. // The new ARENA has also appealed to some key US Congressmen who have a firm hand on Salvador ' s life-line of US aid . And most importantly , it has persuaded the US Embassy here that it ' s either not necessary - or not worth it - to intervene. // But despite their current hands-off attitude , some US officials - like many other analysts - worry about increased violence whether Arena wins or not. // If ARENA wins , it would then have control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government - as well as most of the country ' s economic interests . Few people believe an ARENA government would risk losing US aid by carrying out repression against leftist sympathizers. // This is the first election since 1972 in which leftist politicians are making an appearance . But there are fears that an ARENA victory would once again renew pressures that might force leftists into exile again. // The danger is that some younger Army officers and paramilitary members of ARENA might be emboldened by the party ' s lock on power and feel unaccountable for their actions . ' ' The problem is that at the local level , D ' Aubuisson continues to have total power , ' ' says leftist politician Jorge Villcorta. // But if ARENA loses , problems could get worse . ARENA already feels the 1984 election was stolen from it . This time , paramilitary groups are forming to guard against defeat . Col. Sigifredo Ochoa , ARENA vice-president of the assembly , has called for a ' ' nationalist guerrilla war ' ' if an ARENA victory is stolen. // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be an insurrection from the right , ' ' says a leftist academic . ' ' There ' s no way that a weak government like the Christian Democrats could actually hold back a furious right hitting the streets. ' ' // Even in the best of cases , the Christian Democrat government would be stalemated by an ARENA-dominated legislature. // But there is a silver lining to the storm clouds . The rebel Farbundo Marti National Liberation Front , even as it tries to make the country ungovernable , has changed its approach . Its January proposal showed it may be willing to make important concessions . In fact , some analysts suggest the guerrillas may be more willing to negotiate with ARENA because any deal with the rightists stands a better chance of being backed by the military. // //
