" All we wish is to see the U.S. play its role in a fair and responsible way " <P> Less than two years ago , during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon , Syria 's air force was decimated and its army routed . Today , thanks to massive rearmament by the Soviet Union , a faltering U.S. foreign policy and above all the adroit leadership of President Hafez Assad , Syria has emerged as the leading powerbroker in the Middle East . Having forced Lebanon to renounce its U.S.-sponsored agreement with Israel , Assad not only scored a major diplomatic triumph but established himself as the man to see for a Middle East settlement . This is even if , in trying to stabilize Lebanon , he may have overreached himself , as the breakup in the reconciliation talks last week suggests . <P> After suffering a serious heart ailment in November , Assad , 53 , has slowly eased back into a normal working day . Three weeks ago he reshuffled his Cabinet , a move that some analysts interpreted as an attempt to balance power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forceful and engaging . In his modest office in Damascus last week , the Syrian President received Time Inc . Editor in Chief Henry Grunwald , TIME Managing Editor Ray Cave and Chief of Correspondents Richard Duncan for the first interview he has granted a U.S. publication since the suicidal bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut last October . He insisted that Syrian forces will not withdraw from Lebanon until asked to do so by a new Lebanese government of reconciliation ( which , of course , would have to be dominated by Syria ) . He clearly still wants American involvement in the region , though mostly to restrain Israel . His recent success does not seem to have made him any more flexible . In tough and uncompromising language , Assad described U.S. policy as totally at odds with reality and hostage of the pro-Israel lobby in America . His remarks , including his scathing comments about U.S. politicians and voters , may shock many Americans , but they aptly illustrate why the problems in the Middle East are so intractable . Excerpts : <P> Q. Mr. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle East ? If so , what should that role be ? <P> A. Certainly there is a role for the U.S. to play in the area . There is also one for the Soviet Union . No reasonable man can ignore the roles of these two superpowers . All that we wish is to see the U.S. play its role in a fair , unbiased and responsible way in accordance with its responsibilities as a superpower . We say this because we always perceive a continued and complete bias by the U.S. toward Israel . This bias , from our point of view , contradicts the interests of American citizens and does not serve the cause of peace . <P> Needless to say , there are tens , even hundreds of examples to prove this . It is enough to say that the U.S. gives Israel about $3 billion a year . This means that each Israeli gets $1,000 a year from the pockets of American citizens . Now you should know that in 90% of Third World countries , per capita income is much less than this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a big part of this money is in the form of sophisticated weapons which in turn are used to kill our citizens and to occupy our land . <P> Q. U.S. aid to Israel is bigger now than it was in 1975 . Have you and other Arab leaders not asked yourselves why this aid increased and why you have not really affected American public opinion ?
