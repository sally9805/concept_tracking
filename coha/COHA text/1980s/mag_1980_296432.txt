CARNIVAL IN ROMANS <P> by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie <P> Braziller ; 426 pages ; $20 <P> French Historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie managed a singular coup last year . His book Montaillou , a painstakingly detailed account of life in a small French town in the Pyrenees at the beginning of the 14th century , became a surprise bestseller . But then , Montaillou was a singular town . The curious beliefs , the robust lives and the sexual proclivities of its townspeople , revealed through the testimony in their subsequent heresy trials , afforded an intriguing peephole into another time . <P> In Carnival in Romans Le Roy Ladurie provides a new aperture-and another compelling view . The place is the small city of Romans in southeastern France . The year is 1580 . France is still recovering from the widespread slaughter of the Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew 's Day Massacre of 1572 ; skirmishes still go on between Catholic and Huguenot . Town and countryside are periodically ravaged by roving bands of brigand soldiers . Class bitterness over increasingly burdensome taxes breaks out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all coils up toward Mardi Gras , culminating in a bloody midnight clash . <P> This is , as Le Roy Ladurie senses , the stuff of old drama with modern resonances . Yet Carnival in Romans is no mere clone of Montaillou : it is a more demanding work-a long day 's journey into light . In that sense it is a braver book . The author dares , for example , to spend the entire second chapter talking about taxes . He can not do otherwise . If sex and its avoidance preoccupied Montaillou , taxes and their avoidance seem to have preoccupied Romans and the countryside around it . <P> There was good reason for concern . The small rural landowner was being squeezed dry . More and more parvenu nobles , exempt from taxes , were buying country property ; the mounting costs of a burgeoning bureaucracy thus fell on fewer and fewer Frenchmen . Petitions for nobles and clergy to share in the tax load went unheard . <P> The townspeople of Romans resented the same fiscal injustice , but theirs was a more complicated grievance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed there . Instead of paying their bills , these unscrupulous city fathers ran up an enormous municipal debt , then lent the city the money they had embezzled - at considerable interest . <P> Fury over finances and helplessness in the face of roving brigands compelled peasant and townsman alike to form " leagues " to advance their common purposes . Armorers did a brisk business in swords , helmets and arquebuses , forerunners of the musket . In February 1579 the drapers of Romans paraded with weapons and elected a burly colleague , Paumier , as their festival chief . He also became the factional leader of angry craftsmen , tradesmen and plowmen . Soon there were two governments in Romans : Paumier and his followers had seized control of the city gates , a vital link to leaguers in the countryside . By the latter part of 1579 , butchers and bakers were defiantly withholding taxes . Daringly and , as it turned out , fatally , Paumier 's faction was also demanding complete restitution of the funds stolen by the town administrators over the previous two decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
