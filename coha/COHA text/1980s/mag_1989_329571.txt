When Robert Simpson tested positive for the AIDS virus last November , medical bills were the least of his worries . As a court reporter , Simpson , 44 , was earning $48,000 a year and was covered by group health insurance . In addition , he had planned ahead by buying three disability policies . Less than a year later , however , he has fallen through the widening cracks in the U.S. medical- care system . Too weak to work , he has lost the insurance coverage from his job ; moreover , he has yet to see a penny from his disability policies , although he filed six months ago . " I 'm just tired of being a victim , " the pale , bushy-haired Simpson says slowly , pausing to gather strength in his San Francisco apartment . <P> Like Simpson , many of those caught up in the spiraling AIDS epidemic are awash in medical expenses they can not afford . And the safety net beneath them has proved less than reassuring . Since the AIDS crisis began in the early 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms  --  has engaged in quiet combat with government agencies over who should foot the bill for the disease , which now afflicts an estimated 44,000 Americans . And the tab is rising . This year the cost for AIDS medical care is expected to be $3.75 billion ; by 1992 that figure is likely to more than double . Whose responsibility is it to pay for AIDS-related care ? And why does American society , on the whole , seem to be shrinking from the task ? <P> No one is rushing in to assume the financial burden . " Everyone is playing duck and cover while trying to shield themselves from the costs , " observes Ronald Brunk of AIDS Benefits Counselors in San Francisco . This year federal and state programs will pay 40% of the bill , with private insurers taking care of another 40% . The remaining 20% falls in the " self pay "  --  often meaning " no pay "  --  category . The most important government program , Medicaid , is available only to impoverished patients . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " spend down " into poverty , demonstrating that they hold assets of less than $2,000 . This low level of federal coverage portends future problems , since the number of people with AIDS continues to rise . " Federal health planners have been acting as if AIDS will go away , " says Congressman Henry Waxman of California . " It wo n't . " <P> The thicket of state insurance laws makes it possible in some cases for private insurers to find ways to keep profits up and payments for AIDS care down . In 1985 one firm , the Great Republic Insurance Co. , even issued an " AIDS profile " to its agents , instructing them to treat differently applications from " single males without dependents that are engaged in occupations that do not require physical exertion . " These applicants were usually denied insurance . While such major insurers as Blue Cross/Blue Shield and the Travelers deny discriminating on the basis of AIDS , others still use information about living arrangements , residences and Zip Codes to try to identify gay or bisexual men at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives companies additional protection against insuring infected individuals who will have high medical costs . As a result , a number of jurisdictions , including Washington and the states of Florida , Maine , Wisconsin and California , have legislatively limited such testing .
