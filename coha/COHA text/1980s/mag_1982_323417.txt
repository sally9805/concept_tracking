Land for Sale <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> It is good to have TIME 'S thorough coverage of the " Land Sale of the Century " Aug. 23 . President Reagan and Interior Secretary James Watt have the courage and understanding to deal with the Government 's tendency to acquire property and hold it long after the federal need for it is gone . <P> <P> John F. Durr Bellevue , Wash . <P> <P> Your story objectively presented both sides of the land controversy . Unfortunately , Secretary Watt 's cavalier treatment of conservationists ' honest concerns has called his motives into question . I doubt that he will ever be trusted to serve what environmentalists perceive to be the best interests of the nation . <P> <P> John W. Garrett Quaker City , Ohio <P> Secretary Watt has provoked a dialogue about long-term goals for our nation . Neither he nor his detractors will ultimately be right on all counts , but the nation will surely benefit from a heightened concern for natural-resource issues . A recommitment to conservation , with both use and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derrick A. Crandall President <P> American Recreation Coalition Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Unlike President Reagan 's errors in handling the economy , which can be corrected after he leaves office , the vandalism of James Watt will be irreparable . <P> <P> Thomas Bernick Dearborn , Mich . <P> <P> Let 's pray your epitaph for American land ( " Going , Going . .. " ) applies instead to Secretary Watt 's Government career . <P> Warren P. Wolfe <P> Aurora , Colo . <P> <P> The small bits of Government-owned land near large urban areas are often this country 's most valuable recreation assets . To sell to a developer a parcel of beachfront property like Fort DeRussy in Honolulu , the last open spot along Waikiki Beach , is not just shortsighted , it is criminal . Such choice pieces of real estate should be recognized as national treasures . <P> Philip J. Abbott San Francisco <P> Your article falsely states that ranchers are dependent on federal land because private land is overgrazed . The reason for the dependency is the patchwork nature of real estate ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie the scattered tracts of private land together . There is no profit in overgrazing . If a steer has to walk 100 yds. to get a mouthful , he is n't going to get fat . My family has been on the same ranch for 93 years . If we had abused the land , we would have had to move long ago . <P> T. Douglas Cooper Casper , Wyo . <P> <P> Lebanon 's Aftermath <P> I am outraged by the criticism heaped on Israel for its advance into Lebanon Aug. 23 . Regrettably , civilians have been killed in this tragic war , but the P.L.O . is equally responsible . Its members in a cowardly and calculating way situated themselves in the middle of a large and defenseless civilian population . The P.L.O . ' s crimes against innocent people , both Lebanese and Israeli , have been conveniently ignored or forgotten . It is the media 's presentation of the war in Lebanon , rather than the war itself , that has clouded Israel 's image in the world 's eyes . <P> Richard S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
