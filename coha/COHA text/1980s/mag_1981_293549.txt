But Democrats demand more details and less " jelly bean talk " <P> <P> The President was elated . " Two to one ? " he asked incredulously at a White House staff meeting last week . " Really ? That 's great ! " His aides had just brought him the results of the first poll of national sentiment since he disclosed his dramatic plan to slash federal spending and taxes . Actually , the Washington Post-ABC News poll found that the margin of public approval for his economic recovery program was by more than 3 to 1 ; 2 to 1 was the ratio by which Americans expect Reagan 's shrinking of Government to bring inflation down quickly . That particular optimism is not shared even by some of Reagan 's economists . <P> Some of the President 's aides were growing a shade cocky over the heady prospects of steamrolling the economic package through Congress . When Senators and Congressmen asked Reagan 's aides how much of his program the President really insists on getting , they replied solemnly , " He has said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't even blink at us . " Even among Democrats on Capitol Hill there is no willingness to oppose the Reagan drive broadly , since they agree with its aims , have no comprehensive alternatives to offer and fear that opposition would be political suicide . So far , the main tactic of resistance has been to support budget and tax cuts in general , while criticizing highly specific points in the Administration 's still unfolding plans . <P> The President did his part last week to keep the sales pressure on . He invited key members of Congress into the Oval Office for 20-minute pep talks , held a cocktail party for a dozen legislators and their wives and spoke with 25 Republicans he is counting on heavily to push his bills . Reagan also threw a party , including a condensed version of the leggy Broadway hit A Chorus Line , for the nation 's Governors and their wives . Thirty-one of the Governors are Democrats , and more than one-third of the budget cuts announced so far by the Administration for fiscal 1982 will curtail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nonetheless , the National Governors ' Conference passed a resolution declaring that the states were prepared to accept budget cuts , but only if they are given time to adjust to the new austerity , that poor people are protected against unfair treatment and that there is no massive shift in tax burdens from Washington to states and cities . The Governors , moreover , said they wanted Washington to assume greater , rather than less responsibility for welfare and Medicaid costs . Overall , however , the Governors were willing to swap tighter-funding limits for greater control over how they spend the money . <P> If Democratic opposition to the program grows , Reagan 's strategists have ready a second-stage sales offensive . That is to target members of Congress who try to block the economic package and to light fires against them in their home districts , coordinated by Lyn Nofziger , Assistant to the President for political affairs . This drive will use mailing lists compiled by the Republican National Committee and by such friendly lobbies as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot dragging by their Congressmen and Senators . <P>
