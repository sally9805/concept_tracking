A CTA executive testified Monday that he lied to the FBI and to a federal grand jury about a meeting with CTA board member Howard Medley because he feared he would lose his job if he told the truth . Lawrence Murphy , manager of the CTA ' s disadvantaged business enterprise department , said that in the first of three meetings , Medley asked him to prepare a report certifying the participation of a minority contractor in a $38 million diesel fuel contract that had been granted to Brian Flisk , chairman of Metropolitan Petroleum . Also attending the meeting with Medley , 61 , in March , 1987 , Murphy testified , were Flisk , the chief supplier on the fuel contract , and Clarence Casey , the owner of Casey Fuels , a minority subcontractor . The testimony came in the federal trial of Medley as prosecutors sought to prove that Medley took a $25 , 000 bribe in return for deflecting criticism of the contract with Metropolitan . Under questioning by assistant U.S. Atty . Joseph Duffy , Murphy testified that shortly after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including minority subcontracting , he was summoned to Medley ' s office . " Mr. Medley asked what did I know about all this business about the minority contract . . . Mr. Medley said he had some of his people look into it , and the minority was participating . He asked me to write something to say the minority was participating , " Murphy testified . The federal government requires participation by minorities in contracts . Murphy said that Flisk then reiterated that Casey was participating in the diesel fuel contract . Medley asked Flisk if he could get some documents to support that participation by Casey , and Flisk responded , " Yes , we can get him something , " Murphy recalled . About a week later , Murphy said he was again summoned to a meeting with Medley and Flisk . He said that Medley handed him some documents and asked him to " take care of the minority business " problem . " I did not understand the documents . . . I didn ' t find anything about Casey . I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy testified . Murphy said there was " nothing in the documents that supported Casey ' s participation . " But when interviewed about Medley by the FBI last March , Murphy said he couldn ' t recall what Medley said at the first meeting , and never mentioned the subsequent meetings . Murphy said he remained silent because " I was afraid that I would lose my job based on the environment there was at the CTA at the time . " It was only last month , Murphy said , that he told Duffy and co-prosecutor Jeffrey Stone about the subsequent meetings and the truth about the first meeting . Under cross examination by Medley ' s attorney , James D. Montgomery , Murphy admitted that he lied even though authorities had shown him evidence that he had failed to report interest income from a certificate of deposit for four years . Stone charged in opening statements of Medley ' s federal trial on bribery and perjury charges , that Medley took the $25 , 000 bribe in April , 1987 , from Flisk to shortcircuit a CTA investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel . Medley ' s attorneys , Montgomery and Edward Genson , have described the $25 , 000 payment as a legitimate " finder ' s fee " in a real estate deal . The government charges that Medley tried to quash the CTA investigation into Metropolitan . The government charges that Metropolitan was falsifying invoices and delivery tickets while at the same time it supplied inferior fuel to the CTA . Flisk , Metropolitan ' s president , Jerry Coppola , and the firm ' s office manager , Kathleen Mitropolous , are scheduled to stand trial Jan. 9 on charges that they conspired to defraud the CTA and Heller Financial Services of $6 million . Metropolitan allegedly borrowed working capital from Heller by pledging its CTA accounts receivables as collateral .
