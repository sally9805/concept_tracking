" I never abandoned the stage , I never left the stage , I only took time , " said Van Cliburn , who had not appeared in a public concert or made a recording in nearly eleven years . It was 2:30 a.m. , Cliburn 's favored hour for interviews , since he usually sleeps from 5 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon . As he talked about his return to the stage that he had never left , he grew increasingly adamant . " I never retired , and I do n't think that classical musicians do . It 's unthinkable . " <P> The legendary pianist , who became a cold war hero by his spectacular victory at the Tchaikovsky International Competition in Moscow in 1958 , reappeared at the Mann Music Center in Philadelphia last week , and it all seemed true . He had not retired . The previous eleven years melted away ; indeed , the previous 31 years melted away . The lanky 6-ft. 4-in. frame had filled out a bit , and the wavy blond hair was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again sailed into the Tchaikovsky Concerto No. 1 in B-Flat Minor , he demonstrated that neither age nor idleness had diminished his extraordinary technique . The thundering octaves still thundered ; the glittering passage-work still glittered . More important , he played this mindlessly beautiful showpiece with a lifetime of love . <P> Understandably so . It was the first concerto he ever learned , at age 12 , under the watchful eye of his mother . It won him first place in a statewide Texas competition . He played it again to win the Leventritt Award in 1954 and again in Moscow . After his ticker-tape parade up Broadway , his debut recording became the first classical disk ever to reach sales of $1 million , and it featured , of course , the dear old Tchaikovsky . <P> Even then , even among admiring critics , there were grumblings about his reluctance to develop a broader repertoire .

He stopped performing in 1978 . " <P> He first thought about stopping in 1974 , when his father died , and then his manager , Sol Hurok . " I adored both of them , " he says . " It was really quite a blow . " And the virtuoso circuit was exhausting . " The life of a musician is the most solitary life . Sometimes I did find it very difficult . " Cliburn never made any sharp break , just gradually stopped accepting new engagements , spent more time visiting friends ( he lives with his mother , Rildia Bee , now 92 ) , composing piano pieces , buying English antiques , presiding over the quadrennial piano competition that bears his name , working out , enjoying himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . And somehow the first year off stretched into eleven . Then what inspired his return to the stage ? " I do n't know , " he says . " I was invited . I think I 'll just ease into the water .
