Each week of last year , the average nonagricultural U.S. worker toiled for exactly 35 hr. 36 min . Because of that effort , America can now claim title to a dubious superlative : world 's shortest work week . <P> That distinction was bestowed last week by the International Labor Organization in its latest study of global work patterns . The news will be cheering to those patriotic dawdlers , clock watchers and absentees who have selflessly dedicated themselves to making the U.S. No. 1 . No longer must Americans play second time clock to the once lackadaisical Belgians ; those benighted strivers had the cheek last year to add half an hour to their average work week , bringing it to 35 hr. 48 min . That was still far less diligent than the hapless Egyptians , whom the I.L.O . calls the world 's longest workers , at 56 hours and counting . Yes , hard work may have built this country , but it never put us in the record books .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
