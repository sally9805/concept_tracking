That was no Tom Cruise playing the President 's son . That was the President 's son . " I thought it would stir things up , " explained Ronald Prescott Reagan . <P> It did .

Her free-spirited half sister Patti Davis , who uses her mother 's maiden name , has had tumultuous but unsuccessful careers in acting and music . She has come out with a novel , Home Front , a thinly disguised autobiography about growing up as the daughter of an actor who becomes Governor of California and then President . The revealing book focuses on the love-hate emotions of a girl toward her detached father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , who never has time to read it because " there are so many other things on my desk .
