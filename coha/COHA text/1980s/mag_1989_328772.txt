Many years ago , there lived an emperor who was so excessively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on them . One day clever swindlers came to town promising to weave him the finest garments . But they never did . Instead , they tricked the emperor into believing himself finely clad as he paraded naked through town . His subjects , afraid to speak out , praised his invisible suit , until a young child finally told the truth : " The emperor has no clothes . " But the emperor marched on . <P>  --  Hans Christian Andersen , The Emperor 's New Clothes <P> Like a preening tom turkey , chest puffed out and tail feathers held high , Marion Barry struts into the auditorium . As the TV lights flash on , he glances up , a smile curling around his puffy face . But the crowd does not smile back . Instead , it quietly studies his imposing 6-ft. 1-in. frame , burdened now by a slight paunch and a balding pate . A hint of disdain darkens some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at this town meeting to discuss safety barriers on a bridge , he acts more like an emperor holding court . Or , some might say , trying to hold his court together . <P> ; Rebellion is in the air . Midway through the debate , an architect blurts out , " Is Marion Barry going to take the heat ? Who calls the shots here ? Nobody else . " A stony silence ensues . Searching for words to cap the crowd 's venom , the mayor hesitates , then answers , " I 'm a heat taker . I 'm of the Truman philosophy . The buck stops at my desk . If you ca n't stand the heat , get out of the kitchen . " <P> Once a man of soaring eloquence , the Barry of 1989 , under fire , can muster only cliches from Harry Truman . His retort reveals the magnitude of his decline after ten years of calling all the shots : he is exhausted , unimaginative , besieged . Yet he has got one thing right : these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ebbing , and he teeters on the brink of a palace coup . <P> What prestige remains he relishes . When he departs from his sumptuous office near the White House , he strides down the hall as if he owns it . Security guards and harried aides tag along as he munches on a bag of junk food . He nods slightly to his lieges , who nervously stand aside . <P> Barry is one of the nation 's most powerful black politicians , overseeing a $4 billion city-government budget and almost 50,000 workers . And although a City Paper columnist dubbed him " Mayor for Life , " a mocking comparison with Haiti 's corrupt Papa Doc Duvalier , Barry , 53 , is no tyrant . He just knows how power works . Says an insider : " He is a consummate and quintessential big-city boss . "
