The big question about Ralph Sampson on the eve of his pro debut last week at the Scope in Norfolk , Va . was : Would the 7 ' 4 " Sampson , whose legs and shoulders were noticeably more muscular  --  the result of an intensive weight-training program  --  than when he was wearing the uniform of the University of Virginia , give indications of becoming as dominant an NBA center as Wilt Chamberlain or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ? Or would Sampson indicate that he 's destined , as his detractors say , to be no more than a glorified power forward in the pros ? // The questioning was a bit premature because this was an early summer all-star game , of the sort that often are pickup affairs at best . Still , its pivotal figure would be Sampson , the most eagerly awaited pro player since Abdul-Jabbar came out of UCLA as Lew Alcindor 14 years ago . Heightening the drama was the fact that the next franchise player was scheduled to tussle with today 's No. 1 center , Philadelphia 's Moses Malone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , the tendinitis in his right knee had flared up . So the 230-pound Sampson instead faced San Antonio 's 7 ' 2 " , 260-pound Artis Gilmore , who 's not exactly a slouch . In 39 minutes against Gilmore and his relief , Chris Engler , Sampson displayed a varied arsenal of jump shots , left-and right-handed hooks and spin moves . He scored 20 points on 10-of-17 shooting and had 15 rebounds . He also showed leadership in sparking his squad of former ACC standouts from 12 points behind a team of NBA players in the fourth quarter to within two . Sampson &amp; Co. ultimately lost 138-133. // On the other hand , there were a number of apparent flaws in Sampson 's game . Gilmore seemed to move Sampson about the court at will . He easily posted up down low en route to scoring 20 points of his own , and , defensively , he used forearm pressure to repeatedly push Sampson out of point-blank range . On one move , Sampson spun into Gilmore and was stopped dead in his tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his problems at the other end of the floor . " You could tell that defense was his weak point , " ' said the 76ers ' Marc Iavaroni , who tutored Sampson for a year while serving as a graduate assistant at Virginia . " You ca n't let Artis get the ball within five feet of the basket like he did , but Ralph will learn . On a scale of one to ten , I 'd say it was about a seven . " // To Sampson himself , that was good enough . " It was my first time against NBA players , " he said after the game . " All I wanted to do was have some fun . " // In the three months since the end of his collegiate career , Sampson had been having anything but fun . Inundated with requests for interviews and questions on his prospects with the Houston Rockets , the team that had won a coin toss to get first crack at him in this week 's NBA draft , Sampson chose to talk to only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his younger sisters , Valerie , 20 , and Joyce , 18 , to thank for his debut . He admitted he was playing in Norfolk to afford his siblings some fun in the sun at nearby Virginia Beach . // Nonetheless , money was still a major consideration in this game . Sampson and his yet-to-be-named representative  --  an early favorite is Tom Collins , Abdul-Jabbar 's man ; another possibility is ProServ , the agency that furnished players for the all-star tour  --  are expected to ask for a contract in the neighborhood of Malone 's king 's ransom . // Of course , there was the risk of injury in the Norfolk game , and even though Sampson was insured for more than a million dollars , the question was why did he play ? Easy : to show his future Houston employers how much he 's worth and to strut his stuff against that old Rocket , Malone . // That was a worthy gamble , but when Malone regretted , the evening threatened to turn into something of a non-event . After a few perfunctory warmup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a massive whirlybird job , but instead clanged the ball off the back of the rim . And it was n't until 8:18 of the opening quarter and after three misses that the crowd got what it paid for , Sampson sinking his first shot , a lefthanded jump hook from the lane over Gilmore. // For much of the game Sampson seemed content to rebound , throw an outlet pass and hang back to admire his handiwork . But late in the game , when Sampson 's critics claimed he used to disappear from Virginia games , he caught fire , igniting the sellout crowd of 10,258 and his teammates . Sampson snuffed a dunk attempt by Gilmore and made an open-court steal . // Then came the pi ? ce de r ? sistance . Taking an outlet pass from the Nets ' Buck Williams at midcourt , Sampson went into a fancy dribble-drive , topping the move off with a double-pumping layup over a wave of defenders that would have made a guard proud . " He 's exceptionally quick , " the Bullets ' Ricky Mahorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen any big man do . " // So why were there still nagging questions ? " I think he 'd make a damned good power forward , but if he plays center he 'll definitely need a tough player alongside him , " said Williams . " He 's not going to be able to do it all alone . " Also , Sampson set up offensively on the left side of the court  --  where he could easily turn for a righthanded hook or dunk  --  fewer than five times . " I hope his work habits are good , " Williams said . " Every night in the NBA someone will be testing him to see what he can do . " // After a short stint in August with Golden State Warriors talent consultant Pete Newell 's summer workout group for pro players in Los Angeles , Sampson should next be seen in the Rockets ' training camp . There , he 'll unquestionably make his presence felt . Said one observer , referring to a Houston substitute center , " I think he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
