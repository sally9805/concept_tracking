But the smorgasbord of available approaches to psychological problems would confuse even the most stable potential client . To someone who is emotionally troubled the staggering number of choices can be paralyzing. // In addition to traditional talk therapies , there are therapies called Jungian , Gestalt , Adlerian , Rogerian , group , reality , cognitive , integrity , drug , sex , family , marital , shock , hypnotic , drama , poetry and primal scream . These have been joined in recent years by biofeedback , behavior modification , orthomolecular psychiatry , rolfing , transactional analysis and bioenergetics , not to mention such lay approaches as ESTing , rebirthing and various " anonymous " self-help groups . " The Psychotherapy Handbook , " edited by Richie Herink ( New American Library , $9. 95 ) , describes more than 250 therapies now in use. // Although there are as many opinions as there are therapists as to which therapy or therapist is best for which client , experts have distilled some useful guidelines . <> Which Therapy ? // Certain approaches to treatment are clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which emphasizes changing actions rather than gaining insight , is of little use to a woman who wants to know why she always chooses men who punish her . She would do far better with a " talk " therapy , such as traditional analysis ( a la Freud , Jung or Adler ) , analytically based psychotherapy ( involving conversations with the therapist ) , or cognitive or group therapy. // By the same token , psychoanalysis , which usually means a commitment to four or five sessions a week for several years , is not appropriate for a patient lacking the time or financial resources or having difficulty verbalizing thoughts and feelings. // Traditional analysis or psychotherapy may help a phobia victim understand the basis for his or her fear , but it would not necessarily eradicate the phobia . Behavior therapy can usually extinguish the phobic response rapidly , though the patient may never understand its origins. // Tension headaches may be relieved by gaining insight into stress reactions , in addition to mak-ing life changes to reduce stress . But the headaches may respond faster to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient learns not to translate stress into a tightening of head muscles . A combination of insight , life changes and mechanical therapy might be the ideal route to permanent relief of stress and its physical and emotional consequences. // Group therapy , with or without individual therapy , can be most helpful for people who think they are alone in their suffering . It is also valuable for those with little self-esteem who believe they have nothing to offer , for their contributions to others in the group are ego-enhancing. // Sometimes criticism or guidance offered by group members is more readily accepted than when it comes from a therapist . However , a group can be very threatening to someone who is overly sensitive to criticism or has difficulty talking with others. // Drug therapy ( psychopharmacology ) is often used as an adjunct to talk or other modes of therapy , especially for patients with severe anxiety or depression . The drugs are primarily intended as short-term aids , not chronic therapies , to alleviate symptoms enough to reduce suffering and make other approaches to therapy more successful. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and for some cases of cyclic depression , a drug called lithium is used indefinitely , presumably to correct a chemical imbalance in the brain . <> Which Therapist ? // The specific therapeutic technique used is often less important than finding the right mix of patient and therapist . The ideal therapist , studies have shown , is warm , empathetic , nonjudgmental and genuine , able to inspire hope and trust in patients . But it is the patient ' s reaction to the therapist that counts the most. // Since the patient has to do far more than half the work in therapy , a congenial relationship is most conducive to success . Psychotherapy is ineffective unless the patient is committed to trying to make it work. // A therapist ' s training , credentials , experience and skill are also important . Along with the vast growth of treatment techniques there has been a vast growth in self-styled therapists , many of whom have had no more training than being a " graduate " of the therapy themselves. // While usually innocuous and occasionally helpful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as EST sometimes unleash powerful emotional forces that destroy emotional stability . Without proper training , the lay therapist is unable to prevent such disasters or assist the victims. // As Elizabeth Ogg points out in her illuminating Public Affairs Pamphlet , " The Psychotherapies Today " ( available for 50 cents from the Public Affairs Committee , 381 Park Avenue South , New York , N.Y. 10016 ) , " there is nothing to stop rank amateurs from setting up as therapists or from founding pseudoschools of their own . " Further , the terms psychoanalyst , psychotherapist and counselor have no legal definition ; anyone can claim to be one . <> Types of Therapists // Fortunately , the major types of professional psychotherapists must qualify for licenses in most states . The wise consumer will ask about the therapist ' s training and licensing before making the first appointment . The main sources of help are these : // Psychiatrists . All medical doctors , they have completed a threeyear residency in psychiatry in addition to four years of medical school and a year of internship. // Psychiatrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other therapists may suggest that the client ' s physician write a prescription ) . But do not assume that because a psychiatrist is a physician , he or she will perform a physical examination or would be more likely to detect a physical cause for emotional symptoms . Ask about a valid state license and certification by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology or board eligibility. // Clinical psychologists . They have doctoral degrees in psychology plus a year of supervised clinical training and should have passed a state licensing examination . Though clinical psychologists are not medical doctors , the care they offer - as is psychiatric care - is accepted for reimbursement under most medical insurance policies. // Psychologists generally charge less than psychiatrists and studies indicate that they are just as effective as psychiatrists . Ask about a state license and certification by the American Board of Examiners in Professional Psychology or a listing in the National Register of Health Service Providers in Psychology. // Social workers . These professionals , who provide more psychotherapy than any other professional group , have master ' s and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals or clinics but some have private practices . Ask about accreditation by the Academy of Certified Social Workers. // Psychiatric nurses . While possessing master ' s degrees , they have no formal type of accreditation . A few are in private practice but most practice in hospitals , community mental-health centers and other agencies. // Psychoanalysts . Though most are either psychiatrists or clinical psychologists who have undergone years of training at accredited psychoanalytic institutes , anyone with little or no training may assume the title . Be sure to check credentials. // Pastoral counselors . Members of the clergy , they have special training in psychology or social work and may have degrees in such fields . They can be highly effective sources of inexpensive counseling , but be wary of those with little or no training in psychotherapy . <> Finding a Therapist // There are many possible sources of referral : your family doctor , your clergyman , a friend or relative who has had a positive personal experience with a particular therapist , the psychiatric department of a nearby university or community hospital , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone book for the Mental Health Association of your county , which maintains an information and referral service. // If immediate assistance is needed , a crisis center hotline may help . Check your phone book under the type of crisis - rape , suicide , drug abuse , etc. // If the cost of therapy is a consideration , treatment given at community mental-health centers , public hospitals and clinics is usually far less expensive than private psychotherapy . Group therapy and treatment given by psychologists , social workers and psychiatric nurses usually costs less than individual therapy by a psychiatrist. // Be wary of a therapist who guarantees success ; psychotherapy is still an art , not a science . And don ' t be impatient if improvement comes slowly or if there are occasional setbacks or plateaus . However , if months go by with no improvement , it may be wise to see another professional , at least as a consultant. // Regardless of whom you choose as a therapist , be sure to ask in advance about fees , frequency of therapy , projected length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check your medical insurance to see if the type of care you are considering is covered. // You might also ask that your first appointment be used as an interview to see if you and the therapist are suited for each other . If you do not like the therapist , do not hesitate to try another . Do not be put off if a therapist suggests that you see someone else who may be better qualified to treat your problem. //
