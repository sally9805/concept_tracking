Classical Music and its Origins , Vol. 1 , The Romantic Era , Vol. 2 // The Nineteenth Century Legacy , Vol. 3 , Music in the Twentieth Century , Vol. 4 // Edited by Michael Raeburn and Alan Kendall , New York and London : // Oxford University Press , Complete set , $195 <> <> HAD the Oxford University Press ' s four-volume ' ' Heritage of Music ' ' failed in all other respects , it would still be worth the price just for the remarkable selection and vivid reproduction of the copious artwork . Happily , though , this is , on just about all counts , an impressively executed undertaking. // Unlike those popular one-volume music-history books that are essentially compact , linear histories of the progress of music in the Western world , ' ' Heritage of Music ' ' is a luxurious guided tour through this history , with generous stops along the way , called ' ' interludes , ' ' to contemplate the giants of music , to explore the progress of such aspects as instruments , the genre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of jazz , the revival of early music , etc . In every way this collection gives a sense of the environment in which the composers and their music functioned. // // The four volumes are neatly divided into the basic eras of Western music , from its roots in ' ' Classical Music and its Origins , ' ' through ' ' The Romantic Era , ' ' on to ' ' The Nineteenth-Century Legacy , ' ' and ending with ' ' Music in the Twentieth Century . ' ' Each is introduced by superb essays that capture the mood of the period discussed . The list of contributors is strong , as are most of the entries . The major figures of the era are thoroughly dealt with ; the lesser ones are grouped together in connective chapters that bridge the time periods between major composers . In each book , important biographical footnotes-in-history are included in a ' ' Biographical Dictionary of Composers ' ' just before the index , which , until the final book , is quite complete. // These volumes are at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explored the way one might explore a great city to really get to know it : The main monuments and streets are there to be appreciated as the achievements they are , and the guided tours are informative and thorough ; yet it is the exploration of the byways and dead-end alleys that give the flavor and character and that are the key to true appreciation. // It is rare in a publication about music that the art of the eras involved is so meaningfully presented as graphic counterpoint to the subject . And yet the art is as much a response to the given era as the music - the former visible and representational , the latter abstract . The volumes invite , even demand , frequent exploration . Eventually , a sense of the continuity of music through at least the middle of this current century can be followed quite clearly. // That continuity begins in the quiet realm of the Roman Catholic Church and ends amid the clangorous high-tech vicissitudes of contemporary life . And though historical artifacts suggest that music came into society as far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know it , began effectively in the 12th century AD , in what has become known as the Notre Dame School , under the aegis first of Leonin and , then , Perotin . They not only composed polyphonic music but used the then-recently devised system of musical notation to tell future performers the pitches and their durations. // Prior to this , notation gave only rudimentary melodic details without meter , meant to serve as memory-prompts to choirs which had been taught the music by their elders . With Leonin and Perotin , however , the notion of repeating a piece of music as it had been conceived entered the Western world . The progression through the Renaissance brought the increasing complexity of rhythm and structure , with a slowly expanding arsenal of instruments. // Once the Catholic church lost its monopoly on artistic impetus to the nobility during the Renaissance , secular music came into its own - gloriously so in the form of the madrigal . And from the madrigal , it was a short step , through the genius of Claudio Monteverdi , into opera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baroque with remarkable vigor , with such luminaries as Johann Sebastian Bach finding his creative outlet in both. // By the Classical era , more music was written for secular presentation than liturgical , because by this time the nobility was being replaced as patron by a growing middle-class of concertgoers and amateur musicians . As the search for increasingly sophisticated ways to express the intangible in music became more probing , more provocative , and more alluring to larger audiences , it forced the further improvement of instruments. // The impact of moving concerts from the court to public halls and opera houses was enormous . The symphony orchestra became a professional ensemble ; itinerant superstar virtuosos became an established fact of musical life ; opera continued to be the rage , moving out of a few major cities into provincial capitals as well . Above all , novelty was in. // Everything had to be new , and composers knew it . So they took advantage of technical progress to challenge themselves to greater heights of inspiration , because the public was their livelihood . The composer staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the music of his colleagues . At some point , the gaze was turned back beyond the customary five-year life-expectancy of a work . In 1829 , Mendelssohn sent shock-waves through Europe with his performance of Bach ' s ' ' St. Matthew Passion , ' ' which introduced this forgotten genius ' s work to the 19th century . Mendelssohn later became the conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra of Leipzig . Franz Liszt was as much a conductor as he was a virtuoso and daring composer , but it was his son-in-law , Richard Wagner , who elevated conducting to a star turn , while at the same time showing audiences , who had all but forgotten , that Beethoven was a musical genius. // From Wagner it was a short hop to Gustav Mahler , the last legendary conductor-composer . He set the highest possible standards of the day in matters of orchestral playing , whether at the Vienna State Opera or at New York ' s Metropolitan Opera or Philharmonic Orchestra . After him , the great conductors were mostly re-creative talents : Those who composed did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries of form and tonality in his massive symphonies , works that his public simply could not understand , which is why he finally declared , ' ' My time will come . ' ' The general public began to appreciate Mahler only in the ' 60s. // In the second decade of the current century , Mahler ' s prize pupil , Arnold Schoenberg , broke with tonality altogether , writing music that only trained musicians could fully understand and appreciate . And here is where the parallel of the artwork in these volumes becomes so fascinating . We are able to see artistic vision shift from the liturgical to the secular , from the lofty and idealistic to the graphically realistic , and eventually to the Impressionist , the Cubist , and beyond. // As the simplicity and faith of the artists became increasingly difficult to sustain in a world moving from rural to urban , from agrarian to industrial , the clear waters of purpose and inspiration became muddied . Simple answers were increasingly difficult to find . As a humanistic approach to life gave way to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragmented , and their answer to this creative dilemma was a self-conscious distancing , a turning to the mechanics of form. // Schoenberg ' s towering influence on this century is just now being fundamentally questioned . And today , where the final volume ends , we remain at a profound crossroads , which ' ' Music in the Twentieth Century ' ' reflects : More attention is given to the likes of Elgar , Vaughan Williams , Rachmaninoff , Janacek , and Kodaly than would have been the case 10 or 20 years ago because , as the century comes to a close , the music world is not so doctrinaire , not so willing to ridicule composers of melody for not deigning to adopt a Schoenbergian serialist ethic. // Today we hear the Elgars and Rachmaninoffs for the remarkable craftsmen they were , while simultaneously allowing ourselves to be intrigued by the mechanistic intricacies of the other path . And today , composers such as John Adams ( who is not even mentioned here ) have finally admitted that communication must be a part of music , if serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen have turned wholeheartedly to the world of electronics to create their often enormous clinical constructs. // Where it will all lead is but one of the unanswerable questions that is beyond the scope or even intention of this ' ' Heritage of Music . ' ' But by presenting its information so lucidly , informatively , effortlessly , in a fashion that can be taken piece by piece , page by page , or in mighty chunks - the choice is up to the reader - we will be in a better position to monitor the future progress of the art form we have come to know as classical music. // //
