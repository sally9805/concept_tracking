Aside from its damaging effects on California 's $14 billion agricultural industry , the most significant thing about this state 's ongoing Mediterra- nean fruit fly infestation is that it can so easily be read ( or misread ) as an agricultural problem caused by an excess of environmental concern . " The lesson of the flies , " said The Wall Street Journal in July , is that " the radical fringe of the environmental movement will not likely again embarrass a politician the way it has embarrassed California Governor Jerry Brown . . . . The environmental radicals have most likely seen their political power peak out and head downward with the Medfly episode . " For The Journal , and for a great many California growers , it was a sort of Silent Spring in reverse , an ecological and economic disaster brought on by a surfeit of woolly-headed environmental concern . At a time when environmental protections are under attack , it 's a lesson that is as dangerous as it is false . The facts , of course , are n't all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Food and Agriculture ( C.D.F.A. ) , which under Brown has become probably the most environmentally sensitive agency of its kind in the country , and the pesticide hawks of the U.S. Department of Agriculture about why a major infestation suddenly erupted in July after the pest was thought to have been all but eradicated in early June . What is certain , however , is that last spring , the C.D.F.A. was confident that the state had brought the medfly situation under control without having to resort to aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion , which has been the heart of this controversy from the beginning and which , since July , has been the major weapon in the fight . It is also certain that the chief defenders of California 's efforts to control the pest without aerial spraying were not " the environmental radicals " to whom The Wall Street Journal referred but people like John Thurman , the San Joaquin Valley dairy farmer who heads the Agriculture Committee of the California Assembly and who has never before been called a radical by anybody . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California program together and ran political interference for it . No one questions the fact that in the six months after the first flies were found in the Santa Clara Valley in June 1980 , the C.D.F.A. 's response was casual and confused . " The whole bunch over there could have screwed up a three-car funeral procession , " Thurman said later . " They stood around wringing their hands like a bunch of old ladies . " The C.D.F.A. set too few traps , analysis of whether the flies that were trapped were sterile was delayed because they were sent to the state 's laboratories by third class mail , and the agency 's field technicians seemed to have no comprehension of the urgency of the problem . Nor is there any question that when the potential seriousness was first suspected , there was disagreement among the experts about the wisdom of aerial spraying , and mounting pressure against it from residents and politicians in the affected areas . Malathion is not Agent Orange or DDT ? it is generally regarded as safe in the concentrations used for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on homes and gardens aroused fear among many people . Resolutions against aerial spraying were passed in several communities , and the state was threatened with lawsuits and worse if it sent helicopters into the area . ( A number of those threats were carried out when the spraying was begun in September ; helicopters have been shot at and several million dollars in lawsuits have already been filed . ) As a practical matter , it was probably pointless to spray during the winter , since the pest lay dormant in the ground . And many experts believed that the medfly could not survive the cool winter climate of the Santa Clara Valley ? although the only evidence to support this belief was one the only explanation for the hundreds of larvae that were turning up in gardens and orchards across a 600-square-mile area . The U.S.D.A. , which was partially responsible for procuring and checking the Peruvian flies , disputes that find- , ing , claiming there is no real evidence that fertile Peruviana flies caused the problem . The lye on the sterile Peruvian flies could have rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the fact that they were the same color as the Peruvian flies did n't prove they were from the Peruvian shipment . In any case , the U.S.D.A. said , the pattern of larval discoveries after June 14 did not coincide as neatly with the release of the Peruvian flies as Scribner claimed . It was , in short , not the flies that failed but the program in which they wereused . The state should have been aerial spraying from the beginning . By early July , it was clear to all  --  including the technical committee  --  that there was no choice but to take to the air . In the warm weather , the flies were multiplying and spreading with awesome speed , and there was no more time to strip and ground spray . It was at this point , nonetheless , that Brown , who had almost nothing to do with the medfly program previously , ordered the C.D.F.A. not to begin aerial spraying . " Subjecting 500,000 people  --  including pregnant women , infants and children  --  to six or more aerial applications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer , effective ground-spray operation , " Brown announced , thereby contradicting not Only the agricultural experts but also his own health officials , all of whom had declared the proposed aerial spraying of malathion to be safe  --  probably safer ; in fact , than the ground spraying that had been going on for the previous six months . c - Within forty-eight hours , the Reagan Administration forced Brown to reverse himself by threatening to quarantine all California produce if aerial spraying were n't begun , thus taking sides in the fight between anti-pesticide doves and pro-pesticide hawks . The doves conjured up the bogey of ultimate environmental weapons ? DDT , coal dust , cotton dust , PCBs , microwaves , X-rays , vinyl chloride and scores of others  --  while the hawks cried , " Spray the bugs ; it 's the on= ly language they understand . " In that sort of confrontation , the fruit fly fight had to go to the hawks , for even if the I.P.M. theory was correct , the Peruvian fly disaster had to be reckoned with in precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned into the long string of pesticide disasters on which dovish fears were so properly founded . Yet until Brown ( and then Reagan ) jumped in , the issue was a narrowly technical one . To the extent it was something else , to the extent that there was a " lesson of the flies , " it was just as much a lesson for the pesticide hawks  --  the growers , the chemical manufacturers , the ag experts who could no longer be believed because their repeated claims that unsafe materials were safe had been proved false  --  as it was for doves like Brown , who exaggerated the health hazards of every technological attempt to control the environment . So far , the important concept on which California 's year-long effort to eradicate the medfly was originally based has not been fully verified , but it has not been refuted either . If the fruit fly infestation represents a major failure attributable to excessive environmental caution , it is almost certainly the first . That may be the most notable Okthing about it .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
