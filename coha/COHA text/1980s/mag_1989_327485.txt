AMERICAN APPETITES by Joyce Carol Oates ; Dutton ; 340 pages ; $18.95 <P> It was not true during the Victorian age , but it is now , in the midst of the Electronic . Given diminishing attention spans , stupendously prolific authors tend to wear out both readers and reviewers . Here is another book by so-and- so , they mutter , and I have n't yet found the time to get through the last two  --  or is it three ? Guilt breeds resentment , which in turn fosters rationalization . Anyone who writes that much must be doing a pretty slapdash job of it . And this impression has led to a distinct tilt in contemporary taste and criticism toward " bleeders , " those who rasp and file their words meticulously before issuing slim volumes at discreet intervals . <P> Joyce Carol Oates , 50 , has done nothing of the sort . For the past two decades she has produced roughly a novel a year , plus numerous collections of short stories , criticism and essays . She has written plays and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This frenetic production has hardly destroyed her reputation ; she is a literary figure of considerable clout , she holds a tenured professorship at Princeton University , and every fall her name is rumored to be on the short list for the Nobel Prize . But there is something of the sideshow about her renown among the general reading public ; she is widely recognized as the woman who turns out all those books , less often as the author of a single , unforgettable narrative .

Ian McCullough is a senior fellow at a rather grandly named think tank , the Institute for Independent Research in the Social Sciences . He specializes in population studies and also edits a prestigious journal on international politics . Glynnis , his wife of 26 years , has compiled two successful cookbooks and is working on a third , an ambitious survey to be called American Appetites ; Regional American Cooking from Alaska to Hawaii . The McCulloughs have a circle of close friends very much like themselves : well educated , well- to-do , well regarded by their professional peers and by one another . They all feel terribly fortunate and sometimes worry about the envy or ill will of the world at large . Glynnis thinks , " Our house is made of glass . . . and our lives are made of glass ; and there is nothing we can do to protect ourselves . "
