Oil prices rebounded from recent declines on U.S. spot and futures markets in response to indications that refiners had sharply reduced their output . As reported previously , the American Petroleum Institute said late Wednesday that for the week ended last Friday , U.S. refiners operated at 83% of capacity , down 4. 6 percentage points from the previous week . The report also showed decreases in domestic crude oil and gasoline stockpiles that many industry analysts said were unexpected . The statistics " gave the market a new lease on life  --  at least for now , " said Nauman Barakat , energy analyst for Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co . , New York . Many analysts and traders don ' t expect the rally to last more than a couple of days , however .

Short-covering fueled the recovery . After the " thrashing " the stock and futures markets took early in the week , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record one-day decline , " It ' s typical to see a technical rebound . Indexes could work a little higher from here , " Mr. Chronowitz said .

Meanwhile , rains in the eastern Corn Belt continued to hinder the wheat harvest there . Corn futures and soybean contracts for delivery after the harvest fell , as excellent growing conditions continued .

Earlier negotiations to set a successor to the agreement , which expires in September , collapsed in March . Delegates from cocoa-consuming nations at the current Geneva , Switzerland , gathering were said to be pleased with the flexibility of producing nations ' attitudes , however , said William O ' Neill , research director for Elders Futures Inc. , formerly Rudolf Wolff Futures Inc . " These are by far the most positive talks , and both sides seem to be making a real effort to come up with an agreement , " he said . Consuming nations are expected to ask that the negotiations be extended beyond today ' s scheduled deadline , and producing nations ' delegates are expected to agree .
