Adroit and resilient , Marcos hits the campaign trail <P> Only six months ago , most observers were preparing to write his political , and possibly even his actual , obituary . But last week found Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos back on center stage , resourceful and resilient as ever . After striding vigorously up to a podium in Manila , he led 50,000 cheering supporters in his official party song ( " Under the new society/ Everybody is equal " ) . Then , once the throbbing disco beat had subsided and the fireworks had faded into the night , the President , 66 , made use of all his well-practiced political stratagems , now eloquently rehearsing the triumphs of his 18-year reign , now spiritedly reviling every member of his opposition . <P> Amid well-orchestrated chants of " We want Ma'am , " First Lady Imelda Marcos also displayed her political savvy . She would , she said , continue to pledge " a life of never-ending service and a heart of never-ending love " to her people , but she would not run for office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though : the next day , in spite of Marcos ' rule against dynasty building , Elder Daughter Imee , 28 , was named a candidate in her father 's home province . <P> Thus did the well-oiled Marcos machine launch the election campaign of its Kilusang Bagong Lipunan ( K.B.L. ) Party . But the elections to be held on May 14 seem unlikely to be conducted in the hollow style to which the island republic is accustomed : for the first time since Marcos declared martial law in 1972 , the Philippines has a free , frank opposition to the government . The shocking , still unresolved assassination of exiled Opposition Leader Benigno ( " Ninoy " ) Aquino last August has succeeded in reawakening a long-silent populace and galvanizing the opposition . Now the anti-Marcos forces have high hopes of increasing the number of seats they hold in the 200-member parliament from 14 to more than 100 . Disturbed by massive public protests , disabled at times by what is widely believed to be a chronic kidney disorder and debilitated by a sick and sagging economy , Marcos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges is his greatest strength . " The man is a counterpuncher , " says a K.B.L. colleague . " He does not plan the future ; he just goes from situation to situation , dividing and conquering . " <P> Indeed , Marcos has managed to ride out the turbulence of the past few months with singular and characteristic adroitness . In the wake of Aquino 's slaying , more than a million citizens took to the streets of Manila , marching on the President 's Malacaang Palace and calling outright for his resignation . But Marcos shrewdly countered their attacks with a string of concessions that were accommodating enough to mute some criticism yet narrow enough to prevent real change .
