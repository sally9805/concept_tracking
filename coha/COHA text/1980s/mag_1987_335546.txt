Is the new era of cheap energy that began early in 1986 already over ? That question arose last week as the price of crude oil on the New York futures markets edged past $20 per bbl. for the first time in 17 months . Industry experts said traders have been jittery about increased conflict in the Persian Gulf region , which supplies 20% of the oil consumed by the Western nations , since the attack on the U.S.S. Stark by an Iraqi plane last month . <P> An increasing supply of crude , however , is likely to drive the price below $20 . The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is now pumping 17 million bbl. a day , well above its official production ceiling of 15.8 million bbl . The consensus of energy forecasters : oil will not return to last year 's $10 trough any time soon , nor will it climb to the $30-plus range that bedeviled consumers in the early 1980s.
