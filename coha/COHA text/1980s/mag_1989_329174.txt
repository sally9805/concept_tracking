The Government has declared total war on illegal drugs . But is it a battle that can ever be won ? No , according to a new book by Ronald K. Siegel , a research psychopharmacologist at the UCLA School of Medicine . In Intoxication : Life in Pursuit of Artificial Paradise ( Dutton ; $19.95 ) , Siegel argues that the war is doomed because it is against man 's own nature . His controversial contention : humanity 's pursuit of happiness through chemicals  --  whether ; caffeine , nicotine , alcohol , opium , marijuana or cocaine  --  is a universal and inescapable fact of life . <P> Siegel , a scientific consultant on the nature of drug addiction to two presidential commissions , the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the World Health Organization , is not the first expert to conclude that the desire to alter one 's state of consciousness is a drive as elemental as hunger , thirst and sex . But he takes the argument a radical step further by proposing that society would be best served if it accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less damaging , nonaddictive substitutes for alcohol and the popular illicit drugs . <P> In an attempt to prove his point , Siegel presents exhaustive evidence of the quest for intoxication throughout history and throughout the animal kingdom . In many cases , humans and animals have shared the same drugs . Hawkmoths , for example , fly erratically after drinking the nectar of datura flowers . The Aztecs used the same plant as a pain-killer , and British soldiers in Jamestown who made a salad of its leaves became intoxicated for eleven days . <P> Siegel admits that today 's drugs of choice , both legal and illegal , are too dangerous and too seductive to be used safely . But he is convinced that nontoxic , nonaddictive drugs can be devised , even though " the research may require the same effort and cost man put forth to go to the moon . " The utopian intoxicants he envisions would provide pleasure or stimulation within limits but would not cause a user to lose control , nor pose any danger of overdose . Such wonder drugs may be years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemists have developed hundreds of new psychoactive compounds that are still waiting to be tested . <P> Siegel 's book may draw spirited attacks from conservatives and skepticism from those who have fought and conquered addictions , but his ideas are respected by drug authorities . Says Dr. Lester Grinspoon , a Harvard psychiatrist and author of several books on drugs : " I have come to the view that humans have a need  --  perhaps even a drive  --  to alter their state of consciousness from time to time . " Pioneer drug researcher Dr. Andrew Weil of the University of Arizona College of Medicine confirms that view : " There is not a shred of hope from history or from cross-cultural studies to suggest that human beings can live without psychoactive substances.
