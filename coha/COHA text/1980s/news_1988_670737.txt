The authorities at the crash scene reported Monday that they had found pieces of a suitcase and wreckage that raised suspicions that a bomb was on the plane . Scotland Yard did not disclose its grounds for suspicion , but American experts said the evidence was probably straightforward . In today ' s edition , The Times of London reported that heat damage to the plastic lining of the plane ' s cargo bay was probably caused by an explosion among the luggage. // Dr. Per Anders Persson , director of the Center for Explosives Technology Research in Socorro , N.M. , said in an interview that the appearance of wreckage created by a bomb might in itself be enough to establish that an explosion had taken place . <> <> Telltale Signs // " To cause the massive damage that airliner underwent , between 10 and 15 kilograms of explosive would have been needed , " or about 22 to 33 pounds , he said . " To get it on the plane a terrorist would need a fair-sized suitcase . Investigators would probably find that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be pockmarked by the blast in a characteristic way , and might have the impressions of softer parts of the suitcase pressed into them by the force of the explosion . If the suitcase had a metal handle it would be deformed in a characteristic way , but it would remain in one piece. " // Combustion products of the explosion could be analyzed , but chemists would have a better chance of identifying small amounts of unexploded blasting agent that might have adhered to the debris , Dr. Persson said. // James C. Ronay , chief of the explosives unit at the scientific analysis section of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , agreed in an interview that the evaluation of crash debris must begin with a microscopic visual inspection of any particles that might have come from a bomb or container . <> <> Two Common Techniques // He said chemical methods would be used in looking for explosive residue. // The two techniques most commonly used in such situations , often in combination , are called chromatography and mass spectrometry . They can detect chemicals at concentrations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the unknown substance is mixed with a gas or a liquid and forced through a tube tightly packed with absorbent material . The largest molecules are stopped by the packing after a short distance , but smaller molecules can pass farther through the packing . Molecules are thereby sorted out by size , an indicator of their chemical identities. // In mass spectrometry , molecules are first ionized - given electric charges - and then accelerated through a magnetic field that tends to deflect their courses . The amount of deflection in the trajectory of a given ion is a measure of its charge and mass , and by regulating the trajectory of an ion an analyst can separate it from all other ions having different charges or masses . Ions derived from explosive molecules can thus be separated , identified and measured . <> <> F.A.A. Evaluating Instruments // Both chromatographs and mass spectrometers have been adapted to detect concealed explosives , and the Federal Aviation Administration is evaluating several such systems. // A patent was granted to a group of scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air from a suitcase or person , ionizes the molecules and measures their charges and masses to spot vapors given off by hidden explosives. // But Dr. Scott A. McLuckey , one of the inventors , said the system was a long way from use at airports. // " It takes a lot of training to use it , " he said , " and at this point , the equipment takes up a lot of room. " // Explosive-detection devices have been placed on the market by several manufacturers , but all of them have drawbacks , he said . Portable gas chromatographs designed for airport security systems may be fairly effective in detecting nitroglycerine-based explosives that evaporate relatively large amounts of vapor into the air. // But these instruments are less successful in detecting TNT , and they are relatively insensitive to common plastic explosives - which can be pressed into thin sheets and concealed under the lining of a suitcase. // Plastic explosives are used in large amounts by the armies of most nations and are easily obtained by terrorist groups . Mr. Ronay of the F.B.I. said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is manufactured in most Soviet bloc countries and is distributed throughout the world . Like the C-4 and other Composition-C plastics used by America ' s armed forces , Semtex is difficult to detect from its vapors. // " However sensitive a sniffing instrument may be , it can not detect any explosive that is hermetically sealed in some impermeable container , " Dr. McLuckey said . Fred Farrar , an F.A.A. spokesman , said Federal agencies are nevertheless evaluating explosive-detection devices that might one day become standard equipment at airports . <> <> The Human Factor // " These devices can detect explosives even in hermetically sealed containers , " Dr. McLuckey said , " but they have two big disadvantages . They can ' t be used on human beings because of the dangerous radiation they emit , and they produce several percent of false alarms . Of the thousands of suitcases loaded on an airliner , several percent false alarms can add up to a lot of suitcases that must be examined by hand. " // If the F.A.A. approves explosives detectors for general airport use , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no human control or judgment required . At present , neither the neutron activation system nor a " sniffer " system that the F.A.A. is investigating is " anywhere near deployment , " he said. // When bombings take place , forensic analysts may often be able to determine the exact type of explosive used , but discovering the origin of the explosive will usually be impossible. // " There was a proposal some years back to compel manufacturers to incorporate identifying chemical tags in their explosives , which could be easily detected even after the explosives were set off , " Dr. Persson said . " But the proposal never came to anything , because it would have been impossible to enforce . It ' s too easy for terrorists to make their own explosives at home. " //
