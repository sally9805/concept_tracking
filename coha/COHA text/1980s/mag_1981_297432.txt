" My idea of a vacation is to rest quietly in the shade of a blond . " <P> - Dick Powell <P> Come September , children return to school , grownups to work , and the brain to the head . Not that the brain actually leaves the head during the summer months ; rather , something happens to it , or on it , like a moon caught in an eccentric orbit between the sun and , say , East Hampton or Bodega Bay . Astronomers know this event either as the " mental equinox " or " cranial eclipse . " It is not serious , causes no permanent damage ; the apparatus is simply altered while the body is on vacation . After Labor Day , when the body stands vertical again , the brain pops back into shape like an inflated cauliflower , proving its recovery by formulating the first white lie of the season : " Had a marvelous time . Marvelous . " Oh , that brain . What a kidder . <P> In fact , of course , no one even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the mind is not itself . All we ever have are the vaguest recollections , preserved for a brief time in their rich excitement before they fade like a tan : <P> Summer Talk " Are these local peaches ?
