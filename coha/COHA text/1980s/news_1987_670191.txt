CLEVELAND  --  Jones Day Reavis &; Pogue is a law partnership  --  one of the country ' s largest  --  but its new offices here look more like an international corporate headquarters . Gone are the dark hallways littered with boxes of legal documents . Gone too are the closed office doors , where lawyers huddled to escape the clacking of secretaries ' typing . The new space is brighter and more open ; even inside offices look out onto an atrium . All documents are carefully coded and stored in a central depository . Computer terminals have replaced yellow legal pads for many lawyers , and secretarial clusters are spread out , so noise is less of a problem . Like the corporate clients they represent , major law firms are discovering they must keep pace with the technological advances changing the face of American business . But few have gone as far as Jones Day in combining advanced technology with advanced office design in the 270 , 000-square-foot space it occupied in July . The 800-lawyer firm ' s intent is not only to streamline operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while sending a message to clients that it is efficient , high-tech and flexible . Though not everyone loves it , signs of technology abound in the two five-story blue-and-green glass buildings . In the international litigation center , for instance , a receptionist switches lights embedded in the ceiling to red from green when opposing lawyers visit  --  a signal that sensitive documents should be tucked away and audible conversations guarded . A yellow light cautions that a non-threatening outsider is on the premises . " This is a world headquarters , and an environment we didn ' t have before , " says Margaret Rodewig , administrator of the firm ' s litigation group . Previously the Cleveland offices were scattered in four buildings , secretaries in some cases sat two floors away from lawyers they worked for , and many lawyers didn ' t even see , much less know , others in the firm . Although perhaps three-quarters of the nation ' s law firms use computers for word-processing , Jones Day goes well beyond that . One data base , for example , stores profiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer can call on lawyers in any of the firm ' s 13 U.S. and foreign branches for help . In a new video control room , the firm uses computer technology to produce on a television monitor such calamities as car and plane crashes . A re-creation of an actual plane crash at Boston ' s airport , complete with " black-box " tape-recorded conversations of the pilot , shows what the pilot saw and how he reacted . Such videos are being used more and more as evidence . There ' s even a mock courtroom with video cameras that can shoot from three angles and play back on a split screen . The technology enables lawyers to rehearse before heading into real court . " I ' ve been wanting something like this for years , " says Patrick F. McCartan , coordinator of the firm ' s litigation group . " You can bring some people to a level they never thought they could achieve . " Not all lawyers , it must be said , are eager to be brought to this level of electronic wonderment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with the neat little offices and long corridors and file drawers . It ' s a factory , " says a lawyer at a competing firm who has toured the new steel-blue carpeted offices . Besides , he adds , " My roll-top desk wouldn ' t fit in . " Other competing lawyers , while impressed with the litigation center and the communications system , wonder whether corporate clients will relish seeing such sumptuous surroundings . " Companies these days are price conscious , " maintains F. Rush McKnight , managing partner of Calfee , Halter &; Griswold , a law firm here that specializes in representing start-up companies . Jones Day is betting that its high-tech offices will enhance efficiency and help lure top law-school graduates to the firm . " Traditionally , Cleveland has been a tough sell to new recruits , especially in competing against Los Angeles or New York , " acknowledges Administrative Partner Ellis McKay . While the firm won ' t disclose how much it spent on its new offices , partners don ' t mind estimating savings . They say the computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% to 20% . " Once you get management functions under control , you can spend more time on cases , " says Mr. McCartan . For instance , Jones Day is combining two computerized systems to allow lawyers to call up on their computer screens not only the status of a case but also such details as which lawyers and paralegals worked on the case , how much the firm has spent in research and on expenses and how much a client has paid . In addition , there ' s a computerized guide to tell a lawyer , for example , what motions to file when a tender offer is made for a client . And the firm keeps computerized testimony and other data about expert witnesses . All of this helps reduce research time and allows lawyers to assess quickly the strength of expert witnesses . With the expanded computer capability , the firm also offers other cost savings to clients with their own in-house legal staffs . For instance , Jones Day and General Motors Corp. , a major client , can tap into each other ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research . Although some Jones Day lawyers still feel that terminals are simply new-fangled typewriters that should be used only by secretaries or clerks , the transition to computers for tasks beyond word-processing has been smooth , many lawyers say . " As the word gets out about how easy they are to use , more and more lawyers are using them , " says Richard P. Layman , an estate planner who says he has cut by a quarter the time spent drafting documents . Mr. Layman stores in his computer hundreds of common paragraphs used in wills and other legal documents , and he calls them up on his monitor as needed when drafting a fresh document . Previously he essentially clipped and pasted together pieces of old documents , then made additions in longhand . The draft would then be sent to the word-processing department and ultimately edited by him . " In the meantime you lost your thought , " he says . Richard W. Pogue , the firm ' s managing partner , has begun using the terminal at his desk , but less fluently than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composing a speech , but then " lost " it and feared it was gone forever . " I was petrified , " he says . The next day , however , his secretary retrieved it . Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
