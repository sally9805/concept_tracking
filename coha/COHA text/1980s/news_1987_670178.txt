Donald Nash murdered four people with a long-barreled pistol in a New York garage in 1982 . But when prosecutors decided to put the cuffs on him , they had him arrested for possession of a stolen van . When that charge fell through , they arrested him for failing to show up for sentencing for a taxi medallion forgery conviction . While Nash served his 60 days for the medallion forgery , prosecutors scrambled to gather evidence and present it to a grand jury . They got the indictment three days before Nash was due to be released . When a TV detective slaps the cuffs on the villain , the credits roll and it ' s Miller time , but as James B. Stewart , a Wall Street Journal reporter , demonstrates in " The Prosecutors : Inside the Offices of the Government ' s Most Powerful Lawyers " ( Simon &; Schuster , 378 pages , $19. 95 ) , most of the excitement in real life takes place between the arrest and the conviction . It is the policy of this page to summarize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal reporters , but I can ' t resist a little consumer advice : If you pick up " The Prosecutors " you had better have a chunk of free time ahead of you . You won ' t be able to put it down . The first thing Donald Nash ' s lawyer did after the indictment was to challenge all of the evidence that had been gathered from the van the police thought had been stolen . " The arrest was totally unfounded , " the defense wrote . " The Nash vehicle was not stolen and the officers used this explanation as a ruse to obtain custody of the defendant and his van . Sham arrests have been universally condemned by the courts . " It seemed possible that a . 22 bullet found inside the van , which had been fired out of the same weapon used in the murders , might be ruled inadmissible . Judges have great latitude in deciding whether to suppress evidence , and persuaded by prosecutor Gregory Waples ' s arguments , the judge in this case dismissed the defense motions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a reduced sentence if Nash would confess to the murders and testify against whoever hired him to commit them . In law school , Mr. Waples believed that confessions of this sort should be prohibited , following the civil libertarian logic that the extraction of confessions often gives rise to violations of civil rights . But as a prosecutor , he had moderated his position . Confessions are frequently the only means of getting a conviction . But a deal wouldn ' t do here , Mr. Waples reasoned , because he could not in good conscience offer a four- or five-time murderer lenient treatment . Besides , he already possessed evidence indicating that the man who ordered the murders was Irwin Margolies , a sleazy diamond merchant who was serving 28 years for fraud . While the Nash trial was proceeding , Margolies told a cell mate , who had been wired for sound as part of a separate investigation , that Nash " wasn ' t the trigger man . " Mr. Waples was faced with a dilemma . Supreme Court rulings dictate that prosecutors must tell defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Waples disclosed Margolies ' s statement , he would blow the separate investigation and place the undercover informant in jeopardy . It wasn ' t until the last day of the prosecution ' s case that Mr. Waples revealed Margolies ' s statement  --  in a closed session with the judge and defense attorney . The defense threw a fit , but again , the judge sided with Mr. Waples , and dismissed the defense ' s mistrial motion . The case against Margolies broke open when Margolies ' s lawyer , Henry Oestericher , cut a deal with Mr. Waples . For immunity , he would tell the whole story . He revealed that because of a leak from a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney ' s office , Margolies learned that a woman in his firm was cooperating with an investigation against him . This was the woman he wanted killed ( Nash also killed three witnesses to the murder , and the woman ' s closest friend ) . As if reports of a deadly leak from a prosecutor weren ' t enough to shock Mr. Waples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who brought Nash and Margolies together . Mr. Oestericher ' s involvement in the murder was only slightly less serious than Margolies ' s , yet in order to add life terms to Margolies ' s 28 years for fraud , Mr. Oestericher was allowed to walk free . This case , the so-called " CBS Murders " case , is only one of six tales that Mr. Stewart tells in " The Prosecutors . " The others include such newsworthy misdoings as insider trading at Morgan Stanley &; Co. , a grandiose tax-shelter scheme , and the official investigation into Edwin Meese ' s finances . Mr. Stewart ' s book has already attracted a great deal of attention because of its highly unflattering portrait of Rudolph Giuliani , the ambitious U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York . Mr. Giuliani seems to lack , to risk understatement , a sensitivity to office politics . But what really seems to rub at his disgruntled underlings is his moral fervor . They are more temperate , and lawyerly . They laud the patrician values of fair play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to politics . Our system demands that prosecutors be part crusader , at the risk of being reckless , and part patrician , at the risk of being bloodless , hypocritical and politically naive . It ' s a tough job.
