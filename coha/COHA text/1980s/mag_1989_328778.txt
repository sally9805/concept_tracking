Those funky singing California raisins may be in for some competition from a new kid on the block : the Craisin . Invented by Ocean Spray , a Craisin is a cranberry that has been dried and sugared to sweeten its tart flavor . The product is innocent enough , but the Craisin name has turned raisin producers sour . California growers , who spent $25 million last year promoting raisins , think Craisin is a rip-off . " If it 's a cranberry , why do n't they call it a cranberry ? " asks Don Martens , a member of the California Raisin Advisory Board . <P> But Ocean Spray , based in Plymouth , Mass. , believes the growers ' fuss is fruitless . It says there will be no confusion between the two products , since labels will read CRAISIN DRIED CRANBERRIES . Craisins will be sold as a snack and as an ingredient in other foods . They can also be found next month in a new Ralston Purina breakfast cereal . But the real question is , Can they sing ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
