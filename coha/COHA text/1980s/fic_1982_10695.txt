" First he wants me to drive , " she said , " and then he criticizes every last little thing about how I do it . He 's so clever ; you do n't know how far his cleverness can extend . I mean , it 's not just math or genetics he knows all about but the most efficient temperature for cooking pot roast , the best way to organize my kitchen  --  everything , all charted out in his mind . When I 'm driving he says , Now , Jennifer , you know full well that three blocks from here is that transit stop where you have to veer left , so what are you doing in the right-hand lane ? You ought to plan ahead more , ' he says . Three blocks ! ' I say . Good grief ! I 'll get to it when I get to it , ' and he says , That 's exactly what your trouble is , Jenny .

I thought he was only like me , you know  --  a careful person ; I always was careful , but now compared to Harley I do n't seem careful at all .

It 's out of the frying pan , into the fire ! The first time Harley kissed me , he had to brush off this bedspread beforehand that we 'd been sitting on . Would n't you think that might have told me something ? Every night now before he goes to sleep he perches on the edge of the bed and brushes off the soles of his feet . These bare white feet , untouched ... what could have dirtied them ? He wears shoes every waking moment and slippers if he takes one step in the night . But no ,  |p101there  he sits , so methodical , so exact , everything in its proper sequence , brush-brush . . . sometimes I think I 'll hit him .

She wished she had n't talked so much . When they reached home , therefore  --  where their mother had just arrived herself  --  Jenny said nothing at all about Harley . ( Pearl thought Harley was wonderful , admirable  --  maybe not so easy to hold a conversation with but the perfect person to marry her daughter . ) " Now tell me , " Pearl said when she 'd kissed her . " How come you did n't bring that husband of yours ? You have n't had some silly kind of quarrel . " " No , no . It 's only my work . The strain of work , " Jenny said . " I wanted to come and rest , and Harley could n't leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed restful , suddenly . After Ezra left for Scarlatti 's , her mother led Jenny to the kitchen and brewed her a cup of tea . One thing Pearl never skimped on was tea . She moved around the room , heating the speckled brown teapot , humming some old , wavery hymn . The damp weather had frizzed her hair into little corkscrews and the steam had turned her cheeks pink ; she looked almost pretty . ( What kind of a marriage had she had ? Something must have gone terribly wrong with it , but Jenny could n't help imagining it as perfect , all of a piece , her parents permanently joined . That her father had left was only a fluke  --  some misunderstanding still not cleared up . ) " I thought we 'd have a very light supper , " said her mother . " Maybe a salad or something . " " That would be fine , " Jenny said . " Something plain and simple . "  |p102Plain  and simple was just what Jenny needed . She loosened ; she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew exactly who she was and loved her anyhow . So it was all the odder that after supper , touring the house , she felt a flash of pity for Ezra when she looked in upon his room . Still here ! she thought , seeing his boyish tartan blanket on the bed , his worn recorder on the windowsill , the stamped metal tray on his bureau heaped with ancient , green-tinged pennies . How can he bear it ? she wondered , and she went back down the stairs , shaking her head and marveling . This was what Jenny had brought with her : a change of clothes , her anatomy textbook , Harley 's letter proposing marriage , and his photo in a sterling silver frame . Unpacking , she set the photo firmly on her desk and examined it . She had brought it not for sentimental reasons but because she planned to think Harley over , to sum him up , and she did n't want distance to alter her judgment . She foresaw that she might be so misguided as to miss him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a stiff and stodgy man ; you could see it in the thickened line of his jaw and in the opaque , bespectacled gaze he directed at the camera . He disapproved of her reasoning methods  --  too rushed and haphazard , he said . He did n't like her chattery friends . He thought her clothes lacked style . He criticized her table manners . " Twenty-five chews per bite , " he would tell her . " That 's my advice . Not only is it more healthful , but you 'll find yourselfnot eating so much . " He was obsessed by the fear that she might grow fat . Since Jenny could count every one of her ribs , she wondered if he had a kind of mad spot  --  if he were insane not through and through , but in one isolated area . It was the uncontrollability he feared , perhaps : he would not like to see Jenny ballooning , the pounds collecting unrestrained ; he would n't like to see her getting out of hand . That must be it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . She started stepping on the scales every morning . She stood in front of the full-length mirror , sucking in her stomach . Wasp103it possible her hips were widening ? Out in public , though , she noticed that the fleshy women were the ones who caught Harley'seye  --  the burgeoning and dimpled ones , blondes , a little blowzy . It was a mystery , really . Jenny 's grades were not very good . She was n't failing , or anything like that ; but neither was she making A 's , and her lab work was often slipshod . Sometimes it seemed to her that she 'd been hollow , all these years , and was finally caving in on herself . They 'd found her out : at heart , there was nothing to her . Packing for this trip ( which Harley saw as a waste of time and money ) , she had strode across the bedroom to where his photo sat on the bureau . Harley was standing in front of it . " Move , please , " she told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he saw what she wanted , his face had .. . well , flown open , you might say . His glare had softened , his lips had parted to speak . He was touched . And she was touched that he was touched . Nothing was ever simple ; there were alwaysthese complications . But what he said was , " I do n't understand you . Your mother has frightened and mistreated you all your life , and now you want to visit her for no apparent reason . " Probably what he was saying was " Please do n't go . " You had to be a trained decoder to read the man . She shook open his letter of proposal . See how he had dated it : 18 July , 1957  --  a form that struck her as pretentious , unless of course he happened to be English . She wondered how she could have overlooked the pompous language , the American courtship ( as if his superior intelligence placed him on a whole separate continent ) , and most of all , the letter itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project of marriage like a corporation merger . Well , she had overlooked it . She 'd chosen not to see . She knew she had acted deviously in this whole business  --  making up her mind to win him , marrying him for practical reasons . She had calculated , was what it was . But she felt the punishment was greater than the crime . It was n't such a terrible crime . She 'd had no idea ( would any unmarried person ? ) what a serious business she was playing with , how long it lasts , how deep it goes . Andp104now look : the joke was on her . Having got what she was after , she found it was she who 'd been got . Talk about calculating ! He was going to run her life , arrange it perfectly by height and color . He was going to sit in the passenger seat with that censoriousexpression on his face and dictate every turn she took , and every shift of gears . Because she knew it would make Ezra happy , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rain had stopped , but there was still a mist . She felt she was walking underwater , in one of those dreams where a person can breathe as easily as on land . There were only a few other people out  --  all of them hurrying , locked in themselves , shrouded by raincoats and plastic scarves . Traffic swished by ; reflections of the headlights wavered on the streets . The restaurant 's kitchen seemed overcrowded ; it was a miracle that an acceptable plate of food could emerge from it . Ezra stood at the stove , supervising the skimming of some broth or soup . A young girl lifted ladles full of steaming liquid and emptied them into a bowl . " When you 're done  --  " Ezra was saying , and then he said , " Why , hello , Jenny , " and came to the door where she waited . Over his jeans he wore a long white apron ; he looked like one of the cooks . He took her around to meet the others ; sweaty men chopping or straining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he would say , but then he 'd get sidetracked by some detail and stand there discussing food . " Can I offer you something to eat ? " he asked finally . " No , I had supper at home . " " Or maybe a drink from the bar ? " " No , thanks . " " This is our headwaiter , Oakes . And this is Josiah Payson ; you remember him . " She looked up and up , into Josiah 's face . He was all in white , spotless ( how had they found a uniform to fit him ? ) , but his hair still bristled wildly . And it was no easier than ever to see where he was directing his gaze . Not at her ; that was certain.  |p105He  was avoiding her . He seemed completely blind to the sight of her . " When the Boyces come , " Ezra was saying to Oakes , " tell them we have the cream of mussel soup . There 's only enough for the two of them ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you , Josiah ? " Jenny asked . " Oh , not bad . " " So you work here now . " " I 'm the salad chef . Mostly , I cut things up . " His spidery hands twisted in front of him . The crease in his forehead seemed deeper than ever . " I 've thought of you often , " Jenny said . She did n't mean it , at first . But then she understood , with a rush to her head that was something like illness , that she spoke the truth : she had been thinking of him all these years without knowing it . It seemed he had never once left her mind . Even Harley , she saw , was just a reverse kind of Josiah , a Josiah turned inside out : equally alien , black-and-white , incomprehensible to anyone but Jenny . " Is your mother well ? " she asked him . " She died . " " Died ! " " A long time ago . She went out shopping and she died . I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , " Jenny said . But still he would n't meet her eyes . Ezra turned from Oakes and asked , " Are you sure I ca n't get you a snack , Jenny ? " " I have to leave , " she told him . Going home , she wondered why the walk seemed so long . Her feet felt unusually heavy , and there was some old , rusty pain deep inside her chest . The ash grove , how graceful , Ezra 's recorder piped out , how sweetly ' t is singing . . . Waking slowly , still webbed in bits of dreams , Jenny found it strange that a pearwood recorder shouldp106put forth plums  --  perfectly round , pure , plummy notes arriving in a spill on her bed . She sat up and thought for a moment . Then she pushed her blankets back and reached for her clothes . Ezra was playing " Le Godiveau de Poisson " when she left the house . Down this street , and then that one , and then another that turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was going to be a beautiful day . The sidewalks were still wet , but the sun was rising in a pearly pink sky above the chimneys . She dug her hands in her coat pockets . She met an old man walking a poodle , but no one else , and even he passed soundlessly and vanished . When she reached the street she wanted , nothing looked familiar and she had to take the alley . She could only find the house from the rear . She recognized that makeshift gray additionbehind the kitchen , and the buckling steps that gave beneath her feet , and the wooden door with most of its paint worn off . She looked for a bell to ring but there was n't one ; she had to knock . There was the scraping of furniture somewhere inside the house  --  chair legs pushing back . Josiah , when he came , was so tall that he darkened the window she peered through . He opened the door . " Jenny ? " he said . " Hello , Josiah . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to see someone else . She noticed his breakfast on the kitchen table : a slice of white bread spread with peanut butter . In the scuffed linoleum and the sink full of dirty dishes , in his tattered jeans and raveling brown sweater , she read neglect and hopelessness . She pulled her coat tighter around her . " What are you , what are you here for ? " he asked . " I did everything wrong , " she told him . " What are you talking about ? " " You must feel I 'm just like the others ! Just like the ones you want to escape from , off in the woods with your sleeping bag . " " Oh , no , Jenny , " he said . " I would never believe you 're like that . "  | " You would n't ? " " Nobody would ; you 're too pretty . " " But I mean  --  " she said . She set a hand on his sleeve . He did n't pull away . Then she stepped closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even through her coat , how thin and bony his rib cage was , and how he warmed his skimpy sweater . She laid her ear against his chest , and he slowly , hesitantly raised his hands to her shoulders . " I should have gone on kissing you , " she said . " I should have told my mother , Go away . Leave us alone . ' I should have stood up for you and not been such a coward . " " No , no , " she heard him say . " I do n't think about it . I do n't think about it . " She drew back and looked up at him . " I do n't talk about it , " he said . " Josiah , " she said , " wo n't you at least tell me it 's all right now ? " " Sure , " he said . " It 's all right , Jenny . " After that , there was really nothing else to discuss . She stood on tiptoe to kiss him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he smiled and let her go . " To everybody 's good health , " Cody said , raising his glass . " To Ezra 's food . To Scarlatti 's Restaurant . " " To a happy family dinner , " Ezra said . " Oh , well , that too , if you like . " They all drank , even Pearl  --  or maybe the little sip she took was only make-believe . She was wearing her netted hat and a beige tailored suit so new that it failed to sit back when she did . Jenny was in an ordinary skirt and blouse , but still she felt dressed up . She felt wonderful , in fact  --  perfectly untroubled . She kept beaming at the others , pleased to have them around her . But really , were they all here ? In Jenny 's new mood , her family seemed too small . These three young people and this shrunken mother , she thought , were not enough to sustain thep108occasion . They could have used several more members  --  a familyclown , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody ; and maybe one of those managerial older sisters who holds a group together by force . As things were , it was Ezra who had to hold them together . He was n't doing a very good job . He was too absorbed in the food . Right now he was conferring with the waiter , gesturing toward the soup , which had arrived a touch too cool , he said  --  though to Jenny it seemed fine . And now Pearl was collecting her purse and sliding back her chair . " Powder room , " she mouthed to Jenny . Ezra would be all the more upset , once he noticed she 'd gone . He liked the family in a group , a cluster , and he hated Pearl 's habit of constantly " freshening up " in a restaurant , just as he hated for Cody to smoke his slim cigars between courses . " I wish just once , " he was always saying , " we could get through a meal from start to finish , " and he would say it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he was telling the waiter , " If Andrew would keep the china hot  --  " " He mostly does , I swear it , but the warming oven 's broke . " " What 's your opinion ? " Cody whispered , setting his face close to Jenny 's . " Has Ezra ever slept with Mrs. Scarlatti ? Or has he not . " Jenny 's mouth dropped open . " Well ? " he asked . " Cody Tull ! " " Do n't tell me it has n't occurred to you . A lonely rich widow , or whatever she is ; nice-looking boy with no prospects ... " " That 's disgusting , " Jenny told him . " Not at all , " Cody said blandly , sitting back . He had a way of surveying people from under half-lowered lids which made him look tolerant and worldly . " There 's nothing wrong , " he said , " with taking advantage of your luck . And you have to admit Ezra 's lucky ; born lucky . Have you ever noticed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over him . They have ever since we were kids . What do they see in him , anyway ? How does he do it ? Is it luck ? You 're a woman ; what 's his secret ? "  | " Honestly , Cody , " Jenny said , " I wish you 'd grow out of this . " Ezra finished his conversation with the waiter . " Where 's Mother ? " he asked . " I turn my back one second and she dis-appears . " " Powder room , " said Cody , lighting a cigar . " Oh , why does she always do that ? More soup is coming , fresh off the stove , piping hot this time . " " Are you having it brought in by barefoot runners ? " Cody asked . Jenny said , " Do n't worry , Ezra . I 'll go call her . " She made her way between the tables , toward a corridor with an EXIT sign over the archway . But just before the ladies ' room , in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Josiah . He had his white uniform on and was carrying an aqua plastic dishpan full of chicory leaves . " Josiah , " she said . He stopped short and his face lit up . " Hi , Jenny , " he said . They stood smiling at each other , not speaking . She reached out to touch his wrist . " Oh , no ! " her mother cried . Jenny snatched her hand back and spun around . " Oh , Jenny . Oh , my God , " Pearl said . Her eyes were no longer gray ; they were black , and she gripped her shiny black purse . " Well , I understand it all now , " she said . " No , wait , " Jenny said . Her heart was beating so fast , it seemed she was vibrating where she stood . " Visiting for no apparent reason , " said Pearl , " and slipping away this morning to meet him like a tramp , some cheap little tramp  --  " " Mother , you 've got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , do n't you see ? " She felt she had run out of breath . Gasping for air , she gestured toward Josiah , who merely stood there with his mouth agape . " He just . . . we just met in the hall and ... it 's not that way at all , he 's nothing to me , do n't you see ? " But she had to say this to Pearl 's back , hurrying after her through the dining room . Pearl reached their table and said , " Ezra , I can not stay here . "  |p110Ezra  stood up . " Mother ? " " I simply can not , " she said . She gathered up her coat and walked away . " But what happened ? " Ezra asked , turning to Jenny . " What 's bothering her ? " Cody said , " That lukewarm soup , no doubt , " and he rocked back comfortably in his chair with a cigar between his teeth . " I wish just once , " Ezra said , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't feel well , " Jenny told him . In fact , her lips were numb . It was a symptom she seemed to remember from before , from some long-forgotten moment , or maybe from a nightmare . She left her coat behind , and she rushed through the dining room and out to the street . At first , she thought her mother had disappeared . Then she found her , half a block ahead  --  a militant figure walking briskly . Oh , what if she would n't even turn around ? Or worse , would turn and lash out , slap , snap , her clawed pearl ring , her knowing face . . . But Jenny ran to catch up with her , anyway . " Mother , " she said . In the light from the liquor store window , she saw her motherreassemble her expression  --  take on a cool , unperturbed look . " You 've got it all wrong , " Jenny told her . " I 'm not a tramp ! I 'm not cheap ! Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pearl said politely . " Of course it matters ! " " You 're over twenty-one . If you do n't know good from bad by now , there 's nothing more I can do about it . " " I felt sorry for him , " Jenny said . They crossed a street and started up the next block . " He told me his mother had died , " Jenny said . They veered around a gang of teen-aged boys . " She was all he had  --  his father 's dead too . She was the center of his life . " " Well , " said Pearl , " I suppose it ca n't have been easy for her . " " I do n't know how he 's going to manage now she 's gone . "  | " I believe I saw her in the grocery once , " said Pearl . " A brown-haired woman ? " " Plumpish , sort of . " " Full in the face ? " " Like a wood thrush , " Jenny said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave a little laugh . " The things you come up with , sometimes ! " They passed the candy store , and then the pharmacy . Jenny and her mother fell into step . They passed the fortune-teller 's window . The same dusty lamp glowed on the table . Jenny , lookingin , thought that Mrs. Parkins had not been much of a prophet . Why , she had even had to listen to the radio for tomorrow'sweather ! And she should have guessed from the very first instant , from the briefest , most cursory glance , that Jenny was not capable of being destroyed by love.  |p112The  first few times that Mrs. Scarlatti stayed in the hospital , Ezra had no trouble getting in to visit her . But the last time was harder . " Relative ? " the nurse would ask . " No , ah , I 'm her business partner . " " Sorry , relatives only . " " But she does n't have any relatives . I 'm all she 's got . See , she and I own this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jar ? " " Her soup . " " Soup , " said the nurse . " I make this soup she likes . " " Mrs. Scarlatti is n't keeping things down . " " I know that , but I wanted to give her something . " This would earn him a slantwise glance , before he was led brusquely into Mrs. Scarlatti 's room . In the past , she had chosen to stay in a ward . ( She was an extremely social woman . ) She 'd sit up straight in her dramatic black robe , a batik scarf hiding her hair , and " Sweetie ! " she 'd say as he entered . For a moment the other women would grow all sly and alert , till they realized how young he was  --  way too young for Mrs. Scarlatti . But now she had a private room , and the most she could do when he arrived was open her eyes andp113then wearily close them . He was n't even sure that he was welcomeany more . He knew that after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his special gizzard soup that she had always loved . There were twenty cloves of garlic in it . Mrs. Scarlatti used to claim it settled her stomach , soothed her nerves  --  changed her whole perception of the day , she said . ( However , it was n't on the restaurant 's menu because it was a bit " hearty "  --  her word  --  and Scarlatti 's Restaurant was very fine and formal . This hurt Ezra 's feelings , a little . ) When she was well enough to be home , he had often brewed single portions in the restaurant kitchen and carried them upstairs to her apartment . Even in the hospital , those first few times , she could manage a small-sized bowl of it . But now she was beyond that . He only brought the soup out of helplessness ; he would have preferred to kneel by her bed and rest his head on her sheets , to take her hands in his and tell her , " Mrs. Scarlatti , come back . " But she was such a no-nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do was offer this soup . He sat in a corner of the room in a green vinyl chair with steel arms . It was October and the steam heat had come on ; the air felt sharp and dry . Mrs. Scarlatti 's bed was cranked upward slightly to help her breathe . From time to time , without opening her eyes , she said , " Oh , God . " Then Ezra would ask , " What ? What is it ? " and she would sigh . ( Or maybe that was the radiator . ) Ezra never brought anything to read , and he never made conversation with the nurses who squeaked in and out on their rubber soles . He only sat , looking down at his pale , oversized hands , which lay loosely on his knees . Previously , he had put on weight . He 'd been nowhere near fat , but he 'd softened and spread in that mild way that fairhairedmen often do . Now the weight fell off . Like Mrs. Scarlatti , he was having trouble keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , floppy frame that seemed oddly two-dimensional . Wide in front and wide behind , he was flat as paper when viewed from the side . His hair fell forward in a sheaf , like wheat . He did n't bother pushing it back.  |p114He  and Mrs. Scarlatti had been through a lot together , he would have said , if asked  --  but what , exactly ? She had had a bad husband ( a matter of luck , she made it seem , like a bad bottle of wine ) and ditched him ; she had lost her only son , Ezra 's age , during the Korean War . But both these events she had suffered alone , before her partnership with Ezra began . And Ezra himself : well , he had not actually been through anything yet . He was twenty-five years old and still without wife or children , still living at home with his mother . What he and Mrs. Scarlatti had survived , it appeared , was year after year of standing still . Her life that had slid off somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd combined , they held each other up in empty space . Ezra was grateful to Mrs. Scarlatti for rescuing him from an aimless , careerless existence and teaching him all she knew ; but more than that , for the fact that she depended on him . If not for her , whom would he have ? His brother and sister were out in the world ; he loved his mother dearly but there was something overemotional about her that kept him eternally wary . By other people 's standards , even he and Mrs. Scarlatti would not have seemed particularly close . He always called her " Mrs. Scarlatti . " She called Ezra her boy , her angel , but was otherwise remarkably distant , and asked no questions at all about his life outside the restaurant . He knew the restaurant would be fully his when she died . She had told him so , just before this last hospital stay . " I do n't want it , " he had said . She was silent . She must have understood that it was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it , in the sense of coveting it ( he never thought much about money ) , but what would he do otherwise ? Anyway , she had no one else to leave it to . She lifted a hand and let it drop . They did n't mention the subject again . Once , Ezra persuaded his mother to come and visit too . He liked for the various people in his life to get along , although he knew that would be difficult in his mother 's case . She spokep115of Mrs. Scarlatti distrustfully , even jealously . " What you see in such a person I ca n't imagine . She 's downright . . . tough , is what she is , in spite of her high-fashion clothes . It looks like her face is not trying . Know what I mean ? Like she ca n't be bothered putting out the effort . Not a bit of lipstick , and those crayony black lines around her eyes . . . and she hardly ever smiles at people . " But now that Mrs. Scarlatti was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She dressed carefully for her visit and wore her netted hat , which made Ezra happy . He associated that hat with important family occasions . He was pleased that she 'd chosen her Sunday black coat , even though it was n't as warm as her everyday maroon . In the hospital , she told Mrs. Scarlatti , " Why , you look the picture of health ! No one would ever guess . " This was not true . But it was nice of her to say it . " After I die , " Mrs. Scarlatti said in her grainy voice , " Ezra must move to my apartment . " His mother said , " Now , let 's have none of that silly talk . " " Which is silly ? " Mrs. Scarlatti asked , but then she was overtakenby exhaustion , and she closed her eyes . Ezra 's mother misunderstood . She must have thought she 'd asked what was silly , a rhetorical question , and she blithely smoothed her skirt around her and said , " Total foolishness , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlatti 's meaning . Which was silly , she was asking  --  her dying , or Ezra 's moving ? But he did n't bother explaining that to his mother . Another time , he got special permission from the nurses ' office to bring a few men from the restaurant  --  Todd Duckett , Josiah Payson , and Raymond the sauce maker . He could tell that Mrs. Scarlatti was glad to see them , although it was an awkward visit . The men stood around the outer edges of the room and cleared their throats repeatedly and would not take seats . " Well ? " said Mrs. Scarlatti . " Are you still buying everythingfresh ? " From the inappropriateness of the question ( none of them was remotely involved with the purchasing ) , Ezrap116realized how out of touch she had grown . But these people , too , were tactful . Todd Duckett gave a mumbled cough and then said , " Yes , ma'am , just how you would 've liked it . " " I 'm tired now , " Mrs. Scarlatti said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an old , old man with a tiny wife who was allowed to sleep on a cot in his room , and a dark-skinned foreigner whose masses of visiting relatives gave the place the look of a gypsy circus . Ezra knew that the comatose woman had cancer , the old man a rare type of blood disease , and the foreigner some cardiac problem  --  it was n't clear what . " Heart rumor , " he was told by a dusky , exotic child who was surely too young to be visiting hospitals . She was standing outside the foreigner 's door , delicately reeling in a yo-yo . " Heart murmur , maybe ? " " No , rumor . " Ezra was starting to feel lonely here and would have liked to make a friend . The nurses were always sending him away while they did something mysterious to Mrs. Scarlatti , and much of any visit he spent leaning dejectedly against the wall outside her room or gazing from the windows of the conservatory at the end of the corridor . But no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  more hushed  --  and all the people he encountered wore a withdrawn , forbidding look . Only the foreign child spoke to him . " I think he 's going to die , " she said . But then she went back to her yo-yo . Ezra hung around a while longer , but it was obvious she did n't find him very interesting . Bibb lettuce , Boston lettuce , chicory , escarole , dripping on the counter in the center of the kitchen . While other restaurants ' vegetables were delivered by anonymous , dank , garbage-smelling trucks , Scarlatti 's had a man named Mr. Purdy , who shopped personally for them each morning before the sun came up . Hep117brought everything to the kitchen in splintery bushel baskets , along about eight a.m. , and Ezra made a point of being there so that he would know what foods he had to deal with that day . Sometimes there were no eggplants , sometimes twice as many as planned . In periods like this  --  dead November , now  --  nothing grew locally , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrots and waxy cucumbers shipped in from out of state . And the tomatoes ! They were a crime . " Just look , " said Mr. Purdy , picking one up . " Vine-grown , the fellow tells me . Vine-grown , yes . I 'd like to see them grown on anything else . But ripened ? ' I say . However was they ripened ? ' Vineripened , too , ' fellow assures me . Well , maybe so . But nowadays , I do n't know , all them taste anyhow like they spent six weeks on a windowsill . Like they was made of windowsill , or celluloid , or pencil erasers . Well , I tell you , Ezra : I apologize . It breaks my heart to bring you such rubbage as this here ; I 'd sooner not show up at all . " Mr. Purdy was a pinched and prunish man in overalls , a white shirt , and a shiny black suit coat . He had a narrow face that seemed eternally disapproving , even during the growing season . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous about him . Mr. Purdy rejoiced in food as much as Ezra did , and for the same reasons  --  less for eating himself than for serving to others . He had once invited Ezra to his home , a silver-colored trailer out on Ritchie Highway , and given him a meal consisting solely of new asparagus , which both he and Ezra agreed had the haunting taste of oysters . Mrs. Purdy , a smiling , round-faced woman in a wheelchair , had claimed they talked like lunatics , but she finished two large helpings while both men tenderly watched . It was a satisfaction to see how she polished her buttery plate . " If this restaurant was just mine , " Ezra said now , " I would n't serve tomatoes in the winter . People would ask for tomatoes and I 'd say , What can you be thinking of , this is not the season . ' I 'd give them something better . " " They 'd stomp out directly , " Mr. Purdy said . " No , they might surprise you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it every day just two or three good dishes . Of course ! In France , they do that all the time . Or I 'd offer no choice at all ; examine people and say , You look a little tired . I 'll bring you an oxtail stew . ' " " Mrs. Scarlatti would just die , " said Mr. Purdy . There was a silence . He rubbed his bristly chin , and then corrected himself : " She 'd rotate in her grave . " They stood around a while . " I do n't really want a restaurant anyhow , " Ezra said . " Sure , " Mr. Purdy said . " I know that . " Then he put his black felt hat on , and thought a moment , and left . The foreign child slept in the conservatory , her head resting on the stainless steel arm of a chair like the one in Mrs. Scarlatti 's room . It made Ezra wince . He wanted to fold his coat and slide it beneath her cheek , but he worried that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood at one of the windows gazing down on pedestrians far below . How small and determinedtheir feet looked , emerging from their foreshortened figures ! The perseverance of human beings suddenly amazed him . A woman entered the room  --  one of the foreigners . She was lighter skinned than the others , but he knew she was foreign because of her slippers , which contrasted with her expensive wool dress . The whole family , he had noticed , changed into slippers as soon as they arrived each morning . They made themselvesat home in every possible way  --  setting out bags of seeds and nuts and spicy-smelling foods , once even brewing a quart of yogurt on the conservatory radiator . The men smoked cigarettes in the hall , and the women murmured together while knitting brightly colored sweaters . Now the woman approached the child , bent over her , and tucked her hair back . Then she lifted her in her arms and settled in the chair . The child did n't wake . She only nestled closer andp119sighed . So after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had missed an opportunity . It was like missing a train  --  or something more important , something that would never come again . There was no explanation for the grief that suddenlyfilled him . He decided to start serving his gizzard soup in the restaurant . He had the waiters announce it to patrons when they handed over the menu . " In addition to the soups you see here , we are pleased to offer tonight . . . " One of the waiters had failed to show up and Ezra hired a woman to replace him  --  strictly against Mrs. Scarlatti 's policy . ( Waitresses , she said , belonged in truck stops . ) The woman did much better than the men with Ezra 's soup . " Try our gizzard soup , " she would say . " It 's really hot and garlicky and it 's made with love . " Outside it was bitter cold , and the woman was so warm and helpful , more and more people followed her suggestion . Ezra thought that the next time a waiter left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another after that , and so on . He experimented the following week with a spiced crab casserole of his own invention , and then with a spinach bisque , and when the waiters complained about all they had to memorize he finally went ahead and bought a blackboard . SPECIALS , he wrote at the top . But in the hospital , when Mrs. Scarlatti asked how things were going , he did n't mention any of this . Instead , he sat forward and clasped his hands tight and said , " Fine . Urn . . . fine . " If she noticed anything strange in his voice , she did n't comment on it . Mrs. Scarlatti had always been a lean , dark , slouching woman , with a faintly scornful manner . It was true , as Ezra 's mother said , that she gave the impression of not caring what people thought of her . But that had been part of her charm  --  her sleepy eyes , hardly troubling to stay open , and her indifferent tone ofp120voice . Now , she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stone , and her face began to seem sphinxlike , all flat planes and straight lines . Even her hair was sphinxlike  --  a short , black wedge , a clump of hair , dulled and rough . Sometimes Ezra believed that she was not dying but petrifying . He had trouble remembering her low laugh , her casual arrogance . ( " Sweetie , " she used to say , ordering him off to some task , trilling languid fingers . " Angel boy . . . " ) He had never felt more than twelve years old around her , but now he was ancient , her parent or grandparent . He soothed and humored her . Not all she said was quite clear these days . " At least , " she whispered once , " I never made myself ridiculous , Ezra , did I ? " " Ridiculous ? " he asked . " With you . " " With me ? Of course not . " He was puzzled , and must have shown it ; she smiled and rocked her head on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she told him . It must have been a momentary wandering of the brain . ( She had n't known him as a child . ) " You take it all for granted , " she said . Maybe she was confusing him with Billy , her son . She turned her face away from him and closed her eyes . He felt suddenly anxious . He was reminded of that time his mother had nearly died , wounded by a misfired arrow  --  entirely Ezra 's fault ; Ezra , the family stumbler . " I 'm so sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , " he had cried , but the apology had never been accepted because his brother had been blamed instead , and his father , who had purchased the archery set . Ezra , his mother 's favorite , had got off scot-free . He 'd been left unforgiven  --  notrelieved , as you might expect , but forever burdened . " You 're mistaken , " he said now , and Mrs. Scarlatti 's eyelids fluttered into crepe but failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . See who I am , I 'm Ezra , " he said , and then ( for no logical reason ) he bent close and said , " Mrs. Scarlatti . Rememberwhen I left the army ? Discharged for sleepwalking ? Sent home ? Mrs. Scarlatti , I was n't really all the way asleep . I mean , I knew what I was doing . I did n't plan to sleepwalk , but partp121of me was conscious , and observed what was going on , and could have wakened the rest of me if I 'd tried . I had this feeling like watching a dream , where you know you can break it off at any moment . But I did n't ; I wanted to go home . I just wanted to leave that army , Mrs. Scarlatti . So I did n't stop myself . " If she had heard ( with her only son , Billy , blown to bits in Korea ) , she would have risen up , sick as she was , and shouted , " Out ! Out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for she only rocked her head again and smiled and went on sleeping . Just after Thanksgiving the woman who 'd been in a coma died , and the tiny old man either died or went home , but the foreigner stayed on and his relatives continued to visit . Now that they knew Ezra by sight , they hailed him as he passed . " Come ! " they would call , and he would step in , shy and pleased , and stand around for several minutes with his fists locked in his armpits . The sick man was yellow and sunken , hooked to a number of tubes , but he always tried to smile at Ezra 's entrance . Ezra had the impression that he knew no English . The others spoke English according to their ages  --  the child perfectly , the young adults with a strong , attractive accent , the old ones in ragged segments . Eventually , though , even the most fluent forgotthemselves and drifted into their native language  --  a musical one , with rounded vowels that gave their lips a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were perpetually tut-tutting . Ezra loved to listen . When you could n't understand what people said , he thought , how clearly the links and joints in their relationships stood out ! A woman 's face lit and bloomed as she turned to a certain man ; a barbed sound of pain leapt from the patient and his wife doubled over . The child , when upset , stroked her mother 's gold wristwatch band for solace . Once a young girl in braids sang a song with almost no tune . It wandered from note to note as if by accident . Then a man with a heavy black mustache recited what must have been a poem . He spoke so grandly and unselfconsciously that passersbyp122glanced in , and when he had finished he translated it for Ezra. " 0 dead one , why did you die in the springtime ? You have n't yet tasted the squash , or the cucumber salad . " Why , even their poetry touched matters close to Ezra 's heart . By December he had replaced three of the somber-suited waiters with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick beige menus and started listing each day 's dishes on the blackboard . This meant , of course , that the cooks all left ( none of the dishes were theirs , or even their type ) , so he did most of the cooking himself , with the help of a woman from New Orleans and a Mexican . These two had recipes of their own as well , some of which Ezra had never tasted before ; he was entranced . It was true that the customers seemed surprised , but they adjusted , Ezra thought . Or most of them did . Now he grew feverish with new ideas , and woke in the night longing to share them with someone . Why not a restaurant full of refrigerators , where people came and chose the food they wanted ? They could fix it themselves on a long , long stove lining one wall of the dining room . Or maybe he could install a giant fireplace , with a whole steer turning slowly on a spit . You 'd slice what you liked onto your plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests at large . Then again , maybe he would start serving only street food . Of course ! He 'd cook what people felt homesick for  --  tacos like those from vendor 's carts in California , which the Mexican was always piningafter ; and that wonderful vinegary North Carolina barbecue that Todd Duckett had to have brought by his mother several times a year in cardboard cups . He would call it the Homesick Restaurant . He 'd take down the old black and gilt sign . . . But then he saw the sign , SCARLATTI 'S , and he groaned and pressed his fingers to his eyes and turned over in his bed . " You have a beautiful country , " the light-skinned woman said . " Thank you , " said Ezra.  | " All that green ! And so many birds . Last summer , before my father-in-law fell ill , we were renting a house in New Jersey . The Garden State , they call it . There were roses everywhere . We could sit on the lawn after supper and listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra . " The nightingales . " " Nightingales ? In New Jersey ? " " Of course , " she said . " Also we liked the shopping . In particular , Korvette 's . My husband likes the . . . how do you say ? Drip and dry suits . " The sick man moaned and tossed , nearly dislodging a tube that entered the back of his wrist . His wife , an ancient , papery lady , leaned toward him and stroked his hand . She murmured something , and then she turned to the younger woman . Ezra saw that she was crying . She did n't attempt to hide it but wept openly , tears streaming down her cheeks . " Ah , " the younger woman said , and she left Ezra 's side and bent over the wife . She gathered her up in her arms as she 'd gathered the child earlier . Ezra knew he should leave , but he did n't . Instead he turned and gazed out the window , slightly tilting his head and looking nonchalant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are standing on the porch , waiting to be noticed and invited in . Ezra 's sister , Jenny , sat at the desk in her old bedroom , reading a battered textbook . She was strikingly pretty , even in reading glasses and the no-color quilted bathrobe she always left on a closet hook for her visits home . Ezra stopped at her doorway and peered in . " Jenny ? " he asked . " What are you doing here ? " " I thought I 'd take a breather , " she said . She removed her glasses and gave him a blurry , unfocused look . " It is n't semester break yet , is it ? " " Semester break ! Do you think medical students have time for such things ? " " No , well , " he said.  |p124But  lately she 'd been home more often than not , it appeared to him . And she never mentioned Harley , her husband . She had n't referred to him once all fall , and maybe even all summer . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had said recently . " Oh , do n't act so surprised ! It must have crossed your mind . Here she suddenly moves to a new address  --  closer to the school , she claims  --  and then ca n't have us to visit , anytime I offer ; always too busy or preparing for some quiz , and when I call , you notice , it 's never Harley who answers , never once Harley who picks up the phone . Does n't that strike you as odd ? But I 'm unable to broach the subject . I mean , she deflects me , if you know what I mean . Somehow I just never . . . you could , though . She always did feel closer to you than to me or Cody . Wo n't you just ask her what 's what ? " But now when he lounged in the doorway , trying to find some way to sidle into a conversation , Jenny put her glasses back on and returned to her book . He felt dismissed . " Urn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Fine , " she said , eyes scanning the print . " Harley all right ? " There was a deep , studious silence . " It does n't seem we ever get to see him any more , " Ezra said . " He 's okay , " Jenny said . She turned a page . Ezra waited a while longer , and then he straightened up from the doorway and went downstairs . He found his mother in the kitchen , unpacking groceries . " Well ? " she asked him . " Well , what ? " " Did you talk to Jenny ? " " Ah .. She still had her coat on ; she thrust her hands in her pockets and faced him squarely , with her bun slipping down the back of her head . " You promised me , " she told him . " You swore you 'd talk to her . " " I did n't swear to , Mother . " " You took a solemn oath , " she told him . " I notice she still wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , " said his mother . She went back to her groceries . " She would n't wear a ring if she and Harley were separated , would she ? " " She would if she wanted to fool us . " " Well , I do n't know , if she wants to fool us maybe we ought to act fooled . I do n't know . " " All my life , " his mother said , " people have been trying to shut me out . Even my children . Especially my children . If I so much as ask that girl how she 's been , she shies away like I 'd inquired into the deepest , darkest part of her . Now , why should she be so standoffish ? " Ezra said , " Maybe she cares more about what you think than what outsiders think . " " Ha , " said his mother . She lifted a carton of eggs from the grocery bag . " I 'm worried I do n't know how to get in touch with people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried if I come too close , they 'll say I 'm overstepping . They 'll say I 'm pushy , or . . . emotional , you know . But if I back off , they might think I do n't care . I really , honestly believe I missed some rule that everyone else takes for granted ; I must have been absent from school that day . There 's this narrow little dividing line I somehow never located . " " Nonsense ; I do n't know what you 're talking about , " said his mother , and then she held up an egg . " Will you look at this ? Out of one dozen eggs , four are cracked . Two are smushed . I ca n't imagine what Sweeney Brothers is coming to , these days . " Ezra waited a while , but she did n't say any more . Finally , he left . He tore down the wall between the restaurant kitchen and the dining room , doing most of the work in a single night . He slung a sledgehammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plaster till a thick white dust had settled over everything . Then he came upon a mass of pipes and electrical wiresp126and he had to call in professionals to finish off the job . The damage was so extensive that he was forced to stay closed for four straight weekdays , losing a good deal of money . He figured that while he was at it , he might as well redecorate the dining room . He raced around the windows and dragged down the stiff brocade draperies ; he peeled up the carpeting and persuaded a brigade of workmen to sand and polish the floorboards . By the evening of the fourth day , he was so tired that he could feel the hinging of every muscle . Even so , he washed the white from his hair and changed out of his speckled jeans and went to pay a visit to Mrs. Scarlatti . She lay in her usual position , slightly propped , but her expression was alert and she even managed a smile when he entered . " Guess what , angel , " she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave ? " " I asked the doctor , and he 's letting me go home . " " Home ? " " As long as I hire a nurse , he says . . . Well , do n't just stand there , Ezra . I need for you to see about a nurse . If you 'll look in that nightstand ... " It was more talking than she 'd done in weeks . Ezra felt almost buoyant with new hope ; underneath , it seemed , he must have given up on her . But of course , he was also worried about the restaurant . What would she think when she saw it ? What would she say to him ? " Everything must go back again , just the way it was , " he could imagine . " Really , Ezra . Put up that wall this instant , and fetch my carpets and my curtains . " He suspected that he had very poor taste , much inferior to Mrs. Scarlatti 's . She would say , " Dear heart , how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hers . He wondered if he could keep her from finding out , if he could convince her to stay in her apartment till he had returned things to normal . He thanked his stars that he had n't changed the sign that hung outside.  |p127It  was Ezra who settled the bill at the business office , the following morning . Then he spoke briefly with her doctor , whom he chanced to meet in the corridor . " This is wonderful about Mrs. Scarlatti , " Ezra said . " I really did n't expect it . " " Oh , " said the doctor . " Well . " " I was getting sort of discouraged , if you want to know the truth . " " Well , " the doctor said again , and he held out his hand so suddenly that it took Ezra a second to respond . After that , the doctor walked off . Ezra felt there was a lot more the man could have said , as a matter of fact . Mrs. Scarlatti went home by ambulance . Ezra drove behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She lay on a stretcher , and next to her was another stretcher holding a man in two full leg casts . His wife perched beside him , evidently talking nonstop . Ezra could see the feathers on her hat bob up and down with her words . Mrs. Scarlatti was let off first . The ambulance men unloaded her while Ezra stood around feeling useless . " Oh , smell that air , " said Mrs. Scarlatti . " Is n't it fresh and beautiful . " Actually , it was terrible air  --  wintry and rainy and harsh with soot . " I never told you this , Ezra , " she said , as they wheeled her through the building 's front entrance , " but I really did n't believe I would see this place again . My little apartment , my restaurant . .. " Then she raised a palm  --  her old , peremptory gesture , directed toward the ambulance men . They were preparing to guide her stretcher through the right-hand door and up the stairs . " Dear fellow , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that door on the left and let me take a peek ? " It happened so fast , Ezra did n't have time to protest . The man reached back in a preoccupied way and opened the door to the restaurant . Then he resumed his study of the stairs ; there was an angle at the top that was going to pose a problem . Mrs. Scarlatti , meanwhile , turned her face with some effort and gazed through the door . There was a moment , just a flicker of a second , when Ezra dared to hope that she might approve after all . But looking pastp128her , he realized that was impossible . The restaurant was a warehouse , a barn , a gymnasium  --  a total catastrophe . Tables and upended chairs huddled in one corner , underneath bald , barren windows . Buckling plank footbridges led across the varnished floor , which had somehow picked up a film of white dust , and the missing kitchen wall was as horrifying as a toothless smile . Only two broad , plaster pillars separated the kitchen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbage cans , the blackened stove , the hanging pots with their tarnished bottoms , a calendar showing a girl in a sheer black nightgown , and a windowsill bearing two dead plants and a Brillo pad and Todd Duckett 's asthma inhalant . " Oh , my God , " said Mrs. Scarlatti . She looked up into his eyes . Her face seemed stripped . " You might at least have waited 611 1 died , " she said . " Oh ! " said Ezra . " No , you do n't understand ; you do n't know . It was n't what you think . It was just . . . I ca n't explain , I went wild somehow ! " But she raised that palm of hers and sailed up the stairs to her apartment . Even lying flat , she had an air of speed and power . She did n't refuse to see him again  --  nothing like that . Every morning he paid her a visit , and was admitted by her day nurse . He sat on the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health inspections and linen deliveries . Mrs. Scarlatti was unfailingly polite , nodding in all the right places , but she never said much in return . Eventually , she would close her eyes as a sign that the visit was finished . Then Ezra would leave , often jostling her bed by accident or overturning his chair . He had always been a clumsy man , but now was more so than usual . It seemed to him his hands were too big , forever getting in the way . If only he could have done something with them ! He would have liked to fix her a meal  --  a sustaining meal , with a depth of flavors , a complicated meal that would require a whole day of chopping things small , and grinding , and blending . In the kitchen , as nowhere else , Ezra came into his own ,  |p129like  someone crippled on dry land but effortlessly graceful once he takes to water . However , Mrs. Scarlatti still was n't eating . There was nothing he could offer her . Or he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen ! Listen ! " But something closed-off about her face kept stopping him . Almost in plain words , she was telling him that she preferred he not do such a thing . So he did n't . After a visit , he would go downstairs and look in on the restaurant , which at this hour was vacant and echoing . He might check the freezer , or erase the blackboard , and then perhaps just wander a while , touching this and that . The wallpaper in the back hall was too cluttered and he ripped it off the wall . He tore away the ornate gilt sconces beside the telephone . He yanked the old-fashioned silhouettes from the restroom doors . Sometimes he did so much damage that there was barely time to cover it up before opening , but everybody pitched in and it always got done somehow or other . By six o'clock , when the first customers arrived , the food was cooked and the tables were laid and the waitresses were calm and smiling . Everything was smoothed over . Mrs. Scarlatti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the nurse phoned Ezra , he felt a crushing sense of shock . You would think this death was unexpected . He said , " Oh , no , " and hung up , and had to call back to ask the proper questions . Had the end been peaceful ? Had Mrs. Scarlatti been awake ? Had she said any words in particular ? Nothing , said the nurse . Really , nothing at all ; just slipped away , like . " But she mentionedyou this morning , " she added . " I almost wondered , you know ? It was almost like she sensed it . She said , Tell Ezra to change the sign . ' " " Sign ? " " It 's not Scarlatti 's Restaurant any more , ' she said . Or something like that . It is n't Scarlatti 's . ' I think that 's what she said . " From the pain he felt , Mrs. Scarlatti might as well havereached out from death and slapped him across the face . It madep130things easier , in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was gone . He noticed how the trees outside sparkled like something newly minted . He was the one who made the arrangements , working from a list that Mrs. Scarlatti had given him months before . He knew which funeral home to call and which pastor , and which acquaintancesshe had wanted at the service . A peculiar thing : he thought of phoning the hospital and inviting that foreign family . Of course he did n't , but it was true they would have made wonderful mourners . Certainly they 'd have done better than those who did come , and who later stood stiffly around her frozen grave . Ezra , too , was stiff  --  a sad , tired man in a flapping coat , holding his mother 's arm . Something ached behind his eyes . If he had cried , Mrs. Scarlatti would have said , " Jesus , Ezra . For God 's sake , sweetie . " Afterward , he was glad to go to the restaurant . It helped to keep busy  --  stirring and seasoning and tasting , stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once stood . Later , he circulated among the diners as Mrs. Scarlatti herself used to do . He urged upon them his oyster stew , his artichoke salad , his spinach bisque and his chili-bean soup and his gizzard soup that was made with love.  |p131Cody  Tull always had a girlfriend , one girl after another , and all the girls were wild about him till they met his brother , Ezra . Something about Ezra just hooked their attention , it seemed . In his presence they took on a bright , sharp , arrested look , as if listening to a sound that others had n't caught yet . Ezra did n't even notice this . Cody did , of course . He would give an exaggeratedsigh , pretending to be amused . Then the girl would collect herself . It was already too late , though ; Cody never allowed second chances . He had a talent for mentally withdrawing . An Indian-faced man with smooth black hair , with level , balanced features , he could manage , when he tried , to seem perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ragged , dirty , unloved younger self , with failing grades , with a U in deportment , clenched his fists and howled , " Why ? Why always Ezra ? Why that sissy pale goody-goody Ezra ? " But Ezra just gazed into space from behind his clear gray eyes , from under his shock of soft , fair hair , and went on thinkinghis private thoughts . You could say this for Ezra : he seemed honestly unaware of the effect he had on women . No one could accuse him of stealing them deliberately . But that made it all the worse , in a way . Cody half believed that Ezra had some lack  --  a lack that worked in his favor , that made him immune , that set him apartp132from ordinary men . There was something almost monkish about him . Women never really managed to penetrate his meditations , although he was unfailingly courteous to them , and considerate . He was likely to contemplate them in silence for an inappropriatelength of time , and then ask something completely out of the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little gold circles through your ears ? " It was ridiculous  --  a man reaches the age of twenty-seven without having heard of pierced earrings . However , it must not have seemed ridiculous to the woman he was addressing . She raised a finger to an earlobe in a startled , mesmerizedway . She was spellbound . Was it Ezra 's unexpectedness ? The narrowness of his focus ? ( He 'd passed up her low-cut dress , powdered cleavage , long silky legs . ) Or his innocence , perhaps . He was a tourist on a female planet , was what he was saying . But he did n't realize he was saying it , and failed to understand the look she gave him . Or did n't care , if he did understand . Only one of Cody 's girlfriends had not been attracted to his brother . This was a social worker named Carol , or maybe Karen . Upon meeting Ezra , she had fixed him with a cool stare . Later , she had remarked to Cody that she disliked motherly men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd met him at his restaurant ) , " but acting so clumsy and shy , in the end it 's you that takes care of them . Ever notice that ? " However , she hardly counted ; Cody had so soon afterward lost interest in her . You might wonder why he went on making these introductions , considering his unfortunate experiences  --  the earliest datingfrom the year he turned fourteen , the latest as recent as a month ago . After all , he lived in New York City and his family lived in Baltimore ; he did n't really have to bring these women home on weekends . In fact , he often swore that he would stop it . He would meet somebody , marry her , and not mention her even to his mother . But that would mean a lifetime of suspense . He 'd keep watching his wife uncomfortably , suspiciously . He 'd keep waiting for the inevitable  --  like Sleeping Beauty 's parents , waiting for the needle that was bound to prick her finger in spite of their precautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his business ,  |p133certainly  ready to marry . He considered his New York apartmenttemporary , a matter of minor convenience ; he had recently purchased a farmhouse in Baltimore County with forty acres of land . Weekends , he traded his slim gray suit for corduroys and he roamed his property , making plans . There was a sunny backyardwhere his wife could have her kitchen garden . There were bedrooms waiting to be stocked with children . He imagined them tumbling out to meet him every Friday afternoon when he came home . He felt rich and lordly . Poor Ezra : all he had was that disorganized restaurant , in the cramped , stunted center of the city . Once , Cody invited Ezra to hunt rabbits with him in the woods behind the farm . It was n't a success . First Ezra fell into a yellowjackets ' nest . Then he got his rifle wet in the stream . And when they paused on a hilltop for lunch , he whipped out his battered recorder and commenced to tootling " Greensleeves , " scaring off all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been his intention . Cody was n't even talking to him , at the end ; Ezra had to chatter on by himself . Cody stalked well ahead of him in total silence , trying to remember why this outing had seemed such a good idea . Ezra sang " Mister Rabbit . " " Every little soul , " he sang , blissfully off-key , " must shine , shine ... " No wonder Cody was a cuticle chewer , a floor pacer , a hair rummager . No wonder , when he slept at night , he ground his teeth so hard that his jaws ached every morning . Early in the spring of 196o , his sister , Jenny , wrote him a letter . Her divorce was coming through in June , she said  --  two more months , and then she 'd be free to marry Sam Wiley . Cody did n't think much of Wiley , and he flicked this news aside like a gnat and read on . Though it looks , she said , as if Ezra might beat me down the aisle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than that . Then she said she was seriously considering dropping out of medical school . The complications of her personallife , she said , were using up so much energy that she hadp134none left over for anything else . Also , she had gained three pounds in the last six weeks and was perfectly obese , a whale , living now on lettuce leaves and lemon water . Cody was accustomed to Jenny 's crazy diets ( she was painfully thin ) , so he skimmed that part . He finished the letter and folded it . Ruth ? He opened it again. ... as if Ezra might beat me down the aisle , he read . He triedto think of some other kind of aisle  --  airplane , supermarket , movie house  --  but in the end , he had to believe it : Ezra was getting married . Well , at least now Cody could keep his own girls . ( This gave him , for some reason , a little twinge of uneasiness . ) But Ezra ! Married ? That walking accident ? Imagine him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses , losing track of the service while smiling out the window at a hummingbird . Imagine him in bed with a woman . ( Cody snorted . ) He pictured the woman as dark and Biblical , because of her name : Ruth . Shadowed eyes and creamy skin . Torrents of loose black hair . Cody had a weakness for black-haired women ; he did n't like blondes at all . He pictured her bare shouldered , in a red satin nightgown , and he crumpled Jenny 's letter roughly and dropped it in the wastebasket . The next day at work , Ruth 's image hung over him . He was doing a time-and-motion study of a power-drill factory in New Jersey , a dinosaur of a place . It would take him weeks to sortit out . Joining object K to object L : right-hand transport unloaded , search , grasp , transport loaded . . . He passed down theassembly line with his clipboard , attracting hostile glances . Ruth 's black hair billowed in the rafters . Unavoidable delays : 3 . Avoidable delays : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly tilted . No doubt her hands were heavily ringed , with long , oval fingernails painted scarlet . When he returned to his apartment that evening , there was a letter from Ezra . It was an invitation to his restaurant this coming Saturday night . You are cordially invited was centered on the page like something engraved  --  Ezra 's idea of a joke . ( Or maybe not ; maybe he meant it in earnest . ) Oh , Lord , notp135another one of Ezra 's dinners . There would be toasts and a fumbling , sentimental speech leading up to some weighty announcement  --  inthis case , his engagement . Cody thought of declining , but what good would that do ? Ezra would be desolate if a single person was missing . He 'd cancel the whole affair and reschedule it for later , and keep on rescheduling till Cody accepted . Cody might as well go and be done with it . Besides , he would n't at all mind meeting this Ruth . Ezra was listening to a customer  --  or a one-time customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " the man was saying , " this place had class . You follow me ? " Ezra nodded , watching him with such a sympathetic , kindly expression that Cody wondered if his mind were n't somewhere else altogether . " Used to be there was fine French cuisine , flamed at the tables and all , " said the man . " And chandeliers . And a hat-check girl . And waiters in black tie . What happened to your waiters ? " " They put people off , " Ezra said . " They seemed to think the customers were taking an exam of some kind , not just ordering a meal . They were uppish . " " I liked your waiters . " " Nowadays our staff is homier , " Ezra said , and he gestured toward a passing waitress  --  a tall , stooped , colorless girl , open mouthed with concentration , fiercely intent upon the coffee mug that she carried in both hands . She inched across the floor , breathing adenoidally . She proceeded directly between Ezra and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The customer said , " Nettie , ' I said , you 've just got to see Scarlatti 's . Do n't knock Baltimore , ' I tell her , till you see Scarlatti 's . ' Then we come upon it and even the sign 's gone . HomesickRestaurant , you call it now . What kind of a name is that ? And the decor ! Why , it looks like . . . why , a gigantic roadside diner ! " He was right . Cody agreed with him . Dining room walls lined with home preserves , kitchen laid open to the public ,  |p136unkem|pt  cooks milling around compiling their favorite dishes ( health food , street food , foreign food , whatever popped into their heads ) . . . Ever since Ezra had inherited this place  --  from a woman , would n't you know  --  he 'd been systematically wreckingit . He was fully capable of serving a single entree all one evening , bringing it to your table himself as soon as you were seated . Other nights he 'd offer more choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But still you might not get what you asked for . " The Smithfield ham , " you 'd say , and up would come the okra stew . " With that cough of yours , I know this will suit you better , " Ezra would explain . But even if he 'd judged correctly , was that any way to run a restaurant ? You order ham , ham is what you get . Otherwise , you might as well eat at home . " You 'll go bankrupt in a year , " Cody had promised , and Ezra almost did go bankrupt ; most of the regular patrons disappeared . Some hung on , though ; and others discovered it . There were several older people who ate here every night , sitting alone at their regular tables in the barnlike , plank-floored dining room . They could afford it because the prices were n't written but recited instead by the staff , evidently according to whim , altering with the customer . ( Was n't that illegal ? ) Ezra worried about what these older people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , worried about Ezra 's accountbooks , but did n't offer to go over them . He would find a disaster , he was sure  --  errors and bad debts , if not outright , naive crookery . Better not to know ; better not to get involved . " It 's true there 've been some changes , " Ezra was telling his ex-customer , " but if you 'll just try our food , you 'll see that we 're still a fine restaurant . Tonight it 's all one dish  --  pot roast . " " Pot roast ! " " A really special kind  --  consoling . " " Pot roast I can get at home , " said the man . He clamped a felt hat on his head and walked out . " Oh , well , " Ezra told Cody . " You ca n't please everybody , I guess . " They made their way to the far corner , where a RESERVEDp137on the afternoon train , had asked her mother 's help in shopping for a dress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . " Everything 's planned for six-thirty , " he said . " What 's keeping them ? " " Well , no problem if it 's only pot roast . " " It 's not only pot roast , " Ezra said . He sat in a chair . His suit had a way of waffling around him , as if purchased for a much larger man . " This is something more . I mean , pot roast is really not the right name ; it 's more like . . . what you long for when you 're sad and everyone 's been wearing you down . See , there 's this cook , this real country cook , and pot roast is the least of what she does . There 's also pan-fried potatoes , black-eyed peas , beaten biscuits genuinely beat on a stump with the back of an ax  --  " " Here they come , " Cody said . Jenny and her mother were just walking across the dining room . They carried no parcels , but something made it clear they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared . Jenny 's lipstick was chewed off . Pearl 's hat was knocked crooked and her hair was frizzier than ever . " What took you so long ? " Ezra asked , jumping up . " We were starting to worry . " " Oh , this Jenny and her notions , " said Pearl . " Her size eight figure and no bright colors , no pastels , no gathers or puckers or trim , nothing to make her look fat , so-called . . . Why are there five places set ? " The question took them all off guard . It was true , Cody saw . There were five plates and five crystal wineglasses . " How come ? " Pearl asked Ezra . " Oh . . . I 'll get to that in a minute . Have a seat , Mother , over there . " But she kept standing . " Then at last we find just the right thing , " she said . " A nice soft gray with a crocheted collar , Jenny all the way . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does . She has a tantrum in the middle of Hutzler 's department store . " sign sat upon the table that Ezra always chose for family dinners . Jenny and their mother were n't there yet . Jenny , who 'd arrived " Not a tantrum , Mother , " Jenny told her . " I merely said  --  " " Said , It is n't a funeral , Mother ; I 'm not going into mourning . ' You 'd think I 'd chosen widow 's weeds . This was a nice pale gray , very ladylike , very suitable for a second marriage . " " Anthracite , " Jenny told Cody . " Pardon ? " " Anthracite was what the saleslady called it . In other words : coal . Our mother thinks it suitable to marry me off in a coalblackwedding dress . " " Uh , " said Ezra , looking around at the other diners , " maybe we should be seated now . " But Pearl just stood straighter . " And then , " she told her sons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only to spite me , she goes rushing over to the nearest rack and pulls out something white as snow . " " It was cream colored , " Jenny said . " Cream , white  --  what 's the difference ? Both are inappropriate , if you 're marrying for the second time and the divorce has n't yet been granted and the man has no steady employment . I ' 11 take this one , ' she says , and it 's not even the proper size , miles too big , had to be left at the store for alterations . " " I happened to like it , " Jenny said . " You were lost in it . " " It made me look thin . " " Maybe you could wear a shawl or something , brown , " said her mother . " That might tone it down some . " " I ca n't wear a shawl in a wedding . " " Why not ? Or a little jacket , say a brown linen jacket . " " I look fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chanel-type . " " I hate Chanel . " " Well , " said Pearl , " I can see that nothing will satisfy you . " " Mother , " Jenny said , " I 'm already satisfied . I 'm satisfied with my cream-colored dress , just the way it is . I love it . Will you please just get off my back ? " " Did you hear that ? " Pearl asked her sons . " Well , I don'tp139have to stand here and take it . " And she turned and marched back across the dining room , erect as a little wind-up doll . Ezra said , " Huh ? " Jenny opened a plastic compact , looked into it , and then snapped it shut , as if merely making certain that she was still there . " Please , Jenny , wo n't you go after her ? " Ezra asked . " Not on your life . " " You 're the one she fought with . I ca n't persuade her . " " Oh , Ezra , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think I 'm up to all this . " " What are you saying ? Not have dinner at all ? " " I could only eat lettuce leaves anyhow , " Jenny told him . " But this is important ! It was going to be an occasion . Oh , just . . . wait . Wait here a minute , will you ? " Ezra turned and rushed off to the kitchen . From the swarm of assorted cooks at the counter , he plucked a small person in overalls . It was a girl , Cody guessed  --  a weasel-faced little redhead . She followed Ezra jauntily , almost stiff-legged , wiping her palms on her backside . " I 'd like you to meet Ruth , " Ezra said . Cody said , " Ruth ? " " We 're getting married in September . " " Oh , " said Cody . Then Jenny said , " Well , congratulations , " and kissed Ruth 's bony , freckled cheek , and Cody said , " Uh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebbles on her palm . " How do , " she told him . He thought of the phrase banty hen , although he had never seen a banty hen . Or maybe she was more of a rooster . Her brisk , carroty hair was cut so short that it seemed too scant for her skull . Her blue eyes were round as marbles , and her skin was so thin and tight ( as if , like her hair , it had been skimped on ) that he could see the white cartilage across the bridge of her nose . " So , " he said . " Ruth . " " Are you surprised ? " Ezra asked him . " Yes , very surprised . "  | " I wanted to do it right ; I was going to announce it over drinks and then call her in to join the family dinner . But , honey , " Ezra said , turning to Ruth , " I guess Mother was overtired . It did n't work out the way I 'd planned . " " Shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody said , " Surely . Certainly . ' We can always do it later . " Then Jenny started asking about the wedding , and Cody excused himself and said he thought he 'd go see how their mother was . Outside in the dark , walking up the street toward home , he had the strangest feeling of loss . It was as if someone had died , or had left him forever  --  the beautiful , black-haired Ruth of his dreams . " I knew what that dinner was going to be , tonight , " Pearl told Cody . " I 'm not so dumb . I knew . He 's got himself engaged ; he 's going to marry the country cook . I knew that anyway but it all came home to me when I walked in the restaurant and saw those five plates and glasses . Well , I acted badly . Very badly . You do n't have to tell me , Cody . It was just that I saw those plates and something broke inside of me . I thought , Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be , but not tonight , just not tonight , Lord , right on top of buying wedding dress number two for my only daughter . ' So then , why , I went and made a scene that caused the dinner to be canceled , exactly as if I 'd planned it all ahead of time , which of course I had n't . You believe me , do n't you ? I 'm not blind . I know when I 'm being unreasonable . Sometimes I stand outside my body and just watch it all , totally separate . Now , stop , ' I say to myself , but it 's like I 'm . . . elated ; I 've got to rush on , got to keep going . Yes , yes , I 'll stop , ' I think , only let me say this one more thing , just this one more thing ... ' " Cody , do n't you believe I want you three to be happy ? Of course I do . Naturally . Why , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so set on marrying that girl  --  though I do n't know what he sees in her , she 's so scrappy and hoydenish ; I think she 's from Garrett County or some such place and hardlyp141wears shoes  --  you ought to see the soles of her feet sometime  --  hut what I want to say is , I 've never been one of those mothers who try to keep their sons for themselves . I honestly hope Ezra marries . I truly mean that . I want somebody taking care of him , especially him . You can manage on your own but Ezra is so , I do n't know , defenseless . . . Of course I love you all the same amount , every bit the same , but . . . well , Ezra is so good . You know ? Anyway , now he has this Ruth person and it 's changed his whole outlook ; watch him sometime when she walks into a room , or swaggers , or whatever you want to call it . He adores her . They get all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they remind me of puppies , snuggling down and giggling , or bounding about the kitchen or listening to that hillbillymusic that Ruth seems to be so crazy about . But , Cody . Promise not to tell this to anyone . Promise ? Cody , sometimes I stand there watching them and I see they believe they 're completelyspecial , the first , the only people ever to feel the way they 're feeling . They believe they 'll live happily ever after , that all the other marriages going on around them  --  those ordinary , worn-down , flattened-in arrangements  --  why , those are nothing like what they 'll have . They 'll never settle for so little . And it makes me mad . I ca n't help it , Cody . I know it 's selfish , but I ca n't help it . I want to ask them , Who do you think you are , anyhow ? Do you imagine you 're unique ? Do you really suppose I was always this difficult old woman ? ' " Cody , listen . I was special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach out and lay a fingertip on his arm while he was talking and he would instantly fall silent and get all confused . I had hopes ; I was courted ; I had the most beautiful wedding . I had three lovely pregnancies , where every morning I woke up knowingsomething perfect would happen in nine months , eight months , seven . . . so it seemed I was full of light ; it was light and plans that filled me . And then while you children were little , why , I was the center of your worlds ! I was everything to you ! It was Mother this and Mother that , and Where 's Mother ? Where 's she gone to ? ' and the moment you came in from school , Mother ? Are you home ? ' It 's not fair , Cody . It 's reallyp142not fair ; now I 'm old and I walk along unnoticed , just like anyone else . It strikes me as unjust , Cody . But do n't tell the others I said so . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power drills were fitted into their housings , Cody watched the old , dark Ruth fade from the rafters and hallways , until at last she was completely gone and he forgot why she had moved him so . Now a new Ruth appeared . Skinny and boyish , overalls flapping around her shinbones , she raced giggling down the assembly line with Ezra hot on her heels . Ezra 's hair was tousled . ( He was not immune at all , it appeared , but had only been waiting in his stubbornly trustful way for the proper person to arrive . ) He caught her in the supervisor 's office and they scuffled like ... yes , like two puppies . A cowlick bounced on the crown of Ruth 's head . Her lips were chapped and cracked . Her nails were bitten into tiny pink cushions and there were scrapes and burns across her knuckles , scars from her country cooking . Cody called his mother and said he 'd be down for the weekend . And would Ruth be around , did she think ? After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know his future sister-in-law . He arrived on Saturday morning bringing flowers , coppercoloredroses . He found Ruth and Ezra playing gin on the living room floor . Ruth 's reality , after his week of dreaming , struck him like a blow . She seemed clearer , plainer , harder edged than anybody he 'd known . She wore jeans and a shirt of some ugly brown plaid . She was so absorbed in her game that she hardly glanced up when Cody walked in . " Ruth , " he said , and he held out the flowers . " These are for you . " She looked at them , and then drew a card . " What are they ? " she asked . " Well , roses . " " Roses ? This early in the year ? "  | " Greenhouse roses . I especially ordered copper , to go with your hair . " " You leave my hair out of this , " she said . " Honey , he meant it as a compliment , " Ezra told her . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , it 's my way of saying welcome . Welcome to our family , Ruth . " " Oh . Well , thanks . " " Cody , that was awfully nice of you , " Ezra said . " Gin , " said Ruth . Late that afternoon , when it was time to go to the restaurant , Cody walked over with Ruth and Ezra . He 'd had a long , immobileday  --  standing outside other people 's lives , mostly  --  and he needed the exercise . It had been raining , off and on , and there were puddles on the sidewalk . Ruth strode straight through every one of them , which was fine since her shoes were brown leather combat boots . Cody wondered if her style were deliberate . What would she do , for instance , if he gave her a pair of high-heeled evening sandals ? The question began to fascinate him . He became obsessed ; he developed an almost physical thirst for the sight of her blunt little feet in silver straps . There was no explaining his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calibrated , capable of withstanding a deep-sea dive  --  whose stainless steel expansion band hung loose on her wiry wrist . Ezra had his pearwood recorder . He played it as he walked , serious and absorbed , with his lashes lowered on his cheeks . " Le Godiveau de Poisson , " he played . Passersby looked at him and smiled . Ruth hummed along with some notes , fell into her own thoughts at others . Then Ezra put his recorder in the pocket of his shabby lumber jacket , and he and Ruth began discussing the menu . It was good they were serving the rice dish , Ruth said ; that always made the Arab family happy . She ran herp144fingers through her sprouty red hair . Cody , walking on the other side of her , felt her shift of weight when Ezra circled her with one arm and pulled her close . In the restaurant , she was a whirlwind . Ezra cooked in a dream , tasting and reflecting ; the others ( losers , all of them , in Cody 's opinion ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounced and jabbed at food as if doing battle . She was in charge of a chicken casserole and something that looked like potato cakes . Cody watched her from a corner well out of the way , but still people seemed to keep tripping over him . " Where did you learn to cook ? " he asked Ruth . " No place , " she said . " Is this chicken some regional thing ? " " Taste , " she snapped , and she speared a piece and held it out to him . " I ca n't , " he said . " Why not ? " " I feel too full . " In fact , he felt full of her . He 'd taken her in all day , consumedher . Every spiky movement  --  slamming of pot lids , toss of head  --  nourished him . It came to him like a gift , while he was studying her narrow back , that she actually wore an undershirt , one of those knitted singlets he remembered from his childhood . He could make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed the information with care , to be treasured once he was alone . The restaurant opened and customers began to trickle in . The large , beaming hostess seated them all in one area , as if tucking them under her wing . " Find a table , " Ezra told Cody . " I 'll bring you some of Ruth 's cooking . " " I 'm honestly not hungry , " Cody said . " He 's full , " said Ruth , spitting it out . " Well , what 'll you do , then ? Is n't this boring for you ? " " No , no , I 'm interested , " Cody said . He could look across the counter and into the dining room ,  |p145where  people sat chewing and swallowing and drinking , patting their mouths with napkins , breaking off chunks of bread . He wondered how Ezra could stand to spend his life at this . When the first real flurry was over , Ruth and Ezra settled at the scrubbed wooden table in the center of the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chicken casserole . Ruth lit a small brown cigarette and tipped back in her chair to watch him . The cigarette smelled as if it were burning only by accident  --  like something spilled on the floor of an oven , or stuck to the underside of a saucepan . Cody , seated across from her , drank it in . " Eat , Cody , eat , " Ezra urged him . Cody just shook his head , not wanting to lose his chestful of Ruth 's smoke . Meanwhile , the other cooks came and went , some of them sitting also to wolf various odd assortments of food while their kettles simmered untended . Ezra 's boyhood friend Josiah appeared , metamorphosed into an efficient grown man in starchy white , and he and Ruth had a talk about peeling the apples for her pie . Cody could not have cared less about her pie , but he was riveted by her offhand , slangy style of speech . She held her cigarette between thumb and index finger , with her elbow propped against her rib cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knotted brows her eyes were so pale a blue that he was startled . They left the restaurant before it closed . Josiah would lock up , Ezra said . They took a roundabout route home , down a quiet , one-way street , to drop Ruth off at the house where she rented a room . When Ezra accompanied her up the front steps , Cody waited on the curb . He watched Ezra kiss her good night  --  a bumbling , inadequate kiss , Cody judged it ; and he felt some satisfaction . Then Ezra rejoined him and galumphed along beside him , big footed and blithe . " Is n't she something ? " he asked Cody . " Do n't you just love her ? " " Mm . " " But there 's so much I need to find out from you ! I want to take good care of her , but I do n't know how . What about lifep146insurance ? Things like that ! So much is expected of husbands , Cody . Will you help me figure it out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He meant it , too . Anything : any little crack that would provide him with an entrance . Eventually , Ezra subsided , although he continued to give the impression of inwardly bubbling and chortling . From time to time , he hummed a few bars of something underneath his breath . And then when they were almost home  --  passing houses totally dark , where everyone had long since gone to sleep  --  what should he do but pull out that damned recorder of his and start piping away . It was embarrassing . It was infuriating : " Le Godiveau de Poisson , " once again . Depend on Ezra , Cody thought , to have as his theme song a recipe for a seafood dish . He walked along in silence , hoping someone would call the police . Or at least , that they 'd open a window . " You there ! Quiet ! " But no one did . It was so typical : Ezra the golden boy , everybody 's favorite , tootling down the streets scot-free . On Sunday morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the door of the faded , doughy lady who owned the house Ruth stayed in . This lady toyed so fearfully with the locket at her throat that Cody felt compelled to take a step backward , proving he was not a knock-and-rob man . He gave her his most gentlemanly smile . " Good morning , " he said . " Is Ruth home ? " " Ruth ? " He realized he did n't know Ruth 's last name . " I 'm Ezra Tull 's brother , " he said . " Oh , Ezra , " she said , and she stood back to let him enter . He followed her deep into the interior , past a tumult of overstuffedfurniture and dusty wax fruit and heaps of magazines . In the kitchen , Ruth slouched at the table spooning up cornflakesand reading a newspaper propped against a cereal box . A pale , pudgy man stood gazing into an open refrigerator . Cody had an impression of inertia and frittered lives . He felt chargedp147with energy . It ought to be so easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . Ruth looked up . The pudgy man retreated behind the refrigerator door . " I hope you 're not too far into that cereal , " Cody said . " I came to invite you to breakfast . " " What for ? " Ruth asked , frowning . " Well . . . not for any purpose . I 'm just out walking and I thought you might want to walk with me , stop off for doughnutsand coffee someplace . " " Now ? " " Of course . " " Is n't it raining ? " " Only a little bit . " " No , thanks , " she said . Her eyes dropped back to her newspaper . The landlady slid her locket along its chain with a miniature zipping sound . " What 's going on in the world ? " Cody asked . " What world ? " said Ruth . " The news . What does the newspaper say ? " Ruth raised her eyes , and Cody saw the page she had turned to . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , my horoscope . " " Your horoscope . " He looked to the landlady for help . The landlady gazed off toward a cabinet full of jelly glasses . " Well , what . . . um , symbol are you ? " Cody asked Ruth . " Hmm ? " " What astrological symbol ? " " Sign , " she corrected him . She sighed and stood up , finally forced to recognize his presence . Snatching her paper from the table , she stalked off toward the parlor . Cody made way for her and then trailed after . Her jeans , he guessed , had been bought at a little boys ' clothing store . She had no hips whatsoever . Her sweater was transparent at the elbows . " I 'm Taurus , " she said over her shoulder , " but all that 's rubbish , anyhow . Total garbage . "  | " Oh , I agree , " Cody said , relieved . She stopped in the center of the parlor and turned to him . " Look at here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a line of newsprint . " Powerful ally will come to your rescue . Accent today on high finance . " She lowered the paper . " I mean , who do they reckon they 're dealing with ? What kind of business am I supposed to be involved in ? " " Ridiculous , " said Cody . He was hypnotized by her eyebrows . They were the color of orange sherbet , and whenever she spoke with any heat the skin around them grew pink , darker than the eyebrows themselves . " Ignore innuendos from long-time foe , " she read , running a finger down the column . " Or listen to this other one : Clandestine meeting could solve mystery . Almighty God ! " she said , and she tossed the paper into an armchair . " You got to lead quite a life , to get anything out of your horoscope . " " Well , I do n't know , " Cody said . " Maybe it 's truer than you realize . " " Come again ? " " Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ought to be more adventurous , not just slave away in some restaurant , mope around a gloomy old boardinghouse ... " " It 's not so gloomy , " Ruth said , lifting her chin . " Well , but  --  " " And anyhow , I wo n't always be here . Me and Ezra , after we marry , we 're moving in above the Homesick . Then once we get us some money we plan on a house . " " But still , " said Cody , " you wo n't have anywhere near what those horoscopes are calling for . Why , there 's all the outside world ! New York , for instance . Ever been to New York ? " She shook her head , watching him narrowly . " You ought to come ; it 's springtime there . " " It 's springtime here , " she said . " But a different kind . " " I do n't see what you 're getting at , " she told him . " Well , all I want to say is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's so much you have n't seen yet ? "  | " Soon ? " she said . " I 'm pretty near twenty years old . Been rattling around on my own since my sixteenth birthday . Only thing I want is to settle down , sooner the better . " " Oh , " said Cody . " Well , have a good walk . " " Oh , yes , walk ... " " Do n't drown , " she told him , callously . At the door , he turned . He said , " Ruth ? " " What . " " I do n't know your last name . " " Spivey , " she said . He thought it was the loveliest sound he had ever heard in his life . The following weekend , he drove her out to see his farm . " I have seen all the farms I care to , " she said , but Ezra said , " Oh , you ought to go , Ruth . It 's pretty this time of year . " Ezra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation of a new meat locker for the restaurant . Cody had known that before he invited her . This time he brought her jonquils . She said , " I do n't know what I want with these ; there 's a whole mess in back by the walkway . " Cody smiled at her . He settled her in his Cadillac , which smelled of new leather . She looked unimpressed . Perversely , she was wearing a skirt , on the one occasion when jeans would have been more suitable . Her legs were very white , almost chalky . He had not seen short socks like hers since his schooldays , and her tattered sneakers were as small and stubby as a child 's . On the drive out , he talked about his plans for the farm . " It 's where I 'd like to live , " he said . " Where I want to raise my family . It 's a perfect place for children . " " What makes you think so ? " she asked . " When I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . " " Yes , but fresh air and home-grown vegetables , and thep150animals . . . Right now , the man down the road is tending my livestock , but once I move in full-time I 'm going to do it all myself . " " That I 'd like to see , " said Ruth . " You ever slopped a hog ? Shoveled out a stable ? " " I can learn , " he told her . She shrugged and said no more . When they reached the farm he showed her around the grounds , where she stared a cow down and gave a clump of hens the evil eye . Then he led her into the house . He 'd bought it lock , stock , and barrel  --  complete with bald plush sofa and kerosene stove in the parlor , rickety kitchen table with its drawerful of rusted flatware , 1958 calendar on the wall advertisingMallardy 's oystershell mixture for layers , extra rich in calcium . The man who 'd lived here  --  a widower  --  had died upstairs in the four-poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets and a quilt and down pillows , but that was his only change . " I do plan to fix things up , " he told Ruth , " but I 'm waiting till I marry . I know my wife might like to have a say in it . " Ruth removed a window lock easily from its crumbling wooden sash . She turned it over and peered at the underside . " I want a wife very much , " said Cody . She put back the lock . " I hate to be the one to tell you , " she said , " but smell that smell ? Kind of sweetish smell ? You got dry rot here . " " Ruth , " he said , " do you dislike me for any reason ? " " Huh ? " " Your attitude . The way you put me off . You do n't think much of me , do you ? " he said . She gave him an edgy , skewed look , evasive , and moved over to the stairway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair amount . " " You do ? " " But I know your type , " she said . " What type ? " " There were plenty like you in my school , " she said . " Oh ,  |p151sure  ! Some in every class , on every team  --  tall and real goodlooking , stylish , athletic , witty . Smooth-mannered boys that everything always came easy to , that always knew the proper way of doing things , and never dated any but the cheerleader girls , or the homecoming queen , or her maids of honor at the lowest . Passing me in the halls not even knowing who I was , nor guessing I existed . Or making fun of me sometimes , I 'm almost certain  --  laughing at how poor I dressed and mocking my freckly face and my old red hair  --  " " Laughing ! When have I ever done such a thing ? " " I 'm not naming you in particular , " she said , " but you sure do put me in mind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I think you 're perfect , " he said . " You 're the most beautiful woman I 've ever laid eyes on . " " See there ? " she asked , and she raised her chin , spun about , and marched down the stairs . She would n't answer anything else he said to her , all during the long drive home . It was a campaign , was what it was  --  a long and arduous battle campaign , extending through April and all of May . There were moments when he despaired . He 'd had too late a start , was out of the running ; he 'd wasted his time with those unoriginal , obvious brunettes whom he 'd thought he was so clever to snare while Ezra , not even trying , had somehow divined the real jewel . Lucky Ezra ! His whole life rested on luck , and Cody would probably never manage to figure out how he did it . Often , after leaving Ruth , Cody would be muttering to himself as he strode away . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . But at the same time , he had an underlying sense of exhilaration . Yes , he would have to say that he 'd never felt more alive , never more eager for each new day . Now he understood why he 'd lost interest in Carol or Karen , what's-her-name , the social worker who had n't found Ezra appealing . She 'd made it too easy . What he liked was the competition , the hope of emerging triumphant from a neck-and-neck struggle with Ezra ,  |p152his  oldest enemy . He even liked biding his time , holding himself in check , hiding his feelings from Ruth till the most advantageous moment . ( Was patience Ezra 's secret ? ) For , of course , this was n't an open competition . One of the contestants did n't even know he was a contestant . " Gosh , Cody , " Ezra said , " it 's been nice to have you around so much lately . " And to Ruth , " Go , go ; you 'll enjoy it , " when Cody invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Ruth 's brown cigarettes and smoked it in the farmhouse . ( The scent of burning tar filled his bedroom . If he 'd had a telephone , he would have forgotten all his strategies and called her that instant to confess he loved her . ) He stubbed out the butt in a plastic ashtray beside his bed . Then later he invited Ezra to look at his new calves , took him upstairs to discuss a leak in the roof , and led him to the nightstandwhere the ashtray sat . But Ezra just said , " Oh , was Ruth here ? " and launched into praise for an herb garden she was planting on top of the restaurant . Cody could n't believe that anyone would be so blind , so credulous . Also , he would have died for the privilege of having Ruth plant herbs for him . He thought of the yard out back , where he 'd always envisioned his wife 's kitchen garden . Rosemary ! Basil ! Lemon balm ! " Why did n't she come to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her herbs on my farm . " " Oh , well , the closer to home the fresher , " said Ezra . " But you 're kind to offer , Cody . " Oiling his rifles that night , Cody seriously considered shootingEzra through the heart . When he complimented Ruth , she bristled . When he brought her the gifts he 'd so craftily chosen ( gold chains and crystal flasks of perfume , music boxes , silk flowers , all intended to contrast with the ugly , mottled marble rolling pin that Ezra presented , clumsily wrapped , on her twentieth birthday ) , she generally lost them right away or left them wherever she happened to be . And when he invited her places , she only came along for the outing . He would take her arm and she 'd say , " Jeepers , I 'm not some old lady . " She would scramble over rocks and through forests in her combat boots , and Cody wouldp153follow , bemused and dazzled , literally sick with love . He had lost eight pounds , could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  and hardly slept at night . When he did sleep , he willed himself to dream of Ruth but never did ; she was impishly , defiantly absent , and daytimes when they next met he thought he saw something taunting in the look she gave him . He often found it difficult to keep their conversations going . It struck him sometimes  --  in the middle of the week , when he was far from Baltimore  --  that this whole idea was deranged . They would never be anything but strangers . What single interest , even , did they have in common ? But every weekend he was staggered , all over again , by her strutting walk , her belligerent chin and endearing scowl . He was moved by her musty , little-boyish smell ; he imagined how her small body could nestle into his . Oh , it was Ruth herself they had in common . He would reach out to touch the spurs of her knuckles . She would ruffle and draw back . " What are you doing ? " she would ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're up to , " his mother told him . " I beg your pardon ? " " I see through you like a sheet of glass . " " Well ? What am I up to , then ? " he asked . He really did hope to hear ; he had reached the stage where he 'd angle and connivejust to get someone to utter Ruth 's name . " You do n't fool me for an instant , " said his mother . " Why are you so contrary ? You 've got no earthly use for that girl . She 's not your type in the slightest ; she belongs to your brother , Ezra , and she 's the only thing in this world he 's ever wanted . If you were to win her away , tell me what you 'd do with her ! You 'd drop her flat . You 'd say , Oh , my goodness , what am I doing with this little person ? ' " " You do n't understand , " said Cody . " This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but I understand you perfectly . With the rest of the world I might not be so smart , but with my three children , why , not the least little thing escapes me . I know everything you 're after . I see everything in your heart , Cody Tull. "  | " Just like God , " Cody said . " Just like God , " she agreed . Ezra arranged a celebration dinner for the evening before Jenny 's wedding  --  a Friday . But Thursday night , Jenny phoned Cody at his apartment . It was a local call ; she said she was n't ten blocks away , staying at a hotel with Sam Wiley . " We got married yesterday morning , " she said , " and now we 're on our honeymoon . So there wo n't be any dinner after all . " " Well , how did all this come about ? " Cody asked . " Mother and Sam had a little disagreement . " " I see . " " Mother said . . . and Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sam , why not let 's just . . . ' Only I do feel bad about Ezra . I know how much trouble he 's gone to . " " By now , he ought to be used to this , " Cody said . " He was going to serve a suckling pig . " Had n't Ezra noticed ( Cody wondered ) that the family as a whole had never yet finished one of his dinners ? That they 'd fight and stamp off halfway through , or sometimes not even manage to get seated in the first place ? Well , of course he must have noticed , but was it clear to him as a pattern , a theme ? No , perhaps he viewed each dinner as a unit in itself , unconnected to the others . Maybe he never linked them in his mind . Assuming he was a total idiot . It was true that once  --  to celebrate Cody 's new business  --  they had made it all the way to dessert ; so if they had n't ordered dessert you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact was , they did order dessert , which was left to sag on the plates when their mother accused Cody of deliberately setting up shop as far from home as possible . There was a stiff-backed little quarrel . Conversation fell apart . Cody walked out . So technically , even that meal could not be considered finished . Why did Ezra go on trying ? Why did the rest of them go on showing up , was more to the point.  |p155In  fact , they probably saw more of each other than happy families did . It was almost as if what they could n't get right , they had to keep returning to . ( So if they ever did finish a dinner , would they rise and say goodbye forever after ? ) Once Jenny had hung up , Cody sat on the couch and leafed through the morning 's mail . Something made him feel unsettled . He wondered how Jenny could have married Sam Wiley  --  a scrawny little artist type , shifty eyed and cocky . He wondered if Ezra would cancel his dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pictured Ruth in the restaurant kitchen , her wrinkled little fingers patting flour on drumsticks . He scanned an ad for life insurance and wondered why no one depended on him  --  not even enough to require his insurance money if he should happen to die . He ripped open an envelope marked AMAZING OFFER ! and found three stationery samples and a glossy order blank . One sample was blue , with LMR embossed at the top . Another had a lacy PAULA , the P entwined with a morning-glory vine , and the third was one of those letters that form their own envelopes when folded . The flap was printed with butterflies and Mrs. Harold Alexander III , 219 Saint Beulah Boulevard , Dallas , Texas . He studied that for a moment . Then he took a pen from his shirt pocket , and started writing in an unaccustomed , backhand slant : Dear Ruth , Just a line to say hey from all of us . How 's the job going ? What do you think of Baltimore ? Harold says ask if you met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , dreamed he saw you with someone tall , black hair and gray eyes and gray suit . I said well , I certainly hope it 's a dream that comes true ! We have all been fine tho Linda was out of school one day last week . A case of " math test-itis " it looked like to me , ha ha ! She says to send you lots of hugs and kisses . Drop us a line real soon , hear ?  |p156Cody  felt he had just found the proper tone toward the end ; he was sorry to run out of space . He signed the letter Luv , Sue ( Mrs. Harold Alexander III ) , and sealed , stamped , and addressed it . Then he placed it in a business envelope , and wrote a note to his old college roommate in Dallas , asking if he would please drop the enclosed in the nearest mailbox . That weekend he did n't go home , and his reward was to dream about Ruth . She was waiting for a train that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peering into the windows of each passenger car as it slid by . He was so eager to reach her , to watch her expression ease when she caught sight of him , that he called her name aloud and woke himself up . He heard it echoing in the dark  --  not her name , after all , but some meaninglesssleep sound . For hours after that he tried to burrow back inside the dream , but he had lost it . The next morning he began another letter , on the sheet headed PAULA . In a curlicued script , he wrote : Dear Ruthie , You old thing , do n't you keep in touch with your friends any more ? I told Mama the other day , Mama that Ruth Spivey has forgotten all about us I believe . Things here are not going too good . I guess you might have heard that me and Norman are separated . I know you liked him , but you had no idea how tiresome he could be , always so slow and quiet , he got on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtful kind of men , they 're a real disappointment . Go for someone dark and interesting who will take you lots of places you 've never bccn . I 'm serious , I know what I 'm talking about . Mama sends you greetings and asks do you want her to sew you anything . She 's real crippled now with the arthritis in her knees and can only sit in her chair , has plenty of time for sewing . See ya , Paulap157That letter he mailed from Pennsylvania , when he visited a packing-crate plant the following Tuesday . And on Wednesday , from New York , he sent the blue sheet with LMR at the top . Dear Ruth , Had lunch with Donna the other day and she told me you were going with a real nice fellow . Was kind of hazy on the particulars but when she said his name was Tull and he came from Baltimore I knew it must be Cody . Everybodyhere knows Cody , we all just love him , he really is a good man at heart and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Well , Ruthie , I guess you 're smarter than I gave you credit for , I always thought you 'd settle for one of those dime-a-dozen blond types but now I see I was wrong . I 'll be waiting for the details . Love , Laurie May " You went too far with that last letter , " Ruth told him . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " He was sitting on a kitchen stool , watching her cube meat . He 'd come directly to the restaurant this Saturday  --  bypassing home , bypassing the farm  --  hoping to find her altered somehow , mystified , perhaps tossing him a speculative glance from time to time . Instead , she seemed cross . She slammed her cleaver on the chopping board . " Do you realize , " she asked , " that I went ahead and answered that first note ? Not wanting someone to worry , I sent it back and said it was n't mine , there must be some mistake ; went out specially and bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent the second back , too , only it did n't have a return address . Then the third comes ; well , you went too far . " " I tend to do that , " Cody said regretfully . Ruth slung the cleaver with a thunking sound . Cody was afraid the others  --  only Todd Duckett and Josiah , this early  --  would wonder what was wrong , but they did n't even look around . Ezra was out front , chalking up tonight 's menu.  | " Just what is your problem ? " Ruth asked him . " Do you have something against me ? You think I 'm some Garrett County hick that you do n't want marrying your brother ? " " Of course I do n't want you marrying him , " Cody said . " I love you . " " Huh ? " This was n't the moment he had planned , but he rushed on anyway , as if drunk . " I mean it , " he said , " I feel driven . I feel pulled . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about . " She was staring at him , astonished , with one hand cupped to scoop the meat cubes into a skillet . " I guess I 'm not saying it right , " he told her . " Saying what ? What are you talking about ? " " Ruth . I really , truly love you , " he said . " I 'm sick over you . I ca n't even eat . Look at me ! I 've lost eleven pounds . " He held out his arms , demonstrating . His jacket hung loose at the sides . Lately he 'd moved his belt in a notch ; his suits no longer fit so smoothly but seemed rumpled , gathered , bunchy . " It 's true you 're kind of skinny , " Ruth said slowly . " Even my shoes feel too big . " " What 's the matter with you ? " she asked . " You have n't heard a word I said ! " " Over me , you said . You must be making fun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're used to New York City girls , models , actresses ; you could have anyone . " " It 's you I 'll have . " She studied him a moment . It began to seem he 'd finally broken through ; they were having a conversation . Then she said , " We got to get that weight back on you . " He groaned . " See there ? " she asked . " You never eat a thing I offer you . " " I ca n't , " he told her . " I do n't believe you ever once tasted my cooking . " She set the skillet aside and went over to the tall black kettle that was simmering on the stove . " Country vegetable , " she said , lifting the lid.  | " Really , Ruth ... " She filled a small crockery bowl and set it on the table . " Sit down , " she said . " Eat . When you 've tried it , I 'll tell you the secret ingredient . " Steam rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spicy that already he felt overfed . He accepted the spoon that she held out . He dipped it in the soup reluctantly and took a sip . " Well ? " she asked . " It 's very good , " he said . In fact , it was delicious , if you cared about such things . He 'd never tasted soup so good . There were chunks of fresh vegetables , and the broth was rich and heavy . He took another mouthful . Ruth stood over him , her thumbs hooked into her blue jeans pockets . " Chicken feet , " she said . " Pardon ? " " Chicken feet is the secret ingredient . " He lowered the spoon and looked down into the bowl . " Eat up , " she told him . " Put some meat on your bones . " He dipped the spoon in again . After that , she brought him a salad made with the herbs she 'd grown on the roof and a basketful of rolls she 'd baked that afternoon  --  a recipe from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he ate , she watched him . When she brought him more butter for his rolls , she leaned close over him and he felt the warmth she gave off . Now two more cooks had arrived and a Chinese boy was sauteing black mushrooms , and Ezra was running a mixer near the sink . Ruth sat down next to Cody , hooking her combat boots on the rung of his chair and hugging her ribs . Cody cut into a huge wedge of pie and gave some thought to food  --  to its inexplicable , loaded meaning in other people 's lives . Could n't you classify a person , he wondered , purely by examining his attitude toward food ? Look at Cody 's mother  --  a nonfeeder , if ever there was one . Even back in his childhood , when they 'd depended on her for nourishment . . . why , mention you were hungry and she 'd suddenly act rushed and harassed , fretful , out of breath , distracted . He remembered her coming homep160from work in the evening and tearing irritably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell all over her  --  pork ' n ' beans , Spam , oily tuna fish , peas canned olivedrab . She cooked in her hat , most of the time . She whimpered when she burned things . She burned things you would not imagine it possible to burn and served others half-raw , adding jarring extras of her own design such as crushed pineapple in the mashed potatoes . ( Anything , as long as it was a leftover , might as well be dumped in the pan with anything else . ) Her only seasonings were salt and pepper . Her only gravy was Campbell 's cream of mushroom soup , undiluted . And till Cody was grown , he had assumed that roast beef had to be stringy  --  not something you sliced , but a leathery dry object which you separated with a fork , one strand from the other , and dropped with a clunk upon your plate . Though during illness , he remembered , you could count on her to bring liquids . Hot tea : she was good at that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she 'd stand in the door with her arms folded while you drank it . He remembered that her expression , when others ate or drank , conveyed a mild distaste . She ate little herself , often toyed with her food ; and she implied some criticism of those who acted hungry or overinterestedin what they were served . Neediness : she disapproved of neediness in people . Whenever there was a family argument , she most often chose to start it over dinner . Biting into Ruth 's flaky , shattering crust , Cody considered his mother 's three children  --  Jenny , for instance , with her lemonwaterand lettuce-leaf diets , never allowing herself a sweet , skipping meals altogether , as if continually bearing in mind that disapproving expression of her mother 's . And Cody himself was not much different , when you came right down to it . It seemed that food did n't count , with him ; food was something required by others , so that for their sakes  --  on dates , at business luncheons  --  he would obligingly order a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you 'd find in his refrigerator was cream for his coffee and limes for his gin and tonics . He never ate breakfast ; he often forgot lunch . Sometimes a gnawing feeling hitp161his stomach in the afternoon and he sent his secretary out for food . " What kind of food ? " she would ask . He would say , " Anything , I do n't care . " She 'd bring a Danish or an eggroll or a liverwurst on rye ; it was all the same to him . Half the time , he would n't even notice what it was  --  would take a bite , go on dictating , leave the rest to be disposed of by the cleaning lady . A woman he 'd once had dinner with had claimed that this was a sign of some flaw . Watching him dissect his fish but then fail to eat it , noticing how he refused dessert and then benignly , tolerantly waited for her to finish a giant chocolate mousse , she had accused him of . . . what had she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy himself . He had n't understood , back then , how she could draw so many implications from a single meal . And still he did n't agree with her . Yes , only Ezra , he would say , had managed to escape all this . Ezra was so impervious  --  so thickheaded , really ; nothing ever touched him . He ate heartily , whether it was his mother 's cookingor his own . He liked anything that was offered him , especiallybread  --  would have to watch his weight as he got older . But above all else , he was a feeder . He would set a dish before you and then stand there with his face expectant , his hands clasped tightly under his chin , his eyes following your fork . There was something tender , almost loving , about his attitude toward people who were eating what he 'd cooked them . Like Ruth , Cody thought . He asked her for another slice of pie . Mornings , now , he called her from New York , often getting her landlady out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaky voiced from sleep  --  or was it from bewilderment , even now ? Reluctantly , each time , she warmed to his questions , speaking shortly at first . Yes , she was fine . The restaurant was fine . Dinner last night had gone well . And then ( letting her sentences stretch gradually longer , as if giving in to him all over again ) she told him that this house was starting to wear her down  --  creepy boarders padding around in their slippers atp162all hours , no one ever going anywhere , landlady planted eternallyin front of her TV . This landlady , a widow , believed that Perry Como 's eyebrows quirked upward as they did because he was by nature a bass , and singing such high notes gave him constant pain ; she had heard that Arthur Godfrey , too , had been enduring constant pain for years , smiling a courageous smile and wheeling about on his stool because the slightest step would stab him like a knife . Yes , everything , to Mrs. Pauling , was a constant pain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking around her and wondering how she stood this place . Weekends  --  Friday and Saturday nights  --  Ruth tore through the restaurant kitchen slapping haunches of beef and whipping egg whites . Ezra worked more quietly . Cody sat at the wooden table . Now and then , Ruth would place some new dish in front of him and Cody would eat it dutifully . Every mouthful was a declaration of love . Ruth knew that . She was tense and watchful . She gave him sideways , piercing glances when he forked up one of her dumplings , and he was careful to leave nothing on his plate . Then on Sunday mornings , yellow summer mornings at her boardinghouse , he rang her doorbell and pulled her close to him when she answered . Anytime he kissed her , he was visited by the curious impression that some other self of hers was still moving through the house behind her , spunky and lighthearted and uncatchable even yet , checking under pot lids , slamming cupboard doors , humming and tossing her head and wiping her hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ezra told them . " Let me start over , " said Cody . Ezra said , " Is this some kind of a joke ? Is that what it is ? What is it ? " " Ruth and I  --  " Cody began . But Ruth said , " Ezra , honey . Listen . " She stepped forward . She was wearing the navy suit that Cody had bought her to go away in , and high-heeled shoes with slender straps . Althoughp163it was a glaring day in August , her skin had a chilled , dry , powdery look , and her freckles stood out sharply . She said , " Ezra , we surely never planned on this . We never had the least intention , not me or Cody neither one . " Ezra waited , evidently still not comprehending . He was backed against the huge old restaurant stove , as if retreating from their news . " It just happened , like , " said Ruth . " You do n't know what you 're saying , " said Ezra . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . It 's not true . " " See , I do n't know how it came about but me and Cody .. . and I should 've told you sooner but I kept thinking , oh , this is just some . . . I mean , this is silly ; he 's so sophisticated , he is n't someone for me ; this is just some . . . daydream , see ... " " There 's bound to be an explanation , " Ezra said . " I feel real bad about it , Ezra . " " I 'm sure I 'll understand in a minute , " he said . " Just give me time . Just wait a minute . Let me think it through . " They waited , but he did n't say anything more . He pressed two fingers against his forehead , as if working out some complicatedpuzzle . After a while , Cody touched Ruth 's arm . She said , " Well , Ezra , goodbye , I guess . " Then she and Cody left . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fuss but sniffling quietly and keeping her face turned toward the side window . " Are you all right ? " Cody asked . She nodded . " You 're sure you still want to go on with this . " She nodded again . They were planning to travel by train  --  Ruth 's idea ; she had never set foot on a train  --  to New York City , where they would be married in a civil ceremony . Ruth 's people , she said , were mostly dead or would n't much care ; so there was n't any point having the wedding in her hometown . And it went without saying that Cody 's people . . . well . For the next little bit , they might as well stay in New York . By and by , things would simmer down.  |p164Ruth  took off one of her gloves , already gray at the seams , and crumpled it into a ball and blotted both her eyes . Near Penn Station , Cody found a parking lot that offered weekly rates . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth it for Ruth 's sake . She was already perking up . She asked him if he thought there 'd be a dining car  --  an " eating car , " she called it . Cody said he imagined so . He accepted the ticket the parking attendant gave him and slid out from behind the steering wheel , grunting a little ; lately he 'd put on a few pounds around the waist . He took Ruth 's suitcase from the trunk . Ruth was n't used to high heels and she hobbled along unsteadily , every now and then making a loud , scraping sound on the sidewalk . " I hope to get the knack of these things before long , " she told Cody . " You do n't have to wear them , you know . " " Oh , I surely do , " she said . Cody guided her into the station . The sudden , echoing coolnessseemed to stun her into silence . She stood looking around her while Cody went to the ticket window . A lady at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A man in a crisp white suit rolled his eyes at Cody , implying exasperation at the wait . Cody pretended not to notice . He turned away as if checking the length of the line behind him , and a plump young woman with a child smiled instantly , fully prepared , and said , " Cody Tull ! " " Um  --  " " I 'm Jane Lowry . Remember me ? " " Oh , Jane ! Jane Lowry ! Well , good to see you , how nice to ... and is this your little girl ? " " Yes ; say hello to Mr. Tull , Betsy . Mr. Tull and Mommy used to go to school together . " " So you 're married , " Cody said , moving forward in line . " Well , what a  --  " " Remember the day I came to visit you , uninvited ? " she asked . She laughed , and he saw , in the tilt of her head , a flash of the young girl he had known . She had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the most beautiful hair , whichp165still showed its chips of gold light , although she wore it short now . " I had such a crush on you , " she said . " Lord , I made a total fool of myself . " " You played a game of checkers with Ezra , " he reminded her . " Ezra ? " " My brother . " " You had a brother ? " " I certainly did ; do . You played checkers with him all after-noon . " " How funny ; I thought you only had a sister . What was her name ? Jenny . She was so skinny , I envied her for years . Anythingshe wanted , she could eat and not have it show . What 's Jenny doing now ? " " Oh , she 's in medical school . And Ezra : he runs a restaurant . " " In those days , " said Jane , " my fondest wish was to wake up one morning and find I 'd turned into Jenny Tull . But I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak , but the man in white had moved away and it was Cody 's turn at the window . And by the time he 'd bought his tickets , Jane had switched to the other line and was busy buying hers . He did n't see her again  --  though he looked for her on the train  --  but it was odd how she 'd plunged him into the past . Swaying on the seat next to Ruth , holding her small , rough hand but finding very little to say to her , he was startled by fragments of buried memories . The scent of chalk in geometry class ; the balmy , laden feeling of the last day of school every spring ; the crack of a baseball bat on the playground . He found himself in a summer evening at a drive-in hamburger stand , with its blindinglights surrounded by darkness , its hot , salty , greasy smell of French fries , and all his friends horsing around at the curb . He could hear an old girlfriend from years ago , her droning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say yes and then you change your mind and ask me bowling instead and I say yes to that but you say wait , let 's make it another night , as if anything you can have is something it turns out you do n't want ... " He heard his mother telling Jenny not to slouch , telling Codyp166not to swear , asking Ezra why he would n't stand up to the neighborhood bully . " I 'm trying to get through life as a liquid , " Ezra had said , and Cody ( trying to get through life as a rock ) had laughed ; he could hear himself still . " Why are n't cucumbers prickly any more ? " he heard Ezra ask . And " Cody ? Do n't you want to walk to school with me ? " He saw Ezra aiming a redfeathereddart , his chapped , childish wrist awkwardly angled ; he saw him running for the telephone  --  " I 'll get it ! I 'll get it ! "  --  hopeful and joyous , years and years younger . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's faults  --  a motherly man , she 'd said ; what had she said ?  --  and it occurred to him that the reason he had dropped her was , she really had n't understood Ezra ; she had n't appreciated what he was all about . Then Ruth squeezed his hand and said , " I intend to ride trains forever ; it 's so much better than the bus . Is n't it , Cody ? Cody ? Is n't it ? " The train rounded a curve with a high , thin , whistling sound that took him by surprise . He honestly believed , for an instant , that what he 'd heard was music  --  a tune piped , a burble of notes , a little scrap of melody floating by on the wind and breaking his heart.  |p167Twice  or maybe three times a year , she goes out to the farm to make sure things are in order . She has her son Ezra drive her there , and she takes along a broom , a dustpan , rags , a grocery bag for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra asks why she ca n't just keep these supplies in the farmhouse , but she knows they would n't be safe . The trespassers would get them . Oh , the trespassers  --  the small boys and courting couples and the teen-aged gangs . It makes her mad to think of them . As the car turns off the main road , rattling up the rutted driveway , she already sees their litter  --  the beer cans tossed among the scrubby weeds , the scraps of toilet paper dangling from the bushes . This land has been let go and the vegetation is matted and wild , bristly , scratchy , no shade at all from the blazing sun . There are little spangles of bottle tops embedded in the dirt of the road . And the yard ( which is not truly mown but sickled by Jared Peers , once or twice a summer ) is flocked with white paper plates and Dixie cups , napkins , sandwich bags , red-striped straws , and those peculiarly long-lived , accordioned worms of paper that the straws were wrapped in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a shame . A disgraceand a shame , " Pearl says , stepping out . She wears a seersuckerdress that will wash , and her oldest shoes . On her head is a broad-brimmed straw hat . It will keep the dust from herp168hair  --  from all but one faded , blondish frizz bordering each temple . " It 's a national crime , " she says , and she stands looking around her while Ezra unloads her cleaning supplies . The house has two stories . It is a ghostly , rubbed-out gray . The ridgepole sags and the front porch has buckled and many of the windowpanesare broken  --  more every time she comes . She remembers when Cody first showed her this place . " Imagine what can be done with it , Mother . Picture the possibilities , " he said . He was planning to marry and raise a family here  --  provide her with lots of grandchildren . He even kept the livestock on , paying Jared Peers to tend it till Cody moved in . That was years ago , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of ragged hens gone wild , clucking in the mulberry tree out behind the barn . She has a key to the warped rear door but it is n't needed . The padlock 's missing and the rusted hasp hangs open . " Not again , " she says . She turns the knob and enters , warily . ( One of these days , she 'll surprise someone and get her head blown off for her trouble . ) The kitchen smells stale and cold , even in the heat of the day . There 's a fly buzzing over the table , a rust spot smearingthe back of the sink , a single tatter of cloudy plastic curtain trailing next to the window . The linoleum 's worn patternless near the counters . Ezra follows , burdened with household supplies . He sets them down and stands wiping his face on the sleeve of his work shirt . More than once he 's told her he fails to see the use of this : cleaning up only to clean again , the next time they come out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why go to all this trouble , what does she have in mind ? But he 's an obliging man , and when she insists , he says no more . He runs his fingers through his hair , which the sweat has turned a dark , streaked yellow . He tests the kitchen faucet . First it explodes and then it yields a coppery trickle of water . There are half a dozen empty bottles lying on the floor  --  Wild Turkey , Old Crow , Southern Comfort . " Look ! And look , " says Pearl . She nudges a Marlboro pack with her toe . She scrapes at a scorch on the table . She discreetly looks away while Ezrap169hooks an unmentionable rubber something with the broom handle and drops it into the trash bag . " Cody , " she used to say , " you could hire a man to come and haul this furniture off to the dump . Surely you do n't want it for yourself . Cody , there 's a Sunday suit in the bedroom closet . There are shoes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old garden shoes . You ought to hire a man to come haul them for you . " But Cody paid no attention  --  he was hardly ever there . He was mostly in New York ; and privately , Pearl had expected that that was where he would stay . Which of those girlfriends of his would agree to a life in the country ? " You 'd just better watch out who you marry , " she had told him . " None of your dates that I 've met would do  --  those black-haired , flashy , beautyqueentypes . " But if only he 'd married one of them ! If only he 'd been satisfied with that ! Instead , one afternoon Ezra had come into the kitchen , had stood there looking sick . " What 's wrong ? " she 'd asked . She knew it was something . " Ezra ? Why are n't you at work ? " " It 's Cody , " he said . " Cody ? " She clutched at her chest , picturing him dead  --  her most difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the answer to him . But Ezra said , " He 's gone off to get married . " " Oh , married , " she said , and she dropped her hand . " Well ? Who to ? " " To Ruth , " he said . " Your Ruth ? " " My Ruth . " " Oh , sweetheart , " she said . Not that she had n't had some inkling . She had seen it coming for weeks , she believed , though she had n't exactly seen marriage  --  more likely a fling , a flirtation , another of Cody 's teases . Should she have hinted to Ezra ? He would n't have listened . He was so gullible , and so much in love . Ruth was the center of his world , for some reason . And anyway , who would have thoughtp170that Cody would let it get so serious ? " He 's just doing it to be mean , sweetheart , " she told Ezra . She was right , too , as she 'd been right the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other times ! Those inconsequential spats , those childhood quarrels , arguments , practical jokes ! " Cody , stop it this instant , " she used to tell him . " You think I do n't see what you 're up to ? Let your poor brother alone . Ezra , pay no mind . He 's only being mean . " Back then , Ezra had listened and nodded , hoping to believe her ; he had doted on his older brother . But now he said , " What does it matter why he did it ? He did it , that 's all . He stole her away . " " If she could be stolen , honey , why , you do n't want her anyhow . " Ezra just looked at her  --  bleak faced , grim , a walking ache of a man . She knew how he felt . Had n't she been through it ? She remembered from when her husband left  --  a wound , she 'd been , a deep , hollow hole , surrounded by shreds of her former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floor , collects the bottles and the cigarette packs . Meanwhile , Ezra tapes squares of cardboard to the broken windowpanes . He works steadily , doggedly . She looks up once and sees how the sweat has made an eagle-shaped stain across his back . There are other cardboardsquares on other panes , broken earlier . In a few more seasons , it occurs to her , they 'll be working in the dark . It 's as if they 're sealing themselves in , windowpane by windowpane . When Cody carne back with Ruth , after the honeymoon , he was better-looking than ever , sleek and dark and well dressed , but Ruth was her same homely self : a little muskrat of a girl with wickety red hair and freckles , her skin that tissue-thin kind subject to lip sores and pink splotches , her twiggish body awkward in a matronly brown suit that must have been bought especially for this occasion . ( Though Pearl was to find , in later years , that all Ruth 's clothes struck her that way ; nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear with Ezra . ) Pearl watched the two of them sharply , closely , anxious to come to some conclusion about their marriage , but they gave away no secrets . Ruth sat pressing her palms together ; Cody kept his arm across the back of the couch , not touchingp171her but claiming her , at least . He talked at length about the farm . They were heading out there directly , settling in that night . It was too late for sowing a garden but at least they could clean the place up , begin to make plans for next spring . Ruth was going to get started on that while Cody went back to New York . Ruth nodded at this , and cleared her throat and fumbled with the pocket of her suit jacket . Pearl thought she was reaching for one of her little cigars , but after a moment she stopped fumbling and placed her palms together again . And in fact , Pearl never saw her smoke another one of those cigars . Then Ezra arrived  --  not whistling , oddly quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stopped inside the door and looked at them . " Ezra , " Cody said easily , and Ruth stood up and held out her hand . She seemed frightened . This made Pearl like her , a little . ( Ruth , at least , recognized the magnitude of what they 'd done . ) " How you doing , Ezra , " Ruth said , quavering . And Ezra had said . . . oh , something or other , he 'd managed something ; and stood around a while shifting from foot to foot and answering their small talk . So it looked , on the surface , as if they might eventually smooth things over . Yes , after all , this choosing of mates was such a small , brief stage in a family 's history . But Ezra no longer played tunes on his recorder , and he continued to look limp and beaten , and he went to bed every night with no more than a " Good night , Mother . " She grieved for him . She longed to say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're worth a dozen Ruth Spiveys ! A dozen of both of them , to be frank , even if Cody is my son ... " Though of course she loved Cody dearly . But from infancy , he had batted her away ; and his sister had been so evasive , somehow ; so whom did that leave but Ezra ? Ezra was all she had . He was the only one who would let her in . Sometimes , in his childhood , she had worried that he would die young  --  one of life 's ironic twists , to take what you valued most . She had watched him trudging down the street to school , his duck-yellow head bowed in thought , and she would have a sudden presentiment that this was the last she would see of him . Then when he returned , full of news about friends andp172ball games , how solid , how commonplace  --  even how irritating  --  he seemed ! And sometimes , long ago when he was small , he might climb up into her lap and place his thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his smell of warm biscuits and think , " Really , this is what it 's all about . This is what I 'm alive for . " Then , reluctantly , she allowed him to slip away again . ( They claimed she was possessive , pushy . Little did they know . ) As a child , he 'd had a chirpy style of talking that was so cheerful , ringing through the house like a trill of water . . . when had that begun to change ? As an older boy he grew shy and withdrawn , gazing out of shining gray eyes and saying next to nothing . She 'd worried when he did n't date . " Would n't you like to bring someone home ? Ask someone to Sunday dinner ? " He shook his head , tongue-tied . He blushed and lowered his long lashes . Pearl wondered , seeing the blush , whether he thought much about girls and such as that . His father had left by then and Cody was no help , three years older , off tomcatting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ... well , to be honest , he was not much different from when he was a boy . In a way , he was an eternal boy , never got boastful and brash like most men but stayed gentle , somber , contentedly running that restaurant of his and coming home peaceful and tired . It was a shock when he introduced her to Ruth . What an urchin she was ! But plainly , Ezra adored her . " Mother , I 'd like you to meet my  --  meet Ruth . " Pearl had stalled a little , at first . Maybe she had failed to act properly welcoming . Well , who could blame her ? And now , seeing how things had turned out , who could say she 'd been wrong ? But she ca n't help wondering , anyhow . . . If she 'd been a little more encouraging , they might have married sooner . They might have married before Cody could work his mischief . Or if she had let herself realize ... Yes , she wonders over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ezra , stopped that situation that was not so much a courtship as a landslide , a kind of gathering and falling of events . . . Ridiculous , of course , to imagine that anything she did could have mattered . What happens , happens . It 's no one 's fault . ( Orp173it 's only Cody 's fault , for he has always been striving and competitive , a natural-born player of games , has had to win absolutelyeverything , even something he does n't want like a runty little redhead far below his usual standards . ) She opens the farmhouse parlor to air it . It smells like skunk . She leaves the front door ajar , taking care not to step onto the porch , which could very well give way beneath her . She remembershow , toward the end of that first week after the honeymoon , she asked Ezra to bring out to Ruth a few odds and ends for the farm  --  some extra pans , some linens , a carpet sweeper she had no use for . Was there an ulterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she accompany him , visit the bride like any good mother-in-law ? " Please , I do n't want to , " Ezra said , but she said , " Honey . Go . " She had n't had any consciousdesign  --  truly , none at all  --  but it was a fact that later that morning , dawdling over the dishes , she 'd allowed herself a little daydream : Ezra coming up behind Ruth , setting his arms around her , Ruth protesting only briefly before collapsing against him . . . Oh , should n't it be possible to undo what was done ? What all of them had done ? But Ezra when he returned was as subdued as ever , and only said that Ruth thanked Pearl for the pans and linens but was sending back the carpet sweeper as the farmhouse had no carpets . Then Saturday , Cody came storming in with everything Ezra had taken to Ruth . " What 's all this ? " he asked Pearl . " Why , Cody , pots and sheets , as you can surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I asked him to , " she said . " I wo n't have it ! Wo n't have him hanging around the farm . " " Cody . It was at my request . Believe me , " she told him . " I do , " he said . She tried to get Ezra to go again the following week  --  taking the rug from the dining room and the carpet sweeper , once more  --  but he would n't . " I 'm not comfortable there , " he said . " There 's no point . What 's the point ? " She supposed he was right . Yes , she thought , let Ruth wonder where he 'd got to ! People who leave us will be sorry in the end . She imaginedp174Ruth alone in the farmhouse , roaming from room to room and peering sadly through the bare windows . The next weekend , Pearl asked Ezra to drive her out . He could n't very well refuse ; he was her only means of transportation . They both , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing . They found the house looking sealed and abandoned . A lone hound nudged at a bone in the yard , but he surely did n't belong there . " Back home , Pearl placed a call to Cody in New York . " Are n't you coming to the farm any more ? " " Things are kind of busy . " " Wo n't Ruth be there during the week ? " " I want her here with me , " he said . " After all , we just did get married . " " Well , when will we see you ? " " Pretty soon , not too long , I 'm sure we 'll be down in a while ... " But they were n't ; or if they were , they did n't tell Pearl , and she was too proud to ask again . The summer ended and the leaves turned all colors , but Ezra dragged himself along with no change . " Sweetheart , " Pearl told him , as in his boyhood , " is n't there someone you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Anyone , " she said . Ezra said no . From time to time , Pearl called Cody in New York again . He was courteous and noncommittal . Ruth , if she spoke , gave flustered replies and did n't seem to have her wits about her . Then in October , two full weeks went by when no one answered the phone at all . Pearl wondered if they 'd gone to the farm , and she begged Ezra to investigate . But when he finally agreed to , he found nobody there . " Someone 's shattered four windowpanes , " he reported . " Threw rocks at them , or shot them out . " This made Pearl feel frightened . The world was closing in on them ; even here on her own familiar streets , she no longer felt safe . And who knew what might have become of Ruth and Cody ? They could be lying dead in their apartment , victims of a burglary or some bizarre , New York  --  type accident , their bodies undiscovered for weeks . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family ! It was n't right ; with your family , if with no one else , you have to keep on trying . She called frantically , day after day , often letting the phone ring thirty or forty times . There was something calming about that faraway purling sound . She was , at least , connected  --  though only to an object in Cody 's apartment . Then he answered . It was late in October . She was so taken aback that she did n't know what to say . It seemed the monotonousring of the phone had grown to be enough for her . " Um , Cody ... " she said . " Oh . Mother . " " Cody , where have you been ? " " I had a job to see to in Ohio . I took Ruth along . " " You did n't answer the phone for weeks , and we looked for you out at the farm and some of the windows were broken . " " Damn ! I thought I was paying Jared to keep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine how I felt , Cody . When I heard about the windows I felt . . . You 're letting that place go to rack and ruin and we never get to see you any more . " " I do have a job to do , Mother . " " I thought that once you married , you were moving down to Baltimore . You were doing over the farmhouse and planting a garden and all . " " Yes , definitely . That 's a definite possibility , " said Cody . " Get Ezra to tape those windows , will you ? And tell him to speak to Jared . I ca n't have the place depreciating . " " All right , Cody , " she said . Then she asked about Thanksgiving . " Will you be coming down ? You know how Ezra likes to have us at the restaurant . " " Oh , Ezra and his restaurant ... " " Please . We 've hardly seen you , " she said . " Well , maybe . " So in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incongruous in a large , ornate blue dress . Her hair was so stubby , her head so small , that the dress appeared to bep176drowning her . She staggered in her high-heeled shoes . She still would not meet Ezra 's gaze . " What have you two been up to ? " Pearl asked Ruth , as they rode in Cody 's Cadillac to the restaurant . " Oh , nothing so much . " " Are you decorating Cody 's apartment ? " " Decorating ? No . " " We 've hardly seen it , " Cody said . " I 'm taking on longertermjobs . In December I start reorganizing a textile plant in Georgia , a big thing , five or six months . I thought maybe Ruth could come with me ; we could rent us a little house of some kind . There 's not much point in commuting . " " December ? But then you 'd miss Christmas , " said Pearl . Cody looked surprised . He said , " Why would we miss it ? " " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh . Well , no , I guess not , " he said . " But we 're here forThanksgiving , are n't we ? " She resolved to say no more . She had her dignity . They sat at their regular family table , surrounded by a fairsizedcrowd . ( In those days  --  the start of the sixties  --  shaggy young people had just discovered Ezra 's restaurant , with its stripped wood and pure , fresh food , and they thronged there every evening . ) It was sad that Jenny could n't come ; she was spending the holiday with her in-laws . But Ruth , at least , rounded out their number . Pearl smiled across the table at her . Ruth said , " It feels right funny to be eating where I used to be cooking . " " Would you like to visit the kitchen ? " Ezra asked . " The staff would enjoy seeing you . " " I do n't mind if I do , " she said . It was the first time since her marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first that Pearl knew about . So Ezra scraped back his chair and rose , and guided Ruth into the kitchen . Pearl could tell that Cody was n't pleased . He stopped in the act of unfolding his napkin and gazed after them , even taking a breath as if preparing to object . Then hep177must have thought better of it . He shook out the napkin angrily , saying nothing . " So , " said Pearl . " When do you move to the farm ? " " Farm ? Oh , I do n't know , " he said . " Everything 's so changed ; the whole character of my work has changed . " He looked again toward the kitchen . " But you 'd planned on raising a family there . It was all you ever talked about . " " Yes , well , and these long-term contracts , " he said , as if he had n't heard her . Pearl said , " You had your heart just set on it . " But he continued watching the other two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be saying . The kitchen was fully exposed , and could not have concealed the smallest secret . So why was Cody nervous ? Ezra and Ruth stood talking with one of the cooks , their backs to the dining room . Ezra gestured as he spoke . He lifted both arms wide , one arm behind Ruth but not touching her , not brushing her shoulder , surely not encircling her or anything like that . Even so , Cody rose abruptly from his chair . " Cody ! " Pearl said . He strode toward the kitchen , with his napkin crumpled in one fist . Pearl stood up and hurried after him , and arrived in time to hear him say , " Let 's go , Ruth . " " Go ?  --  " I did n't come here to watch you and Ezra chumming it up in the kitchen . " Ruth looked scared . Her face seemed to grow more pointed . " Come on , " said Cody , and he took her elbow . " Goodbye , " he told Pearl and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after them . " Oh , Cody , what can you be thinking of ? How can you act so foolish ? " Cody yanked Ruth 's coat from a brass hook in passing . He opened the front door and pulled Ruth into the street and shut the door behind them . Ezra said , " I do n't understand . " Pearl said , " Why does it always turn out this way ? Howp178come we end up quarreling ? Do n't we all love each other ? Everything else aside , " she said , " do n't we all want the best for one another ? " " Certainly we do , " Ezra said . His answer was so level and firm that she felt comforted . She knew things were bound to work out someday . She let him lead her back to the table , and the two of them had a forlorn turkey dinner on the wide expanse of white linen . Upstairs there are four bedrooms , sparsely furnished , musty . The beds are so sunken-looking , evidently even the courting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched , the drab , dirty quilts still smooth . But a dead bird lies beneath one window . Pearl calls down the stairwell . " Ezra ? Ezra , come here this instant . Bring the broom and trash bag . " He mounts the stairs obediently . She looks down and sees , with a pang , that his lovely fair hair is thinning on the back of his head . He is thirty-seven years old , will be thirty-eight in December . He will probably never marry . He will never do anything but run that peculiar restaurant of his , with its hodgepodgeof food , its unskilled waitresses , its foreign cooks with questionable papers . You could say , in a way , that Ezra has suffered a tragedy , although it 's a very small tragedy in the eyes of the world . You could say that he and Ruth , together , have suffered a tragedy . Something has been done to them ; something has been taken away from them . They have lost it . They are lost . It does n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  that he 's bright and funny and genuinely kind , to everyonebut Ezra . You could almost say that Cody , too , has suffered a tragedy . In 1964 , when she went out to Illinois to visit them , she felt in their house the thin , tight atmosphere of an unhappy marriage . Not a really terrible marriage  --  no sign of hatred , spitefulness , violence . Just a sense of something missing . A certain failure to connect , between the two of them . Everything seemed so tenuous . Or was it her imagination ? Maybe she wasp179wrong . Maybe it was the house itself  --  a ranch house in a development , rented for the four months or so that Cody would need to reorganize a plastics plant in Chicago . Plainly the place was expensive , with wall-to-wall carpeting and long , low , modernfurniture ; but there were no trees anywhere nearby , not even a bush or a shrub  --  just that raw brick cube rising starkly from the flatness . And outside it was so white-hot , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its artificial , refrigerated air . They were imprisoned by the house , dependent upon it like spacemen in a spaceship , and when they went out it was only to dash through a crushing weight of heat to Cody 's air-conditioned Mercedes . Ru , : h , going about her chores every day , had the clenched expression of someone determined to surviveno matter what . Cody came home in the evening gasping for oxygen  --  barely crawling over the doorsill , Pearl fantasized  --  but did not seem all that relieved to have arrived . When he greeted Ruth , they touched cheeks and moved apart again . It was the first time Pearl had ever visited them , the first and only time , and this was after years of very little contact at all . They seldom came to Baltimore . They never returned to the farm . And Cody wrote almost no letters , though he would telephone on birthdays and holidays . He was more like an acquaintance , Pearl thought . A not very cordial acquaintance . Once she and Ezra were driving down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harper 's Ferry , when they chanced to come up behind a man in jogging shorts . He was running along the edge of the highway , a tall man , dark , with a certain confident , easy swing to his shoulders . . . Cody ! Out here in the middle of nowhere , by sheer coincidence , Cody Tull ! Ezra slammed on his brakes , and Pearl said , " Well , did you ever . " But then the jogger , hearing their car , had turned his face and he was n't Cody after all . He was someone entirely different , beefy jawed , nowhere near as handsome . Ezra sped up again . Pearl said , " How silly of me , I know full well that Cody 's in , ah ... " " Indiana , " said Ezra . " Indiana ; I do n't know why I thought ... " They were both quiet for several minutes after that , and inp180those minutes Pearl imagined the scene if it really had been Cody  --  if he had turned , astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't envision stopping . She thought of how his mouth would fall open as he recognized their faces behind the glass ; and how they would gaze out at him , and smile and wave , and skim on by . Whenever he phoned he was cheerful and hearty . " How 've you been , Mother ? " " Why , Cody ! " " Everything all right ? How 's Ezra ? " Oh , on the phone he was so nice about Ezra , interested and affectionate like any other brother . And on the rare occasions when he and Ruth came through Baltimore  --  heading somewhere else , just briefly dropping in  --  he seemed so pleased to shake hands with Ezra and clap him on the back and ask what he 'd been up to . At first . Only at first . Then : " Ruth ! What are you and Ezra talking about , over there ? " Or : " Ezra ? Do you mind not standing so close to my wife ? " When Ezra and Ruth were hardly speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hurt to watch . " Cody . Please . What are you imagining ? " Pearl would ask him , and then he would turn on her : " Naturally , you would n't see it . Naturally , he can do no wrong , can he , Mother . Your precious boy . Can he . " She had given up , finally , on ever being asked to visit . When Cody called and told her Ruth was pregnant , some two or three years into the marriage , Pearl said , " Oh , Cody , if she 'd like it at all , I mean when the baby arrives . . . if she 'd like me to come take care of things . . . " But evidently , she was n't needed . And when he called to say that Luke was born  --  nine pounds , three ounces ; everything fine  --  she said , " I ca n't wait to see him . I honestly ca n't wait . " But Cody let that pass . They sent her photos : Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping bear-style across the carpet , on hands and feet instead of knees . ( Cody had crept that way too . ) Lukep181uncertainly walking , with a clothespin in each fat fist . He had to have the clothespins , Ruth wrote , because then he thought he was holding on to something . Otherwise , he fell . Now that photos were arriving , letters came too , generally written by Ruth . Her grammar was shocking and she could n't spell . She said , Me and Cody - urrecken Luke 's eyes are going to stay blue , but what did Pearl care about grammar ? She saved every letter and put Luke 's pictures on her desk in little gilt frames she bought at Kresge 's . I think I ought to come see Luke before he 's grown , she wrote . No one answered . She wrote again . Would June be all right ? Then Cody wrote that they were moving to Illinois in June , but if she really wanted then maybe she could come in July . So she went to Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers on their way to Vietnam , and she spent a week in that treeless house barricaded against the elements . It was a shock , even to her , how instantly and how deeply she loved her grandson . He was not quite two years old by then , a beautiful baby with a head that seemed adult in its shape  --  sharply defined , the golden hair trimmed close and neat . His firm , straight lips seemed adult as well , and he had an unchildlikeway of walking . There was a bit of slump in his posture , a little droop to his shoulders , nothing physically wrong but an air of resignation that was almost comical in someone so small . Pearl sat on the floor with him for hours , playing with his trucks and cars . " Vroom . Vroom . Roll it back to Granny , now . " She was touched by his stillness . He had a sizable vocabulary but he used it only when necessary ; he was not a spendthrift . He was careful . He lacked gaiety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child ? She saw that Cody had a sprinkling of gray in his sideburns , a more leathery look to his cheeks ; but that Ruth was still a scrappy little thing in too-short hair and unbecoming dresses . She had not grown fuller or softer with age . She was like certain supermarket vegetables that turn from green to withered withoutp182ever ripening . In the evenings , when Cody came home from work , Ruth clattered around the kitchen cooking great quantities of country food that Cody would hardly touch ; and Cody had a gin and tonic and watched the news . The two of them asked each other , " How was your day ? " and " Everything fine ? " but they did n't seem to listen to the answers . Pearl could believe that in the morning , waking in their king-sized bed , they asked politely , " Did you sleep all right ? " She felt oppressed and uncomfortable , but instead of averting her gaze she was for some reason compelled to delve deeper into their lives ; she sent them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then ransacked all the desk drawers but found only tax receipts , and bank statements , and a photo album belonging to the people who really lived here . Anyway , she could n't have said what it was she was looking for . Coming home , jouncing on the train amid another group of soldiers , she felt weary and hopeless . She arrived in Baltimore seven hours late , with a racking headache . Then as she entered the station , she saw Ezra walking toward her in his plodding way and she felt such a stab of . . . well , recognition . It was Luke 's walk , solemn little Luke . Life was so sad , she thought , that she almost could n't bear it . But kissing Ezra , she felt her sorrow overtaken by something very like annoyance . She wondered why he put up with this , why he let things go on this way . Could it be that he took some satisfaction in his grief ? ( As if he were paying for something , she thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , he asked , " How 'd you like Luke ? " and she said , " Do n't you ever think of just going there and trying to get her back ? " " I could n't , " he said , unsurprised , and he maneuvered the car laboriously from its parking slot . " Well , I do n't see why not , " she told him . " It 's not right . It 's wrong . " She was n't given to philosophy , but during the drive home she stared at the grimy Baltimore scenery and considered the question of right and wrong : of theoretical virtue , existing in a vacuum ; of whether there was any point to it at all . Whenp183they reached home , she got out of the car and entered the house without a word , and climbed the stairs to her room . Ezra scoops the dead bird onto a piece of cardboard and slides it into the trash bag . Then he tapes the cardboard to the broken windowpane where the bird must have entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . She leaves them in a pyramid and goes downstairs for the dustpan . Already , she sees , the house has a bit more life to it  --  the sunny pattern of leaves shimmering on the parlor floor in front of the open door , the smell of hot grass wafting through the rooms . " It was never all that practical , " Cody said on the phone just recently , referringto the farm . " It was only a half-baked idea that I had when I was young . " But if he really meant that , why does n't he go on and sell ? No , he could n't possibly ; she has spent so much time sweeping this place , preparing it for him , opening and shutting bureau drawers as if she 'd find his secrets there . She can imagine Ruth in this kitchen , Cody out surveying fence lines or whatever it is men do on farms . She can picture Luke running through the yard in denim overalls . He is old enough to go fishing now , to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend the animals . In August , he 'll be eight . Is it eight ? Or nine . She 's lost track . She hardly ever sees him , and must conquer his shyness all over again whenever he and his parents pass through Baltimore . Each visit , his interests have changed : from popguns to marbles to stamp collecting . Last time he was here , some two or three years back , she got out her husband 's stamp album  --  its maroon , fake-leather cover gone gray with mildew  --  only to find that Luke had switched to model airplanes . He was assembling a balsa wood jet , he told her , that would actually fly . And he was planning to be an astronaut . " By the time I 'm grown , " he said , " astronauts will be ordinary . People will be taking rockets like you would take a bus . They 'll spend their summers on Venus . They wo n't go to Ocean City ; they 'll go to beaches on the moon . " " Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she was too old for such things.  |p184She  could n't keep up , and the very thought of traveling to the moon made her feel desolate . ' ' And nowadays  --  well , who can guess ? Luke must be involved in something entirely different . It 's so long since he was here , and she 's not sure he 'll ever be back . During that last visit , Ezra got his old pearwood recorder from the closet and showed Luke how to play a tune . Pearl knows very little about recorders , but evidently something happens  --  the wood dries up , or warps , or something  --  when they 're not played enough ; and this one had n't been played in a decade , at least . Its voice had gone splintery and cracked . How startled she 'd been , hearing three ancient notes tumble forth after such a silence ! Ezra and Luke walked south on Calvert Street to buy some linseed oil . Not two minutes after they left , Cody asked where they 'd got to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pearl told him . " Did n't you see them go ? " Cody excused himself and went outside to pace in front of the house . Ruth stayed in the living room , discussing schools . Pearl hardly listened . She could look through the window and see Cody pacing , turning , pacing , his suit coat whipping out behind him . She could tell when Ezra and Luke returned , even before she saw them , by the way that Cody stiffened . " Where have you been ? " she heard him ask . " What have you two been doing ? " Luke never did learn how to play the recorder . Cody said they had to go . " Oh , but Cody ! " Pearl said . " I thought you were spending the night ! " " Wrong , " he told her . " Wrong again . I ca n't stay here ; this place is not safe . Do n't you see what Ezra 's up to ? " " What , Cody ? What is he up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal my son ? " he asked . " The same way he always stole everybody ? Do n't you see ? " In the end , they left . Ezra wanted to give Luke the recorder for keeps , but Cody told Luke to leave it ; he 'd get him a newer one , fancier , finer . One that was n't all dried up , he said . Pearl believes now that her family has failed . Neither of her sons is happy , and her daughter ca n't seem to stay married . There is no one to accept the blame for this but Pearl herself ,  |p185who  raised these children single-handed and did make mistakes , oh , a bushel of mistakes . Still , she sometimes has the feeling that it 's simply fate , and not a matter for blame at all . She feels that everything has been assigned , has been preordained ; everyonemust play his role . Certainly she never intended to foster one of those good son/bad son arrangements , but what can you do when one son is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sons do , even ? " Do n't you see ? " Cody had cried , and she had imagined , for an instant , that he was inviting her to look at his whole existence  --  his years of hurt and bafflement . Often , like a child peering over the fence at somebody else 's party , she gazes wistfully at other families and wonders what their secret is . They seem so close . Is it that they 're more religious ? Or stricter , or more lenient ? Could it be the fact that they participate in sports ? Read books together ? Have some common hobby ? Recently , she overheard a neighbor woman discussing her plans for Independence Day : her family was having a picnic . Every member  --  child or grownup  --  was cookinghis or her specialty . Those who were too little to cook were in charge of the paper plates . Pearl felt such a wave of longing that her knees went weak . Ezra has finished taping the glass . Pearl drifts through the other bedrooms , checking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little old lady in a hat approaches . It 's Pearl , in the speckled mirror above a bureau . She leans closer and traces the lines around her eyes . Her age does not surprise her . She 's grown used to it by now . You 're old for so much longer than you 're young , she thinks . Really it hardly seems fair . And then she thinks , for no earthly reason , of a girl she went to school with , Linda Lou something-or-other  --  such a pretty , flighty girl , someone she 'd always envied . In the middle of their senior year , Linda Lou disappeared . There were rumors , later confirmed  --  an affair with the school 's only male teacher , a married man ; and a baby on the way . How horrified her class/mates had been ! It had thrilled them : that they actually knew such a person , had borrowed her history notes , helped her retie a loose sash , perhaps even brushed her hand accidentally  --  that hand that may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It occurs to Pearl , peering into the glass , that the baby born of that scandal must be sixty years old by now . He would have gray hair and liver spots , perhaps false teeth , bifocals , a tedious burden of a life . Yet Linda Lou , wearing white , still dances in Pearl 's mind , the prettiest girl at the senior social . " Do n't you see ? " Cody has asked , and Pearl had said , " Honey , I just ca n't understand you . " Then he shrugged , and his normal , amused expression returned to his face . " Ah , well , " he said , " I ca n't either , I guess . After all , what do I care , now I 'm grown ? Why should it matter any more ? " She does n't recall if she managed any reply to that . She steps away from the mirror . Ezra comes in , bearing the trash bag . " All finished , Mother , " he says . " It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looks just fine , " he tells her . They descend the stairs , and close the door , and carry their supplies to the car . As they drive away Pearl glances back , like any good housewife checking what she 's cleaned , and it seerns to her that even that buckling front porch is straighter and more solid . She has a feeling of accomplishment . Others might have given up and let the trespassers take the place over , but never Pearl . Next season she will come again , and the season after , and the season after that , and Ezra will go on bringing her  --  the two of them bumping down the driveway , loyal and responsible , - together forever.  | " Whoever 's the first to mention divorce has to take the children , " Jenny said . " This has kept us together more times than I can count . " She was joking , but the priest did n't laugh . He may have been too young to catch it . All he did was shift uncomfortably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something bubbling , like something churning , and the baby dribbled on his shoes . He withdrew his feet imperceptibly , as if trying not to hurt the baby 's feelings . " Yet I believe , " he said , appearing to choose his words , " that you yourself have been divorced , have you not ? " " Twice , " said Jenny . She giggled , but he only looked worried . " And once for Joe here , " she added . Her husband smiled at her from the sofa . " If I had n't had the foresight to keep my maiden name , " Jenny said , " my medical diploma would read like one of those address books where people have moved a lot . Names crossed out and added , crossed out and added  --  a mess ! Dr. Jenny Marie Tull Baines Wiley St. Ambrose . " The priest was one of those very blond men with glasslike hair , and his color was so high that Jenny wondered about his blood pressure . Or maybe he was just embarrassed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urn  --  or Dr.  --  "  | " Tull . " " Dr. Tull , I only thought that the . . . instability , the lack of stability , might be causing Slevin 's problems . The turnover in fathers , you might say . " " In fathers ? What are you talking about ? " Jenny asked . " Slevin 's not my son . He 's Joe 's . " " Ah ? " " Joe is his father and always has been . " " Oh , excuse me , " said the priest . He grew even pinker  --  as well he ought , Jenny felt ; for slow , plump Slevin with his ashy hair was obviously Joe 's . Jenny was small and dark ; Joe a massive , blond , bearded bear of a man with Slevin 's slanted blue eyes . ( She had often felt drawn to overweight men . They made her feel tidy . ) " Slevin , " she told the priest , " is Joe 's by Greta , his previous wife , and so are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Becky ; Becky 's mine . The other six are his . " She bent to take the dog 's bone from the baby . " Anyway . . . but Joe 's wife , Greta : she left . " " Left , " said the priest . " Left me flat , " Joe said cheerfully . " Cleared clean out of Baltimore . Parked the kids with a neighbor one day , while I was off at work . Hired an Allied van and departed with all we owned , everything but the children 's clothes in neat little piles on the floor . " " Oh , my stars , " said the priest . " Even took their beds . Can you explain that ? Took the crib and the changing table . Only thing I can figure , she was so used to life with children that she really could n't imagine ; really assumed she would need a crib no matter where she went . First thing I had to do when I got home that night was go out and buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ght I was opening a motel . " " Picture it , " Jenny said . " Joe in an apron . Joe mixing Similac . Well , he was lost , of course . Utterly lost . The way we met : he called me at home in the dead of night when his baby got roseola . That 's how out of touch he was ; it 's been twenty years at least since pediatricians made house calls . But I came , I don'tp189know why . Well , he lived only two blocks away . And he was so desperate  --  answered the door in striped pajamas , jiggling the baby  --  " " I fell in love with her the moment she walked in , " said Joe . 1 le stroked his beard ; golden frizz flew up around his stubby fingers . " He thought I was Lady Bountiful , " Jenny said , " bearing a medical bag instead of a basket of food . It 's hard to resist a man who needs you . " " Need had nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who admires you , then . He asked if I had children of my own , and how I managed while I worked . And when I said mostly played it by ear , with teen-aged sitters one minute and elderly ladies the next , my mother filling in when she could or my brother or a neighbor , or Becky sometimes just camping in my waiting room with her math assignment  --  " " I could see she was n't a skimpy woman , " Joe told the priest . " Not rigid . Not constricted . Not that super-serious kind . " " No , " said the priest , glancing around him . ( It had n't been a day when Jenny could get to the housework . ) Jenny said , " He said he liked the way I let his children crawl all over me . He said his wife had found them irritating , the last few years . Well , you see how it began . I had promised myself I 'd never remarry , Becky and I would rather manage on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't know , there Joe was , and his children . And his baby was so little and so recently abandoned that she turned her head and opened her mouth when I held her horizontal ; you could tell she still remembered . Anyway , " she said , and she smiled at the priest , who really was shockingly young  --  a wide-eyed boy , was all . " How did we get on this subject ? " " Uh , Slevin , " said the priest . " We were discussing Slevin . " " Oh , yes , Slevin . " It was a rainy , blowy April afternoon , with the trees turning inside out and beating against the windowpanes , and the living room had reached just that shade of dusk where no one had realized , quite yet , that it was time to switch on the lights . Thep190air seemed thick and grainy . The children were winding down like little clocks and fussing for their suppers ; but the priest , lacking children of his own , failed to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've been concerned , " he said , " by Slevin 's behavior at C.Y.O. meetings . He 's not sociable at all , has no friends , seems moody , withdrawn . Of course it could be his age , but . . . he 's fourteen , is he ? " " Thirteen , " said Joe , after thinking it over . " Thirteen years old , naturally a difficult . . . I would n't even mention it , except that when I suggested we have a talk he just wrenched away and ran out , and never returned . Now we notice that you , Mr. St. Ambrose , that you drop him off for mass every Sunday , but in fact he 's stopped coming inside and simply sits out front on the steps and watches the traffic . He 's , you might say , playing hooky , but  --  " " Shoot , " said Joe . " I get up specially on a Sunday morning to drive him there and he plays hooky ? " " But my point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to go anyhow . He 's the only one of them that does . " " But it 's his withdrawn behavior that worries me , " the priest said , " more than his church attendance . Though it might not be a bad idea if , perhaps , you accompanied him to mass some-time . " " Me ? Hell , I 'm not even Catholic . " " Or I do n't suppose you , Dr. Tull ... " Both men seemed to be waiting for her . Jenny was wondering about the baby 's diaper , which bulged suspiciously , but she gathered her thoughts and said , " Oh , no , goodness , I really would n't have the faintest  --  " She laughed , covering her mouth  --  a gesture she had . " Besides , " she said , " it was Greta who was the Catholic . Slevin 's mother . " " I see . Well , the important thing  --  " " I do n't know why Slevin goes to church . And to Greta 's church , her old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he communicate with his mother now ? " " Oh , no , she 's never been back . Got a quickie divorce in Idaho and that 's the last we heard . " " Are there any , ah , step-family problems ? " " Step-family ? " Jenny said . " Well , no . Or yes . I do n't know . There would be , probably ; of course these things are never easy . . . only life is so rushed around here , there really is n't time . " " Slevin is very fond of Jenny , " Joe told the priest . " Why , thank you , honey , " Jenny said . " She won him right over ; she 's got him trailing after her anyplace she goes . She 's so cool and jokey with kids , you know . " " Well , I try , " Jenny said . " I do make an effort . But you never can be sure . That age is very secretive . " " Perhaps I 'll suggest that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you like . " " Just to gab , I 'll say , chew the fat ... " Jenny could see that it would never work out . She walked him to the door , strolling with her hands deep in her skirt pockets . " I hope , " she said , " you have n't got the wrong idea about us . I mean , Joe 's an excellent father , honestly he is ; he 's always been good with Slevin . " " Yes , of course . " " Oh , when I compare him with some others I could name ! " Jenny said . She had a habit , with disapproving people , of talking a little too much , and she knew it . As they crossed the hall , she said , " Sam Wiley , for instance  --  my second husband . Becky 's father . You 'd die if you ever saw Sam . He was a painter , one of those graceful compact small types I 've never trusted since . Totally shiftless . Totally unreliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a model named Adar Bagned . " She opened the front door . A fine , fresh mist blew in and she took a deep breath . " Oh , lovely , " she said . " But is n't that a hilarious name ? For the longest time I kept trying to turn itp192around , thinking it must make more sense if I read it off backward . Goodbye , then , Father . Thanks for dropping in . " She closed the door on him and went off to fix the children 's supper . This would be a very nice house , Jenny was fond of saying , if only the third-floor bathtub did n't drain through the dining room ceiling . It was a tall , trim Bolton Hill row house ; she 'd bought it back in ' 64 , when prices were n't yet sky-high . In those days , it had seemed enormous ; but seven years later , with six extra children , it did n't feel so big any more . It was inconvenient , warrenlike , poorly arranged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to find space for the furniture . She cooked at a sticky , stilt-legged stove , rinsed greens at a yellowed sink skirted with chintz , set plates on a table that was carved with another family 's initials . " Here , children , everyone get his own silver , now  --  " " You gave Jacob more peas than me . " " She did not . " " Did too . " " Did not . " " Did too . " " Take them ! I do n't even like them . " " Where 's Slevin ? " Jenny asked . " Who needs Slevin anyhow , the old grouch . " The telephone rang and Joe came in with the baby . " That 's your answering service , they want to know  --  " " I 'm not on ; it 's Dan 's night on . What are they calling me for ? " " That 's what I thought , but they said  --  " He wandered off again , and returned a minute later to settle at the table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , " Jenny said , flying past . " Her spoon is on the ... " She left the kitchen , climbed the stairs to the second floor and called up to the third . " Slevin ? " No answer . She climbedp193the rest of the way , quickly growing breathless . How out of shape she was ! It was true , as her mother was forever telling her , that she had let herself go  --  a crime , her mother said , for anyone with Jenny 's good looks . It was true that she 'd become a bit haggard , slackened somewhat , her skin turning sallow and her eyebrows shaggy and her wide , amused mouth a dry brownishcolor now that she wore no lipstick . " Your hair ! " her mother mourned . " Your lovely hair ! "  --  which was n't lovely at all : a thick , blunt , gray-threaded clump with boxy bangs . " You used to be such a beauty , " Pearl would say , and Jenny would laugh . A fat lot of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was wearing her beauty out  --  using it up , she liked to think . She took some satisfaction in it , like a housewife industriously making her way through a jar of something she did not enjoy , would not buy again , but could n't just discard , of course . Panting , clutching a handful of denim skirt , she arrived on the third floor . It was the older children 's floor , not her territory , and it had a musty , atticky smell . " Slevin ? " she called . She knocked at his door . " Supper , Slevin ! " She opened the door a crack and peered in . Slevin lay on his unmade bed with his forearm over his eyes . A wide strip of blubbery belly showed , as it nearly always did , between jeans and T-shirt . He had his earphones on ; that was why he had n't heard . She crossed the room and lifted the earphones from his head . A miniature Janis Joplin song rang out tinnily : " Me and Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , like someone just waking . " Suppertime , " she told him . " I 'm not hungry . " " Not hungry ! What kind of talk is that ? " " Jenny , honest , I just do n't want to get up . " But she was already pulling him to his feet  --  a burly boy nearly Jenny 's height and considerably heavier but still babyish , creamy skinned . She propelled him to the door , pushing from behind with both palms flat on the small of his back . " You 're the only one of them that I have to carry bodily to meals , " she said . She sang him down the stairs :  | " Oh , they had to carry Harry to the ferry , And they had to carry Harry to the shore ... " " Seriously , Jenny , " Slevin said . They entered the kitchen . Joe made a trumpet of his hands above the baby 's head and said , " Ta-ra ! Ta-ra ! He approaches ! " Slevin groaned . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her place next to Joe , gazing around at the tableful of children , Jenny felt pleased . They were doing well , she decided  --  even the older ones , who 'd acted so wary and hostile when she had first met them . Then she had an unsettling thought : it occurred to her that this would have to be her permanent situation . Having taken on these children , straightened their upturned lives and slowly , steadily won their trust , she could not in good conscience let them down . Here she was , forever . " It 's lucky we get along , " she said to Joe . " It 's extremely lucky , " he said , and he patted her hand and asked for the mustard . " Is n't it amazing how school always smells like school , " Jenny told Slevin 's teacher . " You can add all the modern conveniences you like  --  audiovisual things and computers  --  it still smells like book glue and that cheap gray paper they used to have for arithmetic and also . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another smell besides . I know it but I ca n't quite name it . " " Have a seat , Dr. Tull , " the teacher said . " Radiator dust , " said Jenny . " Pardon ? " " That 's the other smell . " " I called you in for a purpose , " said the teacher , opening the file that lay before her . She was a tiny thing , surely not out of her twenties , perky and freckled with horn-rimmed glasses dwarfing her pointed nose . Jenny wondered how she 'd learned to be so intimidating so quickly . " I know you 're a busy woman ,  |p195Dr  . Tull , but I 'm genuinely anxious about Slevin 's school performanceand I thought you ought to be informed . " " Oh , really ? " Jenny said . She decided she would feel better if she too wore glasses , though hers were only needed for reading . She dug through her purse and a pink plastic pacifier fell out . She pretended it had n't happened . " Slevin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She glared at Jenny accusingly . " He goes straight off the top of the charts . " " Yes , I figured that . " " But his English average . . . " the teacher said , flipping through papers . " It 's F. Well , maybe D minus . " Jenny clicked her tongue . " Math : C. History : D. And science . . . and gym . . . He 's had so many absences , I finally asked if he 'd been cutting school . Yes , ma'am , ' he said  --  came right out with it . What did you cut ? ' I asked him . February , ' he said . " Jenny laughed . The teacher looked at her . Jenny straightened her glasses and said , " Do you think it might be puberty ? " " All these children are going through puberty , " the teacher told her . " Or . . . I do n't know ; boredom . You said yourself he 's intelligent . Why , you ought to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereos . . . He 's got a tape recorder of his own , he worked for it and bought it himself , some superduper model , offhand I ca n't think of the name . I 'm such a dunce about these things , when he talked about head cleaners I thought he meant shampoo ; but Slevin knows all about it and  --  " " Mr. Davies suggests , " said the teacher , "  --  that 's our assistant principal  --  he suggests that Slevin may be experiencing emotionalproblems due to the adjustments at home . " " What adjustments ? " " He says Slevin 's mother abandoned him and Slevin was moved to your household almost immediately thereafter and had to get used to a brand-new mother and sister . "  | " Oh , that , " said Jenny , waving her hand . " Mr. Davies suggests that Slevin might need professional counseling . " " Nonsense , " Jenny said . " What 's a little adjustment ? And anyhow , that happened a good six months ago . It 's not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's had to get used to seven new people and she 's never said a word of complaint . Oh , we 're all coping ! In fact my husband was saying , just the other day , we should think about having more children now . We ought to have at least one joint child , he says , but I 'm not so sure myself . After all , I 'm thirty-six years old . It probably would n't be wise . " " Mr. Davies suggests  --  " " Though I suppose if it means so much to him , it 's all the same to me . " " The same ! " said the teacher . " What about the population explosion ? " " The what ? You 're getting me off the subject , here . . . My point is , " Jenny said , " I do n't see the need to blame adjustment , broken homes , bad parents , that sort of thing . We make our own luck , right ? You have to overcome your setbacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll explain all that to Slevin . I 'll tell him this evening . I 'm certain his grades will improve . " Then she bent to pick up the pacifier , and shook hands with the teacher and left . On the wall in Jenny 's office was a varnished wooden plaque : DR . TULL IS NOT A TOY . Joe had made it for her in his workshop . He was incensed by the scrapes and bruises that Jenny gathered daily in her raucous games with her patients . " Make them show some respect , " he told her . " Maintain a little dignity . " But the sign was all but lost among her patients ' snapshots ( on beaches , on seesaws , on photographers ' blanketed tables , or behind lit birthday cakes ) and the crayoned self-portraits they 'd brought her . Anyhow , most of them were too young to read . She scooped up Billy Burnham and carried him , squawking and giggling , top197the nurse for his tetanus shot . " Now , it 's possible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll experience a little soreness in his left  --  " Billy squirmed , and a button popped off Jenny 's white coat . The Albright baby was due for a DPT shot . The Carroll baby had to have her formula switched . Lucy Brandon 's constant sniffle looked like an allergy ; Jenny told Mrs. Brandon where she could take her for testing . Both the Morris twins ' tonsils were swollen . She asked the receptionist to order her a sandwich , but the receptionist said , " Are n't you eating out ? Your brother 's here ; he 's been waiting half an hour , at least . " " Oh , my Lord , I forgot all about him , " Jenny said . She went into the waiting room . Ezra was seated on the vinyl couch , surrounded by pull toys and building blocks and oilcloth picture books . A family of Spanish-speaking children , probably patients of Dr. Ramirez , played at his feet , but you 'd never mistake Ezra for a parent . His shaggy yellow hair was soft as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face was wide and expectant . " Ezra , honey , " Jenny told him , " I clean forgot . My next appointment 's in twenty minutes ; do you suppose we could just grab a hamburger ? " " Oh , surely , " Ezra said . He waited while she took off her white coat and put on a raincoat . Then they rode the elevator down to the marblepavedlobby , and pushed through the revolving door onto a spattery , overcast street . There was a smell like wet coal . Huddledpeople hurried by and buses wheezed and cathedral bells rang far away . " I feel dumb , " Jenny said , " taking you of all people to a humburger joint . " She was thinking of his restaurant , which always intimidated her a little . Recently , Ezra had remodeled the living quarters above it into a series of tiny , elegant private dining rooms like those in old movies  --  the velvet-hung compartments where the villain attempts to seduce the heroine . They 'd be perfect for anniversary couples , Ezra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , annoyingly sentimental about marriage . ) But so far , only business groups and heavily jeweled Baltimore politicianshad asked to use the rooms . Now he said , " A hamburger 's fine ; I 'm crazy about hamburgers . " And when they walked through the plate glass doorway , into a slick , tiled area lined with glaring photos of onion rings and milkshakes , he looked around him happily . Secretaries clustered at some tables , construction workers at others . " It 's getting like a collective farm , " Ezra said . " All these chain places that everyone comes to for breakfast , lunch , sometimes supper ... like a commune or a kibbutz or something . Pretty soon we wo n't have private kitchens at all ; you just drop by your local Gino 's or McDonald 's . I kind of like it . " Jenny wondered if there were any eating place he would n't like . At a soup kitchen , no doubt , he 'd be pleased by the obvioushunger of the customers . At a urine-smelling tavern he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen anywhere else . Oh , if it had to do with food , he was endlessly appreciative . While he ordered for them , she settled herself at a table . She took off her raincoat , smoothed her hair , and scraped at a Pablum spot on her blouse . It felt strange to be sitting alone . Always there was someone  --  children , patients , colleagues . The empty space on either side of her gave her an echoing , weightlessfeeling , as if she lacked ballast and might at any moment float upward . Ezra returned with their hamburgers . " How 's Joe ? " he asked , sitting down . " Oh , fine . How 's Mother ? " " Doing well , sends her love . . . I brought you something , " he said . He set aside his burger to rummage through his windbreakerpockets . Eventually , he came up with a worn white envelope . " Pictures , " he said . " Pictures ? " " Photos . Mother 's got all these photos ; I just discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a few . " Jenny sighed . Poor Ezra : he was turning into the familyp199custodian , tending their mother and guarding their past and faithfully phoning his sister for lunch . " Why do n't you keep them , " she said . " You know I 'd just lose them . " " But a lot of these are of you , " he said . He spilled the envelopeonto the table . " I figured the children might like them . For instance , somewhere here . . . " He shuffled various versions of a younger , sterner Jenny . " Here , " he said . " Do n't you see Becky in this ? " It was Jenny in a plaid tam-o ' - shanter , unsmiling . " Ugh , " she said , stirring her coffee . " You were a really nice little girl , " said Ezra . He returned to his burger but kept the photo before him . On the back of it , Jenny saw , something had been written in pencil . She tried to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 . I got Mother to write the dates down . And I 'm going to send Cody some , too . " Jenny could just imagine Cody 's face when he got them . " Ezra , " she said , " to tell the truth , I would n't waste the postage . " " Do n't you think he 'd like to compare these with how Luke looks , growing up ? " " Believe me , " she said , " he 'd burn them . You know Cody . " " Maybe he 's changed , " Ezra said . " He has n't , " said Jenny , " and I doubt he ever will . Just mentionsomething  --  one little harmless memory from our childhood  --  andhis mouth turns down . You know how his mouth does . I said to him once , I said , Cody , you 're no better than the Lawsons . ' Remember the Lawsons ? They moved into our neighborhoodfrom Nashville , Tennessee , and the very first week all four childlren got mumps . Mrs. Lawson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The next week a pipe in their basement burst and she said , Well , that 's Baltimore . ' Then their daughter broke her wrist . . . When they moved back to Tennessee , I went over to say goodbye . They were loading up their car trunk and they happened to slam the lid down smack on the fingers of their youngest boy . When they drove off he was screaming , and Mrs. Lawson called out , Is n't this a fitting way to leave ? I always did say Baltimore was unlucky . ' "  | " Well , now , I 'm trying to follow you , here , " Ezra said . " It 's whether you add up the list or not , " Jenny said . " I mean , if you catalogue grudges , anything looks bad . And Cody certainlycatalogues ; he 's ruining his life with his catalogues . But after all , I told him , we made it , did n't we ? We did grow up . Why , the three of us turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ezra , his forehead smoothing . " You especially , Jenny . Look at you : a doctor . " " Oh , shoo , I 'm nothing but a baby weigher , " Jenny said . But she was pleased , and when they rose to go she took along the photographs to make him happy . Joe said if they did have a baby , he 'd like it to be a girl . He 'd looked around and noticed they were a little short on girls . " How can you say that ? " Jenny asked . She ticked the girls off on her fingers : " Phoebe , Becky , Jane ... " When her voice trailed away , he stood watching her . She was expecting him to speak , but he did n't . " Well ? " she asked . " That 's only three . " She felt a little rush of confusion . " Have I left one out ? " " No , you have n't left one out . Has she left one out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left one out , she asks . What a question ! No , you have n't left one out . Three is all we have . Three girls . " " Well , there 's no need to act so cross about it . " " I 'm not cross , I 'm frustrated , " he said . " I 'm trying to have a conversation here . " " Is n't that what we 're doing ? " " Yes , yes ... " " Then where 's the problem ? " He would n't say . He stood in the kitchen doorway with his arms folded tight across his chest . He gazed off to one side , scowling . Jenny was puzzled . Were they quarreling , or what ? When the silence stretched on , she gradually , imperceptibly returned to slicing the cucumbers for supper . She brought thep201knife down as quietly as possible , and without a sound scooped the disks of cucumber into a bowl . ( When she and Joe had first met , he 'd said , " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she 'd asked , astonished . " You look so cool , " he told her , " I thought of this bottle of cucumber milk my aunt used to keep on her vanity table . " ) Two of the children , Jacob and Peter , were playing with the Ouija board in front of the refrigerator . Jenny had to step over them when she went to get the tomatoes . " Excuse me , " she told them . " You 're in my way . " But they ignored her ; they were intent on the board . " What will I be when I grow up ? " Jacob asked , and he set his fingertips delicately upon the pointer . " Upper middle class , middle middle class , or lower middle class : which ? " Jenny laughed , and Joe glared at her and wheeled and stamped out of the kitchen . On the evening news , a helicopter crewman who 'd been killed in Laos was buried with full military honors . An American flag , folded into a cushiony triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square-chinned gentleman and his fragile wife . The wife wore a trim beige raincoat and little white gloves . It was she who accepted the flag . The husband had turned away and was weeping , would not even say a few words to the microphonesomebody offered him . " Sir ? Sir ? " a reporter asked . One white glove reached out and took the microphone . " What my husband means to say , I believe , " the wife declared in a feathery , Southern voice , " is we thank all those who 've gathered here , and we know we 're just going to be fine . We 're strong , and we 're going to be fine . " " Hogwash , " Slevin said . " Why , Slevin , " said Jenny . " I did n't know you were politi-cal . " " I 'm not ; it 's just a bunch of hogwash , " he told her . " She ought to say , Take your old flag ! I object ! I give up ! ' "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorting Ezra 's photos ; she held one out to distract him . " Look , " she said . " Your Uncle Cody , at age fifteen . " " He 's not my uncle . " " Of course he is . " " He 's not my real uncle . " " You would n't say that if you knew him . You 'd like him , " Jenny said . " I wish he 'd come for a visit . He 's so . . . unbrotherlyor something ; I do n't know . And look ! " she said , alighting on another photo . " Is n't my mother pretty ? " " I think she looks like a lizard , " Slevin said . " Oh , but when she was a girl , I mean . . . is n't it sad how carefree she was . " " Half the time , she forgets my name , " Slevin said . " Well , she 's old , " Jenny told him . " Not that old . What she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old biddy . Sits at the head of the table with a piece of bread on her plate and sets both hands down flat and just stares around at us , stares around , face like one of those rotating fans , waiting for the butter but never asking , never saying a word . Till finally you or Dad says , Mother ? Could we pass you the butter ? ' and she says , Why , thank you , ' like she was wonderingwhen you 'd realize . " " She has n't had an easy life , " Jenny said . " I wish just once we 'd get all through the meal and nobody offer her the butter . " " She raised us on her own , you know , " Jenny told him . " Do n't you think it must have been hard ? My father walked out and left her when I was nine years old . " " He did ? " Slevin asked . He stared at her . " He left her , absolutely . We never set eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , well , " said Jenny . She leafed through some more photos . " Jesus ! These people ! They try to do you in . " " You 're overreacting , " Jenny told him . " I ca n't even remember the man , if you want to know the truth . Would n't knowp203him if I saw him . And my mother managed fine . It all worked out . Look at this , Slevin : see Ezra 's old-fashioned haircut ? " Slevin shrugged and switched the TV channel . " And see what I was like at your age ? " She handed him the picture with the tam-o ' - shanter . He glanced over . He frowned . He said , " Who did you say that was ? " " Me . " " No , it 's not . " " Yes , it is . Me at thirteen . Mother wrote the date on the back . " " It 's not ! " he said . His voice was unusually high ; he sounded like a much younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why , it 's like a . . . concentration camp person , a victim , Anne Frank ! It 's terrible ! It 's so sad ! " Surprised , she turned the photo around and looked again . True , the picture was n't particularly happy  --  it showed a dark little girl with a thin , watchful face  --  but it was n't as bad as all that . " So what ? " she asked , and she held it out to him once more . He drew back sharply . " It 's somebody else , " he told her . " Not you ; you 're always laughing and having fun . It 's not you . " " Oh , fine , it 's not me , then , " she said , and she returned to the rest of the photos . " I want to talk to you about that oldest boy , " her mother said on the phone . " What 's his name ? Kevin ? " " Slevin , Mother . Honestly . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " Sunday afternoon , when you all came to visit , he slipped into my pantry and made off with my Hoover upright . " Jenny sat down on her bed . She said , " Let me get this straight . " " It 's been missing all week , " her mother said , " and I couldn'tp204understand it . I knew we had n't been burglarized , and even if we had , what would anyone want with my old Hoover ? " " But why accuse Slevin ? " " My neighbor told me , just this afternoon . Mrs. Arthur . Said , Was that your grandson I saw Sunday ? Kind of hefty boy ? Loading your Hoover upright into your daughter 's car trunk ? ' " " That 's impossible , " Jenny said . " Now , how do you know that ? How do you know what is or children the way other people get weekend guests . " " You 're exaggerating , " Jenny told her . " Well , all I ask is for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What , this minute ? " " There 's lint specks all over my carpet . " " Oh , all right , " Jenny said . She laid the receiver on her pillow and climbed from the second floor to the third . Slevin 's door was open and he was n't in his room , although his radio rocked with the Jefferson Airplane . She stepped stealthily over Slevin 's knapsack , avoided a teetering pile of Popular Science magazines , opened his closet door , and found herself staring at her mother 's vacuum cleaner . She would know it anywhere : an elderly machine with a gray cloth dust bag . Its cord was coiled neatly and it seemed unharmed . If he 'd taken it apart to learn how it worked , she might have understood . Or if he 'd smashed it , out of some rage toward her mother . But there it sat , entire . She stood puzzling over it for several seconds . Then she wheeled it out of the closet and lugged it down the stairs , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver . " Jenny ? Jenny ? " " Well , you 're right , " Jenny said . " I found it in his room . " There was a pause in which Pearl could have said , " I told you so , " but kindly did not . Then she said , " I wonder if he might be calling for help in some way . " " By stealing a vacuum cleaner ? "  | " He 's really a very sweet boy , " Pearl said . " I can see that . Maybe he 's asking for a psychologist or some such . " " More likely he 's asking for a neater house , " Jenny said . " The dust balls on his closet floor have started raising a family . " She pictured Slevin , in desperation , stealing an arsenal of cleaning supplies  --  this neighbor 's broom , that neighbor 's Ajax , gathered with the same feverish zeal he showed in collecting Indian head pennies . She was attacked by a sudden sputter of laughter . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to see everything as a joke ? " " It 's not any fault if funny things happen , " Jenny said . " It most certainly is , " said her mother , but instead of explainingherself , she all at once grew brisk and requested the return of her vacuum cleaner by tomorrow morning . Jenny and Joe and every child except the baby were watching television . It was long past bedtime for most of them , but this was a special occasion : the Late , Late Show was A Taste of Honey . Everyone in the house had heard of A Taste of Honey . It was Jenny 's all-time favorite movie . She had seen it once , back in 1963 , and never forgotten it . Nothing else had ever measured up to it , she was fond of saying , and after returning from some other movie she was sure to announce , " Well , it was all right , I guess , but it was n't A Taste of Honey . " By now , any one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . They 'd ask as soon as she walked in the door , " Was it A Taste of Honey , Jenny ? Was it ? " and Phoebe was once heard telling Peter , " I like the new teacher okay , I guess , but she is n't A Taste of Honey . " When they learned it was coming to television , they had all begged to stay up and watch . The older ones made cocoa and the younger ones set out potato chips . Becky and Slevin arranged a ring of chairs around the TV set in the living room . " You know what 's going to happen , " Joe told Jenny . " Afterp206all this time , even A Taste of Honey wo n't be A Taste of Honey . " In a way , he was right . Not that she did n't still love it  --  yes , yes , she assured the children , it was just as she 'd remembered  --  but after all , she was a different person watching it . The movie wrenched her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel hopeful . And was n't it odd , was n't it downright queer , that she 'd never identified the story with her own ? In 1963 , she was a resident in pediatrics , struggling to care for a two-year-old born six weeks after her marriage dissolved . Yet she 'd watched a movie about an unwed , unsupported pregnant girl with the most detached enjoyment , dreamily making her way through a box of pretzels . ( And what had she been doing in a movie theater , anyway ? How had she found the time , during such a frantic schedule ? ) When it was over , she switched off the TV and shooed the children up the stairs . Quinn , the youngest , who had not been all that impressed with A Taste of Honey , was sound asleep and had to be carried by Joe . Even the older ones were groggy and blinking . " Wake up , " she told them . " Come on , now , " and she tugged at Jacob , who had dropped in a bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to their beds and kissed them good night . How noisy their rooms seemed , even in silence !  --  that riotous clamor of toys and flung-off clothes , their vibrant , clashing rock star posters and antiwar bumper stickers and Orioles banners . Three of the children would n't use sheets but slept in sleeping bags instead  --  garishly patterned , zippered cocoons sprawled on top of the blankets ; and Phoebe did n't like beds at all but curled in a quilt on the floor , most often out in the hall in front of her parents ' room . She lay across the doorwaylike a bodyguard , and you had to watch your step in the dark so as not to trip on her . " I want that radio down , " Jenny said , and she kissed the top of Becky 's head . Then she peeked into Slevin 's room , knocked on the frame of his open door , and entered . He wore his daytimeclothes to bed , as always  --  even his wide tooled belt with the trucker 's buckle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hadp207been kissing him good night every night since she 'd married Joe , but still he acted bashful . All she really did was brush her cheek against his , allowing him his dignity . " Sleep well , " she told him . He said , " I see you found the vacuum cleaner . " " Vacuum cleaner , " she said , stalling for time . " I 'm sorry I took it , " he said . " I guess your mom is pretty mad , huh ? But it was n't stealing ; honest . I just needed to borrow it for a spell . " She sat on the edge of the bed . " Needed to borrow it for what ? " she asked . He said , " Well , for . . . I do n't know . Just for . . . See , there it was in the pantry . It was exactly like my mother 's . Just exactly . You know how you never think about a thing , or realize you remember it , and then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot how it had that rubber strip around the edge so it would n't scuff the furniture , and that tall , puffy bag I used to be scared of when I was a kid . It even smelled the same . It had that same clothy smell , just like my mother 's . You know ? So I wanted to take it home . But once I got it here , well , it did n't work out . It 's like I had lost the connection . It was n't the same after all . " " That 's all right , Slevin , " she said . " Heavens , honey , that 's all right . " Then she worried her voice had shown too much , would make him bashful again , so she laughed a little and said , " Shall we get you a Hoover of your own for your birthday ? " He turned over on his side . " Or we could have it made up in calico , " she told him , giggling . " A tiny stuffed calico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Slevin just closed his eyes , so after a while she wished him good night and left . She dreamed she was back with Sam Wiley , her second husband and the one she 'd loved the best . She 'd made a fool of herself over Sam . She dreamed he was twirling on that high woodenp208stool they used to have in their kitchen in Paulham . He was preening the scrolls of his handlebar mustache and singing " Let It Be . " Which had n't even existed , at the time . She opened her eyes and heard " Let It Be " on one of the children 's radios , sailing out across the dark hall . How often had she told them ? She got up and made her way to Peter 's room  --  barefoot , stepping over Phoebe . Radios late at night sounded so different , she thought  --  so far away and crackling with static , almost gritty , as if the music had had to travel above miles of railroad tracks and deserted superhighways , past coal yards and auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She switched off the radio and pulled Peter 's sleeping bag up around his shoulders . She checked on the baby in her crib . Then she returned to bed , shivering slightly , and huddled against Joe 's hulking back for warmth . " Mack the Knife , " Sam used to sing , and " Greenfields "  --  yes , that had been around . She remembered how operatic he 'd get , rolling his eyes , pounding his chest , trying to make her laugh . ( She 'd been an earnest young medical student , in those days . ) Then she remembered the tender , aching line that the examining table had pressed across the mound of the baby , when Jenny was an intern bending over a patient . Six months pregnant , seven months ... By her eighth month the marriage was finished , and Jenny was walking around in a daze . She saw that she had always been doomed to fail , had been unlovable , had lacked some singular quality that would keep a husband . She had never known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eerily familiar  --  like a suspicion , long held , at last confirmed . She wore uniforms designed for male physicians with fortyinchwaists ; there were no maternity lab coats . On rounds , professorswould give her doubtful glances and ask if she were sure she was up to this . Sympathetic nurses brought her so many cups of coffee that she thought she would float away . One of those nurses stayed with her through most of her labor . Other women had their husbands , but Jenny had Rosa Perez , who let her squeeze her fingers as hard as needed and never said a word of complaint.  |p209And  what was the name of that neighbor who used to watch the baby ? Mary something  --  Mary Lee , Mary Lou  --  some fellowintern 's wife , as poor as Jenny and the mother of two children under two . She baby-sat for a pittance , but even that was more than Jenny could afford . And the schedule ! Months of nights on duty , thirty-six hours on call and twelve off , emergency room , obstetrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better . Meanwhile , Becky changed from an infant to a little girl , an outsider really , a lively child with Sam Wiley 's snapping black eyes , unrelated to Jenny . Though it was a shock , sometimes , to see her give that level , considering stare so typical of the Tulls . Was it possible , after all , that this small stranger might constitute a family ? She learned to walk ; she learned to talk . " No ! " she would say , in her firm , spunky voice ; and Jenny , trying to stay awake at three in the morning or three in the afternoon , whatever bit of time they had together , dropped her head in her hands . " No ! " said Becky , and Jenny hauled off and slapped her hard across the mouth , then shook her till her head lolled , then flung her aside and ran out of the apartment to . . . where ? ( A movie , perhaps ? ) In those days , objects wobbled and grew extra edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' white pillows could mesmerize her . Sounds were thick , as if underwater . Words on a chart were meaningless  --  so many k 's and g 's , such a choppy language English was , short syllables , clumps of consonants , she 'd never noticed ; like Icelandic , maybe , or Eskimo . She slammed Becky 's face into her Peter Rabbit dinner plate and gave her a bloody nose . She yanked a handful of her hair . All of her childhood returned to her : her mother 's blows and slaps and curses , her mother 's pointed fingernails digging into Jenny 's arm , her mother shrieking , " Guttersnipe ! Ugly little rodent ! " and some scrap of memory  --  she could n't quite place it  --  Cody catching hold of Pearl 's wrist and fending her off while Jenny shrank against the wall . Was this what it came to  --  that you never could escape ? That certain things were doomed to continue , generation after generation ? She failed to see a curb and sprained her ankle , hobbledp210to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia . She let a greenstick fracture slip right past her . She brought Becky a drink of water in the middle of the night and then suddenly , without the slightest intention , screamed , " Take it ! Take it ! " and threw the cup into Becky 's face . Becky shivered and caught her breath for hours afterward , even in her sleep , though Jenny held her tightly on her lap . Then her mother called from Baltimore and said , " Jenny ? Do n't you write your family any more ? " " Well , I 've been so busy , " Jenny meant to say . Or : " Leave me alone , I remember all about you . It 's all come back . Write ? Why should I write ? You 've damaged me ; you 've injured me . Why would I want to write ? " Instead , she started . . . not crying , exactly , but something worse . She was torn by dry , ragged sobs ; she ran out of air ; there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calmly , " Jenny , hang up . You know that couch in your living room ? Go lie down on it . I 'll be there just as soon as Ezra can drive me . " Pearl stayed two weeks , using all of her vacation time . The first thing she did was call Jenny 's hospital and arrange for sick leave . Then she set about putting the world in order again . She smoothed clean sheets on Jenny 's bed , brought her tea and bracing broths , shampooed her hair , placed flowers on her bureau . Becky , who had hardly seen her grandmother till now , fell in love with her . Pearl called Becky " Rebecca " and treated her formally , respectfully , as if she were not quite sure how much she was allowed . Every morning she walked Becky to the playground and swung her on the swings . In the afternoon they went shopping together . She bought Becky an old-fashioned dress that made her look solemn and reasonable . She bought picture books  --  nursery rhymes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about The Little House . Why , she had loved that book ! She 'd requested it every evening , she remembered now . She 'd sat on that homely old sofa and listened while her mother , with endless patience , read it three times , four times , five . . . Now Becky said , " Read it again , " andp211Pearl returned to page one , and Jenny listened just as closely as Becky did . Sundays , when his restaurant closed , Ezra drove up from Baltimore . He was not , in spite of his innocent face , an open sort of person , and rather than speak outright of Jenny 's new breakability he kept smiling serenely at some point just beyond her . She took comfort from this . There was already too much openness in the world , she felt  --  everyone raging and weeping and rejoicing . She imagined that Ezra was not subject to the ups and downs that jolted other people . She liked to have him read the papers to her ( trouble in Honduras , trouble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) while she listened from a nest of deep blue blankets and a nightgown still warm from her mother 's iron . On the second weekend , Cody blew in from wherever he 'd vanished to most recently . He traveled on a breeze of energy and money ; Jenny was impressed . He used her telephone for two hours like the wheeler-dealer he always was and arranged to pay for a full-time sitter , a slim young woman named Delilah Greening who turned out to be better help than Jenny would ever have again . Then he slung his suit coat over one shoulder , gave her a little salute , and was gone . She slept , sometimes , for twelve and fourteen hours straight . She woke dislocated , frightened by the sunlit , tickling silence of the apartment . She mixed up dreams and real life . " How did it happen  --  ? " she might ask her mother , before she remembered that it had n't happened ( the Shriners ' parade through her bedroom , the elderly gentleman hanging by his heels from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , voices came vividly out of the dark . " Dr. Tull . Dr. Tull , " they 'd say , urgently , officially . Or , " Six hundred fifty milligrams of quinine sulfate . . . " Her own pulse thudded in her eardrums . She held her hand toward the light from the streetlamp and marveled at how white and bloodless she had become . When her mother left and Delilah arrived , Jenny got up and returned to work . For a while , she carried herself as gently as a cup of liquid . She kept level and steady , careful not to spillp212over . But she was fine , she saw ; she really was fine . Weekends , her mother and Ezra paid brief visits , or Jenny took Becky down to Baltimore on the train . They both dressed up for these trips and sat very still so as not to muss their clothes . Jenny felt purified , like someone who had been drained by a dangerous fever . And the following summer , when she could have accepted more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She joined two older pediatricians , entered Becky in nursery school , and shortly thereafter purchased her Bolton Hill row house . She continued to feel fragile , though . She went on guarding a trembly , fluid center . Sometimes , loud noises made her heart race  --  her mother speaking her name without warning , or the telephone jangling late at night . Then she would take herself in hand . She would remind herself to draw back , to loosen hold . It seemed to her that the people she admired ( one of her partners , who was a wry , funny man named Dan Charles ; and her brother Ezra ; and her neighbor Leah Hume ) had this in common : they gazed at the world from a distance . There was something sheeted about them  --  some obliqueness that made them difficult to grasp . Dan , for instance , kept up such a steady , easy banter that you never could ask him about his wife , who was forever in and out of mental institutions . And Leah : she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many pratfalls . How untouched she looked , and how untouchable , chuckling to herself and covering her mouth with a shapely , badly kept hand ! Jenny studied her ; you could almost say she took notes . She was learning how to make it through life on a slant . She was trying to lose her intensity . " You 've changed , " her mother said ( all intensity herself ) . " You 've grown so different , Jenny . I ca n't quite put my finger on what 's wrong , but something is . " She wanted Jenny to remarry ; she hoped for a dozen grandchildren , at least ; she was always after Jenny to get out and mingle , socialize , make herself more attractive , meet some nice young man . What Jenny did n't tell her was , she simply could n't be bothered with all that . She felt textureless , so that events just slid right off her with nop213friction whatsoever ; and the thought of the heartfelt conversationsrequired by a courtship filled her with impatience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his padding , his moat , his barricade of children , all in urgent need of her brisk and competent attention . No conversation there  --  she and Joe had hardly found a moment to speak to each other seriously . They were always trying to be heard above the sound of toy trucks and xylophones . She did n't even have time for thinking any more . " Of course , the material object is nothing , " said the priest . He winced at a squeal from the waiting room . " That 's unimportant , the least of my concerns . Though it did have some historical value . It was donated , I believe , by the missionary brother of one of our parishioners . " Jenny leaned back against the receptionist 's window and touched a hand to her forehead . " Well , I do n't . . . " she said . " What did you say this was ? " " A rhinoceros foot , " said the priest , " in the shape of an umbrellastand . Or an umbrella stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual rhinoceros foot from . . . wherever rhinoceri come from . " A naked toddler shot out a door like a stray piece of popcorn , pursued by a nurse with a hypodermic needle . The priest stood back to give them room . " We know it was there in the morning , " he said . " But at four o'clock , it was gone . And Slevin was in just previously ; I 'd asked him to come for a chat . Only I was on the phone when he arrived . By the time I 'd hung up he was gone , and so was the rhinoceros foot . " Jenny said , " I wonder if his mother had a rhinoceros foot . " " Pardon ? " said the priest . She realized how this must have sounded , and she laughed . " No , " she said , " I do n't mean she had rhinoceros feet . . . oh , Lord ... " The priest said , " Dr. Tull , do n't you see this is serious ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that ? Do n't youp214think something ought to be done ? Where do you stand , Dr. Tull ? " Jenny 's smile faded and she looked into his face . " I do n't know , " she said , after a pause . She felt suddenly bereft , as if something were missing , as if she 'd given something up . She had n't always been like this ! she wanted to tell him . But aloud she said , " I only meant , you see . . . T believe he steals what reminds him of his mother . Hoovers and umbrella stands . Does n't that make sense ? " " Ah , " said the priest . " What 's next , I wonder , " Jenny said . She mused for a moment . " Picture it ! Grand pianos . Kitchen sinks . Why , we 'll have his mother 's whole household , " she said , " her photo albums and her grade-school yearbooks , her college roommate asleep on our bed and her high school boyfriends in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys from the fifties , their hair slicked down wetly , their shirts ironed crisply , perched on her couch like mannequins with heart-shaped boxes of chocolates on their knees . She laughed . The priest groaned . A little blue plastic helicopter buzzed across the waiting room and landed in Jenny 's hair.  |p215The  summer before Luke Tull turned fourteen , his father had a serious accident at the factory he was inspecting . A girder swung around on its cable , hit Luke 's father and the foreman standing next to him , and swept them both off the walkway and down to the lower level of the factory . The foreman was killed . Cody lived , by some miracle , but he was badly hurt . For two days he lay in a coma . There was a question of brain damage , till he woke and , in his normal , crusty way , asked who the hell was in charge around here . Three weeks later , he came home by ambulance . His thick black hair had been shaved off one side of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wounds . His face  --  ordinarily lean and tanned  --  was swollen across one cheekbone and turning different shades of yellow from slowly fading bruises . His ribs were taped and an arm and a leg were in casts  --  the right arm and the left leg , so he could n't use crutches . He was forced to lie in bed , cursing the game shows on TV . " Fools . Jackasses . Who do they think would be watching this crap ? " Luke 's mother , who had always been so spirited , lost something important to the accident . First , in the terrible coma days , she drifted around in a wash of tears  --  a small , wan , pink-eyed woman . Her red hair seemed drained of color . Luke would say ,  | " Mom ? " and she would n't hear , would sometimes snatch up her car keys as if mistaking who had called and go tearing off to the hospital again , leaving Luke alone . Even after the coma ended , it did n't seem she came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his bed for hours saying nothing , lightly stroking one thick vein that ran down the inside of his wrist . She watched the game shows with a tremulous smile . " Jesus , look at them squawk , " Cody said disgustedly , and Ruth bent down and laid her cheek against his hand as if he 'd uttered something wonderful . Luke , who had once been the center of her world , now hung around the fringes . It was July and he had nothing to do . They 'd only been living here  --  in a suburb of Petersburg , Virginia  --  since the end of the school year , and he did n't know any boys his own age . The children on his block were all younger , thin voiced and excitable . It annoyed him to hear their shrieking games of roll-a-bat and the sputtery ksh ! kshew ! of their imaginaryrifles . Toddlers were packed into flowered vinyl wading pools which they spent their mornings emptying , measuring cup by measuring cup , till every yard was a sea of mud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the icy , white and gold elegance of the rented colonial-style house , he surfaced in various gilt-framed mirrors : someone awkward and unwanted , lurching on legs grown too long to manage , his face past cuteness but not yet solidified into anythingbetter  --  an oval , fragile face , a sweep of streaky blond hair , a mouthful of braces that made his lips appear irregular and vulnerable . His jeans were getting too short but he had no idea how to go about buying new ones . He was accustomed to relying on his mother for such things . In the old days , his mother had done everything for him . She had got on his nerves , as a matter of fact . Now he made his own breakfast  --  Cheerios or shredded wheat  --  and a sandwich for lunch . His mother cooked supper , but it was something slapped together , not her usual style at all ; and mostly she would let Luke eat alone in the kitchen while she and Cody shared a tray in the bedroom . Or if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never asked Luke about himself , no ; it was " your daddy " this and " your daddy " that , never a thing but " your daddy . " How well he was bearing up , how he 'd always borne up , always been so dependable from the earliest time she had known him . " I was not but nineteen when I met him , " she said , " and he was thirty years old . I was a homely chit of a girl and he was the handsomest thing you ever saw , so fine mannered and wearing this perfect gray suit . At the time , I was all set to marry Ezra , your daddy 's brother . I bet you did n't know that , did you ? Oh , I got around , in those days ! Then your daddy stepped in . He was brazen as you please . Did n't care how it looked , did n't have an ounce of shame , just moved right in and claimed me for his own . Well , first I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any girl he liked , somebody beautiful even . Then I saw he meant it . I did n't know which way to turn , for I did love your Uncle Ezra , though he was not so . . . I mean , Ezra was a much plainer person , more like me , you would say . But your daddy 'd walk into the room and it seemed like , I do n't know , the air just came alive , somehow . He put his hands on my shoulders one day and I told him please , I was engaged to marry Ezra , and he said he knew that . He stepped up close and I said really , Ezra was a good , good man , and he said yes , he was ; and we hugged each other like two people sharing some bereavement and I said , Why , you 're near about my brother-in-law ! ' and he said , Very nearly , yes , ' and he kissed me on the lips . " Luke lowered his lashes . He wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we 've had our ups and downs , " she said , " well , I just want you to know that it was n't his fault , Luke . Look at me ! I 'm nothing but a little backwoods Garrett County farm girl , hardly educated . And I 'm not so easy to get along with , either . I 'm not so easygoing . You must n't blame him . Why , once  --  oh , you were in nursery school , I bet you do n't rememberthis  --  I packed you up and left him . I told him he did n't love me and never had , only married me to spite his brother , Ezra , that he 'd always been so jealous of . I accused him of terriblep218things , just terrible , and then while he was at work I carried you off to the railroad station and . . . this is funny now when I tell it , but it was n't then : while we were waiting on the bench a Marine threw up in my pocketbook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make myself put my fingers in and get out the tickets , assuming they were still usable ; and could n't bear to reach in for the money to buy more tickets , either . So I called your daddy on the telephone , begged a dime from a nun and said , Cody , come and get me ; this is n't really what I want to be doing . Oh , Cody , ' I said , we 've got so interwoven ; even if you did n't love me at all , now we 're so entwined . It 's you I have to stay with . ' And he left off work and drove down to collect me , all steady and sure in his fine gray suit , nothing like the rest of the world . Do n't you remember that ? You 've forgotten all about it , " she said . " It 's just as well , I reckon . Luke , when you almost lose a person , everything comes so clear ! You see how much he matters , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's irreplaceable . How he always puts us first ; I mean , has never , in all his days , left you and me behind when he 's off on business , but carts us to every new town he 's called to because he wo n't do like his father , he says : travel about forgettinghis own relations . It 's not true that he brings us along because he does n't trust me . He really cares for our welfare . When I think now , " she said , " about your daddy kissing me that first time  --  ' Very nearly , yes , ' he said . Yes , very nearly your brother-in-law , ' and kissed me so quiet but definite , insisting , like he would n't take no for an answer  --  why , I see now that 's when my life began ! But at the time I had no notion , did n't grasp the importance . I did n't know back then that one person can have such effect on another . " But if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone transparent , he imagined ) , Cody was absolutely the same . After all , Cody had n't suffered the strain of that coma ; he 'd been absent from it . He had n't worried he would die , once he came to , because it would n't occur to him that he was the type to die . He 'd sailed through the whole experience with his usual combination of nonchalance and belligerence ,  |p219and  now he lay thrashing on his bed wondering when he could get up again . " What I mainly am is mad , " he told Luke . " This whole damn business has left me mad as hell . I felt that girder hit , you know that ? I really felt it hit , and it hurt , and all the time I was flying through the air I wanted to hit it back , punch somebody ; and now it seems I 'm still waiting for the chance . When do I get to get even ? And do n't talk to me about lawsuits , compensation . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Mom says would you like some soup , " said Luke , wiping his palms nervously down his thighs . " No , I would n't like soup . What 's she always trying to feed me for ? Listen , Luke . If your grandma calls again today , I want you to tell her I 've gone back to work . " " To work ? " " I ca n't stand to hear her fret on the phone any more . " " But all along , " Luke said , " you 've been telling her you were too sick for company . Yesterday you were too sick and today you 've gone back to work ? What 'll she think ? " " It 's nothing to me what she thinks , " said Cody . He never sounded very fond of Grandma Tull , who had called from Baltimore every day since the accident . Luke enjoyed her , the little he knew of her , but Cody said looks were deceiving . " She puts on a good front , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's like . You do n't know what it was like growing up with her . " Luke felt he did know ( had n't he heard it all a million times ? ) but his father had got started now and would n't be stopped . " Let me give you an example , " he said . " Listen , now . This really happened . " That was the way he always introduced his childhood . " This really happened , " he would say , as if it were unthinkable , beyond belief , but then what followed never seemed so terrible to Luke . " I swear it : your grandma had this friend named Emmaline that she had n't seen in years . Only friend she ever mentioned . And Emmaline lived in . . . I forget . Anyhow , someplace far away . So one Christmas I saved up the money to buy a Greyhound bus ticket to wherever this Emma/line lived . I slaved and borrowed and stole the money , and presented my mother with the ticket on Christmas morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of the others , and I said , You leave tomorrow , stay a week , and I 'll watch over things till you get back . ' And you know what she said ? Listen ; you wo n't believe this . But Cody , honey , ' she said . Day after tomorrow is your brother 's birthday . ' " He looked over at Luke . Luke waited for him to go on . " See , " Cody said , " December twenty-seventh was Ezra 's birthday . " " So ? " Luke asked . " So she would n't leave her precious boy on his birthday ! Not even to visit her oldest , dearest , only friend , that her other boy had given her a ticket for . " " I would n't like for Mom to leave me on my birthday , either , " Luke said . " No , no , you 're missing the point . She would n't leave Ezra , her favorite . Me or my sister , she would surely leave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Did you ever try giving her a ticket on your birthday ? I bet she 'd have said the same thing . " " My birthday is in February , " Cody said . " Nowhere near any occasion for gift giving . Oh , I do n't know why I bother talking to you . You 're an only child , that 's your trouble . You have n't the faintest idea what I 'm trying to get across . " And he turned his pillow over and settled back with a sigh . Luke went out in the yard and threw his baseball against the garage . It thudded and bounced back , shimmering in the sunlight . In the old days , his mother had practiced throwing with him . She had taught him to bat and pitch overhand , too . She was good at sports . He saw glimpses in her , sometimes , of the scatty little tomboy she must once have been . But it had always seemed , when they played ball together , that this was only a preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like crammingfor an exam . Then on weekends Cody came home and pitched the ball to him and said , " Not bad . Not bad at all , " when Luke hit it out of the yard . At these moments Luke wasp221conscious of adding a certain swagger to his walk , a certain swing to his shoulders . He imagined he was growing to be more like his father . Sauntering into the house after practice , he 'd pass Cody 's parked car and ask , " She still getting pretty good mileage ? " He would stand in front of the open refrigerator and swig iced tea directly from the pitcher  --  something his mother detested . Oh , it was time to put his mother behind him now  --  all those years of following her through the house , enmeshed in her routine , dragging his toy broom after her big one or leaning both elbows on her dressing table to watch , entranced , as she dusted powder on her freckled nose . The dailiness of women 's lives ! He knew all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trivia of measuring out the soap flakes , waiting for the plumber . High time to move to his father 's side . But his father lay on his back in the bedroom , cursing steadily . " What the hell is the matter with this TV ? Why bother buying a Sony if there 's no one who will fix it ? " " I 'll find us a repairman today , " Ruth 's new , soft voice floated out . Ruth wore dresses all the time now because Cody said he was tired of her pantsuits . " Everlasting polyester pantsuits , " he said , and it was true she did n't look as stylish as most other women , though Luke was n't so sure that the pantsuits were to blame . Even after she changed to dresses , something seemed to be wrong . They were too big , or too hard-surfaced , or too shiny ; they looked less like clothes than . . . housing , Luke thought . " Is this better ? " she asked his father , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loafers because in Garrett County , she said , they had never learned her to walk in high heels . By then , Cody had recovered from his mood . He said , " Sure , honey . Sure . It 's fine . " He was n't always evil tempered . It was the strain of lying immobile . It was the constant discomfort . He did make an effort . But then , not two hours later : " Ruth , will you explain why I have to live in a place that looks like a candy dish ? Is it necessary to rent a house where everything is white and gold and curlicued ? You think of that as class ? "  |p222It  was the nature of Cody 's job that he worked alone . As soon as he finished streamlining whatever factory had called him in , he moved on . His partner , a man named Sloan , lived in New York City and invented the devices that Cody determined a need for  --  sorting racks , folding aids , single hand tools combiningthe tasks of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cody visits , unless you counted that one edgy call by the owner of the factory where he 'd had his accident . And they did n't know any of the neighbors . They were on their own , just the three of them . They might have been castaways . No wonder Cody acted so irritable . The only time Luke and his mother got out was once a week , when they went for groceries . Backing her white Mercedes from the garage , Ruth sat erect and alert , not looking behind her , already anxious about Cody . " Maybe I should 've made you stay . If he needs to go to the bathroom  --  " " He can good and wait , " Luke said through his teeth . " Why , Luke ! " " Let him pee in the bed . " " Luke Tull ! " Luke stared out the window . " It 's been hard on you , " his mother said . " We 've got to find you some friends . " " I do n't need friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a one , in this town . I feel like I 'm drying up . Sometimes I wonder , " she said , " if this life is really . . . " But she did n't say any more . When they returned , Cody was pleasant and cheerful , as if he 'd made some resolutions in their absence . Or maybe he 'd been refreshed by the solitude . " Talked to Sloan , " he told Ruth . " He called from New York . I said to him , soon as I get this cast off I 'm going to finish up at the factory and clear on out . I ca n't take much more of this place . " " Oh , good , Cody , honey . " " Bring me my briefcase , will you ? I want to jot down some ideas . There 's lots I could be doing in bed . "  | " I picked out some of those pears you like . " " No , no , just my briefcase , and that pen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if my fingers are up to writing yet . " He told Luke , " Work is what I need . I 've been starved for work . It 's made me a little snappish . " Luke scratched his rib cage . He said , " That 's all right . " " You make sure you get a job you enjoy , once you 're grown . You 've got to enjoy what you 're doing . That 's important . " " I know . " " Me , I deal with time , " said Cody . He accepted a ball-point pen from Ruth . " Time is my favorite thing of all . " Luke loved it when his father talked about time . " Time is my obsession : not to waste it , not to lose it . It 's like . . . I do n't know , an object , to me ; something you can almost take hold of . If I could just collect enough of it in one clump , I always think . If I could pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If only Einstein were right and time were a kind of river you could choose to step into at any place along the shore . " He clicked his pen point in and out , frowning into space . " If they had a time machine , I 'd go on it , " he said . " It would n't much matter to me where . Past or future : just out of my time . Just someplace else . " Luke felt a pang . " But then you would n't know me , " he said . " Hmm ? " " Sure he would , " Ruth said briskly . She was opening the latches of Cody 's briefcase . " He 'd take you with him . Only mind , " she told Cody , " if Luke goes too you 've got to bring penicillin , and his hay fever pills , and his fluoride toothpaste , you hear ? " Cody laughed , but he did n't say one way or another about taking Luke along . That was the evening that Cody first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they were playing Monopoly onp224Cody 's bed , the three of them , and Cody was winning as usual and offering Luke a loan to keep going . " Oh , well , no , I guess I 've lost , " said Luke . There was the briefest pause  --  a skipped beat . Cody looked over at Ruth , who was counting her deed cards . " He sounds just like Ezra , " he told her . She frowned at Baltic Avenue . " Did n't you hear what he said ? He said it just like Ezra . " " Really ? " " Ezra would do that , " Cody told Luke . " Your Uncle Ezra . It was no fun beating him at all . He 'd never take a loan and he would n't mortgage the least little thing , not even a railroad or the waterworks . He 'd just cave right in and give up . " " Well , it 's only that . . . you can see that I 've lost , " Luke said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more like you 're Ezra 's child , not mine . " " Cody Tull ! What a thought , " said Ruth . But it was too late . The words hung in the air . Luke felt miserable ; he had all he could do to finish the game . ( He knew his father had never thought much of Ezra . ) And Cody , though he dropped the subject , remained dissatisfied in some way . " Sit up straighter , " he kept telling Luke . " Do n't hunch . Sit straight . God . You look like a rabbit . " As soon as he could , Luke said good night and went off to bed . The following morning , everything was fine again . Cody did some more work on his papers and had another talk with Sloan . Ruth cooked a chicken for a nice cold summer supper . AnytimeLuke wandered by , Cody said something cheerful to him . " Why so long in the face ? " he 'd ask , or , " Feeling bored , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cody did n't usually do that . They all had lunch in the bedroom  --  sandwiches and potato salad , like a picnic . The telephone , buried among the sheets , started ringing halfway through the meal , and Cody said not to answer it . It was bound to be his mother , he said . They keptp225perfectly silent , as if the caller could somehow hear them . After the ringing stopped , though , Ruth said , " That poor , poor woman . " " Poor ! " Cody snorted . " Are n't we awful ? " " You would n't call her poor if you knew her better . " Luke went back to his room and sorted through his old model airplanes . His parents ' voices drifted after him . " Listen , " Cody was telling Ruth . " This really happened . For my mother 's birthday I saved up all my money , fourteen dollars . And Ezra did n't have a penny , see . . . " Luke scrabbled through his wooden footlocker , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had accompanied all their moves since before he could remember . He was huntingthe missing wing of a jet . He did n't find the wing but he did find a leather bag of marbles  --  the kind he used to like , with spritzy bubbles like ginger ale inside them . And a slingshot made from a strip of inner tube . And a tonette  --  a dusty black plastic whistle on which , for Mother 's Day back in first grade , he 'd played " White Coral Bells " along with his classmates . He tried it now : White coral bells , upon a slender stalk . . . It returned to him , note by note . He rose and went to his parents ' room to play it through to the end . Lilies of the valley deck myHis father said , " I ca n't stand it . " Luke lowered the tonette . " Are you doing this on purpose ? " Cody asked . " Are you determined to torment me ? " " Huh ? " " Cody , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunting me , is n't that it ? I ca n't get away from him ! I spend half my life with meek-and-mild Ezra and his blasted wooden whistle ; I make my escape at last , and now look : here we go again . It 's like a conspiracy ! Like some kind of plot where someone decided , long before I was born , I would live out my days surrounded by people who were . . . nicer than I am , just naturally nicer without even having to try , peoplep226that other people preferred ; and everywhere I go there 's something , just that goddamn forgiving smile or some demented folk song floating out a window  --  " " Cody , Luke will be thinking you have lost your senses , " Ruth said . " And you ! " Cody told her . " Look at you ! Ah , Lord , " he said . " Some people fit together forever , do n't they ? And you have n't a hope in heaven of prying them apart . Married or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cody , what are you talking about ? " " Admit it , " Cody said . " Is n't Ezra the real , true father of Luke ? " There was a silence . " You did n't say that . You could n't have , " Ruth told him . " Admit it ! " " You know you do n't seriously believe such a thing . " " Is n't it the truth ? Tell me ! I wo n't get angry , I promise . " Luke went back to his room and closed the door . All that afternoon he lay on his bed , rereading an old horse book from his childhood because he did n't have anything else to do . The story struck him as foolish now , although once he 'd loved it . When his mother called him for supper , he walked very firmly into the kitchen . He was going to refuse , absolutely , to eat in the bedroom with Cody any more . But his mother had already set two places at the kitchen table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating much herself . Luke shoveled in various cold foods and refused to meet her eyes . The fact was that she was stupid . He did n't know when he 'd seen such a weak and stupid woman . After supper he went back to his room and listened to a radio show where people called up a tired-sounding host and offered their opinions . They discussed drunken drivers and battered wives . It grew dark , but Luke did n't turn on the light . His mother tapped hesitantly on his door , paused , and left . Then he must have fallen asleep . When he woke it was darker than ever , and his neck was stiff , and a woman on the radio was saying , " Now , I 'm not denying I signed the papers but that wasp227only his fast talk , only him talking me into it . Just put your John Doe right here , ' he tells me . . . " " I assume you mean John Hancock , " the host said wearily . " Whatever , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , came Cody 's grumble and Ruth 's pale answers . Luke covered his head with his pillow . He tried to recall his Uncle Ezra . It was several years since they 'd met . And even that was such a brief visit , his father taking them away in a huff before they 'd got well settled . Finding Ezra was something like hunting through that footlocker ; he had to burrow past a dozen other memories , and more came trailing up along with what he was after . He smelled the burned toast in his grandma 's kitchen and remembered Ezra 's bedroom , which had once been Ezra 's and Cody 's together , where boyhood treasures ( a football-shaped bookend , a peeling hockey stick ) had sat in their places so long that to Ezra , they were invisible . Anything that caught Luke 's attention , Ezra had seemed surprised to see . " Oh ! Would you like to have that ? " he would ask , and when Luke politely declined , not wanting to seem greedy , Ezra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's still doing here . " His room had been large  --  a sort of dormitoryarrangement , occupying the whole third floor  --  but its stuffy smell of used sheets and twice-worn clothes had made it seem smaller . There was a lock inside the bathroom door downstairs , Luke recalled , that looked exactly like a little silver cashew ; and the bathroom itself was tall and echoing , ancient , cold floored , with a porcelain knob in the tub reading WASTE . He tried to picture his cousins  --  Aunt Jenny 's children  --  but only came up with another room : his cousin Becky 's ruffled bedroom , with its throng of shabby stuffed animals densely encirclingher bed . How could she sleep ? he had wondered . But she told him she had no trouble sleeping at all ; and whenever she went away to spend the night , she said , she took the whole menagerie in a giant canvas suitcase and set it out first thing around the new bed , even before unpacking her pajamas ; and most of her friends did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were different . He was mystified and charmed , and he treated her protectively for the rest of that short visit  --  though she was a year older than he and half a head taller . If Ezra were really his father , Luke thought , then Luke could live in Baltimore where houses were dark and deep and secretive . Relatives would surround him  --  a loving grandma , funny Aunt Jenny , those rafts of cousins . Ezra would let him help out in his restaurant . He would talk about food and how people need to be fed with care ; Luke could hear his ambling way of speaking . Yes , now he had it : the memory homed in . Ezra wore a flannel shirt of soft blue plaid , washed into oblivion . His hair was yellow . . . why ! It was Luke 's kind of yellow , all streaky and layered . And his eyes were Luke 's kind of gray , a full shade lighter than Cody 's , and his skin had that same golden cast that caused it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself believe in some unimaginable moment betweenRuth and Ezra , fourteen years ago . He skipped across it quickly to the time when Ezra would arrive to claim him . " You 're old enough to be told now , son ... " Knitting this scene in the dark , doubling back to correct a false note or racing forward to a good part , Luke forgot himself and took the pillow off his head . Instantly , he heard Cody 's voice behind the wall . " Everything I 've ever wanted , Ezra got it . Anything in life I wanted . Even things I thought I had won , Ezra won in the end . And he did n't even seem to be trying ; that 's the hell of it . " " You won the damn Monopoly games , did n't you ? " Luke shouted . Cody said nothing . The next morning , Cody seemed unusually quiet . Ruth took him into the doctor 's to get his walking cast  --  a moment they 'd been waiting for , but Cody did n't act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a crutch . He flinched when Cody first laid his heavy arm cast across his shoulders ; he felt there wasp229some danger hovering . But Cody was a dead weight , grunting as he walked , evidently thinking about other matters . He heaved himself into the car and stared bleakly ahead of him . In the doctor 's waiting room , while Luke and his mother read magazines , Cody just sat empty faced . And after he got his walking cast , he hobbled back to the car unassisted , ignoring Luke 's offer of help . He fell into bed as soon as they reached home and lay gazing at the ceiling . " Cody , honey ? Remember the doctor said to give that leg some exercise , " Ruth told him . He did n't answer . Luke went out to the yard and kicked at the grass a while as if he were hunting for something . Next door , a cluster of toddlers in their wading pool stared at him . He wanted to shout , " Turn away ! Stop looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was he who turned , wandering out of the yard and down the street . More wading pools ; more round-eyed , judging stares . A Welsh corgi , squat and dignified , bustled down the sidewalk , followed by a lady in a flowing caftan . " Toulouse ! Toulouse ! " she called . The heat was throbbing ; it almost breathed . Luke 's face became filmed with sweat and his T-shirt stuck to his back . He kept wiping his upper lip . He passed rows of colonial houses similar to his , each with some object featured like a museum piece in the living-room window : a bulbous lamp , a china horse , a vase of stiff-necked marigolds . ( And what did his own window have ? He could n't recall . He wanted to say a weeping fig tree , but that was from an apartment they 'd rented , three or four towns back . ) Sprinklers spun lazily . It was a satisfaction to stop , from time to time , and watch a lawn soak up the spangled water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby in a stroller , small children all around her . He crossed the street to avoid them , took a right turn , and arrived on Willow Bough Avenue with its whizzing traffic , discount drugstores , real estate offices and billboards and service stations . He waited at an intersection , pondering where to go next . One of the things about moving so often was , he never really knew where he was . He believedp230his sense of direction had been blunted . He could n't understand how some people seemed to carry a kind of detailed , internal map of the town they lived in . A Trailways bus zipped past him reading BALTIMORE . Imagine hailing it . ( Could you hail a Trailways bus ? ) Imagine boarding it  --  assuming he had the money , which he did n't  --  and riding off to Baltimore , arriving at Ezra 's restaurant and strolling in . " Here I am . " " There you are , " Ezra would say . Oh , if only he 'd brought his money ! Another bus passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck drew up , braking for an amber light . Luke , as if obeying orders , stuck out a thumb . The driver leaned across the seat and opened the door on the passenger side . " Hop on in , " he told Luke . No RIDERS , a label on the window read . None of this was happening . Slowly , like someone being pushed from behind , Luke climbed into the cab . It was filled with loud music and a leathery , sweaty , masculine smell that made him feel instantly comfortable . He slammed the door and settled back . The driver  --  a knife-faced man , unshaven  --  squinted up at the traffic light and asked , " Whereabouts you headed , son ? " Luke said , " Baltimore , Maryland . " " Folks know you 're going ? " " Sure , " said Luke . The driver shot him a glance . " Why , my folks . . . live in Baltimore , " Luke told him . " Oh , then . " The truck started up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother went for groceries . A green sign swung overhead , listing points north . " Well , " said the driver , adjusting his mirror , " I tell you : I can carry you as far as Richmond . That 's where I have to veer west . " " Okay , " said Luke . Even Richmond , after all , was farther than he 'd ever meant to go . On the radio , Billy Swan was singing " I Can Help . " The driver hummed along in a creaky voice that never quite hit the right note . His thin gray hair , Luke saw , had recently beenp231combed ; it lay close to his skull in damp parallel lines . He held a cigarette between his fingers but he did n't light it . His fingernailswere so thick and ridged , they might have been cut from yellow corduroy . " In the summer of fifty-six , " he said , " I was passing along this very road with my wife in a Safeway grocery truck when she commences to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into labor . Lord God ! I recall to this day . She says , Clement , I think it 's my time . ' Well , I was young then . Inexperienced . I thought a baby came one-two-three . I thought we did n't have a moment to spare . And also , you know what they say : a seven-month baby will turn out good but an eightmonthbaby wo n't make it . I ca n't figure why that should be . So anyhow , I put on the brakes . I 'm shaking all over . My brake foot is so shaky we 're just wobbling down the highway . You see that sign over there ? Leading off to the right ? See that hospital sign ? Well , that is where I taken her . Straight up that there road . I never come by here but what I recall it . " Luke looked politely at the hospital sign , and then swiveled his neck to go on looking after they had passed . It was the only response he could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Safeway thought I 'd hijacked their rig . " " Well , " said Luke , " but the baby got born okay . " " Sure , " the driver told him . " Five-pound girl . Lisa Michelle . " He thought a moment . Then he said , " She died later on , though . " Luke cleared his throat . " Crib death is what they call it nowadays , " said the driver . He swerved around a trailer . " Ever hear of it ? " " No , sir , I have n't . " " Sudden crib death . Six months old . Light of my life . Bright as a button , too  --  loved me to bits . I 'd come home and she would just rev right up  --  wheel her arms and legs like a windmillsoon as she set eyes on me . Then she went and died . " " Well , gosh , " said Luke . " Now I got others , " the driver said . " Want to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p232Luke  turned down the visor . A color photo , held in place by a pink plastic clothespin , showed three plain girls in dresses so new and starchy that it must have been Easter Sunday . " The youngest is near about your age , " the driver said . " What are you : thirteen , fourteen ? " He honked at a station wagon that had cut too close in front . " They 're nice girls , " he said , " but I do n't know . It 's not the same , somehow . Seems like I lost the ... attachment . Lost the knack of getting attached . I mean , I like them ; shoot , I love them , but I just do n't have the . . . seems to me I ca n't get up the energy no more . " A lady on the radio was advertising Chevrolets . The driver switched stations and Barbra Streisand came on , showing off as usual . " But you ought to see my wife ! " the driver said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the very first one . She just started in all over . I do n't know what to make of her . I look at her and I ca n't believe it . Dotty , ' I say , really it all comes down to nothing . It 's not for anything , ' I say . Dotty , how come you can go on like this ? ' See , me , I never bounced back so good . I pass that hospital road and you know ? I halfway believe if I made the turnoff , things would be just like before . Dotty 'd be holding my hand , and Lisa Michelle would be waiting to be born . " Luke rubbed his palms on his jeans . The driver said , " Well , now . Listen to me ! Just gabbing along ; I guess you think I talk too much . " And for the rest of the trip he was quiet , only whistling through his teeth when the radio played a familiar song . He said goodbye near Richmond , going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past a rest center . " You wait right here and you 'll get a ride in no time , " he said . " Here they 're traveling slow anyhow , and wo n't mind stopping . " - - raised his hand stiffly and drove off . From a dista ' ce , his truck looked as bright and chunky as a toy . But it seemed he took some purpose with : m , some atmosphereof speed and assurance . All at once . . . what was Luke doing here ? What could he be thinking of . He saw himself , alone in the fierce white glare of the sun , co king his the atp233an amateurish angle on a road in the middle of nowhere . He could n't even visualize how far he had to go . ( He 'd never done well in geography . ) Although it was hot  --  the peak of the afternoon , by now  --  he wished for a windbreaker : protection . He wished for his billfold , not so much for the small amount of money it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it when he bought it . If he were killed on this road , how would they know whom to notify ? He wondered if  --  homeless , parentless  --  he would have to wear these braces on his teeth for the rest of his life . He pictured himself as an old man , still hiding a mouthful of metal whenever he smiled . Then an out-of-date , fin-tailed car stopped next to him and the door swung open . " Need a lift ? " the driver asked . In the back , a little tow-headed boy bounced up and down , calling , " Come on ! Come on ! Get in and have a ride . Come on in and ride with us ! " Luke got in . He found the driver smiling at him  --  a suntannedman in blue jeans , with deep lines around his eyes . " My name 's Dan Smollett , " he said . " That 's Sammy in the back seat . " " I 'm Luke . " " We 're heading toward D.C. That do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Luke . " I guess , " he added , still unsure of his geography . " I 'm on my way to Baltimore . " " Baltimore ! " said Sammy , still bouncing . " Daddy , can we go to Baltimore ? " " We have to go to Washington , Sammy . " " Do n't we know someone in Baltimore too ? Kitty ? Susie ? Betsy ? " " Now , Sammy , settle down , please . " " We 're looking up Daddy 's old girlfriends , " Sammy told Luke . " Oh , " said Luke . " We just came from Raleigh and saw Carla . " " No , no , Carla was in Durham , " his father told him . " It was DeeDee you saw in Raleigh . " " Carla was nice , " said Sammy . " She was the best of the bunch . You would 've liked her , Luke . "  | " I would ? " " It 's too bad she was married . " " Sammy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , that 's all right , " said Luke . He was n't sure what he was hearing , anyhow . They were back on the freeway by now , staying in the slow lane  --  perhaps because of the grinding noise that came whenever Dan accelerated . Luke had never been in a car as old as this one . Its interior was a dusty gray felt , the floors awash in paper cups and Frito bags . The glove compartment  --  doorless  --  spilled out maps that were splitting at the seams , along with loose change , Lifesavers , and miniature tractors and dump trucks . In the rear , Sammy bounced among blankets and grayish pillows . " Settle down , " his father kept saying , but it did n't do any good . " He gets a little restless , along about afternoon , " Dan told Luke . " How long have you been traveling ? " Luke asked . " Oh , three weeks or so . " " Three weeks ! " " We left just after summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to teach this grammar course first . " " Lookit here , " Sammy said , and on his next bounce upward he thrust a wad of paper into Luke 's face . Evidently , someone had been chewing on it . It was four sheets , mangled together , bearing typed columns of names and addresses . " Daddy 's old girlfriends , " Sammy said . Luke stared . " They are not , " said his father . " Really , Sammy . " He told Luke , " That 's my graduating class in high school . Boys and girls . Last year they had a reunion ; I did n't go but they sent us this address list . " " Now we 're looking up the girls , " Sammy said . " Not all the girls , Sammy . " " The girls that you went out with . " " My wife is divorcing me , " Dan told Luke . He seemed to think this explained everything . He faced forward again , and Luke said , " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Texaco and Amoco signs . A moving van honked obliginglyp235when Sammy gave the signal out the window . Sammy squealed and bounced all the harder  --  a spiky mass of bones and striped T-shirt , flapping shorts , torn sneakers . " What year are you in school ? " Dan asked Luke . " I 'm going into ninth grade . " " Read any Hemingway ? Catcher in the Rye ? What are they giving you to read ? " " I do n't know yet . I 'm new , " said Luke . He could easily picture Dan as a teacher . He would wear his jeans in the classroom . He 'd be one of those casual , cornradelytypes that Luke had never quite trusted . Better to have him in suit and tie ; at least then you knew where you stood . " In Washington , " Sammy said , " there 's two girls , Patty and Lena . " " Do n't say girls , say women , " Dan told him . " Patty Sears and Lena Sparrow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan said to Luke . " They were in my homeroom . " " Lena we hear is separated , " Sammy said . Luke said , " But what do you do when you visit ? What is there to do ? " " Oh , sit around , " Sammy said . " Stay a few days if they ask us . Play with their dogs and their cats and their kids . Most of them do have kids . And husbands . " " Well , then , " said Luke . " If they 've got husbands ... " " But we do n't know that till we get there . Do we , " Sammy said . " Sammy 's a little mixed up , " Dan said . " It 's not as though we 're hunting replacements . We 're just traveling . This divorce has come as a shock and I 'm just , oh , traveling back . I 'm visiting old friends . " " But only girl friends , " Sammy pointed out . " They 're girls I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they liked me ; they thought I was fine . Or at least , they seemed to . I assumed they did . I do n't know . Maybe they were just acting polite . Maybe I was a mess all along . " Luke could n't think what to say.  | " So listen ! " Dan told him . " You read The Great Gatsby yet ? " " I do n't think so . " " How about Lord of the Flies ? You get to Lord of the Flies ? " " I have n't read anything , " said Luke . " I 've been moved around a lot ; anyplace I go they 're doing Silas Marner . " This seemed to throw Dan into some kind of depression . His shoulders sagged and he said no more . Sammy finally stopped bouncing and sat back with a Jack and Jill . Pages turned , rattling in the hot wind that blew through the car . On the seat between Dan and Luke , Dan 's address list fluttered . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two columns to a sheet ; it would be used up in no time . Luke said , " Urn ... " Dan looked over at him . " You must have gone to college , " Luke said . " Yes . " " Or even graduate school . " " Just college . " " Do n't you have some addresses from there ? " " College is n't the same , " said Dan . " I would n't be going far enough back . Why , " he said , struck by a thought , " college is where I met my wife ! " " Oh , I see , " Luke said . Outside Washington , Dan stopped the car to let him off . On the horizon was a haze of buildings that Dan said was Alexandria . " Alexandria , Virginia ? " Luke asked . He did n't understand what that had to do with Washington . But Dan , who seemed in a hurry , was already glancing in his side-view mirror . Sammy hung out the window calling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? Will you come and visit when we find a place ? Write me a letter , Luke ! " " Sure , " said Luke , waving . The car rolled off . By now it must be four o'clock , at least , but it did n't seem to Luke that he felt any cooler . His eyes ached from squinting in the sunlight . His hair had grown stringy and stiff . Somethingp237about this road , though  --  the foreign smells of tar and diesel fuel , or the roar of traffic  --  made him believe for the first time that he really was getting somewhere . He was confident he 'd be picked up sooner or later . He thumbed a while , walked a few yards , stopped to thumb again . He had turned to begin another walk when a car slammed on its brakes , veering to the shoulder in front of him . " For God 's sake , " a woman called . " Get in this instant , you hear ? " He opened the door and got in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan 's car but almost as worn-looking , as if it had been used a great deal . The woman inside was plump and fortyish . Her eyes were swollen and tears had streaked her cheeks , but he trusted her anyhow ; you 'd think she was his mother , the way she scolded him . " Are you out of your mind ? Do you want to get killed ? Do you know the kind of perverts in this world ? Make sure your door 's shut . Lock it , dammit ; we 're not in downtownSleepy Hollow . Fasten your seat belt . Hook up your shoulder harness . " He was happy to obey . He adjusted some complicated kind of buckle while the woman , sniffling , ground the gears and shot back into traffic . " What 's your name ? " she asked him . " Luke . " " Well , Luke , are you a total idiot ? Does your mother know you 're hitching rides ? Where are your parents in all of this ? " " Oh , ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't guess you would be going there . " " God , no , what would I want with Baltimore ? " " Well , where are you going ? " " I do n't know , " she told him . " You do n't know ? " He looked at her . The tears were streaming down her cheeks again . " Um , maybe  --  " he said . " Oh , relax . Never mind , I 'll take you on to Baltimore . " You will ? " " It 's better than circling the Beltway forever . " " Golly , thanks , " he said . " They 're letting infants out on their own these days . "  | " I 'm not an infant . " " Do n't you read the papers ? Sex crimes ! Muggings ! Murders ! Things that make no sense . " " So what ? I 've been traveling on my own a long time . Years , " he said . " Ever since I was born , almost . " " For all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be holding you for ransom . " This startled a laugh out of him . She glanced over and gave a sad smile . There was something reassuring about the comfortablemound of her stomach , the denim skirt riding up her stocky legs , the grayish-white tennis shoes . Periodically , she swabbed at the tip of her nose with her knuckles . He noticed that she wore a wedding ring , and had worn it for so long it looked embedded in her finger . " Just two or three miles ahead , not a month ago , " she said , " a boy in a sports car stopped to pick up a girl and she smashed in his skull with a flashlight , rolled him down an embankment , and drove away in his sports car . " " That proves it 's you doing something dangerous , not me , " he pointed out . ( How easy it was to fall into the bantering , argumentative tone reserved for mothers ! ) " What did you pick me up for ? I could be planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , sniffling again . " You would n't happen to have a Kleenex on you , by any chance ? " " No , sorry . " " I 'd never stop for just anyone , " she told him . " Only if they 're in danger  --  I mean young girls alone , or infants like you . " " I am not an  --  " " Yesterday it was a girl in short shorts , can you believe it ? I told her ; I said , Honey , you 're inviting trouble , dressed like that . ' Day before , it was a twelve-year-old boy . He said he 'd been robbed of his bus fare and had to get home as best he could . Day before that  --  " " What , you drive here every day ? " " Most days . " He looked out the window at the vans and oil tankers , inter/state buses , cars with their overloaded luggage racks . " I had sort of thought this was a long-range highway , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I live right nearby , " she told him . " Then what are you driving around for ? " Her chin crumpled in . " None of your business , " she said . " Oh . " " What it is , you see , I generally do this from two or three in the afternoon till suppertime . Sometimes I go to Annapolis , sometimes off in Virginia someplace . Sometimes just round and round the Beltway . It all depends , " she said . She tossed him a look , as if expecting him to ask what it all depended on , but he had been insulted and said nothing . She sighed . " Two or three o'clock is when my daughter wakes up . My daughter is fourteenyears old . Just about your age , right ? How old are you ? " He drummed his fingers and looked out the window . " In the summer , she sleeps forever . My husband says , Jeepers , Mag . ' He says , Why do you let her sleep so late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's because she 's impossible . Truly impossible . I mean , it is n't believable that she could be so awful . She comes downstairs in her bathrobe , yawning . Finds me in the kitchen . Says , Well , Ma , I see you 're wearing your insecticide perfume again . DDT Number Five . ' Then she floats away . Leaving me sniffing my wrists and wondering . I say , Liddie , are you going to clean your room today ? ' and she says , Listen to you , sniping and griping ; you sound exactly like your mother . ' I make a little joke ; she says , Very funny , Ma . Ha ha . The big comedian . ' I find she 's stolen my best lace bra that I only wear on my anniversaryand she flings it back all grimy at the seams : Take it , who wants it , it 's too flat-chested anyhow . ' To my face , she calls me a bitch , says I 'm fat and homely , says she hates me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's time we got a few things straight , ' but all she does is yawn and start chewing one of those plastic price-tag strings off the sleeve of her blouse . I tell my husband , Speak to her , ' so he says , Liddie , you know how your mother gets . Why do you upset her ? ' I say , How I get ? What do you mean , how I get ? ' and before you know , it 's him andp240me fighting , which may have been her plan all along . Division . Disruption . Chaos . That 's what she enjoys . She 's got this boyfriend , treats him terribly . Finally he broke up with her , and she cried all night and asked a hundred times , Why did I act like I did ? What can I do to change his mind ? ' I told her to be honest , just phone him and say she did n't know what had got into her ; so next morning she phoned , and they made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for my good advice . Her life was back in order , it looked like . So she sat at the table a while , calm as I 've seen her . Then she started swinging her foot . Then she started picking her fingernails . Then she went and phoned her boyfriend again . Said , Roger , I did n't want to tell you this but I thought it 's time you knew . The doctor says I 'm dying of leukemia . ' " Luke laughed . She looked over at him innocently , but he noticed a wry , proud twist at the corners of her mouth . " Around two or three o'clock , " she said , " I get in my car and start driving . At first , I 'm talking out loud . You ought to see me . I 'm never coming back , ' I say . I 'm cursing through my teeth ; I 'm honking at crippled old ladies . That little wretch , that pest , that spoiled brat , ' I say . She 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to see my traffic record ! One more point on my license and I 'll have to take that Saturday course on the evils of reckless driving ; have to watch that movie where the lady ends up decapitated . Well , at least it 'll get me out of the house . I sling the car around and do n't let other cars ahead of me and I picture how my husband will come home and say , Liddie ? Where is your mother ? What did you do to her , Liddie ? ' and Liddie will feel just awful . . . but then I think of my husband . I have a really nice husband . It 's not him I want to leave . And I wonder if I could sneak back home at night and tell him , Psst ! Let 's both leave . Let 's elope , ' I 'll say . But I know he would n't do it . He 's not as much involved . She annoys him but he 's not around enough to make any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making mistakes . Overreacting , letting her get to me ... oh , I can think of so many ! You could say that what I'mp241leaving behind is my own poor view of me , right ? So then I start driving slower . I start remembering things . I think of Liddie when she was small : she always stood so straight . You could pick her out of a crowd by her straight little back . And for one whole year she would only eat with chopsticks . Clickclickagainst her plate . . . you ought to have seen the mess ! But I did n't mind . In those days , she liked me a lot . I was a really good mother , and she liked me . " " Maybe she still likes you , " Luke said doubtfully . " No , " said the woman . " She does n't . " They passed a sign for Baltimore . The countryside seemed endlessly the same  --  fields of high grass , then the backsides of housing developments with clotheslines and motorcycles and aboveground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the scenery came around regularly on a giant conveyorbelt . " What it is , " said the woman , " it 's like I 'm driving till I find her past self . You know ? And my past self . Then mile by mile , I simmer down . I let up on the gas a bit more . So by suppertime , I 'm ready to come home again . " Luke checked the clock on her dashboard . It was four thirtyfive . " Tonight I 'll just fix a tuna salad , " she said . " Well , I appreciate your doing this . " " It 's nothing , " she said , and she gave a final swipe to her nose . By five o'clock , they had reached the outskirts of Baltimore . It was something like entering a piece of machinery , Luke thought  --  all sooty and cluttered and churning . The woman seemed used to it ; she drove without comment . " Now , tell me what to do after Russell Street , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find your house ? " " Oh , " he said , " why do n't you just drop me off downtown . " " Where downtown ? " " Anyplace will do . " She looked over at him.  |p242He  said , " I live so near , I mean . . . " " Near to where ? " " Why , to anywhere . " " Now , listen , Luke , " she said . " I 'm getting a very odd feelinghere . I want to know exactly where your parents are . " He wondered what she would do if he told her he had to look them up in the telephone book . He 'd been away so long , he would say , at summer camp or someplace , the address had just slipped his . . . no . But the fact was , he had never known Ezra 's street address . It was just a house they arrived at , Cody driving , Luke sitting in back . " The thing of it is , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Homesick Restaurant . Maybe you could drop me off at the restaurant . " " Where is that ? " " Ah ... " " There is no such place , is there , " she said . " I knew it ! Homesick Restaurant , indeed . " " There is ! Believe me , " he said . " But it 's new . They just did buy it , and I have n't been there yet . " " Look it up , " she told him . She stopped so suddenly , he was glad he 'd fastened his seat belt . A telephone booth stood beside them . " Go on ! Look it up , " she told him . She must have thought she was calling his bluff . Luke said , " All right , I will . " Then in the phone booth  --  the old , fully enclosed kind , a glass and aluminum boxful of heat  --  he ran a finger past Homeland Racquet Club , Homeseekers Realty , and found himself so surprised by Homesick Restaurant that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's on St. Paul Street , " he said when he came back to the car . " You can drop me off anywhere ; I 'll find the number . " But no , she had to take him to the doorstep , though it meant a good deal of doubling back because St. Paul , it turned out , was one-way and she kept miscalculating the cross streets . When she parked in front of the restaurant , she said , " Well , I 'll be ! It exists . " " Thank you for the ride , " Luke said.  |p243She  peered at him . " Are you going to be all right , Luke ? " she asked . " Of course I am . " " And you 're certain your parents are here . " " Of course they are . " But she waited , anyhow . ( It reminded him of the gradeschoolparties given by his classmates  --  his mother making sure he got in before she drove away . ) He tried the restaurant 's door and found it locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman leaned out her window and called , " What 's the trouble , Luke ? " " I forgot , I have to use the kitchen entrance . " " What if that 's locked , too ? " " It is n't . " " You listen , Luke , " she called to him . " Everything is changing ; things are n't safe like in the old days . Every alley in this city is full of muggers , are you hearing what I say ? Every doorway and vacant building , Luke , every street in Baltimore . " He waved and disappeared . A moment later he heard her car take off again  --  but reluctantly , without its usual verve , as if she were still absorbed in her catalogue of dangers . He knew the restaurant so well , he must have carried its image constantly within him : its clatter of pans and crash of china , smell of cut celery simmering in butter , broom-shaped bundles of herbs dangling from the rafters , gallon jars of wrinkly Greek olives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotedly by a boy no older than Luke . Beyond the kitchen , hardly separate from it , stretched the dining room with its white-draped tables and dusty sunbeams . There were so many decorations in the dining room  --  gifts and mementos , accumulatedover the years  --  that Luke was always reminded of someone'shome , one of those teeming family houses where kindergartendrawings are taped above the mantel and then forgotten . He recognized the six-foot collage of Ezra 's hearts-of-palm salad , presented by an artist who often ate here , and he saw thep244colored paper chain that he and his cousins had festooned around a light fixture for some long-ago Christmas dinner . ( Ezra had never taken it down , though the dinner had broken off in a quarrel and the chain was now brittle and faded . ) Luke knew that in one corner , out of his line of vision , sat a heavy antique bicycle that Ezra had bought in a Timonium flea market . MERCURIO 'S CULINARY DELICACIES was lettered importantly across its wooden basket , which was filled with frosty glass pears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a cardboard Marilyn Monroe with her dress blowing up  --  the prank of unknown persons , but no one had ever removed her and Marilyn rode on , her neck creased nearly to the breakingpoint , her smile growing paler season by season and her accordion-pleated skirt curling at the edges . Hot , flushed workers darted around the kitchen , intent on their private tasks , weaving between the others like those Model T 's in silent comedies  --  zip ! , just missing , never once colliding , their paths crisscrossing but miraculously slipping past disaster . Luke stood in the doorway unnoticed . His trip had been such a process in itself ; he had almost lost sight of his purpose . What was he doing here , anyhow ? But then he saw Ezra . Ezra was piling biscuits in a crude rush basket . He wore not the blue plaid shirt that Luke remembered  --  which was flannel , after all , unsuitablefor summer  --  but a chambray shirt with the sleeves rolled up . He thoughtfully set each biscuit in its place , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the kitchen . He was surprised by a flash of shyness . His heart was beating too fast . He arrived in front of Ezra and said , " Hi . " Ezra looked up , still thoughtful . " Hi , " he said . He did n't know who this was . Luke was stricken , at first . Then he began to feel pleased . Why , he must have changed immeasurably ! He 'd shot up a foot ; his voice was getting croaky ; he was practically a man . And there was some safety , a kind of shield , in Ezra 's flat gaze . Luke rearranged his plans . He squared his shoulders . " I 'd like a job , " he said firmly . Ezra grew still . " Luke ? " he said.  | " If that boy over there can tend the kettles  --  " Luke was saying . He stopped . " Pardon ? " " It 's Cody 's Luke . Is n't it . " " How 'd you guess ? " " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like your dad , just exactly like your dad . How funny ! And something about the tone of your voice , all set to do battle . . . well , Luke ! " He shook Luke 's hand very hard . His fingers had a sandy feel from the biscuits . " Where are your parents ? Back at the house ? " " I 'm here on my own . " " On your own ? " Ezra said . He was smiling genially , uncertainly , like someone hoping to understand a joke . " You mean , with nobody else ? " " I wanted to ask if I could stay with you . " Ezra stopped smiling . " It 's Cody , " he said . " Excuse me ? " " Something 's happened to him . " " Nothing 's happened . " " I should have gone down ; I knew I should . I should n't have let him stop me . The accident was worse than they let on . " " No ! He 's fine . " Ezra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's already got his walking cast , " Luke told him . " Yes , but his other wounds , his head ? " " Everything 's okay . " " You swear it ? " " Yes ! Gosh . " " See , I do n't have any other brothers , " Ezra said . " I swear . I cross my heart , " said Luke . " Then where is he ? " " He 's in Virginia , " said Luke . " I left him there . I ran away . " Ezra thought this over . A waitress sidled past him with a tray of delicately clinking , trembling glasses . " I did n't plan to , " Luke told him . " But he said to me . . . see , he said ... " Oh , there was no point in telling Ezra what Cody had said.
