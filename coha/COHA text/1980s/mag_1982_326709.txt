COVER STORY <P> Bishops and the Bomb <P> A theology of peace challenges nuclear strategy <P> In another age the meeting would have been held in seclusion and secrecy . Last week , however , 276 bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in the U.S. were debating in the full glare of TV lights and under the gaze of an international press corps . A few years ago precedent would have dictated that division among the prelates be suppressed , lest the faithful be scandalized . But many of the bishops who assembled for the annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington , D.C. , were openly wondering if their ideas were right for the church , or for the nation . And the document that the bishops debated , instead of being couched in the traditional terms of moral certitude , asked Catholics not to read and obey , but to weigh and consider the conclusions , much as had the bishops themselves . Both the candid , probing manner of the debate and the topic of their discussion reflect the enormous changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The document under discussion was the draft of a pastoral letter , addressed to 51 million American Catholics , on the morality of nuclear war . In it , the bishops are seeking to develop a theology of peace that challenges some of the fundamental assumptions and defense strategies of every American Administration , and most of the Western world , since the beginning of the nuclear age . The bishops ' key attack is on the doctrine of nuclear deterrence . They acknowledge that the U.S. threat to use nuclear arms in response to a Soviet assault might prevent the outbreak of war , but they nonetheless conclude that the policy is unsatisfactory because it created , and keeps in place , a balance of terror that all too easily could lead to a holocaust . They are also offended by the cost of maintaining deterrence , which they say takes money away from programs for the poor . In addition , the bishops call for a nuclear freeze , which is opposed by the Administration and many experts , who argue that it would preserve Soviet nuclear superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a disarmament agreement with Moscow . <P> Doubting that any nuclear war can be limited , the bishops oppose the first use of nuclear weapons by the U.S. To deter the Soviets from using their superior conventional forces in an invasion of Western Europe , the U.S. has kept open the option of using nuclear weapons before the Soviets do . The bishops also criticize the deployment of new MX missiles on the ground that they would quicken the arms race . The Administration insists that the U.S. needs the MX to counter new Soviet weaponry . Surveying the broad sweep of the bishops ' document , Archbishop Edward A. McCarthy , 64 , of Miami said last week , " Cataclysmic threats demand dramatic responses . We need to demonstrate that waging peace has become a high priority of the church of the Prince of Peace in this 20th century crisis . " <P> With the endorsement of Pope John Paul II , a Vatican panel declared in September that prevention of nuclear war " is the greatest moral issue humanity has ever faced and there is no time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian theological teachings about war be applied to the realities of the current arms race ? For two years the U.S. bishops have struggled with that
