In the " Streetwise " world , the mother of Tiny , an impish-looking 14-year-old prostitute , can , without irony , describe the way her daughter earns her allowance as " just a phase she ' s going through . " Tiny ' s boyfriend , a skinny kid called Rat , rummages through dumpsters for dinner . His best friend , DeWayne , periodically breaks up the monotony of the daily hustle with visits to his imprisoned father , a con man and arsonist . Their teen-age cronies are a collection of pimps , prostitutes , drug dealers and panhandlers . " Streetwise " may sound like a modern variation on " Oliver Twist . " Indeed , Dickens would have been hard pressed to come up with a more colorful cast of artful dodgers . But this touching documentary about street kids in Seattle is stuck with the fact that real life dishes out happy endings only sparingly . Instead , there are a sister dead of cirrhosis by age 26 , a 35-year-old mother shriveled to a dry brittle shell by too much booze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his competitor beats up the girls who work for him . An adolescent prostitute shrugs and says : " Who cares ? Whatever happens , happens . " Yet " Streetwise " isn ' t simply a dose of documented misery . The film makers have caught on to the romance of kids roaming free of school and adults without romanticizing the children ' s lives . The kids crack jokes as they discuss venereal disease with doctors , johns with fellow prostitutes . The film is an expansion of a 1983 Life magazine article on runaway children , which was put together by staff writer Cheryl McCall and photographer Mary Ellen Mark . They called on Ms. Mark ' s husband , Martin Bell , a British film maker , to help turn these still lifes into a movie . Over a two-month period , a camera crew followed nine kids between the ages of 13 and 19 , and recorded 56 hours on film . The 26 hours of interviews were recorded separately .

" Streetwise " emerges as a powerful film despite its staging as a **25;277;TOOLONG . There is no narrator to introduce the characters , to provide context . All we are meant to learn about these kids is what we see . This kind of " cinema verite " almost always rings slightly false , because it is impossible to believe that people being dogged by cameras and microphones can behave naturally . The film cries out for more focus . We catch glimpses of the tragedy and adventure in the lives of these young drifters , but want more information . Where did Rat get the braces he seems to be wearing ? Where exactly do these kids live ? The film makers said they tried to be as unobtrusive as possible by using special film that didn ' t require bright lights for night shoots and tiny microphones . These technological props aren ' t sophisticated enough , however , to wring out all the self-consciousness from the film .

" Unfortunately , director Richard Donner has muffled that tender heartbeat under blustery , anachronistic layers of up-tempo , cop-show music and wisecracks that might work in a Neil Simon comedy but seem out of place in 13th-century France . The story goes like this : The powerful ( and evil ) Bishop of Aquila adores the beautiful Isabeau of Anjou . But she loves Etienne Navarre , who works for the Bishop as captain of the guard . When the Bishop finds out about their romance , he makes a deal with the devil . Isabeau sprouts talons and wings  --  becomes a ladyhawk  --  by day ; Etienne turns into a wolf by night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans . A prison escapee known as " The Mouse " meets the exiled lovers and helps them break the spell . Mr. Donner , who directed " The Omen " and " Superman the Movie , " has had some experience handling movie versions of myth and mysticism . But " Ladyhawke " is a mess . It looks as though the movie makers couldn ' t figure out whether they were sending up medieval movies or whether they were playing it straight . The landscape ( the movie was filmed in Italy ) and costumes strive for authenticity . There are lots of coats of mail and crossbows and moats . Then we hear The Mouse , who is meant to be a comic character , talking to God in the language of contemporary Jewish shtick . Perhaps actor Matthew Broderick has been acting out Neil Simon ' s youth onstage for such a long time by now that he can ' t shake loose that wisecracking persona . Things get worse when they get serious . When The Mouse first sees the hawk in its human form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Are you flesh or are you spirit ? " " I am sorrow , " she answers with a great deal of feeling . Maybe she had an idea back during shooting of the disappointment that " Ladyhawke " would be.
