Missing from this first direct vote in almost 20 years is the middle of the political spectrum . The centrist parties found themselves at the bottom of the heap in the first round of voting on Nov. 15 , blamed by millions of Brazilians for their support of a government incapable of halting rampant inflation or addressing dire economic and social problems. // The Dec. 17 election , which will complete a gradual return to democracy that began in 1978 , is expected to be close . It pits Luis Anacio da Silva - known as Lula - of the Workers ' Party , against Fernando Collor de Mello , a former state governor and corruption fighter who created the National Reconstruction Party expressly for his presidential run. // // In the final weeks of the campaign , Mr. da Silva has been closing in on Mr. Collor ' s initial 10-point lead in the opinion polls . The latest opinion polls released yesterday indicated a difference of one point between the two candidates , with Collor showing 46 percent of the intended vote and Da Silva , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say. // No matter who becomes the country ' s first popularly elected president since 1960 , the risks for Brazil are big . Analysts say that the danger with Collor is his personalist approach . If his policies don ' t work , ' ' he could appeal to the people ( to move ) against Congress , institutions , legal forces , ' ' says Jose Augusto Guilhon , head of the University of Sao Paulo ' s political science department . ' ' Look at the language he uses : ' I and the people. ' ' ' // Da Silva , analysts say , would have to deal with pressure from supporters whose political stripes range from communist to social democrat. // ' ' If things go badly he won ' t get much cooperation ( from politicians ) , and the radical left may push harder , ' ' says Bolivar Lamounier , a political scientist with the Sao Paulo Institute of Economic , Social , and Political Studies . He adds that radical supporters could push da Silva to take stronger action on issues such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the right. // The candidates share some attributes . They are the only two serious young newcomers among the 21 candidates who ran in the first round . Political analysts say this shows that the voters , disgusted with the current government of President Jose Sarney , want change. // Mr. Sarney ' s shortcoming was his failure to tame inflation , which came to more than 171 , 000 percent over his five-year term and is expected to reach 50 percent this month . Sarney was unable to stand up to politicians and businessmen who benefit from profligate government spending , the main cause of inflation . Also during his term , Brazil ' s already huge gap between rich and poor widened even more . ( See Brazil economic story , Page 8 ) . // The two presidential candidates are the fruit of 21 years of political repression under a military government that gave up power in 1985. // Da Silva began organizing Sao Paulo factory workers in the late 1970s , outside of the government-controlled union framework . He led three major strikes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved into the Workers ' Party , which last year won several key mayoral races and has a small congressional presence . The party also has strong ties to the progressive wing of the Roman Catholic Church , which organizes many poor communities in Brazil. // The Workers ' Party stands out among Brazil ' s political parties because it has a loyal following and a fairly clear ideology . Most other parties center around a particular politician and function only at election time. // Da Silva ' s election platform calls for deep change . He believes that Brazil should concentrate its vast natural , industrial , and human resources on economic development and better income distribution . This means stopping payment on the $111 billion foreign debt and rerouting farm and industrial production to local consumption . Over the past decade , Brazil has focused much of its economy on selling exports to pay interest on the debt. // Collor ' s support comes largely from Brazil ' s legions of uneducated poor , a legacy of a military government that critics say did not invest enough in health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media mogul , Collor makes vicious attacks on the Sarney government and promises to do away with corrupt , overpaid government officials and workers . His candidacy has also benefited from news coverage on TV Globo , Brazil ' s main television network , with which he has family connections. // ' ' Lula ' s public statements are censored , ' ' says a Globo news reporter , ' ' he isn ' t shown talking about poor versus rich or capital versus labor . . . So the candidate doesn ' t appear on television the way he really is. ' ' // Collor ' s election platform reasons that more money can be spent on social needs once the government is trimmed back and put on a more moral track . He favors privatization of many state-owned companies and better tax collection . His proposal on the foreign debt is a novel one that won ' t be likely to please bankers : to remove the federal guarantee on the debt and allow each debtor to negotiate with each of its creditors. // A skilled communicator , Collor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To keep his campaign promises , Collor is counting on the legitimacy and credibility that this first direct presidential election is expected to provide the victor. // Brazil ' s lower classes will decide the election , since 75 percent of the electorate are poor . But most of these voters appear reluctant to choose da Silva , a lathe operator who , like many Brazilians , speaks Portuguese with many grammatical mistakes. // ' ' People are afraid of the Workers ' Party . They are afraid of strikes , because they mean violence and losing jobs , ' ' says Prof. Lamounier . Collor ' s campaign has played on this concern. // Research shows that da Silva ' s supporters are mostly skilled urban workers and low-income residents in areas where the Catholic Church is active . These types of voters are still a minority among Brazil ' s poor , most of whom are illiterate. // Da Silva has recently gained crucial support from Leonel Brizola , a socialist who placed third in the first round of the election. // In the final days of the campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerity in question and win over the uneducated poor. // ' ' I know what it ' s like to be poor , ' ' he told television viewers last week , ' ' so I can change the lives of the poor.
