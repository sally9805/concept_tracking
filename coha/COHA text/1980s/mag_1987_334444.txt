With the " Baby M. " case still unresolved , another surrogate dispute ended in San Diego last week with an unorthodox divided custody . High School Science Teacher Mario Haro and his wife Nattie say her second cousin , Alejandra Munoz , agreed in 1985 to bear a child for them for a $1,500 fee but then demanded more money . Munoz , 20 , claims the Haros had falsely assured her that after three weeks the embryo would be implanted in Nattie Haro . The child , Lydia Michelle , was born in June . The settlement approved by a judge will permit Munoz to see the child several days a week , and will give her $50 a month in child support . The case signals how common such disputes may become . Munoz and the Haros , who wrote their own brief surrogate contract , used a syringe to accomplish the artificial insemination without a doctor 's involvement .
