Franey is supremely happy living in a rich agricultural area on the ocean where there are plenty of native vegetables , herbs , and fresh fish , plus friends and family who enjoy having him do the cooking. // ' ' When the days grow hot , I move to my summer place on Gardiners Bay at the eastern end of Long Island , not far away , ' ' he says . ' ' It ' s my seasonal trade-off. ' ' // This is his modest beach house , where he spends as much time as he can , even when the weather isn ' t very hot. // It ' s a very small place . There ' s hardly room in the tiny kitchen to wash dishes , let alone cook the wonderful French , American , and other dishes that have made him a famous chef and well-read food writer for the New York Times. // The house is right on the beach , with lots of sun , sand , and sea breezes , as well as a kitchen garden full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thyme . ' ' It ' s well worth the kitchen inconveniences , ' ' he says. // ' ' Next to fishing , the thing I like most about summer is cooking outdoors , ' ' he commented in an interview at the beach which also included a visit to the much-photographed Franey kitchen in his year-round house , a kitchen he designed himself. // On the little beach he sautes , poaches , and barbecues all kinds of delicious foods , including fish and many of the other good things he writes about. // In summer , he says , he never tires of cooking , serving , and eating bluefish . But he also likes to cook mussels , clams , lobsters , trout , and salmon , as well as porgies , mackerel , flounder , fluke , and weakfish. // This is the place where the family has spent summers , weekends , and holidays for the past 25 years or so - where the children learned to swim , sail , and fish and where Betty , Mrs. Franey , became involved in conservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , the beach was beautiful and son Jacques , who would like to have a restaurant some day , was home for the weekend from Cornell University , where he studies hotel management. // Jacques collected driftwood on the beach as his father told me about the grill he had had made-to-order , because he found camping stoves were not sturdy enough and hibachis too limiting. // ' ' I wanted to be able to do some really ambitious cooking outdoors , like poaching fish , ' ' he said . ' ' But I needed equipment I could easily carry in and out of the house and fit in the trunk of the car. ' ' // So he designed his own device , which is sturdy and large enough for one cut-up chicken and a couple of pounds of sliced potatoes and sliced onions . It is excellent for sauteing trout , several at a time , he said. // There are directions for making the grill , and for making an inexpensive smokehouse , in ' ' Pierre Franey ' s Kitchen , ' ' which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 ) . // This book draws on the wealth of information that has appeared in the Pierre Franey column ' ' Kitchen Equipment ' ' and on his 40 years of cooking experience. // In the book , he selects 101 kitchen implements and tells how to choose them and how to use them , sharing recipes for each one. // There are commonplace and unusual dishes and pans , from woks to sabayon pots , including skillets and casseroles. // With clear , helpful illustrations for each piece of equipment , the book is a catalog , cooking course , and cookbook all in one. // In the article about stockpots and soup kettles , he explains that the soup pot is shallower and wider , so it allows you to reach into the pot to stir onions or leeks before the liquid is added. // This is necessary for a clam chowder , because it has many solids that can burn if not stirred now and then - and for any creamed soup that needs to be stirred to avoid burning. // The pot isn ' t limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for boiling beef or ham , as well . The one he uses has an 8-quart capacity. // Here is his recipe for chowder . <> <> Manhattan Clam Chowder <> 24 chowder clams <> 4 cups water <> 4 strips bacon <> 2 cups finely diced carrots <> 1 1/2 cups celery , cut into small cubes <> 2 cups chopped onion <> 1 cup chopped green peppers <> 2 cloves garlic , chopped <> 1 teaspoon thyme <> 1 bay leaf <> 2 cups tomatoes <> 4 cups potatoes , cut in 1/2-inch cubes <> Salt and pepper to taste // Wash clams well and drain .
