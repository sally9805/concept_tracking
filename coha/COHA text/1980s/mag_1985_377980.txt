We are sorry we are not able to bring you our usual program . " Instead of using its regular signature tune , the British Broadcasting Corporation began some radio transmissions early last Wednesday morning with an apology . For many viewers and listeners , it was about the only news they got that day . For the first time in 63 years , news programming on the BBC was silenced . The cause : a 24-hour strike . Workers at most of Britain 's independent TV and radio stations walked out in support . <P> The protests were directed at the governing board of the BBC . The previous week , after objections from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 's Home Secretary , Leon Brittan , the board had canceled a television documentary that featured interviews with Irish extremists , including an alleged leader of the Irish Republican Army . Thatcher , the target of an I.R.A . bomb last October , had declared a month ago that terrorists should be denied the " oxygen of publicity . " <P> As the controversy grew , Brittan said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any member of the public . " The board of the nominally independent BBC maintained that it had acted because the program was " unbalanced . " Others charged that the government 's action was censorship . " Unfortunately our board of governors , appointed to be the watchdogs of liberty , failed to bark , " said Vincent Hanna of the National Union of Journalists . <P> Later in the week , the BBC 's director general , Alasdair Milne , said that the offending documentary would be shown once it had been re-edited to remove " certain weaknesses . " But even that was not to be . After discussions with the board of governors , Milne announced that it would probably not be aired at all this year .
