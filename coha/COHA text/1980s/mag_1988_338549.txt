On the field , the English national team played bravely and well against Holland before being eliminated , by a score of 3-1 , from the European Championship soccer tournament in West Germany last week . Outside Dusseldorf 's Rheinstadion , however , England suffered a shameful defeat  --  at the fists and feet of its own unruly fans . After a weeklong rampage through four West German cities , about 250 English hooligans  --  some wearing T shirts reading INVASION OF GERMANY 1988 , others with their faces painted in Union Jack colors  --  had been detained for drunkenness , looting and fighting . One Irish fan died , drowning in Frankfurt 's Main River apparently while intoxicated . The rowdies left a trail of destruction that included dozens injured and hundreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of property damage . Outraged , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons , " The scenes that we have seen on our television screens are a disgrace to civilized society and make us feel ashamed that any of our people were involved in them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English fans over the years , last week came as no surprise . English soccer clubs have been banned from the Continent since 1985 by the Union of European Football Associations ( U.E.F.A. ) following one of the most horrific episodes in soccer history . Three years ago , Liverpool fans attacked Italian boosters during a game against Turin 's Juventus club in Brussels . In the stampede to get out of the thugs ' way , 39 people died and some 450 were injured . <P> British authorities subsequently clamped down at home by banning alcohol sales in stadiums and installing closed-circuit TV monitors and metal detectors . No use : the rowdy element among the fans  --  mostly young men who labor in manual trades  --  kept up its nasty ways in incidents around England . <P> British and West German officials began exchanging information on the most violent offenders months ago in preparation for last week 's eight-nation tournament . After the first match between England and Ireland in Stuttgart on June 12 , which Ireland won 1-0 , some 20 English thugs beat up a 22-year-old Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening ended , 107 people , most of them English , had been detained by police for drunkenness and fighting . <P> Next day the hooligans migrated north for the game in Dusseldorf . One contingent stopped long enough in Cologne to do some serious drinking , smash windows and beat up a few citizens . Twenty-two Englishmen were jailed . Meantime , throngs of rowdies roamed through Dusseldorf 's cavernous main railroad station , drinking and gearing up for the game . When a trainload of German fans arrived , the station quickly became a battleground of fistfights and splintered chairs . Miraculously , there were no serious injuries , but 130 were arrested , about 90 of them English . This time , said Dusseldorf Police Chief Hans Lisken , " the English were not the instigators . The Germans started it . " <P> On Friday in Frankfurt , site of England 's consolation game with the Soviet Union , the tireless roughnecks caroused in the city 's red-light district , despite 1,400 patrolling policemen . It was an altogether repugnant show . As a bleary-eyed fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never be in Europe again . Not even our own government will recommend us. "
