OPEC goes on a selling spree <P> Saudi Arabia has always considered itself the model of prudence and self-control among the 13 nations that make up the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries . When one of the other members threatens the group 's strength by producing too much crude oil or selling it at a discount , the Saudis are usually the first to scold . Thus Saudi Arabia has perplexed the global oil industry this summer by boosting its output by 1 million bbl. a day beyond the country 's voluntary quota of 4.5 million bbl . The extra crude has aggravated the world 's surplus of oil and triggered a dramatic slide in prices . The situation again threatens OPEC 's power to control the cost of crude . In March 1983 , the countries were forced to make their first price cut in history , a $5-per-bbl. markdown , to $29 . <P> Fears of a free fall in crude prices resounded last week throughout the oil industry . Said Gulf Chairman James E. Lee : " I think we are kind of on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standard Oil of Indiana lowered the rates they would pay for some types of U.S. crude by as much as $2 per bbl. , to $26 . The trend may force two big producers , Britain and Nigeria , to mark down the official price of their crude . Said Constantino Fliakos , oil analyst at Merrill Lynch : " If that happens , OPEC ultimately would suffer and have to lower its official price again . " <P> The price slide was triggered by an unusual Saudi deal in which the country plans to exchange some 34 million bbl. of oil for ten new Boeing 747 jetliners . Saudi Oil Minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani protested the arrangement because it would add to the glut on the world oil market . But Prince Sultan , chief of the military and the national airline , overruled him , apparently because the royal family wanted to avoid dipping into the country 's foreign-exchange reserves to pay for the planes . By exceeding its OPEC production quota , Saudi Arabia provided an easy excuse for most other members to do likewise . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . Despite the economic boom in the U.S. , West European countries have been slow to recover from the worldwide recession . Total oil purchases by Western industrial countries have increased by less than 4% since last year . Meanwhile , OPEC 's total output has gushed up about 30% , from 14 million bbl. a day in mid-1983 to some 18.5 million currently . <P> Airlines , chemical manufacturers and other heavy petroleum users will benefit most from the falling prices . Consumers , too , will feel an impact . The average price of gasoline in the U.S. has dropped to $1.18 per gal . from $1.25 a year ago , and is likely to fall further . The surge in supply , though , could put a sharp kink in the profits of U.S. oil companies . Last week Frank Kneuttel , of the Gintel energy-research group , warned clients away from energy stocks . Said he : " The price is like a snowball coming downhill without a mogul to stop it . " Falling prices will also hurt Mexico , Venezuela and other countries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
