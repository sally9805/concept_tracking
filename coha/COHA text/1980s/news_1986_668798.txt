A decade ago high-flying home builders needed only to prove that they could put up walls before buyers would plunk down money for a home . In today ' s more competitive environment , buyers are scrutinizing both exteriors and interiors . Good interior design today is a prime requisite for sales in all price ranges , say industry members . " It used to be that builders couldn ' t construct houses fast enough , and whatever they built they would sell , " said John Kamin , vice president of the Bigelow Group , Inc. based in Hoffman Estates . " Those days are gone . Different market conditions and increased competition followed the last housing depression in 1980 and 1981 , so builders had to start addressing the needs of their potential buyers more carefully . " No longer are consumers as impressed just by bigness or exterior features , he said . " Consumers today are a lot smarter . They have an eye for value . In every subdivision , the best seller will be the house that delivers the best value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest or the fanciest or the shmaltziest . " One result has been to force builders to pay much more attention to interior design to attract buyers . " When the cost per square foot of building a house was low , the builder could attract buyers by making the house bigger , " said Kamin . " When he needed a different room to fulfill a different purpose , he could just add a room . Now , builders are making the existing rooms more flexible , more utilitarian . " One example is an innovation Bigelow introduced into one of its kitchens . " It ' a built-in table that ' s about 36 inches off the floor . It serves as a food preparation area , as well as a place to eat . During non-meal hours , the table can be used as a desk . " " This allows the family to accomplish several purposes in a relatively small kitchen space , " said Kamin . " It takes the place of the table and chairs , the writing desk , the expanded countertops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don ' t do all those activities at the same time . " The innovation has been so popular that the company has agreed to make it available to buyers of other models . " We don ' t like to make changes in houses , " he said , " but so many people have asked for it that we ' re going to add it as an alternative to other floor plans . " Another aim in today ' s home design is to remove " psychological barriers " to buyers ' enjoyment of the house , said Kamin . " The great room in our bi-level house is 18 feet across , " said Kamin , " but with the cathedral ceiling the room has a lot more volume than with an ordinary ceiling . More people can use the room at the same time wihout feeling crowded . " Appropriate use of space , and such things as good mirror placement " allow a room to visually have more space than it really does , " said Kamin . " When you have second floor space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of using a wall , visually you elongate the space . " In houses that include glassed-in " solar centers , " it ' s good to put sliding doors between the master bedroom and the solar center . " Many builders are making bedrooms into double-duty rooms , " he said . " Bedrooms have become computer spaces and study areas for the kids . You have to worry about where to put the desk , where the computer will go . If you have a room 10 feet by 10 feet , you can build in the bed system and the bookshelf system and you make that room much bigger than an ordinary 100- square-foot space . " If a kid has to jump over the bed to get to his desk in order to study , and then he has the dresser looming over his shoulder , it ' s too confining . He ' s not going to want to stay in that room and study . He ' s going to go down to the family room or someplace else . If you can take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much nicer place to be in . " A prime emphasis in today ' s higher cost environment is on making optimal use of available space . " When builders were able to put houses up for $25 per square foot , it didn ' t matter how much space was wasted , " said Kamin . " Now , depending on the product line , the raw cost may be $60 per square foot . " This prompts builders to look much more critically at such things as hallways and closets , he said . " Closets are under stairways , and they have built-in drawers and suit racks and shelves . You see far fewer hallways now . You used to have a lot of hallways maybe 4 feet wide and 20 feet long . These days , that space is incorporated into existing rooms and floor patterns to extend the living space in the house . At $60 per square foot that hallway costs $4 , 800 . If the average buyer knew what it cost to provide that , he would be much more reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Couldn ' t you have minimized that hallway ? ' " Michael Schall , vice president of Sundance Homes Inc. in Woodridge , also has seen increased attention to interior design as a result of increased competitiveness . " Kitchens and bathrooms have gotten the most attention in the media during the past two years , " said Schall , " but builders are concentrating not only on these but also on the total plan . " The response to these new challenges has been varied , he said . " In the Chicagoland market , the preference is strongly for traditional homes . We had to figure out how to create additional volume in the basically very traditional two-story houses . One thing we did was put 9-foot ceilings in our Dartmouth Model . People would enter the house and they would often say , ' This house feels good . ' They wouldn ' t know why . I finally put a sign in the model that said : ' Feel wonderful ? Note that 9-foot ceilings are standard . ' " Sundance is making 9-foot ceilings standard on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estates subdivision in Lake Zurich , said Schall . Prices there range from $139 , 900 to $193 , 900 . Salvatore DiMucci , president of DiMucci Development Corp. in Palatine , builds upscale houses such as those in Braymore , a community of 147 homes in Inverness . Prices there range from $400 , 000 to $1 million . In such communities , too , builders have to be aware of changing tastes of buyers , he said . " Now if we have four bedrooms on the second floor , the buyers are saying they want three bathrooms up there and two downstairs . We ' ve gone from the typical 3 1/2 baths to 5 1/2 baths . They want skylights and sunrooms and lots of windows and French doors to give an open , sunny look even in traditional homes . They love marble in foyers , bathrooms , studies , living room and fireplace walls .
