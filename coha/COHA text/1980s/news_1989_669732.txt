True , the previous champ wasn ' t exactly distinguished : the impossibly crude ' ' Beverly Hills Cop II , ' ' starring Eddie Murphy as a wisecracking policeman . But a winner is a winner , and there ' s no disputing the built-in popularity of the ' ' Indiana Jones ' ' format that director Steven Spielberg and executive producer George Lucas have so cleverly cooked up . Indy ' s third offering pulled in more than $10. 5 million May 27 and set house records at many theaters , according to Variety , the entertainment newspaper . Looking beyond opening day , its first 12 days reportedly pulled in $70 million - dwarfing even the mountainous earnings of Indy ' s last outing , ' ' Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , ' ' not to mention the adventure that started his career , ' ' Raiders of the Lost Ark.

This time his father , an archaeologist with a quieter and more scholarly style , has disappeared while researching the Holy Grail and tracking down its centuries-old hiding place . Adding spice to the story is a likable cast including not only the expected Harrison Ford and Denholm Elliott but also Sean Connery , an inspired choice as Indy ' s feisty pop . The settings of the story range from the Middle East to the heart of Germany in the Nazi years. // Since a zillion moviegoers will see any Indiana Jones film no matter what reviewers say , there ' s little point in reporting whether ' ' The Last Crusade ' ' thrilled or bored me more or less than its predecessors did . As it happens , Indy ' s new escapade seems reasonably fresh and energetic much of the way , although it bogs down in a silly chase ( on a military tank ) just when it needs a shot of real inventiveness , and the last third has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The film ' s style is a tad more muted than it might have been , as if Mr. Spielberg were tiring of his own visual pyrotechnics , but it maintains the formulas that have made the series so successful. // More important to observe is that Spielberg and Mr. Lucas have toned down some distasteful angles that made their previous collaboration , the ' ' Temple of Doom ' ' adventure , not just frivolous ( as Indy ' s stories invariably are , almost by definition ) , but downright offensive . True , the main female character of ' ' The Last Crusade , ' ' played by Alison Doody , has a nefarious streak that prevents her from being a true heroine and revives old stereotypes of the scheming , two-faced woman who can ' t distinguish between facts and emotions - and shouldn ' t be trusted even if she could . Yet she ' s more resourceful than the woman Kate Capshaw played in ' ' Temple of Doom , ' ' a continually helpless damsel who needed rescuing every two minutes and did more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Kong. ' ' // Also soft-pedaled in ' ' The Last Crusade ' ' are the racist implications that became uncomfortably strong in ' ' Temple of Doom , ' ' where Indy strutted like a Great White Hero among people of color who were consistently helpless , villainous , or both . I don ' t think Spielberg or Lucas consciously intended any racist or sexist reverberations in that movie , but they should have been far more alert when they decided to base their Indy series on styles borrowed from Hollywood matinee serials of 40 years ago . Unfortunately , they picked up some very dubious baggage along with the appealingly nostalgic nuggets they unearthed and recycled . It ' s encouraging to see that they mostly avoid this trap in their latest venture. // In other ways , ' ' The Last Crusade ' ' is about what you ' d expect from the people who made it . Lucas likes to pull a father-figure out of his hat when he ' s ending a trilogy ; so the senior Mr. Jones makes an appearance here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s benign daddy when the ' ' Star Wars ' ' series drew to a close. // Also predictable is the film ' s simplistic treatment of themes from religion and myth . In the first Indiana Jones picture , ' ' Raiders of the Lost Ark , ' ' the biblical Ark of the Covenant almost fell into the hands of bad guys , who would have used its ' ' awesome power ' ' for evil ends - and ' ' The Last Crusade ' ' follows exactly the same pattern , only with the Holy Grail this time . It ' s curious that Spielberg and Lucas see these venerated objects not as symbols of divine inspiration but as repositories of a blind , undiscriminating force that can be wielded ( like the three wishes from a genie or a magic lamp ) by whoever gets their hands on them. // The same way of thinking crops up in other contemporary films , such as ' ' The Seventh Sign , ' ' in which the heroine prevents some biblical prophecies from coming true , thereby delaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This all adds up to a foolishly superstitious view of religious themes - especially disappointing when coming from someone like Lucas , who ' s allegedly a sincere student of religious and mythical motifs in world culture. // This may be taking ' ' Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ' ' more solemnly than it deserves , but since so many people will see it , we ' d best be aware of the notions it embodies and the messages it delivers. // On the evidence of ' ' Willow ' ' and the Indiana Jones pictures , Lucas seems permanently stuck in a trivializing attitude toward the timeless material he likes to employ . Spielberg has shown a bit more potential for growth , moving toward a more mature world view in ' ' The Color Purple ' ' and ' ' Empire of the Sun ' ' than he showed in his earlier films . ' ' The Last Crusade ' ' is a step backward for him , but backwardness is an integral part of the Indy series right from its kiddie-matinee origins .
