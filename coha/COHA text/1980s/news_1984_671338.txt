In the world of business , such new marvels as electronic spread sheets for accounting projects and low-cost word processing have indeed made their mark . Electronic spread sheets such as VisiCalc , Lotus 1-2-3 and Multiplan have unveiled new horizons inconceivable before the advent of personal computing. // For the home , however , the promise of personal computing seems to be dwindling to games , many of which would be better played on their usual board layouts . Educational software most often resembles expensive versions of simple flash cards and more complex but impractical electronic encyclopedias. // Yet occasionally one comes across a piece of software that is at least a precursor of the unique experiences personal computing has promised . Movie Maker is such a program . It works in the Atari 800 , 1200 and 1400 XL with 48K , costs $60 and is distributed by the Reston Publishing Company Inc. ( telephone , 800-336-0338 ) . // This program , a graphics generator designed to let you make your own computer-animated " movies , " is quite different from other software on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me eliminate any possible notions of being able to crank out cartoons in the classic Disney mold . By those standards the program is crude . But by the standards of competitive graphics packages available for the home market , it is very good. // The crudeness of the artistic endeavors possible is attributable more to hardware limitations than to software . Although the Atari series of computers has good graphics capabilities - for home computers , it is state-of-the-art - any kind of detailed visual presentation involves more memory capacity and a screen with finer resolution than are available for personal computers today. // This caveat aside , along with the fact that the accompanying manual is confusing and incomplete , Movie Maker is a program capable of keeping children of the right age happily occupied , not for hours but for weeks . The program appears to be primarily geared to teen-agers. // A series of preformed shapes , including a kennel full of dog poses and several of Charlie Chaplin , affords first-timers almost instant gratification by allowing them to develop an animated sequence with just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , however , lies a lot of difficult and detailed work. // This is not to discourage anyone from using the program . I well remember as a child setting the type for my own " newspaper " one letter at a time with a little rubber typesetting kit . The end results of my efforts bore little resemblance to the samples in the advertisement for the kit , but the project left me with an enormous sense of accomplishment. // A parallel between hand typesetting and Movie Maker is apparent when you start creating your own shapes . Drawing on the computer screen , even using the joystick rather than the arrow keys , is not as simple as drawing on paper with a pencil . You are creating images almost literally one dot at a time , in a form of 20th century pointillism. // The command for drawing , like all the other commands in this program , is a simple one . It consists of pressing the P key , for " Pen . " Once the software is in this mode , the joystick becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for executing free-form shapes , and the arrow keys in conjunction with the control key better for straight lines . The color of " pen strokes " can be changed , as can the hue and intensity of solid shapes once completed. // The drawing surface does not cover the entire screen . Rather there is an outlined box to define the area of activity . This box can readily be positioned wherever the drawing is to be done . It can further be used to pick up an image on one part of the screen and move it to another . It can also be used to duplicate a drawing. // These functions greatly simplify the making of an animated " filmstrip , " for the essence of animation is a rapidly projected sequence of similar drawings , and often it is even possible to use one over and over . For example , the depiction of a spider crawling along can be achieved quite smoothly with half a dozen drawings , each with the legs in progressive positions , repeated over and over again. // THE animation effect can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate , F9 the fastest . Getting back to the spider , you can have a little arachnid crawl along quite slowly , then go faster and faster by gradations until it reaches its prey and pounces , all by using the same basic drawings and simply varying the frame rate of the various sequences . A visual modifier useful for producing motion is the K key ( for " kwickness " ) . K1 specifies one frame per shape , K2 two frames and so on up to nine per shape. // Frame rate and " kwickness " may seem much the same , but they are not . The difference is subtle to the uninitiated , among whom I include myself , but it does produce quite distinct results once one is familiar with the two procedures. // Such problems of discernment are inherent not so much in the software as in the unaccustomed user . There are other refinements to be conquered . Besides the more obvious variations of color and sound , there are options like the " jump " function , which determines how far a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " loop , " for setting the number of times a sequence is to be repeated ; " zoom , " for magnifying a drawing being worked on to allow for its polishing , and " smooth , " which automatically removes flickers from the finished project . These and other variables render Movie Maker a rather complicated program . Be prepared to spend several weeks simply becoming proficient at it. // Once conquered , however , Movie Maker offers probably the widest range of animated graphics possibilities of any software package available for personal computers today. // And as a nice little touch for all the lefties of the world , the program allows the user to reverse the usual right-handed bias of joysticks. //
