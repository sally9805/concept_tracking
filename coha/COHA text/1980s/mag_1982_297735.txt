Simon 's head was tilted slightly up . His eyes could not break away and the Lord of the Flies hung in space before him . <P> " What are you doing out here all alone ? Are n't you afraid of me ? " <P> Simon shook . " There is n't anyone to help you . Only me . And I 'm the Beast . " <P> <P> - William Golding <P> The level of suffering among these children seems to be in direct proportion to their level of optimism . Aida in the West Bank and Joseph in Belfast are far more soured on life than are Boutros and Jamila in Lebanon , who have more to be sour about . This is not surprising ; adults who have endured hardships often manage a more optimistic view than their experiences would justify . What is surprising here is that some of the children who have suffered the most are not only the more optimistic ; they also show the greatest amount of charity toward their fellows , including their enemies . This is true to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel and Lebanon . It is practically universal among the Cambodians . <P> Why this is so is mystifying . The charity level among children who suffer economic hardship is not noticeably high ; yet they , like many of the Cambodian children and the Vietnamese to follow , have been starved , brutalized , deprived of companionship , parents , love . It may have something to do with the suddenness of these assaults . Slum kids die slowly , their lives eroded at so languid a pace that even they would have trouble tracing the disintegration . To the children of war death explodes like a car bomb . They simply may not have the time to seethe or develop their hatreds . For them the exercise of charity may be an automatic protection , an instantaneous striking back with the antipode of what strikes them-kindness for cruelty , generosity for spite . In short , their goodness may be a means of survival . <P> Kim Seng ( see above photograph ) has survived quite well for someone who , when he escaped into Thailand two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor , was killed by Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge soldiers . The policies of the Khmer Rouge included the execution of Cambodian intellectuals . Kim Seng watched his father being taken away in a helicopter , and for a long time in the refugee camp at Khao I Dang , all he drew were pictures of helicopters . <P> His mother died afterward , of starvation , with Kim Seng at her side . He was eight at the time , a member of one of the mobile work teams of children instituted by Pol Pot for their ' ' education and well-being . " The night before his mother died he was taken to her in a nearby village . He noticed how swollen she was , how frail and tired , and that she was breathing with great difficulty . Kim Seng 's mother took his hand and told him that he would very soon be an orphan . Then she said : " Always remember your father 's and mother 's blood . It is calling out in revenge for you .
