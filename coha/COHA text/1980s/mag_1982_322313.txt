Gerry Cooney has the big bat , but Champ Larry Holmes has the odds <P> The Heavyweight Championship of the World . It is as big as Primo Camera was big , as simple and , sometimes , as sad . But invariably special and occasionally alluring . Jack Johnson . Jack Dempsey . Joe Louis . Rocky Marciano . Muhammad Ali . Since caves , men have been awed by the enormous stature accompanying this title and attracted to its myth . Which is why in Las Vegas this week a $50,000 casino credit line is helpful in securing a reservation at Caesars Palace . The beautiful people are descending with their beautiful money , and so are the fight mob , the press corps and the crapshooters , all drawn to the enchantment . That too is why , across the U.S. , lines are long wherever theaters are showing Rocky III , Sylvester Stallone 's latest episode in the movie melodrama that exploits the mystique of the heavyweight championship ( see CINEMA ) . Call it the days of wine and bloody noses , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on people 's minds . An old excitement is back . <P> It so happens that Larry Holmes is the undefeated heavyweight champion of the known ( nonmovie ) world , Gerry Cooney is the unbeaten No. 1 contender with an unknown wallop , and they are fighting each other this Friday night in a small ring out behind a large gambling lor for $20 million . Including ancillary payoffs , there may be as much as $50 million involved all around . The eyes of 32,000 people will glisten in the ring lights , and the blood of 2.5 million others will heat up in closed-circuit theaters , and much of the country , and some of the world , will be waiting to find out several things : whether Holmes , 32 , was too old or Cooney , 25 , too young . Whether the champion turned out to be too much boxer or the challenger did in fact catch him with his celebrated left hook . Mainly , whether Cooney has any ability , whether he is just heavy on personal bravery and promoters ' ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just white . Holmes is better known , or at least many think they know him ; they may underestimate him . In the end both men might be known for this fight . <P> What makes the match so appealing , and makes Cooney the heart of it , is a memory of when heavyweights could hit and boxing matches could end abruptly . Holmes has the more refined ability , the broader experience , the odds going in and the championship ; Cooney has the " big bat . " Holmes has had 39 professional fights and has won 39 , to pitifully small acclaim . The most damning thing that can be said of him is that he took on and defeated all of the " best " of his time : 29 knockouts , ten of eleven in defense of the World Boxing Council title he has held for four years . This is a record that might be associated with a puncher , but Holmes is a boxer . In the opinion of Ray Arcel , 82 , the dappled sage in Holmes ' corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Walcott , who could hit you on top of the head and knock you out . " The heavyweight champions Arcel is ignoring include Rocky Marciano , Ingemar Johansson , Sonny Listen , Joe Frazier and George Foreman . Of recent challengers , Earnie Shavers possessed the closest thing to the big bat . Holmes whipped Shavers twice .
