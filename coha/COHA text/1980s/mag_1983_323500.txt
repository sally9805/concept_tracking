Soviet spy satellite threatens to leave a trail of radioactive debris <P> While the rest of the world anxiously watched and waited , the Soviets struggled last week to keep one of their spy satellites from plunging prematurely and dangerously back to earth . The high drama was reminiscent of NASA 's unsuccessful attempt to control the fall of Skylab four years ago , when fragments of the unmanned U.S. space station harmlessly hit the Australian outback . But the problem with the Soviet satellite had a particularly frightening element . Aboard the faltering Red star was some lethal cargo : a miniature nuclear power plant that could spray deadly radioactive material over a wide swath of the earth . <P> The object of the international concern was a spacecraft innocuously dubbed Cosmos 1402 . Launched last August , it is a five-ton bundle of electronics , including a powerful radar used by the Soviets to track U.S. naval vessels . In 1978 a similar satellite , Cosmos 954 , scattered radioactive fragments over Canada 's Northwest Territories . Though no one was killed or injured , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the difficult cleanup . <P> Initially , Soviet officials brushed off Western concern about the satellite : But as evidence accumulated from tracking stations that Cosmos 1402 was falling , Moscow finally admitted that the satellite was in trouble . Although it insisted that the reactor , containing 100 Ibs. of nuclear fuel , would burn up in the atmosphere , U.S. officials said that some radioactive debris would reach the ground . As a precaution , they mobilized special teams to gather the " hot " material . Meanwhile , Soviet ground controllers were radioing a flood of signals to the errant craft , which is tumbling wildly through space at an altitude of about 150 miles , in an effort to control it . Unless they succeed , Pentagon sources said , Cosmos 1402 will make a fiery , meteor-like re-entry into the atmosphere before month 's end , possibly around Jan. 24 . <P> Because of the highly inclined plane of the satellite 's orbit ( about 65 to the equator ) , Cosmos 1402 could crash almost anywhere , from as far north as Greenland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path precluded any rescue attempt by the new U.S. space shuttle Challenger ; even if it could be launched in time , it would be unable to achieve so tilted an orbit . As to just when Cosmos 1402 might strike , one U.S. intelligence officer said : " We 'll be able to make some hard calculations about the time and place of landing when the satellite 's period the time it takes to make a complete swing around the earth degrades to 87.4 minutes . " Last week Cosmos 1402 was circling once every 89.3 minutes . <P> The Soviets have been launching ocean-surveillance satellites at the rate of two or more a year . Their radars and other sensors are not run by electricity from solar panels or chemical fuel cells , the power sources used by American spy satellites like the Air Force 's Big Bird . Instead , the Soviet satellites rely on a type of small , portable nuclear reactor called Topaz ( after the gemstone ) , which uses as its fuel enriched uranium 235 , the same highly radioactive material " burned " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
