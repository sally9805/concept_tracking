After smoldering in the coal fields of Virginia and West Virginia for two months , a strike by 1,500 miners against the Pittston Coal company flared last week into a fast-spreading wildcat walkout . More than 20,000 union miners struck in sympathy with the Pittston workers , shutting down mines in six states from Pennsylvania to Tennessee . <P> The Pittston miners worked without a contract for 14 months after the firm demanded cost-cutting changes in work rules and health and pension benefits . Last week United Mine Workers president Richard Trumka called upon other labor unions to support the strike . Speaking at a rally in Charleston , W. Va. , attended by leaders of the airline-machinists and communications-workers unions , he said , " It 's time that we stood up as a large family and fought back . " But so far , it is mostly the miners who are aflame .
