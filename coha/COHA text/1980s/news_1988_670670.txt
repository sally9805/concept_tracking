The decision was a major victory for the military equipment industry , which has been deluged in recent years with dozens of suits by injured military personnel and victims ' survivors . The ruling will probably spell an end to many , but not all , of the dozens of personal injury suits pending against military contractors around the nation , Most major contractors and the Reagan Administration had urged the Court to rule essentially as it did today in holding contractors immune for design defects in equipment , as long as they follow " reasonably precise " Government specifications and tell the Government about known dangers . <> <> Usurpation Is Seen // Three dissenters accused the majority of usurping Congress ' s legislative role by creating out of whole cloth a " breathtakingly sweeping " defense for the purpose of " absolving multibillion-dollar private enterprises from answering for their tragic mistakes . " Excerpts from opinions , page A20 . The ruling came in a suit by the family of a Marine co-pilot , Lieut . David A. Boyle , whose CH-53D helicopter crashed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1983 training exercise . The suit was against the Sikorsky division of the United Technologies Corporation , which built the helicopter for the military. // Lieutenant Boyle survived the crash impact , but he drowned because of what a jury found to be a defectively designed escape hatch , which opened outward instead of inward and was thus inoperable because of water pressure . <> <> Lower Court ' s View Backed // While Justice Antonin Scalia ' s majority opinion sent the case back to a Federal appellate court for clarification of one point , his reasoning largely approved the appellate court ' s reversal of the jury ' s $725 , 000 award to the dead Marine ' s parents and sisters. // Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ' s vote apparently broke a tie between the four more liberal and the four more conservative members of the Court who originally heard arguments in the case last Oct. 13 , before he joined the Court. // Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White , Sandra Day O ' Connor and Kennedy joined Justice Scalia ' s opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun . Justice John Paul Stevens dissented separately . <> <> Need for Special Defense // Justice Scalia said a special defense for military contractors was necessary because application of the usual rules of liability might interfere with military decisions about " the trade-off between greater safety and greater combat effectiveness. " // He said a special defense was also supported by the fact that " the financial burden of judgments against the contractors would ultimately be passed through , substantially if not totally , to the United States itself , since defense contractors will predictably raise their prices to cover , or to insure against , contingent liability for the Government-ordered designs. " // The Court ' s reasoning might , for example , provide a defense against claims like those made by families of astronauts killed in the 1986 explosion of the Challenger space shuttle against the manufacturer of the parts blamed for the disaster . Most or all of those claims have already been settled . <> <> Blow to Agent Orange Claims // The decision also appears to dim the already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Agent Orange defoliant while serving in Vietnam , and who have opted out of the out-of-court settlement of most such claims , will ever prevail in their suits against chemical companies that made Agent Orange. // Kenneth S. Geller , a Washington lawyer who filed a brief in the case on behalf of 20 major military contractors and six nationwide organizations , said the decision was " an important victory for the integrity of the Government contracting process " that would insulate military contractors from potentially vast liabilities. // " The ruling eliminates the concern that contractors will on the one hand be told by the Government to produce a product designed in a particular way , and on the other hand be held liable under state law because the product , as designed pursuant to Government specifications , is found to be unsafe , " he added . <> <> ' Specifications ' Cited // Justice Scalia ' s majority opinion held that " liability for design defects in military equipment can not be imposed , pursuant to state law " when the United States " approved reasonably precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the supplier " warned the United States about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the United States. " // This legal standard was similar to those adopted by the majority of the Federal appeals courts that have considered the scope of the defense , which is variously called the " military contractor defense " and the " Government contractor defense. " // The defense is a judicial creation , based on what Justice Scalia today called " Federal common law . " Congress has never adopted proposals that it create such a defense by legislation. // Suits by injured service members against military contractors have become increasingly common in recent years , especially because the military itself is almost totally immune from liability to its personnel and so the contractor is often the only available defendant . <> <> Based on State Tort Rules // Although such suits are often brought in Federal courts , they are typically based on state tort law rules , as are suits seeking to impose liability for injuries caused by defectively designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case , Boyle v. United Technologies , No. 86-492 , requires state and Federal courts alike to shield Government contractors from any liability that might otherwise be imposed upon them under state law , whenever the contractors can show that the facts of the case fit the legal test the Court laid down today. // Justice Scalia specified that the defense the Court recognized today not only applied against service members , but could also be invoked " to prevent , for example , a civilian ' s suit against the manufacturer of fighter planes , based on a state tort theory , claiming harm from what is alleged to be needlessly high levels of noise produced by jet engines. " // Justice Scalia said the decision today would not protect contractors for " standard equipment purchased by the Government " with no governmental participation in the design. // But Justice Brennan said in his dissent that the decision meant that a military contractor could avoid liability because of " perhaps no more than a rubber stamp from a Federal procurement officer who might or might not have noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise to discover them . " <> <> ' Children Who Might Have Died ' // He added that the ruling would apparently bar compensation for injuries caused by " any made-to-order gadget that the Federal Government might purchase after previewing plans - from NASA ' s Challenger space shuttle to the Postal Service ' s old mail cars . " Among those who , hypothetically , would be denied compensation by the decision , Justice Brennan said , were " the children who might have died had respondent ' s helicopter crashed on the beach. " // Stressing that Congress had " resisted a sustained campaign by Government contractors to legislate for them some defense , " he said " the Court - unelected and unaccountable to the people - has unabashedly stepped into the breach to legislate a rule denying Lieutenant Boyle ' s family the compensation that state law assures them. " // Justice Brennan also termed the decision a " drastic " departure from the Court ' s past decisions limiting judicial creation of Federal common law. // Justice Stevens , in his separate dissent , said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawmaking venture " because the Court should defer to the expertise of the Congress on matters that involve " a balancing of the conflicting interests in the efficient operation of a massive governmental program and the protection of the rights of the individual.
