Ronald Reagan even takes his optimism to bed with him . Last Tuesday at 5:30 a.m. his phone routed him from sleep with the news that Lieut . Robert Goodman had been released by the Syrians into the eager arms of Presidential Contender Jesse Jackson . Reagan huskily brushed aside the option that he play down Jackson 's triumph . Reagan never met a piece of good news he did n't like , even at dawn . His instincts told him Goodman , Jackson , the U.S. and Reagan could all be winners . <P> By 9 a.m. he had elevated Goodman 's release to a religious experience . When he encountered an aide in the Oval Office , Reagan blurted , " Our prayers have been answered . We 've got him home . " Two hours later , the President was surrounded by somber staff members who were grappling with the larger problem of peace in Lebanon . Special Envoy Donald Rumsfeld poured out his frustration . Other aides piled high their grim tidings of confusion and doubt . Yet Reagan rummaged through the debris for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how faint . Finally Mike Deaver , who knows the inner Reagan better than anyone else , leaned over and said , " There 's got to be a pony in there some place . " The tension dissolved in laughter . <P> That punch line from one of Reagan 's favorite jokes ( Confronted with a pile of horse manure , an optimistic boy digs through it cheerfully , proclaiming , " There must be a pony in there some place " ) may sum him up better than all the words that have been written about him . Nothing about the man endures like his optimism . <P> It has carried him intact through the third year of his presidency , which legend says is the toughest . It is the rainbow he is riding into 1984 , the year described by one friend as " the fateful fourth . " This President still believes he can nudge the world into better shape . <P> Presidents in the past-Lincoln during the Civil War , F.D.R. during the Depression-have made things happen by the sheer force of their convictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , where their powers of persuasion are felt most keenly . If the economy continues to hold up , Reagan believes his fourth year will be dominated by foreign affairs . How to reach the mystic Syrian Hafez Assad and the ghostly Soviet Yuri Andropov ? He is using Goodman 's release in an attempt to change the Lebanon environment before time runs out for a settlement . In the next week or so he plans to give a major address urging the Soviets to come back to the arms negotiations . Assad and Andropov may prove to be implacable . But Reagan has had too much success for anybody to laugh at him for trying . At the same time , he has had too many setbacks for him to believe in his own invincibility . <P> Reagan has abandoned any private coyness about his candidacy ( " If I decide to run . .. " ) . Returning from California last week , he spoke frankly with his advisers about the upcoming campaign for a second term . In a singular way he is exhilarated by the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the fuselage of the majestic Air Force One , no little joy . " It sure beats TWA , " says an aide .
