Sharp swings in the prices and sales of new cars produced distortions in government reports issued Friday on wholesale prices , retail sales and industrial production for October , economists said . Wholesale prices rose 0. 3 percent in October as sharp price rises for new cars and food more than offset lower gasoline costs , the Labor Department reported . Retail sales in October plunged 5 percent for their biggest decline on record , mainly because automobile purchases fell sharply after soaring in September , when carmakers offered special incentives to clear out their leftover 1986 models , according to a Commerce Department report . The auto-driven sales rise in September was even bigger than what the department originally had reported last month . Total retail sales leaped 5. 3 percent in September , for the biggest monthly increase since the Commerce Department began keeping such records in 1967 and up from the earlier estimate of a 4. 6 percent rise . Industrial production by the nation ' s factories , mines and utilities , meanwhile , was unchanged in October from the month before . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in assemblies of new cars , the Federal Reserve Board said . " The bottom line is that things look pretty static if you take out the bulges in September and the corrections in October caused by the auto component , " said economist Charles Lee , a vice president of Northern Trust Co . Auto sales soared a record 22. 3 percent in September , only to plunge a record 18. 8 percent in October after carmakers removed the special cut-rate financing incentives . The average wholesale price of a new car increased 4. 7 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in October from a month earlier . New truck costs were up 3. 1 percent . " Excluding autos , we ' re really continuing to see more of the same recent pattern : a sluggish economy with only a slight rise in inflation , " added Evelina Tainer , chief domestic economist of First National Bank of Chicago . Tainer pointed out that retail sales rose only 0. 2 percent in October if the large drop in auto sales were removed from the index . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying had been in recent months , " she said . " Maybe consumers decided to pause for a bit , because of their high debt , and store up funds for the Christmas season . At least , I hope so . " But Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted that retail sales will show " further , but slower , growth in 1987 . " The increase in the Labor Department ' s producer price index , which measures wholesale prices , followed hikes of 0. 3 percent in August and 0. 4 percent in September . So far this year , however , wholesale prices have fallen at an annual rate of 3. 2 percent , largely because of the sharp tumble of petroleum prices earlier in the year . Economists see only a slight pick-up of inflation for the rest of this year . But some forecasters say prices will rise at a slightly faster pace in 1987 as oil prices stabilize and imported goods continue to become more expensive , reflecting declines in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies . Gasoline prices fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a 9. 5 percent gain in September . Heating oil declined 7. 5 percent after a 7. 7 percent increase . Natural gas dropped 1. 3 percent , its third consecutive decline . Food costs advanced 0. 9 percent in October , following a 0. 2 percent dip in September . Fresh fruits led the food increase with a 19. 6 percent jump while poultry rose 9. 1 percent . Beef and veal prices were up 2. 8 percent , but eggs fell 5 percent and fish was unchanged . Men ' s and women ' s apparel was up 0. 2 percent and children ' s clothing advanced 1. 3 percent . The October increase left the producer price index at 290. 5 , meaning that goods that cost $10 during the 1967 base year cost $29. 50 last month . Sales at department stores and other general merchandise stores climbed 0. 8 percent in October after falling 1. 6 percent in September . The improvement was credited to heavy store promotions of leftover fall merchandise that had not sold in September because of unseasonably warm weather . Sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the big drop in auto sales . Sales at furniture stores were down 1. 8 percent while sales at hardware stores rose 0. 6 percent from September levels . Sales of nondurable goods rose 0. 3 percent after declining 0. 2 percent in September . The Federal Reserve said that total industrial production , with no growth in October , was up just 1. 3 percent in the first 10 months of 1986 from the year-earlier level , emphasizing the continued weakness in U.S. manufacturing . Much of the weakness in October came from a 4. 6 percent plunge in production at auto plants . New autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7. 3 million units in October , down from a rate of 7. 7 million units in September . Overall manufacturing production was unchanged in October with a 0. 2 percent drop in production at factories making durable goods such as autos offset by a 0. 2 percent increase in production of nondurable goods .
