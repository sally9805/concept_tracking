The pyramid was never finished , and Oolitic did not become a prosperous tourist haven . And these days , the principal topic for Mrs. Craig and her neighbors is the disputed election in Indiana ' s Eighth Congressional District , which they say has taken longer to reach its conclusion than the most convoluted soap opera . " It ' s just terrible , " Mrs. Craig said . Oolitic and the other communities in the Eighth District have been without a Congressman since Jan. 3 , when the House refused to seat Richard D. McIntyre , the Republican candidate . In the election-night tally he had trailed the one-term incumbent , Frank McCloskey , a Democrat , by 72 votes , but state-sponsored recounts gave Mr. McIntyre margins of 34 and 418 votes , and Indiana ' s Secretary of State , a Republican , certified him as the winner. // That was not the end of the confusion . There had been allegations of ballot irregularities in more than 50 precincts throughout the 15-county district , and Democrats asserted that Republicans were trying to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Democratic-controlled House , which appointed a panel to do its own recount . <> <> House to Act Soon // Last week the House panel declared the Democrat the winner by four votes . The full House is expected to take up the matter next week. // " Rick McIntyre lost this election the day it left Indiana and went into the hands of Congress , " said Mayor John A. Williams of Bedford , Mr. McIntyre ' s hometown , just south of here in this largely Republican part of the Eighth District . " None of us wanted to admit that. " // Mrs. Craig said she had hoped Mr. McIntyre would win " because people around here felt that a local boy would take care of this area . " And she says disillusionment with the election is nonpartisan . " My mother-in-law ' s a strong Democrat , and she can ' t believe the way it all happened . I think the only fair way to do it now is to revote it. " // If a special election is called , some residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never voted in my life , and now I ' ve thought about it and decided I never will , " said David Grace , who owns an Oolitic auto repair shop . " I ' ve lost all my confidence in the system because of this . " <> <> Other Side Felt the Same Way // Mr. McCloskey , a former Mayor of Bloomington , says constituents said much the same thing to him in November and December , before the count that gave him the victory . But lately , he says , the mood has changed. // " Now people say , ' Frank , I never realized that an election could be this close , ' " he said . " In a statistically unpredictable universe , one vote can make a difference. " // Representative McCloskey says a special election would only make matters worse . " People are tired and irritated at the length of the process , " he said . " The public is basically burned out on it. " // That idea is repeated frequently in the Eighth District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that provided the raw materials for for the Empire State Building , the National Cathedral , in Washington , and Federal buildings and post offices around the nation . Farther south is Evansville , an old industrial city on the Ohio River . There is also coal mining , and the United Mine Workers sometimes play a role in area politics. // But in recent years the only constant in Eighth District Congressional politics has been change . The district has had just one two-term Congressman since 1974 , and Mr. McCloskey describes the seat as " the revolving door of the nation , though I ' m trying to slow that syndrome down . " <> <> Displeasure With Both Men // Mr. McIntyre says that since the results of the House panel ' s recount were announced , he has heard from people he hoped would be his constituents , not Mr. McCloskey ' s. // " They feel kind of helpless , " Mr. McIntyre said . " I got calls from Democrats and Republicans . People who said they voted against me called to say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll not only vote for me , they ' ll give money to the campaign . " Mr. McIntyre said that the thought of running in 1986 " obviously crosses my mind , " but that he has not decided whether to seek a rematch. // The continuing dispute bothers people like Catherine Concannon of Bedford . " Why didn ' t they just count the votes and say that ' s the way it is ? " she asked . " Reagan ' s been trying to get his budget through and here we weren ' t even being represented . I think they let it go too far. " // Miss Concannon said she had voted for Mr. McIntyre , but has not been satisfied with either candidate ' s behavior since the election. // " All they ' ve been doing is arguing and bickering , " she said . " I ' d start over with two different candidates. " // Wayne Hancock , a retired jeweler , agreed . " If one of them had bowed out gracefully , I ' d have voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This way , you wonder whether they want to represent us for traditional , patriotic reasons , or just because it ' s a high-paying job . Rick McIntyre should have said , ' That ' s the will of the people , I will step aside . ' He didn ' t , so the next time , I ' m inclined to vote for McCloskey. "  --   --  Attorney General Complains WASHINGTON , April 27 ( AP ) - Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has accused House Democrats of a " flagrant manipulation of the election process " by refusing to seat Mr. McIntyre. // In a letter to the House Republican leader , Robert H. Michel of Illinois , Mr. Meese said Friday that he was " appalled at the action of the House majority in excluding a person duly elected by the people of the Eighth Congressional District of Indiana and duly certified under the laws of that state.
