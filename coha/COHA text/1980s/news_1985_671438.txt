Two years ago , Helene A. von Damm - an ambitious emigrant from the war-ravaged Austrian countryside who had risen to a position of considerable power in the Reagan White House - caused a stir when she returned to her native land as United States Ambassador. // But when the 46-year-old Ambassador recently divorced her third husband to marry Peter G " urtler , 39 , the owner of the luxury-class Sacher Hotel , she came close to creating a scandal. // Vienna cultivates hand-kissing , but behavior that draws attention is definitely out. // A bit of an international backwater , Vienna appears to draw a rather old- fashioned brand of European diplomat to its missions , which are palatial and not exactly overworked. // Such exponents of the striped-pants school seem to feel their collective dignity ruffled by Mrs. von Damm ' s unconventional comportment . <> <> ' I Believe in Selling America ' // " I believe in the kind of public diplomacy that the Reagan Administration espouses , " said Mrs. von Damm , who keeps in shape by jogging in Vienna ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ' s highest peak , the Grossglockner . " I believe in selling America , and how do you sell America if you don ' t have a high profile ? " // Mrs. von Damm - who retains the resonant , titled surname of her second husband , a German-born banker - appears unruffled by the fuss over her remarriage . For some flashier publications , the event was a pretext to switch the tone of the von Damm saga from " The Sound of Music " to an Alpine " Dallas. " // Conversing in her office , Mrs. von Damm defended her handling of what she called " a private affair , " noting that before her former husband ( Byron J. Leeds , 52 , a computer industry consultant from Flanders , N.J. ) slipped quietly out of Vienna last November , not a word had appeared in the press about their divorce. // Mr. G " urtler , who had divorced his wife , and the Ambassador were married at a private ceremony two weeks ago in Kitzb " uhel , a chic Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras. // " So I think I handled it as discreetly as anyone could , " said the Ambassador , who has a habit of rolling German and English words into one sentence . " I don ' t know why should an ambassador , for instance , be treated differently than someone who works in the Administration. " // The Ambassador ' s birth in the Lower Austrian village of Ulmerfeld in 1938 may , for some Viennese , be beside the point . For Mrs. von Damm ( born Winter ) is a quintessentially American phenomenon , a resilient risk-taker who got herself out of her Soviet-occupied village , married an American soldier in West Germany , moved to Detroit and got divorced. // A job as a secretary in Chicago with the political-action committee of the American Medical Association led to a fateful encounter in 1965 with an actor- turned-politician named Ronald Reagan .

" It was a protected , sheltered spot , where obviously I could have made round-the- world trips with the President. // " And on the other hand , " she said , " there was the lure of the challenge to be really out on your own and take the inevitable consequences and risks. " // Her high-profile diplomacy has brought a string of American luminaries to Vienna , among them Henry A. Kissinger , Frank Sinatra and Jeane J. Kirkpatrick . She has thrown parties and raised money for Austrian charities and a museum . <> <> Urged Austrian to Visit U.S. // Under her prodding , the country ' s President , Rudolf Kirchschl " ager , made the first official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . And the Vienna Chamber of Commerce won promotional mileage when the Ambassador ' s boss , President Reagan , appeared on the White House lawn to accept a Lippizaner horse named Amadeus. // Among diplomats from other countries , there is a consensus that American-Austrian relations have improved since Mrs. von Damm arrived. // But some are inclined to attribute this development to the departure in 1983 of Bruno Kreisky , a sometimes curmudgeon of a Chancellor , and the accession of the more tractable Fred Sinowatz . Last September , Chancellor Sinowatz replaced his left-wing Foreign Minister , Erwin Lanc , with a pro- American politician , Leopold Gratz. // In an interview , Mr. Sinowatz said he and the Ambassador were good friends. // " This is something very special , " he said . " A young Austrian girl emigrates , goes to America , triumphs and comes back as Ambassador . It ' s really a fairy tale.

" // After her assignment in Vienna , she says , she may help out with her husband ' s business overseas , setting up a second residence in New York . Or maybe not. // " I don ' t belong to the people who makes long-term plans as far as my life is concerned , " she said , grinning , " because I always like to take advantage of serendipity.
