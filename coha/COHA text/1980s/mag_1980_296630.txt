It 's 50 years since Harriet Stratemeyer Adams and Nancy Drew first met . To celebrate the anniversary , and the 58th adventure of the adroit adolescent detective , The Flying Saucer Mystery , her publishers tossed a mystery-theme party for Adams , who writes the Drew dramas as Carolyn Keene . At 87 , the author is spry , but less timeless than her protge . In half a century , Nancy has aged only two years , to 18 , and done little more than change hair styles and add slacks and shorts to her swing-era sweater sets and pleated skirts . Despite a 50-year romance , Boyfriend Ned Nickerson is still allowed no more than a chaste kiss . That 's because of another relationship equally uncharacteristic of modern times , alas . " I call her my fictional daughter , " says Mrs. Adams . " And my fictional daughter always does and says what I tell her to .

Kramer as so much soap suds . Said he , spotting Barrett in the press crush : " Well , the soap opera won . " Kramer swept five major prizes in the 52nd Academy Awards show .

" Sally Field was flushed with more than her victory as Best Actress for Norma Rae . Field , who had scarcely eaten for three days because of pre-Oscar nerves , sagged into bed next day with flu and a 102 fever . So many bouquets multiplied in her sickroom that she reported weakly : " It looks like a florist shop . Or a morgue .

The film is a campy comedy about cavemen who between club fights make such momentous discoveries as fried eggs , cooked meat and gay sex . Lack of lines does n't bother Ringo , who has made plenty of wordy but forgettable flicks since the Beatles broke up . " It 's far more creative to be able to transmit all these feelings without words , " says he , adjusting skins far different from those he pounded as a Beatlemaniacal drummer boy . <P> ? <P> As Britain 's longtime touchstone of taste and guru of grace , he prided himself on the beau geste . So it was not surprising when the will of Sir Cecil Beaton , who died in January at 76 , was read that a special friend had been singularly remembered . After monetary bequests and disposition of paintings , photographs and papers accumulated in a lifetime of photography , writing and theater , Beaton made another gift .
