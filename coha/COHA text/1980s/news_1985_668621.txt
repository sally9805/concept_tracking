STATES SHOULD limit the amount of monetary damages people can collect for " pain and suffering " from medical malpractice suits , said leaders of the American Medical Association on Thursday . This reform and several others are needed to solve a major crisis facing the health-care system , the doctors said . If reform does not come , health-care costs will continue to escalate out of control , and many doctors will stop offering treatments that have a high risk of lawsuits , said Dr. James Sammons , executive vice president of the association . Sammons ' comments came at a press conference in the Palmer House called by the association to release a task force ' s report on malpractice . The report charged that the malpractice legal system has become so warped that patients who win suits receive only a fraction of the settlements , with most of the money going for legal fees and expenses . One out of every five doctors in the country can expect to be sued at least once this year for malpractice , according to Sammons and Dr. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance are approaching an average of $30 , 000 a year for doctors , and surgeons in some places , such as New York , must pay $100 , 000 a year , they said . " Make no mistake about it , " Sammons said , " society is paying these costs . Every man , woman and child in the country is paying . Physicians and hospitals are merely conduits passing these costs on to their patients . " The association report urges changes in the legal system and more effective policing of physicians guilty of malpractice and other practices harmful to their patients . Such legal measures as putting a ceiling on awards for pain and suffering , eliminating punitive damages and encouraging structured settlements providing lifelong annual payments rather than lump-sum awards should be enacted by state legislatures , the report says . Sammons said the association would suggest federal legislation to provide financial incentives to states that make the changes . Sammons said more than 90 percent of malpractice suits are filed without cause . They are filed because patients are unhappy with results beyond a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to expect perfection from their doctors , and medical science can not meet that expectation , Sammons said . The report urges doctors to see that their patients have realistic expectations and to make them aware of how malpractice litigation has raised medical-care costs . Sammons said a New York surgeon paying $100 , 000 a year for insurance may charge as much as $1 , 000 extra for each operation just to cover malpractice premiums . Sammons , however , stopped short of endorsing itemized medical bills that would give such information . Instead , he said , doctors should give their patients pamphlets on the general topic . In earlier reports , the task force has singled out efforts by Indiana and Florida to show the range of malpractice problems among states . Ten years ago , the Indiana legislature passed a malpractice-reform package that shortens the statute of limitation on physicians ' liability and limits legal claims to $100 , 000 . A state panel may award additional amounts up to $400 , 000 from a special fund . Lawyers ' fees are limited to 15 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insurance premiums in the state have remained moderate for the last several years , the association said . In contrast , reform efforts in Florida have led to what some physicians call " open warfare " between lawyers and doctors . After years of fighting in the legislature and courts , doctors have attempted to put the matter before the voters in a referendum , a move lawyers have challenged in the courts.
