For years the pesticide containing chlordane and heptachlor has been the nation 's No. 1 termite killer . Last week the Environmental Protection Agency announced that Illinois-based Velsicol Chemical Corp. , the sole manufacturer of the chemical cousins , had agreed to stop production . The company disputed that exposure to the pesticide , which has been linked to increased risk of cancer , is a health hazard . But Velsicol said it would stop making the compound , which under the brand name Termide is used in about 1 million U.S. homes each year , until the EPA is satisfied that it can safely be applied . <P> Meanwhile , environmental groups protested the EPA move .
