Altogether it adds up to the worst drug crisis the world has yet faced , according to experts , doctors , diplomats , social workers , and politicians in producing and consuming countries contacted by this newspaper in the last three months. // Some of the hopeful signs that emerged toward the end of the 1970s are being washed away in a new trafficking and drug-abusing cycle that is dulling and debilitating the thinking of young and old alike. // Southwest Asia ' s ' ' Golden Crescent ' ' ( Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran ) has taken over from Turkey and Mexico as the major world supplier of heroin . After two years of drought in Southeast Asia ' s ' ' Golden Triangle ' ' ( Burma , Thailand , Laos ) , there have been two bumper crops of opium in a row. // Heroin addiction is rising faster in Western Europe today than it did in the US in the 1960s. // A cocaine glut is forcing prices down in the US . Every day about 5 , 000 Americans are said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flood Western European markets . Marijuana seizures worldwide were up 26 percent in 1982 , according to preliminary UN figures . <> <> A new wave of man-made drugs // There is now a new twist in the drug crisis causing grave concern to UN and third-world officials alike. // The flow of drugs is not always from poorer nations to richer ones . Booming now is another surge in the opposite direction : man-made pharmaceutical pills , tablets , and capsules made legally in Europe and North America , pouring into Asia , Africa , and Latin America through aggressive legal marketing , and criminal diversions and counterfeiting. // The UN is on the brink of what some officials privately fear could be a new North-South confrontation . Developing countries - among them Pakistan , Venezuela , and Nigeria - are beginning to insist that before they can be expected to control the substances their farmers grow , richer nations must police their own drugmakers and traffickers much more strictly. // This is such a sensitive issue that few diplomats are willing to speak openly about it yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North America and Europe want developing countries to suppress supplies of opium , cocaine , and marijuana , while their own corporations and criminals push into the developing world man-made drugs that are new to local customs police and health officers and are beyond their resources to control. // The tidal wave generates worldwide sales of a minimum of $40 billion and a maximum of about $80 billion a year , UN and US estimates show . This is second only to the Exxon Corporation in global turnover . It outstrips such corporate giants as Mobil ( $59 billion in sales in 1981 ) , Ford ( $37 billion ) , and IBM ( $26 billion ) . // Drug abuse costs the US alone $26 billion a year , according to a government-financed study by the Research Triangle Institute and cited by FBI director William H. Webster . That figure includes $16 billion in lost productivity , $2 billion in medical expenses , and more than $7 billion in crime costs. // In Colombia , cocaine and marijuana generate $2 billion a year , about 10 percent of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism and war . It is welcomed by some communist nations who encourage it wherever possible. // In a statement made to The Christian Science Monitor for this series , President Reagan referred to communist countries by saying , ' ' I am sure that those who oppose us are enjoying our frustrating moments as we try to undo the harm that has been done. ' ' // ' ' A far greater number of human beings are consuming more substances than ever before - alcohol , pills , cocaine , heroin , and so on , ' ' says Kevin McEneany , senior vice-president of the Phoenix House rehabilitation center in New York . ' ' There is an explosion of new chemicals. . . // ' ' Why are human beings spending the equivalent of air fares to distant places to get high for 45 minutes ? // ' ' There must be a great void , a spiritual emptiness , in their lives. . . . ' ' // The grimmest find of this newspaper ' s probe is that at present the war is being lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught. // The tidal wave is still building in size and strength . Officials in country after country said most people had not yet awakened to it. // ' ' We ' re fighting a war , ' ' says Michael Davies , a senior UN drug official in Vienna . <> <> A counterwave of opposition // Yet there is another side. // The most significant of the Monitor ' s findings may well be this : The tidal wave is so alarming to so many people that it is beginning to generate a counterwave of popular opposition , led by parents who demand tougher laws and advocate more awareness and caring among families. // In the US , a grass-roots movement of parents , churchgoers , educators , politicians , doctors , social workers , and others is so marked that it is becoming a counterwave - perhaps approaching the significance of the environmental movement in the late 1960s - poised to transform itself from the tragic concern of a relative few to the compelling national concern of an aroused nation. // ' ' It ' s the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Kramer , president of the National Federation of Parents for Drug-free Youth , which has 4 , 000 affiliated parent groups in the US. // In Columbia , parents are pointing out to Bogota drug squads the houses where **28;23983; bazuco <> traffickers work. // In Karachi , Pakistan , women veiled in the black **28;24013; burqa <> costume of Islam took to the streets last month to demand government action . Young children followed the next day. // More and more people are realizing that the ultimate answer to combating drug abuse lies in the thinking of each individual . The US ambassador to Colombia , Lewis Tambs , is also a professor of Latin American history at the University of Arizona at Tempe . In an interview he leaned forward and said : // ' ' I took this job in Colombia the biggest illicit supplier of cocaine in the world because I saw students destroyed by drugs over a period of 15 years . At 22 they looked like 40 . This is an evil. // ' ' If I can save just one kid , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be your child . Or mine. . . . ' ' // // The need for a change of attitude // Michael Davies of the UN says : ' ' You have to change the attitude that the only way to solve a problem is to escape from it. ' ' // Prof. Arnold Trebach of the American University in Washington , D.C. , writes in a new book on heroin , ' ' Drugs are only one way of attaining an altered state of consciousness , and a relatively inferior one. // ' ' It would be infinitely better for human beings if they could reach into their own souls - through meditation or prayer - for strength , joy , comfort , for coping with the disappointments and frustrations of human existence. // ' ' But for many people this does not seem to be possible. . . . ' ' // The director of the UN Narcotic Drug Division , Tamar Oppenheimer , says : ' ' The major nongovernment groups can play a big role - churches , youth groups , Boy Scouts , Girl Guides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the police. . . . ' ' // Her principal deputy , Ramos Galino of Spain , adds : ' ' I have confidence . I just don ' t think people are crazy enough to do nothing . We all have children. . . . ' ' // European countries in particular need to exert more diplomatic pressure against drug runners of all kinds , says Dominick di Carlo , US assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters. // In an interview , Mr. di Carlo said , ' ' In most cases they are silent . They have regarded drugs as police or health matters . We in the US think this is a weakness . We think this drug epidemic is a foreign policy issue. ' ' // Here is how the tidal was formed - and some of the results : // In 1978 , Turkey , which once supplied 80 percent of US heroin , was virtually out of the illicit drug producing business. // Mexico , which had taken over as the major supplier , was busy trying to eradicate its crops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southeast Asia ' s Golden Triangle . But in 1979 , chaos erupted in Iran and the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. // Heroin trafficking patterns began an ominous shift that has yet to end . By 1981 Southwest Asia ' s Golden Crescent was the world ' s major source . It remains so today. // Worldwide seizures of heroin in 1982 were about 5. 5 tons , up 120 percent from 1980 and 170 percent from 1979 , according to reports to the United Nations Division of Narcotic Drugs in Vienna . The increase is partly from increased enforcement , but also reflects larger quantities traded , say sources . <> <> More addicts worldwide // Illegal drug figures are notoriously imprecise , but they indicate the pace and scale of growth . Europe is now said to have between 220 , 000 and 330 , 000 addicts using heroin as much as 30 percent pure compared with less than 5 percent per dose in New York City . United States street heroin is ' ' cut ' ' or diluted many more times at each stage of a much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy has as many as 100 , 000 addicts now ( up from 20 , 000 in 1980 ) , West Germany between 50 , 000 and 100 , 000 , the UK more than 40 , 000 , the Irish Republic a sudden and disturbing 6 , 000 to 8 , 000. // In Asia , the figures are even more dramatic . Those countries that grow and export illicit supplies are finding their own young people falling prey to them . But this could be the spur for taking significant actions to cut back production. // Until a few weeks ago , Pakistan was thought to have gone from zero to 50 , 000 heroin addicts in two years , and to have a total of some 300 , 000 opium addicts . But drug officials in Pakistan said last month that the heroin figure had hit 156 , 000 . The doctor who runs the only heroin treatment program in Karachi said he now believed there were 100 , 000 heroin addicts in Karachi alone , and that the number was rising. // Burma has at least 38 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure closer to 50 , 000 . Iran ' s opium abusers total between half a million and 1 million , with more than 50 , 000 on heroin. // Malaysia is a very distressing case . The US and the UN estimate opium abusers at 350 , 000 to 400 , 000 ( 1 person in every 36 ) , over 60 , 000 of them on heroin. // As traffickers scout new routes , the first heroin deaths are being reported from Bahrain . Egypt has discovered that the number of opiate users , including heroin addicts in and around Cairo , has reached half a million . <> <> Drug crisis in Poland // Nor is the communist bloc immune , for all its border patrols and guards . Police figures in Poland show 12 , 000 addicts involved in crimes in 1982 , but the publication Rzeczpospolita wrote recently that the actual addict figure in Poland was ' ' 10 times that ' ' - 120 , 000 - most of them middle-class youths who boil up locally grown opium poppy heads and call the injectable result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak , the interior minister , drug addiction in Poland is ' ' tragic . ' ' Its emergence , he said , should ' ' rock the consciences of those who uncritically promote Western life styles. . . . ' ' // The US is holding steady at about half a million heroin addicts , and Canada at more than 20 , 000. // So much cocaine has begun to penetrate the southeastern US from Colombia that there is a glut . Prices have dropped . No longer the rich man ' s drug , Colombian , Peruvian , and Bolivian cocaine is moving across the Atlantic to Western Europe in ever larger quantities. // The chief US drug agent in Bogota , Colombia , Johnny Phelps , told this writer that Europe will have more cocaine 18 months from now than the US has today ' ' unless Europeans begin to act now.
