ARARAT by D.M. Thomas Viking ; 191 pages ; $13.50 <P> All art is a collaboration , a translation if you like . . . plagiarism is a different matter , " declares a character in Ararat . D.M. Thomas has set out to prove that dictum . In The White Hotel , his collaborative efforts were a critical and popular success . That novel began as an ingenious imitation of a case history by Freud , then moved to an account of the Nazi massacre of Jews at Babi Yar , originally written by a Russian novelist , Anatoli Kuznetsov . But what was an effective device in The White Hotel has become a conceit in Ararat . The density of literary allusion in Thomas ' latest novel has rendered it virtually unintelligible . <P> For the centerpiece of his novel , Thomas has translated an unfinished story by Pushkin and supplied two alternative endings . Signs of Thomas ' other collaborations are on virtually every page : snatches of Russian poetry ; names of obscure Armenian writers ; places that evoke poems by Pushkin . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ararat is built on the ancient practice of poetic improvisation . Its key character , Rozanov , a Soviet poet and a scoundrel , has mastered the art of making up a story or a poem when presented with a subject by someone in his audience . The theme of Rozanov 's current improvisation is-improvisations . He proceeds to spin out tales about other poets who then go on to invent tales of their own . The effect resembles a garishly colored Russian matryoshka : wooden dolls within wooden dolls . <P> There is scarcely a discernible connection between the improvisers ' tales . Usually after a bout of vicious lovemaking , each bard tells a snippet of a story . A Russian seduces a teen-age Polish gymnast on an ocean liner ; an Armenian American on a pilgrimage to Soviet Armenia makes furious love with her guide . The lengthiest improvisation is narrated by the poet Surkov , who fancies he is Pushkin incarnate . After a jealous scene with Pushkin 's wife , he retells the master 's unfinished tale , Egyptian Nights , followed by a parodic string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her red lips were inviting . . . Her bosom swelled over the dcolletage . " <P> Towering over Ararat is the mountain of the same name , a symbol of unattainable purity . The characters frequently invoke it , or plan visits to Soviet Armenia so they may glimpse it in the mists . The shadow it casts upon the characters is the memory of the Turkish massacre of Armenians in 1915 . Indeed , one important figure is Everyman 's executioner , who improvises a story of how he participated in this and other mass murders . <P> As the invocation of Mount Ararat is meant to raise the eyes heavenward , Thomas ' repeated mention of Russia 's greatest poets from Pushkin to Pasternak is obviously intended to heighten the moral tone of this melodrama of murderers , scoundrels and sadistic sex . As Thomas well knows , poets have historically served as a symbol of redemption in Russia . But merely dropping their names will not redeem Ararat for readers who expected more from the author of The White Hotel . - By Patricia Blake   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
