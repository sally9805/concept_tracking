For suburban parents , whose children leave parties in cars , the consequences of too much alcohol produce sobering thoughts. // " We ' re in such a state because the kids drive , " said Barbara Ornstein , a Greenwich , Conn. , mother of two young adults . " We are so worried about the risk of life , so concerned that the child stay alive , I ' m afraid we don ' t even worry about the other negative aspects of too much alcohol. " // <> <> Legal Considerations // But even in New York City , where people usually do not drive their own cars , parents don ' t want to give parties at which the college-age guests have too much to drink . The problem is compounded by legal considerations . The drinking age is 19 in New York , 20 in Connecticut and 21 in New Jersey. // A college freshman who has become used to having a beer in New York may feel it is silly not to be able to have or serve one at home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are legally prohibited from drinking . In addition , holiday reunions often include children of different ages , so that a 16- , 19- , 20- and 21-year-old may well find themselves at the same party . The 16- year-old is not legally allowed to drink anywhere , but according to studies of drinking patterns in adolescence , a child of 16 probably has already begun to engage in mild social drinking . Depending on the state , one , two or all of the rest of the group could legally take a drink. // <> <> Opinions Vary // Opinions among parents vary widely on whether to serve alcohol or some substitute refreshment to those under the legal drinking age who , nonetheless , are accustomed to drinking wine or beer at parties . And even when all the guests are legal adults , parents are devising strategies to control their parties and minimize both the drinking and its negative effects. // Rebecca Lee of Greenwich , Conn. , throws an annual Christmas party to which she invites both her children ' s friends and their parents. // She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the hometown friends are people the children grew up with , the parents usually know them and their families well enough to make such parties feasible . " We find that when alcohol is served with adults around , especially parents , the kids just don ' t drink as much , " she said. // Another Greenwich family , who declined to be identified because their children are under the legal drinking age , have a different technique . They invite their children ' s friends with the understanding that they may not leave until the next morning . Drivers turn over their keys at the door and get them back again the next day . Often they are sent off with a hot breakfast prepared by the children themselves , who also clean up. // Lee Rodgers , the president of Warner Publishing Services , who lives in New Jersey , said he serves nothing stronger than beer to his son , who is home from Brown University , and his friends . " I also trust my son , " he said . " I think even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , especially when driving is concerned . Of course , I would be there too , not in an intrusive way , but so I could observe what was going on. " // <> <> Christmas Dinner-Dance // Bertrand and Lisa Taylor - she is director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum , he is in the investment business - recently gave a Christmas dinner-dance for their 19-year-old daughter , Laura , in their Upper East Side New York apartment . They tried to encourage self-control and adult behavior by treating the young people as they would treat their own friends . " We did the party our way and they loved it , " Mr. Taylor said . " They ' re not a different breed , after all. " // The Taylors ' party was several giant steps away from the majority of student celebrations . Instead of a keg of beer and potato chips , there was champagne punch and hors d ' oeuvres of salmon mousse and watercress , an elegant dinner with red Bordeaux wine and champagne , and a midnight snack . The guests dressed elegantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and danced to a three- piece band. // <> <> A Bartender Serves // " The atmosphere was one in which you behaved , " said Mr. Taylor , who sent out engraved invitations to the 48 guests . " You plan it , you create the ambiance . We are there . There are flowers on the table . A bartender serves the drinks . No one left this house intoxicated . And everyone had a good time . If you throw them into a garage with a beer keg you get what you programmed. " // The Taylors believe that the presence of an experienced bartender , who will notice and point out to the parents if someone has had too much to drink , is essential . They also planned the party so the first bar table served only Perrier water and soft drinks . The Taylors also stressed the importance of knowing exactly who is coming to the party and not allowing a situation in which each guest may bring a friend . The Greenwich family who insisted that the guests hand in their car keys at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more typical college affair with a beer keg and snacks , also had a carefully controlled guest list . " We didn ' t want a cast of thousands , " said the mother . The parents insisted that the number of guests not go above 25 and went downstairs several times during the party to chat with the guests and make their presence felt . " My husband did that mostly , " said the mother . " I retire to my room practically with a cold compress on my head , envisioning the mess my house would be in. " // <> <> ' The House Was Spotless ' // The family found , to their delight , that the young people behaved well . " In the morning , " the mother said , " I left breakfast to them and went out with my husband to a restaurant . When I returned the sleeping bags were gone and so were the kids . The house was spotless and they had even washed the kitchen floor . It was a very pleasant surprise. " // In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of high school juniors and seniors than with those of their college- aged children . A study , completed in 1983 , based on questionnaires administered to more than 4 , 000 Greenwich public and private school students from junior high school through high school , showed that nearly three- quarters of seventh graders had tried alcohol . By the time they reached 12th grade , 99 percent had tried it , and 60 percent said they were drinking at least once a week . " By the end of the 12th grade we seem to notice it has already peaked and levels off , " said Joan King , principal of Western Junior High School in Greenwich . " The kids are more goal-oriented , thinking about college and a little more mature. " // <> <> ' The Really Deadly Age ' // " The really deadly age is 17 and 18 , " said Mr. Rodgers , whose 20-year- old son goes to Brown University . " The last years of high school are the ones that deserve the most attention. " // A bar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded to the problem by creating a congenial atmosphere for teen-agers without alcohol . Little Dick ' s , across the street from the train station , has " boozeless Tuesdays " with a discoth eque atmosphere . It also offers an alcohol-free New Year ' s Eve party. // Many parents , educators and police officers think that a crucial prerequisite for a successful party in which alcohol is served is the presence of the parents . In Greenwich , several organizations got together and sent out a pamphlet advising parents on how to control drinking at parties during the Christmas season . The pamphlet , which urges parents to stay at home during parties and actively prevent the use of alcohol by youngsters under the legal drinking age , also contains a warning : " Parents risk criminal or civil charges if alcohol or illegal drugs are served to minors in their home. " // Mrs. King , the school principal , is concerned about parties for both high school and college students at which alcohol is served and parents are absent . " A lot of parents have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and turned a blind eye , " she said . " The kids find out in whose house they can get away with it and take advantage of it . What is striking is it often happens in the homes of some of the best families in town , who ought to know better . I mean , who do you think has the money to buy kegs of beer ?
