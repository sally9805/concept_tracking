Mr. Brown has been able to cut through the varnish applied so heavily by these well-intentioned protectors of the composer ' s name , partly because he has had access to some long-lost Tchaikovsky letters that an emigre musicologist , Alexandra Orlova , smuggled out of the Soviet Union in 1979 . These intimate letters , written to his brothers Modest and Anatoly and other family members , were finally printed by the Soviets in 1940 , but probably out of national pride were suppressed before publication . Mrs. Orlova came across them while working in the Tchaikovsky Museum in Klin. // // The documents dispense once and forever with the notion , which still can be found in program notes and on record jackets , that Tchaikovsky was a chaste esthete whose chief extracurricular interest in life was a platonic relationship with his generous patron , Nadezhda von Meck . Mrs. von Meck was a married woman with whom he corresponded regularly about all sorts of musical and personal matters but whom he met only once in the street and never spoke to . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the freeze-dried saint of popular literature . He is a man continually fighting against a homosexual drive whose power frightened him , and continually losing the battle . Partly out of fear of disgracing his family , with whom he enjoyed an almost claustrophobic closeness , he wanted nothing more than to lead a conventionally respectable life . He was not interested in coming out , as we would now say , but only in building himself a deeper and safer closet . Overt homosexuality in the Russia of his time was a crime against the state ; secret homosexuality for a person of Tchaikovsky ' s prominence had to be nothing less than a Siberia of the soul. // His decision at age 37 to marry the pretty , befuddled Antonina Ivanovna Milyukova , a young woman he had known only two months , reads like the act of a man in panic . " If I am marrying without love , " he writes to Mrs. von Meck , " it is because circumstances conspired to make it impossible for me to do otherwise . " So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into marriage with a person he hardly knew . Soon he was writing to his brother Anatoly about his scorn for Antonina : " An intelligent woman might instill fear of herself in me . I stand so far above this one , I am so superior to her that at least I shall never be frightened of her . " And again to Anatoly : " Physically my wife has become **28;146; totally repugnant <> to me . " Tchaikovsky left his bride after nine days and , it seems , tried to reconcile himself to living a secret life , in constant dread of being found out . It is clear from his letters that what he feared most in life was being exposed and bringing down dishonor on his family and friends. // // This carefully documented account of a great artist continuing to work brilliantly while on the brink of personal disaster is a moving one in Mr. Brown ' s hands . During these years Tchaikovsky produced " Swan Lake , " the First Piano Concerto , the Fourth Symphony and the Violin Concerto , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of Anton Rubinstein , who was not only a rival composer but one of the most powerful figures in Russian music . His achievements would hardly have been possible if he had not been able to keep his artistic and personal lives in tightly sealed separate compartments . But there was a price to be paid eventually , a fatal one . Mr. Brown ' s third volume will have to deal with the sticky issue of Tchaikovsky ' s suicide , about which scholars are still conjecturing and arguing . Mrs. Orlova has published research that suggests Tchaikovsky was forced to take poison on orders from a " court of honor " composed of old classmates who were upset that word of his affair with a nephew of Duke Stenbock-Thurmor had come to the attention of the Czar . Mr. Brown , in his article on Tchaikovsky in the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , discusses the Orlova contention seriously and presumably will deal with it more fully in the final volume of his biography. // Mr. Brown ' s two volumes so far elevate the discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his mournful Russian soul and his struggle against fate . He takes the works as seriously as they deserve to be taken in a time when Tchaikovsky ' s stock has risen quite a bit , perhaps partly because of the high value placed on the music by such latter-day saints of the avant-garde as Stravinsky . He is justly severe , however , with such listless efforts as the Piano Sonata , which he calls " a strong candidate as the dullest piece Tchaikovsky ever wrote. " // This second installment in Tchaikovsky ' s life is rather dark and portentous in mood on the whole , but there are light touches . I especially relished the account of Tchaikovsky ' s visit to Paris in 1875 when he struck up an instant though ephemeral friendship with Saint- Saens . Both , it turned out , thought of themselves as fine dancers , so they staged an impromptu performance of an entire ballet , " Galatea and Pygmalion , " on the stage of the Conservatoire . The 40-year-old composer of " The Carnival of Animals " portrayed Galatea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the sculptor . This story comes second-hand from Modest , so Mr. Brown feels compelled as a good scholar to note sadly that there seem to have been " no actual witnesses of this spectacle. " // In this solemnly celebrated Wagner year , I was also amused to read what Tchaikovsky thought of the first " Ring " cycle at Bayreuth in August of 1876 , which he attended as a correspondent for the Russian Gazette . He was not the perfect Wagnerite or close to it , as his summary article made clear : // " My recollection of Bayreuth remains oppressive . . . Finally on Thursday it was all over , and with the last chords of ' Gotterdammerung ' I felt as though I ' d been released from captivity . Perhaps ' Nibelungen ' is a very great work , but there ' s certainly never yet been anything more boring and prolix . . . Of course , there are some wonderful moments - but taken all in all , it ' s killingly boring ! How many hundreds of thousands of times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released captive would invoke the name of Leo Delibes , a fellow ballet composer , in opposition to Wagner was perfectly in character . Like many another musician of his time and since , Tchaikovsky believed that Wagner had led an entire art astray : " And so this is what Wagner ' s reform has achieved ! At one time they tried to make music give people pleasure - now they torture and tire them . " Down through the centuries a chasm has yawned between those who think music should uplift and those who think it should entertain . Say what you will about Tchaikovsky , there never is any doubt as to where he stands on that issue . And perhaps it is just this unwavering conviction that we feel in all his music and that gives it a character as definite and unmistakable as that of Wagner . The universe of music is large enough to contain two such ideas and only a fool should feel forced to make a choice between them. // //             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
