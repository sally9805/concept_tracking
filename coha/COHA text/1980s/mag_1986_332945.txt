After a 19-year hiatus in diplomatic relations , Israel and the Soviet Union sat down to talk last week . But even before the meeting got under way in Helsinki , the signs were inauspicious . For starters , there was no agreement on issues to be negotiated . Then , while some members of the Israeli delegation eagerly showed up four days early , the Soviets just made it to the Monday- morning meeting . While the Israelis parked 30 yards short of the Council of State compound and walked to the entrance to enable cameramen to film the historic moment , the Soviets steered their blue Mercedes past the press . <P> The talks , which were scheduled to last two days , broke up after 90 minutes . It was clear that the two sides had a disastrous encounter . " After 19 years , " sighed a Western diplomatic observer , " the Israelis and the Soviets do n't even know how to begin . " Moscow claimed at a news conference that the Israelis , instead of sticking to a narrow agenda of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by raising the prickly issue of permitting Soviet Jews to emigrate . " A preliminary meeting was held and it resulted in nothing , " said Gennadi Gerasimov , the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman . " Therefore , there will be no follow-up . " <P> The Israelis initially tried to paint a brighter picture , calling the session " candid and correct . " But the rhetoric soon heated up . In Jerusalem , Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir declared that Israel had been entitled to raise the emigration issue , since it had a valuable " asset " in the form of 2 million Soviet Jews . In Moscow , Gerasimov retorted , " That is a very arrogant interference in ( our ) internal affairs . It is like saying that all the Anglo- Saxons in America are the property of the Queen of England . " <P> The Soviet truculence left Western analysts wondering why Moscow had agreed to the meeting in the first place . Some suggested the Helsinki overture reflected the less menacing and more flexible foreign policy that General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev has been developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to play a central role in any Middle East peace process . They may also have agreed to the meeting in an attempt to defuse hostility within the U.S. Jewish community , thus lessening the chance of anti-Soviet demonstrations should Gorbachev journey to Washington later this year for a summit with President Reagan . <P> Experts indicated that the Israelis blundered in their strong insistence on the highly charged question of Soviet Jewry . Domestic politics clearly played a large role in the Israeli performance . Under a power-sharing agreement , Shamir and Prime Minister Shimon Peres are due to swap jobs in October . Some government insiders contend that Shamir aimed to undermine the Helsinki talks to deny Peres a foreign policy triumph . Hence , they say , Shamir pushed hard to put Soviet Jewry on the agenda . But if Shamir upstaged Peres in Helsinki , Peres played an impressive card of his own : on Thursday he announced he would meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak next month to warm up the cold peace between Cairo and Jerusalem . Mubarak has not yet confirmed the engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
