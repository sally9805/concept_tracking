William D. Mazzocca , a 41-year-old practitioner of an old , almost- forgotten craft , exemplifies a new breed of American businessman who , in Thoreau ' s words , is committed to stepping " to the music which he hears . " In Mazzocca ' s case , Thoreau ' s oft-quoted verse about a " different drummer " is most appropriate because the Somerville native makes brass mouthpieces for the trumpet and two other wind instruments of its class , the cornet and the flugelhorn . And , equally fittingly , Mazzocca cuts and finishes the mouthpieces in cramped , cluttered , street-level quarters at Hemenway and Boylston streets , across from the Berklee College of Music , his major customer . Across the nation , there are millions like Mazzocca who are going it alone , doing what they want to do , not something others have picked out for them to do . In 1980 , an estimated 7.3 million Americans , claiming to be sole proprietors of non-farm endeavors , filed returns with the IRS , according to Bruce Phillips , a senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten years earlier , the comparable figure was 4.9 million . " The number of self-employed persons has been growing steadily over wage and salary workers , " Phillips said . " The major reason for the increase , " he added , " is the loss of conventional jobs during the recessions of the last decade . Many of these people just decided to go out on their own . " The recessions have hurt Mazzocca financially like everyone else , but they didn ' t cause him to switch careers . He has been a craftsman all along . " I ' m probably one of the last bloodline connections to my craft , " explained Mazzocca , owner and sole employee of Tottle Brass Mouthpiece Co. , formerly Boston Brass &; Woodwind Co . ( " I thought that Boston Brass ' would go over big , but it didn ' t , " he said . ) The " Tottle " refers to his mother ' s side of the family . Mazzocca ' s grandfather , Peter Tottle , , started in 1929 what turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music store of that period . " At first , the store sold only accordions . After Tottle ' s five sons became involved in the business , the emphasis shifted to brass and woodwind repair and the making of mouthpieces . One by one , all the sons except Bill Tottle went on to other things . When Bill Tottle died in October 1976 , Mazzocca took over the business , then on St. Botolph street . Eight months later , the business - and Mazzocca - almost died . Mazzocca was involved in a serious motorcycle accident and nearly lost his right foot and leg . He has had 30 operations and only last year got a clean bill of health from doctors at Tufts-New England Medical Center . " The business would have gone under if I hadn ' t left - coincidentally - a lot of stock , " he said . " As it was , I got many calls from customers while I was in the hospital - when even I didn ' t think I was going to make it . " Even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly for members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Berklee students . " Horn modification , which we previously had done , had just been taking too much time , " he said . " You could spend most of a day testing the acoustics of a horn and come out of it with a nickel in your pocket . It didn ' t make sense to continue with the repair business , although I ' ll still handle a minor repair once in a while . " So , six days a week from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m . Mazzocca , working with a lathe and other special equipment , makes the traditional Tottle mouthpiece , consisting of rim , cup and back bore . " It ' s what I call a compatible design , " he said , " one of subtle curves and shapes . It ' s difficult to define in words . " The integral part of the Tottle mouthpiece - once used by such greats as Louis Armstrong and Bobby Hackett - is the back bore , which amplifies the sounds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great day , Mazzocca can make about 10 mouthpieces . In a year , he usually makes 500 ( at $35 each or $55 apiece for custom work ) . " There ' s no way to predict when orders will come in , " he said . " Some weeks , you starve while others you seem to fly along . The business is an exacting one , leaving Mazzocca drained physically and mentally at the end of each day . " That ' s why I leave at 4:30 sharp , " he said . Mazzocca ' s competition comes not from shops in New England but from family firms in New York City and from the largest mass- producer of mouthpieces , Bach , an Elkhart , Ind . division of the Selmer Co. which , in turn , is owned by the $3.2 billion North American Philips Corp . North American Philips would only reveal that it sells mouthpieces for $22 each . Although Mazzocca has been forced to do what he calls " some PRing , " he hasneither the funds nor the inclination to market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride in the Tottle mouthpiece to try to sell it down the pike like a McDonald ' s hamburger , " he said . " Rather , " he continued , " I ' m combating large , powerful companies like Bach that have taken over the wind instrument industry . What I ' m doing , in short , is staying in business by the skin of my teeth to produce quality mouthpieces and hoping that word-of-mouth referrals continue . " Over the years , his business outlook has been honed to doing what is possible . " I ' m not as enterprising as I once was , " he said . " When I was in my 30s , I was going to take the world by storm . That has changed , perhaps because of my accident . I continue to do what I like , but I just don ' t attempt to push a heavier wheel . "
