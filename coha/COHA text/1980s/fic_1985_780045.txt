 | nestine Littlechap and Tracy were seated there , drinking coffee during their ten-minute break . " I think it 's about time you tol ' me what your big hurry is to bust outta here , " Ernestine suggested . Tracy hesitated . Could she trust Ernestine ? She had no choice . " There  --  there are some people who did things to my family and me . I 've got to get out to pay them back . " " Yeah ? What 'd they do ? " Tracy 's words came out slowly , each one a drop of pain . " They killed my mother . " " Who 's they ? " " I do n't think the names would mean anything to you . Joe Romano , Perry Pope , a judge named Henry Lawrence , Anthony Orsatti ? " Ernestine was staring at her with her mouth open . " Jesus H. Christ ! You puttin ' me on , girl ? " Tracy was surprised . " You 've heard of them ? " " Heard of ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' goes down in New Or-fuckin ' - leans unless Orsatti or Romano says so . You ca n't mess with them . They 'll blow you away like smoke . " Tracy said tonelessly , " They 've already blown me away . " Ernestine looked around to make sure they could not be overheard . " You 're either crazy or you 're the dumbest broad I 've ever met . Talk about the untouchables ! " She shook her head . " Forget about ' em . Fast ! " " No . I ca n't . I have to break out of here . Can it be done ? " Ernestine was silent for a long time . When she finally spoke , she said , " We 'll talk in the yard . " They were in the yard , off in a corner by themselves . " There 've been twelve bust-outs from this joint , " Ernestine said . " Two of the prisoners were shot and killed . The other ten were caught and brought back . " Tracy made no comment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , and they 're mean sons of hitches . If anyone escapes , it costs the guards their jobs , so they 'd just as soon kill you as look at you . There 's barbed wire all around the prison , and if you get through that and past the machine guns , they got hound dogs that can track a mosquito 's fart . There 's a Na-  | ( onal Guard station a few miles away , and when a prisoner xcapes from here they send up helicopters with guns and earchlights . Nobody gives a shit if they bring you back dead alive , girl . They figure dead is better . It discourages anyone use with plans . " " But people still try , " Tracy said stubbornly . " The ones who broke out had help from the outside  --  friends who smuggled in guns and money and clothes . They had getway cars waitin ' for ' em . " She paused for effect . " And they till got caught . " " They wo n't catch me , " Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tracy , " Warn Brannigan wants you . On the double . " " We need someone to take care of our young daughter , " arden Brannigan said . " It 's a voluntary job . You do n't have o take it if you do n't wish to . " Someone to take care of our young daughter . Tracy 's mind as racing . This might make her escape easier . Working in the arden 's house , she could probably learn a great deal more bout the prison setup . " Yes , " Tracy said . " I 'd like to take the job . " ( ieorge Brannigan was pleased . He had an odd , unreasonable feeling that he owed this woman something . " Good . It gays sixty cents an hour . The money will be put in your account at the end of each month . " Prisoners were not allowed to handle cash , and all monies accumulated were handed over upon the prisoner 's release . I wo n't be here at the end of the month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fine . " " You can start in the morning . The head matron will give you the details . " " ' I'hank you , Warden . " Ile looked at Tracy and was tempted to say something more . Ile was not quite sure what . Instead , he said , " That 's all . " When Tracy broke the news to Ernestine , the black woman said thoughtfully , " That means they gon na make you a trusty .  | You 'll get the run of the prison . That might make bustin ' out a little easier . " " How do I do it ? " Tracy asked . " You got three choices , but they 're all risky . The first way is a sneak-out . You use chewin ' gum one night to jam the locks on your cell door and the corridor doors . You sneak outside to the yard , throw after her . Tracy could feel the bullets from the guns of the guards tearing into her . She shuddered . " What are the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's where you use a gun and take a hostage with you . If they catch you , they 'll give you a deuce with a nickel tail . " She saw Tracy 's puzzled expression . " That 's another two to five years on your sentence . " " And the third way ? " " A walkaway . That 's for trusties who are out on a work detail . Once you 're out in the open , girl , you jest keep movin ' . " Tracy thought about that . Without money and a car and a place to hide out , she would have no chance . " They 'd find out I was gone at the next head count and come looking for me . " Ernestine sighed . " There ai n't no perfect escape plan , girl . That 's why no one 's ever made it outta this place . " I will , Tracy vowed . I will . The morning Tracy was taken to Warden Brannigan 's home marked her fifth month as a prisoner . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she wanted this job desperately . It was going to be her key to freedom . Tracy walked into the large , pleasant kitchen and sat down . She could feel the perspiration bead and roll down from her underarms . A woman clad in a muted rose-colored housecoat appeared in the doorway . She said , " Good morning . " " Good morning . " The woman started to sit , changed her mind , and stood . Sue Fllrn llr:innionn wnc n nlrncantfouwd klwwd. in 1  | thirties , with a vague , distracted manner . She was thin and hyper , never quite sure how to treat the convict servants . Should she thank them for doing their jobs , or just give them orders ? Should she be friendly , or treat them like prisoners ? Sue Ellen still had not gotten used to the idea of living in the midst of drug addicts and thieves and killers . " I 'm Mrs. Brannigan , " she rattled on . " Amy is almost five years old , and you know how active they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be watched all the time . " She glanced at Tracy 's left hand . There was no wedding ring there , but these days , of course , that meant nothing . Particularly with the lower classes , Sue Ellen thought . She paused and asked delicately , " Do you have children ? " Tracy thought of her unborn baby . " No . " " I see . " Sue Ellen was confused by this young woman . She was not at all what she had expected . There was something almost elegant about her . " I 'll bring Amy in . " She hurried out of the room . Tracy looked around . It was a fairly large cottage , neat and attractively furnished . It seemed to Tracy that it had been years since she had been in anyone 's home . That was all part of the other world , the world outside . Sue Ellen came back into the room holding the hand of a young girl . " Amy , this is ? " Did one call a prisoner by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Tracy Whitney . " " Hi , " Amy said . She had her mother 's thinness and deepset , intelligent hazel eyes . She was not a pretty child , but there was an open friendliness about her that was touching . I wo n't let her touch me . " Are you going to be my new nanny ? " " Well , I 'm going to help your mother look after you . " " Judy went out on parole , did you know that ? Are you going out on parole , too ? " No , Tracy thought . She said , " I 'm going to be here for a long while , Amy . " " That 's good , " Sue Ellen said brightly . She colored in embarrassment and bit her lip . " I mean ? " She whirled around . nI , . ininn err , . nv'c rI .. tinc fn hnr " Viv . ' ll  | have your meals with Amy . You can prepare breakfast for her and play with her in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy has a nap , and in the afternoon she likes walking around the grounds of the farm . I think it 's so good for a child to see growing things , do n't you ? " " Yes . " The farm was on the other side of the main prison , and the twenty acres , planted with vegetables and fruit trees , were tended by trusties . There was a large artificial lake used for irrigation , surrounded by a stone wall that rose above it . The next five days were almost like a new life for Tracy . Under different circumstances , she would have enjoyed getting away from the bleak prison walls , free to walk around the farm and breathe the fresh country air , but all she could think about was escaping . When she was not on duty with Amy , she was required to report back to the prison . Each night Tracy was locked in her cell , but in the daytime she had the illusion of freedom . After breakfast in the prison kitchen , she walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tracy had learned a good deal about cooking from Charles , and she was tempted by the varieties of foodstuffs on the warden 's shelves , but Amy preferred a simple breakfast of oatmeal or cereal with fruit . Afterward , Tracy would play games with the little girl or read to her . Without thinking , Tracy hegan teaching Amy the games her mother had played with her . Amy loved puppets . Tracy tried to copy Shari Lewis 's Lamb Chop for her from one of the warden 's old socks , but it turned out looking like a cross between a fox and a duck . " I think it 's beautiful , " Amy said loyally . Tracy made the puppet speak with different accents : French , Italian , German , and the one Amy adored the most , Paulita 's Mexican lilt . Tracy would watch the pleasure on the child 's face and think , I wo n't become involved . She 's just my means of getting out of this place . After Amy 's afternoon nap , the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they covered areas of the prison grounds she had not seen before . She carefully observed every  | exit and entrance and how the guard towers were manned and noted when the shifts changed . It became obvious to her that none of the escape plans she had discussed with Ernestine would work . " Has anyone ever tried to escape by hiding in one of the service trucks that deliver things to the prison ? I 've seen milk trucks and food ? " " Forget it , " Ernestine said flatly . " Every vehicle comin ' in and goin ' out of the gate is searched . " At breakfast one morning , Amy said , " I love you , Tracy . Will you be my mother ? " The words sent a pang through Tracy . " One mother is enough . You do n't need two . " " Yes , I do . My friend Sally Ann 's father got married again , and Sally Ann has two mothers . " " You 're not Sally Ann , " Tracy said curtly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with hurt eyes . " I 'm not hungry anymore . " " All right . I 'll read to you , then . " As Tracy started to read , she felt Amy 's soft little hand on hers . " Can I sit on your lap ? " " No . " Get your affection from your own family , Tracy thought . You do n't belong to me . Nothing belongs to me . The easy days away from the routine of the prison somehow made the nights worse . Tracy loathed returning to her cell , hated being caged in like an animal . She was still unable to get used to the screams that came from nearby cells in the uncaring darkness . She would grit her teeth until her jaws ached . One night at a time , she promised herself . I can stand one night at a time . She slept little , for her mind was busy planning . Step one was to escape . Step two was to deal with Joe Romano , Perry Pope , Judge Henry Lawrence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was too painful even to think about yet . I 'll handle that when the time comes , she told herself . It was becoming impossible to stay out of the way of Big Bertha . Tracy was sure the huge Swede was having her spied upon . If Tracy went to the recreation room , Big Bertha would show up a few minutes later , and when Tracy went out to the yard , Big Bertha would appear shortly afterward . One day Big Bertha walked up to Tracy and said , " You 're looking beautiful today , littbarn . I ca n't wait for us to get together . " " Stay away from me , " Tracy warned . The amazon grinned . " Or what ? Your black bitch is gettin ' out . I 'm arrangin ' to have you transferred to my cell . " Tracy stared at her . Big Bertha nodded . " I can do it , honey . Believe it . " Tracy knew then her time was running out . She had to escape before Ernestine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rainbowed with colorful wildflowers . The huge artificial lake was nearby , surrounded by a low concrete wall with a long drop to the deep water . " Let 's go swimming , " Amy pleaded . " Please , let 's , Tracy ? " " It 's not for swimming , " Tracy said . " They use the water for irrigation . " The sight of the cold , forbidding-looking lake made her shiver . Her father was carrying her into the ocean on his shoulders , and when she cried out , her father said , Do n't be a baby , Tracy , and he dropped her into the cold water , and when the water closed over her head she panicked and began to choke . . . . When the news came , it was a shock , even though Tracy had expected it . " I 'm gettin ' outta here a week from Sattiday , " Ernestine said . The words sent a cold chill through Tracy . She had not told Ernestine about her conversation with Big Bertha . Ernestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertha probably had enough influence to have Tracy transferred to her cell . The only way Tracy could avoid it would be to talk to the warden , and she knew that if she did that , she was as good as dead . Every convict in the prison would turn on her . You got ta fight , fuck , or hit the fence . Well , she was going to hit the fence . She and Ernestine went over the escape possibilities again . None of them was satisfactory . " You ai n't got no car , and you ai n't got no one on the outside to he'p you . You 're gon na get caught , sure as hell , and then you 'll be worse off . You 'd be better doin ' cool time and finishin ' out your gig . " But Tracy knew there would be no cool time . Not with Big Bertha after her . The thought of what the giant bull-dyke had in mind for her made her physically ill . It was Saturday morning , seven days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into New Orleans for the weekend , and Tracy was at work in the prison kitchen . " How 's the nursemaid job goin ' ? " Ernestine asked . " All right . " " I seen that little girl . She seems real sweet . " " She 's okay . " Her tone was indifferent . " I 'll sure be glad to get outta here . I 'll tell you one thing , I ai n't never comin ' back to this joint . If there 's anythin ' Al or me kin do for you on the outside ? " " Coming through , " a male voice called out . Tracy turned . A laundryman was pushing a huge cart piled to the top with soiled uniforms and linens . Tracy watched , puzzled , as he headed for the exit . " What I was sayin ' was if me and Al can do anythin ' for you  --  you know  --  send you things or ? " " Ernie , what 's a laundry truck doing here ? The prison has its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards , " Ernestine laughed . " They used to send their uniforms to the prison laundry , but all the buttons managed to get ripped off , sleeves were torn , obscene notes were sewn inside , shirts were shrunk , and the material  | got mysteriously slashed . Ai n't that a fuckin ' shame , Miss Scarlett ? Now the guards got ta send their stuff to an outside laundry . " Ernestine laughed her Butterfly McQueen imitation . Tracy was no longer listening . She knew how she was going to escape .  | " George , I do n't think we should keep Tracy on . " Warden Brannigan looked up from his newspaper . " What ? What 's the problem ? " " I 'm not sure , exactly . I have the feeling that Tracy does n't like Amy . Maybe she just does n't like children . " " She has n't been mean to Amy , has she ? Hit her , yelled at her ? " " No " What , then ? " " Yesterday Amy ran over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . It bothered me because Amy 's so crazy about her . To tell you the truth , I might be a little jealous . Could that be it ? " Warden Brannigan laughed . " That could explain a lot , Sue Ellen . I think Tracy Whitney is just right for the job . Now , if she gives you any real problems , let me know , and I 'll do something about it . " " All right , dear . " Sue Ellen was still not satisfied . She picked up her needlepoint and began stabbing at it . The subject was not closed vet .  | " Why ca n't it work ? " " I tol ' you , girl . The guards search every truck going through the gate . " " But a truck carrying a basket of laundry  --  they 're not going to dump out the laundry to check it . " " They don ' have to . The basket is taken to the utility room , where a guard watches it bein ' filled . " Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone distract that guard for five minutes ? " " What the hell good would ? ? " She broke off , a slow grin lighting her face . " While someone pumps him full of sunshine , you get into the bottom of the hamper and get covered up with laundry ! " She nodded . " You know , I think the damned thing might work . " " Then you 'll help me ? " Ernestine was thoughtful for a moment . Then she said softly , " Yeah . I 'll he'p you . It 's my last chance to give Big Bertha a kick in the ass . " The prison grapevine buzzed with the news of Tracy Whitney 's impending escape . A breakout was an event that affected all prisoners . The inmates lived vicariously through each attempt , wishing they had the courage to try it themselves . But there were the guards and the dogs and the helicopters , and , in the end , the bodies of the prisoners who had been brought back . With Ernestine 's help , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurements , Lola boosted the material for a dress from the millinery shop , and Paulita had a seamstress in another cell block make it . A pair of prison shoes was stolen from the wardrobe department and dyed to match the dress . A hat , gloves , and purse appeared , as if by magic . " Now we got ta get you some ID , " Ernestine informed Tracy . " You 'll need a couple a credit cards and a driver 's license . " " How can I ? ? " Ernestine grinned . " You jest leave it to old Ernie Littlechap. "  | The following evening Ernestine handed Tracy three major credit cards in the name of Jane Smith . " Next , you need a driver 's license . " Sometime after midnight Tracy heard the door of her cell being opened . Someone had sneaked into the cell . Tracy sat up in her bunk , instantly on guard . A voice whispered , " Whitney ? Let 's go . " Tracy recognized the voice of Lillian , a trusty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernestine 's voice shot out of the darkness . " What kind of idiot child did your mother raise ? Shut up and do n't ask questions . " Lillian said softly , " We got to do this fast If we get caught , they 'll have my ass . Come on . " " Where are we going ? " Tracy asked , as she followed Lillian down the dark corridor to a stairway . They went up to the landing above and , after making sure there were no guards about , hurried down a hallway until they came to the room where Tracy had been fingerprinted and photographed . Lillian pushed the door open . " In here , " she whispered . Tracy followed her into the room . Another inmate was waiting inside . " Step up against the wall . " She sounded nervous . Tracy moved against the wall , her stomach in knots . " Look into the camera . Come on . Try and look relaxed . " Very funny , Tracy thought . She had never been so nervous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be delivered in the morning , " the inmate said . " It 's for your driver 's license . Now get out of here fast . " Tracy and Lillian retraced their steps . On the way , Lillian said , " I hear you 're changin ' cells . " Tracy froze . " What ? " " Did n't you know ? You 're movin ' in with Big Bertha . " Ernestine , Lola , and Paulita were waiting up for Tracy when she returned . " How 'd it go ? "  | " Fine . " Did n't you know ? You 're movin ' in with Big Bertha . " The dress 'll be ready for you Sattiday , " Paulita said . The day of Ernestine 's release . That 's my deadline , Tracy thought . Ernestine whispered , " Everythin ' is cool . The laundry pickup Sattiday is two o'clock . You got ta be in the utility room by one-thirty . You don ' have to worry about the guard . Lola will keep him busy next door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . She 'll have your clothes . Your ID will be in your purse . You 'll be drivin ' out the prison gates by two-fifteen . " Tracy found it difficult to breathe . Just talking about the escape made her tremble . Nobody gives a shit if they bring you back dead or alive . . . . They figure dead is better . In a few days she would be making her break for freedom . She had no illusions : The odds were against her . They would eventually find her and bring her back . But there was something she had sworn to take care of first . The prison grapevine knew all about the contest that had been fought between Ernestine Littlechap and Big Bertha over Tracy . Now that the word was out that Tracy was being transferred to Big Bertha 's cell , it was no accident that no one had mentioned anything to Big Bertha about Tracy 's escape plan : Big Bertha did not like to hear bad news . She was often apt to confuse the news with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not learn about Tracy 's plan until the morning the escape was to take place , and it was revealed to her by the trusty who had taken Tracy 's picture . Big Bertha took the news in ominous silence . Her body seemed to grow bigger as she listened . " What time ? " was all she asked . " This afternoon at two o'clock , Bert . They 're gon na hide her in the bottom of a laundry hamper in the utility room . " Big Bertha thought about it for a long time . Then she waddled over to a matron and said , " I got ta see Warden Brannigan right away . "  | Tracy had not slept all night . She was sick with tension . The months she had been in prison seemed like a dozen eternities . Images of the past flashed through her mind as she lay on her bunk , staring into the dark . I feel like a princess in a fairy tale , Mother . I did n't know anyone could be this happy . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long a honeymoon are you planning ? You shot me , you bitch ! . . . Your mother committed suicide . . . I never really knew you . . . . The wedding picture of Charles smiling at his bride . How many eons ago ? How many planets away ? The morning bell clanged through the corridor like a shock wave . Tracy sat up on her bunk , wide awake . Ernestine was watching her . " How you feelin ' , girl ? " " Fine , " Tracy lied . Her mouth was dry , and her heart was beating erratically . " Well , we 're both leavin ' here today . " Tracy found it hard to swallow . " Uh-huh . " " You sure you kin get away from the warden 's house by one-thirty ? " " No problem . Amy always takes a nap after lunch . " Paulita said , " You ca n't be late , or it wo n't work . " " I 'll be there . " Ernestine reached under her mattress and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na need some walkin ' around money . It 's only two hundred bucks , but it 'll get you on your way . " " Ernie , I do n't know what to ? " " Oh , jest shut up , girl , and take it . " Tracy forced herself to swallow some breakfast . Her head was pounding , and every muscle in her body ached . I 'll never make it through the day , she thought . I 've got to make it through the day . There was a strained , unnatural silence in the kitchen , and Tracy suddenly realized she was the cause of it . She was the ohiect of knowine looks and nervous whisners . A breakout was  | about to happen , and she was the heroine of the drama . In a few hours she would be free . Or dead . She rose from her unfinished breakfast and headed for Warden Brannigan 's house . As Tracy waited for a guard to unlock the corridor door , she came face-to-face with Big Bertha . The huge Swede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for a big surprise , Tracy thought . She 's all mine now , Big Bertha thought . The morning passed so slowly that Tracy felt she would go out of her mind . The minutes seemed to drag on interminably . She read to Amy and had no idea what she was reading . She was aware of Mrs. Brannigan watching from the window . " Tracy , let 's play hide-and-seek . " Tracy was too nervous to play games , but she dared not do anything to arouse Mrs. Brannigan 's suspicions . She forced a smile . " Sure . Why do n't you hide first , Amy ? " They were in the front yard of the bungalow . In the far distance Tracy could see the building where the utility room was located . She had to be there at exactly 1:30 . She would change into the street clothes that had been made for her , and by 1:45 she would be lying in the bottom of the large clothes hamper , covered over with uniforms and linens . At 2:00 the laundryman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his truck . By 2:15 the truck would drive through the gates on its way to the nearby town where the laundry plant was located . The driver ca n't see in the back of the truck from the front seat . When the truck gets to town and stops for a red light , just open the door , step out , real cool , and catch a bus to wherever you 're goin ' . " Can you see me ? " Amy called . She was half-hidden behind the trunk of a magnolia tree . She held her hand over her mouth to stifle a giggle . I 'll miss her , Tracy thought . When I leave here , the two people I 'll miss will be a black , bald-headed bull-duke and a young girl . She wondered what Charles Stanhope III would have made of that . " I 'm coming to find you , " Tracy said .  | Sue Ellen watched the game from inside the house . It seemed to her that Tracy was acting strangely . All morning she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her mind was obviously not on Amy . I must speak to George about it when he comes home for lunch , Sue Ellen decided . I 'm going to insist that he replace her . In the yard , Tracy and Amy played hopscotch for a while , then jacks , and Tracy read to Amy , and finally , blessedly , it was twelve-thirty , time for Amy 's lunch . Time for Tracy to make her move . She took Amy into the cottage . " I 'll be leaving now , Mrs. Brannigan . " " What ? Oh . Did n't anyone tell you , Tracy ? We 're having a delegation of VIP visitors today . They 'll be having lunch here at the house , so Amy wo n't be having her nap . You may take her with you . " Tracy stood there , willing herself not to scream . " I  --  I ca n't do that , Mrs. Brannigan . " Sue Ellen Brannigan stiffened . " What do you mean you ca n't do that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I must n't upset her . She 'll call the warden , and I 'll be sent back to my cell . Tracy forced a smile . " I mean . . . Amy has n't had her lunch . She 'll be hungry . " " I 've had the cook prepare a picnic lunch for both of you . You can go for a nice walk in the meadow and have it there . Amy enjoys picnics , do n't you , darling ? " " I love picnics . " She looked at Tracy pleadingly . " Can we , Tracy ? Can we ? " No ! Yes . Careful . It could still work . Be in the utility room by one-thirty . Do n't be late . Tracy looked at Mrs. Brannigan . " What  --  what time do you want me to bring Amy back ? " " Oh , about three o'clock . They should be gone by then . " So - Mould the truck . The world was tumbling in on her . " I ? " Are you all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would want to check her over and keep her there . She would never be able to get out in time . There had to be some other way . Mrs. Brannigan was staring at her . " I 'm fine . " There 's something wrong with her , Sue Ellen Brannigan decided . I 'm definitely going to have George get someone else . Amy 's eyes were alight with joy . " I 'll give you the biggest sandwiches , Tracy . We 'll have a good time , wo n't we ? " Tracy had no answer . The VIP tour was a surprise visit . Governor William Haber himself was escorting the prison reform committee through the penitentiary . It was something that Warden Brannigan had to live with once a year . " It goes with the territory , George , " the governor had explained . " Just clean up the place , tell your ladies to smile pretty , and we 'll get our budget increased again . " The word had gone out from the chief guard that morning : " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Governor Haber and his party were due to arrive at 10:00 A.M. They would inspect the interior of the penitentiary first , visit the farm , and then have lunch with the warden at his cottage . Big Bertha was impatient . When she had put in a request to see the warden , she had been told , " The warden is very pressed for time this morning . Tomorrow would be easier . He ? " " Fuck tomorrow ! " Big Bertha had exploded . " I want to see him now . It 's important . " There were few inmates in the prison who could have gotten away with it , but Big Bertha was one of them . The prison authorities were well aware of her power . They had seen her start riots , and they had seen her stop them . No prison in the world could be run without the cooperation of the inmate leaders , and Big Bertha was a leader . She had been seated in the warden 's outer office for almost an hour , her huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disgusting-looking creature , the warden 's secretary thought . She gives me the Creeps .  | " How much longer ? " Big Bertha demanded . " It should n't be too much longer . He has a group of people in with him . The warden 's very busy this morning . " Big Bertha said , " He 's gon na be busier . " She looked at her watch . Twelve-forty-five . Plenty of time . It was a perfect day , cloudless and warm , and the singing breeze carried a tantalizing mixture of scents across the green farmland . Tracy had spread out a tablecloth on a grassy area near the lake , and Amy was happily munching on an egg salad sandwich . Tracy glanced at her watch . It was already 1:00 . She could not believe it . The morning had dragged and the afternoon was winging by . She had to think of something quickly , or time was going to steal away her last chance at freedom . One-ten . In the warden 's reception office Warden Brannigan 's secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry . The warden says it 's impossible for him to see you today . We 'll make another appointment for ? " Big Bertha pushed herself to her feet . " He 's got to see me ! It 's ? " " We 'll fit you in tomorrow . " Big Bertha started to say , " Tomorrow will be too late , " but she stopped herself in time . No one but the warden himself must know what she was doing . Snitches suffered fatal accidents . But she had no intention of giving up . There was no way she was going to let Tracy Whitney get away from her . She walked into the prison library and sat down at one of the long tables at the far end of the room . She scribbled a note , and when the matron walked over to an aisle to help an innnate , Big Bertha dropped the note on her desk and left . When the matron returned , she found the note and opened it . She read it twice : YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no signature . A hoax ? The matron had no way of knowing . She picked up the telephone . " Get me the superintendent of guards . . . . "  | One-fifteen . " You 're not eating , " Amy said . " You want some of my sandwich ? " " No ! Leave me alone . " She had not meant to speak so harshly . Amy stopped eating . " Are you mad at me , Tracy ? Please do n't be mad at me . I love you so much . I never get mad at you . " Her soft eyes were filled with hurt . " I 'm not angry . " She was in hell . " I 'm not hungry if you 're not . Let 's play ball , Tracy . " And Amy pulled her rubber ball out of her pocket . One-sixteen . She should have been on her way . It would take her at least fifteen minutes to get to the utility room . She could just make it if she hurried . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the far distance she saw a group of trusties picking crops . Instantly , Tracy knew what she was going to do . " Do n't you want to play ball , Tracy ? " Tracy rose to her feet . " Yes . Let 's play a new game . Let 's see who can throw the ball the farthest . I 'll throw the ball , and then it will be your turn . " Tracy picked up the hard rubber ball and threw it as far as she could in the direction of the workers . " Oh , that 's good , " Amy said admiringly . " That 's real far . " " I 'll go get the ball , " Tracy said . " You wait here . " And she was running , running for her life , her feet flying across the fields . It was 1:18 . If she was late , they would wait for her . Or would they ? She ran faster . Behind her , she heard Amy calling , but she paid no attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Tracy yelled at them , and they stopped . She was breathless when she reached them . " Anythin ' wrong ? " one of them asked . " No , n-nothing . " She was panting , fighting for breath . " The little girl back there . One of you look after her . I have something important I have to do . I ? " She heard her name called from a distance and turned . Amy was standing on top of the concrete wall surrounding the lake . She waved . " Look at me , Tracy . " " No ! ( , et down ! " Tracy screamed .  | And as Tracy watched in horror , Amy lost her balance and plunged into the lake . " Oh , dear God ! " The blood drained from Tracy 's face . She had a choice to make , but there was no choice . I ca n't help her . Not now . Someone will save her . I have to save myself . I 've got to get out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracy turned and began running as fast as she had ever run in her life . The others were calling after her , but she did not hear them . She flew through the air , unaware that her shoes had fallen off , not caring that the sharp ground was cutting into her feet . Her heart was pounding , and her lungs were bursting , and she pushed herself to run faster , faster . She reached the wall around the lake and vaulted on top of it . Far below , she could see Amy in the deep , terrifying water , struggling to stay afloat . Without a second 's hesitation , Tracy jumped in after her . And as she hit the water , Tracy thought , Oh , my God ! I ca n't swim . . . .  | New Orleans FRIDAY , AUGUST 25 ? 10:00 A.M. Lester Torrance , a teller at the First Merchants Bank Orleans , prided himself on two things : his sexual prow ( the ladies and his ability to size up his customers . Les in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T leck mustache and long sideburns . He had been pass for promotion twice , and in retaliation , Lester used tt as a personal dating service . He could spot hookers away , and he enjoyed trying to persuade them to give h favors for nothing . Lonely widows were an especial prey . They came in all shapes , ages , and states of d Lion , and sooner or later they would appear in front ter 's cage . If they were temporarily overdrawn , Lester lend a sympathetic ear and delay bouncing their check ! turn , perhaps they could have a quiet little dinner to Many of his female customers sought his help and c delicious secrets to him : They needed a loan withoi  | husbands ' knowledge . . . . They wanted to keep confidential certain checks they had written . . . . They were contemplating a divorce , and could Lester help them close out their joint account right away ? . . . Lester was only too eager to please . And to be pleased . On this particular Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw the woman the moment she walked in the door of the bank . She was an absolute stunner . She had sleek black hair falling to her shoulders , and she wore a tight skirt and sweater that outlined a figure a Las Vegas chorine would have envied . There were four other tellers in the bank , and the young woman 's eyes went from one cage to the other , as though seeking help . When she glanced at Lester , he nodded eagerly and gave her an encouraging smile . She walked over to his cage , just as Lester had known she would . " Good morning , " Lester said warmly . " What may I do for you ? " He could see her nipples pushing against her cashmere sweater , and he thought , Baby , what I 'd like to do for you ! " I 'm afraid I have a problem , " the woman said softly . She had the most delightful southern accent Lester had ever heard . " That 's what I 'm here for , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I do hope so . I 'm afraid I 've done somethin ' just terrible . " Lester gave her his best paternal , you-can-lean-on-me smile . " I ca n't believe a lovely lady like you could do anything terrible . " " Oh , but I have . " Her soft brown eyes were wide with panic . " I 'm Joseph Romano 's secretary , and he told me to order new blank checks for his checking account a week ago , and I simply forgot all about it , and now we 've just about run out , and when he finds out , I do n't know what he 'll do to me . " It came out in a soft , velvety rush . Lester was only too familiar with the name of Joseph Romano . He was a prized customer of the hank 's , even though he kept relatively small amounts in his account . Everyone knew that his real money was laundered elsewhere . Ile sure has great taste in secretaries . I.rxtrr th , . uoht No  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too serious , Mrs. ? ? " " Miss . Hartford . Lureen Hartford . " Miss . This was his lucky day . Lester sensed that this was going to work out splendidly . " I 'll just order those new checks tor you right now . You should have them in two or three weeks and ? " She gave a little moan , a sound that seemed to Lester to hold infinite promise . " Oh , that 's too late , and Mr. Romano 's already so upset with me . I just ca n't seem to keep my mind on my work , you know ? " She leaned forward so that her breasts were touching the front of the cage . She said breathlessly , " If you could just rush those checks out , I 'd be happy to pay extra . " Lester said ruefully , " Gee , I 'm sorry , Lureen , it would be impossible to ? " He saw that she was near to tears . " To tell you the truth , this might cost me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " The words fell like music on Lester 's ears . " I 'll tell you what I 'll do , " Lester declared . " I 'll phone in a special rush on them , and you 'll have them Monday . How 's that ? " " Oh , you 're just wonderful ! " Her voice was filled with gratitude . " I 'll send them to the office and ? " " It would be better if I picked them up myself . I do n't want Mr. Romano to know how stupid I was . " Lester smiled indulgently . " Not stupid , Lureen . We all get a little forgetful sometimes . " She said softly , " I 'll never forget you . See you Monday . " " I 'll be here . " It would take a broken back to keep him home . She gave him a dazzling smile and walked slowly out of the bank , and her walk was a sight to behold . Lester was grinning as he went over to a file cabinet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phoned in a rush order for the new checks . The hotel on Carmen Street was indistinguishable from a hi , n , tri . rather hotels in New Orleans . which was why Tracy  | had chosen it . She had been in the small , cheaply furnished room for a week . Compared to her cell , it was a palace . When Tracy returned from her encounter with Lester , she took off the black wig , ran her fingers through her own luxuriant hair , removed the soft contact lenses , and creamed off her dark makeup . She sat down on the single straight chair in the room and breathed deeply . It was going well . It had been easy to learn where Joe Romano kept his bank account . Tracy had looked up the canceled check from her mother 's estate , issued by Romano . " Joe Romano ? You ca n't touch him , " Ernestine had said . Ernestine was wrong and Joe Romano was just the first . The others would follow . Every one of them . She closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . . . . She felt the cold , dark waters closing over her head . She was drowning , and she was filled with terror . She dived down , and her hands found the child and grabbed her and pulled her to the surface . Amy struggled in blind panic to break free , dragging them both under again , her arms and legs flailing wildly . Tracy 's lungs were bursting . She fought her way out of the watery grave , hanging on to the little girl in a death grip , and she felt her strength ebbing . We 're not going to make it , she thought . We 're dying . Voices were calling out , and she felt Amy 's body torn from her arms and she screamed , " Oh , God , no ! " Strong hands were around Tracy 's waist and a voice said , " Everything 's fine now . Take it easy . It 's over . " Tracy looked around frantically for Amy and saw that she was safe in a man 's arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cruel water . . . . The incident would have been worth no more than a paragraph on the inside page of the morning newspapers , except for the fact that a prisoner who could not swim had risked her life to save the child of the warden . Overnight the newspapers and television commentators turned Tracy into a heroine . Governor Haber himself visited the prison hospital with Warden Brannigan to see Tracy . " That was a very brave thins von did " the w : r , i , ? n ? .  | " Mrs. Brannigan and I want you to know how grateful we are . " His voice was choked with emotion . Tracy was still weak and shaken from her experience . " How is Amy ? " " She 's going to be fine . " Tracy closed her eyes . I could n't have borne it if anything had happened to her , she thought . She remembered her coldness , when all the child had wanted was love , and Tracy felt bitterly ashamed . The incident had cost her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had it to do over again , she would do the same thing . There was a brief inquiry into the accident . " It was my fault , " Amy told her father . " We were playing ball , and Tracy ran after the ball and told me to wait , but I climbed up on the wall so I could see her better and I fell in the water . But Tracy saved me , Daddy . " They kept Tracy in the hospital that night for observation , and the next morning she was taken to Warden Brannigan 's office . The media was waiting for her . They knew a humaninterest story when they saw one , and stringers from UPI and the Associated Press were present ; the local television station had sent a news team . That evening the report of Tracy 's heroism unfolded , and the account of the rescue went on national television and began to snowball . Time , Newsweek , People , and hundreds of newspapers all over the country carried the story . As the press coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding that Tracy Whitney be pardoned . Governor Haber discussed it with Warden Brannigan . " Tracy Whitney is in here for some serious crimes , " Warden Brannigan observed . The governor was thoughtful . " But she has no previous record , right , George ? " " That 's right , sir . " " I do n't mind telling you , I 'm getting a hell of a lot of pressure to do something about her . " " So am I , Governor . " " Of course , we ca n't let the public tell us how to run our nricnnc can we ? "  | " Certainly not . " " On the other hand , " the governor said judiciously , " the Whitney girl has certainly demonstrated a remarkable amount of courage . She 's become quite a heroine . " " No question about it , " Warden Brannigan agreed . The governor paused to light a cigar . " What 's your opinion , George ? " George Brannigan chose his words carefully . " You 're aware , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in this . It was my child she saved . But , putting that aside , I do n't think Tracy Whitney is the criminal type , and I ca n't believe she would be a danger to society if she were out in the world . My strong recommendation is that you give her a pardon . " The governor , who was about to announce his candidacy for a new term , recognized a good idea when he heard it . " Let 's play this close to the chest for a bit . " In politics , timing was everything . After discussing it with her husband , Sue Ellen said to Tracy , " Warden Brannigan and I would like it very much if you moved into the cottage . We have a spare bedroom in back . You could take care of Amy full-time . " " Thank you , " Tracy said gratefully . " I would like that . " It worked out perfectly . Not only did Tracy not have to spend each night locked away in a cell , but her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tracy responded . She enjoyed being with this bright , loving little girl . They played their old games and watched Disney movies on television and read together . It was almost like being part of a family . But whenever Tracy had an errand that took her into the cell blocks , she invariably ran into Big Bertha . " You 're a lucky bitch , " Big Bertha growled . " But you 'll be back here with the common folks one day soon . I 'm workin ' on it , littbarn . " Three weeks after Amy 's rescue Tracy and Amy were playing tag in the yard when Sue Ellen Brannigan hurried out of  | the house . She stood there a moment watching them . " Tracy , the warden just telephoned . He would like to see you in his office right away . " Tracy was filled with a sudden fear . Did it mean that she was going to be transferred back to the prison ? Had Big Bertha used her influence to arrange it . Or had Mrs. Brannigan decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Mrs. Brannigan . " The warden was standing in the doorway of his office when Tracy was escorted in . " You 'd better sit down , " he said . Tracy tried to read the answer to her fate from the tone of his voice . " I have some news for you . " He paused , filled with some emotion that Tracy did not understand . " I have just received an order from the governor of Louisiana , " Warden Brannigan went on , " giving you a full pardon , effective immediately . " Dear God , did he say what I think he said ? She was afraid to speak . " I want you to know , " the warden continued , " that this is not being done because it was my child you saved . You acted instinctively in the way any decent citizen would have acted . By no stretch of the imagination could I ever believe that you would be a threat to society . " He smiled and added , " Amy is going to miss you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the warden only knew the truth : that if the accident had not happened , the warden 's men would have been out hunting her as a fugitive . " You 'll be released the day after tomorrow . " Her " getup . " And still Tracy could not absorb it . " I  --  I do n't know what to say . " " You do n't have to say anything . Everyone here is very proud of you . Mrs. Brannigan and I expect you to do great things on the outside . " So it was true : She was free . Tracy felt so weak that she had to steady herself against the arm of the chair . When she finally spoke , her voice was firm . " There 's a lot I want to do , Warden Brannigan. " * * *  | On Tracy 's last day in prison an inmate from Tracy 's old cell block walked up to her . " So you 're getting out . " " That 's right . " The woman , Betty Franciscus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an air of pride about her . " If you need any help on the outside , there 's a man you should see in New York . His name is Conrad Morgan . " She slipped Tracy a piece of paper . " He 's into criminal reform . He likes to give a hand to people who 've been in prison . " " Thank you , but I do n't think I 'll need ? " " You never know . Keep his address . " Two hours later , Tracy was walking through the penitentiary gates , moving past the television cameras . She would not speak to the reporters , but when Amy broke away from her mother and threw herself into Tracy 's arms , the cameras whirred . That was the picture that came out over the evening news . Freedom to Tracy was no longer simply an abstract word . It was something tangible , physical , a condition to be enjoyed and savored . Freedom meant breathing fresh air , privacy , not standing in lines for meals , not listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft lingerie , pretty dresses , and high-heeled shoes . It meant having a name instead of a number . Freedom meant escape from Big Bertha and fear of gang rapes and the deadly monotony of prison routine . Tracy 's newfound freedom took getting used to . Walking along a street , she was careful not to jostle anyone . In the penitentiary bumping into another prisoner could be the spark that set off a conflagration . It was the absence of constant menace that Tracy found most difficult to adjust to . No one was threatening her . She was free to carry out her plans . In Philadelphia , Charles Stanhope III saw Tracy on television , leaving the prison . She 's still beautiful , he thought . Watching her , it seemed impossible that she had committed any of the crimes for which she had been convicted . I le looked at his exemplary wife , placidly seated across the room , knitting . 1  --  ' oncler if I ' nude a mistake .  | Daniel Cooper watched Tracy on the television news in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that she had been released from prison . He clicked off the television set and returned to the file he was working on . When Joe Romano saw the television news , he laughed aloud . The Whitney girl was a lucky bitch . I 'll bet prison was good for her . She must be really horny by now . Maybe one day we 'll meet again . Romano was pleased with himself . He had already passed the Renoir to a fence , and it had been purchased by a private collector in Zurich . Five hundred grand from the insurance company , and another two hundred thousand from the fence . Naturally , Romano had split the money with Anthony Orsatti . Romano was very meticulous in his dealings with him , for he had seen examples of what happened to people who were not correct in their transactions with Orsatti . At noon on Monday Tracy , in her Lureen Hartford persona , returned to the First Merchants Bank of New Orleans . At that hour it was crowded with customers . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracy joined the line , and when Lester saw her , he beamed and nodded . She was even more goddamned beautiful than he had remembered . When Tracy finally reached his window , Lester crowed , " Well , it was n't easy , but I did it for you , Lureen . " A warm , appreciative smile lit Lureen 's face . " You 're just too wonderful . " " Yes , sir , got ' em right here . " Lester opened a drawer , found the box of checks he had carefully put away , and handed it to her . " There you are . Four hundred blank checks . Will that be enough ? " " Oh , more than enough , unless Mr. Romano goes on a check-writing spree . " She looked into Lester 's eyes and sighed , " You saved my life . " Lester felt a pleasurable stirring in his groin . " I believe neonle have to be nice to people , do n't you , Lureen ? "  | " You 're so right , Lester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own account here . I 'd take real good care of you . Real good . " " I just know you would , " Tracy said softly . " Why do n't you and me talk about it over a nice quiet dinner somewhere ? " " I 'd surely love that . " " Where can I call you , Lureen ? " " Oh , I 'll call you , Lester . " She moved away . " Wait a min ? " The next customer stepped up and handed the frustrated Lester a sackful of coins . In the center of the bank were four tables that held containers of blank deposit and withdrawal slips , and the tables were crowded with people busily filling out forms . Tracy moved away from Lester 's view . As a customer made room at a table , Tracy took her place . The box that Lester had given her contained eight packets of blank checks . But it was not the checks Tracy was interested in : It was the deposit slips at the back of the packets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fewer than three minutes , she was holding eighty deposit slips in her hand . Making sure she was unobserved , Tracy put twenty of the slips in the metal container . She moved on to the next table , where she placed twenty more deposit slips . Within a few minutes , all of them had been left on the various tables . The deposit slips were blank , but each one contained a magnetized code at the bottom , which the computer used to credit the various accounts . No matter who deposited money , because of the magnetic code , the computer would automatically credit Joe Romano 's account with each deposit . From her experience working in a bank , Tracy knew that within two days all the magnetized deposit slips would be used up and that it would take at least five days before the mix-up was noticed . That would give her more than enough time for what she planned to do . On the way back to her hotel , Tracy threw the blank checks into a trash basket . Mr. Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop was at the New Orleans Holiday Travel  | Agency . The young woman behind the desk asked , " May I help you ? " " I 'm Joseph Romano 's secretary . Mr. Romano would like to make a reservation for Rio de Janeiro . He wants to leave this Friday . " " Will that be one ticket ? " " Yes . First class . An aisle seat . Smoking , please . " " Round trip ? " " One way . " The travel agent turned to her desk computer . In a few seconds , she said , " We 're all set . One first-class seat on Pan American 's Flight seven twenty-eight , leaving at six-thirty-five P.M. on Friday , with a short stopover in Miami . " " He 'll be very pleased , " Tracy assured the woman . " That will be nineteen hundred twenty-nine dollars . Will that be cash or charge ? " " Mr. Romano always pays cash . COD . Could you have the ticket delivered to his office on Thursday , please ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " " No . Mr. Romano wo n't be there tomorrow . Would you make it Thursday at eleven A.M. ? " " Yes . That will be fine . And the address ? " " Mr. Joseph Romano , Two-seventeen Poydras Street , Suite four-zero-eight . " The woman made a note of it . " Very well . I 'll see that it 's delivered Thursday morning . " " Eleven sharp , " Tracy said . " Thank you . " Half a block down the street was the Acme Luggage Store . Tracy studied the display in the window before she walked inside . A clerk approached her . " Good morning . And what can I do for you this morning ? " " I want to buy some luggage for my husband . " " You 've come to the right place . We 're having a sale . We have some nice , inexpensive ? " " No , " Tracy said . " Nothing inexpensive . " She stepped over to a display of Vuitton suitcases stacked against a wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're going away on a trip . "  | " Well , I 'm sure he 'll be pleased with one of these . We have three different sizes . Which one would ? ? " " I 'll take one of each . " " Oh . Fine . Will that be charge or cash ? " " COD . The name is Joseph Romano . Could you have them delivered to my husband 's office on Thursday morning ? " " Why , certainly , Mrs. Romano . " " At eleven o'clock ? " " I 'll see to it personally . " As an afterthought , Tracy added , " Oh . . . would you put his initials on them  --  in gold ? That 's J.R . " " Of course . It will be our pleasure , Mrs. Romano . " Tracy smiled and gave him the office address . At a nearby Western Union office , Tracy sent a paid cable to the Rio Othon Palace on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro . It read : REQUEST YOUR BEST SUITE COMMENCING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CABLE . JOSEPH ROMANO , 2I7 POYDRAS STREET , SUITE 408 , NEW ORLEANS , LOUISIANA , USA . Three days later Tracy telephoned the bank and asked to speak to Lester Torrance . When she heard his voice , she said softly , " You probably do n't remember me , Lester , but this is Lureen Hartford , Mr. Romano 's secretary , and ? " Not remember her ! His voice was eager . " Of course I remember you , Lureen . I ? " " You do ? Why , I 'm flattered . You must meet so many people . " " Not like you , " Lester assured her . " You have n't forgotten about our dinner date , have you ? " " You do n't know how much I 'm lookin ' forward to it . Would next Tuesday suit you , Lester ? " " Great ! " " Then it 's a date . Oh . I 'm such an idiot ! You got me so excited talkin ' to you I almost forgot why I called . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you give me that figure ? " " You bet . No trouble at all . " Ordinarily . Lester Torrance would have asked for a birth date  | or some form of identification from the caller , but in this case it was certainly not necessary . No , sir . " Hang on , Lureen , " he said . He walked over to the file , pulled out Joseph 's Romano 's sheet , and studied it in surprise . There had been an extraordinary number of deposits made to Romano 's account in the past several days . Romano had never kept so much money in his account before . Lester Torrance wondered what was going on . Some big deal , obviously . When he had dinner with Lureen Hartford , he intended to pump her . A little inside information never hurt . He returned to the phone . " Your boss has been keeping us busy , " he told Tracy . " He has just over three hundred thousand dollars in his checking account . " " Oh , good . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like us to transfer it to a money market account ? It 's not drawing any interest sitting here , and I could ? " " No . He wants it right where it is , " Tracy assured him . " Okay . " " Thank you so much , Lester . You 're a darlin ' . " " Wait a minute ! Should I call you at the office about the arrangements for Tuesday ? " " I 'll call you , honey , " Tracy told him . And the connection was broken . The modern high-rise office building owned by Anthony Orsatti stood on Poydras Street between the riverfront and the gigantic Louisiana Superdome , and the offices of the Pacific Import-Export Company occupied the entire fourth floor of the building . At one end of the suite were Orsatti 's offices , and at the other end , Joe Romano 's rooms . The space in between was occupied by four young receptionists who were available evenings to entertain Anthony Orsatti 's friends and business acquaintances . In front of Orsatti 's suite sat two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss . They also served as chauffeurs , masseurs , and errand boys for the capo . On this Thursday morning Orsatti was in his office checking out the previous day 's receipts from running numbers , book-  | making , prostitution , and a dozen other lucrative activities that the Pacific Import-Export Company controlled . Anthony Orsatti was in his late sixties . He was a strangely built man , with a large , heavy torso and short , bony legs that seemed to have been designed for a smaller man . Standing up he looked like a seated frog . He had a face crisscrossed with an erratic web of scars that could have been woven by a drunken spider , an oversized mouth , and black , bulbous eyes . He had been totally bald from the age of fifteen after an attack of alopecia , and had worn a black wig ever since . It fitted him badly , but in all the years no one had dared mention it to his face . Orsatti 's cold eyes were gambler 's eyes , giving away nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five daughters , whom he adored , was expressionless . The only clue to Orsatti 's emotions was his voice . He had a hoarse , raspy voice , the result of a wire having been tightened around his throat on his twenty-first birthday , when he had been left for dead . The two men who had made that mistake had turned up in the morgue the following week . When Orsatti got really upset , his voice lowered to a strangled whisper that could barely be heard . Anthony Orsatti was a king who ran his fiefdom with bribes , guns , and blackmail . He ruled New Orleans , and it paid him obeisance in the form of untold riches . The capos of the other Families across the country respected him and constantly sought his advice . At the moment , Anthony Orsatti was in a benevolent mood . He had had breakfast with his mistress , whom he kept in an apartment building he owned in Lake Vista . He visited her three times a week , and this morning 's visit had been particularly satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women never dreamed of , and Orsatti sincerely believed it was because she loved him so much . His organization was running smoothly . There were no problems , because Anthony Orsatti knew how to solve difficulties before they became problems . He had once explained his philosophy to Joe Romano : " Never let a little problem become a big problem , Joe , or it grows like a fuckin ' snowball . You got a precinct captain who thinks he  | ought a get a bigger cut  --  you melt him , see ? No more snowball . You get some hotshot from Chicago who asks permission to open up his own little operation here in New Orleans ? You know that pretty soon that little ' operation is gon na turn into a big operation and start cuttin ' into your profits . So you say yes , and then when he gets here , you melt the son of a bitch . No more snowball . Get the picture ? " Joe Romano got the picture . Anthony Orsatti loved Romano . He was like a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a punk kid rolling drunks in alleys . He himself had trained Romano , and now the kid could tap-dance his way around with the best of them . He was fast , he was smart , and he was honest . In ten years Romano had risen to the rank of Anthony Orsatti 's chief lieutenant . He supervised all the Family 's operations and reported only to Orsatti . Lucy , Orsatti 's private secretary , knocked and came into the office . She was twenty-four years old , a college graduate , with a face and figure that had won several local beauty contests . Orsatti enjoyed having beautiful young women around him . He looked at the clock on his desk . It was 10:45 . He had told Lucy he did not want any interruptions before noon . He scowled at her . " What ? " " I 'm sorry to bother you , Mr. Orsatti . There 's a Miss Gigi Dupres on the phone . She sounds hysterical , but she wo n't tell me what she wants . She insists on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . " Orsatti sat there , running the name through the computer in his brain . Gigi Dupres ? One of the broads he had up in his suite his last time in Vegas ? Gigi Dupres ? Not that he could remember , and he prided himself on a mind that forgot nothing . Out of curiosity , Orsatti picked up the phone and waved a dismissal at Lucy . " Yeah ? Who 's this ? " " Is thees Mr. Anthony Orsatti ? " She had a French accent . " So ? " " Oh , thank God I get hold of you , Meester Orsatti ! " Lucy was right . The dame was hysterical . Anthony Orsatti  | was not interested . He started to hang up , when her voice went on . " You must stop him , please ! " " Lady , I do n't know who you 're talkin ' about , and I 'm a busy ? " " My Joe . Joe Romano . He promised to take me with him , comprenez vous ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up with him . I ai n't his nursemaid . " " He lie to me ! I just found out he is leave for Brazil without me . Half of that three hundred thousand dollars is mine . " Anthony Orsatti suddenly found he was interested , after all . " What three hundred thousand you talkin ' about ? " " The money Joe is hiding in his checking account . The money he  --  how you say ? ? skimmed . " Anthony Orsatti was very interested . " Please tell Joe he must take me to Brazil with him . Please ! Weel you do thees ? " " Yeah , " Anthony Orsatti promised . " I 'll take care of it . " Joe Romano 's office was modern , all white and chrome , done by one of New Orleans 's most fashionable decorators . The only touches of color were the three expensive French Impressionist paintings on the walls . Romano prided himself on his good taste . He had fought his way up from the slums of New Orleans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye for paintings and an ear for music . When he dined out , he had long , knowledgeable discussions with the sommelier about wines . Yes , Joe Romano had every reason to be proud . While his contemporaries had survived by using their fists , he had succeeded by using his brains . If it was true that Anthony Orsatti owned New Orleans , it was also true that it was Joe Romano who ran it for him . His secretary walked into his office . " Mr. Romano , there 's a messenger here with an airplane ticket for Rio de Janeiro . Shall I write out a check ? It 's COI ) . " " Rio de Janeiro ? " Romano shook his head . " Tell him there 's some mistake . "  | The uniformed messenger was in the doorway . " I was told to deliver this to Joseph Romano at this address . " " Well , you were told wrong . What is this , some kind of a new airline promotion gimmick ? " " No , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romano took the ticket from the messenger 's hand and looked at it . " Friday . Why would I be going to Rio on Friday ? " " That 's a good question , " Anthony Orsatti said . He was standing behind the messenger . " Why would you , Joe ? " " It 's some kind of dumb mistake , Tony . " Romano handed the ticket back to the messenger . " Take this back where it came from and ? " " Not so fast . " Anthony Orsatti took the ticket and examined it . " It says here one first-class ticket , aisle seat , smoking , to Rio de Janeiro for Friday . One way . " Joe Romano laughed . " Someone made a mistake . " He turned to his secretary . " Madge , call the travel agency and tell them they goofed . Some poor slob is going to be missing his plane ticket . " Joleen , the assistant secretary , walked in . " Excuse me , Mr. Romano . The luggage has arrived . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romano stared at her . " What luggage ? I did n't order any luggage . " " Have them bring it in , " Anthony Orsatti commanded . " Jesus ! " Joe Romano said . " Has everyone gone nuts ? " A messenger walked in carrying three Vuitton suitcases . " What 's all this ? I never ordered those . " The messenger checked his delivery slip . " It says Mr. Joseph Romano , Two-seventeen Poydras Street , Suite four-zero-eight ? " Joe Romano was losing his temper . " I do n't care what the fuck it says . I did n't order them . Now get them out of here . " Orsatti was examining the luggage . " They have your initials on them , Joe . " " What ? Oh . Wait a minute ! It 's probably some kind of present . "  | " Is it your birthday ? " " No . But you know how broads are , Tony . They 're always givin ' you gifts . " " Have you got somethin ' going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joe Romano laughed . " This must be someone 's idea of a joke , Tony . " Orsatti smiled gently , then turned to the secretaries and the two messengers . " Out . " When the door was closed behind them , Anthony Orsatti spoke . " How much money you got in your bank account , Joe ? " Joe Romano looked at him , puzzled . " I do n't know . Fifteen hundred , I guess , maybe a couple of grand . Why ? " " Just for fun , why do n't you call your bank and check it out ? " " What for ? I ? " " Check it out , Joe . " " Sure . If it 'll make you happy . " He buzzed his secretary .

My birth date is October fourteenth . " Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later the bookkeeper was back on the line . " Sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. Romano .

" It 's what ? " " Three hundred ten thousand nine hundred five ? " " You stupid bitch ! " he yelled . " I do n't have that kind of money in my account . You made a mistake . Let me talk to the ? " He felt the telephone being taken out of his hand , as Anthony ( ) rsatti replaced the receiver . " Where 'd that money come from , Joe ' ? "  | Joe Romano 's face was pale . " I swear to God , Tony , I do n't know anything about that money . " " No ? " " Hey , you 've got to believe me ! You know what 's happening ? Someone is setting me up . " " It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a going-away present of three hundred ten thousand dollars . " Orsatti sat down heavily on the Scalamander silk-covered armchair and looked at Joe Romano for a long moment , then spoke very quietly . " Everything was all set , huh ? A one-way ticket to Rio , new luggage . . . Like you was planning a whole new life . " " No ! " There was panic in Joe Romano 's voice . " Jesus , you know me better than that , Tony . I 've always been on the level with you . You 're like a father to me . " He was sweating now . There was a knock at the door , and Madge poked her head in . She held an envelope . " I 'm sorry to interrupt , Mr. Romano . There 's a cable for you , but you have to sign for it yourself . " With the instincts of a trapped animal , Joe Romano said , " Not now . I 'm busy . " " I 'll take it , " Anthony Orsatti said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman could close the door . He took his time reading the cable , then he focused his eyes on Joe Romano . In a voice so low that Romano could barely hear him , Anthony Orsatti said , " I 'll read it to you , Joe .

Montalband , manager , Rio Othon Palace , Copacabana Beach , Rio de Janeiro . ' It 's your reservation , Joe . You wo n't be needin ' it , will you ? "  | Andre Gillian was in the kitchen making preparations for spaghetti alla carbonara , a large Italian salad , and a pear torte when he heard a loud , ominous popping sound , and a moment later the comfortable hum of the central air conditioner trailed off into silence . Andre stamped his foot and said , " Merde ! Not the night of the game . " He hurried to the utility closet where the breaker box was located and flicked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Mr. Pope was going to be furious . Simply furious ! Andre knew how much his employer looked forward to his weekly Friday-night poker game . It was a tradition that had been going on for years , and it was always with the same elite group of players . Without air-conditioning , the house would be unbearable . Simply unbearable ! New Orleans in September was only for the uncivilized . Even after the sun went down , there was no relief from the heat and humidity . Andre returned to the kitchen and consulted the kitchen clock . Four o'clock . The guests would be arriving at 8:00.  | Andre thought about telephoning Mr. Pope and telling him the problem , but then he remembered that the lawyer had said he was going to be tied up in court all day . The dear man was so busy . He needed his relaxation . And now this ! Andre took a small black telephone book from a kitchen drawer , looked up a number , and dialed . After three rings , a metallic voice intoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicians are not available at this time . If you will leave your name and number and a brief message , we will get back to you as soon as possible . Please wait for the beep . " Foutre ! Only in America were you forced to hold a conversation with a machine . A shrill , annoying beep sounded in Andre 's ear . He spoke into the mouthpiece : " This is the residence of Monsieur Perry Pope , Forty-two Charles Street . Our air-conditioning has ceased to function . You must send someone here as quickly as possible . Vite ! " He slammed down the receiver . Of course no one was available . Air-conditioning was probably going off all over this dreadful city . It was impossible for air conditioners to cope with the damnable heat and humidity . Well , someone had better come soon . Mr. Pope had a temper . A nasty temper . In the three years Andre Gillian had worked as a cook for the attorney , he had learned how influential his employer was . It was amazing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew simply everybody . When he snapped his fingers , people jumped . It seemed to Andre Gillian that the house was already feeling warmer . Ca va chier dur . If something is not done quickly , the shit 's going to hit the fan . As Andre went back to cutting paper-thin slices of salami and provolone cheese for the salad , he could not shake the terrible feeling that the evening was fated to be a disaster . When the doorbell rang thirty minutes later , Andre 's clothes were soaked with perspiration , and the kitchen was like an oven . Gillian hurried to open the back door . Two workmen in overalls stood in the doorway , carrying toolboxes . One of them was a tall black man . His companion  | was white , several inches shorter , with a sleepy , bored look on his face . In the rear driveway stood their service truck . " Got ta problem with your air-conditioning ? " the black man asked . " Oui ! Thank heaven you 're here . You 've just got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving soon . " The black man walked over to the oven , sniffed the baking torte , and said , " Smells good . " " Please ! " Gillian urged . " Do something ! " " Let 's take a look in the furnace room , " the short man said . " Where is it ? " " This way . " Andre hurried them down a corridor to a utility room , where the air-conditioning unit stood . " This is a good unit , Ralph , " the black man said to his companion . " Yeah , Al . They do n't make ' em like this anymore . " " Then for heaven 's sake why is n't it working ? " Gillian demanded . They both turned to stare at him . " We just got here , " Ralph said reprovingly . He knelt down and opened a small door at the bottom of the unit , took out a flashlight , got down on his stomach , and peered inside . After a moment , he rose to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is it , then ? " Andre asked . " Must be a short in one of the outlets . Probably shorted out the whole system . How many air-conditioning vents do you have ? " " Each room has one . Let 's see . That must be at least nine . " " That 's probably the problem . Transduction overload . Let 's go take a look . " The three of them trooped back down the hall . As they passed the living room , Al said , " This is sure a beautiful place Mr. Pope has got here . " The living room was exquisitely furnished , filled with signed antiques worth a fortune . The floors were covered with mutedcolored Persian rugs . To the left of the living room was a large , formal dining room , and to the right a den , with a large green haize-covered Laraine table in the center In tine ( - timer of this  | room was a round table , already set up for supper . The two servicemen walked into the den , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . " Hmm , " he muttered . He looked up at the ceiling over the card table . " What 's above this room ? " " The attic . " " Let 's take a look . " The workmen followed Andre up to the attic , a long , lowceilinged room , dusty and spattered with cobwebs . Al walked over to an electrical box set in the wall . He inspected the tangle of wires . " Ha ! " " Did you find something ? " Andre asked anxiously . " Condenser problem . It 's the humidity . We musta had a hundred calls this week . It 's shorted out . We 'll have to replace the condenser . " " Oh , my God ! Will it take long ? " " Naw . We got a new condenser out in the truck . " " Please hurry , " Andre begged them . " Mr. Pope is going to be home soon . " " You leave everything to us , " Al said . Back in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing . Can you find your way back up to the attic ? " Al raised a hand . " No sweat , pal . You just go on about your business , and we 'll go on about ours . " " Oh , thank you . Thank you . " Andre watched the men go out to the truck and return with two large canvas bags . " If you need anything , " he told them , " just call me . " " You betcha ! " The workmen went up the stairs , and Andre returned to his kitchen . When Ralph and Al reached the attic , they opened their canvas bags and removed a small folding camp chair , a drill with a steel bit , a tray of sandwiches , two cans of beer , a pair of 12 by 40 Zeiss binoculars for viewing distant objects in a dim light , and two live hamsters that had been injected with three quarters of a milligram of acetyl promazine .

He wo n't never be botherin ' no one again . " They were naked on the water bed in Ernestine 's apartment . " What you gettin ' out of this deal , anyway , honey ? " Al demanded . " He 's a prick . " " Hey , baby , the world 's full of pricks , but you do n't spend your life goin ' around cuttin ' off their balls . " " All right . I 'm doin ' it for a friend . " " Tracy ? " " That 's right .

" " Because if we do n't he'p her , she 's gon na have to settle for someone who ai n't half as good as you , and if she gets caught , they 'll cart her ass right back to the joint . " Al sat up in bed and looked at Ernestine curiously . " Does it mean that much to you , baby ? " " Yeah , hon. " She would never be able to make him understand it , but the truth was simply that Ernestine could not stand the thought of Tracy back in prison at the mercy of Big Bertha . It was not only Tracy whom Ernestine was concerned about : It was herself . She had made herself Tracy 's protector , and if Big Bertha got her hands on her , it would be a defeat for Ernestine . So all she said now was , " Yeah . It means a lot to me , honey . You gon na do it ? " " I damn sure ca n't do it alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won . She started nihhline her  | way down his long , lean body . And she murmured , " Was n't ole Ralph due to be released a few days ago . . . ? " It was 6:30 before the two men returned to Andre 's kitchen , grimy with sweat and dust . " Is it fixed ? " Andre asked anxiously . " It was a real bitch , " Al informed him . " You see , what you got here is a condenser with an AC/DC cutoff that ? " " Never mind that , " Andre interrupted impatiently . " Did you fix it ? " " Yeah . It 's all set . In five minutes we 'll have it goin ' again as good as new . " " Formidable ! If you 'll just leave your bill on the kitchen table ? " Ralph shook his head . " Do n't worry about it . The company 'll bill you . " " Bless you both . Au ' voir . " Andre watched the two men leave by the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , they walked around to the yard and opened the casing that housed the outside condenser of the air-conditioning unit . Ralph held the flashlight while Al reconnected the wires he had loosened a couple hours earlier . The air-conditioning unit immediately sprang into life . Al copied down the telephone number on the service tag attached to the condenser . When he telephoned the number a short time later and reached the recorded voice of the Eskimo Air-Conditioning Company , Al said , " This is Perry Pope 's residence at Forty-two Charles Street . Our air-conditioning is workin ' fine now . Do n't bother to send anyone . Have a nice day . " The weekly Friday-night poker game at Perry Pope 's house was an event to which all the players eagerly looked forward . It was always the same carefully selected group : Anthony Orsatti , Joe Romano , Judge Henry Lawrence , an alderman , a state senator , and of course their host . The stakes were high , the food was great , and the company was raw power . Perry Pone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and matching sport shirt . He hummed happily , thinking of the evening ahead . He had been on a winning streak lately . In fact , my whole life is just one big winning streak , he thought . If anyone needed a legal favor in New Orleans , Perry Pope was the attorney to see . His power came from his connections with the Orsatti Family . He was known as The Arranger , and could fix anything from a traffic ticket to a drug-dealing charge to a murder rap . Life was good . When Anthony Orsatti arrived , he brought a guest with him . " Joe Romano wo n't be playin ' anymore , " Orsatti announced . " You all know Inspector Newhouse . " The men shook hands all around . " Drinks are on the sideboard , gentlemen , " Perry Pope said . " We 'll have supper later . Why do n't we start a little action going ? " The men took their accustomed chairs around the green felt table in the den . Orsatti pointed to Joe Romano 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be your seat from now on , Mel . " While one of the men opened fresh decks of cards , Pope began distributing poker chips . He explained to Inspector Newhouse , " The black chips are five dollars , red chips ten dollars , blue chips fifty dollars , white chips a hundred . Each man starts out buying five hundred dollars ' worth of chips . We play table stakes , three raises , dealer 's choice . " " Sounds good to me , " the inspector said . Anthony Orsatti was in a bad mood . " Come on . Let 's get started . " His voice was a strangled whisper . Not a good sign . Perry Pope would have given a great deal to learn what had happened to Joe Romano , but the lawyer knew better than to bring up the subject . Orsatti would discuss it with him when he was ready . Orsatti 's thoughts were black : I been like a father to Joe Romano . I trusted him , made him my chief lieutenant . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If that dizzy French dame had n't telephoned , he might have gotten away - rich it , too . Well , he - wo n't ever get away with nothin ' again . Not where he is . If he 's so clever , let him fuck around with the fish down there .  | " Tony , are you in or out ? " Anthony Orsatti turned his attention back to the game . Huge sums of money had been won and lost at this table . It always upset Anthony Orsatti to lose , and it had nothing to do with money . He could not bear to be on the losing end of anything . He thought of himself as a natural-born winner . Only winners rose to his position in life . For the last six weeks , Perry Pope had been on some kind of crazy winning streak , and tonight Anthony Orsatti was determined to break it . Since they played dealer 's choice , each dealer chose the game in which he felt the strongest . Hands were dealt for five-card stud , seven-card stud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter which game was chosen , Anthony Orsatti kept finding himself on the losing end . He began to increase his bets , playing recklessly , trying to recoup his losses . By midnight when they stopped to have the meal Andre had prepared , Orsatti was out $50,000 , with Perry Pope the big winner . The food was delicious . Usually Orsatti enjoyed the free midnight snack , but this evening he was impatient to get back to the table . " You 're not eating , Tony , " Perry Pope said . " I 'm not hungry . " Orsatti reached for the silver coffee urn at his side , poured coffee into a Victoria-patterned Herendchina cup , and sat down at the poker table . He watched the others eat and wished they would hurry . He was impatient to win his money back . As he started to stir his coffee , a small particle fell into his cup . Distastefully , Orsatti removed the particle with a spoon and examined it . It appeared to be a piece of plaster . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forehead . He suddenly became aware of a scurrying noise overhead . " What the hell 's goin ' on upstairs ? " Anthony Orsatti asked . Perry Pope was in the middle of telling an anecdote to Inspector Newhouse . " I 'm sorry , what did you say , Tony ? " The scurrying noise was more noticeable now . Bits of plaster began to trickle onto the green felt . " It sounds to me like you have mice , " the senator said . " Not in this house . " Perry Pope was indignant . " Well , you sure as hell got somethin ' , " Orsatti growled .  | A larger piece of plaster fell on the green felt table . " I 'll have Andre take care of it , " Pope said . " If we 're finished eating , why do n't we get back to the game ? " Anthony Orsatti was staring up at a small hole in the ceiling directly above his head . " Hold it . Let 's go take a look up there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Orsatti had already risen and started for the stairway . The others looked at one another , then hurried after him . " A squirrel probably got into the attic , " Perry Pope guessed . " This time of year they 're all over the place . Probably hiding his nuts for the winter . " He laughed at his little joke . When they reached the door to the attic , Orsatti pushed it open , and Perry Pope turned on the light . They caught a glimpse of two white hamsters frantically racing around the room . " Jesus ! " Perry Pope said . " I 've got rats ! " Anthony Orsatti was not listening . He was staring at the room . In the middle of the attic was a camp chair with a packet of sandwiches on top of it and two open cans of beer . On the floor next to the chair was a pair of binoculars . Orsatti walked over to them , picked up the objects one by one , and examined them . Then he got down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden cylinder that concealed a peephole that had been drilled into the ceiling . Orsatti put his eye to the peephole . Directly beneath him the card table was clearly visible . Perry Pope was standing in the middle of the attic , dumbfounded . " Who the hell put all this junk up here ? I 'm going to raise hell with Andre about this . " Orsatti rose slowly to his feet and brushed the dust from his trousers . Perry Pope glanced down at the floor . " Look ! " he exclaimed . " They left a goddamned hole in the ceiling . Workmen today are n't worth a shit . " He crouched down and took a look through the hole , and his face suddenly lost its color . Ile stood up and looked around wildly , to find all the men staring at him . " it  --  vi " PPrrry l ) t-nt ? ctitl " Veal cic , n't thitilr NNNNN , it  | fellas , this is me . I do n't know anything about this . I would n't cheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hand flew to his mouth , and he began biting furiously at his cuticles . Orsatti patted him on the arm . " Do n't worry about it . " His voice was almost inaudible . Perry Pope kept gnawing desperately at the raw flesh of his right thumb .  | " That 's two down , Tracy , " Ernestine Littlechap chortled . " The word on the street is that your lawyer friend Perry Pope ai n't practicin ' law no more . He had a real bad accident . " They were having cafe au lait and beignets at a small sidewalk cafe off Royal Street . Ernestine gave a high giggle . " You got a brain , girl . You would n't like to go into business with me , would you ? " " Thanks , Ernestine . I have other plans . " Ernestine asked eagerly , " Who 's next ? " " Lawrence . Judge Henry Lawrence . " Henry Lawrence had begun his career as a small-town lawyer in Leesville , Louisiana . He had very little aptitude for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was impressive-looking , and he was morally flexible . His philosophy was that the law was a frail rod , meant to be bent to suit the needs of his clients . With that in mind , it was not surprising that shortly after he moved to New Orleans , Henry Lawrence 's law practice began to flourish with a special group of clients . He went from handling misdemeanors and traffic ac-  | cidents to handling felonies and capital crimes , and by the time he reached the big leagues , he was an expert at suborning juries , discrediting witnesses , and bribing anyone who could help his case . In short , he was Anthony Orsatti 's kind of man , and it was inevitable that the paths of the two should cross . It was a marriage made in Mafia heaven . Lawrence became the mouthpiece for the Orsatti Family , and when the timing was right , Orsatti had him elevated to a judgeship . " I do n't know how you kin nail the judge , " Ernestine said . " He 's rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rich and powerful , " Tracy corrected her , " but he 's not untouchable . " Tracy had worked out her plan , but when she telephoned Judge Lawrence 's chambers , she knew , immediately , that she would have to change it . " I 'd like to speak to Judge Lawrence , please . " A secretary said , " I 'm sorry , Judge Lawrence is not in . " " When do you expect him ? " Tracy asked . " I really could n't say . " " It 's very important . Will he be in tomorrow morning ? " " No . Judge Lawrence is out of town . " " Oh . Perhaps I can reach him somewhere ? " " I 'm afraid that would be impossible . His Honor is out of the country . " Tracy carefully kept the disappointment from her voice . " I see . May I ask where ? " " His Honor is in Europe , attending an international judiciary symposium . " " What a shame , " Tracy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was racing . " This is Elizabeth Rowane Dastin , chairwoman of the southern division of the American Trial Lawyers ' Association . We 're having our annual awards dinner in New Orleans on the twentieth of this month , and we 've chosen Judge Henry Lawrence to be our man of the year . " " " I'hat 's lovely , " the judge 's secretary said , " but I 'm afraid His Honor wo n't be back by then . " " What a nitv . We were all so looking forward to hearing  | one of his famous speeches . Judge Lawrence was the unanimous choice of our selection committee . " " He 'll be disappointed to miss it . " " Yes . I 'm sure you know what a great honor this is . Some of our country 's most prominent judges have been chosen in the past . Wait a minute ! I have an idea . Do you suppose the judge might tape a brief acceptance speech for us  --  a few words of thanks , perhaps ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a very busy schedule ? " " There 'll be a great deal of national television and newspaper coverage . " There was a silence . Judge Lawrence 's secretary knew how much His Honor enjoyed media coverage . In fact , as far as she could see , the tour he was presently on seemed to be mainly for that purpose . She said , " Perhaps he might find time to record a few words for you . I could ask him . " " Oh , that would be wonderful , " Tracy enthused . " It would really make the whole evening . " " Would you like His Honor to address his remarks toward anything specific ? " " Oh , definitely . We 'd like him to talk about ? " She hesitated . " I 'm afraid it 's a bit complicated . It would be better if I could explain it to him directly . " There was a momentary silence .

To tell you the truth , I wish we had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Anthony Orsatti , and the capo was unable to figure out why . For the first time in his life , his luck was going bad . It had started with Joe Romano 's defection , then Perry Pope , and now the judge was gone , mixed up in some crazy spy deal . They had all been an intrinsic part of Orsatti 's machine  --  people he had relied on . Joe Romano had been the linchpin in the Family organization , and Orsatti had not found anyone to take his place . The business was being run sloppily , and complaints were coming in from people who had never dared complain before . The word was out that Tony Orsatti was getting old , that he could n't keep his men in line , that his organization was coming apart . The final straw was a telephone call from New Jersey . " We hear you 're in a little trouble back there , Tony . We 'd like to help you out . " " I ai n't in no trouble , " Orsatti bristled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , but they 're all straightened out . " " That 's not what we hear , Tony . The word 's out that your town 's goin ' a little wild ; there 's no one controlling it . " " I 'm controlling it . " " Maybe it 's too much for you . Could be you 're working too hard . Maybe you need a little rest . " " This is my town . No one 's takin ' it away from me . " " Hey , Tony , who said anything about taking it away from you ? We just want to help . The Families back east got together and decided to send a few of our people down there to give you a little hand . There 's nothing wrong with that between old friends , is there ? " Anthony Orsatti felt a deep chill go through him . There was only one thing wrong with it : The little hand was going to become a big hand , and it was going to snowball . * * *  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simmering on the stove while she and Tracy waited for Al to arrive . The September heat wave had burned itself deeply into everyone 's nerves , and when Al finally walked into the small apartment , Ernestine screamed , " Where the hell you been ? The fuckin ' dinner 's burning , and so am I. " But Al 's spirits were too euphoric to be affected . " I been busy diggin ' the scam , woman . An ' wait 'll you hear what I got . " He turned to Tracy . " The mob 's puttin ' the arm on Tony Orsatti . The Family from New Jersey 's comin ' in to take over . " His face split into a broad grin . " You got the son of a bitch ! " He looked into Tracy 's eyes , and his smile died . " Ai n't you happy , Tracy ? " What a strange word , Tracy thought . Happy . She had forgotten what it meant . She wondered whether she would ever be happy again , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long now , her every waking thought had been to avenge what had been done to her mother and herself . And now that it was almost finished , there was only an emptiness inside her . The following morning Tracy stopped at a florist . " I want some flowers delivered to Anthony Orsatti . A funeral wreath of white carnations on a stand , with a wide ribbon . I want the ribbon to read : REST IN PEACE . ' " She wrote out a card . It said , FROM DORIS WHITNEY 'S DAUGHTER .  | Philadelphia TUESDAY , OCTOBER 7 ? 4:00 P.M. It was time to deal with Charles Stanhope III . The had been strangers . Charles had been her lover , the fai her unborn child , and he had turned his back on both of Ernestine and Al had been at the New Orleans Airl see Tracy off . " I 'm gon na miss you , " Ernestine had said . " You si this town on its ass . They ought a run you for people 's m ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked . She had told them half the truth . " Go back to my ( at the bank . " Ernestine and Al had exchanged a glance . " They  --  eryou 're comin ' ? " " No . But the vice-president likes me . There won ' problem . Good computer operators are hard to find . "  | " Well , good luck . Keep in touch , ya hear ? And stay out of trouble , girl . " Thirty minutes later Tracy had been in the air , bound for Philadelphia . She checked into the Hilton Hotel and steamed out her one good dress over the hot tub . At 11:00 the following morning she walked into the bank and approached Clarence Desmond 's secretary . " Hello , Mae . " The girl stared at Tracy as though she were seeing a ghost . " Tracy ! " She did not know where to look . " I  --  how are you ? " " Fine . Is Mr. Desmond in ? " " I  --  I do n't know . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair , flustered , and hurried into the vice-president 's office . She came out a few moments later . " You may go in . " She edged away as Tracy walked toward the door . What 's the matter with her ? Tracy wondered . Clarence Desmond was standing next to his desk . " Hello , Mr. Desmond . Well , I 've come back , " Tracy said brightly . " What for ? " His tone was unfriendly . Definitely unfriendly . It caught Tracy by surprise . She pressed on . " Well , you said I was the best computer operator you had ever seen , and I thought ? " " You thought I 'd give you back your old job ? " " Well , yes , sir . I have n't forgotten any of my skills . I can still ? " " Miss Whitney . " It was no longer Tracy . " I 'm sorry , but what you 're asking is quite out of the question . I 'm sure you can understand that our customers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the penitentiary for armed robbery and attempted murder . That would hardly fit in with our high ethical image . I think it unlikely that given your background , any bank would hire you . I would suggest that you try to find employment more suitable to your circumstances . 1 hone you understand there is nothing ncrsonal in this "  | Tracy listened to his words , first with shock and then with growing anger . He made her sound like an outcast , a leper . We would n't want to lose you . You 're one of our most valuable employees . " Was there anything else , Miss Whitney ? " It was a dismissal . There were a hundred things Tracy wanted to say , but she knew they would do no good . " No . I think you 've said it all . " Tracy turned and walked out the office door , her face burning . All the bank employees seemed to be staring at her . Mae had spread the word : The convict had come back . Tracy moved toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't let them do this to me . My pride is all I have left , and no one is going to take that away from me . Tracy stayed in her room all day , miserable . How could she have been naive enough to believe that they would welcome her back with open arms ? She was notorious now . " You 're the headline in the Philadelphia Daily News . " Well , to hell with Philadelphia , Tracy thought . She had some unfinished business there , but when that was done , she would leave . She would go to New York , where she would be anonymous . The decision made her feel better . That evening , Tracy treated herself to dinner at the Cafe Royal . After the sordid meeting with Clarence Desmond that morning , she needed the reassuring atmosphere of soft lights , elegant surroundings , and soothing music . She ordered a vodka martini , and as the waiter brought it to her table , Tracy glanced up , and her heart suddenly skipped a beat . Seated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had not yet seen her . Tracy 's first impulse was to get up and leave . She was not ready to face Charles , not until she had a chance to put her plan into action . " Would you like to order now ? " the captain was asking . " I 'll  --  I 'll wait , thank you . " She had to decide whether she was going to stay . She looked over at Charles again , and an astonishing phenomenon occurred : It was as though she were looking at a stranger . She was seeing a sallow , drawn-looking , middle-aged ,  | balding man , with stooped shoulders and an air of ineffable boredom on his face . It was impossible to believe that she had once thought she loved this man , that she had slept with him , planned to spend the rest of her life with him . Tracy glanced at his wife . She wore the same bored expression as Charles . They gave the impression of two people trapped together for eternity , frozen in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . Tracy could visualize the endless , tedious years ahead of the two of them . No love . No joy . That is Charles 's punishment , Tracy thought , and she felt a sudden surge of release , a freedom from the deep , dark , emotional chains that had bound her . Tracy signaled to the captain and said , " I 'm ready to order now . " It was over . The past was finally buried . It was not until Tracy returned to her hotel room that evening that she remembered she was owed money from the bank 's employees ' fund . She sat down and calculated the amount . It came to $1,375.65 . She composed a letter to Clarence Desmond , and two days later she received a reply from Mae . Dear Miss Whitney : In response to your request , Mr. Desmond has asked me to inform you that because of the morals policy in the employees ' financial plan , your share has reverted to the general fund . He wants to assure you that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mae Trenton Secretary to the Senior Vice-president Tracy could not believe it . They were stealing her money , and doing it under the pretext of protecting the morals of the bank ! She was outraged . I 'm not going to let them cheat me , she vowed . No one is ever going to cheat me again . Tracy stood outside the familiar entrance to the Philadelphia Trust and Fidelity Bank . She wore a long black wig and heavy , dark makeup , with a raw red scar on her chin . If anythine went wrong it would he the scar they rememhered lr  | spite her disguise , Tracy felt naked , for she had worked in this bank for five years , and it was staffed with people who knew her well . She would have to be very careful not to give herself away . She removed a bottle cap from her purse , placed it in her shoe , and limped into the bank . The bank was crowded with customers , for Tracy had carefully chosen a time when the bank would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customer-service desks , and the man seated behind it finished a phone call and said , " Yes ? " It was Jon Creighton , the bank bigot . He hated Jews , blacks , and Puerto Ricans , but not necessarily in that order . He had been an irritant to Tracy during the years she had worked there . Now there was no sign of recognition on his face . " Buenas dias , senor . I would like to open a checking account , ahora , " Tracy said . Her accent was Mexican , the accent she had heard for all those months from her cell mate Paulita . There was a look of disdain on Creighton 's face . " Name ? " " Rita Gonzales . " " And how much would you like to put in your account ? " " Ten dollars . " His voice was a sneer . " Will that be by check or cash ? " " Cash , I theenk . " She carefully took a crumpled , half-torn ten-dollar bill from her purse and handed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fill this out ? " Tracy had no intention of putting anything in her handwriting . She frowned . " I 'm sorry , senor . I hurt mi mano  --  my hand  --  in an accident . Would you min ' writin ' it for me , si se puede ? " Creighton snorted . These illiterate wetbacks ! " Rita Gonzales , you said ? " " Si . " " Your address ? " She gave him the address and telephone number of her hotel . ? ' Ynur mother 's maiden name ? "  | " Gonzales . My mother , she married her uncle . " " And your date of birth ? " " December twentieth , 1958 . " " Place of birth ? " " Ciudad de Mexico . " " Mexico City . Sign here . " " I weel have to use my left hand , " Tracy said . She picked up a pen and clumsily scrawled out an illegible signature . Jon Creighton wrote out a deposit slip . " I 'll give you a temporary checkbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four weeks . " " Bueno . Muchas gracias , senor . " " Yeah . " He watched her walk out of the bank . Fuckin ' spit . There are numerous illegal ways to gain entry to a computer , and Tracy was an expert . She had helped set up the security system at the Philadelphia Trust and Fidelity Bank , and now she was about to circumvent it . Her first step was to find a computer store , where she could use a terminal to tap into the bank 's computer . The store , several blocks from the bank , was almost empty . An eager salesman approached Tracy . " May I help you , miss ? " " Eso si que no , senor . I am just looking . " His eye was caught by a teen-ager playing a computer game . " Excuse me . " He hurried away . Tracy turned to the desk-model computer in front of her , which was connected to a telephone . Getting into the system would be easy , but without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access code was changed daily . Tracy had been at the meeting when the original authorization code had been decided on . " We must keep changing it , " Clarence Desmond had said , " so no one can break in ; yet we want to keep it simple enough for people who are authorized to use it . " The code they had finally settled on used the four seasons of the year and the current day 's date . Tracy turned on the terminal and tapped out the code for  | the Philadelphia Trust and Fidelity Bank . She heard a highpitched whine and placed the telephone receiver into the terminal modem . A sign flashed on the small screen : YOUR AUTHORIZATION CODE , PLEASE ? Today was the tenth . FALL I0 , Tracy tapped out . THAT IS AN IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CODE . The computer screen went blank . ' Had they changed the code ? Out of the corner of her eye , Tracy saw the salesman coming toward her again . She moved over to another computer , gave it a casual glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stride . A looker , he decided . He hurried forward to greet a prosperous-looking couple coming in the door . Tracy returned to the desk-model computer . She tried to put herself into Clarence Desmond 's mind . He was a creature of habit , and Tracy was sure he would not have varied the code too much . He had probably kept the original concept of the seasons and the numbers , but how had he changed them ? It would have been too complicated to reverse all the numbers , so he had probably shifted the seasons around . Tracy tried again . YOUR AUTHORIZATION CODE , PLEASE ? WINTER I0 . THAT IS AN IMPROPER AUTHORIZATION CODE . The blank screen again . It 's not going to work , Tracy thought despairingly . I 'll give it one more try . YOUR AUTHORIZATION CODE , PLEASE ? SPRING I0 . The screen went blank for a moment , and then the message appeared : PLEASE PROCEED . So he had switched the seasons . She quickly typed out : DOMESTIC MONEY TRANSACTION . Instantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed onto the screen : DO YOU WISH TO A DEPOSIT MONEY B TRANSFER MONEY  | C WITHDRAW MONEY FROM SAVINGS ACCOUNT D INTERBRANCH TRANSFER E WITHDRAW MONEY FROM CHECKING ACCOUNT PLEASE ENTER YOUR CHOICE Tracy chose B. The screen went blank and a new menu appeared . AMOUNT OF TRANSFER ? WHERE TO ? WHERE FROM ? She typed in : FROM GENERAL RESERVE FUND TO RITA GONZALES . When she came to the amount , she hesitated for an instant . Tempting , Tracy thought . Since she had access , there was no limit to the amount the now subservient computer would give her . She could have taken millions . But she was no thief . All she wanted was what was rightfully owed her . She typed in $1,375.65 , and added Rita Gonzales 's account number . The screen flashed : TRANSACTION COMPLETED . DO YOU WISH OTHER TRANSACTIONS ? NO . SESSION COMPLETED . THANK YOU . The money would automatically be transferred by CHIPS , the Clearing House Interbank Payment System that kept track of the $220 billion shifted from bank to bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frowning . Tracy hurriedly pressed a key , and the screen went blank . " Are you interested in purchasing this machine , miss ? " " No , gracias , " Tracy apologized . " I don ' understan ' these computers . " She telephoned the bank from a corner drug store and asked to speak to the head cashier . " Hola . Thees is Rita Gonzales . I would like to have my checkin ' account transferred to the main branch of the First Hanover Bank of New York City , por favor . " " Your account number , Miss Gonzales ? " Tracy gave it to her . An hour later Tracy had checked out of the I Tilton and was on her way to New York City . When the First Hanover Bank of Ncw York onened at 10:00  | the following morning , Rita Gonzales was there to withdraw all the money from her account . " How much ees ' in it ? " she asked . The teller checked . " Thirteen hundred seventy-five dollars and sixty-five cents . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like a certified check for that , Miss Gon-zales ? " " No , gracias , " Tracy said . " I don ' trust banks . I weel take the cash . " Tracy had received the standard two hundred dollars from the state prison upon her release , plus the small amount of money she had earned taking care of Amy , but even with her money from the bank fund , she had no financial security . It was imperative she get a job as quickly as possible . She checked into an inexpensive hotel on Lexington Avenue and began sending out applications to New York banks , applying for a job as a computer expert . But Tracy found that the computer had suddenly become her enemy . Her life was no longer private . The computer banks held her life 's story , and readily told it to everyone who pressed the right buttons . The moment Tracy 's criminal record was revealed , her application was automatically rejected . I think it unlikely that given your background , any bank would hire you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job applications to insurance companies and dozens of other computer-oriented businesses . The replies were always the same : negative . Very well , Tracy thought , I can always do something else . She bought a copy of The New York Times and began searching the want ads . There was a position listed as secretary in an export firm . The moment Tracy walked in the door , the personnel manager said , " Hey , I seen you on television . You saved a kid in prison , did n't you ? " Tracy turned and fled . The following day she was hired as a saleswoman in the children 's department at Saks Fifth Avenue . The salary was a  | great deal less than she had been used to , but at least it was enough to support herself . On her second day , a hysterical customer recognized her and informed the floor manager that she refused to be waited on by a murderess who had drowned a small child . Tracy was given no chance to explain . She was discharged immediately . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacted vengeance had had the last word after all . They had turned her into a public criminal , an outcast . The unfairness of what was happening to her was corrosive . She had no idea how she was going to live , and for the first time she began to have a feeling of desperation . That night she looked through her purse to see how much money remained , and tucked away in a corner of her wallet she came across the slip of paper that Betty Franciscus had given her in prison . CONRAD MORGAN , JEWELER , 640 FIFTH AVENUE , NEW YORK CITY . He 's into criminal reform . He likes to give a hand to people who 've been in prison . Conrad Morgan et Cie Jewelers was an elegant establishment , with a liveried doorman on the outside and an armed guard on the inside . The shop itself was tastefully understated , but the jewels were exquisite and expensive . Tracy told the receptionist inside , " I 'd like to see Mr. Conrad Morgan , please . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a mutual friend suggested that I see him . " " Your name ? " " Tracy Whitney . " " Just a moment , please . " The receptionist picked up a telephone and murmured something into it that Tracy could not hear . She replaced the receiver . " Mr. Morgan is occupied just now . He wonders if you could come back at six o'clock . " " Yes , thank you , " Tracy said . She walked out of the shop and stood on the sidewalk , uncertainly . Coming to New York had been a mistake . There was probably nothing Conrad Morgan could do for her . And why should he ? Shc was a complete stranger to him . ! /ell dive me  | a lecture and a handout . Well , I do n't need either . Not from him or anyone else . I 'm a survivor . Somehow I 'm going to make it . To hell with Conrad Morgan . I wo n't go back to see him . Tracy wandered the streets aimlessly , passing the glittering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Avenue , the bustling shops on Lexington and Third . She walked the streets of New York mindlessly , seeing nothing , filled with a bitter frustration . At 6:00 she found herself back on Fifth Avenue , in front of Conrad Morgan et Cie Jewelers . The doorman was gone , and the door was locked . Tracy pounded on the door in a gesture of defiance and then turned away , but to her surprise , the door suddenly opened . An avuncular-looking man stood there looking at her . He was bald , with ragged tufts of gray hair above his ears , and he had a jolly , rubicund face and twinkling blue eyes . He looked like a cheery little gnome . " You must be Miss Whitney ? " " Yes . . . . " " I 'm Conrad Morgan . Please , do come in , wo n't you ? " Tracy entered the deserted store . " I 've been waiting for you , " Conrad Morgan said . " Let 's go into my office where we can talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , which he unlocked with a key . His office was elegantly furnished , and it looked more like an apartment than a place of business , with no desk , just couches , chairs , and tables artfully placed . The walls were covered with old masters . " Would you care for a drink ? " Conrad Morgan offered . " Whiskey , cognac , or perhaps sherry ? " " No , nothing , thank you . " Tracy was suddenly nervous . She had dismissed the idea that this man would do anything to help her , yet at the same time she found herself desperately hoping that he could . " Betty Franciscus suggested that I look you up , Mr. Morgan . She said you  --  you helped people who have been in . . . trouble . " She could not bring herself to say prison . Conrad Morgan clasped his hands together , and Tracy noticed how beautifully manicured they were .  | " Poor Betty . Such a lovely lady . She was unlucky , you know . " " Unlucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I  --  I do n't understand . " " It 's really quite simple , Miss Whitney . Betty used to work for me . She was well protected . Then the poor dear fell in love with a chauffeur from New Orleans and went off on her own . And , well . . . they caught her . " Tracy was confused . " She worked for you here as a sales-lady ? " Conrad Morgan sat back and laughed until his eyes filled with tears . " No , my dear , " he said , wiping the tears away . " Obviously , Betty did n't explain everything to you . " He leaned back in his chair and steepled his fingers . " I have a very profitable little sideline , Miss Whitney , and I take great pleasure in sharing those profits with my colleagues . I have been most successful employing people like yourself  --  if you 'll forgive me  --  who have served time in prison . " Tracy studied his face , more puzzled that ever . " I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely wealthy clientele . My clients become my friends . They confide in me . " He tapped his fingers together delicately . " I know when my customers take trips . Very few people travel with jewelry in these parlous times , so their jewels are locked away at home . I recommend to them the security measures they should take to protect them . I know exactly what jewels they own because they purchased them from me . They ? " Tracy found herself on her feet . " Thank you for your time , Mr. Morgan . " " Surely you 're not leaving already ? " " If you 're saying what I think you 're saying ? " " Yes . Indeed , I am . " She could feel her cheeks burning . " I 'm not a criminal . I came here looking for a job . " " And I 'm offering you one , my dear . It will take an hour or two of your time , and I can promise you twenty-five thousand dollars . " He smiled impishly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fighting hard to control her anger . " I 'm not interested . Would you let me out , please ? " " Certainly , if that is what you wish . " He rose to his feet and showed her to the door . " You must understand , Miss Whitney , that if there were the slightest danger of anyone 's being caught , I would not be involved in this . I have my reputation to protect . " " I promise you I wo n't say anything about it , " Tracy said coldly . He grinned . " There 's really nothing you could say , my dear , is there ? I mean , who would believe you ? I am Conrad Morgan . " As they reached the front entrance of the store , Morgan said , " You will let me know if you change your mind , wo n't you ? The best time to telephone me is after six o'clock in the evening . I 'll wait for your call . " " Do n't , " Tracy said curtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she reached her room , she was still trembling . She sent the hotel 's one bellboy out for a sandwich and coffee . She did not feel like facing anyone . The meeting with Conrad Morgan had made her feel unclean . He had lumped her with all the sad , confused , and beaten criminals she had been surrounded by at the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women . She was not one of them . She was Tracy Whitney , a computer expert , a decent , law-abiding citizen . Whom no one would hire . Tracy lay awake all night thinking about her future . She had no job , and very little money left . She made two resolutions : In the morning she would move to a cheaper place and she would find a job . Any kind of job . The cheaper place turned out to be a dreary fourth-floor walkup , one-room apartment on the Lower East Side . From her room , through the paper-thin walls , Tracy could hear her neighbors screaming at one another in foreign languages . The windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were heavily barred , and Tracy could understand why . The  | neighborhood seemed to be populated by drunks , prostitutes , and bag ladies . On her way to the market to shop , Tracy was accosted three times  --  twice by men and once by a woman . I can stand it . I wo n't be here long , Tracy assured herself . She went to a small employment agency a few blocks from her apartment . It was run by a Mrs. Murphy , a matronly looking , heavy-set lady . She put down Tracy 's resume and studied her quizzically . " I do n't know what you need me for . There must be a dozen companies that 'd give their eyeteeth to get someone like you . " Tracy took a deep breath . " I have a problem , " she said . She explained as Mrs. Murphy sat listening quietly , and when Tracy was finished , Mrs. Murphy said flatly , " You can forget about looking for a computer job . " " But you said ? " " Companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gon na hire anybody with a record . " " But I need a job . I ? " " There are other kinds of jobs . Have you thought about working as a saleslady ? " Tracy remembered her experience at the department store . She could not bear to go through that again . " Is there anything else ? " The woman hesitated . Tracy Whitney was obviously overqualified for the job Mrs. Murphy had in mind . " Look , " she said . " I know this is n't up your alley , but there 's a waitress job open at Jackson Hole . It 's a hamburger place on the Upper East Side . " " A waitress job ? " " Yeah . If you take it , I wo n't charge you any commission . I just happened to hear about it . " Tracy sat there , debating . She had waited on tables in college . Then it had been fun . Now it was a question of surviving . " I 'll try it , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with noisy and impatient customers , and harassed , irritable fry cooks . The food was good and the prices reasonable , and the place was always jammed . The waitresses worked at a frantic pace with no time to relax , and by the end of the first day Tracy was exhausted . But she was earning money . At noon on the second day , as Tracy was serving a table filled with salesmen , one of the men ran his hand up her skirt , and Tracy dropped a bowl of chili on his head . That was the end of the job . She returned to Mrs. Murphy and reported what had happened . " I may have some good news , " Mrs. Murphy said . " The Wellington Arms needs an assistant housekeeper . I 'm going to send you over there . " The Wellington Arms was a small , elegant hotel on Park Avenue that catered to the rich and famous . Tracy was interviewed by the housekeeper and hired . The work was not difficult , the staff was pleasant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracy was summoned to the housekeeper 's office . The assistant manager was also there . " Did you check Suite eight-twenty-seven today ? " the housekeeper asked Tracy . The suite was occupied by Jennifer Marlowe , a Hollywood actress . Part of Tracy 's job was to inspect each suite and see that the maids had done their work properly . " Why , yes , " she said . " What time ? " " At two o'clock . Is something wrong ? " The assistant manager spoke up . " At three o'clock Miss Marlowe returned and discovered that a valuable diamond ring was missing . " Tracy could feel her body grow tense . " Did you go into the bedroom , Tracy ? " " Yes . I checked every room . " " When you were in the bedroom , did you see any jewelry lying around ? " " Why . . . no . I do n't think so . "  | The assistant manager pounced on it . " You do n't think so ? You 're not sure ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I was checking the beds and towels . " " Miss Marlowe insists that her ring was on the dressing table when she left the suite . " " I do n't know anything about it . " " No one else has access to that room . The maids have been with us for many years . " " I did n't take it . " The assistant manager sighed . " We 're going to have to call in the police to investigate . " " It had to be someone else , " Tracy cried . " Or perhaps Miss Marlowe misplaced it . " " With your record ? " the assistant manager said . And there it was , out in the open . With your record . . . . " I 'll have to ask you to please wait in the security office until the police get here . " Tracy felt her face flush . " Yes , sir . " She was accompanied to the office by one of the security guards , and she felt as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicts being hounded because they had prison records , but it had never occurred to her that this kind of thing could happen to her . They had stuck a label on her , and they expected her to live up to it . Or down to it , Tracy thought bitterly . Thirty minutes later the assistant manager walked into the office , smiling . " Well ! " he said . " Miss Marlowe found her ring . She had misplaced it , after all . It was just a little mistake . " " Wonderful , " Tracy said . She walked out of the office and headed for Conrad Morgan et Cie Jewelers . " It 's ridiculously simple , " Conrad Morgan was saying . " A client of mine , Lois Bellamy , has gone to Europe . Her house is in Sea Cliff , on Long Island . On weekends the servants are off , so there 's no one there . A private patrol makes a check evey four hours . You can be in and out of the house in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . " I know the alarm system , and I have the combination to the safe . All you have to do , my dear , is walk in , pick up the jewels , and walk out again . You bring the jewels to me , I take them out of their settings , recut the larger ones , and sell them again . " " If it 's so simple , why do n't you do it yourself ? " Tracy asked bluntly . His blue eyes twinkled . " Because I 'm going to be out of town on business . Whenever one of these little incidents ' occurs , I 'm always out of town on business . " " I see . " " If you have any scruples about the robbery hurting Mrs. Bellamy , you need n't have . She 's really quite a horrible woman , who has houses all over the world filled with expensive goodies . Besides , she 's insured for twice the amount the jewels are worth . Naturally , I did all the appraisals . " Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be crazy . I 'm sitting here calmly discussing a jewel robbery with this man . " I do n't want to go back to prison , Mr. Morgan . " " There 's no danger of that . Not one of my people has ever been caught . Not while they were working for me . Well . . . what do you say ? " That was obvious . She was going to say no . The whole idea was insane . " You said twenty-five thousand dollars ? " " Cash on delivery . " It was a fortune , enough to take care of her until she could figure out what to do with her life . She thought of the dreary little room she lived in , of the screaming tenants , and the customer yelling , " I do n't want a murderess waiting on me , " and the assistant manager saying , " We 're going to have to call in the police to investigate . " But Tracy still could not bring herself to say yes . " I would suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The staff leaves at noon on Saturdays . I 'll arrange a driver 's license and a credit card for you in a false name . You 'll rent a car here in Manhattan and drive out to Long Island , arriving  | at eleven o'clock . You 'll pick up the jewelry , drive back to New York , and return the car . . . . You do drive , do n't you ? " " Yes . " " Excellent . There 's a train leaving for St. Louis at sevenforty-five A.M. I 'll reserve a compartment for you . I 'll meet you at the station in St. Louis , you 'll turn over the jewels , and I 'll give you your twenty-five thousand . " He made it all sound so simple . This was the moment to say no , to get up and walk out . Walk out to where ? " I 'll need a blond wig , " Tracy said slowly . When Tracy had left , Conrad Morgan sat in the dark in his office , thinking about her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a shame . Perhaps he should have warned her that he was not really that familiar with that particular burglar-alarm system .  | With the thousand dollars that Conrad Morgan advanced her , Tracy purchased two wigs  --  one blond and one black , with a multitude of tiny braids . She bought a dark-blue pants suit , black coveralls , and an irpitation Gucci valise from a street vendor on Lexington Avenue . So far everything was going smoothly . As Morgan had promised , Tracy received an envelope containing a driver 's license in the name of Ellen Branch , a diagram of the security system in the Bellamy house , the combination to the bedroom safe , and an Amtrak ticket to St. Louis , in a private compartment . Tracy packed her few belongings and left . I 'll never live in a place like this again , Tracy promised herself . She rented a car and headed for Long Island . She was on her way to commit a burglary . What she was doing had the unreality of a dream , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk worth what she was about to do ? It 's ridiculously simple , Conrad Morgan had said . Ile would n't be involved in anything like this if he were n't sure about it . Ile has his reputation to protect . I have a reputation , too , Tracy thought bitterly , and it 's all bad . Any time  | a piece of jewelry is missing , I 'll be guilty until proven innocent . Tracy knew what she was doing : She was trying to work herself up into a rage , trying to psych herself up to commit a crime . It did not work . By the time she reached Sea Cliff , she was a nervous wreck . Twice , she almost ran the car off the road . Maybe the police will pick me up for reckless driving , she thought hopefully , and I can tell Mr. Morgan that things went wrong . But there was not a police car in sight . Sure , Tracy thought , in disgust . They 're never around when you need them . She headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The house is right on the water . It 's called the Embers . It 's an old Victorian mansion . You ca n't miss it . Please let me miss it , Tracy prayed . But there it was , looming up out of the dark like some ogre 's castle in a nightmare . It looked deserted . How dare the servants take the weekend off , Tracy thought indignantly . They should all be discharged . She drove the car behind a stand of giant willow trees , where it was hidden from view , and turned off the engine , listening to the nocturnal sounds of insects . Nothing else disturbed the silence . The house was off the main road , and there was no traffic at that time of night . The property is screened by trees , my dear , and the nearest neighbor is acres away , so you do n't have to be concerned about being seen . The security patrol makes its check at ten P.M. and again at two A.M. You 'll be long gone by the two A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11:00 . The first patrol had gone . She had three hours before the patrol was due to arrive for its second check . Or three seconds to turn the car around and head back to New York and forget about this insanity . But head back to what ? The images flashed unbidden into her mind . The assistant manager at Saks : " I 'm terribly sorry , Miss Whitney , but our customers must be humored . . . . " " You can forget about running a computer . " They 're not going to hire anybody with a record . . . . " " Twenty-five thousand tax-free dollars for an hour or two .  | If you have scruples , she 's really a horrible woman . " What am I doing ? Tracy thought . I 'm not a burglar . Not a real one . I 'm a dumb amateur who 's about to have a nervous breakdown . If I had half a brain , I 'd get away from here while there 's still time . Before the SWAT team catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddled body to the morgue . I can see the headline : DANGEROUS CRIMINAL KILLED DURING BUNGLED BURGLARY ATTEMPT . Who would be there to cry at her funeral ? Ernestine and Amy . Tracy looked at her watch . " Oh , my God . " She had been sitting there , daydreaming , for twenty minutes . If I 'm going to do it , I 'd better move . She could not move . She was frozen with fear . I ca n't sit here forever , she told herself . Why do n't I just go take a look at the house ? A quick look . Tracy took a deep breath and got out of the car . She was wearing black coveralls ; her knees were shaking . She approached the house slowly , and she could see that it was completely dark . Be sure to wear gloves . Tracy reached in her pocket , took out a pair of gloves , and put them on . Oh , God , I 'm doing it , she thought . I 'm really going ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no longer hear any other sounds . The alarm is to the left of the front door . There are five buttons . The red light will be on , which means the alarm is activated . The code to turn it off is three-two-four-one-one . When the red light goes off , you 'll know the alarm is deactivated . Here 's the key to the front door . When you enter , be sure to close the door after you . Use this flashlight . Do n't turn on any of the lights in the house in case someone happens to drive past . The master bedroom is upstairs , to your left , overlooking the bay . You 'll find the safe behind a portrait of Lois Bellamy . It 's a very simple safe . All you have to do is follow this combination . Tracy stood stock-still , trembling , ready to flee at the slightest sound . Silence . Slowly , she reached out and pressed the sequence of alarm buttons , praying that it would not work . The  | red light went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that airplane pilots had a phrase for it : the point of no return . Tracy put the key in the lock , and the door swung open . She waited a full minute before she stepped inside . Every nerve in her body throbbed to a savage beat as she stood in the hallway , listening , afraid to move . The house was filled with a deserted silence . She took out a flashlight , turned it on , and saw the staircase . She moved forward and started up . All she wanted to do now was get it over with as quickly as possible and run . The upstairs hallway looked eerie in the glow of her flashlight , and the wavering beam made the walls seem to pulse back and forth . Tracy peered into each room she passed . They were all empty . The master bedroom was at the end of the hallway , looking out over the bay , just as Morgan had described it . The bedroom was beautiful , done in dusky pink , with a canopied bed and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats , a fireplace , and a table in front of it for dining . I almost lived in a house like this with Charles and our baby , Tracy thought . She walked over to the picture window and looked out at the distant boats anchored in the bay . Tell me , God , what made you decide that Lois Bellamy should live in this beautiful house and that I should be here robbing it ? Come on , girl , she told herself , do n't get philosophical . This is a one-time thing . It will be over in a few minutes , but not if you stand here doing nothing . She turned from the window and walked over to the portrait Morgan had described . Lois Bellamy had a hard , arrogant look . It 's true . She does look like a horrible woman . The painting swung outward , away from the wall , and behind it was a small safe . Tracy had memorized the combination . Three turns to the right , stop at forty-two . Two turns to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop at thirty . llcr hands were trembling so much that she had to start over twice . She heard a click . The door was open . The safe was filled with thick envelopes and papers , but  | Tracy ignored them . At the back , resting on a small shelf , was a chamois jewelry bag . Tracy reached for it and lifted it from the shelf . At that instant the burglar alarm went off , and it was the loudest sound Tracy had ever heard . It seemed to reverberate from every corner of the house , screaming out its warning . She stood there , paralyzed , in shock . What had gone wrong ? Had Conrad Morgan not known about the alarm inside the safe that was activated when the jewels were removed ? She had to get out quickly . She scooped the chamois bag into her pocket and started running toward the stairs . And then , over the sound of the alarm , she heard another sound , the sound of an approaching siren . Tracy stood at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouth dry . She hurried to a window , raised the curtain , and peered out . A blackand-white patrol car was pulling up in front of the house . As Tracy watched , a uniformed policeman ran toward the back of the house , while a second one moved toward the front door . There was no escape . The alarm bells were still clanging , and suddenly they sounded like the terrible bells in the corridors of the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women . No ! thought Tracy . I wo n't let them send me back there . The front doorbell shrilled . Lieutenant Melvin Durkin had been on the Sea Cliff police force for ten years . Sea Cliff was a quiet town , and the main activity of the police was handling vandalism , a few car thefts , and occasional Saturday-night drunken brawls . The setting-off of the Bellamy alarm was in a different category . It was the type of criminal activity for which Lieutenant Durkin had joined the force . He knew Lois Bellamy and was aware of what a valuable collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had made it a point to check the house from time to time , for it was a tempting target for a cat burglar . And now , Lieutenant Durkin thought , it looks like I 've caught one . He had been only two blocks away when the radio call had come in from the security company . This is going to look good on my record . Damned good . Lieutenant Durkin pressed the front doorbell again . He  | wanted to be able to state in his report that he had rung it three times before making a forcible entry . His partner was covering the back , so there was no chance of the burglar 's escaping . He would probably try to conceal himself on the premises , but he was in for a surprise . No one could hide from Melvin Durkin . As the lieutenant reached for the bell for the third time , the front door suddenly opened . The policeman stood there staring . In the doorway was a woman dressed in a filmy nightgown that left little to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her hair was tucked into a curler cap . She demanded , " What on earth is going on ? " Lieutenant Durkin swallowed . " I . . . who are you ? " " I 'm Ellen Branch . I 'm a houseguest of Lois Bellamy 's . She 's away in Europe . " " I know that . " The lieutenant was confused . " She did n't tell us she was having a houseguest . " The woman in the doorway nodded knowingly . " Is n't that just like Lois ? Excuse me , I ca n't stand that noise . " As Lieutenant Durkin watched , Lois Bellamy 's houseguest reached over to the alarm buttons , pressed a sequence of numbers , and the sound stopped . " That 's better , " she sighed . " I ca n't tell you how glad I am to see you . " She laughed shakily . " I was just getting ready for bed when the alarm went off . I was sure there were burglars in the house , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do you mind if we look around ? " " Please , I insist ! " It took the lieutenant and his partner only a few minutes to make sure there was no one lurking on the premises . " All clear , " Lieutenant Durkin said . " False alarm . Something must have set it off . Ca n't always depend on these electronic things . I 'd call the security company and have them check out the system . " " I most certainly will . " " Well , guess we 'd better be running along , " the lieutenant said . " Thank you so much for coming bv . I feel much safer now . "  | She sure has a great body , Lieutenant Durkin thought . He wondered what she looked like under that mudpack and without the curler cap . " Will you be staying here long , Miss Branch ? " " Another week or two , until Lois returns . " " If there 's anything I can do for you , just let me know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the police car drove away into the night . She felt faint with relief . When the car was out of sight , she hurried upstairs , washed off the mudpack she had found in the bathroom , stripped off Lois Bellamy 's curler cap and nightgown , changed into her own black coveralls , and left by the front door , carefully resetting the alarm . It was not until Tracy was halfway back to Manhattan that the audacity of what she had done struck her . She giggled , and the giggle turned into a shaking , uncontrollable laughter , until she finally had to pull the car off onto the side of the road . She laughed until the tears streamed down her face . It was the first time she had laughed in a year . It felt wonderful .  | It was not until the Amtrak train pulled out of Pennsylvania Station that Tracy began to relax . At every second she had expected a heavy hand to grip her shoulder , a voice to say , " You 're under arrest . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , and there was nothing alarming about them . Still , Tracy 's shoulders were knots of tension . She kept assuring herself that it was unlikely anyone would have discovered the burglary this soon , and even if they had , there was nothing to connect her with it . Conrad Morgan would be waiting in St. Louis with $25,000 . Twenty-five thousand dollars to do with as she pleased ! She would have had to work at the bank for a year to earn that much money . I 'll travel to Europe , Tracy thought . Paris . No . Not Paris . Charles and I were going to honeymoon there . I 'll go to London . There , I wo n't be a jailbird . In a curious way , the experience she had just gone through had made Tracy feel like a different person . It was as though she had been reborn . She locked the door to the compartment and took out the chamois bag and opened it . A cascade of glittering colors spilled  | into her hands . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapphire bracelet , three pairs of earrings , and two necklaces , one of rubies , one of pearls . There must be more than a million dollars ' worth of jewelry here , Tracy marveled . As the train rolled through the countryside , she leaned back in her seat and replayed the evening in her mind . Renting the car . . . the drive to Sea Cliff . . . the stillness of the night . . . turning off the alarm and entering the house . . . opening the safe . . . the shock of the alarm going off , and the police appearing . It had never occurred to them that the woman in the nightgown with a mudpack on her face and a curler cap on her head was the burglar they were looking for . Now , seated in her compartment on the train to St. Louis , Tracy allowed herself a smile of satisfaction . She had enjoyed outwitting the police . There was something wonderfully exhilarating about being on the edge of danger . She felt daring and clever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock at ' the door of her compartment . Tracy hastily put the jewels back into the chamois bag and placed the bag in her suitcase . She took out her train ticket and unlocked the compartment door for the conductor . Two men in gray suits stood in the corridor . One appeared to be in his early thirties , the other one about ten years older . The younger man was attractive , with the build of an athlete . He had a strong chin , a small , neat mustache , and wore hornrimmed glasses behind which were intelligent blue eyes . The older man had a thick head of black hair and was heavy-set . His eyes were a cold brown . " Can I help you ? " Tracy asked . " Yes , ma'am , " the older man replied . He pulled out a wallet and held up an identification card : FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE " I 'm Special Agent Dennis Trevor . This is Special Agent Thomas Bowers . " Tracy 's mouth was suddenly dry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid I do n't understand . Is something wrong ' ? "  | " I 'm afraid there is , ma'am , " the younger agent said . He had a soft , southern accent . " A few minutes ago this train crossed into New Jersey . Transporting stolen merchandise across a state line is a federal offense . " Tracy felt suddenly faint . A red film appeared in front of her eyes , blurring everything . The older man , Dennis Trevor , was saying , " Would you open your luggage , please ? " It was not a question but an order . Her only hope was to try to bluff it out . " Of course I wo n't ! How dare you come barging into my compartment like this ! " Her voice was filled with indignation . " Is that all you have to do  --  go around bothering innocent citizens ? I 'm going to call the conductor . " " We 've already spoken to the conductor , " Trevor said . Her bluff was not working . " Do  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man said gently , " We do n't need a search warrant , Miss Whitney . We 're apprehending you during the commission of a crime . " They even knew her name . She was trapped . There was no way out . None . Trevor was at her suitcase , opening it . It was useless to try to stop him . Tracy watched as he reached inside and pulled out the chamois bag . He opened it , looked at his partner , and nodded . Tracy sank down onto the seat , suddenly too weak to stand . Trevor took a list from his pocket , checked the contents of the bag against the list , and put the bag in his pocket . " It 's all here , Tom . " " How  --  how did you find out ? " Tracy asked miserably . " We 're not permitted to give out any information , " Trevor replied . " You 're under arrest . You have the right to remain silent , and to have an attorney present before you say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Do you undersand ? " Her answer was a whispered , " Yes . " Tom Bowers said , " I 'm sorry about this . I mean , I know about your background , and I 'm really sorry . " " For Christ 's sake , " the older man said , " this is n't a social  | " I know , but still ? " The older man held out a pair of handcuffs to Tracy . " Hold out your wrists , please . " Tracy felt her heart twisting in agony . She remembered the airport in New Orleans when they had handcuffed her , the staring faces . " Please ! Do you  --  do you have to do that ? " " Yes , ma'am . " The younger man said , " Can I talk to you alone for a minute , Dennis ? " Dennis Trevor shrugged . " Okay . " The two men stepped outside into the corridor . Tracy sat there , dazed , filled with despair . She could hear snatches of their conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't necessary to put cuffs on her . She 's not going to run away . . . . " " When are you going to stop being such a boy scout ? When you 've been with the Bureau as long as I have . . . " " Come on . Give her a break . She 's embarrassed enough , and . . . " " That 's nothing to what she 's going to . . . " She could not hear the rest of the conversation . She did not want to hear the rest of the conversation . In a moment they returned to the compartment . The older man seemed angry . " All right , " he said . " We 're not cuffing you . We 're taking you off at the next station . We 're going to radio ahead for a Bureau car . You 're not to leave this compartment . Is that clear ? " Tracy nodded , too miserable to speak . The younger man , Tom Bowers , gave her a sympathetic shrug , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do . " There was nothing anyone could do . Not now . It was too late . She had been caught red-handed . Somehow the police had traced her and informed the FBI . The agents were outside in the corridor talking to the conductor . Bowers pointed to Tracy and said something she could not hear . The conductor nodded . Bowers closed the door of the compartment , and to Tracy , it was like a cell door slam-  | The countryside sped by , flashing vignettes briefly framed by the window , but Tracy was unaware of the scenery . She sat there , paralyzed by fear . There was a roaring in her ears that had nothing to do with the sounds of the train . She would get no second chance . She was a convicted felon . They would give her the maximum sentence , and this time there would be no warden 's daughter to rescue , there would be nothing but the deadly , endless years of prison facing her . And the Big Berthas . How had they caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Conrad Morgan , and he could have no possible reason to turn her and the jewelry over to the FBI . Possibly some clerk in his store had learned of the plan and tipped off the police . But how it happened made no difference . She had been caught . At the next stop she would be on her way to prison again . There would be a preliminary hearing and then the trial , and then . . . . Tracy squeezed her eyes tightly shut , refusing to think about it any further . She felt hot tears brush her cheeks . The train began to lose speed . Tracy started to hyperventilate . She could not get enough air . The two FBI agents would be coming for her at any moment . A station came into view , and a few seconds later the train jerked to a stop . It was time to go . Tracy closed her suitcase , put on her coat , and sat down . She stared at the closed compartment door , waiting for it to open . Minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What could they be doing ? She recalled their words : " We 're taking you off at the next station . We 're going to radio ahead for a Bureau car . You 're not to leave this compartment . " She heard the conductor call , " All aboard . . . . " Tracy started to panic . Perhaps they had meant they would wait for her on the platform . That must be it . If she stayed on the train , they would accuse her of trying to run away from them , and it would make things even worse . Tracy grabbed her suitcase , opened the compartment door , and hurried out into the corridor . The conductor was approaching . " Arc you getting off here , miss ? " he asked . " You 'd better hurry . Let me help you . A woman in your condition should n't be lifting things . "  | She stared . " In my condition ? " " You do n't have to be embarrassed . Your brothers told me you 're pregnant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My brothers ? ? " " Nice chaps . They seemed really concerned about you . " The world was spinning around . Everything was topsy-turvy . The conductor carried the suitcase to the end of the car and helped Tracy down the steps . The train began to move . " Do you know where my brothers went ? " Tracy called . " No , ma'am . They jumped into a taxi when the train stopped . " With a million dollars ' worth of stolen jewelry . Tracy headed for the airport . It was the only place she could think of . If the men had taken a taxi , it meant they did not have their own transportation , and they would surely want to get out of town as fast as possible . She sat back in the cab , filled with rage at what they had done to her and with shame at how easily they had conned her . Oh , they were good , both of them . Really good . They had been so convincing . She blushed to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad cop routine . For God 's sake , Dennis , it is n't necessary to put cuffs on her . She 's not going to run away . . . . When are you going to stop being such a boy scout ? When you 've been with the Bureau as long as I have . . . . The Bureau ? They were probably both fugitives from the law . Well , she was going to get those jewels back . She had gone through too much to be outwitted by two con artists . She had to get to the airport in time . She leaned forward in her seat and said to the driver , " Could you go faster , please ! " They were standing in the boarding line at the departure gate , and she did not recognize them immediately . The younger man , who had called himself Thomas Bowers , no longer wore glasses , his eyes had changed from blue to gray , and his mustache was gone . The other man , Dennis Trevor , who had had thick black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no  | mistaking them . They had not had time to change their clothes . They were almost at the boarding gate when Tracy reached them . " You forgot something , " Tracy said . They turned to look at her , startled . The younger man frowned . " What are you doing here ? A car from the Bureau was supposed to have been at the station to pick you up . " His southern accent was gone . " Then why do n't we go back and find it ? " Tracy suggested . " Ca n't . We 're on another case , " Trevor explained . " We have to catch this plane . " " Give me back the jewelry , first , " Tracy demanded . " I 'm afraid we ca n't do that , " Thomas Bowers told her . " It 's evidence . We 'll send you a receipt for it . " " No . I do n't want a receipt . I want the jewelry . " " Sorry , " said Trevor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They had reached the gate . Trevor handed his boarding pass to the attendant . Tracy looked around , desperate , and saw an airport policeman standing nearby . She called out , " Officer ! Officer ! " The two men looked at each other , startled . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " Trevor hissed . " Do you want to get us all arrested ? " The policeman was moving toward them . " Yes , miss ? Any problem ? " " Oh , no problem , " Tracy said gaily . " These two wonderful gentlemen found some valuable jewelry I lost , and they 're returning it to me . I was afraid I was going to have to go to the FBI about it . " The two men exchanged a frantic look . " They suggested that perhaps you would n't mind escorting me to a taxi . " " Certainly . Be happy to . " Tracy turned toward the men . " It 's safe to give the jewels to me now . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , really , " Tom Bowers objected . " It would be much better if we ? "  | " Oh , no , I insist , " Tracy urged . " I know how important it is for you to catch your plane . " The two men looked at the policeman , and then at each other , helpless . There was nothing they could do . Reluctantly , Tom Bowers pulled the chamois bag from his pocket . " That 's it ! " Tracy said . She took the bag from his hand , opened it , and looked inside . " Thank goodness . It 's all here . " Tom Bowers made one last-ditch try . " Why do n't we keep it safe for you until ? " " That wo n't be necessary , " Tracy said cheerfully . She opened her purse , put the jewelry inside , and took out two $5.00 bills . She handed one to each of the men . " Here 's a little token of my appreciation for what you 've done . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline attendant said , " That was the last call . You 'll have to board now , gentlemen . " " Thank you again , " Tracy beamed as she walked away with the policeman at her side . " It 's so rare to find an honest person these days . "  | Thomas Bowers  --  ne Jeff Stevens  --  sat at the plane window looking out as the aircraft took off . He raised his handkerchief to his eyes , and his shoulders heaved up and down . Dennis Trevor  --  a.k.a . Brandon Higgins  --  seated next to him , looked at him in surprise . " Hey , " he said , " it 's only money . It 's nothing to cry about . " Jeff Stevens turned to him with tears streaming down his face , and Higgins , to his astonishment , saw that Jeff was convulsed with laughter . " What the hell 's the matter with you ? " Higgins demanded . " It 's nothing to laugh about , either . " To Jeff , it was . The manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most ingenius con he had ever witnessed . A scam on top of a scam . Conrad Morgan had told them the woman was an amateur . My God , Jeff thought , what would she be like if she were a professional ? Tracy Whitney was without doubt the most beautiful woman Jeff Stevens had ever seen . And clever . Jeff prided himself on being the best confidence artist in the business , and she had  | outsmarted him . Uncle Willie would have loved her , Jeff thought . It was Uncle Willie who had educated Jeff . Jeff 's mother was the trusting heiress to a farm-equipment fortune , married to an improvident schemer filled with get-rich-quick projects that never quite worked out . Jeff 's father was a charmer , darkly handsome and persuasively glib , and in the first five years of marriage he had managed to run through his wife 's inheritance . Jeff 's earliest memories were of his mother and father quarreling about money and his father 's extramarital affairs . It was a bitter marriage , and the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . Never . His father 's brother , Uncle Willie , owned a small traveling carnival , and whenever he was near Marion , Ohio , where the Stevenses lived , he came to visit them . He was the most cheerful man Jeff had ever known , filled with optimism and promises of a rosy tomorrow . He always managed to bring the boy exciting gifts , and he taught Jeff wonderful magic tricks . Uncle Willie had started out as a magician at a carnival and had taken it over when it went broke . When Jeff was fourteen , his mother died in an automobile accident . Two months later Jeff 's father married a nineteenyear-old cocktail waitress . " It is n't natural for a man to live by himself , " his father had explained . But the boy was filled with a deep resentment , feeling betrayed by his father 's callousness . Jeff 's father had been hired as a siding salesman and was on the road three days a week . One night when Jeff was alone in the house with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom door opening . Moments later he felt a soft , naked body next to his . Jeff sat up in alarm . " Hold me , Jeffie , " his stepmother whispered . " I 'm afraid of thunder . " " It  --  it is n't thundering , " Jeff stammered . " But it could be . The paper said rain . " She pressed her body close to his . " Make love to me , baby . " The boy was in a panic . " Sure . ( ' an we do it in Dad 's bed ? " " Okay . " She laughed . " Kinky , huh ' "  | " I 'll be right there , " Jeff promised . She slid out of bed and went into the other bedroom . Jeff had never dressed faster in his life . He went out the window and headed for Cimarron , Kansas , where Uncle Willie 's carnival was playing . He never looked back . When Uncle Willie asked Jeff why he had run away from home , all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my stepmother . " Uncle Willie telephoned Jeff 's father , and after a long conversation , it was decided that the boy should remain with the carnival . " He 'll get a better education here than any school could ever give him , " Uncle Willie promised . The carnival was a world unto itself . " We do n't run a Sunday school show , " Uncle Willie explained to Jeff . " We 're flimflam artists . But remember , sonny , you ca n't con people unless they 're greedy to begin with . W. C. Fields had it right . You ca n't cheat an honest man . " The carnies became Jeff 's friends . There were the " frontend " men , who had the concessions , and the " back-end " people , who ran shows like the fat woman and the tattooed lady , and the flat-store operators , who operated the games . The carnival had its share of nubile girls , and they were attracted to the young boy . Jeff had inherited his mother 's sensitivity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies fought over who was going to relieve Jeff of his virginity . His first sexual experience was with a pretty contortionist , and for years she was the high-water mark that other women had to live up to . Uncle Willie arranged for Jeff to work at various jobs around the carnival . " Someday all this will be yours , " Uncle Willie told the boy , " and the only way you 're gon na hang on to it is to know more about it than anybody else does . " Jeff started out with the six-cat " hanky-pank , " a scam where customers paid to throw balls to try to knock six cats made out of canvas with a wood-base bottom into a net . The operator running the joint would demonstrate how easy it was to knock them over , but when the customer tried it , a " gunner " hiding in back of the canvas lifted a rod to keep the wooden  | base on the cats steady . Not even Sandy Koufax could have downed the cats . " Hey , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All you have to do is hit it nice and easy . " Nice and easy was the password , and the moment the operator said it , the hidden gunner would drop the rod , and the operator would knock the cat off the board . He would then say , " See what I mean ? " and that was the gunner 's signal to put up the rod again . There was always another rube who wanted to show off his pitching arm to his giggling girl friend . Jeff worked the " count stores , " where clothespins were arranged in a line . The customer would pay to throw rubber rings over the clothespins , which were numbered , and if the total added up to twenty-nine , he would win an expensive toy . What the sucker did not know was that the clothespins had different numbers at both ends , so that the man running the count store could conceal the number that would add up to twenty-nine and make sure the mark never won . One day Uncle Willie said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid , and I 'm proud of you . You 're ready to move up to the skillo . " The skillo operators were the creme de la creme , and all the other carnies looked up to them . They made more money than anyone else in the carnival , stayed at the best hotels , and drove flashy cars . The skillo game consisted of a flat wheel with an arrow balanced very carefully on glass with a thin piece of paper in the center . Each section was numbered , and when the customer spun the wheel and it stopped on a number , that number would be blocked off . The customer would pay again for another spin of the wheel , and another space would be blocked off . The skillo operator explained that when all the spaces were blocked off , the customer would win a large sum of money . As the customer got closer to filling in all the spaces , the skillo operator would encourage him to increase his bets . The operator would look around nervously and whisper , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to win . If you do , maybe you 'll give me a small piece . " The operator would slip the customer five or ten dollars and say , " Bet this for me , will you ? You ca n't lose now . " And  | the mark would feel as though he had a confederate . Jeff became an expert at milking the customers . As the open spaces on the board became smaller and the odds of winning grew greater , the excitement would intensify . " You ca n't miss now ! " Jeff would exclaim , and the player would eagerly put up more money . Finally , when there was only one tiny space left to fill , the excitement would peak . The mark would put up all the money he had , and often hurry home to get more . The customer never won , however , because the operator or his shill would give the table an imperceptible nudge , and the arrow would invariably land at the wrong place . Jeff quickly learned all the carnie terms : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the marks could not win . The men who stood in front of a sideshow making their spiel were called " barkers " by outsiders , but the carnie people called them " talkers . " The talker got 10 percent of the take for building the tip  --  the " tip " being a crowd . " Slum " was the prize given away . The " postman " was a cop who had to be paid off . Jeff became an expert at the " blow-off . " When customers paid to see a sideshow exhibition , Jeff would make his spiel : " Ladies and gentlemen : Everything that 's pictured , painted , and advertised outside , you will see within the walls of this tent for the price of your general admission . However , immediately after the young lady in the electric chair gets finished being tortured , her poor body racked by fifty thousand watts of electricity , we have an extra added attraction that has absolutely nothing to do with the show and is not advertised outside . Behind this enclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so chilling and hair-raising , that we dare not portray it outside , because it might come under the eyes of innocent children or susceptible women . " And after the suckers had paid an extra dollar , Jeff would usher them inside to see a girl with no middle , or a two-headed baby , and of course it was all done with mirrors . One of the most profitable carnival games was the " mouse running . " A live mouse was put in the center of a table and a bowl was placed over it . The rim of the table had ten holes around its perimeter into any one of which the mouse could  | run when the bowl was lifted . Each patron bet on a numbered hole . Whomever selected the hole into which the mouse would run won the prize . " How do you gaff a thing like that ? " Jeff asked Uncle Willie . " Do you use trained mice ? " Uncle Willie roared with laughter . " Who the hell 's got time to train mice ? No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number no one has bet on , and he puts a little vinegar on his finger and touches the edge of the hole he wants the mouse to run into . The mouse will head for that hole every time . " Karen , an attractive young belly dancer , introduced Jeff to the " key " game . " When you 've made your spiel on Saturday night , " Karen told him , " call some of the men customers aside , one at a time , and sell then a key to my trailer . " The keys cost five dollars . By midnight , a dozen or more men would find themselves milling around outside her trailer . Karen , by that time , was at a hotel in town , spending the night with Jeff . When the marks came back to the carnival the following morning to get their revenge , the show was long gone . During the next four years Jeff learned a great deal about human nature . He found out how easy it was to arouse greed , and how guillible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed made them want to believe . At eighteen , Jeff was strikingly handsome . Even the most casual woman observer would instantly note and approve his gray , well-spaced eyes , tall build , and curly dark hair . Men enjoyed his wit and air of easy good humor . Even children , as if speaking to some answering child in him , gave him their confidence immediately . Customers flirted outrageously with Jeff , but Uncle Willie cautioned , " Stay away from the townies , my boy . Their fathers are always the sheriff . " It was the knife thrower 's wife who caused Jeff to leave the carnival . The show had just arrived in Milledgeville , Georgia , and the tents were being set up . A new act had signed on , a Sicilian knife thrower called the Great Zorbini and his attrac-  | tive blond wife . While the Great Zorbini was at the carnival setting up his equipment , his wife invited Jeff to their hotel room in town . " Zorbini will be busy all day , " she told Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded good . " Give me an hour and then come up to the room , " she said . " Why wait an hour ? " Jeff asked . She smiled and said , " It will take me that long to get everything ready . " Jeff waited , his curiosity increasing , and when he finally arrived at the hotel room , she greeted him at the door , stark naked . He reached for her , but she took his hand and said , " Come in here . " He walked into the bathroom and stared in disbelief . She had filled the bathtub with six flavors of Jell-O , mixed with warm water . " What 's that ? " Jeff asked . " It 's dessert . Get undressed , baby . " Jeff undressed . " Now , into the tub . " He stepped into the tub and sat down , and it was the wildest sensation he had ever experienced . The soft , slippery JellO seemed to fill every crevice of his body , massaging him all over . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " lunch . " She started down his chest toward his groin , licking the JellO as she went . " Mmmm , you taste delicious . I like the strawberry best . . . . " Between her rapidly flicking tongue and the friction of the warm , viscous Jell-O , it was an erotic experience beyond description . In the middle of it , the bathroom door flew open and the Great Zorbini strode in . The Sicilian took one look at his wife and the startled Jeff , and howled , " Tu sei una puttana ! Vi ammazzo tutti e due ! Dove sono i midi coltelli ? " Jeff did not recognize any of the words , but the tone was familiar . As the Great Zorbini raced out of the room to get his knives , Jeff leaped out of the tub , his body looking like a rainbow with the multicolored Jell-O clinging to it , and grabbed  | his clothes . He jumped out of the window , naked , and began running down the alley . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . Zing ! Another , and then he was out of range . He dressed in a culvert , pulling his shirt and pants over the sticky Jell-O , and squished his way to the depot , where he caught the first bus out of town . Six months later , he was in Vietnam . Every soldier fights a different war , and Jeff came out of his Vietnam experience with a deep contempt for bureaucracy and a lasting resentment of authority . He spent two years in a war that could never be won , and he was appalled by the waste of money and materiel and lives , and sickened by the treachery and deceit of the generals and politicians who performed their verbal sleight of hand . We 've been suckered into a war that nobody wants , Jeff thought . It 's a con game . The biggest con game in the world . A week before Jeff 's discharge , he received the news of Uncle Willie 's death . The carnival had folded . The past was finished . It was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed were filled with a series of adventures . To Jeff , the whole world was a carnival , and the people in it were his marks . He devised his own con games . He placed ads in newspapers offering a color picture of the President for a dollar . When he received a dollar , he sent his victim a postage stamp with a picture of the President on it . He put announcements in magazines warning the public that there were only sixty days left to send in five dollars , that after that it would be too late . The ad did not specify what the five dollars would buy , but the money poured in . For three months Jeff worked in a boiler room , selling phony oil stocks over the telephone . He loved boats , and when a friend offered him a job working on a sailing schooner bound for Tahiti , Jeff signed on as a seaman . The ship was a beauty , a 165-foot white schooner , glistening in the sun , all sails drawing well . It had teak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a main salon that sat  | twelve and a galley forward , with electric ovens . The crew 's quarters were in the forepeak . In addition to the captain , the steward , and a cook , there were five deckhands . Jeff 's job consisted of helping hoist the sails , polishing the brass portholes , and climbing up the ratlines to the lower spreader to mast the sails . The schooner was carrying a party of eight . " The owner is named Hollander , " Jeff 's friend informed him . Hollander turned out to be Louise Hollander , a twenty-fiveyear-old , golden-haired beauty , whose father owned half of Central America . The other passengers were her friends , whom Jeff 's buddies sneeringly referred to as the " jest set . " The first day out Jeff was working in the hot sun , polishing the brass on deck . Louise Hollander stopped beside him . " You 're new on board . " He looked up . " Yes . " " Do you have a name ? " " Jeff Stevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made no comment . " Do you know who I am ? " " No . " " I 'm Louise Hollander . I own this boat . " " I see . I 'm working for you . " She gave him a slow smile . " That 's right . " " Then if you want to get your money 's worth , you 'd better let me get on with my work . " Jeff moved on to the next stanchion . In their quarters at night , the crew members disparaged the passengers and made jokes about them . But Jeff admitted to himself that he was envious of them  --  their backgrounds , their educations , and their easy manners . They had come from monied families and had attended the best schools . His school had been Uncle Willie and the carnival . One of the carnies had been a professor of archaeology until he was thrown out of college for stealing and selling valuable relics . He and Jeff had had long talks , and the professor had imbued Jeff with an enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind in the past , " the professor  | would say . " Think of it , son . Thousands of years ago there were people just like you and me dreaming dreams , spinning tales , living out their lives , giving birth to our ancestors . " His eyes had taken on a faraway look . " Carthage  --  that 's where I 'd like to go on a dig . Long before Christ was born , it was a great city , the Paris of ancient Africa . The people had their games , and baths , and chariot racing . The Circus Maximus was as large as five football fields . " He had noted the interest in the boy 's eyes . " Do you know how Cato the Elder used to end his speeches in the Roman Senate ? He 'd say , Delenda est cartaga ' ; Carthage must be destroyed . ' His wish finally came true . The Romans reduced the place to rubble and came back twenty-five years later to build a great city on its ashes . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my boy . " A year later the professor had died of alcoholism , but Jeff had promised himself that one day he would go on a dig . Carthage , first , for the professor . On the last night before the schooner was to dock in Tahiti , Jeff was summoned to Louise Hollander 's stateroom . She was wearing a sheer silk robe . " You wanted to see me , ma'am ? " " Are you a homosexual , Jeff ? " " I do n't believe it 's any of your business , Miss Hollander , but the answer is no . What I am is choosy . " Louise Hollander 's mouth tightened . " What kind of women do you like ? Whores , I suppose . " " Sometimes , " Jeff said agreeably . " Was there anything else , Miss Hollander ? " " Yes . I 'm giving a dinner party tomorrow night . Would you like to come ? " Jeff looked at the woman for a long moment before he answered . " Why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had two husbands before she was twenty-one , and her lawyer had just made a settlement with her third husband when she met Jeff . The second night they  | were moored at the harbor in Papeete , and as the passengers and crew were going ashore , Jeff received another summons to Louise Hollander 's quarters . When Jeff arrived , she was dressed in a colorful silk pareu slit all the way up to the thigh . " I 'm trying to get this off , " she said . " I 'm having a problem with the zipper . " Jeff walked over and examined the costume . " It does n't have a zipper . " She turned to face him , and smiled . " I know . That 's my problem . " They made love on the deck , where the soft tropical air caressed their bodies like a blessing . Afterward , they lay on their sides , facing each other . Jeff propped himself up on an elbow and looked down at Louise . " Your daddy 's not the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in surprise . " What ? " " You 're the first townie I ever made love to . Uncle Willie used to warn me that their daddies always turned out to be the sheriff . " They were together every night after that . At first Louise 's friends were amused . He 's another one of Louise 's playthings , they thought . But when she informed them that she intended to marry Jeff , they were frantic . " For Christ 's sake , Louise , he 's a nothing . He worked in a carnival . My God , you might as well be marrying a stable hand . He 's handsome  --  granted . And he has a fab bod . But outside of sex , you have absolutely nothing in common , darling . " " Louise , Jeff 's for breakfast , not dinner . " " You have a social position to uphold . " " Frankly , angel , he just wo n't fit in , will he ? " But nothing her friends said could dissuade Louise . Jeff was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found that men who were outstandingly handsome were either monumentally stupid or unbearably dull . Jeff was intelligent and amusing , and the combination was irresistible . When Louise mentioned the subject of marriage to Jeff , he was as surprised as her friends had been . " Why marriage ? You 've already got my body . I ca n't give you anything you do n't have . "  | " It 's very simple , Jeff . I love you . I want to share the rest of my life with you . " Marriage had been an alien idea , and suddenly it no longer was . Beneath Louise Hollander 's worldly , sophisticated veneer , there was a vulnerable , lost little girl . She needs me , Jeff thought . The idea of a stable homelife and children was suddenly immensely appealing . It seemed to him that ever since he could remember , he had been running . It was time to stop . They were married in the town hall in Tahiti three days later . When they returned to New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louise Hollander 's attorney , a small , frigid man , tight-lipped and probably , Jeff thought , tightassed . " I have a paper here for you to sign , " the attorney announced . " What kind of paper ? " " It 's a release . It simply states that in the event of the dissolution of your marriage to Louise Hollander ? " " Louise Stevens . " " ? Louise Stevens , that you will not participate financially in any of her ? " Jeff felt the muscles of his jaw tightening . " Where do I sign ? " " Do n't you want me to finish reading ? " " No . I do n't think you get the point . I did n't marry her for her fucking money . " " Really , Mr. Stevens ! I just ? " " Do you want me to sign it or do n't you ? " The lawyer placed the paper in front of Jeff . He scrawled his signature and stormed out of the office . Louise 's limousine and driver were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to laugh to himself . What the hell am I so pissed off about ? I 've been a con artist all my life , and when I go straight for the first time and someone thinks I 'm out to take them , I behave like a fucking Sunday school teacher . Louise took Jeff to the best tailor in Manhattan . " You 'll look fantastic in a dinner jacket , " she coaxed . And he did . Before the second month of the marriage , five of Louise 's best friends  | had tried to seduce the attractive newcomer in their circle , but Jeff ignored them . He was determined to make his marriage work . Budge Hollander , Louise 's brother , put Jeff up for membership in the exclusive New York Pilgrim Club , and Jeff was accepted . Budge was a beefy , middle-aged man who had gotten his sobriquet playing right tackle on the Harvard football team , where he got the reputation of being a player his opponents could not budge . He owned a shipping line , a banana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more corporations than Jeff could count . Budge Hollander was not subtle in concealing his contempt for Jeff Stevens . " You 're really out of our class , are n't you , old boy ? But as long as you amuse Louise in bed , that will do nicely . I 'm very fond of my sister . " It took every ounce of willpower for Jeff to control himself . I 'm not married to this prick . I 'm married to Louise . The other members of the Pilgrim Club were equally obnoxious . They found Jeff terribly amusing . All of them dined at the club every noontime , and pleaded for Jeff to tell them stories about his " carnie days , " as they liked to call them . Perversely , Jeff made the stories more and more outrageous . Jeff and Louise lived in a twenty-room townhouse filled with servants , on the East Side of Manhattan . Louise had estates in Long Island and the Bahamas , a villa in Sardinia , and a large apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris . Aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolls Corniche , a Lamborghini , and a Daimler . It 's fantastic , Jeff thought . It 's great , Jeff thought . It 's boring , Jeff thought . And degrading . One morning he got up from his eighteenth-century fourposter bed , put on a Sulka robe , and went looking for Louise . He found her in the breakfast room . " I 've got to get a job , " he told her . " For heaven 's sake , darling , why ? We do n't need the money . " " It has nothing to do with money . You ca n't expect me to  | sit around on my hands and be spoon-fed . I have to work . " Louise gave it a moment 's thought . " All right , angel . I 'll speak to Budge . He owns a stockbrokerage firm . Would you like to be a stockbroker , darling ? " " I just want to get off my ass , " Jeff muttered . He went to work for Budge . He had never had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love it , Jeff thought . He hated it . He stayed with it because he wanted to bring home a paycheck to his wife . " When are you and I going to have a baby ? " he asked Louise , after a lazy Sunday brunch . " Soon , darling . I 'm trying . " " Come to bed . Let 's try again . " Jeff was seated at the luncheon table reserved for his brotherin-law and half a dozen other captains of industry at the Pilgrim Club . Budge announced , " We just issued our annual report for the meat-packing company , fellas . Our profits are up forty percent . " " Why should n't they be ? " one of the men at the table laughed . " You 've got the fucking inspectors bribed . " He turned to the others at the table . " Old clever Budge , here , buys inferior meat and has it stamped prime and sells it for a bloody fortune . " Jeff was shocked . " People eat meat , for Christ 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kidding , is n't he , Budge ? " Budge grinned and whooped , " Look who 's being moral ! " Over the next three months Jeff became very well acquainted with his table companions . Ed Zeller had paid a million in bribes in order to build a factory in Libya . Mike Quincy , the head of a conglomerate , was a raider who bought companies and illegally tipped off his friends when to buy and sell the stock . Alan Thompson , the richest man at the table , boasted of his company 's policy . " Before they changed the damn law , we used to fire the old gray hairs one year before their pensions were due . Saved a fortune . "  | All the men cheated on taxes , had insurance scams , falsified expense accounts , and put their current mistresses on their payrolls as secretaries or assistants . Christ , Jeff thought . They 're just dressed-up carnies . They all run flat stores . The wives were no better . They grabbed everything they could get their greedy hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key game , Jeff marveled . When he tried to tell Louise how he felt , she laughed . " Do n't be naive , Jeff . You 're enjoying your life , are n't you ? " The truth was that he was not . He had married Louise because he believed she needed him . He felt that children would change everything . " Let 's have one of each . It 's time . We 've been married a year now . " " Angel , be patient . I 've been to the doctor , and he told me I 'm fine . Maybe you should have a checkup and see if you 're all right . " Jeff went . " You should have no trouble producing healthy children , " the doctor assured him . And still nothing happened . On Black Monday Jeff 's world fell apart . It started in the morning when he went into Louise 's medicine chest for an aspirin . He found a shelf full of birth control pills . One of the cases was almost empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder and a small golden spoon . And that was only the start of the day . At noon , Jeff was seated in a deep armchair in the Pilgrim Club , waiting for Budge to appear , when he heard two men behind him talking . " She swears that her Italian singer 's cock is over ten inches long . " There was a snicker . " Well , Louise always liked them big . " They 're talking about another Louise , Jeff told himself . " That 's probably why she married that carnival person in the first place . But she does tell the most amusing stories about him . " You wo n't believe what he did the other day . . . "  | Jeff rose and blindly made his way out of the club . He was filled with a rage such as he had never known . He wanted to kill . He wanted to kill the unknown Italian . He wanted to kill Louise . How many other men had she been sleeping with during the past year ? They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Zeller and Mike Quincy and Alan Thompson and their wives had been having an enormous joke at his expense . And Louise , the woman he had wanted to protect . Jeff 's immediate reaction was to pack up and leave . But that was not good enough . He had no intention of letting the bastards have the last laugh . That afternoon when Jeff arrived home , Louise was not there . " Madame went out this morning , " Pickens , the butler , said . " I believe she had several appointments . " I 'll bet she did , Jeff thought . She 's out fucking that ten-inchcock Italian . Jesus Christ ! By the time Louise arrived home , Jeff had himself under tight control . " Did you have a nice day ? " Jeff asked . " Oh , the usual boring things , darling . A beauty appointment , shopping . . . . How was your day , angel ? " " It was interesting , " Jeff said truthfully . " I learned a lot . " " Budge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , " Jeff assured her . " And very soon I 'm going to be +doing even better . " Louise stroked his hand . " My bright husband . Why do n't we go to bed early ? " " Not tonight , " Jeff said . " I have a headache . " He spent the next week making his plans . He began at lunch at the club . " Do any of you know anything about computer frauds ? " Jeff asked . " Why ? " Ed Zeller wanted to know . " You planning to commit one ? " There was a sputter of laughter . " No , I 'm serious , " Jeff insisted . " It 's a big problem . People are tapping into computers and ripping off banks and insurance companies and other businesses for billions of dollars . It gets worse all the time . " " Sounds right up your alley , " Budge murmured .  | " Someone I met has come up with a computer he says ca n't be tampered with . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Quincy kidded . " As a matter of fact , I 'm interested in raising money to back him . I just wondered if any of you might know something about computers . " " No , " Budge grinned , " but we know everything about backing inventors , do n't we fellas ? " There was a burst of laughter . Two days later at the club , Jeff passed by the usual table and explained to Budge , " I 'm sorry I wo n't be able to join you fellows today . I 'm having a guest for lunch . " When Jeff moved on to another table , Alan Thompson grinned , " He 's probably having lunch with the bearded lady from the circus . " A stooped , gray-haired man entered the dining room and was ushered to Jeff 's table . " Jesus ! " Mike Quincy said . " Is n't that Professor Acker-man ? " " Who 's Professor Ackerman ? " " Do n't you ever read anything but financial reports , Budge ? Vernon Ackerman was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's National Scientific Board . He 's the most brilliant scientist in the country . " " What the hell is he doing with my dear brother-in-law ? " Jeff and the professor were engrossed in a deep conversation all during lunch , and Budge and his friends grew more and more curious . When the professor left , Budge motioned Jeff over to his table . " Hey , Jeff . Who was that ? " Jeff looked guilty . " Oh . . . you mean Vernon ? " " Yeah . What were you two talking about ? " " We . . . ah . . . " The others could almost watch Jeff 's thought processes as he tried to dodge the question . " I . . . ah . . . might write a book about him . He 's a very interesting character . " " I did n't know you were a writer . " " Well , I guess we all have to start sometime . "  | Three days later Jeff had another luncheon guest . This time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's Seymour Jarrett , chairman of the board of Jarrett International Computer . What the hell would he be doing with Jeff ? " Again , Jeff and his guest held a long , animated conversation . When the luncheon was over , Budge sought Jeff out . " Jeffrey , boy , what 's with you and Seymour Jarrett ? " " Nothing , " Jeff said quickly . " Just having a chat . " He started to walk away . Budge stopped him . " Not so fast , old buddy . Seymour Jarrett is a very busy fellow . He does n't sit around having long chats about nothing . " Jeff said earnestly , " All right . The truth is , Budge , that Seymour collects stamps , and I told him about a stamp I might be able to acquire for him . " The truth , my ass , Budge thought . The following week , Jeff lunched at the club with Charles Bartlett , the president of Bartlett &; Bartlett , one of the largest private capital venture groups in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mike Quincy watched in fascination as the two men talked , their heads close together . " Your brother-in-law is sure in high-flying company lately , " Zeller commented . " What kind of deal has he got cooking , Budge ? " Budge said testily , " I do n't know , but I 'm sure in hell going to find out . If Jarrett and Bartlett are interested , there must be a pot of money involved . " They watched as Bartlett rose , enthusiastically pumped Jeff 's hand , and left . As Jeff passed their table , Budge caught his arm . " Sit down , Jeff . We want to have a little talk with you . " " I should get back to the office , " Jeff protested . " I ? " " You work for me , remember ? Sit down . " Jeff sat . " Who were you having lunch with ? " Jeff hesitated . " No one special . An old friend . " " Charlie I3artlett 's an old friend ? " " Kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie discussing , Jeff ' ? "  | " Uh . . . cars , mostly . Old Charlie likes antique cars , and I heard about this ' 37 Packard , four-door convertible ? " " Cut the horseshit ! " Budge snapped . " You 're not collecting stamps or selling automobiles , or writing any fucking book . What are you really up to ? " " Nothing . I ? " " You 're raising money for something , are n't you , Jeff ? " Ed Zeller asked . " No ! " But he said it a shade too quickly . Budge put a beefy arm around Jeff . " Hey , buddy , this is your brother-in-law . We 're family , remember ? " He gave Jeff a bear hug . " It 's something about that tamper-proof computer you mentioned last week , right ? " They could see by the look on Jeff 's face that they had trapped him . " Well , yes . " It was like pulling teeth to get anything out of the son of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ackerman was in-volved ? " " I did n't think you 'd be interested . " " You were wrong . When you need capital , you go to your friends . " " The professor and I do n't need capital , " Jeff said . " Jarrett and Bartlett ? " " Jarrett and Bartlett are fuckin ' sharks ! They 'll eat you alive , " Alan Thompson exclaimed . Ed Zeller picked it up . " Jeff , when you deal with friends , you do n't get hurt . " " Everything is already arranged , " Jeff told them . " Charlie Bartlett ? " " Have you signed anything yet ? " " No , but I gave my word ? " " Then nothing 's arranged . Hell , Jeff boy , in business people change their minds every hour . " " I should n't even be discussing this with you , " Jeff protested . " Professor Ackerman 's name ca n't he mentioned . He 's under contract to a government agency . " " We know that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knows it works . " " If it 's good enough for Ackerman , it 's good enough for us , right fellows ? " There was a chorus of assent . " Hey , I 'm not a scientist , " Jeff said . " I ca n't guarantee anything . For all I know , this thing may have no value at all . " " Sure . We understand . But say it does have a value , Jeff . How big could this thing be ? " " Budge , the market for this is worldwide . I could n't even begin to put a value on it . Everybody will be able to use it . " " How much initial financing are you looking for ? " " Two million dollars , but all we need is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars down . Bartlett promised ? " " Forget Bartlett . That 's chicken feed , old buddy . We 'll put that up ourselves . Keep it in the family . Right , fellas ? " " Right ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain came hurrying over to the table . " Dominick , bring Mr. Stevens some paper and a pen . " It was produced almost instantly . " We can wrap up this little deal right here , " Budge said to Jeff . " You just make out this paper , giving us the rights , and we 'll all sign it , and in the morning you 'll have a certified check for two hundred fifty thousand dollars . How does that suit you ? " Jeff was biting his lower lip . " Budge , I promised Mr. Bart-lett ? " " Fuck Bartlett , " Budge snarled . " Are you married to his sister or mine ? Now write . " " We do n't have a patent on this , and ? " " Write , goddamn it ! " Budge shoved the pen in Jeff 's hand . Reluctantly , Jeff began to write : " This will transfer all my rights , title , and interest to a mathematical computer called SUCABA , to the buyers , Donald Budge ' Hollander , Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consideration of two million dollars , with a payment of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on signing .

" They were all looking over Jeff 's shoulder as he wrote . " Jesus ! " Ed Zeller said . " Ten years ! There 's not a computer on the market that can claim that ! " Jeff continued . " The buyers understand that neither Professor Vernon Ackerman nor I holds a patent on SUCABA ? " " We 'll take care of all that , " Alan Thompson interrupted impatiently . " I 've got one hell of a patent attorney . " Jeff kept writing . " I have explained to the buyers that SUCABA may have no value of any kind , and that neither Professor Vernon Ackerman nor I makes any representations or warranties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and held up the paper . " Is that satisfactory ? " " You sure about the ten years ? " Budge asked . " Guaranteed . I 'll just make a copy of this , " Jeff said . They watched as he carefully made a copy of what he had written . Budge snatched the papers out of Jeff 's hand and signed them . Zeller , Quincy , and Thompson followed suit . Budge was beaming . " A copy for us and a copy for you . Old Seymour Jarrett and Charlie Bartlett are sure going to have egg on their faces , huh , boys ? I ca n't wait until they hear that they got screwed out of this deal . " The following morning Budge handed Jeff a certified check for $250,000 . " Where 's the computer ? " Budge asked . " I arranged for it to be delivered here at the club at noon . I thought it only fitting that we should all be together when you receive it . " Budge clapped him on the shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See you at lunch . " At the stroke of noon a messenger carrying a box appeared in the dining room of the Pilgrim Club and was ushered to Budge 's table , where he was seated with Zeller , Thompson , and Quincy . " Here it is ! " Budge exclaimed . " Jesus ! The damned thing 's even portable ! " " Should we wait for Jeff ? " Thompson asked . " Fuck him . This belongs to us now . " Budge ripped the pa-  | per away from the box . Inside was a nest of straw . Carefully , almost reverently , he lifted out the object that lay in the nest . The men sat there , staring at it . It was a square frame about a foot in diameter , holding a series of wires across which were strung rows of beads . There was a long silence . " What is it ? " Quincy finally asked . Alan Thompson said , " It 's an abacus . One of those things Orientals use to count ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUCABA is abacus spelled backward ! " He turned to Budge . " Is this some kind of joke ? " Zeller was sputtering . " Low power , trouble-free , uses less power than any computer currently on the market . . . Stop the goddamned check ! " There was a concerted rush to the telephone . " Your certified check ? " the head bookkeeper said . " There 's nothing to worry about . Mr. Stevens cashed it this morning . " Pickens , the butler , was very sorry , indeed , but Mr. Stevens had packed and left . " He mentioned something about an extended journey . " That afternoon , a frantic Budge finally managed to reach Professor Vernon Ackerman . " Of course . Jeff Stevens . A charming man . Your brotherin-law , you say ? " " Professor , what were you and Jeff discussing ? " " I suppose it 's no secret . Jeff is eager to write a book about me . He has convinced me that the world wants to know the human being behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why do you want to know what Mr. Stevens and I discussed ? Are you a rival stamp col-lector ? " " No , I ? " " Well , it wo n't do you any good to snoop around . There 's only one stamp like it in existence , and Mr. Stevens has agreed to sell it to me when he acquires it . " And he slammed down the receiver .  | Budge knew what Charlie Bartlett was going to say before the words were out . " Jeff Stevens ? Oh , yes . I collect antique cars . Jeff knows where this ' 37 Packard four-door convertible in mint condition ? " This time it was Budge who hung up . " Do n't worry , " Budge told his partners . " We 'll get our money back and put the son of a bitch away for the rest of his life . There are laws against fraud . " The group 's next stop was at the office of Scott Fogarty . " He took us for two hundred fifty thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him put behind bars for the rest of his life . Get a warrant out for ? " " Do you have the contract with you , Budge ? " " It 's right here . " He handed Fogarty the paper Jeff had written out . The lawyer scanned it quickly , then read it again , slowly . " Did he forge your names to this paper ? " " Why , no , " Mike Quincy said . " We signed it . " " Did you read it first ? " Ed Zeller angrily said , " Of course we read it . Do you think we 're stupid ? " " I 'll let you be the judge of that , gentlemen . You signed a contract stating that you were informed that what you were purchasing with a down payment of two hundred fifty thousand dollars was an object that had not been patented and could be completely worthless . In the legal parlance of an old professor of mine , You 've been royally fucked . ' " Jeff had obtained the divorce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had run into Conrad Morgan . Morgan had once worked for Uncle Willie . " How would you like to do me a small favor , Jeff ? " Conrad Morgan had asked . " There 's a young lady traveling on a train from New York to St. Louis with some jewelry . . . . " Jeff looked out of the plane window and thought about Tracy . There was a smile on his face .  | When Tracy returned to New York , her first stop was at Conrad Morgan et Cie Jewelers . Conrad Morgan ushered Tracy into his office and closed the door . He rubbed his hands together and said , " I was getting very worried , my dear . I waited for you in St. Louis and ? " " You were n't in St. Louis . " " What ? What do you mean ? " His blue eyes seemed to twinkle . " I mean , you did n't go to St. Louis . You never intended to meet me . " " But of course I did ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent two men to take them away from me . " There was a puzzled expression on Morgan 's face . " I do n't understand . " " At first I thought there might be a leak in your organization , but there was n't , was there ? It was you . You told me that you personally arranged for my train ticket , so you were the only one who knew the number of my compartment . I used a different name and a disguise , but your men knew exactly where to find me . " There was a look of surprise on his cherubic face . " Are you trying to tell me that some men robbed you of the jewels ? " Tracy smiled . " I 'm trying to tell you that they did n't . " This time the surprise on Morgan 's face was genuine . " You have the jewels ? " " Yes . Your friends were in such a big hurry to catch a plane that they left them behind . " Morgan studied Tracy a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tracy sat down on the couch , perfectly relaxed . Conrad Morgan was gone for almost fifteen minutes , and when he returned , there was a look of dismay on his face . " I 'm afraid a mistake has been made . A big mistake . You 're a very clever young lady , Miss Whitney . You 've earned your twentyfive thousand dollars . " He smiled admiringly . " Give me the jewels and ? " " Fifty thousand . "  | " I beg your pardon ? " " I had to steal them twice . That 's fifty thousand dollars , Mr. Morgan . " " No , " he said flatly . His eyes had lost their twinkle . " I 'm afraid I ca n't give you that much for them . " Tracy rose . " That 's perfectly all right . I 'll try to find someone in Las Vegas who thinks they 're worth that . " She moved toward the door . " Fifty thousand dollars ? " Conrad Morgan asked . Tracy nodded . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn Station . As soon as you give me the money  --  in cash  --  and put me in a taxi , I 'll hand you the key . " Conrad Morgan gave a sigh of defeat . " You 've got a deal . " " Thank you , " Tracy said cheerfully . " It 's been a pleasure doing business with you . "  | Daniel Cooper was already aware of what the meeting in J. J. Reynolds 's office that morning was about , for all the company 's investigators had been sent a memo the day before regarding the Lois Bellamy burglary that had taken place a week earlier . Daniel Cooper loathed conferences . He was too impatient to sit around listening to stupid chatter . He arrived in J. J. Reynolds 's office forty-five minutes late , while Reynolds was in the middle of a speech . " Nice of you to drop by , " J. J. Reynolds said sarcastically . There was no response . It 's a waste of time , Reynolds decided . Cooper did not understand sarcasm  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except how to catch criminals . There , he had to admit , the man was a goddamned genius . Seated in the office were three of the agency 's top investigators : David Swift , Robert Schiffer , and Jerry Davis . " You 've all read the report on the Bellamy burglary , " Reynolds said , " hut something new has been added . It turns out that Lois Bellamy is a cousin of the police commissioner 's . He 's raising holy hell . "  | " What are the police doing ? " Davis asked . " Hiding from the press . Ca n't blame them . The investiiting officers acted like the Keystone Kops . They actually liked to the burglar they caught in the house and let her ? t away . " " Then they should have a good description of her , " Swift iggested . " They have a good description of her nightgown , " Rey ) lds retorted witheringly . " They were so goddamned im-essed with her figure that their brains melted . They do n't Ten know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curler tp , and her face was covered with a mudpack . Their descrip ) n is of a woman somewhere in her middle twenties , with a ntastic ass and tits . There 's not one single clue . We have no formation to go on . Nothing . " Daniel Cooper spoke for the first time . " Yes , we have . " They all turned to look at him , with varying degrees of disce . " What are you talking about ? " Reynolds asked . " I know who she is . " When Cooper had read the memo the morning before , he Id decided to take a look at the Bellamy house , as a logical - st step . To Daniel Cooper , logic was the orderliness of God 's ind , the basic solution to every problem , and to apply logic , ie always started at the beginning . Cooper drove out to the ellamy estate in Long Island , took one look at it , and , withat getting out of his car , turned around and drove back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The house as isolated , and there was no public transportation nearby , hich meant that the burglar could have reached the house ally by car . He was explaining his reasoning to the men assembled in eynolds 's office . " Since she probably would have been rectant to use her own car , which could have been traced , the Ahicle either had to be stolen or rented . I decided to try the ; ntal agencies first . I assumed that she would have rented the IT in Manhattan , where it would be easier for her to cover r trail . "  | Jerry Davis was not impressed . " You 've got to be kidding , Cooper . There must be thousands of cars a day rented in Manhattan . " Cooper ignored the interruption . " All car-rental operations are computerized . Relatively few cars are rented by women . I checked them all out . The lady in question went to Budget Rent a Car at Pier Sixty-one on West Twenty-third Street , rented a Chevy Caprice at eight P.M. the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two A.M. " " How do you know it was the getaway car ? " Reynolds asked skeptically . Cooper was getting bored with the stupid questions . " I checked the elapsed mileage . It 's thirty-two miles to the Lois Bellamy estate and another thirty-two miles back . That checks exactly with the odometer on the Caprice . The car was rented in the name of Ellen Branch . " " A phony , " David Swift surmised . " Right . Her real name is Tracy Whitney . " They were all staring at him . " How the hell do you know that ? " Schiffer demanded . " She gave a false name and address , but she had to sign a rental agreement . I took the original down to One Police Plaza and had them run it through for fingerprints . They matched the prints of Tracy Whitney . She served time at the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women . If you remember , I talked to her about a year ago about a stolen Renoir . " " I remember , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent . " " She was  --  then . She 's not innocent anymore . She pulled the Bellamy job . " The little bastard had done it again ! And he had made it seem so simple . Reynolds tried not to sound grudging . " That 's ? that 's fine work , Cooper . Really fine work . Let 's nail her . We 'll have the police pick her up and ? " " On what charge ? " Cooper asked mildly . " Renting a car ? The police ca n't identify her , and there 's not a shred of evidence against her . " " What are we supposed to do ? " Schiffer asked . " Let her walk away scot-free ? "  | " This time , yes , ' Cooper said . " But I know who she is now . he 'll try something again . And when she does , I 'll catch her . " The meeting was finally over . Cooper desperately wanted a hower . He took out a little black book and wrote in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin my new life , Tracy decided . But what kind of life ? I 've gone from an innocent , naive victim to a . . . what ? A thief  --  that 's what . She thought of Joe Romano and Anthony Orsatti and Perry Pope and Judge Lawrence . No . An avenger . That 's what I 've become . And an adventuress , perhaps . She had outwitted the police , two professional con artists , and a double-crossing jeweler . She thought of Ernestine and Amy and felt a pang . On an impulse , Tracy went to F.A.O . Schwarz and bought a puppet theater , complete with half a dozen characters , and had it mailed to Amy . The card read : SOME NEW FRIENDS FOR YOU . MISS YOU . LOVE TRACY . Next she visited a furrier on Madison Avenue and bought a blue fox boa for Ernestine and mailed it with a money order for two hundred dollars . The card simply read : THANKS , ERNIE . TRACY . All my debts are paid now , Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to go anywhere she liked , do anything she pleased . I She celebrated her independence by checking into a Tower Suite in The Helmsley Palace Hotel . From her forty-seventh-  | floor living room , she could look down at St. Patrick 's Cathedral and see the George Washington Bridge in the distance . Only a few miles in another direction was the dreary place she had recently lived in . Never again , Tracy swore . She opened the bottle of champagne that the management had sent up and sat sipping it , watching the sun set over the skyscrapers of Manhattan . By the time the moon had risen , Tracy had made up her mind . She was going to London . She was ready for all the wonderful things life had to offer . I 've paid my dues , Tracy thought . I deserve some happiness . She lay in bed and turned on the late television news . Two men were being interviewed . Boris Melnikov was a short , stocky Russian , dressed in an ill-fitting brown suit , and Pietr Negulesco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tracy wondered what the two men could possibly have in common . " Where is the chess match going to be held ? " the news anchorman asked . " At Sochi , on the beautiful Black Sea , " Melnikov replied . " You are both international grand masters , and this match has created quite a stir , gentlemen . In your previous matches you have taken the title from each other , and your last one was a draw . Mr. Negulesco , Mr. Melnikov currently holds the title . Do you think you will be able to take it away from him again ? " " Absolutely , " the Romanian replied . " He has no chance , " the Russian retorted . Tracy knew nothing about chess , but there was an arrogance about both men that she found distasteful . She pressed the remote-control button that turned off the television set and went to sleep . Early the following morning Tracy stopped at a travel agency and reserved a suite on the Signal Deck of the Queen Elizabeth II . She was as excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the next three days buying clothes and luggage . On the morning of the sailing Tracy hired a limousine to drive her to the pier . When she arrived at Pier 90 , Berth 3 , at West  | Fifty-fifth and Twelfth Avenue , where the QE II was docked , it was crowded with photographers and television reporters , and for a moment , Tracy was panic-stricken . Then she realized they were interviewing the two men posturing at the foot of the gangplank  --  Melnikov and Negulesco , the international grand masters . Tracy brushed past them , showed her passport to a ship 's officer at the gangplank , and walked up onto the ship . On deck , a steward looked at Tracy 's ticket and directed her to her stateroom . It was a lovely suite , with a private terrace . It had been ridiculously expensive , but Tracy decided it was going to be worth it . She unpacked and then wandered along the corridor . In almost every cabin there were farewell parties going on , with laughter and champagne and conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no one to see her off , no one for her to care about , no one who cared about her . That 's not true , Tracy told herself . Big Bertha wants me . And she laughed aloud . She made her way up to the Boat Deck and had no idea of the admiring glances of the men and the envious stares of the women cast her way . Tracy heard the sound of a deep-throated boat whistle and calls of " All ashore who 's going ashore , " and she was filled with a sudden excitement . She was sailing into a completely unknown future . She felt the huge ship shudder as the tugs started to pull it out of the harbor , and she stood among the passengers on the Boat Deck , watching the Statue of Liberty slide out of sight , and then she went exploring . The QE II was a city , more than nine hundred feet long and thirteen stories high . It had four restaurants , six bars , two ballrooms , two nightclubs , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of shops , four swimming pools , a gymnasium , a golf driving range , a jogging track . I may never want to leave the ship , Tracy marveled . She had reserved a table upstairs in the Princess Grill , which was smaller and more elegant than the main dining room . She barely had been seated when a fitmiliar voice said , " Well , hello there ! "  | She looked up , and there stood Tom Bowers , the bogus FBI man . Oh , no . I do n't deserve this , Tracy thought . " What a pleasant surprise . Do you mind if I join you ? " " Very much . " He slid into the chair across from her and gave her an engaging smile . " We might as well be friends . After all , we 're both here for the same reason , are n't we ? " Tracy had no idea what he was talking about . " Look , Mr. Bowers ? " " Stevens , " he said easily . " Jeff Stevens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait . I 'd like to explain about the last time we met . " " There 's nothing to explain , " Tracy assured him . " An idiot child could have figured it out  --  and did . " " I owed Conrad Morgan a favor . " He grinned ruefully . " I 'm afraid he was n't too happy with me . " There was that same easy , boyish charm that had completely taken her in before . For God 's sake , Dennis , it is n't necessary to put cuffs on her . She 's not going to run away . . . . She said hostilely , " I 'm not too happy with you , either . What are you doing aboard this ship ? Should n't you be on a river-boat ? " He laughed . " With Maximilian Pierpont on board , this is a riverboat . " " Who ? " He looked at her in surprise . " Come on . You mean you really do n't know ? " " Know what ? " " Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hobby is forcing competitive companies out of business . He loves slow horses and fast women , and he owns a lot of both . He 's the last of the big-time spenders . " " And you intend to relieve him of some of his excess wealth . " " Quite a lot of it , as a matter of fact . " He was eyeing her speculatively . " Do you know what you and I should do ? " " I certainly do , Mr. Stevens . We should say good-bye . "  | And he sat there watching as Tracy got up and walked ou of the dining room . She had dinner in her cabin . As she ate , she wondered wha ill fate had placed Jeff Stevens in her path again . She wante to forget the fear she had felt on that train when she though she was under arrest . Well , I 'm not going to let him spoil thi trip . I 'll simply ignore him . After dinner Tracy went up on deck . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a velvet sky . Sh was standing at the rail in the moonlight , watching the sol phosphorescence of the waves and listening to the sounds a the night wind , when he moved up beside her . " You have no idea how beautiful you look standing there Do you believe in shipboard romances ? " " Definitely . What I do n't believe in is you . " She started ti walk away . " Wait . I have some news for you . I just found out that Ma Pierpont is n't on board , after all . He canceled at the las minute . " " Oh , what a shame . You wasted your fare . " " Not necessarily . " He eyed her speculatively . " How woul , you like to pick up a small fortune on this voyage ? " The man is unbelievable . " Unless you have a submarine o a helicopter in your pocket , I do n't think you 'll get away wit robbing anyone on this ship . " " Who said anything about robbing anyone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " What if I have ? " " Melnikov and Negulesco are on their way to Russia for championship match . If I can arrange for you to play the tw of them , " Jeff said earnestly , " we can win a lot of money It 's a perfect setup . " Tracy was looking at him incredulously . " If you can al range for me to play the two of them ? That 's your perfec setup ? " " Uh-huh . Ilow do you like it ? " " I love it . There 's just one t ; ny hitch . " " What 's that ? "  | " I do n't play chess . " He smiled benignly . " No problem . I 'll teach you . " " You 're insane , " Tracy said . " If you want some advice , you 'll find yourself a good psychiatrist . Good night . " The following morning Tracy literally bumped into Boris Melnikov . He was jogging on the Boat Deck , and as Tracy rounded a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . " Watch where you 're going , " he growled . And he kept running . Tracy sat on the deck , looking after him . " Of all the rude ? ! " She stood up and brushed herself off . A steward approached . " Are you hurt , miss ? I saw him ? " " No , I 'm fine , thank you . " Nobody was going to spoil this trip . When Tracy returned to her cabin , there were six messages to call Mr. Jeff Stevens . She ignored them . In the afternoon she swam and read and had a massage , and by the time she went into the bar that evening to have a cocktail before dinner , she was feeling wonderful . Her euphoria was short-lived . Pietr Negulesco , the Romanian , was seated at the bar . When he saw Tracy , he stood up and said , " May I buy you a drink , beautiful lady ? " Tracy hesitated , then smiled . " Why , yes , thank you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonic , please . " Negulesco gave the order to the barman and turned back to Tracy . " I 'm Pietr Negulesco . " " I know . " " Of course . Everyone knows me . I am the greatest chess player in the world . In my country , I am a national hero . " He leaned close to Tracy , put a hand on her knee , and said , " I am also a great fuck . " Tracy thought she had misunderstood him . " What ? " " I am a great fuck . " Her first reaction was to throw her drink in his face , but she controlled herself . She had a better idea . " Excuse me , " she said , " I have to meet a friend . "  | She went to look for Jeff Stevens . She found him in the Princess Grill , but as Tracy started toward his table , she saw that he was dining with a lovely looking blonde with a spectacular figure , dressed in an evening gown that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known better , Tracy thought . She turned and headed down the corridor . A moment later Jeff was at her side . " Tracy . . . did you want to see me ? " " I do n't want to take you away from your . . . dinner . " " She 's dessert , " Jeff said lightly . " What can I do for you ? " " Were you serious about Melnikov and Negulesco ? " " Absolutely . Why ? " " I think they both need a lesson in manners . " " So do I. And we 'll make money while we teach them . " " Good . What 's your plan ? " " You 're going to beat them at chess . " " I 'm serious . " " So am I. " " I told you , I do n't play chess . I do n't know a pawn from a king . I ? " " Do n't worry , " Jeff promised her . " A couple of lessons from me , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , did n't I tell you ? You 're going to play them simultaneously . " Jeff was seated next to Boris Melnikov in the Double Down Piano Bar . " The woman is a fantastic chess player , " Jeff confided to Melnikov . " She 's traveling incognito . " The Russian grunted . " Women know nothing about chess . They can not think . " " This one does . She says she could beat you easily . " Boris Melnikov laughed aloud . " Nobody beats me  --  easily or not . " " She 's willing to bet you ten thousand dollars that she can play you and Pietr Negulesco at the same time and get a draw with at least one of you . "  | Boris Melnikov choked on his drink . " What ! That 's  --  that 's ridiculous ! Play two of us at the same time ? This  --  this female amateur ? " " That 's right . For ten thousand dollars each . " " I should do it just to teach the stupid idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money will be deposited in any country you choose . " A covetous expression flitted across the Russian 's face . " I 've never even heard of this person . And to play the two of us ! My God , she must be insane . " " She has the twenty thousand dollars in cash . " " What nationality is she ? " " American . " " Ah , that explains it . All rich Americans are crazy , especially their women . " Jeff started to rise . " Well , I guess she 'll just have to play Pietr Negulesco alone . " " Negulesco is going to play her ? " " Yes , did n't I tell you ? She wanted to play the two of you , but if you 're afraid . . . " " Afraid ! Boris Melnikov afraid ? " His voice was a roar . " I will destroy her . When is this ridiculous match to take place ? " " She thought perhaps Friday night . The last night out . " Boris Melnikov was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . Only one game . " " For ten thousand dollars ? " " That is correct . " The Russian sighed . " I do not have that much cash with me . " " No problem , " Jeff assured him . " All Miss Whitney really wants is the glory of playing the great Boris Melnikov . If you lose , you give her a personally autographed picture . If you win , you get ten thousand dollars . " " Who holds the stakes ? " There was a sharp note of suspicion in his voice . " The ship 's purser . " " Very well , " Melnikov decided . " Friday night . We will start at ten o'clock , promptly . "  | " She 'll be so pleased , " Jeff assured him . The following morning Jeff was talking to Pietr Negulesco in the gymnasium , where the two men were working out . " She 's an American ? " Pietr Negulesco said . " I should have known . All Americans are cuckoo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negulesco made a gesture of contempt . " Great is not good enough . Best is what counts . And I am the best . " " That 's why she 's so eager to play against you . If you lose , you give her an autographed picture . If you win , you get ten thousand dollars in cash . . . " " Negulesco does not play amateurs. " . . deposited in any country you like . " " Out of the question . " " Well , then , I guess she 'll have to play only Boris Melnikov . " " What ? Are you saying Melnikov has agreed to play against this woman ? " " Of course . But she was hoping to play you both at once . " " I 've never heard of anything so  --  so ? " Negulesco sputtered , at a loss for words . " The arrogance ! Who is she that she thinks she can defeat the two top chess masters in the world ? She must have escaped from some lunatic asylum . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but her money is good . All cash . " " You said ten thousand dollars for defeating her ? " " That 's right . " " And Boris Melnikov gets the same amount ? " " If he defeats her . " Pietr Negulesco grinned . " Oh , he will defeat her . And so will I. " " Just between us , I would n't be a bit surprised . " " Who will hold the stakes ? " " The ship 's purser . " Why should Melnikov he the only one to take money from this woman ? thought Pietr Negulesco . " My friend , you have a deal . Where and when ? " " Friday night . Ten o'clock . The Queen 's Room . " heir Negulesco smiled wolfishly . " I will be there . "  | " You mean they agreed ? " Tracy cried . " That 's right . " " I 'm going to be sick . " " I 'll get you a cold towel . " Jeff hurried into the bathroom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and brought it back to her . She was lying on the chaise longue . He placed the towel on her forehead . " How does that feel ? " " Terrible . I think I have a migraine . " " Have you ever had a migraine before ? " " No . " " Then you do n't have one now . Listen to me , Tracy , it 's perfectly natural to be nervous before something like this . " She leapt up and flung down the towel . " Something like this ? There 's never been anything like this ! I 'm playing two international master chess players with one chess lesson from you and ? " " Two , " Jeff corrected her . " You have a natural talent for chess . " " My God , why did I ever let you talk me into this ? " " Because we 're going to make a lot of money . " " I do n't want to make a lot of money , " Tracy wailed . " I want this boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Now , just stay calm , " Jeff said soothingly . " It 's going to be ? " " It 's going to be a disaster ! Everyone on this ship is going to be watching . " " That 's exactly the point , is n't it ? " Jeff beamed . Jeff had made all the arrangements with the ship 's purser . He had given the purser the stakes to hold-$20,000 in traveler 's checks  --  and asked him to set up two chess tables for Friday evening . The word spread rapidly throughout the ship , and passengers kept approaching Jeff to ask if the matches were actually going to take place . " Absolutely , " Jeff assured all who inquired . " It 's incredible . Poor Miss Whitney believes she can win . In fact , she 's hettina on it . "  | " I wonder , " a passenger asked , " If I might place a small bet ? " " Certainly . As much money as you like . Miss Whitney is asking only ten-to-one odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the moment the first bet was accepted , the floodgates opened . It seemed that everyone on board , including the engine-room crew and the ship 's officers , wanted to place bets on the game . The amounts varied from five dollars to five thousand dollars and every single bet was on the Russian and the Romanian . The suspicious purser reported to the captain . " I 've never seen anything like it , sir . It 's a stampede . Nearly all the passengers have placed wagers . I must be holding two hundred thousand dollars in bets . " The captain studied him thoughtfully . " You say Miss Whitney is going to play Melnikov and Negulesco at the same time ? " " Yes , Captain . " " Have you verified that the two men are really Pietr Negulesco and Boris Melnikov ? " " Oh , yes , of course , sir . " " There 's no chance they would deliberately throw the chess game , is there ? " " Not with their egos . I think they 'd rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's probably exactly what would happen to them when they got home . " The captain ran his fingers through his hair , a puzzled frown on his face . " Do you know anything about Miss Whitney or this Mr. Stevens ? " " Not a thing , sir . As far as I can determine , they 're traveling separately . " The captain made his decision . " It smells like some kind of con game , and ordinarily I would put a stop to it . However , I happen to be a bit of an expert myself , and if there was one thing I 'd stake my life on , it 's the fact that there is no way to cheat at chess . Let the match go on . " He walked over to his desk and withdrew a black : eather wallet . " Put down fifty pounds for me . On the masters . " * * *  | By 9:00 Friday evening the Queen 's Room was packed with passengers from first class , those who had sneaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and members of the crew who were off duty . At Jeff Stevens 's request , two rooms had been set up for the tournament . One table was in the center of the Queen 's Room , and the other table was in the adjoining salon . Curtains had been drawn to separate the two rooms . " So that the players are n't distracted by each other , " Jeff explained . " And we would like the spectators to remain in whichever room they choose . " Velvet ropes had been placed around the two tables to keep the crowds back . The spectators were about to witness something they were sure they would never see again . They knew nothing about the beautiful young American woman , except that it would be impossible for her  --  or anyone else  --  to play the great Negulesco and Melnikov simultaneously and obtain a draw with either of them . Jeff introduced Tracy to the two grand masters shortly before the game was to begin . Tracy looked like a Grecian painting in a muted green chiffon Galanos gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her pale face . Pietr Negulesco looked her over carefully . " Have you won all the national tournaments you have played in ? " he asked . " Yes , " Tracy replied truthfully . He shrugged . " I have never heard of you . " Boris Melnikov was equally rude . " You Americans do not know what to do with your money , " he said . " I wish to thank you in advance . My winnings will make my family very happy . " Tracy 's eyes were green jade . " You have n't won , yet , Mr. Melnikov . " Melnikov 's laugh boomed out through the room . " My dear lady , I do n't know who you are , but I know who I am . I am the great Boris Melnikov . " It was 10:00 . Jeff looked around and saw that both salons had filled up with spectators . " It 's time for the match to start . " Tracy sat down across the table from Melnikov and won-  | dered for the hundredth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing to it , " Jeff had assured her . " Trust me . " And like a fool she had trusted him . I must have been out of my mind , Tracy thought . She was playing the two greatest chess players in the world , and she knew nothing about the game , except what Jeff had spent four hours teaching her . The big moment had arrived . Tracy felt her legs trembling . Melnikov turned to the expectant crowd and grinned . He made a hissing noise at a steward . " Bring me a brandy . Napoleon . " " In order to be fair to everyone , " Jeff had said to Melnikov , " I suggest that you play the white so that you go first , and in the game with Mr. Negulesco , Miss Whitney will play the white and she will go first . " Both grand masters agreed . While the audience stood hushed , Boris Melnikov reached across the board and played the queen 's gambit decline opening , moving his queen pawn two squares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to crush her . He glanced up at Tracy . She studied the board , nodded , and stood up , without moving a piece . A steward cleared the way through the crowd as Tracy walked into the second salon , where Pietr Negulesco was seated at a table waiting for her . There were at least a hundred people crowding the room as Tracy took her seat opposite Negulesco . " Ah , my little pigeon . Have you defeated Boris yet ? " Pietr Negulesco laughed uproariously at his joke . " I 'm working on it , Mr. Negulesco , " Tracy said quietly . She reached forward and moved her white queen 's pawn two squares . Negulesco looked up at her and grinned . He had arranged for a massage in one hour , but he planned to finish this game before then . He reached down and moved his black queen 's pawn two squares . Tracy studied the board a moment , then rose . The steward escorted her back to Boris Melnikov . Tracy sat down at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the background she saw Jeff 's almost imperceptible nod of ' approval .  | Without hesitation , Boris Melnikov moved his white queen 's bishop pawn two squares . Two minutes later , at Negulesco 's table , Tracy moved her white queen 's bishop two squares . Negulesco played his king 's pawn square . Tracy rose and returned to the room where Boris Melnikov was waiting . Tracy played her king 's pawn square . So ! She is not a complete amateur , Melnikov thought in surprise . Let us see what she does with this . He played his queen 's knight to queen 's bishop 3 . Tracy watched his move , nodded , and returned to Negulesco , where she copied Melnikov 's move . Negulesco moved the queen 's bishop pawn two squares , and Tracy went back to Melnikov and repeated Negulesco 's move . With growing astonishment , the two grand masters realized they were up against a brilliant opponent . No matter how clever their moves , this amateur managed to counteract them . Because they were separated , Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , they were playing against each other . Every move that Melnikov made with Tracy , Tracy repeated with Negulesco . And when Negulesco countered with a move , Tracy used that move against Melnikov . By the time the grand masters entered the middle game , they were no longer smug . They were fighting for their reputations . They paced the floor while they contemplated moves and puffed furiously on cigarettes . Tracy appeared to be the only calm one . In the beginning , in order to end the game quickly , Melnikov had tried a knight 's sacrifice to allow his white bishop to put pressure on the black king 's side . Tracy had carried the move to Negulesco . Negulesco had examined the move carefully , then refuted the sacrifice by covering his exposed side , and when Negulesco had sacked a bishop to advance a rook to white 's seventh rank , Melnikov had refuted it before the black rook could damage his pawn structure . There was no stopping Tracy . The game had been going on for four hours , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every grand master carries in his head hundreds of games played by other grand masters . It was as this particular match was going into the end game that both Melnikov and Negulesco recognized the hallmark of the other . The bitch , Melnikov thought . She has studied with Negulesco . He has tutored her . And Negulesco thought , She is Melnikov 's protege . The bastard has taught her his game . The harder they fought Tracy , the more they came to realize there was simply no way they could beat her . The match was appearing drawish . In the sixth hour of play , at 4:00 A.M. , when the players had reached the end game , the pieces on each board had been reduced to three pawns , one rook , and a king . There was no way for either side to win . Melnikov studied the board for a long time , then took a deep , choked breath and said , " I offer a draw . " Over the hubbub , Tracy said , " I accept . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd into the next room . As she started to take her seat , Negulesco , in a strangled voice said , " I offer a draw . " And the uproar from the other room was repeated . The crowd could not believe what it had just witnessed . A woman had come out of nowhere to simultaneously stalemate the two greatest chess masters in the world . Jeff appeared at Tracy 's side . " Come on , " he grinned . " We both need a drink . " When they left , Boris Melnikov and Pietr Negulesco were still slumped in their chairs , mindlessly staring at their boards . Tracy and Jeff sat at a table for two in the Upper Deck bar . " You were beautiful , " Jeff laughed . " Did you notice the look on Melnikov 's face ? I thought he was going to have a heart ; attack . " " 1 thought I was going to have a heart attack , " Tracy said . " 11ow much did we win ? " " About two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purser in the morning when we dock at Southampton . I 'll meet you for breakfast in the dining room . " " Fine . " " I think I 'll turn in now . Let me walk you to your stateroom . " " I 'm not ready to go to bed yet , Jeff . I 'm too excited . You go ahead . " " You were a champion , " Jeff told her . He leaned over and kissed her lightly on the cheek . " Good night , Tracy . " " Good night , Jeff . " She watched him leave . Go to sleep ? Impossible ! It had been one of the most fantastic nights of her life . The Russian and the Romanian had been so sure of themselves , so arrogant . Jeff had said , " Trust me , " and she had . She had no illusions about what he was . He was a con artist . He was bright and amusing and clever , easy to be with . But of course she could never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his stateroom when he encountered one of the ship 's officers . " Good show , Mr. Stevens . The word about the match has already gone out over the wireless . I imagine the press will be meeting you both at Southampton . Are you Miss Whitney 's manager ? " " No , we 're just shipboard acquaintances , " Jeff said easily , but his mind was racing . If he and Tracy were linked together , it would look like a setup . There could even be an investigation . He decided to collect the money before any suspicions were aroused . Jeff wrote a note to Tracy . HAVE PICKED UP MONEY AND WILL MEET YOU FOR A CELEBRATION BREAKFAST AT THE SAVOY HOTEL . YOU WERE MAGNIFICENT . JEFF . He sealed it in an envelope and handed it to a steward . " Please see that Miss Whitney gets this first thing in the morning . " " Yes , sir . " Jeff headed for the purser 's office . " Sorry to bother you , " Jeff apologized , " hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know how busy you 're going to be , so 1 wondered whether you 'd mind paying me off now ? "  | " No trouble at all , " the purser smiled . " Your young lady is really wizard , is n't she ? " " She certainly is . " " If you do n't mind my asking , Mr. Stevens , where in the world did she learn to play chess like that ? " Jeff leaned close and confided , " I heard she studied with Bobby Fischer . " The purser took two large manila envelopes out of the safe . " This is a lot of cash to carry around . Would you like me to give you a check for this amount ? " " No , do n't bother . The cash will be fine , " Jeff assured him . " I wonder if you could do me a favor ? The mail boat comes out to meet the ship before it docks , does n't it ? " " Yes , sir . We 're expecting it at six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange for me to leave on the mail boat . My mother is seriously ill , and I 'd like to get to her before it 's " ? his voice dropped ? " before it 's too late . " " Oh , I 'm dreadfully sorry , Mr. Stevens . Of course I can handle that for you . I 'll make the arrangements with customs . " At 6:15 A.M. Jeff Stevens , with the two envelopes carefully stashed away in his suitcase , climbed down the ship 's ladder into the mail boat . He turned to take one last look at the outline of the huge ship towering above him . The passengers on the liner were sound asleep . Jeff would be on the dock long before the QE II landed . " It was a beautiful voyage , " Jeff said to one of the crewmen on the mail boat . " Yes , it was , was n't it ? " a voice agreed . Jeff turned around . Tracy was seated on a coil of rope , her hair blowing softly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " What do you think I 'm doing ? " l le saw the expression on her face . " Wait a minute ! You did n't think I was going to run out on you ? " " Why would I think that ? " i , ier tone was bitter . " " Tracy , I left a note for you . I was going to meet you at the Savoy and ? "  | " Of course you were , " she said cuttingly . " You never give up , do you ? " He looked at her , and there was nothing more for him to say . In Tracy 's suite at the Savoy , she watched carefully as Jeff counted out the money . " Your share comes to one hundred and one thousand dollars . " " Thank you . " Her tone was icy . Jeff said , " You know , you 're wrong about me , Tracy . I wish you 'd give me a chance to explain . Will you have dinner with me tonight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good . I 'll pick you up at eight o'clock . " When Jeff Stevens arrived at the hotel that evening and asked for Tracy , the room clerk said , " I 'm sorry , sir . Miss Whitney checked out early this afternoon . She left no forwarding address . "  | It was the handwritten invitation , Tracy decided later , that changed her life . After , collecting her share of the money from Jeff Stevens , Tracy checked out of the Savoy and moved into 47 Park Street , a quiet , semiresidential hotel with large , pleasant rooms and superb service . On her second day in London the invitation was delivered to her suite by the hall porter . It was written in a fine , copperplate handwriting : " A mutual friend has suggested that it might be advantageous for us to become acquainted . Wo n't you join me for tea at the Ritz this afternoon at 4:00 ? If you will forgive the cliche , I will be wearing a red carnation . " It was signed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her first inclination was to ignore the note , but her curiosity got the better of her , and at 4:15 she was at the entrance of the elegant dining hall of the Ritz Hotel . She noticed him immediately . He was in his sixties , Tracy guessed , an interesting-looking man with a lean , intellectual lace . His skin was smooth and clear , almost trans-  | lucent . He was dressed in an expensively tailored gray suit and wore a red carnation in his lapel . As Tracy walked toward his table , he rose and bowed slightly . " Thank you for accepting my invitation . " He seated her with an old-fashioned gallantry that Tracy found attractive . He seemed to belong to another world . Tracy could not imagine what on earth he wanted with her . " I came because I was curious , " Tracy confessed , " but are you sure you have n't confused me with some other Tracy Whitney ? " Gunther Hartog smiled . " From what I have heard , there is only one Tracy Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shall we discuss that over tea ? " Tea consisted of finger sandwiches , filled with chopped egg , salmon , cucumber , watercress , and chicken . There were hot scones with clotted cream and jam , and freshly made pastries , accompanied by Twinings tea . As they ate , they talked . " Your note mentioned a mutual friend , " Tracy began . " Conrad Morgan . I do business with him from time to time . " I did business with him once , Tracy thought grimly . And he tried to cheat me . " He 's a great admirer of yours , " Gunther Hartog was saying . Tracy looked at her host more closely . He had the bearing of an aristocrat and the look of wealth . What does he want with me ? Tracy wondered again . She decided to let him pursue the subject , but there was no further mention of Conrad Morgan or of what possible mutual benefit there could be between Gunther Hartog and Tracy Whitney . Tracy found the meeting enjoyable and intriguing . Gunther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Munich . My father was a banker . He was wealthy , and I 'm afraid I grew up rather spoiled , surrounded by beautiful paintings and antiques . My mother was Jewish , and when Hitler came to power , my father refused to desert my mother , and so he was stripped of everything . They were both killed in the bombings . Friends smuggled me out of Germany to Switzerland , and when the war was over , I decided not to return to Germany . I moved  | to London and opened a small antique shop on Mount Street . I hope that you will visit it one day . " That 's what this is all about , Tracy thought in surprise . He wants to sell me something . As it turned out , she was wrong . As Gunther Hartog was paying the check , he said , casually , " I have a little country house in Hampshire . I 'm having a few friends down for the weekend , and I 'd be delighted if you would join us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she still had no idea what he wanted from her . She decided she had nothing to lose . The weekend turned out to be fascinating . Gunther Hartog 's " little country house " was a beautiful seventeenth-century manor home on a thirty-acre estate . Gunther was a widower , and except for his servants , he lived alone . He took Tracy on a tour of the grounds . There was a barn stabling half a dozen horses , and a yard where he raised chickens and pigs . " That 's so we 'll never go hungry , " he said gravely . " Now , let me show you my real hobby . " He led Tracy to a cote full of pigeons . " These are homing pigeons . " Gunther 's voice was filled with pride . " Look at these little beauties . See that slate-gray one over there ? That 's Margo . " He picked her up and held her . " You really are a dreadful girl , do you know that ? She bullies the others , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the small head and carefully set her down . The colors of the birds were spectacular : There was a variety of blue-black , blue-gray with checked patterns , and silver . " Rut no white ones , " Tracy noticed . " Homing pigeons are never white , " Gunther explained , " because white feathers come off too easily , and when pigeons are homing , they fly at an average of forty miles an hour . " Tracy watched Gunther as he fed the birds a special racing feed with added vitamins . " ' they are an amazing species , " Gunther said . " Do you  | know they can find their way home from over five hundred miles away ? " " That 's fascinating . " The guests were equally fascinating . There was a cabinet minister , with his wife ; an earl ; a general and his girl friend ; and the Maharani of Morvi , a very attractive , friendly young woman . " Please call me V.J. , " she said , in an almost unaccented voice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most beautiful jewels Tracy had ever seen . " I keep most of my jewelry in a vault , " V.J. explained . " There are so many robberies these days . " On Sunday afternoon , shortly before Tracy was to return to London , Gunther invited her into his study . They sat across from each other over a tea tray . As Tracy poured the tea into the wafer-thin Belleek cups , she said , " I do n't know why you invited me here , Gunther , but whatever the reason , I 've had a wonderful time . " " I 'm pleased , Tracy . " Then , after a moment , he continued . " I 've been observing you . " " I see . " " Do you have any plans for the future ? " She hesitated . " No . I have n't decided what I 'm going to do yet . " " I think we could work well together . " " You mean in your antique shop ? " He laughed . " No , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents . You see , I know about your escapade with Conrad Morgan . You handled it brilliantly . " " Gunther . . . all that 's behind me . " " But what 's ahead of you ? You said you have no plans . You must think about your future . Whatever money you have is surely going to run out one day . I 'm suggesting a partnership . I travel in very affluent , international circles . I attend charity balls and hunting parties and yachting parties . I know the comings and goings of the rich . " " I do n't see what that has to do with me ? " " I can introduce you into that golden circle . And I do mean golden , Tracy . I can supply you with information about fab-  | ulous jewels and paintings , and how you can safely acquire them . I can dispose of them privately . You would be balancing the ledgers of people who have become wealthy at the expense of others . Everything would be divided evenly between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He studied her thoughtfully . " I see . You will call me if you change your mind ? " " I wo n't change my mind , Gunther . " Late that afternoon Tracy returned to London . Tracy adored London . She dined at Le Gavroche and Bill Bentley 's and Coin du Feu , and went to Drones after the theater , for real American hamburgers and hot chili . She went to the National Theatre and the Royal Opera House and attended auctions at Christie 's and Sotheby 's . She shopped at Harrods , and Fortnum and Mason 's , and browsed for books at Hatchards and Foyles , and H. W. Smith . She hired a car and driver and spent a memorable weekend at the Chewton Glen Hotel in Hampshire , on the fringe of the New Forest , where the setting was spectacular and the service impeccable . But all these things were expensive . Whatever money you have is sure to run out some day . Gunther Hartog was right . Her money was not going to last forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . She was invited back for more weekends at Gunther 's country home , and she thoroughly enjoyed each visit and delighted in Gunther 's company . One Sunday evening at dinner a member of Parliament turned to Tracy and said , " I 've never met a real Texan , Miss Whitney . What are they like ? " Tracy went into a wicked imitation of a noveau riche Texas dowager and had the company roaring with laughter . Later , when Tracy and Gunther were alone , he asked , " How would you like to make a small fortune doing that imitation ? " " I 'm not an actress , Gunther . " " You underestimate yourself . There 's a jewelry firm in London  --  Parker and Parker  --  that takes a delight in  --  as you  | Americans would say  --  ripping off their customers . You 've given me an idea how to make them pay for their dishonesty . " He told Tracy his idea . " No , " Tracy said . But the more she thought about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outwitting the police in Long Island , and Boris Melnikov and Pietr Negulesco , and Jeff Stevens . It had been a thrill that was indescribable . Still , that was part of the past . " No , Gunther , " she said again . But this time there was less certainty in her voice . London was unseasonably warm for October , and Englishmen and tourists alike took advantage of the bright sunshine . The noon traffic was heavy with tie-ups at Trafalgar Square , Charing Cross , and Piccadilly Circus . A white Daimler turned off Oxford Street to New Bond Street and threaded its way through the traffic , passing Roland Cartier , Geigers , and the Royal Bank of Scotland . A few doors farther on , it coasted to a stop in front of a jewelry store . A discreet , polished sign at the side of the door read : PARKER &; PARKER . A liveried chauffeur stepped out of the limousine and hurried around to open the rear door for his passenger . A young woman with blond Sassoon-ed hair , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a sable coat , totally inappropriate for the weather , jumped out of the car . " Which way 's the joint , junior ? " she asked . Her voice was loud , with a grating Texas accent . The chauffeur indicated the entrance . " There , madame . " " Okay , honey . Stick around . This ai n't gon na take long . " " I may have to circle the block , madame . I wo n't be permitted to park here . " She clapped him on the back and said , " You do what you got ta do , sport . " Sport ! The chauffeur winced . It was his punishment for being reduced to chauffeuring rental cars . He disliked all Americans , particularly Texans . They were savages ; but savages with money . He would have been astonished to learn that his passenger had never even seen the Lone Star State . Tracy checked her reflection in the display window , smiled  | broadly , and strutted toward the door , which was opened by a uniformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afternoon , sport . You sell anythin ' besides costume jewelry in this joint ? " She chuckled at her joke . The doorman blanched . Tracy swept into the store , trailing an overpowering scent of Chloe behind her . Arthur Chilton , a salesman in a morning coat , moved toward her . " May I help you , madame ? " " Maybe , maybe not . Old P.J. told me to buy myself a little birthday present , so here I am . Whatcha got ? " " Is there something in particular Madame is interested in ? " " Hey , pardner , you English fellows are fast workers , ain'cha ? " She laughed raucously and clapped him on the shoulder . He forced himself to remain impassive . " Mebbe somethin ' in emeralds . Old P.J. loves to buy me emeralds . " " If you 'll step this way , please . . . . " Chilton led her to a vitrine where several trays of emeralds were displayed . The bleached blonde gave them one disdainful glance . " These 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chilton said stiffly , " These range in price up to thirty thousand dollars . " " Hell , I tip my hairdresser that . " The woman guffawed . " Old P.J. would be insulted if I came back with one of them little pebbles . " Chilton visualized old P.J. Fat and paunchy and as loud and obnoxious as this woman . They deserved each other . Why did money always flow to the undeserving ? he wondered . " What price range was Madame interested in ? " " Why do n't we start with somethin ' around a hundred G 's . " Ile looked blank . " A hundred G 's ? " " I tell , I thought you people was supposed to speak the king 's : english . A hundred grand . A hundred thou . " Ile swallowed . " Oh . In that case , perhaps it would be better if you spoke with our managing director . " The managing director , Gregory Elalston , insisted on personally handling all large sales , and since the employees of Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | ence to them . With a customer as distasteful as this one , Chilton was relieved to let Halston deal with her . Chilton pressed a button under the counter , and a moment later a pale , reedylooking man bustled out of a back room . He took a look at the outrageously dressed blonde and prayed that none of his regular customers appeared until the woman had departed . Chilton said , " Mr. Halston , this is Mrs. . . . er . . . ? " He turned to the woman . " Benecke , honey . Mary Lou Benecke . Old P.J. Benecke 's wife . Betcha you all have heard of P.J. Benecke . " " Of course . " Gregory Halston gave her a smile that barely touched his lips . " Mrs. Benecke is interested in purchasing an emerald , Mr. Halston . " Gregory Halston indicated the trays of emeralds . " We have some fine emeralds here that ? " " She wanted something for approximately a hundred thousand dollars . " This time the smile that lit Gregory Halston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the day . " You see , it 's my birthday , and old P.J. wants me to buy myself somethin ' pretty . " " Indeed , " Halston said . " Would you follow me , please ? " " You little rascal , what you got in mind ? " The blonde giggled . Halston and Chilton exchanged a pained look . Bloody Americans ! Halston led the woman to a locked door and opened it with a key . They entered a small , brightly lit room , and Halston carefully locked the door behind them . " This is where we keep our merchandise for our valued customers , " he said . In the center of the room was a showcase filled with a stunning array of diamonds , rubies , and emeralds , flashing their bright colors . " Well , this is more like it . Old P.J. 'd go crazy in here . " " Does Madame see something she likes ? " " Well , let 's jest see what we got here . " She walked over to  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that there bunch . " Halston extracted another small key from his pocket , unlocked the case , lifted out a tray of emeralds , and placed it on top of the table . There were ten emeralds in the velvet case . Halston watched as the woman picked up the largest of them , an exquisite pin in a platinum setting . " As old P.J. would say , This here one 's got my name writ on it . ' " " Madame has excellent taste . This is a ten-carat grass-green Colombian . It 's flawless and ? " " Emeralds ai n't never flawless . " Halston was taken aback for an instant . " Madame is correct , of course . What I meant was ? " For the first time he noticed that the woman 's eyes were as green as the stone she twisted in her hands , turning it around , studying its facets . " We have a wider selection if ? " " No sweat , sweetie . I 'll take this here one . " The sale had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Then he added delicately , " In dollars it comes to one hundred thousand . How will Madame be paying ? " " Do n't you worry , Ralston , old sport , I have a dollar account at a bank here in London . I 'll write out a little ole personal check . Then P.J. can jest pay me back . " " Excellent . I 'll have the stone cleaned for you and delivered to your hotel . " The stone did not need cleaning , but Halston had no intention of letting it out of his possession until her check had cleared , for too many jewelers he knew had been bilked by clever swindlers . Halston prided himself on the fact that he had never been cheated out of one pound . " Where shall I have the emerald delivered ? " " We got ourselves the Oliver Messel Suite at the Dorch . " I lalston made a note . " The Dorchester . " " I call it the Oliver Messy Suite , " she laughed . " Lots of people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A-rabs , but old P.J. does a lot of business with them . Oil is its own  | country , ' he always says . P.J. Benecke 's one smart fella . " " I 'm sure he is , " Halston replied dutifully . He watched as she tore out a check and began writing . He noted that it was a Barclays Bank check . Good . He had a friend there who would verify the Beneckes ' account . He picked up the check . " I 'll have the emerald delivered to you personally tomorrow morning . " " Old P.J. 's gon na love it , " she beamed . " I am sure he will , " Halston said politely . He walked her to the front door . " Ralston ? " He almost corrected her , then decided against it . Why bother ? He was never going to lay eyes on her again , thank God ! " Yes , madame ? " " You got ta come up and have tea with us some afternoon . You 'll love old P.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work afternoons . " " Too bad . " He watched as his customer walked out to the curb . A white Daimler slithered up , and a chauffeur got out and opened the door for her . The blonde turned to give Halston the thumbsup sign as she drove off . When Halston returned to his office , he immediately picked up the telephone and called his friend at Barclays . " Peter , dear , I have a check here for a hundred thousand dollars drawn on the account of a Mrs. Mary Lou Benecke . Is it good ? " " Hold on , old boy . " Halston waited . He hoped the check was good , for business had been slow lately . The miserable Parker brothers , who owned the store , were constantly complaining , as though it were he who was responsible and not the recession . Of course , profits were not down as much as they could have been , for Parker &; Parker had a department that specialized in cleaning jewelry , and at frequent intervals the jewelry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been brought in . Complaints had been lodged , but nothing had ever been proven . Peter was back on the line . " No problem , Gregory . There 's more than enough money in the account to cover the check . "  | Halston felt a little frisson of relief . " Thank you , Peter . " " Not at all . " " Lunch next week  --  on me . " The check cleared the following morning , and the Colombian emerald was delivered by bonded messenger to Mrs. P.J. Benecke at the Dorchester Hotel . That afternoon , shortly before closing time , Gregory Halston 's secretary said , " A Mrs. Benecke is here to see you , Mr. Halston . " His heart sank . She had come to return the pin , and he could hardly refuse to take it back . Damn all women , all Americans , and all Texans ! Halston put on a smile and went out to greet her . " Good afternoon , Mrs. Benecke . I assume your husband did n't like the pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buster . Old P.J. was just plain crazy about it . " Halston 's heart began to sing . " He was ? " " In fact , he liked it so much he wants me to get another one so we can have ' em made into a pair of earrings . Let me have a twin to the one I got . " A small frown appeared on Gregory Halston 's face . " I 'm afraid we might have a little problem there , Mrs. Benecke . " " What kinda problem , honey ? " " Yours is a unique stone . There 's not another one like it . Now , I have a lovely set in a different style I could ? " " I do n't want a different style . I want one jest like the one I bought . " " To be perfectly candid , Mrs. Benecke , there are n't very many ten-carat Colombian flawless " ? he saw her look ? " nearly flawless stones available . " " Come on , sport . There 's got ta be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen very few stones of that quality , and to try to duplicate it exactly in shape and color would be almost impossible . " " We got a sayin ' in Texas that the impossible jest takes a little longer . Saturday 's my birthday . P.J. wants me to have those earrings , and what P.J. wants , P.J. gets . "  | " I really do n't think I can ? " " How much did I pay for that pin  --  a hundred grand ? I know old P.J. will go up to two hundred or three hundred thousand for another one . " Gregory Halston was thinking fast . There had to be a duplicate of that stone somewhere , and if P. J. Benecke was willing to pay an extra $200,000 for it , that would mean a tidy profit . In fact , Halston thought , I can work it out so that it means a tidy profit for me . Aloud he said , " I 'll inquire around , Mrs. Benecke . I 'm sure that no other jeweler in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up for auction . I 'll do some advertising and see what results I get . " " You got till the end of the week , " the blonde told him . " And jest between you and me and the lamppost , old P.J. will probably be willin ' to go up to three hundred fifty thousand for it . " And Mrs. Benecke was gone , her sable coat billowing out behind her . Gregory Halston sat in his office lost in a daydream . Fate had placed in his hands a man who was so besotted with his blond tart that he was willing to pay $350,000 for a $100,000 emerald . That was a net profit of $250,000 . Gregory Halston saw no need to burden the Parker brothers with the details of the transaction . It would be a simple matter to record the sale of the second emerald at $100,000 and pocket the rest . The extra $250,000 would set him up for life . All he had to do now was to find a twin to the emerald he had sold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult than Halston had anticipated . None of the jewelers he telephoned had anything in stock that resembled what he required . He placed advertisements in the London Times and the Financial Times , and he called Christie 's and Sotheby 's , and a dozen estate agents . In the next few days Halston was inundated with a flood of inferior emeralds , good emeralds , and a few first-quality emeralds , but none of them came close to what he was looking for . On Wednesday Mrs. Benecke telephoned . " Old P.J. 's get-  | tin ' mighty restless , " she warned . " Did you find it yet ? " " Not yet , Mrs. Benecke , " Halston assured her , " but do n't worry , we will . " On Friday she telephoned again . " Tomorrow 's my birthday , " she reminded Halston . " I know , Mrs. Benecke . If I only had a few more days , I know I could ? " " Well , never mind , sport . If you do n't have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one I bought from you . Old P.J. ? bless his heart  --  says he 's gon na buy me a big ole country estate instead . Ever hear of a place called Sussex ? " Halston broke out in perspiration . " Mrs. Benecke , " he moaned earnestly , " you would hate living in Sussex . You would loathe living in a country house . Most of them are in deplorable condition . They have no central heating and ? " " Between you and I , " she interrupted , " I 'd rather have them earrings . Old P.J. even mentioned somethin ' about bein ' willin ' to pay four hundred thousand dollars for a twin to that stone . You got no idea how stubborn old P.J. can be . " Four hundred thousand ! Halston could feel the money slipping between his fingers . " Believe me , I 'm doing everything I can , " he pleaded . " I need a little more time . " " It ai n't up to me , honey , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . Halston sat there cursing fate . Where could he find an identical ten-carat emerald ? He was so busy with his bitter thoughts that he did not hear his intercom until the third buzz . He pushed down the button and snapped , " What is it ? " " There 's a Contessa Marissa on the telephone , Mr. Halston . She 's calling about our advertisement for the emerald . " Another one ! He had had at least ten calls that morning , every one of them a waste of time . He picked up the telephone and said ungraciously , " Yes ? " A soft female voice with an Italian accent said , " Buon giorno , signore . I have read you are interested possibly in buying an emerald , sI ? " " If it fits my qualifications , yes . " He could not keep the impatience out of his voice . " I have an emerald that has been in my family for many                 @ @ @ @
