WASHINGTON  --  A hostile House Banking Committee got its first detailed look at some specific terms of sales of insolvent thrifts , in which tax breaks for buyers of the institutions totaled $4 billion in December and $8 billion for all 205 transactions in 1988 . The tax breaks for wealthy investors who acquired the thrifts with federal assistance have become a lightning rod for congressional criticism of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board . For months , the Bank Board has been selling insolvent institutions as a means of protecting the thrifts ' federally insured depositors , while stating that no taxpayer money was being used . Congress specifically permitted the tax incentives for buyers of the thrifts in legislation passed in 1987 . In testimony before the banking committee yesterday , Bank Board members said the agency last month provided $16. 6 billion in federal assistance  --  much of it in notes  --  to bring the net worth of 75 insolvent institutions out of the red and attract investors to the deals . For their part , investors brought about $3 billion in new capital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged the terms of the transactions , and the bidding process that gave rise to deals in which tax breaks from the government exceeded capital investment by acquirers . Rep. Jim Leach ( R. , Iowa ) called the acquirers of the institutions " jackals picking over the bones of dead institutions , " adding , " the Bank Board is itself bankrupt . It ought to go into immediate receivership of the U.S. Treasury . " Danny Wall , chairman of the Bank Board , reminded Congress of the origin of the tax breaks for thrift acquirers and defended their use . " The Congress enacted them , " he said . " The president signed them . " But following months in which the Bank Board disclosed only the barest terms of most of the transactions , the committee was incredulous at the scale of the tax incentives . Of the $4 billion provided in a year-end wave of deals to beat a Dec. 31 deadline for the tax break , about half went to the acquirers . In many cases , the tax breaks won ' t stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield income of a parent company . Ford Motor Co. , for example , will be able to take advantage of more than $200 million in tax benefits , regardless of how the thrift performs , so long as it owns the thrift . " I don ' t have a problem with tax breaks that stay in the institution that act as an incentive for new management , " said Rep. Charles Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) . " But why did you get so little for them ? " he asked the Bank Board members . The remaining $2 billion in tax incentives went back to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. , an arm of the Bank Board , in the form of reduced assistance to acquirers . " It ' s a way to make our resources go further , " said Bank Board member Larry White . " We can substitute the Treasury for our money . " Although committee members questioned the merits of the transactions , the Bank Board said it had little financial room to maneuver . The Bank Board is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their liabilities from growing , but it hasn ' t the cash to liquidate the thrifts and pay off the depositors . Including the tax breaks , the Bank Board committed $20. 6 billion in federal assistance in the December deals alone , which was still below the cost of liquidation . The Bank Board said that to liquidate those institutions in the December deals would have required $22. 7 billion  --  including $47 billion in cash up front , before it recouped some of the money through the sale of assets . The Bank Board renewed its plea for Congress to explicitly back the notes issued to acquirers in the thrift sales , contending such a declaration would reduce the cost of the deals . If the notes get such backing , they would carry a lower interest rate and also draw new bidders who are currently skeptical of the deals because of the uncertainty of the notes ' status . But the members were hardly convinced . " You suggest to us that we ought to transfer the full faith and credit of the government to you three gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the board members  --  Mr. Wall , Mr. White and Roger Martin . " But if you don ' t do ( the deals ) right , we can get thrown out of here . " It also was disclosed that the extent of fraud in the industry was greater than many had believed . The Bank Board said as many as one quarter of the institutions it sold last year involved some element of fraud , and that 6 , 100 criminal referrals were made in subsequent examinations . It ' s uncertain how many will be prosecuted . Congress and the Bank Board have been haggling for months over how to protect federally insured depositors in insolvent savings and loans . The Bank Board says the most-insolvent thrifts have been sold or merged , but about 400 are still insolvent , and hundreds more would fall into the red following an economic recession or some other adversity .
