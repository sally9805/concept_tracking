De la Madrid fulfills a pledge <P> During the election campaign last year Presidential Candidate Miguel de la Madrid pledged to bring about a " moral renovation " of Mexican society , including the investigation of former officials for corruption . In his seven months as President , however , De la Madrid has been criticized for moving slowly against suspect members of the administration of his predecessor , Jos Lopez Portillo , whose government was widely regarded as corrupt . Last week , in a move that created a nationwide sensation , the government accused Jorge Daz Serrano , 63 , former head of the state oil monopoly , Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) , and the " architect " of Mexico 's oil boom , of corruption . The charge : defrauding Pemex of $34 million in connection with the purchase of two Belgian natural gas tankers in 1980 . <P> A lifelong friend of the former President 's , Daz Serrano was once considered a possible successor to Lopez Portillo .

Later , after Lopez Portillo appointed him to be director-general of Pemex , Daz Serrano guided the huge oil exploration program that , in just five years , made Mexico the world 's fourth largest oil producer . <P> As Pemex chief , the flamboyant Daz Serrano often dealt bluntly with the U.S. As he once put it , " We aim to deal with the U.S. according to our program of energy . " In 1978 , while he was running Pemex , Mexico abruptly canceled a natural gas sale after the U.S. refused to meet the Pemex price . In June 1981 , after the worldwide oil glut had forced Mexico to lower its export price , Daz Serrano suddenly resigned from his Pemex post after his enemies charged that he had not cleared the price cut with Lopez Portillo . <P> Last week 's announcement astounded Mexican politicians , not only because of Daz Serrano 's prominence but also because of his closeness to Lopez Portillo . Many Mexicans saw the move as an indication that De la Madrid would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The word in Mexico City , however , is that the new government has decided at the " highest level " not to press for any legal action against Lopez Portillo himself .
