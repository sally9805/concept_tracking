Even for those born long after San Francisco 's great 1906 earthquake and fire , it had become a habit to recall the warm , breezy conditions during that cataclysm . Looking out a window from her home in suburban Sunnyvale , Neta Lott remarked to her husband Byron that the Indian-summer evening of Oct. 17 seemed like " darned good earthquake weather . " Moments later , the shaking and rolling began . Byron , an electrical engineer , fell to the floor . Neta tried to get up but remained pinned to her chair until she rolled onto the floor . " I sat under the desk and thought I would be buried , " she recalled . " I thought , ' This is it . I 'm going to die . ' " <P> To the north in Oakland , auto mechanic Richard Reynolds glanced at the traffic on the double-decker I-880 freeway across the street and urged a friend not to drive to night school until after the rush hour . Minutes later , Reynolds felt " a ripple . " Then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop to find " the whole goddam ground lifting up . " He grabbed a telephone pole as the sidewalk buckled beneath his feet , and looked up at a horrifying sight . A mile-long section of the freeway 's upper deck began to heave , then collapsed onto the lower roadway , flattening cars as if they were beer cans . " It just slid . It did n't fall . It just slid , " said Reynolds . " You could n't see nothing but dust . Then people came out of the dust . " But not many . Dozens of cars were crushed in the concrete sandwich . Officials hoped , against all odds , that most carried only one person . A mile or so away , engineer Bruce Stephan was driving home on the upper deck of the Bay Bridge . He gripped the steering wheel hard as the car bounced up and down , then plunged toward the water . A 50-ft. piece of roadway had broken off and fallen onto the lower deck , carrying him with it . " Janice , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger . But something caught the car , and they were able to crawl out the windows to safety . Don Laviletta , riding his motorcycle on the upper deck , described how the roadway bulged and rippled toward him " like bumper cars  --  only you could die in this game . " The driver of one car , in fact , was killed in the collapse . <P> In San Francisco 's yuppified Marina district , Emily Hudson was startled by the swinging of a chandelier , which struck the ceiling , then fell to the floor of her apartment . Her three-story building , with 18 apartments , cracked , splintered and toppled forward . " I could hear two women trapped in the apartment below me screaming , then I heard a voice yelling , ' Are you okay ? ' " the stockbroker 's assistant recalled . Shortly after a neighbor pulled her out of a smashed window into air filled with gas fumes , she heard three deafening explosions . Then she saw a " horrible , huge wall of flame . " Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing ten buildings was incinerated by gas-fed flames that shot 50 ft. into the sky .
