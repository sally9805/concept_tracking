When a mysterious contagion known as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome began to kill large numbers of people a few years ago , various moral authorities took solace in the observation that its victims , most of whom were homosexuals or drug addicts , seemed well chosen for divine retribution . Confronted with a lethal and seemingly unappeasable plague , enlightened man found himself grateful to discover a reassuring semblance of the wrath of God . As the numbers continued to mount and it became undeniable that even the morally immaculate were among the afflicted ? as they had been from the beginning ? it grew increasingly difficult to consign AIDS to its accustomed place as a pestilence of the lower depths . Only when Rock Hudson 's illness became known did the disease achieve the status of a full-fledged " social problem . " But the confirmation that viruses remain unimpressed by human pieties did not address the issue of how to slow the spread of a deadly and still puzzling disease . What exactly do we know about AIDS ? Given that knowledge , how can the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups that have been most affected ? Harper 's recently invited a group of public health officials , physicians , scientists , and medical historians to consider what can be done to contain a modern plague . JONATHAN LIEBERSON As everyone is aware by now , AIDS continues to run its appalling course . At the beginning of 1981 , the year AIDS was first recognized , there were fewer than sixty cases in the United States ; since then , there have been more than 12,000 . Every day more and more people are diagnosed as having a lethal condition for which , as yet , there seems to be no effective treatment . In view of the gravity of this situation , our task today is to review the facts about the epidemic and to discuss what factors influence society 's response to it . What precisely is known , and not known , about AIDS ? Have its cause and the means by which it is transmitted been definitely established ? Is there reason to expect that it will increasingly affect people in groups that have remained largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective treatment for AIDS ? Second , what policies should the United States and other nations adopt in dealing with this epidemic ? What in fact has been done by the U.S. government thus far ? What principles should guide public discussion of ways to control and contain the epidemic ! Under what conditions should we consider using measures that may raise troubling issues of privacy , confidentiality , and civil rights ? Has the government 's response been greatly influenced , as many charge , by the fact that most of those afflicted with AIDS are homosexuals or drug addicts ! Finally , how has society responded to AIDS ? How will it respond as the number of patients continues to rise ? And how will the spread of AIDS influence sexual attitudes in general ? Dr. Silverman , how many people are currently afflicted with AIDS , who are they , and how fast is it spreading ? MERVYN F. SILVERMAN : As of August 12 , 12,408 people in the United States had been reported as having AIDS ; 6,212 had died . The number of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within certain well-defined " high-risk " groups which emerged early on in the epidemic . According to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta , gay and bisexual men constitute 73 percent of AIDS patients nationwide ; intravenous drug abusers make up 17 percent ; transfusion recipients 2 percent ; and hemophiliacs one percent . Heterosexuals who have had sexual contact with members of high-risk groups make up another one percent , and the remaining AIDS cases are classified as " non-characteristic . " It is expected there will he more than 30,000 cases by the end of 1986 . MATH1LDE KRIM : It should be emphasized that these figures include only cases of the disease as defined by the CDC . This narrow definition applies to a relatively small proportion of cases within a much larger population of diseased people . Those numbers , however frightening , represent the tip of the iceberg . The condition now known as AIDS was first recognized in 1981 when an unusual form of pneumonia , Pneumocystis carinii , killed five young men in Los Angeles . All five were homosexual and suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they lacked T-4 lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell that is essential to defending the body against infections . As the number of cases began to grow , physicians saw this pattern repeated : all people with AIDS had a severely impaired immune system that left them vulnerable to rare " opportunistic " infections and cancers , particularly Kaposi 's sarcoma . This association of different diseases , several of which often strike the same patient simultaneously , constitutes a " syndrome . " The conglomeration of illnesses was apparently made possible by anunderlying immunodeficiency that the heretofore healthy patients had somehow " acquired . " Thus , Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome , or AIDS . For two years , researchers focused on identifying the cause of the immune deficiency . Meanwhile , the CDC 's nationwide surveillance showed that the disease was concentrated in the high-risk groups Dr. Silverman named . Researchers noted that members of these groups tend to be exposed to various infections or allogeneic cells such as foreign blood cells or sperm ? both of which can damage the immune system ; some even speculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . But other researchers believed an infectious agent might he involved . In April 1984 , Dr. Luc Montagnier 's group at the Pasteur Institute in Paris isolated a virus that he called " **26;3995;TOOLONG virus , " or LAV , because it had been found in a patient with chronically swollen lymph glands . Less than a year later , Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Institutes of Health isolated a virus from an AIDS patient that he called " human T-cell lymphotrophic virus , type three , " or HTLV-III . The two viruses were later found to be virtually identical , and thus the virus now thought to cause ? or at least be one cause of ? AIDS is known as LAWHILV-III . LIEBERSON : But AIDS patients are susceptible to all sorts of infections . What proof is there that this particular virus causes the disease ? KRIM : LAV/HTLV411 has a strong predilection for infecting and growing in T-4 cells when studied in the laboratory . And it has been found in virtually all patients suffering from AIDS itself or from the lesser forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Gallo 's group was able to develop a blood test , called the EL1SA test , which indicates whether someone has been exposed to the virus . This test does not detect disease , only the antibodies formed when someone has been exposed ro LAV/HTLV-Ill . But it can be used to screen contaminated blood from the blood supply and to estimate the spread of the virus . For example , surveys show that in New York City , as many as 80 percent of IV drug users , as many as 60 percent of healthy gay men , and one out of every thousand healthy blood donors have been infected . These numbers probably vary from city to city , but the CDC has estimated that a million people might already have been infected nationwide . While infection with the virus seems necessary for the occurrence of AIDS , it is n't clear whether it 's sufficient to cause it . The great majority of those with the virus as yet show no symptoms . On the other hand , the incubation period for AIDS may be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , many who are sick are not considered to have AIDS . According to the CDC 's definition , one must not only show an acquired immune deficiency but be afflicted with one or more of certain specified opportunistic infections , or with certain cancers . Yet many infected people exhibit a broad range of symptoms , from persistent low-grade fever , unexplained weight loss , and swollen lymph glands to various degrees of immune deficiency sometimes associated with infections and cancers other than those specified by the CDC . LIEBERSON : Would it be correct to refer to these manifestations as " pre-AIDS , " as some have ? KRIM : No , " pre-AIDS " implies that these symptoms inevitably lead to AIDS . Yet many patients have had them for several years and have not gone on to develop AIDS . The symptoms constitute a condition that is now referred to as AIDS-related complex , or ARC . There may he ten ARC patients for every one AIDS patient . RONALD BAYER : Current estimates are that between 5 percent and 2C percent of those infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS within the next five years . This means there might eventually be as many as 200,000 terribly ill people in this country . KRIM : The problem with those percentages is that we have nor followed any of these infected people for more than about five years . Since AIDS can rake so long to appear after infection , the percentage of those infected who will develop the full-blown syndrome may be much higher than we think . And of course as we speak , the million Americans who are infected are going about the business of transmitting the virus ? studies show that at least two thirds of those with the virus are capable of infecting others . So there may well be many more than 200,000 cases . GERALD FRIEDLAND : What often happens with a new disease is that the lethal cases ? the most dramatic ones are counted first . Yet these represent only the top of a pyramid beneath which extend a majority of infected people who exhibit a broad spectrum of symptoms , or none at all . Because AIDS is such a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serious disease to lethal disease is n't clear . The 5 percent to 20 percent estimate is based on the current epidemiological evidence . Yet , as Dr. Krim said , the incubation period could be much longer than the disease 's history itself . The virus could get into a cell and remain dormant . And then , ten or fifteen years later , some biostress might cause it to manifest itself . But we ca n't know yet , because we are making history now . SILVERMAN : What makes the virus manifest itself ? Each of the stages between the mildest sign of LAV/HTLV-III infection ? which may simply be a positive blood test ? and AIDS as defined by the CDC represents a greater deterioration of the immune system . In order to develop any of these manifestations , or perhaps even to be infected in the first place , a co-factor of some sort is probably necessary . Since those who develop the disease fall into groups that tend to have compromised immune systems , an existing weakness in the immune system seems the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug abusers have destroyed , or at least attacked , their immune systems . People who need blood transfusions tend to be in very difficult straits and probably have weakened immune systems , as do hemophiliacs , who receive blood products from thousands of people during their lifetime . LIEBERSON : But why have homosexuals constituted the majority of cases from the beginning ? And what is meant by " homosexual " here ! What kind of homosexual ? What groups ? GARY MACDONALU Good Lord , are there more than ten kinds ? We should have invited Dr. Kinsey . " Gay or bisexual men " refers to a group of males , largely between the ages of twenty and fifty , who have sex with other males . LIEBERSON : I was n't looking for a definition of homosexuality . Given the fact that members of the high-risk groups tend to have pre-existing immune deficiencies , are we speaking about any homosexual , or only those who engage in certain practices ? SILVERMAN : Gay men tend to have compromised immune systems for a couple of reasons . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced into the bloodstream through breaks in mucous membranes . Second , gay men , especially " fast-lane " gays who have many sexual . partners , generally have a lot of infecdons , which weaken their immune systems . KRIM ; Certain sexual acts also seem to facilitate transmission of the virus . In particular , anal-receptive intercourse may facilitate both transmission by letting infected sperm into the bloodstream ? and an immunological reaction to that sperm . MACDONALD : Look , I think the moment may have arrived to desexualize this disease . AIDS is not a " gay disease , " despite its epidemiology . Yet we homosexualize ir , and by so doing end up . posing the wrong questions . There is no evidence to support the notion that gay men in general are immunocompromised because they engage in anal intercourse , despite the fact that semen itself may be immunosuppressive in some circumstances . And gay men have been doing this for centuries with no dire results . Is n't the point really that an infectious agent has been introduced into the gay male population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , is spreading there. ? There is nothing inherent in being gay that promotes this disease ; after all , the number of cases with , in each high-risk group appears to be increasing at the same rate . AIDS is not transmitted because of who you are , but because of what you do . From the beginning , 17 percent of AIDS patients have been IV drug users , and at least 6 percent have never fit into any of the high-risk groups . In New Jersey , the majority of AIDS patients are IV drug users . By concentrating on gay and bisexual men , people are able to ignore the fact that this disease has been present in what has charmingly come to be called " the general population " from the beginning . It was not spread from one of the other groups . It was there . FRIEDLAND : The majority of our patients in the Bronx are IV drug users , and a quarter are women who have contracted the disease either by using dirty needles or by having sex with infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at least 10 percent of AIDS sufferers are gay and use IV drugs . Yet they are automatically counted in the homosexual and bisexual men category , regardless of what might be known ? or not known ? about how they became infected . In their desire to keep AIDS in its place as a , ' gay disease , " people ignore the fact that in Central Africa , the sexual spread of the disease occurs almost solely among heterosexuals ; slightly more women than men are infected . At the university hospital in Kinshasa , the capital of Zaire , three or four AIDS cases are coming in every day . Interestingly enough , in some places where the virus is prevalent , there is virtually no disease . For example , scientists have found that as many as 51 percent of the people in some remote tribes in northern Kenya are infected ? but there 's no AIDS . They 're finding the virus in green monkeys in Zaire as well , yet they do n't seem to be sick . SILVERMAN : It 's possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has only recently mutated and begun to infect humans . Or it may have been present in humans in isolated regions of Africa for years . Perhaps it began to spread as more roads were built and people moved to the cities . Today , jet travel can spread a disease around the world almost instantly . MACDONALD : The outbreak in Western Europe seems to be following the American model : the largest group affected is gay and bisexual men , followed by IV drug users , and then heterosexuals . The number of cases is increasing rapidly , particularly in France and West Germany . LIEBERSON : What precisely do we know about how the disease is spread ? KRIM : The virus is probably not spread by casual contact ? kissing or living in the same household or sitting near someone on a bus . But it is transmissible sexually and through the blood . It is less contagious than hepatitis or flu . SILVERMAN : People seem to think AIDS is some virus from a Steven Spielberg movie ? a super-virus . Well , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LAV/HTLV-Ill is sexually transmitted precisely because it is so fragile . LIEBERSON : Does " sexually transmitted " mean that a person who has sex with someone who has the virus is likely to get it ? FRLEDLAND : Frankly , we have no idea how likely it is that the virus would be transmitted during any single sexual encounter . Someone may have to be exposed several times to be infected . STEPHEN SCHULTZ : We know the virus is present in body fluids , but we do n't know which of them are effective transmitters . Just because the virus is found in saliva does n't mean saliva transmits it . Many public health officials have taken the conservative approach and assumed that if the virus is present in any body fluid , every attempt should be made to avoid spreading it around . FRIEDLAND : To obtain biological proof of how the virus is transmitted , as opposed to epidemiological proof ? which is essentially circumstantial evidence ? we would have to take infected body fluids , inject them into subjects , and wait for infection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , researchers must find an animal that can become infected with the virus and duplicate the disease . Work in this area began only recently . Today , we can only make admittedly circumstantial assumptions about how the virus is transmitted . SILVERMAN : Epidemiologically speaking , one could say that semen appears more likely to transmit the virus than saliva . The two factors associated with transmission seem to be multiple sex partners , which suggests that a number of exposures might be necessary , and anal-receptive intercourse , which suggests that semen is a likely transmitter . FRIEDLAND : The cleaner epidemiologic information derived from transfusion studies confirms that blood can transmit the virus . In some cases , the original blood donors of people who have acquired the disease have been located , and the virus in their blood isolated . These transfusion studies give us our most reliable evidence about the disease 's incubation period . The multiple sexual encounters of many gay and bisexual men , for example . or the numerous episodes of needle-sharing among drug addicts , usually make it impossible to determine when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases back to blood donors , we do n't know how many recipients of that blood did not become infected . Not everyone given a transfusion with infected blood develops antibodies . SILVERMAN : Retrospective studies of any disease usually give us fairly definite information about transmission . But with AIDS , we 're just now building that body of information . MACDONALD : Still , there are no data suggesting the virus is transmissible by casual contact or through saliva . If it were , we would undoubtedly be seeing a markedly greater number of cases than we have so far . SILVERMAN : And the numbers of AIDS patients , though doubling every year , are doubling within the high-risk groups . No mothers of AIDS patients have gotten it , for example . KRIM : An even stronger argument is that there has been no recorded transmission of the virus between AIDS patients and medical personnel . SILVERMAN : The point is that AIDS is predominantly a sexually transmitted disease , and that means it 's a behavioral disease . People who do n't do certain things very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain things risk getting it . KRIM : This means that the infection ? and therefore A1DS ? is essentially preventable , not by medical means as vet but by changing how people behave . People must be taught how to protect themselves from getting the virus . That is the great failing of our government : it has made no real effort to provide this education . ALLAN M. BRANDT : That raises the question of how very rational fears of what is after all a terrifying disease can be separated from the powerful , irrational fears that are spreading across the country . Despite the scientific uncertainty , emerging epidemiological data tell us a good deal about why we need not fear AIDS under certain circumstances . Yet this information has gotten lost in the public portrayal of the disease . SCHULTZ : Look at the press , which has been pointing its finger at prostitutes and warning heterosexuals that they run a " grave risk " of catching AIDS . The cover of Life proclaimed " Now No One Is Safe from AIDS " in big red letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful , which , while literally true , tends to worry people unduly . The evidence that AIDS is spreading outside the high-risk groups , beyond the percentage of " noneharacteristic " cases we 've always seen , is negligible . MACDONALD : Only because the gay aspect of the disease has been so sensationalized can people say , four years after the epidemic broke out , my goodness , heterosexuals are at risk too . The disease seems to have " broken out " in the general population , but that 's only because we have not really talked about AIDS before ? its epidemiology , modes of transmission , and so on . Before , when discussing AIDS , we were really talking about attitudes toward homosexuality , or something else altogether . SILVERMAN : Only one percent of all AIDS cases can definitely be traced to-sexual transmission between men and women . But this might be changing . Eighty-six percent of AIDS patients in San Francisco are homosexual or bisexual men who are not IV drug abusers ? as opposed to 59 percent in New York City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are infected seems to be rising . If a man has sex with a woman who has contracted the virus by using dirty needles , he could become infected . So we may start seeing inure cases among heterosexuals in San Francisco . FETTNER . The press keeps talking about hookers ? how they get it from dirty needles and spread it to their customers . But do we know exactly how they spread it ? SILVERMAN ; The cost per case in San Francisco is probably half that figure . San Francisco is spending about $4 million this year on outpatient services for AIDS patients . The idea is to reduce the hoSpital stay and care for patients in their homes with skilled nurses and other support staff . The average hospital . stay in San Francisco for an AIDS patient is about eleven days , which is much less than in New York . This system reduces total AIDS expenditures immensely . But its enormously costly for the local government , because charges are not reimbursed by Medicaid or other programs . Yet the federal government considers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reduce total costs . Meanwhile , New York and San Francisco , because of the quality of care they provide , now attract AIDS patients from across the country . BAYER . The fact is that our health care system does n't provide adequate care for large numbers of people . How can we provide money for longterm care for AIDS patients ? We ca n't provide it for the elderly or the homeless . SHEBAR : The whole question of federal involvement is a double-edged sword , particularly when it comes to prevention programs . Asked how to " prevent " AIDS , the man on the street might demand rather draconian measures . Some right-wing spokesmen have already advocated the mandatory quarantine of AIDS patients . Officials in the Reagan Administration might believe they 're being rather evenhanded when it comes to AIDS : Well , they say , we may not he giving much money to those gays for education , but at least we 're not locking them up , as Jerry Falwell keeps demanding . SCHULTZ : Those on the radical right are n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public health profession . EETTNER : Quarantine is not some sort of paranoid gay fantasy . James Mason , head of the CDC and acting assistant secretary for health , has conceded that it has been discussed by federal officials . KRIM : A quarantine would not only be terribly cruel and harmful , but also completely counterproductive . After all , the only people who could be forcibly committed to a hospital are diagnosed AIDS patients showing clinical symptoms . Yet these people are very ill , and they are usually not interested in sex . And the more advanced their condition , the less infectious they become . The people most likely to infect others with the virus are those who have been infected but do not evidence symptoms . They think of themselves as healthy ; for all we know , they may never get sick . SILVERMAN : Besides the obvious ethical issues this raises , if we tried to lock up all those infected , we would have to imprison upward of a million people , most of whom are not sick . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would have to give everyone in the country a blood test , and isolate all those who tested positive ? some of whom , of course , would test false-positive . BAYER : It 's clear mass qiirantine could n't work , at least not in a way that would benefit public health ; but it would have a profound effect on civil liberties . Many less extreme measures have also been discussed , and because they are more plausible , they are even more troubling . For example , some have proposed mandatory screening for AIDS in schools , in the military , in places of employment . It 's not unreasonable to expect that many who are deeply concerned about public health ? and not necessarily rightwingers ? will begin to discuss this possibility . If nothing else , such a discussion might help us confront the fact that in some sense we have lost the ability to consider " the public " when we debate public health issues . The concern for privacy , civil liberties , and constitutional rights has become so pre-eminent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what point these individual protections might be compromised in the name of public health . SILVERMAN : 1 disagree . Officials must simply look at these issues logically and intelligently . If they do , they 'll see , for example , that there is no real point in mandatory mass screening . The disease is not casually spread , so there is no reason for an employer to screen his employees , except perhaps to avoid paying out insurance money . The military already screens all blood it collects on its bases . Commanding officers are informed when someone tests positive for LAV/HTLV-Ill ? apparently not for health reasons , but so he may be discharged for being a homosexual . SHEBAR : If the military discharges someone because he has AIDS , it has violated the law . But if it discharges someone ? on the basis , of the same test ? because he is a huirloseXual , it 's within the law . MACDONALD : But the test is often inaccurate , and in any case , , a positive test does n't indicate a person has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been exposed to the virus and has built up antibodies to fight it . In New Jersey it was recently proposed that anyone giving blood whose antibody test was positive be informed , and that blood banks be required to report test results to the state . But certainly the government should intervene only when it can do something constructive . What can it do for someone who tests positive ? BAYER : It is not unreasonable to assume that once public health officials notified someone that he had tested positive , he would have a moral obligation to behave prudently when he had sexual contact with others . MACDONALD : But a test result is not required to give that message to members of high-risk groups . SILVERMAN : Well , it definitely makes that message more effective . That 's why I 'm in favor of people in high-risk groups ? gays and bisexuals , IV drug abusers ? taking the blood test . Someone who has a positive test can at least come in for counseling . What do we tell him ? First , the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not get AIDS . Second , there are steps you can take to help ensure that you stay healthy . Above all , build up your immune system : follow a good diet , get a lot of rest and exercise . Most important , make sure you do n't expose yourself to the virus again ? and , for God 's sake , do n't expose any . one else . To someone who tests negative , we can offer advice on how to stay that way : build up the immune system and behave in ways that do n't increase the risk of exposure . And , as 1 ) r . Krim mentioned , if we begin treating people ar an earlier stage of the infection , we may be able to accomplish something with treatment . LIEBERSON : What 's the possibility of the test indicating someone has the virus when he does n't ? ERIEDLAND Any test has its " false-positive " rate . In screening IV drug users in New York City ? up to 80 percent of whom may have the virus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're screening a population that has a relatively law frequency of infection , the test 's false-positive rate may actually be higher than the true rate of infection of the group . So a given positive test is more likely to be false-positive than it is to indicate infection . This is why it 's problematic to . screen large numbers of people who arc unlikely to be infected . BAYER : But more elaborate confirmatory tests like the Western Blot have been developed , and they are very reliable . When such tests are used , the rate of false-positives is negligible . SCHULTZ : However accurate the test , many argue that if effective treatment for the disease is n't available , then screening people is immoral . Between the wars , the United States screened much of its population for syphilis -- hut it had only a very ineffective therapy to offer . BRANDT . Premarital screening for syphilis has been mandatory in most states for years , and we know now that test results in the past were often Use-positives . Yet many people who tested positive were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's interesting that Dr. Silverman said we should tell people who test positive to behave in a certain way , and people who test negative to behave in a certain way ? the same way , in fact . That suggests to me that the main purpose of testing people would be to frighten them , rather than to offer them effective treatment . Government officials , physicians , and others have traditionally hoped that fear of venereal disease would prevent it ? by preventing " illicit " sex . But historically , fear has never been enough to prevent venereal disease . SILVERMAN : Well , fear has been one hell of an effective motivator in the gay community . Yet our statistics show that the change in behavior has been quantitative rather than qualitative : people have reduced the number of their sexual partners , but some have not changed their sexual activity , at least not to the same extent . But sex with three people today may provide as much exposure as sex with a dozen people did three years ago , because so many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco . I concede that screening ? and I mean voluntary screening , not mandatory ? can be misused . But 1 believe it can he effective as an educational tool just like showing a smoker an X-ray of his lungs . SHEBAR : Behind such cynicism must lie the hope that everyone in the gay community will test positive ? what a great motivator that would be ! Among our clients at the Gay Men 's Health Crisis Center who committed suicide , three times as many were suffering from ARC as from AIDS itself . It 's the waiting , the checking for symptoms every day , that 's so terrible . Every cold seems like a sign of the end . The blood test does not diagnose disease . It does not suggest any treatment . And it is extraordinarily dangerous in its implications for civil rights . Last summer , I got a call from a man who had been given an annual physical by his employer ? a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical corporation ? and had been tested without his knowledge for the LAV/HTLV-III antibody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , told him he had tested positive for the antibody , and summarily fired him . This man had no idea what the test meant . I helped him get his job back and have the test result deleted from his medical records . SILVERMAN : To prevent such abuses , California just passed a law forbidding use of the test in screening employees or insurance applicants . MACDONALD : The implications of mass screening are frightening . When a bureaucracy like the Public Health Service is given a very simple task ? and screening blood is a very simple task ? it tends to reduce a complex phenomenon to very simple formulas : if someone tests positive , thus and thus is true ; if someone tests negative , thus and thus is true . The bureaucracy does n't pay attention to whether anything is really being accomplished . Look at the Red Cross 's policy of sending people with confirmed positive results to their physicians . Their physicians ca n't do anything . FETTNER : The Red Cross is also putting the names of those who test positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something called a deferral directory , which lists anyone whose blood has been rejected for medical or other reasons . Its purpose is basically to screen out blood that may not he safe . Of course any kind of list , whatever its purpose , presents a problem . The Red Cross list presents a particular problem for those who believe that individuals should not be notified of positive results because they might be terrified by information that is not necessarily accurate . At present , a blood donor is notified only if both the ELISA screen test and the confirmatory Western Blot test are positive . If someone tests positively on the ELISA but negatively on the Western Blot , his blood is nor used and his name appears on the deferral list ? hut he is not notified . This list presents the problem , especially since no computer list can be absolutely confidential . Arc health care professionals ethically hound to tell people their names are on the list , even though it has not been confirmed that they have the antibody ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
