Abutting heavily black Detroit , the predominantly white suburb of Dearborn has earned an unsavory reputation as one of America 's more segregated communities . Conditions have not changed appreciably since the 1980 census showed only 83 blacks among Dearborn 's 90,660 residents . The city 's lily-white makeup was maintained by Mayor Orville Hubbard , a chest-thumping racist who ruled Dearborn 's city hall from 1942 to 1978 . Although Hubbard died in 1982 , his legacy was hauntingly present last week as civil rights activists expanded a boycott of local stores to protest efforts to bar nonresidents from most of Dearborn 's 39 parks . <P> At issue was an ordinance , passed by referendum last November , that threatens nonresidents who invade the parks with fines of up to $500 or jail sentences of up to 90 days . Dearborn residents said they were forced into acting because they were being crowded out of recreation facilities they pay for . Said William Peretto , 39 , whose son Scott could not get into a municipal swimming pool last summer because it was mobbed : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , the ordinance served to spotlight the area 's long-standing racial divide . Civil rights leaders saw it as a clumsy move to keep out blacks from Detroit . In retaliation , the N.A.A.C.P. organized a boycott of Dearborn 's stores , including those at Fairlane Town Center , a 2,360-acre complex that includes the state 's largest shopping mall . Before the boycott , an estimated 28% of Fairlane 's shoppers were black . Says the Rev. Charles Adams , minister of Hartford Memorial Baptist Church and head of the Detroit N.A.A.C.P. : " They welcome us to shop in their stores , but do n't allow us to stop in their parks . If we 're not good enough to stop , we feel we 're too good to shop . " <P> By last week the dispute over the parks ordinance had expanded into a more general grievance over the dearth of commercial facilities in Detroit . During the past decade the city has lost most of its famous retailers , and black leaders hope a boycott will pressure merchants to provide convenient outlets for the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged Detroiters to use the Lenten season to abstain from shopping at all stores in the suburbs , not just the ones in Dearborn . " Do n't shop anywhere but in Detroit , " he told his congregation . " If you ca n't find it here , do without it . " <P> The call for Detroit-only shopping is expected to have limited success , even among blacks who have been insulted by Dearborn 's racial attitudes . Fred Morgan , 39 , a Detroit truck driver , long ago dropped the idea of buying a house in Dearborn , in part because he felt unwelcome . But he still will shop there . " I was out last night looking for an air compressor , " he said . " Where am I going to get one in Detroit for the kind of price I can find in the suburbs ? "
