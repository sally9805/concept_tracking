ANNALS OF DISCOURSE THE HARVARD BLACK ROCK FOREST BILTMORE IT is my plan to begin in the middle of things , with a man alone on a tract of land . It is 1892 . The man is young and healthy ; the land has been damaged . The young man is a forester , hired to work on this land . Now he is joined by a second young man , the owner of the land  --  a young man who is enormously rich . To  --  gether they look around at the tract of damaged land , which could have been damaged by anyone ; then they look up at a house that is being built . It is an astonishing house : only a rich person could build it . All the rest of this essay takes place within the set of circumstances I have just described : two friends , one a for  --  ester , one an enormously rich young man , looking first at a large tract of damaged land and then at an astonish- in limestone palace . The young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first American to be trained as a forester , and , I think , one of the important men in the history of the United States . The young man who joins him is George Washington Vanderbilt , of that rich family . As an old man , Gif  --  ford Pinchot wrote a description of George Washington Vanderbilt as he was at the time of the building of the limestone house , called Biltmore : George was a lover of art and of the great outdoors , a slim , simple , and rather shy young man , too much and too long sheltered by female relatives .... Biltmore was his heart 's delight . Pinchot described the tract of land , near Asheville , North Carolina : Biltmore Estate covered a little over 7000 acres of rolling hills and bottom lands on both sides of the French Broad River . Half of it was woodland . It had been put together from small impoverished farms , the forest on which had been burned , slashed , and overgrazed until it was little more than the shadow of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but millions of acres cast of the Mississippi were its brothers and sisters . Pinchot described the limestone house : Biltmore House , the center of the Van  --  derbilt estate , not yet completed when I saw it first , was a magnificent ch  --  teau of Indiana limestone . With the terrace and stables it was a thousand feet in length . Its setting was superb , the view from it breath-taking , and as a feudal castle it would have been beyond criticism , and perhaps beyond praise . But in the United States of the nine  --  teenth century and among the one-room cabins of the Appalachian mountaineers , it did not belong . The contrast was a devas  --  tating commentary on the injustice of con  --  centrated wealth . Even in the early nine  --  ties I had sense enough to see that . The rich young man who had the palace built , however , also put his for  --  est under management . Pinchot wrote : Here was my chance . Biltmore could be made to prove what America did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest preserved at one and the same time . When I said that I thought that Gifford Pinchot was one of the impor  --  tant men in the history of the United States , I was thinking not only of his importance in the history of forestry and conservation but , even more , of his quality of mind . He was an ama  --  teur . At all moments in his career , he was fond of wearing a wide-brimmed slouch hat that made him look like a Westerner and an Easterner both . At all moments in his career , he failed to please one professional or another who was in possession of : the facts  --  political  --  cal , scientific , or practical . Now we are living with a hunger for certainty . We want to be certain . Or , rather , we are hungry for certainty , but , despairing of attaining it ourselves , we want to know that someone else is certain . If this should change  --  that is , if we allow ourselves to doubt consciously whether we can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of how men like Gifford Pinchot looked at American life . One thing Gifford Pinchot under  --  stood was that in America an effective man must not blame farmers who damage their land or very rich young men who want to build ( and some  --  times do build ) limestone palaces . He may have learned some part of this from Frederick Law Olmsted , the landscape architect , who also worked at Biltmore , and who guided and en  --  couraged him . " It was Mr. Olmsted who was responsible for the plan to make Biltmore Estate the nest egg for practical Forestry in America , " Pin  --  chot wrote , and he explained : Mr. Olmsted was to me one of the men of the century . He was a quiet-spoken little lame man with a most magnificent head and one of the best minds I have ever had the good luck to encounter . His knowledge was far wider than his profes  --  sion . He knew the territory of the United States as few men knew it , and he was full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento , California one day in the early fifties , Mr. Olmsted no  --  ticed a single figure standing out in the open plaza . The figure in the plaza was amusing himself by taking pot shots with a pistol at every man he saw . Presently a man walked straight out to the shooter , who was shouting , raging drunk , and took his gun away . The man who did this bravest thing was a gambler who had given clothes taken from smallpox victims to peaceful and harmless Digger Indians  --  a form of mur  --  der as low and contemptible as the gam  --  bler 's courage was high and fine . That story did me a lot of good . It shed a light on human nature that has helped me ever since not to underestimate people I do n't like . THE DUAL HIERARCHY WE LIVE IN EVERYONE lives somewhere , but not everyone feels that he is liv  --  ing in one particular place . The man on the street with an earphone-con  --  nected-to-music in his ear  --  where is he living ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome the limitations implicit in living in one place . Already , I need a distinction : between the person who is thought  --  lessly impelled to place a popular-culture webbing over the place where he is and the person who sees that his work , when it is most success  --  ful , is everywhere and nowhere . Both persons have noticed that when an event is merely somewhere it has failed . To be successful now , one would want to be a person whose work was dispersed throughout the world but who lived ( nevertheless ) in a collegial atmosphere . Scientists and entertainers do this . It is the work of scientists and entertainers which has been most thoroughly dispersed throughout the modern world , and yet scientists and entertainers live in a collegial atmo  --  sphere , within which the work of an ambitious man is likely to be known to another ambitious man . Thus , history survives within the history of science and the history of entertainment  --  especially the history of entertainment on film . Silent films , vaudeville turns , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not intend to do vaudeville or direct B pictures or make pictures without sound . In the same way , scientists know and make use of the work of men whose theories have been overthrown . A collegial situation in which a ? sense of history leads men to respect work a layman would ignore is rare now . The collegial atmosphere around the work of lawyers is thinner than it used to be , and around the work of literary men it is very thin ; this is a measure of the loss of vitality in these two spheres . Traditions are main  --  tained by collegial bodies that retain vitality and direct part of their vital energy to the protection of parts of themselves which would be ignored by a layman . Americans are not , as is sometimes said , a people without tradi  --  tions ; our traditions are being formed within science and entertainment . The vast majority of people do not see evidence of a collegial enterprise in what they encounter either on the sur  --  face of life ( where the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dreams ( formed by entertainment ) . The world is not familiar from the point of view of knowledge ; nor does its mys  --  tery give birth to healthy aspirations . Rather , the lives of most people are characterized by attempts to make the world familiar through the application ? of affection , and by nonsensical aspira  --  tions : attempts to reach images in the air and to take part in events in the sky . But scientists and entertainers do see evidence of sense and of a collegial spirit in what is around them , and this convinces them that there is more structure in the lives of people than there really is . Consider the example of a filmmaker whose film about gang  --  sters is being shown on television . He knows the film , of course , and he knows other films of the genre , and he knows how television works ; that is , he could explain how his film came to be shown on television and what peo  --  ple were involved . He may not know anything about gangsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of being fooled by some of his own work ( he may be imitating the work of other , greater men , whose work he is incapable of understanding ) , but a partial delusion does not make the ex  --  perience of watching the film a crazy one for him : he may even transform what does not make sense into a sensi ble ambition to know and do more . For him , the explicable and the mys  --  terious are in contact , as they are for all men who are involved in a ritual and are taking it seriously . For a child , the experience of watching this film is completely differ  --  ent . The explicable and the mysterious are not in contact . The mystery that the filmmaker consciously refers to in his film and the mystery of which he is not conscious ( his delusion : the result of not understanding his own work ) ? these mysteries are not important , or even perceptible , to the child , who is under the weight of the questions " What is television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " One definition of a ritual would be : a cir  --  cumstance in which images fall into an order that makes deep sense . One defi  --  nition of television would be : an unsuccess  --  ful ritual ; or a ritual that works only for the priests . Science , like enter  --  tainment , is found in layers , in a hierarchy , throughout the world . From a scientific point of view , there are im  --  portant connections be  --  tween the most repel  --  lent application of a degraded technology and the most sublime speculation . This be  --  ing true , the conse  --  consequences of the degrad  --  ed technology are , per  --  haps , slightly less re  --  pellent to a scientist than they would be to a sensitive nonscien  --  tist . What joins the scientist and the en  --  tertainer is this : they create the modern world but do not live in it , while other people live in it with  --  out knowing much about how it has been made . WITHIN AN OLDER HIERARCHY IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Route 9W in the small , de  --  cayed city of New ? burgh , on the west bank of the Hud  --  son , Hamilton Fish , of that distin  --  guished New York family , Harvard Class of 1910 , former member of Con  --  congress , said to the air in front of him , " I have too much money now . I 'm embarrassed . " It is the habit of some people whose final reference is to cer  --  tainty to speak to the air in front of them . " It 's true , " Mr. Fish said . " I 'm embarrassed . " It was not true . Mr. Fish was referring to his third wife , who is rich and with whom he was at this moment living in a nine  --  teenth-century house overlooking the Hudson near Newburgh . This was a change for Mr. Fish , whose family has had strong connections in Garri  --  son , over on the east bank of the river . The Newburgh house is handsome on the outside . Inside , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each tree carries a small tag giving its proper name , or is meant to carry one . " Still , " Mr. Fish said , into the air , " charity can be very dangerous . My first wife 's father gave a great deal of money to Williams College and then had very little left for himself . " Mr. Fish opened his eyes wide , and so opened wide his big face . This he did to add emphasis to the words " had very little left for himself . " Mr. Fish , in his nineties , is extremely hand  --  some  --  tall , with a famous nose and famous eyes . His late sister Rosalind Fish Cutler had eyes even bigger , the wonder of her friends and family , but Mr. Fish 's career has been pub  --  lic , so his eyes are better known . Travelling south on 9W , the automobile crossed the principal thoroughfare of the small , decayed city of Newburgh . There was silence in the au  --  tomobile as it crossed this strong street , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighty-two feet wide . After cross  --  ing Broadway , the automobile followed the dispersal of the small city of New  --  burgh . After a time , a man in the front seat said , " Do you think New  --  burgh will come back , Uncle Ham ? " " No , " Mr. Fish said . ROUTE 9W proceeds south of New  --  burgh through the old town of New Windsor and into the Hudson Highlands . When one is travelling south , Storm King Mountain is off to the left . To the right is the Har  --  vard Black Rock For  --  est , a tract of thirty-eight hundred acres which was developed as a scientific , or demon  --  stration , forest by Dr. Ernest G. Stillman , a benefactor of Harvard ; he endowed the forest and left it to Harvard at his death , in 1949 . Farther south , a trav  --  eller may turn oft the United States Military Academy , at West Point . The Hudson Highlands are merely fifty miles from New York City , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point Military Reserva  --  tion ; within Storm King State Park , which is a part of the Palisades In  --  terstate Park ; and with  --  in the Harvard Black Rock Forest . Of Harvard and its relationship to the Black Rock Forest , to the Still  --  man family of benefac  --  tors , to the science of silviculture ( within a demonstration forest ) , it should be said that , in response to the new , tough reality in Ameri  --  can life , Harvard Uni  --  versity has been looking closely , ruthlessly at its assets . Where an asset does not per  --  form , it is suspect . Recently , Harvard University decided that the Black Rock Forest , the tract of thirty-eight hundred acres within the Hudson Highlands given to it by Dr. Ernest Stillman ( a benefactor from a family of benefactors ) , had not performed and should be sold . There were difficulties . It was not possible to say that the for  --  est was a burden , for instance . The ex  --  penses of upkeep were light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runaway fuel costs and other such aspects of the new , tough reality were absent . Expenses had not outstripped income . Most emphatically , they had not . Income rose and rose and rose . At moments , it must have been embar  --  rassing how much money Harvard had available to be spent within the forest . This money derived from a fund es  --  tablished by Dr. Ernest Stillman pri  --  marily to support the expenses of maintaining the forest and the ex  --  penses of conducting scientific work within the forest ; the fund amounted to about a million dollars at the time of Dr. Stillman 's death , in 1949 . It amounts to more than that now . Har  --  vard has said that although it is not possible for Harvard to keep the forest it is possible for it to keep the money . HAMILTON FISH ( Harvard ' 10 ) and his companions were on their way to a meeting of Harvard men . Their trip took them through the old , decayed city of Newburgh and through the Hudson Highlands  --  where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund-raiser , connected to an effort by the President and Fel  --  lows of Harvard College to raise ( at first ; they asked for a hundred million more later ) the sum of two hundred and fifty million dollars . It was held at a hotel on the grounds of the United States Military Academy . There was a view of the Hudson River ( very nar  --  row here ) . There were talks by three men , and there was a film . THE collegial atmosphere around the men of Harvard is thin now . It is thinner than the atmosphere around lawyers , not so thin as the atmosphere around literary people . It becomes thick , richer in oxygen , more nearly capable of sustaining life , dur  --  ing fund-raising periods . Men are in  --  jected into buildings ; their money is mortar . Buildings reveal that they were built by men and have always housed people . Everything is named . " The Names of Harvard " is a booklet issued at this fund-raising period to set out the details of the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak the name of some person . AT the meeting attended by Mr. Fish and his companions , there were three kinds of talk : ( 1 ) Talk in imitation of a backwater patois , from one speaker . ( 2 ) Tough , simple talk , neutral in coloration , from a second speaker . ( 3 ) New talk , based on the new relationship that is evolving between images and words , from a third speaker . A discussion of the second kind of talk will reveal something about all three : After the Second World War , there came into power at Harvard Univer  --  sity , an old backwater near to the cen  --  ter of national life , a New Man . He was represented as having a point of view , but what he had in fact was a function and a tone of voice . His func  --  tion was to make a new arrangement between the old backwater and national life . His tone of voice was neu  --  tral . This neutral tone of voice was his point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice explained him . His effectiveness depended in some degree , however , on the presence at Harvard of certain old men , with whom he was juxtaposed . In the ab  --  sence of these men , with whom he was in contrast , he looked very much like other strong , neutral men of his gen  --  eration ; that is , he seemed not particu  --  lar but general . He had toughness and integrity . Here were two wirelike threads that linked him to his insti  --  tution and to the old men who were his mentors . One decision he made demonstrated both his toughness and his integrity : he refused to adopt the manners of the old men , which were beguiling . This man , where he continues to serve his institution , now represents the Old Guard of his institution . He is an important figure in that he does understand the ways of his backwater even though he has not adopted them himself . It must be difficult for him , in some cases , to welcome the newer sort of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficially and puts them on and casts them off as he pleases . We may think of continuity within Harvard University as having three strands : toughness ; manners ; spirit . Wound together , they would have one destiny . They are not wound together ; they are separate . After the Second World War , it was decided that toughness would continue into the next generation and manners would not . What of spirit ? It may be that the old men tried to pass on their spiritual inheritance to the new , tough man and failed . It may he that they did not try to pass on their spiritual inheritance . Or it may he , as it seems to me , that their spiritual inheritance had shrunk over time until it was no longer able to compete on equal terms with toughness or man  --  ners . It seems to me likely that by the time of the Second World War the spiritual in  --  heritance of Harvard University was able to do very light work only ; that the work it took on to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ded within manners , so that when it was decided that manners would not continue , spirit ( now known only as a form of energy within manners ) died , too . Not died  --  was not passed on . The spirit would not really die until the last self-confident old man died ; and many self-confident old men lived on , more cheerful than ever . WHAT happened was that the work of running the university was separated from the work of main  --  taining its particular character . This explains the three kinds of talk . We have discussed the neutral tone of the second speaker . Now let us consider the two other kinds of talk . A person attending Harvard after the Second World War might have decided to make a study of the inheri  --  tance of Harvard . In time , he would understand that his study was narrow ; it was not , as he had thought , the study that embraced all the others . From that time , although his syntax would reflect his study of self-confi  --  dence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first speaker . Another person would find in the inheritance a kind of motif to he used to decorate , or to frame , whatever sort of excellence he wanted to promote . This was the third speaker , and also the film . IT will be the purpose of this essay to consider aspects of an inheri  --  tance ; I will try to determine what it was that came to Harvard with the Black Rock Forest . When I described Harvard as " an old backwater near to the center of national life , " I was speaking of a former condition ; Harvard is now a part of national fife , and life there is not distinguishable from life anywhere else . When I used the phrase " old backwater near to the center of na  --  tional life , " there was nothing insult  --  ing in the use of the word " backwa  --  ter ; " I was thinking of the truck gar  --  dens that used to exist quite close to New York City and from which the city constantly drew refreshment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men into this story . My idea is that even the most difficult story ( " Atomic Energy in the Modern World , " " New Frontiers in Micro-Biology , " " Our Colleges in Crisis " ) can be told as the history of the work of particular men and should be told that way . The reader will accept this device . He is used to the idea that men , at their daily tasks , are occupying a cer  --  tain space in the foreground . I want to address the question of the background against which these men appear , and to try to suggest that this background should he understood as the accumu  --  lated result of knowable stories . This is important , because it is im  --  portant to set right a deformation in modern discourse , a twofold mistake : the first part of the mistake is to think of the background against which the work of modern persons is juxtaposed as unknowable ; the second part of the mistake is to accept it  --  whatever it is . Now I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ignore  --  actually ignore  --  the question of the background against which their own lives are juxtaposed is that they imagine that some persons do understand this background ( are in charge of it ) and that these people-in  --  charge are their social betters . I would like to make the point in this regard that the President and Fellows of Har  --  vard College and the college composed of living Harvard men and women do not understand the background against which modern lives are juxtaposed . It is only at fund-raising moments that they remember that they did , once , un  --  derstand it . ASMALL beginning may be to tell the story of the Black Rock Forest in terms of the histories of par ticular men who were connected to it . Then places can be in dicated at which this story may be said to join larger histories : of Harvard University , of the conservation policies of the gov ernment of the United States , of the history of optimistic thought within the conserva tion policies of the government , and of the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physics and biology in this century . FIRST , a father . James Stillman was a banker ; he was thought by some people to be a ruthless one . He was associated with William Rockefeller , the brother of John D. Rockefeller , and operated with Rockefeller and a small group of other men as a capitalist , which is to say that he was interested in the power of money within an enterprise , quite apart from any particular thing the enterprise was set up to do . The Still  --  man-Rockefeller group was described ( by Henry Clews , a contemporary on Wall Street ) as having resources so vast " that they need only concentrate on any given property in order to do with it what they please . " As soon as this was known , they became unbear  --  ably attractive to investors . In the Amalgamated Copper manipulation , it was the reputation ( for ruthlessness and vast resources ) of the Rockefeller-Stillman manipulators that was at-trac  --  tive , more than the reputation of cop  --  per . The formula was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the South Sea Bubble , but the distant place where there was wealth beyond count  --  ing was in the Rockefeller-Stillman circle , as far as most investors were concerned , rather than in Montana . THEN a son . Ernest Stillman , the youngest son of James Stillman , was a medical doctor . His impulse in all his activities seems to have been toward healing . He had an enthusiasm for firefighting , which seeks to remedy a spreading trouble . Also , we should note here that the land that was to constitute the Black Rock Forest was in a deplorable condition at the time Dr. Stillman in  --  herited it from his father : these acres had been cut over for timber to be used ( once reduced to charcoal ) as fuel for the hrickmaking factories along the Hudson . The land was the ruined re  --  mainder of the economic processes em  --  braced and mastered by his father . Er  --  nest Stillman wanted to bring this par  --  ticular tract of land back to health , perhaps . More than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His idea was that this protected forest , at least , should be constantly useful and also constantly flourishing . NOW I need to consider Gifford Pinchot , whose ideal the con  --  stantly useful , constantly flourishing forest was ( he said that one of his THE NEW YORKER goals for a forest was " sustained yield , " and that the ideal against which conservation policies ought to be tested was " the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time " ) , but first I want to mention one other man : Richard Thornton Fisher , of Harvard . Fisher was for many years ( in the first half of this century ) the head of the Harvard Forest , in Peter  --  sham , Massachusetts  --  a demonstra  --  tion forest acquired in 1907 . It was he who suggested to Dr. Ernest Stillman that the land he owned in the Hudson Highlands might be set up as a second demonstration forest . Richard Fisher seems to have acted in a fatherly way toward Dr. Stillman . Dr. Stillman 's son Calvin Stillman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934 , was the greatest blow Ernest Stillman suffered in his life . At Richard Fisher 's death , a committee of Harvard alumni published a small book in his honor . The hook was printed at the Cornwall Press , which was owned by Dr. Ernest Stillman . The book included this bio graphical note : Richard T. Fisher entered Harvard with the Class of 1898 , and in due time received his A.B . degree . He was an editor of the Advocate and a member of the O.K. Society and Hasty Pudding club . He spe  --  cialized in courses in the English Depart  --  ment and graduated with honorable men  --  tion in English composition . Those of us who knew him as an undergraduate as  --  sumed that he was likely to devote himself to English studies and teaching . As a mat  --  ter of fact , during the first winter after he graduated , he did serve the College as an assistant in Professor Wendell 's and Pro  --  fessor Copeland 's courses . But meanwhile an accidental combination of events deter  --  mined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a small party that C. Hart Mer  --  riam , then at the head of the U.S. Biologi  --  cal Survey , took out for a season of collect  --  ing on the upper slopes of Mount Shasta , and the experience with Merriam , more than any ordinary course in zoology , awoke in him a realization that what he most desired was some occupation that had to do with nature . Coincidentally , while on Mount Shasta , Fisher encountered Gif  --  ford Pinchot , who had just become Chief of the Division of Forestry ( later devel  --  oped into the United States Forest Ser  --  vice ) , and Mr. Pinchot offered him field work for the ensuing summer , Thereafter Fisher continued either in the Forest Ser  --  vice or on leave of absence as a student in the Yale Forest School , until he was ap  --  pointed Instructor at Harvard . Before he began to teach he had thus been one of the enthusiastic and " closely knit group of men who helped Mr. Pinchot get the prac  --  tice of forestry under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men who discovered the life that money might have as money , JUNE 11,1984 apart from any particular work in the world  --  apart , even , from " rates of in  --  terest " and the ordinary terminology of the hanker . He was one of a small number of men who saw that money might be free ; that it might have a life of its own . ERNEST STILLMAN , his youngest son , was drawn to healing work ; he took particular interest in a particular tract of ravaged land , which he hoped to bring to health in such a way that it would stay useful and healthy for the longest time he could foresee . RICHARD FISHER acted in a fatherly way to Ernest Stillman , and was em  --  braced , perhaps , as a father by him . Richard Fisher had been , in his youth , " one of the enthusiastic and ' closely knit group of men who helped Mr. I Gifford Pinchot get the practice of forestry under way . ' " GIFFORD P1NCH0T was born on Au @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  necticut . His father had made a for  --  tune in drygoods in New York City . His maternal grandfather , Amos Eno , was a successful investor in real estate and was the owner of the Fifth Ave  --  nue Hotel . Pinchot went to Exeter and Yale . Just before he enrolled at Yale , his father suggested to him that he make forestry his career . This was a most interesting intuition , since there was no forestry school at Yale , or anywhere in the country , at that mo  --  ment . Pinchot wrote in his autobiog  --  raphy : So I took a course in meteorology , which has to do with weather and climate . And another in botany , which has to do with the vegetable kingdom  --  trees are unques  --  tionably vegetable . And another in geol  --  ogy , for forests grow out of the earth . Also I took a course in astronomy , for it is the sun which makes trees grow . He left America for Europe . When he returned , in 1890 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in America , the condition of the forests was very striking : vast for  --  ests had been thoroughly lumbered over and had been left in pitiable con  --  dition . Pinchot felt he had a role to play . His first work was for great mag  --  nates , however : he worked for W. Sew  --  ard Webb in the Adirondacks and for Webb 's connection George Washing  --  ton Vanderbilt near Asheville , North Carolina . THE Vanderbilt family in Amer  --  ica may he discussed in terms of the history of railroading , the his  --  tory of social life , the history of architecture . In the history of architec  --  ture , they are secure in their place as promoters of gorgeous European styles . The family possessed almost a dozen large houses on Fifth Avenue in New York , the most remarkable of which was the " ch  --  teau " of Cornelius Vanderbilt III , at Fifty-seventh Street . Among their country houses were the house of Frederick Vanderbilt in Hyde Park , New York ; the Breakers and Marble House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house of Hamilton Twomhly and Florence Vanderbilt Tvvotnbly ; and Biltmore , near Ashe  --  ville , North Carolina , the house of George Washington Vanderbilt . This last house has been known since the time of its building as " the largest private house in America . " It was modelled on the ch  --  teau of Blois , but the work is not so finely done as it is at Blois . The interior is furnished with old European pieces and with imitations of such pieces . The house , which if it were in Europe would be beneath anyone 's notice , is heavily vis  --  ited by the public . The house is viewed by the public , I think , as a symbol of success , and it is that . It is representa  --  tive of the failure of success to take hold in America . Some moment of success left this thing . People look at it , but they do n't understand it . Biltmore has shrunk . There was a forest ; an arboretum was envisioned . What remains is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in developing an arbo  --  retum at Biltmore . Gifford Pinchot ( working as the " consulting forester " at Biltmore ) wrote this enthusiastic prospectus , in 1893 : It is the intention to make this Arbore  --  tum one of the finest in existence . There are already in the Nursery more kinds of trees and shrubs than there are in the Botanical Gardens at Kew , near Landon , and the number is being steadily increased . The climate will allow a larger variety of trees than that of any other large arbore  --  tum which has so far been begun , while the liberal plan of the work is intended to make the best use of so admirable an op  --  portunity . A careful record of the treat  --  ment of each species is being , and will be , kept ; while a Forest Botanical Library , already of considerable extent , will furnish the necessary aid to study . We may , for purposes of this essay , establish the arboretum as a symbol for one kind of activity undertaken in America with reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see that the arboretum takes notice of the well-established gardens at Kew and means to outdo them  --  not as a result of an urgent interest in outdoing them but in consequence of certain natural advantages ( here meteorologi  --  cal ) to be found on this new continent . Biltmore House , on the other hand , has been built in an atmosphere of urgent need , and no natural advan  --  tages exist in North Carolina to sup  --  port it . A third symbol is to he found in Biltmore Forest . The forest was that extensive portion of the Biltmore property given over to scientific forest management . It was described by Gif  --  ford Pinchot as follows : It is composed in greater part of Oaks and other deciduous trees , chiefly in the younger stages of their growth , with Pines scattered among the broad-leaved trees , and here and there pure patches of them in the old fields . The forest , Pinchot said , " derives an additional interest from the fact that it is the first piece of woodland in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , the prime object of which is to pay the owner while improving the forest . " Of the condition of the forest at the time the " regular system of manage  --  ment " was instituted , Pinchot said , Previous to the time of purchase by Mr. George W. Vanderbilt , the area now in  --  cluded in Biltmore Estate was held by a number of small farmers . These people , poor as the mountain farmer is apt to be , were obliged to use without reserve all the resources of their scantily productive lands . They were therefore in the habit of cutting all trees which could be used or sold as fuel , fencing , or saw-logs . They turned their cattle into the forest , and often burned over their woodlands . for the sake of the pasturage .... Under such treatment the forest , originally of moder  --  ate quality , grew steadily worse . The more valuable species of trees were removed , and the less valuable ones remained to seed the ground and perpetuate their kind .... At the time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condi  --  tion of a large part of the forest was deplorable in the extreme . Pinchot did not stay long at Biltmore . In 1898 , he went to work for the United States Department of Agriculture as the head of its Forestry Division . There he was called the Chief Forester ; he was the first man to hold this version of the title , and it appealed to him , as he was the first American-horn man to be a profes  --  sional forester . Pinchot 's idea of what forestry might be can be thought of as having three parts . There was a scientific component , encompassing the study of the various factors that affect the growth and thrift of trees ; a practical component , taking into consideration what goal was looked for in the cul  --  ture and harvest of trees ; and a conser  --  vative component , which sought to balance questions of usefulness in the short term and usefulness in the longer term . These three parts were not arcs of a circle but cups that fitted one inside another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific study and practical use were meant to fit . There were objections to this point of view . To many men , Pinchot 's ar  --  rangement seemed to use one cup too many . A simpler plan was to remove the scientific and the practical from the conservative-ethical context  --  to free them . We should take note of the opinions of two men who were at work in forestry at this time : Bernhard E. Fernow , who was Pinchot 's predeces  --  sor at the Department of Agriculture ; and Dr. Carl Alwin Schenck , a Ger  --  man forester , who succeeded Pinchot at Biltmore and was head of the Biltmore Forest School there . methods of forestry which to assure a " sustained yield " long period , Fernow wrote in If then in a country Germany with dense population , where in many places every twig can be marketed , with settled conditions of market , with no virgin woods which could be cheaply exploited and come into advantageous competition with the costlier material produced by managed properties , with cost of labor low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der such conditions the returns for the expenditure of money , skill , intellect in the production of wood crops are not more promising returning from three to four per cent on invested capital , it would seem hopeless to develop the argument of profitableness in a country where all these conditions are the reverse , and a business  --  man considers a six per cent return on investment no sufficient inducement . Of the Biltmore Forest School ( which had been established in 1898 by Dr. Schenck and existed in one form or another until 1913 ) , Dr. Schenck wrote , " I thought of it as a practical and technical school , the teachings of which , notably in lumber  --  ing and in financing , would be capable of immediate application in American woods . " We see that for Fernow and Schenck ( as for later generations of lumbermen and graduates of forestry schools ) the issue of forest manage  --  ment was not symbolic of some larg  --  er American issue . For Pinchot , it was . It is also true that his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Schenck , for instance ) , was on the distant future . In America , the man who is reputed to be forward-looking wants only to see into the moment that is just beyond his grasp . The far distance has no interest for him . It may be the backward-looking man who thinks most clearly about the future . Pinchot wrote , in his book " The Fight for Conservation , " in 1910 : Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the American people is their superb practical optimism ; that marvellous hope  --  fulness which keeps the individual effi  --  sufficiently at work . This hopefulness of the American is , however , as short-sighted as it is intense . As a rule , it does not look ahead beyond the next decade or score of years , and fails wholly to reckon with the real future of the Nation . I do not think I have often heard a forecast of the growth of our population that extended beyond a total of two hundred millions , and that only as a distant and shadowy goal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor far-sighted . We shall reach a population of two hundred mil  --  lions in the very near future , as time is counted in the lives of nations . An enthusiastic man himself , he concerned himself with the question of what enthusiasm might do , and denied that it must inevitably apply itself to the stale job of increasing the momen  --  tum of whatever forces were already at work . He imagined , I think , that he had found an instant in time in which American enthusiasm might he redi  --  rected . His understanding of his coun  --  try was unusual , and he was justified , perhaps , in thinking that he might shape it . He wrote : No man may rightly fail to take a great pride in what has been accomplished by means of the destruction of our natural resources so far as it has gone . It is a paradoxical statement , perhaps , but never  --  theless true , because out of this attack on what nature has given we have won a kind of prosperity and a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . For example , nothing like the rapidity of the destruction of American forests has ever been known in forest history , and nothing like the efficiency and vigor and inventiveness of the American lumberman has ever been developed by any attack on any forests elsewhere . Probably the most effective tool that the human mind and hand have ever made is the American axe . So the American business man has grasped his opportunities and used them and devel  --  oped them arid invented about them , thought them into lines of success , and thus has developed into a new business man , with a vigor and effectiveness and a cutting-edge that have never been equalled anywhere else . We have gained out of the vast destruction of our natural resources a degree of vigor and power and efficiency of which every man of us ought to be proud . Now that is done . We have accom  --  plished these big things . What is the next step ? Shall we go on in the same lines to the certain destruction of the prosperity which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all human history , turn our backs on the uncivilized point of view , and adopt toward our natural re  --  sources the average prudence and average foresight and average care that we long ago adopted as a rule of our daily life ? This is an unusual and interesting set of remarks . " We have gained out of the vast destruction of our natural resources a degree of vigor and power and efficiency of which every man of us ought to be proud . " This is an unusual statement . An image comes to life here : a man on a piece of land . The land is damaged ; the man has damaged it . But look : the man is pow  --  erful , strong , and happy . We recall that Frederick Law Olmsted saw a murderer ( a man responsible for the death of many people ) perform an act of high courage . This is what Ameri  --  can history is like , but it is hard for us to accept : that a vigorous and splendid country could have been built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American enthusiasm de  --  scribe only the nourishing power of enthusiasm , its ability to transform experience . Our attention is drawn , again and again , to the vigorous con  --  dition of the man with the axe . People who think that American enthusiasm ought to be curbed ignore this strong man and look only at the damage he has caused . Pinchot is one of a small number of powerful American men ( Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt are others ) who allow them  --  selves to see both the glory of the vigorous man and the damage he has done . Pinchot takes note of the won  --  derful force that has been used to do the damage and asks that it be al  --  lowed to continue  --  but doing different work . Men like Pinchot must ordinarily fail . Many Americans feel that it is in the contemplation of the possibility of uncontrolled recklessness that the nourishing power of enthusiasm actu  --  ally resides ; many other people have cultivated an interest in damage , and even in inventories of damaged things . Enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rarely put forward as a practical policy . But there were certain circumstances working in Pin  --  chot 's favor at the turn of the century . The forests of the country had been lumbered in such a reckless way that the result was obvious to the public . The near-total destruction of the pre-Colonial forest was as striking to people as the final depletion of Ameri  --  can oil reserves will be . Moreover , Pinchot found that he had the ear of Theodore Roosevelt , who was unex  --  pectedly elevated to the Presidency by the assassination of William McKin  --  ley in 1901 . IN 1926 , Richard Thornton Fisher , the director of the Harvard Forest , in Petersham , Massachusetts , walked over a tract of land in Cornwall , New York , owned by his friend Dr. Ernest Stillman . Like the land that had been formed into the Biltmore Estate , this was damaged land that had been pur  --  chased from many smallholders by a rich man  --  in this case , Dr. Stillman 's father , the banker James Stillman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demonstration forest . It was so established , and was called the Black Rock Forest ; the name derived from Black Rock Moun  --  tain , one of a number of high hills within the tract . A system of publica  --  tions ( Bulletins and Papers ) describing the work being done within the forest was established as well . Richard Fisher contributed an in  --  troduction to the first Black Rock For  --  est Bulletin , in 1930 . He wrote : The Black Rock Forest , from which this bulletin is the first publication , is probably the first institution of its kind to be estab  --  lished in the United States  --  a private property organized as a forest laboratory for research in problems of forest manage  --  ment and for the demonstration of success  --  ful methods in practice . In carrying out this purpose , for which a great deal of the preliminary work is already done , the For  --  est has every prospect of rendering a valu  --  able public service . The tract is of ample size , and by reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe from fire , Adequate financing and expert supervision assure it of efficient manage  --  ment Moreover , the Black Rock Forest represents a region where the problem of the future use of land is of peculiar eco  --  nomic and social importance , and where but little systematic work has been done to solve it . In the hills of northern New jersey and the Highlands of the Hudson , almost at the back doors of the greatest center of popu  --  lation in the country , there is in the aggre  --  gate a very large area of rough , wooded land , much of it still practically a wilder  --  ness . For generations it has been repeat  --  edly cut over for wood and many times ravaged by fire . As a result many of the better species of trees have become scarce , inferior kinds have increased growth and reproductive capacity is enfeebled. and the soil is impoverished . For most of this type of land  --  rocky , steep , and thin-soiled  --  the only foreseeable use is for recreation or forest products . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rejuvenated in growth and value and the soil restored as far as possible to its maxi  --  mum fertility . To this end it is necessary that the right methods be worked out to eliminate the worthless and to increase the growth and reproduction of the better spe  --  cies , to restore the fertility of the soil , and in time to define the types of vegetation that will make the best use of these rough and stony sites . It is the program of the Black Rock Forest to supply this needed knowledge , not only by publishing periodically the re  --  sults of experimental work , but by display  --  ing to visitors the various areas or plots in the woods where different kinds of treat  --  ment have been applied and how they have succeeded . Looking to the future relation between the metropolitan area and its nearest available region of wild land , this will be a service of the greatest value . When Richard Fisher wrote the in  --  troduction to the first Bulletin , he was fifty-four . Thirty-seven years had passed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under  --  taken within Biltmore Forest . Thirty two years had passed since Fisher en  --  countered Gifford Pinchot on Mount Shasta . WE might return for a moment to Pinchot 's description of the work he was doing ( and planned to do ) at Biltmore . This description is contained in a booklet entitled " Bilt  --  more Forest , " which was written in connection with an exhibit taken by the Biltmore Estate to the Columbian Exposition of 1893 . The following quotation is from " Planting , " a sec  --  tion in which Pinchot laid out his plans for planting trees in certain patches of wasteland at Biltmore : The plan upon which the forest planting is to be undertaken is a wide one and is likely to produce important results . We are acquainted with a great number of exotic species in their garden character : we know very few of them as to their adaptation to Forest uses . Of the silvicuftural character of American trees we are almost equally ignorant . It is intended , therefore , to plant blocks of an acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American and foreign trees , assigning each to the character of land which it is most likely to occupy with advantage .... Such an experiment may be expected , in the course of time , to add many important species to the useful forest flora of the country . This quotation introduces the idea of planting trees , which Pinchot did not in general favor ; he preferred to concern himself with natural repro  --  duction within the forest . And it con  --  tains the interesting remark " Of the silvicultural character of American trees we are almost equally ignorant . " This is a true statement to this day , and it is clear why : it is hard to get to know the silvicultural character of trees ( there are countless elements that affect the growth of trees in situ over their long life ) , and , given the way we prefer to live in America , there is no very good reason for trying . The situ  --  ation might he compared with one in which people neglect to pay attention to the specific things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very complex and hard to pin down , because mastery of these things promises success only in one particular place , and because peo  --  ple have become habituated to towns of standardized manufacture . We know about trees what we think we need to know , and what is exciting to know . That is , we know what men at work in basic science tell us is true for very many trees or all trees ; we know from experience which species , growing under what conditions , harvested in which way , fit best into the framework of our economic life as it exists now . Nearly all else is still hidden . We might return again to the sym  --  bols within the Biltmore Estate . Mit  --  more House represents an attempt to establish a place within national life . It is everywhere and nowhere . It has little to do with North Carolina . The arboretum has roots in the specific conditions to be found near Asheville , North Carolina , but with reference to other arboretums , elsewhere . Within the forest there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time , be found to be useful in other places , but first of all it is what it is : a forest in North Caro  --  lina , tending to good health or poor . Everywhere and nowhere is the way of national life and is also the place where basic scientific research is to be found . It may be of interest to some few persons that the first work was done in this or that place , but the success of the work is in proportion to the degree to which the work is dif  --  fused throughout the world . //ere and there is the manner of the museum , where the location of the collection is only part of the issue . Mostly here is the way of silvicul  --  ture , and also of human settlements , which must necessarily be affected by specific local conditions . In recent times , the first two ways of being in a place have been much more important to the American people than the third  --  this despite the fact that everyone does live in some particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how this or that particular place might be brought into a healthy condi  --  tion . I 199-0 , Dr. Ernest Stillman wrote 1 a letter to Dr. James B. Conant , the president of Harvard University , and enclosed a memorandum he had written on the subject of the Harvard Forest and the Black Rock Forest . Dr. Stillman urged Harvard to give a greater attention to the Harvard For  --  est , which he felt was being neglected . He also urged Harvard to agree to accept the Black Rock Forest at his death . I do not know exactly what position Harvard was taking at this time about the Harvard Forest ( of which Dr. Stillman was the principal benefactor ) and the Black Rock Forest ( of which Dr. Stillman was the sole proprietor ) ; the relevant documents are protected by a " fifty-year rule " ? under which documents are withheld from public scrutiny for fifty years . The university seems to have been re  --  luctant to commit itself to taking on the Black Rock Forest . " As long as the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be  --  coming a part of the forestry plant of the University , naturally I erroneously assumed that the necessary arrange  --  ments had been made , " Dr. Stillman wrote in 1940 in his letter to Conant . Apparently , the necessary arrange  --  ments had not been made . In the memorandum that accompa  --  nied his letter to President Conant , Dr. Stillman discussed several plans ( to be financed in large part by Dr. Stillman himself ) that he felt would bring the Harvard Forest into great  --  er prominence . He referred to the Harvard Forest as " a barely explored academic gold mine . " He advanced the opinion that a set of forest models , financed by him , would interest not only distinguished visitors but also the general public . He wrote that " the members of the biological staffs have not made use of the forest 's re  --  sources because of lack of proper hous  --  ing facilities . " To that sentence Pro  --  fessor Hugh Raup , of the Arnold Ar  --  boretum , at Harvard , appended this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the biological staff at Harvard is uninterested as yet in the things they can find at Peter  --  sham . It is hard to control experiments outside of the laboratory ; hence , the dyed-in-the-wool laboratory man is often afraid to work in the open field . " Raup 's em  --  phasis . Of the Black Rock Forest property Dr. Stillman wrote : The Black Rock Forest in its 12 years of life has already produced so Much valuable scientific knowledge that it seemed a shame to have these experiments terminate at my death . Three alternatives presented themselves : ( 1 ) establish an individual foundation ; ( 2 ) deed the property to the Bronx Botanical Park , Syracuse or Cornell Universities ; or ( 3 ) deed the property to Harvard University . I discarded the first , as the management would be too narrow . I naturally favored the last , as I believe the Black Rock Forest would be complementary to the Harvard Forest . In order that the Forest would not be a burden on the University , I arranged to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defray the expenses of operating both the Black Rock Forest and the Harvard Forest . If the corporation decides not to accept the Black Rock For ? est with its endowment , I must make other arrangements . HARVARD accepted the gift . I imag  --  ine this conversation : FELLOW OF HARVARD : And then there is the question of the Black Rock Forest . PRESIDENT OF HARVARD : Not again ! FELLOW : I think we ought to accept it , you know . PRESIDENT : Why ? We already have a forest and I 'm not aware we need another . FELLOW : One must distinguish be  --  tween spinsters . The Forest we have and will continue to have ( for no one will allow us to part from her ) is poor ; at best , she just gets by , and ( there is no end to our bad luck ) her most faithful friend has been the gentleman who wants to give us Forest No. 2 . PRESIDENT : No one knows what we suffer from the generosity of our grad  --  uates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who suffer in silence . PRESIDENT : I approve of silence . FELLOW : The temple . PRESIDENT : The grave . And Forest No. 2 is ... FELLOW : Rich . PRESIDENT : And unselfish ! I know this old maid . She does not spend money on herself ! Brave in adversity , she shrinks from her own large in  --  come ; it 's the one thing she dreads . Dividends and interest are anathema to her , and yet she must spend , lest her enormous capital grow more gro  --  tesquely huge , producing an income even more unwieldy . Without a poor relation on whom to lavish care she is ? ... lost ! A nightmare dilemma . I see our duty now . FELLOW : Once again , you have pierced to the heart of the matter . And who knows ? In time .. . PRESIDENT : She may wander off . What 's the name ? FELLOW : Black Rock Forest . PRESIDENT : Or find a beau who does n't like dowries . FELLOW : That man is rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE FOREST SOON after the Harvard fund-rais  --  ing event at the United States Military Academy , I went to see Mr. Esty Stowell . Mr. Stowell is a gradu  --  ate of Harvard College , Class of 1934 . He maintains a house in Cornwall , New York , near the Black Rock For ? est . He said , " We have known for some time that Harvard had lost inter  --  est in the forest . John Stillman , a son of Dr. Stillman 's , who lives here , wrote to Harvard sometime in the nineteen-fifties , and someone there wrote hack saying , Oh , we are doing this and that . But nothing has really gone on in the forest for years and years  --  although Harvard does keep the roads up . In any case , after the Storm King issue came up  --  in the early nineteen-sixties , if you remem  --  ber , Con Edison wanted to build a pumped-storage plant here  --  Harvard appointed a committee to see what its response should be to Con Edison 's proposal , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some  --  where in the report of that committee , it says that Harvard should think about getting rid of the forest , because no real work was being done in it . Rather like the railroads , you see . It runs down , and then people say , ' Im  --  possible to go on , it 's so run down . ' In any case , some few of us went on the alert after that . Over the whole period , Harvard has been very elusive . There was a period in the middle seventies when it pursued a deal with the Pali  --  sades Interstate Park Commission , but the Park Commission was not able after all to get the funds it would have needed to buy the forest , so that fell through . And then , you see , we began to worry that Harvard , having be  --  gun this process , might consider any buyer , and a few of us began to ask , and ask again , what Harvard 's inten  --  tions were . I began a correspondence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what I got back in most instances was a total mouthful of feathers . ' No decision has been reached ; we 're not talking to anyone at this moment . ' It was ' Harvard will do the right thing ' kind of talk . He wo n't say much except that Harvard feels secure in its legal position , because Dr. Stillman did not put any language in his will saying that the forest must revert to his heirs if Harvard did n't follow a given course of action . That 's what makes John Stillman so angry : he says  --  quite rightly , I think  --  that of course his father did n't use that language , because he trusted Harvard . Besides , you know , I think Harvard does n't like accepting gifts with that kind of restriction , and it probably asked him to make the bequest as sim  --  ple as possible , but that 's a guess . " There are so many issues here . First of all , the forest is very interest  --  ing , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : wood-lot management and so forth  --  just the sort of thing people are interested in now . Would n't you think Harvard would think about that ? Well , it does n't . And , of course , the forest is beautiful . My wife and I walk in it all the time ; the roads and trails are mar  --  vellous . We have been just about ev  --  erywhere , I would say , except down to Glycerine Hollow . It 's all terribly well done . I mean , it has been laid out with care , and , of course , there are experi  --  mental plots all through it , testing whether this sort of tree grows best here or there . I wish I could tell you more about that , but I ca n't . You would have liked Henry Tryon , who was the forester here . He was what I call a rough diamond . Always wore red suspenders . His attitude toward the forest was almost the attitude of a poet . There was a sign that Hal Tryon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square , I would say . And on it  --  very neat  --  was a description of a cycle in silviculture . And it concluded with this : The trees were cut ; their work was done . ' There was an ama  --  teur poet shining through . He had that spirit  --  an amateur , in the old sense . He was a big , burly , red-haired Harvard guy . Ex-football player . " I would say the important issue is : Harvard gave its word . " You must walk around the forest . It 's laid out so well ; you can take short walks or quite long ones . We 'll go on a short one today . On another day , I suggest you make a circuit . I will give you a map . You might go south as far as Spy Rock and Eagle Cliff . That 's a good day 's walk . " And go and talk to Steiner . We ca n't get much out of him . Just that Harvard feels secure in its legal posi  --  tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Rock Forest today , start  --  ing from the entrance to the forest , at the Upper Reservoir , he might climb the Hill of Pines to the top , where there is a fine view all around . He might look at pitch pine and scrub oak ( Henry Tryon assumed that they con  --  stituted one of the few scraps of the pre-Colonial pattern remaining within the Forest ) , then descend to Carpenter Road ( an ample , well-maintained dirt road ) , head west on Carpenter Road , then southwest on Bog Meadow Road to the white-blazed trail called the Scenic Trail , then walk on the Scenic Trail to Eagle Cliff , elevation 1,443 feet . This is about as far south as a THE NEW YORKER person can go in the forest . From this spot , there is a wonderful view south in the direction of New York City . It is the sort of view that no one thinks can exist dose to New York City  --  the sort of thing that a person heads west for . From here , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Scenic Trail again until the turnoff to the Chatfield Trail ; the Chatfield Trail to Chatfield Road ; east on Chat  --  field Road to the White Oak Trail , passing the Tamarack Pond and the Chatfield farmhouse ( a splendid stone building of 1834 ) , and passing a tract reforested in red pine by Henry Tryon ; west on the White Oak Trail to Sutherland Road ; northeast on Sutherland Road to the Schunemunk  --  Storm King Trail ; up Black Rock , elevation 1,410 ; down to the Aleck Meadow Reservoir and White Oak Road . This would take most of one day . On another day , a person might go to Glycerine Hollow . This would be a short trip : south from the entrance to the forest to Carpenter Road by the Hill of Pines Trail and then to Go-Down Road . No route could be finer than Go-Down Road . It is broader than a trail but narrower now titan a road . It is a road gone gentle . It is grassy most of its length and descends at a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes straight to where it is going . This is what Henry Tryon said in 1939 in his Ten Year Progress Report about Glycerine Hollow and his work there : Nine and one-half acres of mixed hard  --  wood association , about seventy years old , were marked for cleaning in the autumn of 1928 . Our original plan was to follow this operation with two , or perhaps more , im  --  provement cuttings with the object of en  --  couraging reproduction of the better com  --  mercial species . The original stand was ( and still is ) about the best timber in the Forest , Form and height are unusually good , But advance growth was hard to find . Our cleaning operation , which removed the dead , dying , overtopped and deformed stems , with an occasional intermediate or codominant. tallied , to our great surprise , 16.8 cords per acre . The appearance of the area was at first unusually clean and neat , but the inevitable sprout growth soon al  --  tered this . Here as in Cutting Id , nothing appeared at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young white ash , red oak , sugar maple , and yellow poplar was showing . The density of this new growth made us wonder if our projected additional cuttings would be needed . By 1936 the reproduc  --  tion of these species was so numerous that we abandoned entirely our idea of extra cuttings and decided to leave matters tem  --  porarily as they were . This stand can be left to grow for at least fifty years longer . It is a crop of medium-sized , valuable sawlogs now , with easy accessibility . The additional volume increment will raise the money return from the final cutting ; the overwood ap  --  pears to be in excellent health , with no danger of decadence for a long period , and the reproduction is becoming well estab  --  lished . A final cutting could be made to  --  morrow ; but we see no merit in that . We believe the best plan will be to delay har  --  vesting this area until a strongly favorable market becomes available . It is interesting to note that the thinning applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ume basis , did not admit sufficient light to stimulate water-sprouting to any marked extent . Here , too , future investigation may re  --  veal that our " tinkering " with the species association of this particular site has caused an upset . Conversely , we may per  --  haps find that our slight rearrangement of the composition ( for here we expect to increase but slightly the percentage of white ash and yellow poplar ) is precisely what nature has been seeking to accom  --  plish . In contrast with Cutting 1a , the anticipated composition will not differ as sharply from the old mixture . Cutting 2a is another test plot in our search to deter  --  mine what species mixture will give the highest yield on this particular site . We may learn that we are wide of the mark or perhaps we shall be agreeably surprised . Much important information is im  --  plicit in these paragraphs . Notice all the room for judgment : not now , later ; this much , no more . Notice the room for the adjustment of judgment : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment of the possibility of grace : we may he in for a pleasant surprise . Notice these recorded facts : ( 1 ) The forest is not a magnificent stand of virgin timber . It is a magnifi  --  cent place , with a history of abuse . In the whole of the forest , Glycerine Hollow has the best stand of timber , and in 1928 that was merely seventy years old . ( 2 ) The timber is meant to be har  --  vested in the end , as part of the natural rhythm of the work of men . There is a trust in the possibilities of work . A man who had come to distrust the work of men might have said , " See here , this is good . Let 's at least keep our hands off this . " A devilish man who had come to despise the work of men might have said , " This is good . What of it ? " Tryon 's opinion is one never heard in our day : " This is good . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1898 , James Wilson , Secre  --  tary of Agriculture to President McKinley , appointed Gifford Pinchot THE NEW YORKER to be Chief Forester of the United States in the Department of Agricul  --  ture . Here Pinchot had a tiny staff , and no forests to manage , because the forest reserves superintended by the federal government were under the ju  --  risdiction of the Secretary of the Inte  --  rior . In the absence of federal land to look into , Pinchot turned to questions relating to the management of private land . On October 15 , 1898 , his divi  --  sion issued Circular 21 , which an  --  nounced a management-assistance program for large tracts of timberland and small woodlots . Small owners could apply for free assistance ; large holders of land were expected to share the cost . Numbers of landholders , small and large , sought help . The ex  --  pansion of his work load justified the expansion of his operation , and in 1899 Pinchot reported , " The Division has been thoroughly equipped with in  --  struments for field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the year , " It was also drawing to it the services of enthusiastic men , many of them recent college graduates , who worked for little money and came to be known as " Pinchot 's young men . " And the liveliness of this operation , in turn , generated more work , and inqui  --  ries from the Department of the Inte  --  rior . Then Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States . While he was governor of New York State , he had consulted with Pinchot . " Like other men who had thought about the national future at all , I had been growing more and more concerned over the destruction of the forests , " Roosevelt wrote in his " Autobiogra  --  phy . " When Roosevelt came to Wash  --  ington after the assassination of Presi  --  dent McKinley , he did not go immedi  --  ately to the White House but stopped at the house of a sister . Gifford Pinchot and his colleague Frederick H. Newell came to call on him there . " The first work I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rec  --  lamation , " Roosevelt wrote . It might be well to describe here Roosevelt 's attitude toward conserva  --  tion . It was influenced by Pinchot , but it was in keeping with other beliefs of his . Proper use might describe it . His faith in himself was abundant , and also his faith in the idea of individual persons making judgments . He was apt to endorse Pinehot 's idea of silvicul  --  ture , since he took the view that the nation itself was like a forest , in which good thrift and healthy reproduction could be encouraged . A striking and , JUNE I I , 1984 to modern minds , an extreme instance of his belief in distinction-making is to be found in his attitude toward large business combinations . He wrote : Where a company is found seeking its profits through serving the community by stimulating production , lowering prices or improving service , while scrupulously re  --  specting the rights of others ( including its rivals , its employees , its customers , and the general public ) , and strictly obeying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how great the volume of its business , it would be encouraged to still more abun  --  dant production . As we discuss the inheritance pres  --  ent within the Black Rock Forest , in Cornwall , New York , this quality of optimism should be remembered , and distinguished from the idea , now com  --  ing to prevail in America , that imper  --  sonal forces rule the world , and that clever men ally themselves with these forces , while idealistic men struggle to move certain valued things out of their way . In 1905 , the forest lands managed by the Interior Department were transferred to the Department of Ag  --  riculture , where Gifford Pinchot was Chief Forester . In 1907 , more than forty-three million acres of land were added by Presidential proclamation to the area of the National Forests . " By this time , also , " Roosevelt wrote in his " Autobiography , " " the opposition of the servants of the special interests in Congress to the Forest Service had become strongly developed , and more time appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of the appropriation hills than on all other Government Bureaus put to  --  gether . Every year the Forest Service had to fight for its life . " He continued : One incident in these attacks is worth recording . While the Agricultural Appro  --  priation Bill was passing through the Sen  --  ate , in 1907 , Senator Fulton , of Oregon , secured an amendment providing that the President could not set aside any addi  --  tional National Forests in the six North  --  western States . This meant retaining some sixteen million of acres to be exploited by land grabbers and by the representatives of the great special interests , at the expense of the public interest . But for four years the Forest Service had been gathering field notes as to what forests ought to be set aside in these States , and so was prepared to act . It was equally undesirable to veto the whole agricultural bill , and to sign it with this amendment effective . Accord  --  ingly , a plan to create the necessary Na  --  tional Forest in these States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid before me by Mr. Pinchot . I approved it . The necessary papers were immediately prepared . I signed the last proclamation a couple of days before , by THE NEW YORKER my signature , the bill became law ; and when the friends of the special interests in the Senate got their amendment through and woke up , they discovered that sixteen million acres of timberland had been saved for the people by putting them in the National Forests before the land grabbers could get at them . The opponents of the Forest Service turned handsprings in their wrath ; and dire were their threats against the Executive ; but the threats could not be carried out , and were really only a tribute to the efficiency of our action . The ethic of restraint put forward by Pinchot and Roosevelt proved to be too small a vessel to hold the enthusi  --  astic ambition of many independent men , who called it " Pinchotism . " Nonetheless , during Theodore Roo  --  sevelt 's Administration the area of the National Forests increased from forty-three million acres to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time in office , Pinchot and Roosevelt had be  --  gun to think of conservation as a worldwide movement . A North Amer  --  ican Conservation Conference was held at the White House on Feb  --  ruary 18 , 1909 . " It is evident that natural resources are not limited by the boundary lines which separate na  --  tions , " Roosevelt wrote in his invita  --  tion ( delivered in person by Gifford Pinchot ) to the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of Mexico . The North American Conservation Conference met for five days and , in its communique to Roosevelt , suggested that " all nations should be invited to join together in conference on the sub  --  ject of world resources , and their in  --  ventory , conservation , and wise utili  --  zation . " Soon afterward , Roosevelt left office . The worldwide conserva  --  tion conference envisioned by Pinchot and Roosevelt did not take place . Pinchot was removed from office by Roosevelt 's successor , William How  --  ard Taft  --  a fact that Roosevelt noted bitterly in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom the nation owes most for what has been accomplished as regards the pres  --  ervation of the natural resources of our country , " he wrote . " I believe it is but just to say that among the many , many public officials who under my adminis  --  tration rendered literally invaluable service to the people of the United States , he , on the whole , stood first . " In looking again at the phrase " what has been accomplished as re  --  gards the preservation of the natural resources of our country , " we must admit that while Pinchot had suc  --  ceeded in bringing a vast amount of JUNE II , 1984 land under public stewardship he had not succeeded in bringing his idea of conservation into a synthesis with the national enthusiasm for work . Pinchot has described a moment early in a December , 1908 , governors ' meeting when he began to understand what President-elect Taft 's position would be : The first words Taft spoke after I called the meeting to order and introduced him as its presiding officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , Ladies and Gentlemen : There is one difficulty about the conserva  --  tion of natural resources . It is that the imagination of those who are pressing it may outrun the practical facts .

With love to you all , I am Your affectionate son , JAMES S. Robert W. Sayles , assistant in charge of the geological collection at the Museum of Comparative Zoology , in Cambridge , to Jerome D. Greene , Secretary to the Corporation , Harvard University : MY DEAR MR . GREENE : A little while ago Mr. Ernest G. Still  --  man , the son of James Stillman , gave me a collection of Japanese lantern slides , the pictures of which he took himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Geology and Geography . They are now in the Gardner Collection , but the gift is to the Department of Geology and Geog  --  raphy . Mr. Stillman 's address is #9 East 72nd Street , New York City . Yours very truly , RORF.RT W. SAYLES WE are now in a position , per  --  haps , to put down a chronology : ( 1 ) In 1893 , Gifford Pinchot , twenty-eight years old , prepared a booklet that described the work he was undertaking and planned to undertake near Asheville , North Carolina , at Biltmore Forest  --  a tract of land owned by George Washington Van  --  derbilt , who was engaged also in the building of a large country house , Biltmore , modelled in large part on the chateau of Blois. ( 2 ) In July , 1898 , James Wilson , Secretary of Agriculture under Presi  --  dent McKinley , appointed Pinchot to be Chief Forester in the Department of Agriculture . Pinchot had a tiny staff and no forests to manage . ( 3 ) In the summer of 1898 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just graduated from Harvard College , on Mount Shasta , in California . Pinchot offered Fisher a job for the next summer , and Fisher became one of the " closely knit group of men who helped Mr. Pinchot get the practice of forestry under way . " ( 4 ) On September 14 , 1901 , Presi  --  dent McKinley died from wounds suf  --  fered from an assassin 's bullets , and Theodore Roosevelt assumed the Pres  --  idency . When Roosevelt arrived in Washington , he went to the house of a sister . Pinchot and his colleague Fred  --  erick Newell called on him there . Pin chot was then thirty-six years old . Theodore Roosevelt later wrote , " The first work I took up when I became President was the work of rec  --  lamation . " By " reclamation " he meant in particular forest work and the irrigation of arid lands . In gen  --  eral , he meant a policy that would encourage the proper use of all the nation 's natural resources . ( 5 ) In 1909 , Theodore Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Taft the follow  --  ing year . IN any event , the chronology is a short one . If we put the beginning at 1892 , when Pinchot began his work at Biltmore , the first native-born American trained to be a forester , it encompasses less than twenty years . It must end at 1909 . More than twenty years passed before the government took an active role in conservation again , and then it was an obvious ca  --  tastrophe that gave rise to action : the " dust bowl , " in the plains region . In this case , soil and agriculture were the focus of action . There was among some people an interest in finding a generative symbol in the government 's attempt to conserve the soil , but soon the ethical aspect of soil conservation was forgotten , while the practical les  --  sons were reduced to simple formulas related to immediate yield . The con  --  servation movement of our own day has little to do with either the soil-conserving activity of the nineteen-thirties or the conservative-forestry ethic of the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathological symptoms unimagined by the men we have been discussing ; or he will seek to preserve this or that piece of nature by getting it out of the way of the world 's work . He is , typically , either a scientist expe  --  rienced in toxicology or a lawyer  --  not a farmer or a forester . Pinchot 's idea of conservative for  --  estry , we have said , resembled a nest of cups : practicality and science resting one within the other , and both resting within a conservative ethic that he articulated as " the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time " ? a dictum he later attributed to William J. McGee , an ethnologist he described as " the scientific brains of the Conservation Movement . " This ethic had no consistent advocate within the federal government after 1909 , but it did continue to hold the interest of certain men , whose history we are able to trace . Here is a minor chronology ( to append to the impor  --  tant one above ) , which will lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1898 , Richard Thornton Fisher met Gifford Pinchot on Mount Shasta and became one of " the closely knit group of men who helped Mr. Pinchot get the practice of forestry under way . " ( 2 ) In 1926 , Richard Thornton Fisher walked over a tract of land in Cornwall , New York , with Dr. Er  --  nest Stillman , a son of James Stillman , and urged him to establish a demon  --  stration forest on it . ( 3 ) In 1928 , the Black Rock Forest was established by Dr. Ernest Stillman. ( 4 ) In 1949 , the Black Rock Forest came , with a generous endowment , in  --  to the possession of the President and Fellows of Harvard College . Now we may describe some impor  --  tant aspects of the inheritance that Harvard received when the Black Rock Forest came into its possession : ( 1 ) The ability to do , within the forest , scientific work that had the po  --  tential of wide application . For in  --  stance , Professor Hugh Raup , of the Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was approaching Harvard on the subject of the forest ) : One of the most important features of the Black Rock Forest as a prospective part of the Harvard Forest organization is that it would materially broaden the field for research in hardwood management . It would also afford a wider range of pos  --  sibilities in teaching and research in gen  --  eral Biology . Black Rock is in the oak region so far as upland hardwoods are concerned , whereas we have a strong cle  --  ment of northern hardwoods in Petersham . In the coves at Black Rock they can grow a much more mixed forest than we can here , involving more species of southern and central Appalachian range . But we would have to take note of Professor Raup 's caveat that dyed-in-the-wool laboratory men were " often afraid to work ' in the open field . ' " ( 2 ) The ability to do scientific work of narrow application . Here the case is clear that by 1949 the Black Rock Forest was yielding useful infor  --  mation about the condition of the for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tradition of optimism . The Black Rock Forest had , in 1949 , a better claim than any other organized work of man , not excepting the De ? partment of Agriculture , the Depart  --  ment of the Interior , or the Harvard Forest , in Petersham , to be continuing in an unbroken tradition , from honor  --  able man to honorable man , the idea of conservation which Gifford Pinchot and others brought into American life in the first years of this century ; which Pinchot articulated as an attempt to procure " the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time ; " and which did not exclude from the work of conservation either practical  --  ity or science or morality or art or a sense of the spirit within a landscape but conceived of these aspects of hu  --  man work and perception as constitut  --  ing a part of a whole , which was life , viewed optimistically . I 1940 , Dr. Ernest Stillman wrote 1 to President Conant , of Harvard , and sent with his letter a small essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which included his thoughts on the Black Rock Forest and its future . He wrote : Forestry practice varies so greatly , due to types of trees , climate , and soil , that I believe an intensive study of how to grow most rapidly the most valuable local spe  --  cies of trees on the soil available would accomplish the most good . It is doubtful if even cur large corporations find that scien  --  tific forestry , as practiced today , pays . Cer  --  tainly , the average farmer has little use for forestry . With the passing of large landed estates that is hound to occur , due to taxes in the future , and the economic necessity of more people migrating to the country , the question of the " Farmer 's Wood Lot " will become increasingly important What the farmer wants is an annual supply of fuel , with an occasional load of timbers . At present he obtains this by clean cutting a part of his woods each winter . If , however , it could be definitely shown that by selec  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuel , but after a few years have some ready cash in the form of " saw logs , " he would be interested . Two things must strike the reader . The first is how modest the goals set by Dr. Stillman were from a national or a global point of view . He proposes " an intensive study of how to grow most rapidly the most valuable local species of trees , " a study that must have compelling relevance for a very few people  --  that is , if we are thinking in national or global terms . The sec  --  ond is his prediction that more people will be moving to the country and that " the question of the ' Farmer 's Wood Lot ' will become increasingly impor  --  tant . " Would this prediction have been accepted by many men active in the world of 1940i I do n't think so . Ernest Stillman was looking beyond the active world of 1940 . And was n't there a war in Europe going on at that time which absorbed most of the atten  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , too ? It is in the nature of the conservative forester to qualify every description of events powerful-in-the-moment , perhaps us  --  ing the phrase " but even so . .. " IN 1949 , Dr. Stillman died . In that year , the Black Rock Forest passed to Harvard University . An interesting artifact of that year is Black Rock Forest Paper No. 23 ( Papers were shorter than Bulletins ) , which was written by Dr. Stillman 's son Calvin Stillman . It is entitled " Economic Re  --  lations of the Black Rock Forest . " Calvin Stillman wrote : Unfortunately , today 's mature hard  --  woods germinated while Booth was plot  --  ting the assassination of Lincoln . Thus to be " commercial , " a forestry project has to be allowed a very long period in which to pay off . No matter how much cordwood and minor salable wood products can be culled from a growing stand , the turn-over of the really valuable material is very slow indeed . Let us see what is involved here . Within the long turn-over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elements are insurable  --  which are prop  --  erly called risks . These uncertainties can be bought away by buying insurance , if it is available , with the new uncertainty per  --  haps of collecting from the insurance com  --  pany .... With the long turn-over and the many areas of uncertainty arises the bald prob  --  lem of the return on an investment in forestry . There is nothing intrinsically un  --  profitable about forest enterprises ; other industries may prosper with more serious problems . But it is the bitter truth that when one comes to a real problem in forest management , with actual prices and costs , the conclusion becomes unavoidable that forestry is a safe investment only in the short run . In any longer period too many things can get out of hand : too few factors can be controlled ; too few elements are even relatively certain . Here is a very large area for research in forest econom  --  ics .... The considerations mentioned so far lead to the single proposition which will seem most heretical . This is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as taught , erroneous . The notion of sustained-yield management is wrapped in a aura of nearly religious devotion among foresters ; it ranks high among their concepts of the good , the true , and the beautiful . It is understandable , therefore , if the concept has not been scru  --  tinized with sufficient skepticism .... Sustained-yield management , defined as long-run plans for production of logs or major forest products of any kind , simply does n't make sense in our time . We can be sure of almost nothing . We do n't even know that " there will always be a demand for nice clear logs , " for although someone is sure to want them , we do n't know that they will be in a position to pay what we ask for them . In short , we do n't know what cost and price relationships will be in the future ; we do n't know what the de  --  mand for forest products will be at any level of assumed prices . We do n't know what will happen to taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I submit that ... the Forest should ad  --  just to these uncertainties as data of its problem , and devote its energies to the one factor most surely fixed purescience . I now want to return to a sentence of Henry Tryon 's , used by him in reference to the silvicultural work he was doing in the section of the Black Rock Forest called Glycerine Hollow . He wrote , " We may learn that we are wide of the mark or perhaps we shall be agreeably surprised . " I want to put this sentence in contrast to Calvin Stillman 's statement " We can he sure of almost nothing . " I submit that the very different way in which uncer  --  tainty is handled in the two sentences holds the key to understanding the ingrained pessimism of the modern era . In Calvin Stillman 's view , the enormous uncertainties of the modern world lead one to reject all plans the profits of which can not be realized in a very short time  --  before the world changes again . Henry Tryon 's work , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change for the better , if that may be ) a particular situation in the real world  --  apart from whatever enormously powerful forces are at work ( momentarily ) in the world of men  --  and his sentence reflects this . Calvin Stillman seeks certainty , and finds that the idea that there is profit ( or safety ) in anything other than the certain ( " the one factor most surely fixed " ) is delusion . Henry Tryon seems at home in uncertainty and finds that in uncertainty one may be " agree  --  ably surprised . " If we look at the men  --  tal events behind what Mr. Tryon and Mr. Stillman have said , we find that behind what Calvin Stillman has said is a fight for certainty : for certain safety , for certain profit . Behind what Henry Tryon has said is an admission that the battle has been lost : certain knowledge is not ( at this moment ) available to us ; but work can continue . Notice how the positions reverse : at first , it would seem optimistic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny it ; and yet if one finds that in one 's fight for certainty everything in the real world has be  --  come unknowable or unfriendly to **26;7063;TOOLONG , where is optimism in that ? And if , admitting uncertainty , one continues to do work and to plan for the future ( a more healthy future , if that may be ) , is n't that optimism in fact ? THERE was no strong interest in silviculture at Harvard at the time Harvard acquired the Black Rock Forest . The amount of money retained from the Black Rock Forest endow  --  ment for use within the forest was sufficient to keep the roads in good shape and to pay for the services of a part-time forester , a full-time forest technician , and a part-time crew . The forest was patrolled by a private club , which , in return for its services , was permitted to hunt and fish within the forest . In 1960 , Dr. Ernest Gould , an economist at the Harvard Forest , pub  --  lished an essay ( Harvard Forest Bulle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Harvard Forest . " In many ways , it follows Calvin Still-man 's argument in " Economic Rela  --  tions of the Black Rock Forest . " Dr. Gould explores alternatives to a sus  --  tained-yield system . One theoretical course of action he describes would have had the managers of the Harvard Forest ( headed by Richard Fisher at that time ) sell off all the best-quality saw timber within it " during the high prices of World War I. " In this case , he says , the surplus return over current spending could have been added to the endowment . He wrote : Thus the fifty-year experiment in sus  --  tained yield has cost the Forest nearly $500,000 of additional financial gain that it could have realized had a different man  --  agement program been followed during the last half century . In 1972 , when it appeared that a pumped-storage generating plant that Consolidated Edison proposed to build at Storm King Mountain , in the Hud  --  son Highlands , would take land from the Black Rock Forest , Derek Bok , the president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard 's position should be . The committee said that Harvard should take no position con  --  cerning the building of the plant . The committee recommended that another committee be formed to decide what to do with the Black Rock Forest and with its endowment . The committee itself noted possibilities . The commit  --  tee noted that a private owner of the forest would find that he had a very valuable piece of real estate . The com  --  mittee said that " selling the Forest in lots ( small estates ) of a few acres could raise a lot of money . " The committee said that " Harvard should not think of doing this . " The committee noted that if Consolidated Edison were to build its pumped-storage plant one good re  --  sult might be that it could acquire the forest and give most of it to the Pali  --  sades Interstate Park . The committee noted that there was nothing in Dr. Stillman 's will specifying how Har  --  vard should use the Black Rock Forest . The committee said : Nonetheless , Harvard should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillman which , in so far as they ap  --  pear to the committee , seem to be that Harvard do the best possible forestry re  --  search . The committee reviewed the work that had been done at the forest ( the Bulletins and the Papers ) . The com  --  mittee said : This work is generally rather pedestrian in nature , competent but with little that is novel or imaginative . NONA7 we shall look at the two chronologies we have set down , observing closely what success was achieved . Looking at the major chronology ( 1892-1909 ) , we find a record of suc  --  cess and failure mixed . Pinchot and Roosevelt succeeded in creating a sys  --  tem of national forests which was of wide extent . They did not succeed in their effort to create within these for  --  ests a system of work that would in  --  spire a change in the country 's attitude toward natural resources . Pinchot did not succeed in gathering science , prac  --  ticality , and a sense of the spirit within a landscape into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science and practicality went out into the world alone ; his conservative formula , " the greatest good of the greatest number for the longest time , " was largely for  --  gotten , and the national forests came to he seen as land that had been set aside . By the time a new conservation movement arose , the country had drifted so far into a pessimistic idea of human work that Pinchot 's idea of using a forest was seen as suspect  --  a ploy , a compromise . Conservationists of recent times have perceived the flow as going the other way : not healthy modes of work from the managed for  --  est out into the world of work but pollution from the world of work into the forest . We now look at the minor chronol  --  ogy . Here we see the history of an attempt to keep art optimistic idea of work alive in one place : the Black Rock Forest , in Cornwall , New York . Here we must acknowledge failure . Dr. Ernest Stillman and Henry Try  --  on , working under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " closely knit group of men who helped Mr. Pinchot get the practice of forestry under way " ) , did not succeed in keeping Pinchot 's idea alive on their tract of land . We should note two small excep  --  tions to the statement that the effort of Dr. Stillman and Henry Tryon failed . First , we should note that the money given to Harvard by Dr. Stillman with the forest did not fail . We may now look at a chronology of which money will be the subject . Dr. Stillman established the endow  --  ment of the Black Rock Forest Trust Fund in 1940 . During the period from 1940 to 1949 , the income from this endowment was added to the principal each year . At the end of fis  --  cal 1948-49 , the principal of the en  --  dowment stood at $135,003.69 . To this amount were added the sum real  --  ized from the sale of the Cornwall Press , which came to Harvard in 1949 , when Dr. Stillman died , and the pro  --  ceeds of three life-insurance policies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the end of fiscal 1949-50 , the endowment of the Black Rock Forest Trust Fund stood at $1,154,861.57 . During the years that followed , the endowment of the Black Rock Forest Trust Fund was part of the " commingled funds " that formed the General Investment Account at Harvard . The General Investment Account was operated according to principles that have been described as " prudent " and which seemed almost to shield old endowment funds from the increase in market value of the over  --  all commingled portfolio . A special intermediate device , a Gain and Loss $121,329.36 ; in $133,462.30 ; in $146,808.53 ; in $161,469.38 . There were recorded as well two " capital gains " that reached the fund without going through the Gain and Loss Account : in fiscal 1951-52 , $12,476.81 ; in fiscal 1952 ? 53 , $48,733.44 . One effect of this sys  --  tem was to keep the stated value of the various funds constant over a number of years . The Black Rock Forest fund , for instance , was constant in the amount of $1,776,163.19 from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During fiscal 1969-70 , $45,785 was transferred to the fund from in  --  come . This was the only time during the twenty years from fiscal 1950-51 to fiscal 1969-70 that there was a transfer of income to capital . On June 30 , 1970 , the principal of the Black Rock Forest Trust Fund amounted to $1,821,948.57 . Thus , during the twenty years from the end of fiscal 1949-50 to the end of fiscal 1969-70 the fund had shown an increase in principal of $667,087 . Or , to show this figure as a percentage of the June , 1950 , figure , the fund had grown in twenty years by just under fifty-eight per cent . On July 1 , 1970 , Harvard adopted the market-value method of account  --  ing . By this method , Harvard 's en  --  dowment was transformed into some  --  thing resembling a mutual fund , in which each endowment held a num  --  ber of shares , or units . The crucial point , of course , was how many units would be issued to each existing fund . The Financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : At that time July 1 , 1970 , each endow  --  ment fund and each other holder of a share of these investments was assigned a number of units equal to its proportional share of the market value of those investments . The difficulty was that it was not obvious how the " proportional share of the market value " of the over-all portfolio should he determined for the old endowment funds , since during the years of the Gain and Loss Account system the various endowment funds had not been allowed to reflect market value . For instance , the figure of $1,821,948.57 , which was the stated value of the Black Rock Forest fund as of June 30 , 1970 , could not be used as the sole means of determining the Black Rock Forest fund 's " propor  --  tional share of the market value " of the over-all portfolio , since the system that generated the figure produced a book-value figure that reflected capital gains actually realized and distributed only , and was not allowed to reflect the increase in the " market value " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard Black Rock Forest fund was assigned Par  --  ticipating Units in the number of 21,712.1019 . This figure , as a result of gifts and other changes , had risen to 23,907.3505 as of June 30 , 1983 , when the principal of the fund was list  --  ed as having a worth of $2,490,964 . This amount Harvard proposes to keep when it disposes of the forest . EACH year , the Corporation ar rived at a figure , given as a per percentage , that , when it was applied to the stated value of the principal of the various endowment funds , yielded the " investment income " credited to each of the funds . The Black Rock Forest Trust Fund " earned " income at a rate of around five per cent during most years . Over all , about thirty per cent of this income was spent at the Black Rock Forest and seventy per cent at the Harvard Forest , in Petersham . In establishing the Black Rock Forest fund , Dr. Stillman required that the income be " used to defray the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  est , and , then , the Harvard Forest . " ISET out for Cambridge . On the -1 way , I stayed the night in a dead small city in central Massachusetts , and the next day I went to Cambridge . At the center of the dead small city were large buildings around a square that contained certain official buildings symbolic of the life of the city . The official buildings were intact . Then , around the square : what had been a large hotel had shifted uses ; what had been a large store had shut up . What was alive ? Embassies : branches of in  --  stitutions that collected this or that dollar from people all around the state , all around the country , all around the world , and had decided for this or that reason to continue a physical presence in the old heart of the dead small city . Banks . What was dead ? The forest . IWANT to return one last time to 1 the symbols established within Biltmore Estate . First , to Biltmore House , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems to me that a great mainstream of American thought and action washes around Biltmore House . Biltmore House is everywhere and nowhere . Within Biltmore House we may place Calvin Stillman 's statement " We can be sure of almost nothing .. .. We do n't know what cost and price rela  --  tionships will be in the future . . . We do n't know what will happen to taxes , labor costs , and costs of forest protec  --  tion . . . . I submit that . . . the Forest should adjust to these uncertainties as data of its problem , and devote its energies to the one factor most surely fixed  --  pure science . " Within Biltmore House we may place James Stillman 's description of his daughter 's Presentation gown , E. H. Harriman 's assessment of the incoming Taft Administration , and President-elect Taft 's remark " There is one difficulty about the conservation of natural resources . It is that the imagination of those who are pressing it may outrun the practical facts . " That is , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the science and the technology that underlie the economic life of this country and the practical facts that are consequences of that economic life and , on the other hand , the unconvincing and dreamlike visions of national life which the na  --  tional economic life has encouraged , and which decorate the national eco  --  nomic life and intertwine with it . We may wish , for a moment , to take apart the everywhere-and-nowhere construction ; that is , to separate the one from the other . The everywhere , we now see , is where the money is raised ; the nowhere is where it is spent . And now we are in a position to see the relationship between everywhere and nowhere . If one is living nowhere ( in an imitation of the ch  --  teau of Blois ? ) , the only pleasure is to be re  --  minded that one is a part of something ( even something as abstract as an eco  --  nomic system ) that is going on every  --  where . Nowhere monuments ( like Biltmore House ) are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our day the connections between everywhere and nowhere have been evanescent images . The idea that people once lived ( or tried to live ) in houses that were ev  --  erywhere and nowhere must necessar  --  ily be very interesting to us  --  as inter  --  esting as the idea that a person might actually live in television . Men and women who are content to live in Biltmore House are content not because they have found a way to live there happily but because they know something about how it was con  --  structed ; that is , they know something about what rules are in operation ev  --  erywhere . Nowhere is nowhere for these people , too , but the contempla  --  tion of the rules at work is satisfying to them . Within Biltmore House , there is a sense of satisfaction that one is not , at any rate , bucking the tide . And if , by some chance , a person has been held back by circumstances from living in Biltmore House , there is a pleasant sensation of joining when that person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , in Dr. Ernest Gould 's remark that the fifty-year experiment with sustained-yield management at the Harvard Forest " has cost the Forest nearly $500,000 of additional financial gain ; " and also , of course , in President-elect Taft 's statement " There is one difficulty about the conservation of natural re  --  sources . It is that the imagination of those who are pressing it may outrun the practical facts . " In recent times , to be somewhere has meant not to be everywhere ; it is annoying to ambitious people now to be somewhere . The forest is inevitably somewhere , and we have neglected it . Finally , a word about the arbore  --  tum . I have said that it is here and there . The balance of here is there  --  a place that is here to somebody else . The artifacts in a museum are , or have been , evocative of other particular places in the world in time . One im  --  portant aspect of education involves the collision , in the mind of a person who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his understanding of his own experience and his understanding of the experiences of other men and women , living and dead . Such a colli  --  sion sends a person back to his here with a renewed interest in it . Such a collision is , among other things , a cure for loneliness . The collision between everywhere and nowhere is no such benign thing . Nowhere threatens to obliterate every  --  where in the mind of a person . When the sense of connectedness to every  --  where is broken , even momentarily , the sense of loss to a person living everywhere end nowhere is over  --  whelming . Either a person 's small space within Biltmore House is a van  --  tage point from which he can see  --  everything ; or it is nothing at all . Within Biltmore House , an interest in the way the rules work everywhere usually becomes obsessive , since there is no other source of nourishment . IN Cambridge , Massachusetts , I met with Mr. Daniel Steiner , general counsel to Harvard University , and Dean Richard Leahy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ministration of those research proper  --  ties appended to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of Harvard University which are not near Cambridge , Mas  --  sachusetts . Dean Leahy said , " Various enter  --  prises that do n't admit students are my responsibility . " Mr. Steiner said , " It is that from our point of view , from the point of view of our scientific community in biology , it does not offer anything unique in comparison to a forest much closer and where we have a large fa  --  cility . As a consequence , the amount of research at the Black Rock Forest is limited . " Dean Leahy said , " It is a division of the Harvard Forest , at Petersham . It is n't called that , but that 's the way it is operated . " Dean Leahy said , " There is no School of Forestry at Harvard . Our work in forestry is limited . It is fully contained within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences . There are four men  --  two full professors , one assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernest Gould , at Petersham . You re  --  ally must go to Petersham . In addition to the kinds of facilities you 'd expect , there is a museum , a dormitory , mar  --  ried-student housing . " I said , " If it has come to seem that , from the point of view of your scien JUNE11.1984 tific community in biology , the Black Rock Forest does not offer anything unique in comparison to the Harvard Forest , in Petersham , there must have been a moment when that became clear . Can you tell me how it was in that moment ? " Dean Leahy said , " It is hard to say . " I said , " But there must have been a moment of disappointment . That is to say , at one moment you thought the forest would be useful , and you ac  --  cepted it . At another moment , then , the forest proved to be a disappoint  --  ment , leaving you with a belief that it would be better to part with the for  --  est . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be hard to pick a moment . " I said , " But men at Harvard found that the forest was disappointing to them ? " Dean Leahy said , " Now , I am not an expert in this aspect . My impres  --  sion is that the soil condition is not very good . I think there was heavy glaciation in the area . " Mr. Steiner said , " Remember , we are a teaching and research institution . We are obligated to use funds for teaching and research . " Mr. Steiner said , " We do not con  --  sider that Black Rock Forest is essen  --  tial . " Mr. Steiner said , " Consequently , we have been considering alternative ownership of the forest . " Mr. Steiner said , " But we have no intention of disposing of the forest for development . " Mr. Steiner said , " We have a pas  --  sive , or neutral , stand , and respond to inquiries . " Dean Leahy said , " Bits of it that were acquired afterward might be sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we are talking about perhaps selling separately is thirty , forty acres , not integral to the forest . We are not talking about any kind of development . At the same time , there is a question whether we ought to give the forest away . It represents , perhaps , the endowment of a professorship . " Mr. Steiner said , " If it can be pre  --  served , and funds can be realized to support teaching and research . . " Dean Leahy said , " We would add it to the endowment of the Harvard Forest . " Mr. Steiner said , " Perhaps a profes  --  sorship in Dr. Stillman 's name . .. " Mr. Steiner said , " One of the questions the law deals with is intent . I feel a little awkward here , as though THE NEW YOKKElk I were being asked to be a seer . " Mr. Steiner said , " Who knows most about this ? I think it might he Calvin Stillman , Dr. Stillman 's son . Our records indicate that Calvin Stillman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Steiner said , " Another thing is Calvin Stillman 's professional train  --  ing . " Dean Leahy said , " He 's at Rut  --  gers . " Mr. Steiner said , " In biology . " Dean Leahy said , " No , it 's econom  --  ics , I think . " Mr. Steiner said , " It was Calvin Stillman who dealt with Harvard on the occasion of transfer . " Mr. Steiner said , " It is clear to us that Harvard is not a conservation or  --  ganization . Dr. Stillman understood that . The bequest of the forest is abso  --  lute . To Harvard , without restriction . There is well-known language to he used in wills if you want to restrict a bequest : alternative dispositions of property if the university does not carry out his wishes . He did not use any language of this kind . It is a simple and outright bequest . No re  --  striction . That says an awful lot to me , as a lawyer . I think it would be wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even ex  --  pected , that Harvard would hold on to it . II I were interested in preserving a forest , I would n't give it to a univer  --  sity . At the same time , we 've looked at the land , looked at the area , and it seems inappropriate to sell it for devel  --  opment . Although , under the terms of the will , flat out , we legally could . I will send you a copy of the will . My conscience is clear . " IACKNOWLEDGED that Dr. Ernest Stillman and Henry Tryon had failed in their effort to keep the idea of conservative work alive within the Black Rock Forest , in Cornwall , New York , but we proposed to make two exceptions to the verdict of failure ; that is , we proposed to note two suc  --  cessful aspects of their effort . We did note that the money given by Dr. Still  --  man to Harvard to support the forest and the work he was doing in it , com  --  mingled , as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quickly worked its way into the life of the university ; and although its rate o growth has always been modest , and almost humble , certainly it has not been forgotten , nor has anyone pro  --  posed to do away with it . There is another aspect of work in the Black Rock Forest which was suc  --  cessful . This is found within the Bulletins . They are octavo volumes , hound in green paper . They have on the cover the device of the forest : con  --  centric circles enclosing the words " The Black Rock Forest Cornwall  --  on-the-Hudson , New York " and then , at the center , a depiction of Black Rock Mountain . They are well made and well printed . Henry Tryon , who wrote many of them , had a clear , unaffected prose style , well matched to the conservative work he was do  --  ing . Bulletin No. 4 , " A Portable Char  --  coal Kiln , " was published in 1933 . It was written by Henry Tryon . The work it describes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in na  --  ture , competent but with little that is novel or imaginative . Aspects of local history are men  --  tioned : Even before the Revolutionar7 War the manufacture of hardwood charcoal was a common thing in the Hudson Highlands , and in the Sha  --  angunk and Catskill Mountains . The open-pit process was the method generally used until about 1875 , when the appearance of metal ovens or kilns , designed primarily for the destruc  --  tive distillation of hardwoods , liberated such quantities of low-priced high-grade charcoal that the operators of open pits were forced to discontinue except where their location afforded an unusually favor  --  able combination of a supply of raw mate  --  rial with a nearby market . A local condition is discussed ; a tool is designed to fit into the local condi tion ; the operation of the tool is de  --  scribed : Nearly all of the preliminary cuttings on the Forest have been weedings , improve  --  ment cuttings , or light thinnings , yielding fairly large amounts of wood suitable only for fuel . The market for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oil , gas , or electric stoves , combined with coal-burning furnaces in residences . In order to find an outlet for our surplus low-grade wood , the local charcoal market was investigated . The Black Rock Forest portable kiln is made of light steel , in two sections , with a coned lid . The bottom section is No. 14- gauge sheet metal , the upper section and the lid are No. 16-gauge . This construc  --  tion was adopted because the lower sec  --  tion has to bear the highest temperatures and also is seldom lifted clear of the ground . The top section and the lid do not have to withstand such heat , and when the kiln is being placed over a charge both of these elements must be lifted at least four feet . PILING THE MAIN CHARGE . Piling is begun with a double circle of dry wood placed vertically around the chimney . All wood is stacked directly on the ground and as tight together as possi JUNE II , 1984 ble . The sticks should be both selected and placed with care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle with the big wood , working steadily around the stack . The entire charge may fall down if the chimney be not kept as near the center of the stack as possible . Use limb-wood in the outer portions of the stack . Do not build the pile out to the full diameter of the cleared circle ; it is best to leave it a trifle undersize and complete it after plac  --  ing the kiln shell . The failure of the Black Rock For  --  est was on a small scale ; it was more to be compared to the withering away of a limb on the body of an endowment than to a bank failure or the failure of an enormous enterprise in which vast amounts of borrowed money have been sunk . One remembers that Harvard is now entangled in an enormous enter  --  prise . Harvard has pledged its full faith and credit in the amount of some three hundred and fifty million dollars ( an amount equal to the final goal of Harvard 's recent fund drive ) as securi  --  ty for bonds issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginative ) whose purpose is to supply the power needs of a complex of buildings it runs in Boston . Here we may find the re  --  verse of the coin : money withering on the body of an outlying project . And success within the Black Rock Forest was small , too . And yet any effort that meets a certain standard of clarity and sense participates in the continuity of clarity and sense which runs like a small channel throughout history . The writing of Henry Tryon , for instance  --  what can we say about it ? It is competent and pedestrian  --  let 's be  --  gin with that . As we admit that we look in vain for the novel and the imaginative , let us try to remember that the novel and the imaginative may take us in more than one direc  --  tion . HARVARD THERE is now a publication called Harvard Magazine . The issue of May-June , 1981 , had on its cover a striking picture of an old Asian man . His face was full of dig  --  nity . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone to this dignity . There were lines of type in the lower left-hand corner of the cover . The upper lines referred to this picture . They read : The manongs of California They came from the Philippines to Ameri  --  can farms . Their harvest was discrimina  --  tion and poverty The other lines of type were de THE NEW YORKER scriptive of other articles to be found in the magazine . They read : THE SCIENCE WATCH : William Bennett on new cancer research " The monstrous diary of a rather mon  --  strous man ... " DEREK BOK ON BUSINESS AND THE ACADEMY : The use and abuse of professo  --  rial talent The first page of this issue of Harvard Magazine was devoted to a commercial evocation of Harvard . There were illustrations of dinner plates decorated with Harvard scenes . It was remarkable that all the scenes were in the past . A scene of Harvard Yard in 1858 was the closest in time to our own day . Others were much ear  --  lier . The place of emphasis was given to the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westerly view of Harvard College 1767 . " President Bok 's article , " Business and the Academy , " dealt with a very interesting issue . The issue was : Should Harvard University , for the sake of money , participate in business ventures designed to exploit research done at Harvard in recombinant DNA ? The article was written shortly after Harvard decided not to partici  --  pate in such activities . The decision was not entirely a happy one . When Harvard is asked " Engage in business ventures ? " Harvard answers " No . " But Harvard looked at the suitor . Harvard noticed that the suitor was rich . Harvard heaved a sigh . President Bok 's article begins with this account : On a crisp autumn morning last Octo  --  ber , 1 awoke to find my own likeness star  --  ing forth from the front page of the New York Times under the caption " Harvard Considers Commercial Role in DNA Research . " The story went on to declare that the University was about to decide whether " to play a leading role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Harvard biochemists would use the methods of recombinant DNA to develop commercially profitable products . Accord  --  ing to the writer , Harvard 's deliberations were being closely watched by other insti tutions considering similar opportunities . A decision to go forward and join in such an enterprise would constitute a new de  --  parture in American higher education that could transform the very nature of re  --  search universities . During the weeks that followed , articles appeared in dozens of newspapers and magazines describing the merits and de  --  merits of entering into commercial ven  --  tures of this kind . Scientists and editorial writers quickly volunteered their own opinions on the issue . Letters poured in from entrepreneurs eager to learn of our plans and to explore ways in which they might participate . Once again , the Times had succeeded in transforming our quiet intramural discussions into a public issue of national proportions . It may be important to follow the progress of these two paragraphs . On a crisp autumn morning last Octo  --  ber , I awoke to find my own likeness star  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times . The pivot is in the crisp autumn morning . In that phrase is all Harvard to people who have been at Harvard . I awoke to find my own likeness staring forth from the front page of the New York Times . We have moved , quite efficiently ' , from the crisp autumn of all Ilarvards to the crisp autumn of President Bok 's Harvard and to the newspaper that President Bok is reading . Notice that Harvard has been established in a cer  --  tain way , President Bok at Harvard has been established in a certain way . Whatever happens now in the newspa  --  per will appear in juxtaposition with the scene as it has been established : Harvard , autumn , President Bak se  --  renely going about his business . What has been established is : Har  --  vard as a backwater ; I larvard as a back  --  water with its own pretty ways ; the world interested in Harvard ; the world eager ( and sometimes overeager ) to report on events going on at Har  --  vard ; the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong . Let us go on . For amusement 's sake , let us make up a story ( to compare with President Bok 's ) in which the great world will intrude on Harvard  --  with amusing results . On a crisp autumn morning last Octo  --  ber , I awoke to find my own likeness star  --  ing forth from the front page of the New York Times under the headline " Harvard to Shorten Parental Visits . " Failing to un  --  derstand the fine distinction we make here at Harvard between visits " parietal " and visits " parental , " the active news gatherers of the Times had raised up rather an unnecessary stir , as I discovered when , ten minutes later , I suffered the angry words of the mother of one of our best oarsmen ( stroke to our first eight , in fact ) , who called by telephone to announce that if it were true that she was no longer to be allowed to visit her son in his rooms she would see to it that he transferred to Yale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake about what is going on at Harvard . My story de  --  scribes a certain Harvard context , well known to its graduates . It introduces into this context a flap . It introduces people who do not understand Har  --  vard and who may , through their clum  --  siness , cause trouble to Harvard . Now we will spend some time with President Bok 's paragraphs . THE NEW YOKKER . The story went on to declare that the University was about to decide whether " to play a leading role in founding a ge  --  netic-engineering company , " in which Harvard biochemists would use the meth  --  ods of recombinant DNA to develop com  --  mercially profitable products . If one reads this sentence marking especially the text and subtext of the phrase " the story went on to declare " and the fact that the article is quoted directly , and not paraphrased , to what conclusion does one find that it moves ? I think it is to the conclusion that the university was about to do no such thing . President Bok quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet the newspaper was not in error . The newspaper had accurately reported important events taking place at Harvard . Please see how the story is being abused . Which story ? The story of Harvard in juxtaposition with the out  --  side world , which I have epitomized in a story in which the outside world makes a silly error . How abused ? My sort of story , a story of the old Har  --  vard , is being used as a trench from which to fight a battle . The story of old Harvard has been wrenched out of shape to accommodate very serious business . Its essence has been removed , and it has been supplied with a new substance , which must pollute it . At each turn in the story ( for sto  --  ries , however carefully controlled , re  --  veal truth always , in the same way that posed photographs do , which show the aspirations within the pose ) , President Bok returns to Mji story , the story of Harvard in the age of airs and graces , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would watch a military exercise  --  for this is what it is , within the context of public relations . He begins in the sector of airs and graces . It is autumn , he is reading a newspaper . To his surprise , he sees his own picture . Now he is exposed for a moment . He must deal with the fact that a newspaper has printed an accu  --  rate story about an important develop  --  ment taking place at Harvard . He must proceed cautiously here . He may not say that the newspaper is in error , but he may put a distance between himself and the story . He does this by quoting the newspaper article so that the issue of Harvard 's experiments with DNA , Harvard 's interest in ex  --  ploiting its research in DNA for profit , is emplaced within another is  --  sue , the issue of Harvard stirred up by the press , which , in turn , may be em  --  placed within still another , older issue ? of Harvard and the outside world . The no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a reader is attentive , he will say , " Stop , stop . Was it correct , the article ? Were you  --  are you  --  considering such a thing ? " If , however , the reader is inattentive or if he is lost in the crisp autumn morning of his own Harvard , President Bak will succeed in transporting him over the dangerous patch into theft* Here President Bok is on safe ground and may pivot hack into the safe Harvard sector from which he began . Note that President Bok 's treatment of the flap resembles the treatment of the Pip in my story . He says that " articles ap  --  peared in dozens of newspapers and magazines describing the merits and demerits of entering into commercial ventures of this kind , " and he seems bemused . He says , " Scientists and edi  --  torial writers quickly volunteered their own opinions on the issue , " and he makes them sound like ladies in flow  --  ered hats . The real story is the reverse of the Harvard - against - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : There is no distance now between Harvard and the outside world ; you could not find the boundary . The context of Harvard is the same as the context of the Times , which is the large context of the whole country of two hundred million peo- ple . The Times has understood the story perfectly . President Bak moves from his dis  --  cussion of the stir caused by the Times to a laying out of the issues : Eventually , after Harvard announced its decision not to proceed , the public debate began to subside . But issues had clearly been raised that provoked deep concern in many quarters . Should universities be more aggressive in seeking to participate in the commercial exploitation of the knowledge produced in their laboratories ? Might efforts of this kind produce a new source of revenue to counteract the financial pres  --  sures facing research institutions ? Could universities enter the marketplace without subverting their commitment to learning and discovery ? These questions will doubtless remain with us for some time to come . Together , they offer an intriguing opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the university in translating scientific discov  --  eries into useful products and innovations . Follow the movement of this para  --  graph . First , again , the fidp , which has subsided . The agitation has ceased . Still , there is deep concern in many quarters . Here President Bok makes room for what must already be in the minds of many readers . Yes , of course , people would be concerned about Harvard 's going into business . He minimizes this existing impression by placing it " in many quarters " ? which is to say , not in any place you and I know or want to name  --  and then he pivots away from the existing impression to an entirely different con  --  cern , which no one has voiced , which is : How should Harvard now approach business ? The first " concern " he men  --  tions is : Should universities be more aggressive in seeking to participate in the commercial exploitation of the knowledge produced in their laboratories ? This , I 'm afraid , is propaganda writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into busi  --  ness feels in reading it that his concern is being addressed . And yet his con  --  cern has been placed in a context he would not have foreseen . Let us say that the uppermost edge of his concern has been placed within President Bok 's sentence , so that President Bok may say , " Yes , here it is , " and yet one can not help noticing that this concern is at the very bottom of the new con  --  text that President Bok is creating . Such is the ambiguity of the sentence that it would be possible for a person to derive from it the sense that people in some quarters were upset that Harvard had failed to be sufficiently aggressive in marketing the results of its scientific research and now the president of the university was being called upon to defend his backward  --  ness . The next sentence does nothing to undo this impression ; in fact , in introducing " the financial pressures facing research institutions " it makes a person think , Yes , really , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . Finally , we come to what might be a concern of a certain group of people : " Could universities enter the marketplace without sub  --  verting their commitment to learning and discovery ? " But that group of people is here a group that has decided " Yes , of course , do consider an alli  --  ance with the world of commerce , but make sure you do n't subvert your com  --  mitment to learning and discovery . " Anyone saying " No , do n't do it " has to find a home in this group . " No , do n't do it ! " people shout from some quarters . " I know just what you mean , " President Bok says . " No , do n't ever do it . " " Quite right . Without the proper safeguards .. . " " No , I mean you should n't even consider . . . " " Doing it without the proper safe guards , certainly not , " President Bok says , and he walks to his conclu  --  sion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intriguing opportunity to discuss the state of academic science , " and that he now finds , after this good , healthy , frank exchange , that he wants to " explore the proper role of the university in translating scientific dis  --  coveries into useful products and in  --  novations . " IWANT to mention the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company here . Recently , advertisements for Morgan Guaranty have begun to identify the company as " The Morgan Bank . " This used to be a private name for the company , employed by people who identified it with the financial patriar  --  chy of New York . I think the name is being used magically . That is , I think that as institutions bearing old names go out into the world now they hope that by speaking their old names they will he safer . I do n't think that Presi  --  dent Bok of Harvard wants , any more than the officers of the Morgan Guar  --  anty Trust Company want , actually to transform the world of impersonal forces and trends into a world of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only wants the forces to halt on command , to stop still at the mention of a certain name . The power of the impersonal world can be seen in Presi  --  dent Bok 's prose . When the world of **29;7091;TOOLONG is not being specifically invoked , it van  --  ishes from around him . His article " Business and the Academy " is peo  --  pled with men and women , but sparsely . I want to discuss now a reference he makes to Pyotr Kapitsa , the eminent Soviet physicist . President Bok knows Kapitsa through an article in Science which gave a brief account , in 1966 , of an address that Kapitsa made to the Royal Society . Kapitsa spoke , on that occasion , about his friend Lord Ruth  --  erford , the great British physicist , and about his association with him . Science quoted a little of his speech in an article just over two pages long . One of the paragraphs of direct quotation is quoted , in turn , by President Bok , as relevant to his own concern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the ideal of the disinterest  --  ed scientist begins to he replaced by that of the wealthy professor-en  --  trepreneur . " Notice that Kapitsa 's statements are as clear as glass but that to President Bok they are puz  --  zling . THE NEW YORKER President Bok says : Notwithstanding these outward signs of strength , one senses an unease in many scientific circles , a fear that the sheer size , complexity , and expense of modern science may have a corrupting effect on quality . As the Soviet physicist Pyotr Kapitsa once declared , " the year Rutherford died 19371 there disappeared forever the happy days of free scientific work which gave us such delight in our youth . Science has lost her freedom . Science has become a productive force . She has become rich but she has become enslaved and part of her is veiled in secrecy . " The causes of this anxiety are not entirely clear . Perhaps there is concern that " big science " can bring undue re  --  wards to people who seem more noted for their entrepreneurial talents than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no longer enough time for referees to read papers with sufficient care or for senior investigators to exercise close supervision over younger associates . Perhaps professors feel that the direction of their work is imperceptibly passing from their hands and that research will increas  --  ingly be shaped to conform with restric  --  tions imposed by those who control the funds , Whatever the reason , the concerns do exist and must be watched with the greatest care . Notice . Notice . Kapitsa says , " She has become rich but she has become enslaved . " Bok says , " Perhaps scientists fear that there is no longer enough time for referees to read papers with sufficient care . " IT is possible to understand events taking place now by getting to know the history of the work of which they are a result . The large imper  --  sonal forces that rule the world now were set in motion by persons-at-work . But it is hard . It is as though at a certain point records ceased to be kept . But that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get at them . The history of recent work has somehow failed to stick in people 's minds . This has to do , I think , with the fact that the results of successful work are now dispersed throughout the world in such a way that they disappear ; that is , they are not linked to any place . What will happen , for instance , when the financial life of the nation is no longer associated with Wall Street is very hard to predict . When the financial life of the nation is a matter of events taking place in the air ( retrieved for a moment on this or that screen ) , will it be possible to raise a child to believe in it ? It is difficult to tell the story of any particular event now because the old backgrounds against which a particular event would have meaning ( Harvard and Wall Street , for example ) are unreliable , and yet they are all we have . That is why entertainment stories are set in the past , or are absurd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some person 's personal problems . To construct , through diligent thought , a true background against which events of this moment might be juxtaposed is the work of art now . Since this short history of the Har  --  vard Black Rock Forest has been dif  --  ficult to construct ( because the fore  --  ground and the background were be  --  ing constructed at the same time ) , I should , perhaps , include a summary of what I think is important in what I have written . First in importance is the image I put forward at the beginning . Two men , one a forester , the other a very rich man , stand on a tract of land . They first look at the land , which has been damaged and exploited . Then they look at an incomplete limestone palace . Second in importance is the history of the men in the image : Gifford Pinchot and George Washington Vanderbilt . I mention George Wash  --  ington Vanderbilt here especially be  --  cause his idea  --  to build a palace in Zmerica  --  will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted by Americans . But : he needs Gifford Pinchot at his side . In my image , he has him . Thirdly , the various symbols with  --  in the Biltmore Estate : corresponding to what is everywhere and nowhere ; here and there ; and mostly here . I par  --  ticularly want to direct the reader 's attention to the dif  --  ference between the qual  --  ities of the science of sil  --  viculture , which is embed  --  ded in a context ( the forest ) , and the qualities of what Calvin Stillman called " pure science , " and to suggest that " pure science " must learn from silviculture how to behave as though it were embedded in a context . The job , it seems to me , is to transform " the scientific method , " which is free in a way that human beings never can be free , into " sci  --  ence , " a collegial system that would recognize , as silviculture does , that life goes on in particular places and that " the longest time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider . At last , the history of the Black Rock Forest , ending in the history of Harvard 's unsatisfactory stewardship . Here , first of all , I would like to pay my respects to Ernest Stillman . In JUNE 11 , 1984 America , it is very often out of the work of men like Dr. Stillman that good developments are allowed to take place . Dr. Stillman held to the ideal of the constantly flourishing forest long after its vogue had ended . A specific proposal of mine would be that Har  --  vard he asked to transfer the forest and its endowment to an independent foundation that would continue to pursue the silvicultural work begun by Ernest Stillman and Henry Tryon . No hasty action will do justice to what Dr. Stillman began  --  we remember that he rejected the idea of a private founda  --  tion because its plan of work would be " too narrow " ? but I am convinced that the integrity of his ideal will be better protected now by a dedicated private group than by any large insti  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is of two kinds  --  usefulness that was foreseen by Dr. Stillman and use  --  fulness that was not foreseen by him . Dr. Stillman was right : the farmer 's woodlot is important now . He was right : large numbers of people have moved to the country . What he did not foresee was that the scientific data col  --  lected within the forest might be useful as a base against which to measure levels of toxicity ( in measuring acidity due to acid rain , for instance ) . And yet he did foresee it ; that is , he foresaw that patient work within the forest would produce benefits he could not foresee . As to Harvard 's unsatisfactory stewardship of the forest : the weight of all evidence I have seen is against Daniel Steiner 's statement that " it would he wrong to make an assump tion that Dr. Stillman had required , or even expected , that Harvard would hold on to " the forest . There is a concept in conservative for estry called the Permanent Association . The Perma nent Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trees toward which all the various succes sions of dominance are tending . It is also called the climax forest . Such a forest , when handled with respect , will yield a handsome profit , and will re turn to health of itself : it is the con stantly useful , constantly nourishing forest . In human affairs , it would be : a stable civilization . In America , this would be : a stable American civiliza tion . It is my conviction that Ernest Stillman was one of those American men ( Gifford Pinchot was another ; THE NEW YORKER Theodore Roosevelt was another ) who believed that it was important to work toward that ideal however much the ( so-called ) " practical facts " spoke of its impracticability , however much promises of vast wealth spoke of its irrelevance , however much cataclys  --  mic world events spoke of its small  --  ness . Dr. Stillman , I know , thought of Harvard University as the strong home in American life of those persons who were working toward a discovery of what a Permanent Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been that ( Theodore Roosevelt , Franklin Roosevelt , and John Ken  --  nedy are among its graduates ) , and it might be again . FRIENDS FINALLY , I would like to return to some of the questions to which President Bok of Harvard said he had no very good answers . Why is there " unease " in " many scientific circles " ? What is the proper relationship be  --  tween a scientist working at a univer  --  sity and the world of business ? We turn to Pyotr Kapitsa 's address to the Royal Society  --  to which President Bok has himself referred . Let this be symbolic of what I want to say to President Bok : You have good infor  --  mation close to hand , and you may still decide to use it . Kapitsa 's address to the Royal Society , briefly reported in Science , appears in his " Collected Pa  --  pers , " under the title " Recollections of Lord Rutherford . " It is an affectionate work  --  we no  --  tice that . We notice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has great force . Events are not shapeless . It is a question of men at work . Notice the pencil of Lord Rutherford  --  how it has stayed in the mind of the great Russian physicist  --  and notice how the words of a Ukrainian philosopher have stayed in the mind of the great Soviet physicist , and how simplicity is not ignored . Mr. Kapitsa says : Rutherford also liked talking about his own experiments . When he was explaining something he usually made drawings . For this purpose he kept small bits of pencil in his waistcoat pocket . He held them in a peculiar way  --  it always seemed to me a very inconvenient one  --  with the tips of his fingers and thumb . He drew with a slightly shaky hand , his drawings were always simple and consisted of a few thickly drawn lines , made by pressing hard on the pencil . More often than not the point of the pencil broke and then he would take another bit from his pocket . A number of physicists , especially theo  --  reticians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of argument is a way of thinking . I never heard Rutherford argue about science . Usually he gave his views on the subject very briefly , with the maxi  --  mum of clarity and very directly . If any  --  body contradicted him he listened to the argument with interest but would not an  --  swer it and then the discussion ended . I greatly enjoyed Rutherford 's lectures . I followed the course of general physics which he gave to the undergraduates as Cavendish Professor . I did not learn much physics from this course since by that time I already possessed a fair knowledge of the subject , but from Rutherford 's approach to it I learned a great deal . Rutherford deliv  --  ered his lectures with great enthusiasm . He used hardly any mathematical formu  --  lae , he used diagrams widely and accompa  --  nied his lectures with very precise but restrained gestures from which it could be seen how vividly and picturesquely Ruth  --  erford thought . I found it interesting that during the lecture he changed the topic as his thoughts , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . This was usually connected with some new experiments made in the field of ra  --  dioactivity which fascinated him and he then proceeded to speak with enthusiasm on the new subject . In this case he usually , put his assistant in a difficult position by asking him to give a demonstration which was not part of the original planned ver  --  sion , When I came to Cambridge Rutherford did no inure experimental work by himself ; he worked chiefly either with Chadwick or with Ellis . But in both cases he took an active part in experiments . The setting up of the apparatus was done mainly by his laboratory assistant , Crow , whom he treated rather severely . But I sometimes saw how Rutherford himself , despite his slightly shaking hands , dealt quite skill  --  fully with the fine-walled glass tubes filled with radium emanation . Although Ruther  --  ford 's experiments are well known , I can  --  not refrain from saying a few words about them . The most attractive thing about these experiments was the clarity of setting the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem were most remarkable . From my long ex  --  perience as an experimenter I have learned that the best way of correctly evaluating the capacity of a beginner as well as of a mature scientist is by his natural inclina  --  tion and ability to find a simple way of solving problems . There is an excellent saying by an unknown French author which applies perfectly to Rutherford : " La simplicite rest la plus grande sagesse. " 1 should also like to quote the profound saying of a Ukrainian philosopher , Greg  --  ory Skovoroda . He was by origin a peasant and lived in the second half of the eigh  --  teenth century . His writings are most in  --  teresting but probably quite unknown iii England . He said " We must be grateful to God that He created the world in such a way that everything simple is true and everything complicated is untrue . " Ruth  --  erford 's finest and simplest experiments concerned the phenomena of scattering by nuclear collisions . The methods of obser  --  vation of scintillations by counters were worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then more than half a century has passed and this method and the Wilson chamber invented about the same time remain the fundamental methods for studying nuclear phenomena , and only the optical and resonance meth  --  ods for determining nuclear moments have since been added . And up to now all nu  --  clear physics possesses no experimental possibilities other than those used by Ruth  --  erford and his collaborators . The present development of nuclear physics is proceed  --  ing not by the invention of new experi  --  mental possibilities of investigating nu  --  clear phenomena but thanks to the possi  --  bility of investigating nuclear collisions of a larger number of elements ; and these collisions are studied in the domain of larger energies which are reached mainly by the use of powerful modern accelera  --  tors . But even now the way which leads us to the knowledge of the nucleus is still The method discovered by Rutherford , and he was the first to appreciate its fundamental value . I am referring here to the investiga  --  tion of the collision of nuclei . Rutherford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Finally , I should like to discuss a ques  --  tion I have come across several times in descriptions of Rutherford 's activities . The question is : did Rutherford foresee the great practical consequences which would emerge from his scientific discoveries and investigations into radioactivity ? The immense reserves of energy which are hidden in matter were understood by physicists a long time ago . The develop  --  ment of his view took place side by side with the development of the theory of relativity . The question which was not clear at that time was : would it eventually he possible to find technical means of mak  --  ing practical use of these reserves ? We know now that the actual possibility of obtaining energy from nuclear collisions was becoming more and more real as nu clear phenomena were better understood . But up to the last moment it was not certain whether it would be technically possible to produce nuclear reactions with a great yield of energy . I remember only rare occasions on which I discussed this question with Rutherford and in all these conversations he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my acquaintance with Rutherford I noticed that he never took any interest in technical problems and I even had the impression that he was prejudiced about applied problems . Possi  --  bly this was because such problems were connected with business interests . I am by training a chartered engineer and naturally I always took an interest in solving technical problems . During my stay in Cambridge I was approached sev  --  eral times to help in solving technical problems in industry . In these cases I used to take advice from Rutherford and he always said to me : " You can not serve God and Mammon at the same time . " Of course he was right . Once I remember Rutherford telling me about Pupin who as an able young physicist had come to Cam  --  bridge and done successful scientific work in the Cavendish Laboratory . Pupin was somewhat senior to Rutherford so they met only occasionally . Eventually Pupin turned to commercial activity in the U.S.A. and made a lot of money . Ruther  --  ford spoke disapprovingly of Pupin 's activi  --  ties , So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical applications of nu  --  clear physics had no real value as they lay outside the scope of his interests and tastes . In connection with Rutherford 's views on industry I remember a conversation 1 had with him during a high table dinner at Trinity College . I do not remember how the conversation started , maybe it was under the influence of Lornbroso 's book " Genius and Madness . " I was telling my neighbor that every great scientist must be to some extent a madman . Rutherford overheard this conversation and asked me , " In your opinion , Kapitsa , am I mad too ? " " Yes , Professor , " I replied . " How will you prove it ? " he asked . " Very simply , " I replied . " Maybe you remember a few days ago you mentioned to me that you had had a letter from the U.S-A. , from a big American company . ( I do not remember now which one it was , possibly General Electric Co . ) In this let  --  ter they offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay you a fabulous salary . You only laughed at the offer and would not consider it serious  --  ly . I think you will agree with me that from the point of view of an ordinary man you acted like a madman ! " Rutherford laughed and said that in all probability I was right , The last time I saw Rutherford was in the autumn of 1934 when I went as usual to the Soviet Union to see my mother and my friends and unexpectedly was deprived of the possibility of returning to Cam  --  bridge . I did not hear his voice again , nor hear him laugh , For the next three years I had no laboratory to work in and was unable to continue my scientific work and the only scientist with whom I freely cor  --  responded outside Russia was Rutherford . At least once every two months he wrote me long letters which I greatly valued . in these letters he gave me an account of life in Cambridge , spoke about the scientific achievements of himself and his pupils , wrote about himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up in my difficult position . He understood that the important thing for me was to start my scientific work which had been interrupted for several years . It is no secret that it was only due to his intervention and help that 1 was able to obtain the scientific installation and apparatus of the Mond Laboratory and in three years time I was able to renew my work in the domain of low-temperature physics . I am sure that in the course of time all Rutherford 's letters will be published , but even so I should like here and now to quote three short extracts which require no comment . On 21 November 1935 he wrote : " ... I am inclined to give you a little advice , even though it may not be neces  --  sary . I think it will he important for you to get down to work on the installation of the laboratory as soon as possible , and try to train your assistants to be useful . I think you will find many of your troubles will fall from you when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your rela  --  tions with the authorities will improve at once when they sec that you are working wholeheartedly to get your show going . I would not worry toe much about the atti  --  tude or opinions of individuals , provided they du not interfere with your work . I daresay you will think I do not understand the situation , but I am sure that chances of your happiness in the future depend on your keeping your nose down to the grind THE NEW YORKER stone in the laboratory . Too much intro  --  spection is had for anybody ! ... " On 15 May 1936 he wrote : " ... This term I have been busier than I have ever been , but as you know my tem  --  per has improved during recent years , and I am not aware that anyone has suffered from it for the last few weeks ! ... " ... Get down to some research even though it may not be of an epoch-mak  --  ing kind as soon as you can and you will feel happier . The harder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As you know . ' a reasonable number of fleas is good for a dog ' ? but I expect you feel you have more than the average num  --  ber ! " You see what short and clear and fa  --  therly advice he gave me . The last letter is dated 9 October 1937. lie wrote in great detail about his proposed journey to India . In the last part of the letter he said : " ... T am glad to say that 1 am feeling physically pretty fit , but I wish that life was not quite so strenuous in term time .... " Ten days before his death he did not feel that it was so near . For me the death of Rutherford meant not only the loss of a great teacher and friend ; for me , as for a number of scientists , it was also the end of a whole epoch in science . Obviously we should attribute to those years the beginning of the new period in the history of human culture which is now called the scientific-technical revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the use of atomic energy . We all know that the consequences of this revolution may be very terrible  --  it may destroy mankind . In 1921 Rutherford warned me not to make any Communist propaganda in his laboratory , but it now appears that just at that time he himself , together with his pupils , was laying the foundations for a scientific-technical revo  --  lution . We all hope that in the end people will have sufficient wisdom to direct this scien  --  tific revolution to the benefit of humanity . But nevertheless the year that Ruther  --  ford died there disappeared forever the happy days of free scientific work which gave us such delight in our youth . Science has lost her freedom . Science has become a productive force . She has become rich but she has become enslaved and part of her is veiled in secrecy . I do not know whether Rutherford would continue nowadays to joke and laugh as he used to do . ? GEoRcr . W. S. TRow ?
