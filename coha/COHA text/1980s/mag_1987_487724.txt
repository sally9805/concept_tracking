On November 29 the presidents of eight Latin American countries , meeting in Acapulco , Mexico , expressed their common concern about the region 's onerous burden of foreign debt and proposed limited interim measures for easing their repayment difficulties . The following article provides a backdrop to the Acapulco summit , which was held without representatives from the United States . PENNY LERNOUX The scene in Lima in October , when the government nationalized Peru 's banks , resembled one of Mario Vargas Llosa 's bizarre tales . As police tanks broke into the barricaded buildings , rebellious bankers inside , with beds and enough food and water for a long siege , vowed to retain control of their institutions : " Only the dead will be taken from our properties ! " they declared . No one died , or was even hurt , when antiriot police stormed the locked doors with tanks and tear gas , but the assault outraged Peru 's financial leaders and is bound to complicate government efforts to keep the economy afloat . Had Vargas Llosa scripted the story , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outcry by the political right against the nationalization legislation . Although Peruvian bankers have carried on something fierce ? " An ignominious act against defenseless persons ! " said the president of the banking association  --  and talk of a coup is rife , nationalization of the financial sector is not unprecedented in Latin America . In 1982 Mexico expropriated its banks , and the governments of both Colombia and Brazil have taken over numerous banks . The causes , including self-lending , currency speculation , a prominent role in capital flight and excessive concentration of financial power , were similar to those that led to the Peruvian intervention of thirty-three banks , insurance and finance companies . As in Mexico , the move was also politically motivated  --  an act of insubordination against the international banking community , which has replaced the oil companies as the most hated foreign business interest in Latin America . Alan Garcia Perez , Peru 's brash young President , threw down the gauntlet when he took office , in 1985 , by announcing that Peru would pay no more than 10 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in most Latin American countries , the Peruvian economy was in deep recession because of its enormous debt payments . Triple-digit inflation , a 65 percent unemployment and underemployment rate and a sharply declining standard of living provided a breeding ground for crime , the cocaine traffic and a flourishing guerrilla movement . Garcia , who was the first president to be elected on the ticket of the centrist American Popular Revolutionary Alliance , opted for a radical approach . " APRA did n't struggle for sixty years to obtain power just to administer the poverty of Peru , " he said . The tactic of placing a ceiling on debt servicing paid off last year when inflation dropped to 68 percent and the gross national product grew by 8.5 percent . But the situation is no longer so promising , because the government has had to run down its currency reserves to finance economic expansion . Tax evasion and capital flight have cost Peru $600 million this year , and even short-term credits for imports have dried up . Inflation is climbing back up toward 90 percent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalization of the banks was a popular measure-60 percent of Peruvians polled supported the takeover  --  the extent to which it will benefit the economy is questionable , since a high percentage of the banks ' reserves were withdrawn by frightened investors who anticipated the expropriation . Predictably , the reaction among foreign bankers was negative , but since Peru is unable to obtain new loans in any case , it hardly matters . " We may not have dollars today , " Garcia told a Colombian journalist , " but we would n't have grown , either . With foreign loans a country does not grow but becomes more impoverished . " Although similar sentiments have been expressed by governments throughout the region , none have found a formula to resolve the impasse , and most are reluctant to follow Peru 's example . Contrary to Garcia 's expectations that other countries would also limit debt payments to below 20 percent of export earnings , they have continued a hopeless minuet with the foreign banks through endless debt reschedulings . Some have fallen behind on debt payments , while a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped paying . Last February the debt dance entered a new phase when Brazil announced a suspension of interest payments , thereby endangering the stability of U.S. banks , which hold the lion 's share of Brazil 's $115 billion foreign debt . But even this tactic failed to nudge the bankers or Washington toward a compromise . Instead , Citicorp , Chase Manhattan and other heavily exposed institutions chose to increase their loan-loss reserves , at the cost of this year 's profits , to protect themselves from a Brazilian default . Although financial experts and U.S. bank regulators recognized that the decision was long overdue ( and had already been taken by European banks ) , its effects were limited . For one thing , not all the banks increased their reserves to an amount commensurate with possible losses in Brazil . Manufacturers Hanover , for example , upped its reserves to $1.7 billion although its loans to Brazil total $2.3 billion . Equally important , loan loss reserves for the biggest banks would be wiped out if Brazil defaulted , and many other countries are also teetering on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion debt . The losses sustained by stockholders because of the increase in reserves were staggering . Citicorp showed a net loss of $2.6 billion in revenues in the second quarter of this year , the second highest deficit in U.S. corporate history ( American Telephone and Telegraph 's $4.9 billion loss in one quarter of 1983 holds the record ) . Earnings for the industry 's biggest banks fell 16 percent in the same period , and yearend profits are expected to be the lowest since 1934 . Since 1982 , when Mexico defaulted , the developing nations have been warning the industrialized nations of global financial storms if an agreement between creditors and debtors is not achieved . Contrary to earlier claims by bankers that the crisis would soon pass , statistics from the International Monetary Fund and other financial organizations show that the problem has become insoluble  --  like a debt to the company store . Because of the fear of defaults , private lending to the developed countries has slowed to a trickle , with the result that the poorer countries are being forced to transfer scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net flow of $22.1 billion from Latin America to foreign creditors during 1986 because of debt repayment . Between 1983 and 1986 Brazil paid $33 billion more to the banks than it received in loans , but by early 1987 the government was running out of money  --  hence the dramatic announcement of a suspension of interest payments . * The cost of decapitalization can be seen throughout the region  --  in the sharp increase in such diseases as tuberculosis and malaria that had nearly been eliminated in some Latin American countries a decade ago ; in the armies of ? Earlier this month , Brazil 's foreign creditors announced that they had come up with a short-term solution by lending Brazil $1 billion to enable it to pay back this year 's interest . But the arrangement is solely for cosmetic purposes and will do nothing to relieve the hard-pressed Brazilian economy . hungry beggars who throng the city streets ; and in the bankruptcy of countless industries , banks and farms . According to the World Bank , per capita income in Latin America has dropped about 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930s . As President Garcia observes , foreign loans have impoverished the region . Despite repayments that average 35 percent of Latin America 's export earnings , the debt continues to grow exponentially because of interest rates : By the end of this year Latin America will account for $421 billion of the Third World 's $1.2 trillion debt . Obviously the situation can not continue , even if U.S. bankers and government officials choose to hide their heads in the sand . During the annual meeting of the I.M.F . and the World Bank in Washington September 29-October 1 , the latter insisted that there is no reason to change the rules of the game . " It 's a dialogue of the deaf , " admitted one Latin American official . One reason the bankers are able to ignore Third World pleas for a new approach to foreign debt is that the developing countries are themselves divided . Even the Latin Americans , who have the longest experience of regional consultation on the matter , have been unable to form a common front , primarily because of the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered an opportunity to pressure U.S. banks to change their policies , Brazilian President Jose Sarney was too weak an administrator to seize the initiative ; other heads of state tried to capitalize on Brazil 's misfortune by making their own deals with foreign bankers . But while the bankers may be able to buy time , by lowering interest rates here and stretching out payments there , a string of defaults looks increasingly likely . Regional economists do not foresee a " big bang " but a continuing slide down the black hole , much like what occurred in the 1930s when one country after another stopped paying . As bankers themselves admit , the market does n't lie . Resale of Latin American debt in a flourishing new secondary financial market has the real value of such paper ranging between 25 and 95 percent less than that shown on the banks ' books ( 90 percent for Bolivia , 60 percent for Brazil , 50 percent for Venezuela ) . The banks ' resale of such debt at substantial discounts is acknowledgment that the debt will not be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to pay interest on the full value of their loans . It also supports the Latin Americans ' argument that a high percentage of the foreign debt is unreal  --  money they never received but which was tacked onto their original debt because of the sharp increase in interest rates in the United States at the end of the Carter Administration . Discounts on the Latin American debt " do not reflect bank losses so much as a reduction in the exorbitant profits made . . . on an overvalued debt , " said Colombian economist Carlos Rodado Noriega . In a new menu of alternatives offered to debtor countries , the trade of discounted debt paper  --  or " debt-equity swaps " ? is the hottest item because it supposedly offers something for everyone see Wayne Curtis , " Here Comes the Repo Man , " The Nation , May 2 . Typically the buyer of the paper is a multinational corporation which swaps it for local currency at the debtor nation 's central bank in order to invest locally . The foreign bank gets some of its money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the debtor country , a cancellation in local currency of a discounted portion of its foreign debt . But the scheme has several flaws . Economic experts say that it is applicable only in limited cases . In Latin America , which is the pilot model , debt-equity swaps may total $4 billion this year , or 1 percent of the foreign debt , as balanced against the outflow of $30 billion for debt payments . Swaps could also prove inflationary , by encouraging governments to print more money to buy back the debt in local currencies , as well as an additional drain on the economy , through increased foreign profit remittances from an expanded investment base . But undoubtedly the greatest drawback to such swaps is that they are another variation of the old shell game , in which Latin America gives over control of its industries , banks and farms to foreign interests . Instead of attracting new foreign investment to increase jobs and productive capacity , swaps enable multinational corporations and banks to absorb existing Latin American assets . Much the same occurred during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the takeover of Latin American industry and agriculture by U.S companies . Meanwhile , the banks will continue to drain the region of local capital through debt repayment . Citicorp , for example , which in 1985 earned 2 percent of its worldwide profits of almost $1 billion from Brazil , has $4.4 billion invested in the country , making it the largest foreign investor . The U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board strongly support the swap scheme as a means of reducing financial pressure on U.S. banks while postponing the day when the United States must put its own house in order . As European bankers have long known , and as Latin American economists are beginning to realize , the United States has been living on the capital of the rest of the world , primarily the developing countries , thanks to the international role of the dollar . Able to print a currency used by other countries as a medium of payment , the United States flooded the world 's money markets in the wake of the Vietnam War in order to finance a growing foreign debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the oil crisis of 1973 , which was actually a response to it  --  that caused U.S. and European banks to offload dollars through mammoth loans at extremely low interest rates to the developing countries . Some of the biggest borrowers , such as Mexico and , to a lesser extent , Argentina , were oil producers themselves and did not need the money to finance oil imports . They took it because of strong encouragement from the banks , which led the borrowers to believe that financial conditions would not change appreciably . But when the dollar weakened in 1979-1980 because of growing budget deficits , Washington sharply increased interest rates , thereby sucking in new capital and causing havoc in the indebted Third World . And when the developing countries ran out of money , U.S. banks lent them more dollars in order to repay themselves . " Robbery " is how Latin American economists and government officials describe the decapitahzation of their countries by the world 's most affluent nation . Whether a reckoning is at hand depends on factors outside the Latin Americans ' control  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrialized powers . But so long as Reagan remains in the White House , the likelihood of a bold initiative seems improbable , as shown by his lackadaisical attitude toward the stock market collapse . Bank stocks , already hurt by shareholders ' fears of Third World defaults , took a beating during the Wall Street frenzy , and the prospects for new stock issues are hardly promising . The outlook in Latin America is no less bleak . U.S. bank loans that were in the pipeline have been suspended due to the financial panic , and because the region 's economy is dependent on the dollar , the cost of repaying European and Japanese banks their portion of the debt has increased with the dollar 's fall . Even with the added stress , Latin America 's governments appear unlikely to form a united front . Under President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado , Mexico has steered clear of a regional commitment , preferring to make its own deals with the bankers . De la Madrid 's handpicked successor , economist Carlos Salinas de Gortari , is not expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 presidential election is virtually assured . The governments of Brazil and Argentina , the other major debtors , are too preoccupied with domestic economic and political troubles to take on regional leadership . Colombia , Peru and Chile lack the political clout and will to attempt to fill their shoes . Former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez , the front-runner in his country 's upcoming election , is a strong proponent of a Latin American consensus on debt repayment , but without the support of the major debtors , he is crying in the wind . And although economic conditions have steadily worsened , a popular uprising against the foreign bankers is not in the cards . The people 's anger has instead been directed toward elected leaders , such as Argentine President Raid Alfonsin , who have lost much of their original popularity because of a failure to achieve economic reform . Most ominously , some Latin American political analysts are warning of a swing of the pendulum back to the bankers ' darlings in the military , who were responsible for their countries ' indebtedness in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fidel Castro recently observed in regard to his own country 's indebtedness to the Soviet Union , the only solution is to stop paying . ?
