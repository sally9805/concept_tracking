Because of this concern , the Reagan Administration has begun greatly expanding a program to protect radio stations , has started a research program to determine whether steps can be taken to prevent the disruption of electrical power and has built a backup emergency phone system for the military. // " With the increasing computerization of our society , this is a very real problem that I believe the American people should be aware of , " said George A. Keyworth 2d , the White House science adviser. // The invisible force , which some experts say could possibly be released in a limited nuclear war , would upset the vast electronic networks that have become so essential to the functioning of the nation ' s public and private operations . The force - called EMP , for electromagnetic pulse - would disrupt banks , telephones , electric utilities and vast Government agencies such as the Social Security Administration , the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Internal Revenue Service. // All nuclear explosions create EMP , although the pulse dissipates rapidly in explosions close to the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detonated above the earth ' s atmosphere , there would be no blast , shock , heat or roar - only an invisible , speeding electromagnetic pulse . At this high altitude , gamma rays and X-rays produced by the blast shoot though space and spread out over an extraordinarily wide area . Scientists estimate that one 10-megaton burst 300 miles above the center of the United States would create an intense burst of EMP capable of blanketing the entire country with a pulse that would put 50 , 000 volts into every meter of antenna . Metal objects such as power and telephone lines would pick up the jolt of electricity and deliver it to computers and communication centers , where delicate silicon chips would be knocked out of action. // While military planners have worried about EMP for many years , its potential impact on the civilian economy has been given little consideration until recently . An example of this new concern was a statement issued last month by the Department of Energy warning that such an explosion could seriously disrupt virtually every aspect of American life because the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major disturbances. " // Edward Teller , the pioneer nuclear scientist , has also warned about the far-reaching impact of EMP . " Civilians should remember that their electronic watches might be destroyed , television sets might become inoperable , cars with electronic ignition might stop functioning , and almost every big industry with electronic components would be affected , " he said last year. // The Pentagon first recognized that EMP was a significant force in 1962 when the United States exploded an experimental hydrogen bomb 248 miles above the Pacific Ocean . A split second later , 800 miles away in Hawaii , street lights failed , burglar alarms started ringing and circuit breakers popped open in power lines. // But EMP has become a growing concern in the last few years because the rapid computerization of almost every aspect of military and civilian life in this country has left the nation extraordinarily vulnerable to its power. // Most of the nation ' s banks could not operate without the complex electronic network operated by the Federal Reserve . The Internal Revenue Service could not collect taxes without its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third national communications system that is used by Federal , state and local criminal justice agencies all over the country to exchange information about wanted persons and stolen property . Several privately owned companies have developed computerized systems to provide local merchants almost instantaneous information about the credit worthiness of millions of Americans . <> <> Effect of Testing Ban // Because of the ban on atmospheric testing , EMP experiments are hard to conduct because they must be simulated . Further compounding the difficulty of predicting the precise effects of EMP , experts say , are the different technical characteristics of the various large computerized networks. // Donald C. Latham , Deputy Under Secretary for Communications , Command , Control and Intelligence in the Defense Department , reflected this uncertainty in an interview : " The Bell System , for example , has subjected several of its switches to experimental jolts and they sailed through the tests with only a couple of minor glitches . But that ' s not to say we know that the national telephone system would survive a burst. " // Another reason for the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter and Reagan Administrations of a nuclear strategy that includes the possibility that this country might have to wage a " prolonged , limited nuclear war. " // For a nation to conduct such a war , military analysts stress , much would depend on its ability to organize an effective civil defense that would enable a large part of the population to continue to house and feed itself. // Many experts question the likelihood that any nuclear war would be limited to the exchange of a handful of nuclear explosions . " My personal feeling is that if an attack ever came it would be a massive one on our cities and military bases and the effect of EMP on the civilian economy would be irrelevant , " said Dr. Gordon K. Soper , a senior scientist in the Defense Nuclear Agency . " But there has been a good deal of talk about the possibility of a protracted nuclear war . " Mr. Latham , the Pentagon official , expressed the same kind of ambivalence . " I don ' t think a cheap shot is likely , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The possibility of using EMP as a oneshot weapon is not considered likely because of impossibility of predicting the exact response. // But the Reagan Administration is worried enough about such a possibility to be spending close to $100 million a year on programs , some classified , related to protecting military weapons and communication lines against the effects of EMP , and on conducting research on how this little-understood phenomenon affects various kinds of equipment. // The Administration has also begun to increase spending on several limited programs intended to protect several of the communications and power systems so vital to the civilian economy . It is under these programs that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has requested $3. 7 million for a program to increase the ability of radio stations that would broadcast emergency warnings to withstand the effects of EMP and fallout . This is more than double what the agency is now spending on the same project . Agency officials said 125 of the 2 , 771 stations in the emergency communications network had so far been hardened to withstand EMP at an average cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Against EMP // There are a number of complementary technical strategies to protect electrical equipment against EMP . One is to build a thin metal shield around sensitive installations . Known as a Faraday cage , this shield acts as an antenna to soak up and remove EMP energy that would otherwise knock out the equipment . A highly experienced engineer who asked not to be identified said this method had been adopted to protect some of the nation ' s most important intelligence computers and communication centers . Another strategy is to replace traditional copper lines with fiber optics , a communication technique that is resistant to EMP because the pulse passes right through the thin glass threads that make up fiber optic lines. // Another example of the Government ' s new concern about the effects of EMP on the civilian economy is its recent decision to finance a research program to better protect electrical utilities against EMP . Nearly 80 percent of the nation ' s electrical industry relies on delicate computers for the orchestration of power production . The initial phase of the protection research is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be created by high altitude EMP has national security implications , " the Energy Department said in a statement explaining why it had started the new research program . " During a period of national crisis , electrical power will be required to operate military installations , civil defense facilities and critical industries . In addition , if EMP caused a disruption of the financial , manufacturing , retail , transportation and communication industries , as well as basic utilities , serious economic and social consequences would result . Disruption of the nation ' s electrical power supply has grave implications. " // In an article in Spectrum , the authoritative magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , Eric J. Lemer , a contributing editor , expressed similar concerns . <> <> Power Grid ' s Vulnerability // " The potential impact on the national power grid of a small number of high altitude EMP bursts would be comparable to that produced by large lightning bolts hitting every power line segment in the country , " he said . " When it is considered that two ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City blackout , it is easy to see why many analysts believe that a complete shutdown of the national power grid could be achieved by a handful of EMP detonations. " // Robert Gradle , a vice president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company , is somewhat less concerned about the effects of EMP on the telephone system. // " We live in an age when information transfer has become very important , " he said . " Some say it now represents 50 percent of the gross national product . But I don ' t share the doomsday approach that things can ' t be made to work . Without enormous expense , however , we can ' t fix the existing plant and be 100 percent positive everything is going to work. " // Mr. Gradle and other experts say that improving existing systems to resist EMP might cost almost as much as building the original equipment . New equipment capable of resisting EMP , however , would probably cost only 2 or 3 percent more than new equipment without such an ability , Mr. Gradle said. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
