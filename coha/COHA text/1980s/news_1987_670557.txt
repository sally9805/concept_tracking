But playing golf with the former Speaker of the House involves more conversation than golf , and in a recent round at the Eastward Ho country club in Chatham , Mass. , on a peninsula jutting into Pleasant Bay , he discussed the 1988 Presidential campaign , Presidents he has known and reminiscences of his early days in politics. // Former Representative Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. , 74 years old , who retired this year to his vacation home on Cape Cod , said that his 50 years in public life left him so low in funds that he had only $2 , 900 in the bank when he signed a $1 million contract to write his memoirs , " Man of the House . " The book , written with William Novak , is reaching the stores now , and Mr. O ' Neill is preparing for a six-week publicity tour. // Unlike some former members of Congress who return to Capitol Hill as lobbyists , Mr. O ' Neill has stayed away . In what looks like a blitz , he has been featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hush Puppies. // Although he misses the excitement of politics , his Harwichport home has become a way station for Washingtonians , recently including former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and a lobbyist friend , Anne Wexler , and her husband , Joseph Duffy . <> <> No Papers , No Lunch // Mr. O ' Neill says that his wife , Millie , canceled home delivery of his newspapers , forcing him to get dressed in the morning and drive to the newsstand . " I haven ' t made lunch for you in 40 years , and I ' m not about to start now , " he recalled her saying. // Between his easy swings on a golf course surrounded by water , with sailboats gliding past the greens , Mr. O ' Neill talked about Presidential politics . In his view , the emerging leader for the Democratic nomination is Gov . Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts . Mr. Dukakis ' s popularity persuaded Mr. O ' Neill ' s son , Tom , then the Lieutenant Governor , to bow out of the Democratic gubernatorial race in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with Mr. Dukakis , but a lifetime of loyalty to local politicians obviously dictated his support for the Governor. // The former Speaker also said he had great affection and respect for another contender , Senator Paul Simon of Illinois , whom he called " the only liberal in the race . " The strongest Republican contender , in Mr. O ' Neill ' s view , is Senator Bob Dole of Kansas . He respects Mr. Dole as a professional politician who knows how to strike compromises , and as a rural conservative who nonetheless supported civil rights measures and domestic programs that helped the poor . But his barbed wit also makes him the likeliest candidate to self-destruct , Mr. O ' Neill said. // Noting the intense scrutiny that Presidential aspirants receive today , Mr. O ' Neill recalled being amazed to discover , on a White House visit in 1934 , that President Roosevelt was disabled , a fact that had gone virtually unreported by the press. // He also contrasted the disclosure required by the campaign finance laws of today with the casual , cash-and-carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House in 1952 . In those days , Mr. O ' Neill recalled , lobbyists would place cash in a box kept in the office of Speaker Sam Rayburn , who would then hand over the money to Congressmen running for re-election. // Of all the Presidents he has known , Mr. O ' Neill said , he has the least respect for Ronald Reagan. // This comes through clearly in his salty , anecdotal book. which he regards as his political testament . The former Speaker wrote : " Ronald Reagan lacked the knowledge he should have had in every sphere , both domestic and international . Most of the time he was an actor reading lines , who didn ' t understand his own programs. " // " I hate to say it about such an agreeable man , " Mr. O ' Neill wrote. " but it was sinful that Ronald Reagan ever became President. " // He wrote that although Mr. Reagan " wasn ' t without leadership ability , " he lacked the fundamental management skills that a President needs . " But let me give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a king. " // The former Speaker also wrote that Mr. Reagan had been much more seriously wounded than was reported in the 1981 assassination attempt . Upon visiting the stricken President in the hospital , " I was shocked by his condition . This was three days after the shooting , and he was clearly exhausted and in pain. " // " I suspect that in the first day or two after the shooting , he was probably closer to death than most of us realized , " Mr. O ' Neill wrote . " If he hadn ' t been so strong and hardy , it could have been all over. " // On another topic , he portrays the 1983 invasion of Grenada as an attempt by the Reagan Administration to divert attention from the terrorist explosion that killed 241 American military personnel in Lebanon. // " It was all because the White House wanted the country to forget about the tragedy in Beirut , " Mr. O ' Neill wrote . " My greatest fear about Reagan ' s foreign policy , " he continued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back on the Grenada incident as a dress rehearsal for our invasion of Nicaragua. " // The former Speaker , who has always said that " all politics is local , " reported that the maxim holds true in China . At a meeting in Peking with Deng Xiaoping , Mr. O ' Neill said , he asked the Chinese leader : " Why are you always talking about Taiwan ? Here ' s a little island of less than 20 million people . The way I figure it , Taiwan should mean nothing to you. " // " You ' re absolutely right , " Mr. Deng replied . " But just between us , it ' s something our people love to hear about , and that ' s why I keep harping on it. " // At a meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev , Mr. O ' Neill wrote , the Soviet leader spoke English . " But as soon as we started meeting officially , he spoke only Russian . Even so , he interrupted the interpreter on several occasions when he didn ' t think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // As for Jimmy Carter , Mr. O ' Neill wrote that when the man from Plains , Ga. , entered the White House , his greatest political achievement was already behind him : " He got himself elected as an outsider , but once he got to Washington , he had to deal with other national politicians . " <> <> Intermediary for the Kennedys // In his book , Mr. O ' Neill tells of acting as an intermediary in 1962 in the Kennedys ' unsuccessful effort to persuade Edward McCormack , nephew of Speaker John McCormack , to withdraw from the Democratic primary in which he was opposing Edward M. Kennedy ' s initial campaign for the Senate . Mr. O ' Neill wrote that he passed along the following offer from Kenneth O ' Donnell , a Kennedy aide. // " Tell the Speaker that if Eddie drops out , we ' ll make him an ambassador to any country he wants . We also understand that he ' s in debt for a hundred thousand dollars . If he gets out now , old Joe Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Eddie will be retained as a lawyer for some of the Kennedy ventures. " // Asked today if the offer constituted an attempted bribe , Mr. O ' Neill replied , " That ' s how politics was conducted in those days. " // His memoir is already being challenged . He wrote , for example , that after he announced his support for Geraldine Ferraro as the Democrats ' Vice-Presidential candidate in 1984 , " several of the other women in the House , including Lindy Boggs of Louisiana , Patricia Schroeder of Colorado and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland , were upset with me for not endorsing them. " // Ms. Mikulski , now a Senator , disputed that . " I was one of Geraldine ' s strongest advocates , " she said . " I endorsed her on national television and indeed led the delegation of Congresswomen to get Mondale to choose her . I think Tip has a memoirs mixup . " Back at the course , at lunch near the 18th green , Mr. O ' Neill said he looked forward to his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charity golf tournaments around the country. //
