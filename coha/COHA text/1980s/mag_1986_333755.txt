The President 's image had barely faded from the TV screens when he admitted that he had been wrong on one important point . Three times during his Wednesday-night news conference Ronald Reagan had denied approving arms shipments by any other country to Iran , even after reporters reminded him that his staff had revealed that the U.S. had condoned at least one such shipment , by Israel in August 1985 . Yet almost as soon as the President was off-camera , aides told him he had erred . Within 15 minutes the White House press office rushed out a statement in Reagan 's name contending lamely , " There may be some misunderstanding of one of my answers tonight . There was a third country involved in our secret project with Iran . " <P> The snafu was symbolic as well as substantive : it showed an Administration floundering and failing in its attempts to restore its credibility . In their efforts to explain and justify the secret U.S. sales of weapons and spare parts to Iran  --  which shattered the entire foundation of the Administration 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Reagan and his aides last week seemed only to be erecting a Tower of Babel abuzz with conflicting and contradictory voices . Presidential confidants past and present got into a public squabble : former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane , one of the architects of the President 's Iranian policy , called the arms transfers a " mistake , " and was promptly accused by Chief of Staff Donald Regan of giving " lousy advice . " The President and his Secretary of State , George Shultz , apparently unwilling to settle anything face to face , took to exchanging messages by way of television . And by the end of the week an ABC News poll showed not only that 59% of the public disbelieved Reagan 's answers but that his overall approval rating had fallen 10 points in the past two months , to 57% , the lowest since May 1985 in the wake of his visit to West Germany 's Bitburg Cemetery . <P> Joining the fray from Iran , the Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini appeared to squelch one of Reagan 's last chances to salvage something from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan announced at his news conference that there would be no more arms deliveries , he expressed a rather wan hope that the U.S. could stay in sympathetic touch with so-called moderates in Khomeini 's government . That , the 86-year-old Ayatullah quickly &; made clear , would happen only over his dead body . Speaking with his old-time pungency , Khomeini implied that those Iranians who had been dealing with the " Black House " were " Satan-oriented , " and cried , " May God get rid of the insurgents in this country ! " <P> Closed-door briefings of the Senate and House intelligence committees by Administration officials on Friday did little to allay congressional skepticism about the White House policy toward Iran . " I ca n't believe what I heard , and I do n't , " said New York Democratic Senator Daniel Moynihan after a briefing by CIA Director William Casey . " It 's hard to believe that such things are planned . "
