Bulls by nature are sprinters who tire quickly . But the breed on Wall Street is displaying the endurance of a marathon runner . The stock-market rally that began more than three years ago is as robust as ever . The stampede , spurred at first by a sharp drop in interest rates , started on Friday , Aug. 13 , 1982 , with a twelve-point rise in the closely watched Dow Jones industrial average , to 788 . The runaway Dow took only six months to close above the 1100 mark for the first time ever and just two more to break 1200 . Though the market slowed to a more dawdling pace for more than a year , it came roaring back again last spring . The Dow zipped past 1300 in May , and last week it made history again by crashing through the 1400 barrier . It ended the week at 1404 , up 14 . <P> Even though the U.S. economy is trudging along at a slow 3% annual growth rate , investors see plenty of reasons for putting their money on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker hinted last month that the central bank will continue to apply downward pressure on rates in order to keep the economy moving .

But last week the dollar continued to fall sharply against Japan 's currency , dipping to a value of 203 yen in Tokyo , the lowest closing level since February 1981 . The decline is already showing some concrete results . Japan 's Sony announced last week that it plans to raise its U.S. prices by 5% to 12% on everything from TV sets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms to compete with Sony , but it is unlikely to leave consumers happy . <P> Amid Wall Street 's glee , though , some investors are sounding alarms . They point out that a large part of the stock-market gain has been caused by the boom in mergers and leveraged buyouts . The massive stock purchases involved in those deals push up prices in general , but the buying is financed by huge loans that could shake the banking system if they go sour . Says Robert Salomon , director of stock research at the Salomon Bros , investment firm : " All this takeover activity is fine and dandy , but let 's not forget that we are swapping equity for massive amounts of debt . Some of these highly leveraged companies could find it difficult somewhere down the line . " A few analysts think they see the kind of borrowing-and-buying frenzy that could cause a serious plunge in the next few years .
