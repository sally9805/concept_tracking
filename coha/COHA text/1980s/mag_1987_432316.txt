 | Betty Ford was addicted to pills and alcohol , but she did n't know it until April 1 , 1978 , when her husband and children confronted her with the shocking truth . From the new book by former First Lady Betty Ford with Chris Chase EDITORS NOTE : In her new book former First Lady Betty Ford courageously tells how she won one of life 's hardest battles : overcoming alcoholism and pill addiction . Tracing the history of her disease , she reveals that both her father and her brother were alcoholics and that alcohol contributed to the breakup of her first marriage . Social drinking had played a role in Mrs. Ford 's life while she was still a young woman living in Grand Rapids , Mich. , but her dependency on alcohol surfaced only after her second husband , lawyer Gerald Ford , won an election to Congress from Michigan . In Washington , the Fords moved from the high pressure world of politics into the Washington hot seat ? the White House . Mrs. Ford recalls : " I began taking daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills eased my pain as I chased four active little children . My children grew and so did my pill habit . I had a gourmet collection of drugs and when I added vodka to the mix , I moved into a wonderful fuzzy place where everything was fine . and I could cope . " After she left the White House in 1977 . Mrs. Ford 's health gradually deteriorated . Her husband and children became very concerned but did n't know how to help her . Finally , in 1978 , daughter Susan , literally afraid her mother would die . arranged for a family " intervention . " In an intervention , family members and a professional counselor meet with the chemically-dependent person and in an honest , open , but caring way confront the person with facts about his or her behavior and the consequences of that behavior on not only the addicted one . but on the entire family . Hopefully such an intervention will lead the addicted person to seek help . The following excerpt from Mrs. Ford 's book begins with the Ford family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Susan ? coming together in an urgent attempt to save Betty Ford 's life . April 1 , 1978 . I was dying and everyone knew it but me . I sat on the couch in the living room of our Palm Springs house , my husband 's arm around me , and I cried . We were having an intervention , starring me . My husband and my children , Mike , Jack , Steve , and Susan had gathered -- along with two doctors , a nurse , and a couple of friends ? to tell me they were concerned about my failing health , and thought I had a problem with alcohol and drugs . I 'd never heard of an intervention , and I would just as soon have kept it that way . I did not want to hear any of what my family was telling me . My makeup was n't smeared , I was n't disheveled , I behaved politely , so how could I be alcoholic ? And I was n't on heroin or cocaine : the medicines I took ? the sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pills to counteract the side effects of other pills ? had been prescribed by doctors , so how could I be a drug addict ? My self-esteem was nonexistent . I did not understand how much love it took for them to risk this confrontation with me . For months , I had been withdrawing . As I got sicker , I would n't see friends , I was putting everyone out of my life . But so far as my family was concerned , a crisis point had been reached at Christmas 1977 . The children say it was the worst Christmas ever , but I was completely oblivious to their distress . We were at our house in Vail , Colo. , there was a lot of good snow , we were together , and I had my pills . I thought everyone was happy . That was also the week that our children went to Jerry . Mike Ford : " We were in the dark about drug dependency and alcoholism . We just knew Mother was manifesting a lot of unhealthy signs , being incoherent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slurred speech , the not getting dressed until late in the day ,  | had become a life-style . You could tell she was a sick woman . " Susan Ford Vance : " Even earlier , I had talked to Dad . He was as frustrated as I was . It was one of those , ' Well , sweetheart , yolt find the solution and I 'm with you , ' but he did n't know ghat to do either . " Jerry Ford : " Susan had been talking to me about ' Mother 's problem , ' but I guess she was somewhat intimidated by me because she never carne out and said , ' Dad , you 've got to do something . ' " Finally . it was Susan herself who did something . Through the grace of God , I guess , she got involved with helping Dr. Joseph Cruse , our gynecologist ( and a recovering alcoholic ) at Turnoff , a rehabilitation center for chemically dependent kids . Dr. Cruse had hired Susan to take pictures of Turnoff . On their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Vance : " Dr. Cruse said he could help me put an intervention team together . I said , ' Well , let me go back to my dad , because I could n't okay anything without hint . ' " I went back and talked to Dad , and he said , ' That sounds great , ' and then he took off on ct trip . So I called Claret Powell in Washington . Clara had worked for our fancily all the time we kids were growing up and she had been our second mother . I said , ' Clara , you 've got to come out here . Mother is taking pills , and I ca n't stand it anymore . ' She promised she would come . " Joseph Cruse , M.D. : " About a week after my conversation with Susan , I got a call from Bob Barrett , a fanner White House aide who still worked with the Ford family . Barrett had me come over the next night and explain to President Ford what an intervention was . " Joseph Pursch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval hospital and said Mrs. Ford needed to have an intervention . He told me hots notch medication she was on , and I knew she would need to be detoeed slowly , but I thought it could be clone safely in her house . " My nurse and I went to Palm Springs the next day , Friday . There we stet with Clara and Susan before the rest of the family arrived , to fill them in a little . ' We want to present to your mother , lovingly y but firmly , brief facts about two things ? how her illness is affecting and destroying her , and how her illness is affecting and destroying you , ' I said . ' And how , as her daughter and her friend , you can no longer stand by and watch . ' " Then Susan said , ' I 'm afraid my mother will die . ' " 1 said , ' This is what you need to tell her . ' " Mike Ford : " Susan was the one who said we just could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Dad , get your rear end home , Mother is in a bad way . Dad called my wife , Gayle , and me , and said , ' We want to do this right away . Can you , fly out ? ' " He said we all needed to be there to make a unified presentation . " I was scared of Mother 's reaction . But when I began to understand the nature of chemical dependence , and how it had taken over her life , I was prepared to march in and lay it on her . " Steve Ford : " I had n't been around that much . I 'd come visit , but Susan lived in Palm Springs , so she got burned the worst . It 's hard to live with anyone who has a drug or alcohol problem . They do n't think rationally all the time , they do n't act rationally . " We as a family were frustrated with the problem , but we kept avoiding it . We had never given Mom a chance to have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It took us only about 15 minutes in the President 's office to train the fancily for the intervention . Dr. Pursch and I handed them pieces of paper and said , ' Write down some thing your mother did and how you felt about it . ' One of the boys had written that his mother had fallen asleep in front of his friends , and he 'd had to take her upstairs , something like that . And the President listened , really listened , to all of it . " Jerry Ford : " The doctors gave us a set of guidelines we had to follow to make the intervention successful . And they warned the kids in advance , ' Now your mother 's going to get mad , she 's going to cry , but you have to be firm and you ai n't let her intimidate you because that 's what she 's been doing . ' " And that was true . I had turned into an enabler myself . 1 was making it possible for Betty to continue to drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about why we were late getting someplace , or why Betty did n't show up at all . And it was getting worse , not better . " So this intervention was a last chance . I knew I world hate the things 1 had to say , but I was relieved too . I was convinced this was the only way the situation could be turned around . " Joseph Pursch , M.D. : " At the end of our little training session , the President asked , ' Are you sure this needs to be done ? And that she can be helped ? ' I said , ' I 'm positive about the first , and I 'm highly optimistic about the second . ' " ' In that case , ' he said , ' we 'll go . ' " When the whole family trooped into the house . I had no clue what was coming . I thought Mike and Gayle had flown out to visit because I had n't been feeling well . Bob Barrett : " President and Mrs. Ford sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike , Gayle , Jack , Steven , Susan , Clara and the two doctors and the nurse . " Mrs. Ford looked small , almost like a doll , lost in the cushions , and as her husband arcade his opening remarks ? that site was . chemically dependent and the doctors wanted to talk to her ? you could see the confusion in her face . " Jerry said , " Mother , we 've got something to talk to you about , and we want you to listen , because we love you . " I listened , but I did n't hear that they loved me , I heard that I had failed . Steve Ford : " She never failed . I can understand how she could think that , but she never failed as a mother . I only told of one incident that had hurt me ? ( ) fa weekend when Dad was gone , and he did n't want Mon : to be alone , so 1 drove to Palm Springs . I made dinner , I took it into Mom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I really do n't feel like eating , ' and site went and got another drink . " When I told the story , Mom cried . " Jack Ford : " I had n't liked to bring friends home . If somebody came by the house , 1 was always kind of peeking around the corner into the family room to see what kind of shape Mother was in . " Mike Ford : " I told Mother that , being the oldest , 1 thought 1 probably saw more clearly the pressures and demands on her of having been ca wife in Washington , and the mother of four children . But I said she had got to the point now where her life-style was very destructive , and was hurting her relationships with her husband , her family , and her friends . " That Gayle said something that hit really hard . She told Mother that we wanted to start a . family , and we wanted our children to know their grandmother ? but as a healthy , loving person . At that point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living to see her grandchildren , or living in such a miserable state that the grandchildren would be afraid of ' her ? that really knocked her flat . " Susan Ford Vance : " I guess I had been aware that Mother took pills when we were in the White House , but I had n't thought twice about it until much later ? in the spring of 1977 . " Then I really started to see it . Once she fell in the middle of the night and cracked her ribs and chipped her tooth . @#  | " I had started dating Chuck Vance ? he was at that time one of my parents ' Secret Service agents ? and he was with her on different assignments , protecting her . He would come to me later and say , ' Susan , you 've got to do something about your mother ; she 's slowly destroying herself . ' " I remember going to Las Vegas with Mother to see a show . And Chuck and I had to just about carry her upstairs to her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering for her ? and all the while we were thinking : What are we going to do ? " At the intervention , it took me a long time to get any swords out , not just because I was crying , but because Mother was crying so hard . But it was almost healing , for me for once it was Out in the open . " The whole thing was a miracle . It 's a miracle I did n't just not wake up some morning from all the drugs I was taking , and it 's a miracle my family did n't just let me slip away and completely destroy myself . When Steve did that bit about cooking for me ? I thought , that kid has a lot of nerve . I was used to having two drinks before dinner . When Susan came off as the perfect daughter , I felt some resentment about that too . As I look back , I realize I had no comprehension of my disease . My denial was at its peak . and denial is a cornerstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the night I fell and cracked my ribs either . One of my points of pride was that I did n't ever fall down . Could I have been having blackouts from time to time ? Not remembering what had really happened ? Jerry said how slow I was , how tardy . " You were in second gear , " he said . And he said it had become " increasingly difficult to lead a normal life . " He said it used to upset him to watch me get up in the morning and take that handful of pills , and then take another handful at night , on top of a couple of drinks . A lot of the time , he just pretended not to see , his denial of my condition as firmly in place as my own . At the end of the intervention , when everyone had spoken , Dr. Pursch asked me if I was willing to go into treatment , and I said yes , but Bob Barrett claims I did n't sound wholehearted . Before they went to lunch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the doctors told me they 'd be coming back with some friends , and for me to get dressed . Naturally , I was n't dressed , I was in a robe . And they said they would be collecting all my medications and prescriptions and taking them away . I got dressed , and put myself together to prove how really well I was . I also swallowed a bunch of pills . I 'd show them . They were going to confiscate my supply ? I 'd just gulp down the four or five pills I normally took at noon ; I might need them before this day was over . In the afternoon , some people came and showed us how support-group meetings work . They all told about their alcoholism and their recovery and how changed their lives were now . After the group meeting , Dr. Pursch used a blackboard to list every drug I was on . how many milligrams a day of each , and when he added them all up , the amount was staggering . He said over the years I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're confronted with that kind of evidence , you have to be a real dummy not to realize you 're in trouble . Jerry Ford : " My apprehension about the amount of medication had been growing . I never counted the pills , but 1 knew she took cr lot ; I saw the bills from the pharmacy . I was more concerned with the drugs than with the alcohol , because the amounts she was drinking did n't seen : abnormally high . It was a couple of vodkas before dinner , and after dinner , site would want a couple of bourbons . But I did ! not know how the  | combination of alcohol and pills multiplied the impact until Pursch showed us that chart . " Dr. Pursch said that once I was detoxed , there were several treatments to consider , including the program at the rehab unit at nearby Long Beach Naval Hospital . Steve Ford : " Mom was a very scared woman , left naked to say she was addicted . And , in fact , forced to say it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I look back , I see this vision of her shaking . Someone came in and took all the pills front her bathroom and dressing room , all the things she could hide behind . When she first started down the road to recovery , I do n't think she had any idea where it was going . " I did n't , oh , I did n't . That week of detoxification , I shook so much I did n't need an electric toothbrush . And in bed at night , my legs kept moving , I could n't lie still . I kept saying the Serenity Prayer ? " God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change ... " as I struggled through chemical withdrawal . Repeating it seemed to calm me . I think now it was rather chancy for them to try to detox me at home the way they did . I think I should have been in a hospital , and Pat , the nurse who stayed with me , agreed . A week passed . I took my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by slow degrees ? at midnight , Friday , April 7 . On Sunday Pat packed my bag for Long Beach where I would go the next morning . When I got inside the hospital I almost turned right around and walked out . Because there in the hall was this huge sign that read , " Alcohol Rehabilitation Center . " I was not ready for that . I had a pill problem . that was my position ? do n't make it sound worse than it is . I was not a model patient at Long Beach . I considered myself a very special person who had been married to a President of the United States , and I did n't think I should have to discuss my personal problems with just anybody . So group therapy was difficult for me . I related to the feelings others were expressing , but I could n't let anyone know I felt that way . And I still could not say I was alcoholic . It was in my second week at Long Beach that I was finally shocked into admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened at a family session where a young woman got up and said she did n't know why her family was making such a big deal about her drinking . " My drinking has n't caused my folks any trouble , " this girl said . And I was well aware that her drinking had caused her folks a lot of trouble . It was my turn  | to speak next and suddenly I was on my feet , and I said , " I 'm Betty , and I 'm an alcoholic . " Because I thought , if she is n't gutsy enough to say it , I will ! It surprised me to hear myself and yet it was a relief . While I was at Long Beach my husband , Steve and Susan took some family therapy there : Susan Ford Vance : " One morning , Pete , my counselor , read us a short story titled ' Warm Frizzles . ' It was about how somebody took a warm fuzzy away . from somebody . Well , it was like taking my heart and pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother , and how she had taken everything away from me . I had never had a chance to be a kid : I was always covering for her . And Pete said , ' Hey , guys , Susan is asking for help . ' And then everybody started talking and it was fine . It really made me feel so much better . " Jerry Ford : " I went to three or four AA meetings with Betty . For the first time I learned about alcoholism . I learned that I was making all these excuses an enabler does . " When you have four weeks in a recovery program , your first goal is sobriety . And then you have to find reasons to stay sober . The body recovers first . As I became freer of the drugs , even my skin began to tingle . Just as the emotions I had medicated away came alive too . But treatment is just that first good swift kick in the pants that 's supposed to get you back on the track a little bit . True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your emotions so they do n't get you in trouble . I was a long way from there , when after the fourweek program at Long Beach , I went home . But I was sober , and I was beginning to eat right , and exercise . And I was beginning to be happy again . I had to prepare myself for reality . There would be dips in that happiness . Sometimes , at night , I would get into bed , and when my husband put his arms around me , I would dissolve . " I just do n't understand how I could have done this to you and the children . I 'm so ashamed . " Jerry would be very calm , and say he was grateful that 1 was recovering , and that alcoholism was a disease , it was n't something I 'd tried to go out and get . That first year of recovery was confusing . There was joy . there was terror , there was denial . Sometimes I 'd go through all of them in a few hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to give a dinner party at the Pierre Hotel in New York for Fred Silverman , who was then the president of NBC . I was beside myself with anxiety . A pitcherful of martinis had been  | delivered to our room . There it was on the service cart . It was a huge pitcher , and I knew if I took just a little bathroom glass and poured until it was about a third full , the liquor would never be missed . And I would be calm and cool and able to greet our important guests . No one would ever know . But I would know . I did n't drink the martini . And the evening went beautifully . I realized I could do it without my old crutch . The growth of something like that is the growth of sobriety . There was other growth in our family . In September 1978 , our daughter-in-law Gayle told us she was pregnant , and we rejoiced that we were going to have a grandchild . At Thanksgiving Susan issued a bulletin : She and Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not thrilled , and one of my greatest regrets is that we showed it . Susan was only 21 , Chuck a divorced man with adopted children , and while we said we would support their decision , we also said we thought they ought to wait a while . Susan was our youngest child , our only girl , and we did n't think anybody was good enough for her . Susan Ford Vance : " There was no fondness there , between my mother and Chuck . Even after we were married , she mould say , ' Well , if things are n't going okay , honey , you can come home anytime . ' And that really irritated me , that she had no confidence in my choice . I guess probably after about two years of my marriage , my parents finally gave in . The wedding and the few days right before the wedding are a jumble in my head . We got through the rehearsal , and the rehearsal dinner , and the wedding itself , and the reception , replete with dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , contends that I was not so merry as some of the others . Steve Ford : " The reception was very hard for Mont . I 'm sure she wanted to have a drink . I sat in the living room with her and held her hand . " Susan Ford Vance : " The wedding , I think , was very hard on her . She told friends of mine that until the moment I walked down the aisle she never expected me to do it .... " Everything had been moving so fast , and I was upset about losing our only daughter . Then there were lunches and parties , and a lot of television shots because there was interest in my autobiography , which had just been published . Maybe it was all too much too soon . Because in the spring of 1979 , 1 fell into a depression . @# " I seem to be in a cycle of negative thinking , " I wrote in a notebook . " Why ? My health is good , I 'm a brandnew grandmother ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what more can I ask ? Maybe I need a new challenge . " Then , shortly after my sixty-first birthday , a new challenge came my way . My friend Leonard Firestone called me up in great excitement . Walter Annenberg , who is trustee emeritus of the Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Springs , had suggested that Leonard and I put our heads together and come up with a plan for starting an alcoholic and drug rehabilitation center at Eisenhower . We did , and in the next three years , Leonard and I were out collecting money to start a center : friends saw us coming with our hands out and sighed deeply . By the third anniversary of my sobriety , we had three million dollars . Somewhere in the middle of the process , Leonard and Joe Cruse convinced me that it would be beneficial to our cause if we called the new facility the Betty Ford Center . What 's more , they made me president of the board . I love the work , and it gives me a chance to lord it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're just a former president , I am an acting president . " It was a hectic sobriety I was going through while the center was being built . When Leonard and I were not on the road drumming up funds , I was traveling with Jerry . In 1980 we went to Detroit for the Republican convention . In Detroit I said a lot of prayers because it looked as though Jerry might be talked into running with Reagan . I knew I should not try to force on him my feelings of not wanting to go back to Washington . But when I thought of leaving behind the Betty Ford Center , with our work so newly started ... . Jerry Ford : In 1979 , there had been a lot of support for my going after the Republican presidential nomination . I looked at the pluses and minuses ? and it just made more sense not to get into it . " Betty 's recovery was never talked about , but if I had run for President or Vice President ? and in the process it had interfered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : So even though it was not discussed , it was a factor . " I was relieved . My new life in recovery was precious to me and I was glad to be done with politics . On October 3 , 1982 , we held our dedication ceremonies for the Betty Ford Center . We opened our doors the following morning . About a year after I quit drinking , Jerry stopped too . He came home from a plane trip one night , and I said , " A nightcap will relax you . Let me make  | you one . " And he said , " No , thanks . " " Come on , " I said . " It will make you feel so much better , and I really do n't mind . " He said no . " I do n't want one . " I was puzzled . We always used to have a nightcap before we went to bed . " " Yeah , " he said . " And I always hated it . " I was even more puzzled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because , " he said , " I did n't want you to drink alone . " About two years into my sobriety , my husband gave me a piggy bank for Mother 's Day . A note stuck out of the slot . It read , " This is my Mother 's Day recognition for my First Lady . " And inside the note , there was a check to the center . The pig and the note are still on my desk . They show the kind of support I 've had . In recovery , you begin to belong again , you come out of the isolation where you lived with ? and for ? your particular drug . Jack Ford : " I feel closer to Mother . I think , also , her recovery taught us a great lesson , that nothing is hopeless , that you can face up to whatever bad thing happens in your life . " Mike Ford : " I 'm overcome by the changes in my mother . In her alcoholism , she was very self-centered . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in our lives . " Steve Ford : " I ca n't imagine trying to run our family the wary we used to , knowing how wonderful it is now . " After my parents got married , Dad expected to serve the country , and I think he expected Mom to raise his family , and it all went fine for ct long , long time . " But when Dad became a leader in the House of Representatives , and Mother started developing a problem with drinking and the prescriptions , it got real complicated . Because Dad did n't look back . He kept going and Mother sort of got left by the wayside , not because he did n't love her , but because he did n't understand . The wonderful thing is that he finally came back and got her .. . To me , theirs is a wonderful love story . " Not only do my children like me better since my recovery , my husband and I have never been so close either . Which is a paradox , since we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was running all the time . Now we 're both running . He 's always called me every day from wherever he 's been . He 's a very thoughtful man . But as I have grown in my recovery , so has he . In the early days , he could never tell me he loved me . He was too much the lawyer , so programmed and efficient . I had to know in my heart how much he cared , because the words just were n't there . Now it just knocks me for a loop that he 's learned to express his feelings . He calls me from halfway around the world to say , " i just want to tell you that I love you and I miss you . " Jerry Ford : " Betty has always been talented . But the challenge of the center brought out special skills that had been hidden . She not only raised most of the money , but she is a hands-on chairman of the board . " And she is a much more meaningful partner on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to do this or this , ' she wants to know why , she asks tough questions . It 's a more equal relationship than it used to be . " Susan Ford Vance : " I saw a change in her immediately , and at first , I did n't like it at all . All of a sudden she was aware , all of a sudden it was ' Where are you going ? With whom ? ' And I thought , You never paid attention before , why should you start paring attention now ? ' " Now it 's fine . We can be honest with each other and not hurt each other . " Looking back now , I do n't think my husband or the boys ever had the re sentments Susan had . She was the one who rescued me , but she was also the one who most felt the hurt of my illness ? beginning when she was little and did n't know what was wrong with me because I was so emotionally drained and upset . She did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she did n't want a crazy mother . Alcoholism is a family disease . During the four to six weeks that a patient is in treatment at the Betty Ford Center , we ask family members to spend five days there too . We families who get help in time to fix things are the ones who have been blessed . I remember Mike and Gayle at my intervention saying they wanted a healthy grandmother for their children . I have five grandchildren now . Susan and Chuck have two little girls , Mike and Gayle have three . " The healing of a family , " Susan called it . It can be a chain reaction . Wellness spreading from one to another . Like the invisible worm that eats at the heart of the rose , drugs and alcohol are dark , secret lovers that destroy . But it was n't until 1955 that the American Medical Association finally said that alcoholism is a disease . Not that this was accepted with wild acclaim by the entire medical establishment . Too many doctors still contribute to addiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't dispense alcohol , they do write prescriptions ? mostly for women . In all my years in Washington , no doctor ever specifically made a reference to my misuse or abuse of alcohol . And I never made any connection between drinking and a health problem . I had a gourmet collection of drugs ? if one pill is good , two must be better ? and when I added vodka to the mix , I moved into a wonderful fuzzy place where everything was fine , and I could cope . There was enough blame for all of us , the doctors and me . In 1985 the whole family went up to Vail for Christmas week . It was the best Christmas we ever had , and I keep contrasting it with the eight years earlier when the children were pussyfooting around and whispering to each other in corners about what they were going to do with me , their alcoholic parent .
