Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte , 59 , was jubilant . His center-left Christian Democratic Party had surprised even itself last week by its triumph in nationwide legislative and municipal elections . Some 1 million voters , about 59% of those eligible , ignored threats and a few minor attacks by leftist guerrillas to take part in the Palm Sunday voting . When it was over , there had been a clear shift in the country 's balance of political power : the Christian Democrats appeared certain of a definite majority of seats in the 60member National Assembly . The sweeping show of support gave a badly needed boost to Duarte 's reformist government ; it also brought fresh hope to his bold but so far frustrated effort to find a negotiated solution to El Salvador 's more than five-year-old civil war . <P> The full extent of the Christian Democratic victory will not be known until the official vote counting is completed this week . Based on unofficial exit &; polls , however , Duarte 's party appeared to have won 54% of the votes cast  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 in the previous Assembly . An estimated 37% of the ballots went to a coalition formed by the extreme right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance ( ARENA ) , led by Duarte 's nemesis , former Army Major Roberto d'Aubuisson , and the center-right National Conciliation Party . The rightist grouping is expected to take 22 to 25 seats ; it previously held 33 . The remaining seats will probably go to centrist and center-right splinter parties . In simultaneous local balloting , according to preliminary estimates , Duarte 's party was winning in about 200 of 262 municipalities . <P> Washington greeted Duarte 's assumed victory with quiet satisfaction . At a White House press conference , President Reagan declared that " President Duarte is pulling his country together and enjoys wide support from the people . " On Capitol Hill , the House Foreign Affairs Committee saluted the results by relaxing strings attached to $377.9 million in military and economic aid , $54.5 million less than what the Reagan Administration requested for El Salvador this year . Democrat Michael Barnes of Maryland , a leader in the demand for tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election results " a very positive development . " <P> The vote provoked an equally dramatic and unexpected measure of support for Duarte from the 46,000-member Salvadoran armed forces . As ballot boxes began to arrive at election headquarters in the capital of San Salvador , right- wingers led by D'Aubuisson charged that the military had conspired with the Christian Democrats to perpetrate an electoral fraud . The protest stalled official vote counting pending a ruling by the Central Election Council , a three-man body dominated by conservatives . Fears arose that the election might be invalidated .
