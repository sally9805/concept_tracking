As chief architect of one of the world 's largest , most influential news enterprises , TIME 's co-founder and editor Henry R. Luce ( 1898-1967 ) was profoundly aware of the astonishing growth and power of the U.S. press in the 20th century . In 1947 he said , " Today nearly every American 's mind-and soul-is directly and daily affected by the press . " Luce believed that journalism had a dual purpose : " A service first ... of news and comment on public affairs .

But when a news organization gets arrogant or careless for just a few moments , the consequences for the individuals it covers can be catastrophic , and the damage to the craft considerable . " <P> TIME , of course , is no less fallible than its peers . It is keenly aware that the standards and precepts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applicable to this magazine . TIME is rightfully subject to the same public judgments on its accuracy , fairness and responsibility as any other journalistic enterprise .
