Employees of Travelers Corp. don ' t have to go very far when they need a personal computer or software for their offices . The giant insurer operates its own computer store at its main headquarters building in downtown Hartford , Conn . Travelers opened the store in 1982 as a way to help control the sometimes chaotic growth of personal computer use in its offices . Other companies have also realized that they must settle on a few standard types of equipment so that computers in different departments can work with the same information and won ' t be quickly outgrown . But Travelers is apparently among the first companies to set up an in-house store where managers can select computers for their departments . The Computer Store , as Travelers calls its operation , emulates the appearance and approach of an outside retailer in order to overcome managers ' reluctance to deal with an in-house staff . Employees can try out demonstration models of popular brands , mostly International Business Machines Corp . Personal Computers . Travelers gets the big discounts and controls that come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The store has been very effective in cutting down on red tape , " says Marianne Salamone , who uses a desktop computer in her job as assistant director of the company ' s outside marketing . Already Travelers uses at least 2 , 500 personal computers , mostly IBM PCs , and an estimated $4 million of software for the machines . Travelers says it expects to buy up to 7 , 500 more PCs for its employees ( slightly more than 10 , 000 people work in headquarters alone ) . The store recently added Travelers ' s first house brand , a software program called Decision Images that helps managers develop charts , graphs and tables to illustrate presentations . Travelers data-processing department developed the program because it couldn ' t find such software at outside suppliers . The internal charge for the program is between $400 and $500 . Multimate International Corp. , an East Hartford software company , is the store ' s first software supplier so far . The store keeps an inventory of Multimate ' s word-processing program on hand so that managers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrounge around several stores for weeks to find them . Elsewhere , many companies aren ' t quite certain how to handle the computer boom . " Control is most often placed in the hands of purchasing , which we think ultimately is a bit perverse , " says David Ferris , chairman of Ferrin Corp. , a San Francisco company that helps companies install desktop computers . The purchasing department usually shops for the best price , neglecting service needs , he says . While technically minded data-processing managers understand the importance of service , many employees resist their efforts to help . " Most users view the personal computer as a way to escape the data-processing department , " he says . But more companies are trying to take control . Some are organizing in-house educational programs or demonstration centers , and many others are settling on standard computer hardware and software brands . Central management " is the direction Fortune 1 , 000 companies are going , " says Ivonne Dahl , national accounts director of Multimate .
