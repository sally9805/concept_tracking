Although the movie departs from the real story , the heroics of the Hickory High team in Hoosiers rekindle memories of Milan 's triumphant victory in 1954 . Back in 1954 , Milan High , a tiny southeastern Indiana school with 161 students , survived a 751-team tourney to meet the Muncie Central Bearcats in the state basketball finals . Such an improbable matchup between a backwater school and a powerful giant could happen in only a few states , such as Indiana ; nearly all other states place schools in divisions according to enrollment size . And , as you might expect , some Goliath from Indianapolis , Marion , or Muncie has invariably claimed the Hoosier basketball title every year -- every year , that is , except 1954 , when a youngster named Bobby Plump zinged a last-second jump shot that made Milan a household name in Indiana . Milan 's team was led by four boys from Pierceville , population 45 . The quartet  --  Bobby Plump , Glenn Butte , Gene White , and Robert Schroder  --  were tough farm kids , unintimidated by physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the tallest belie Hackman 's portrayal of a fiery coach who once punched a player makes great cinema but bears little resemblance to Milan 's reserved coach , Marvin Wood . was White , at 5 ' I I " . The boys were dirt poor but proud . Plump , for example , came from a home that lacked electricity , telephones , and plumbing . They were also painfully shy everywhere but on the basketball court . Because there was nothing else to do in Pierceville but work and shoot buckets , the boys learned to hang hook shots about the time they learned to wield a pitchfork . When the time came , they teamed up with fiesty Ray Craft of Milan to give Milan High the best squad it ever had or ever would have . Hoosiers , the feel-good movie that 's spread Hoosier hysteria around the country , is the brainchild of two Indiana natives and inveterate basketball fans , David Anspaugh and Angelo Pizzo . The movie , they say , was inspired by the famous Milan-Central game , although the script departs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hickory 's coach , Norman Dale ( played by Gene Hackman ) , is a middle-aged man given a chance to redeem himself for punching a player years earlier . Milan 's coach , Marvin Wood , on the other hand , was a quiet man , a relative babe of 24 who had inherited the team from a volatile but successful Milan character named Snort Grinstead . Wood instituted a slow , ball-control game at Milan called " cat and mouse " ? an affront to fans long used to Grinstead 's run-and-shoot offense . After coaching Milan all the way through the tournament field , Coach Wood angered fans of his underdog Indians by freezing the ball late in the final game as the Muncie Central Bearcats led by two points , 28-26 . Plump actually stood near center court with the ball tucked safely away like a football and held the ball for four minutes and 13 seconds while 15,000 fans grumbled and squirmed . But Wood 's gamble paid off . When the score was tied at 30 , the coach called a time-out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craft and then dribbled down the lane while the crowd counted down the remaining seconds . Seeing an opening , Plump went high in the air and lofted the ball over the fingertips of Muncie 's James Barnes . The ball seemed to take forever to reach the basket , but when it did , the ending was made for Hollywood  --  Milan 32 , Muncie 30 . Wood  --  now the women 's basketball coach at St. Mary 's College in South Bend , Indiana  --  says he devised the ball-holding strategy by accident in an earlier game .

" If he does choose to leave television , rest assured that Tom Selleck wo n't be out of the picture for long . This is one actor who puts the glitter of show business in perspective .

To Port-au-Prince , on those two small feet of hers . She has come all the way from Aquin , where her mother died , and is walking to Port-au-Prince to find her father . And she has nothing to eat and no money . " The shopkeeper looked down at the bread and bananas on the counter . " Give me my ten cents ! " the woman said .

It was all over and the impossible had occurred . " Milan had won . As a result of that win , nine of ten poor boys from Milan received college scholarships . Plump admits he never could have dreamed of attending Butler University , an expensive private school , had he starred on a lesser team . The Milan players insist the movie has n't changed their lives , but they also say they ca n't wait for the team 's annual reunion in late spring to tease Ray Craft , the only Milan player to have a bit part in Hoosiers .
