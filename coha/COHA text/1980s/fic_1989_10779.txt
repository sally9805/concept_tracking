into Ochs 's pocket . The next time Ochs salved his lips , he almost went crazy from the smarting . The stuff raised such blisters that he had to play the Saturday concert with a cotton wool mustache stuck to his upper lip . Now , was that a decent thing to do to a man who was already beginning to have trouble with his embouchure ? And of course that ass Rintoul had to keep riding Ochs about how lucky he was that he had n't used the salve on the end it was intended for . Madoc , tell me the truth . Do you think Ochs 's death could have been due to some other beastly joke ? " " Anything that beastly would hardly count as a joke , Tad . Do you have any idea who doctored the pile medicine ?

He always has a breath on him that would make a horse gag and God help the poor wretch who sits close to him . I 'll have to move Loye ; she 's suffered enough . And people think all a conductor has to do is stand up there and wave a little stick ! " He wrestled with his feelings a moment , then made his final plea . " Madoc , I 've always thought I was a reasonably adequate disciplinarian . I 've never had much trouble with an orchestra before , but this is beyond me . Even the orchestra manager has ratted on me . She 's supposedto have come down with some particularly horrid sort of flu , but I think it 's plain funk . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to cope single-handed . Your mother 's helping all she can , but I 'm stuck with the lot of them until after the festival . I simply do n't know what to do , Madoc . That 's why I sent for you , and that 's why I did n't want Jenny here . I 'd send your mother away if I thought she 'd go , and that 's the first time in our married life I 've wished my Sillie were somewhere I was not . You can see the state I 'm in , son . Can you possibly help me out of this ? " " What you 're asking is pretty much what I do for a living , Tad . I should n't think we 'd have too much trouble pinning down the joker , or jokers .

The string section had n't been bothered a great deal ; the woodwindshad suffered minor harassments . It was the brasses who 'd taken the brunt ; the flutes , neither brass nor wind , had got it , too . Frieda Loye , like Wilhelm Ochs , had been a particular target . " Loye asks for it , I suppose . " Sir Emlyn sighed . " She 's such a stoic while she 's being teased , then she has those screaming fits later on . I blame myself very much for having put the poor woman in front of Rintoul tonight . I 'd thought she 'd be safe enough right under my nose . Fishline on his slide had simply not occurred to me .

Not to worry you further , but what will you do for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my problems . There 'll be musicians enough around at the festival ; we 'll be able to pick someone up . Well , son , I expect your mother will be looking for us . You brought some extra clothes with you , I hope ? " " Yes , Jenny packed me a bag . Which reminds me , I want to give her a ring before we go . Is there a telephone I can use ? " " Oh , we conductors are lords of the earth . They give us everything but peace of mind . Right over there in the corner , bach . I 'll leave you to it , shall I ? " " No , stick around and say hello . Jenny 'd rather talk to you than me any time . " " You would n't be trying to make me feel better ? " Madoc was trying , and he was succeeding . He was only a little bit reluctant to turn the telephone over to his father once he 'd got through explaining to his wife why she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father took over , then Annabelle got on the extension phone , then Lady Rhys came in to see what was keeping her menfolk , and they had a jolly interfamily round robin . Madoc had no idea who was going to get stuck with paying for this lengthy call and he did n't much care . Sir Emlyn was looking a great deal less frazzled by the time they rang off ; that was surely worth a few dollars of the orchestra 's expense money.  | " And now , " said Lady Rhys , " we really must get cracking . Lucy wants us all aboard the bus to the airport . We 've already kept her waiting , I 'm afraid , but it was worth it . Your Jenny is such an absolute love , Madoc ! If only Dafydd could find himself another one like her . " Another woman like the former Janet Wadman , assuming there ever could be one , would have more sense than to get herself tangled up with Dafydd , Madoc thought . However , he was n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . He went to pick up his unpretentious suitcase , discovered Mrs. Shadd had already organized a flunky to carry it out for him , and reconciled himself with no great difficulty to acting the undistinguished son of a V.I.P.There were fewer than twenty of them on the bus . Madoc did n't know who they all were but he could n't see where there 'd be much chance for getting in any detection here , so he settled himself for a brief nap . Early in his career , he 'd learned the invaluable knack of grabbing a few winks when an opportunity presented itself . Hence he was among the most alert members of the party when they boarded the aircraft . This was not a big plane , there were barely enough seats for their party ; but it was a customized Grumman , lent for the occasion by a very rich patron of the orchestra . The regular passengers ' seats were comfortably padded armchairs , one on each side of the aisle . The four chairs in the tiny forward cabin were real lounge chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footrests that popped out when the sitter leaned back . He and his parents got three of these , naturally . The fourth went to the concertmaster , an incredibly **29;16527;TOOLONG of fifty or so with one dramatic white streak in his black hair . Monsieur Houdon made one or two agreeable remarks to the Rhyses , then settled down with the score of a Beethoven violin concerto of which he 'd be playing the solo parts during the upcoming festival . From then on , he rehearsed his music on an imaginary instrument , no doubt with surpassing skill , all the time he was n't stopping to eat or drink . Madoc had at first thought Lucy Shadd might be planning to take that seat for herself , but it did n't look as though the director of operationsintended to do any sitting whatever . They were hardly airborne before she was around with a tray of champagne in plastic goblets . This was a gift from another generous patron , she informed everybody up and down the aisle . Then she served out assorted sandwiches , thenp23coffee with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes , then fruit and cheese , then liqueurs . Finally she came again with a vast box of incredibly expensive chocolates , still another gift from yet a different patron whose name Madoc did n't bother to catch since none of the chocolates appeared to be stuffed with arsenic . After the chocolates , she distributed damp , hot finger towels and blankets and pillows to all who wanted them . At long last , she sat down in the front seat of the rear section and put her feet up . They were taking a more northerly route than had been planned . This , the co-pilot had explained over the public address system somewherebetween the champagne and the pastries , was on account of some turbulence that had unexpectedly manifested itself to the south of them . Their plane , though a good plane and a safe plane , was not a new plane , a large plane , or a powerful enough plane to climb above the weather . It was n't a fast plane , either , as planes went these days . They still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route would delay them still further . Madoc did n't care . The chair was comfortable , the food had been more than ample , the passengers behind him had either quieted down or could n't be heard above the roar of the engines . His mother and father , experienced troupers that they were , had already nodded off with their heads on their headrests and their shoeless feet on their footrests . He was thinking seriously of following their excellent example when he became aware that the turbulence was no longer to the south of them . The co-pilot came on again . " Sorry folks , we thought we 'd be able to give you a smooth ride by changing course , but it looks as if the storm 's caught up with us . We may be experiencing some real roughness for a little while . " He was absolutely right . The roughness they were experiencing was like no tossing around any of them had been through before . The copilotwas still jovial . " Hope you 've all got your seat belts securely fastened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make sure your tray tables are put away and locked . We 'll be out of this in a  --  " The plane dropped what felt like a thousand feet straight down , and then began to buck . Madoc could feel the belt cutting into his stomach as his body was hurled clear of the seat . It was like being inside a crazy/mad brahma bull . He could hear the engines straining for altitude . They were going up , higher , higher  --  now they were dropping , hitting , lurchinglike a car in a skid on the side of a cliff . The lights went out . The engines cut off . The co-pilot said , quite clearly in the sudden stillness , " Jesus ! " " Everybody fasten your seat belts , quick . Put your head on your knees and your arms around your head . Sorry , but I guess we 're going down . " Madoc could n't see his parents , but he knew they 'd be hunched over as bidden ; Tad in his shabby tweeds , Mum still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy to change before the luggage was sent off . They 'd have their arms around each other , he thought . He smiled over at them through the blackness , tucked down his head , sent a great wave of love to Janet , and waited . They landed quite gently , all things considered . It was still pitch dark , and a few people were screaming . Madoc pulled out his little pocket flashlight and flicked it on . His parents were all right , blinking at him and trying to smile , still with their arms entwined . Jacques-Marie Houdon sat up , nodded , and played something on his imaginary violin . Mrs. Shadd looked not only terrified but outraged that her schedule had been disrupted . Madoc got rather shakily to his feet and walked the few steps to the cockpit . The pilot and co-pilot were sitting there like a pair of statues , both of them stark white in the faces , both of them with their eyes wide open , staring straight ahead . Madoc was the one who managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father has some brandy in his briefcase . " That joggled them back to life . They all three started to laugh . It was the funniest thing that had ever happened . The pilot reached down beside him and picked up an emergency lantern . The co-pilot lifted a sliding door on the wall and hauled out half a dozen ordinary flashlights . Still giggling , Madoc took five of the flashlights along with his own , switched on a couple , and went back into the cabin . " Here , Tad , have a light . Could you spare a little of your brandy for the pilots ? " " Give me that torch . I 'll take it to them . There 's plenty of brandy . " Now that she had something to do , Lucy Shadd was calm enough . She unscrambled herself from her seat belt and began to bustle . " Just as well . " Sir Emlyn was smiling his gentle , familiar smile . " Ip25was planning to finish off that brandy myself Straight from the bottle . Eh Sillie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful man ! " Lady Rhys was laughing , adoring . Madoc went along into the main cabin . " All right , folks , it 's safe to come up . We 're on the ground . I do n't know where and we do n't seem to have any electricity , but we 're all in one piece , are n't we ? " " You mean we do n't get to play Nearer My God To Thee ' ? " That was , oddly enough , Frieda Loye , looking quite cocky and pleased with her own joke , such as it was . So was everybody else . Laugh and the world laughs with you , Madoc thought . Thank God there 'd be no weeping alone this time around . They were all climbing up from between the seats , checking their instruments , counting their fingers . First things first . Lady Rhys was out in the aisle now , helping Lucy Shadd carry around the drinks . Sir Emlyn was sitting quietly in his armchair , leafing through his scores and sipping at his brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points and went forward again to the cockpit . " Any idea where we are , gentlemen ? " " If you 're looking for a simple yes or no , the answer 's no , " said the pilot . " I do n't know what the Christ we ran into , but it tossed us clear to hell and gone and knocked out our whole damned electrical system . I suppose that 's why the engines quit . Unless they fell off , which is also possible . The radio 's not working , nothing 's working up here except my wristwatch , and that 's probably wrong because I do n't know which time zone we 're in . We 'd been flying on instruments through solid overcastfor quite a while , which you probably did n't realize . " " My God ! How did you find the ground ? " " I think it must have been angels , " the pilot replied in all seriousness . " When the engines cut out and the lights went off , the clouds broke and the moon came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open strip . We 'd dropped out of the turbulence into a nice , steady tailwind , so we just glided in . Angels are the only reasonable explanation . " He was probably right , Madoc thought . " Why do n't we open the door and see if they 're still around ? " " Great idea . God , I 'm wobbly . " " I 'll get the door , Mac , " said the co-pilot . " You brought us down . Here , drink the rest of this brandy . "  |p26Together  , he and Madoc got the cockpit door open and the steps lowered . It was cold , almost bitter . That tailwind was really going after the clouds now . The moon was n't at the full , but it was casting enough light to show them a landscape straight out of a Lex Laramie novel . Behind the aircraft was only open plain ; in front were the Deadeye Saloon and the Miners ' Rest Hotel , both of them shut tighter than a drugstore cowboy 's Levis . The co-pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've hit a ghost town . This place is dead as a doornail . " " It 's dead all right , " Madoc agreed , " but I 'm not sure it 's a genuine ghost town . Looks a bit slick for that , would n't you say ? " " Hell , yes , now that you mention it . This is probably just a movie set , a lot of false fronts with nothing behind ' em . The Hollywood guys are doing a lot of their filming in Canada nowadays , you know . Come on , we might as well know the worst . " " Perhaps we 'd better put on our jackets first , and close the plane door , " Madoc suggested . " The cabin will cool down fast enough withoutour wasting what heat there is . " And the plane might be the only shelter they 'd have for who knew how long a time ? Madoc wished the co-pilot had n't mentioned a movie set . As they got closer , that was exactly what the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . The fronts were in fact falsely mock-pretentious , but the modest frame buildings behind them were solid enough . There were n't many : the hotel , the saloon , which was probably a restaurant also ; a somewhat anachronistic nickelodeon which had posters of old Tim Holt and Tom Mix Western movies out front ; a few tightly shuttered gift and clothing shops ; a general store ; a so-called museum with a badly carved life-sized wooden mule tied to a hitching post out front . There was the sheriff 's office , of course , with a big gold star painted on the door ; the barbershop with its striped pole and a sign in the window reading SHAVE AND HAIRCUT 2 BITS . TEETH PULLED 25  --  EXTRA . " No sign of a watchman around , " Madoc remarked . " Who the hell would be willing to stay ? " grunted the co-pilot . " I have a hunch I know where we are . Somebody was telling me about a speculator who 'd reopened one of the abandoned mining towns as a tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I 'm not sure whether it was on the Alberta or the British Columbia side , but I 'll bet you a nickel this is it . They only open the place up about three months a year , I believe . Nobody 'd come anyway , once the snows begin . We must have been blown a hell of a lot farther north than I thought we were . Now what do we do ? " " Burglarize , I think , " said Madoc . " The hotel would be our best bet . They probably have a dynamo and some kind of battery-operated teleradioaffair , should n't you think ? Not to mention a stove and possibly some food . Are there any tools in the plane ? They 've got deadbolts on the doors , but we could probably jimmy a shutter off one of the groundfloorwindows if we had something to pry with . " " No problem . I 'd better tell the passengers to stay put till we knowp28where we stand here , had n't I ? I must say I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . " " The singers and the winds are worried about the night air on their throats , " Madoc explained , " and the rest have probably gone back to sleep . Go ahead and talk to them . I 'll poke around for a likely place to break in . By the way , what 's your name ? " " Ed Naxton . My partner 's Steve MacVittie . And you 're Sir something-or-other , like your dad , I suppose . Sorry , I 'm not up on that nobility stuff . " " I 'm not so hot on it , either . Anyway , my father 's only a knight . You have to be a baron or better to count as a peer . Call me Madoc , why do n't you ? " " Sure , Madoc , long as it does n't get me slapped in the family dungeon . I 'll be right back . God , I hope there 's a stove in that dump . " It was cold here , really cold . Perhaps Ed was minding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the various hypochondriacs on board . Madoc himself was feeling the chill . He 'd only brought a mackintosh to wear over his suit ; he 'd thought it would be plenty when he left home . Now he wondered whether Janet had thought to pack him a pullover . He also wondered whether Ed and Mac would be able to open the Grumman 's luggage compartment if the passengers were going to be on the ground for any length of time . But mostly he wondered how they were going to get into the hotel . The answer seemed to lie in a somewhatwobbly shutter on the side of the building next to the Deadeye Saloon . By the time Ed showed up with some airgoing equivalent of a wreckingbar , Madoc had managed to joggle a few screws loose enough from the dried-out wood of the window frame to slide the bar underneath . After that , it was a piece of cake . Ed , being much the larger , boosted Madoc through the window they had n't even had to smash , and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way through a dusty hallway that was cold as banished hope into an even colder expanse that must be the lobby . He found the front door and released an assortment of bolts and bars in order to let in Ed and a little more cold . " Now to find that radio , eh ? It ought to be here behind the desk , should n't you think ? "  | " Nope , " said Ed . " It 'll be through that door marked No ADMITTANCEso 's the tourists ' kids ca n't monkey with it . " Ed would be right , of course . Madoc decided he himself must be even more tired than he 'd thought he was . At least his skill at housebreaking had n't yet deserted him . The door was locked , but the lock was n't much . There was , as expected , a radio , a highly modern and sophisticatedaffair totally out of keeping with the Wild West decor . Its batteries were dead . There was no way to recharge them , and no spares were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flossy black iron parlor stove with a lot of curlicues on top , though . It was sitting smack in the middle of the lobby , with a heap of ready-cut stove wood beside it . " Would n't hurt to get a fire going , " Ed grunted . " Some of ' em are acting pretty restless back there . " " I do n't suppose there 's any hope of your getting the plane 's radio fixed any time soon , is there ? " Madoc asked . " We wo n't be able to find out what went wrong with the electrical system till we get enough daylight to see by . As to whether we 'd be able to fix it , that 's another question . Maybe we 'd better just figure on campinghere for the time being , do n't you think ? " After a trial run with a few wadded-up newspapers and a handful of kindling to make sure the chimney had n't been blocked up for the winter , they managed to get the stove throwing out some heat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , good ! " She set down the overnight case she was carrying and rubbed her hands together in the glow from the isinglass-paned door . " At least it 's one step in the right direction . Where 's the kettle , Madoc ? " " One might also ask where 's the water , Mother . I 'll go see what I can drum up . " " I 'll come with you . " The director of operations left the doorway , where she 'd been shepherding in the stragglers off the plane , and darted to Madoc 's side before Lady Rhys could get there . " Men can never find anything . Which way is the kitchen ? " How was he supposed to know ? Madoc was beginning to feel that it might be possible to work up a fairly vigorous dislike for Lucy Shadd , but of course he owed it to hisfather 's position not to show any such ungallant sentiment . " Back here , I should think , " he answered mildly ,  |p30wondering  just how either of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of water on top of all these wrought-iron exuberances . He led the way to the kitchen unerringly , since there were so few places it could have been anyway . The room looked to be fairly well equipped with kettles and pots of various kinds . There were plenty of plates and mugs , and a supply closet stocked with various dried and canned foods , along with canisters of tea , sugar , salt , and other staples . Water was a different matter . Lucy Shadd was at the sink , turning the taps without any luck . " What 's the matter with these things ? I ca n't get the water to come out . " " No , it will have been shut off before the owners left , " he managed to explain without laughing in her face . " That is common procedure when a place is closed up for the winter . Water left in the pipes would cause them to freeze up and burst . " " Well , how was I supposed to know ? I 'm not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Turn it back on , ca n't you ? " " I do n't know whether I can or not . I expect this place has a drilled well . That means the water has to be pumped up by means of a generator . I do n't know where the generator is . I will find it and get it working if I can . I would say it is unlikely anybody in your party will have died of thirst before somebody finds us . It is , however , quite probable that some of your charges would appreciate having beds to lie down on . Since you feel obliged to make yourself useful , why do n't you go and check the bedrooms ? You will no doubt find them upstairs . The stairs are to your right as you face the desk in the lobby , in case you were about to ask . " " Thank you .

There were no propane tanks to be found . He went back to the sink , investigated an antique hand pump that he 'd thought was intended as a part of the atmosphere , and found after some experimentalfiddling that it worked just fine . He filled a large tea kettle and carried it into the lobby all by himself without help from anybody . " Here 's your water , Mother . "  | " Thank you , Madoc . " Lady Rhys picked up a square pad of folded canvas that had been left sitting on top of the woodpile and used it to grasp the curlicues . The ornaments came off in one piece , leaving a neat round hole just big enough for the kettle in the top of the stove . " Set it right here , dear . Did you find any cups and saucers ? " " Plenty of mugs . And tea , sugar , and dried milk . I 'll bring some , shall I ? " " I 'll help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Delicia Fawn . Madoc could n't think why some of the male musicians snickered , until he got to the kitchen . Delicia was not a shy woman . " What do you say , dark and delicious ? Care to try out for the semifinals ? " Madoc knew that singers did breathing exercises , and that deep breathing tended to stimulate pectoral development , but did all sopranosbreathe as deeply as this one ? It was disconcerting , feeling those twin thumps on his waistcoat every time she inhaled . He said , " Semifinals for what ? " and knew right away that he 'd made a potentiallyserious mistake . " Look , sweetie , " she drawled , running her fingers through his hair without being invited , " you ca n't tell a musician by the size of his piccolo , can you ? Before I make any decision about who 's going to play my organ for the rest of the tour , I hold auditions , that 's all . Saves a lot of fuss and bother , eh .

Besides , I 'm not staying with the tour once we get to Vancouver , " he hoped , " and you 'd only have to run the auditions over again after I left . Here , take the teapot and canister to my mother , will you ? I 'll bring the mugs . " Of whom he 'd passed up the chance to become one . So this was why his mother would n't let her husband travel alone . Unchaperoned , poor old Tad would have been torn apart by some sex-starved maenad long ago . Here was a side of his parents ' life that he 'd never imagined to exist , much less thought to be experiencing . He picked up a trayful of thick white mugs with " Thar 's gold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back to the lobby in a state of considerable bemusement . These people did n't really need tea , Madoc thought . They 'd been stuffing on one thing and another since they left Wagstaffe . What he supposed his mother thought they did need was the feeling of having found a safe shelter that the homely hot drink would help to create . Considering the circumstances that had got them here , she was probably right . It was interesting to see his mother being Mum to a planeload of musicians . However , Madoc did n't feel he had time to stand around admiring the gracious manner in which Lady Rhys was dispensing the mug that cheered but did not inebriate , to the possible regret of Cedric Rintoul and a few more like him . There were oil lamps in the kitchen ; a few of them had better be got going before somebody broke a leg rushingup those stairs to where the line would hypothetically be forming . Madoc supposed he ought to find out how Miss Efficiency was makingout with the beds , too ; nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fawn , having done her bit with the sugar bowl , had got herself a mug of tea and was snuggling up to the stove . Warming up for the main event , no doubt . Madoc went back to the kitchen and started filling lamps . Once he 'd set a lighted lamp on the desk and another one on the landing to illuminate the stairway , the dingy lobby began to look almost cheery . Madoc carried a couple more to the second floor and set one of them on a bracket in the upstairs hallway that had most likely been installed for that very purpose . Then , still carrying the other lamp , he followed the gleam of the battery lantern Lucy Shadd had commandeeredto a linen closet where she was snatching blankets and pillows off the shelves with the concentrated zeal of a deacon counting the Sunday morning collection . " We have water from the hand pump in the kitchen sink , " he informedher , " and oil lamps with which we 'll have to be careful .

Here , give me that lamp . You take the blankets . I had n't bargained for being a chambermaid on top of everything else , I must say . " " Ca n't you ask some of the others to help you ? " " And have the Musicians ' Union down on my neck ? That 's not the way things are done in this crowd . " " Then do n't ask .

" She darted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensing blankets as directed . The rooms were pretty much as he 'd thought they 'd be ; little boxes with roughly plastered walls and softwood floors studded with the dents of many boot heels . The furnishings were rag rugs , mismatched iron beds with old-fashioned coil springs and nice new foam mattresses wrapped in plastic against the possible forays of wintering rodents , rickety chests and washstands in that cheap yellowishwood that ages so ungracefully . There were chipped enamel pitchers and basins on the stands and , yes , enamel pots under the beds . " Let 's hear it for authenticity , " said Lucy with a wry sort of gratitude . " Now how the bloody hell do we heat water enough for everybodyto wash in ? " " We do n't , " said Madoc .

Most of the others were sitting around looking glum , a few were nodding off in the not very comfortable wooden chairs . Lucy stood on the second step from the bottom , holding her lamp like Florence Nightingale . " There are beds upstairs for any of you who want to lie down . They 're not made up , but I 've managed to find blankets and pillows . Most of us will have to double up , so please take the roommate you had in Atlanta .

If you want cold water to wash with , Mr. Rhys tells me you can get some from a pump in the kitchen . He 'll help you work it . The rooms do have rudimentary facilities , and I 'm afraid we 'll just have to make the best of them for this once . If you 'd rather stay down here by the stove , of course , feel free . I apologize for the inconvenience . " " Why should you ? " Lady Rhys demanded . " It was n't your fault . For goodness ' sake , Lucy , go get some rest yourself . You must be worn to a frazzle . " " Thank you , Lady Rhys . I 'll put a lamp in your room , and see about getting your bed made up . " " Nonsense , Madoc will do all that . Good night , Lucy . "  |p35While  doing his stint at the pump , Madoc at last got to sort out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cramped lobby ; in fact there were n't all that many . What they boiled down to were the three Rhyses , the four singers , the concertmaster ( who was , as always , the principal violin ) , and seven of the other principals : viola , cello , flute , clarinet , oboe , trumpet , and trombone . Wilhelm Ochs would have been the eighth . The other principals had opted for the train , either because they detested flying or because they wanted to be near their cumbersomeinstruments even if they could n't take them out of the trunks en route . Lucy Shadd turned out to be the only one of the ten staff members traveling with them . The media director had gone on ahead some days ago , luckily for him . The orchestra manager , of course , had been forced by her malady to miss the flight . The luckless woman who bore the impressive title of assistant to the music director had been banished to the train because Sir Emlyn did n't much like having her follow him around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Lady Rhys . The two pilots had been persuaded to leave their increasingly frigid aircraft by the warmth of the stove and Lady Rhys 's persuasion , not to mention Delicia Fawn 's . If in fact the soprano was their goal , though , they might be in for a bit of a letdown . Joe Ragovsky , the principal violist , had already confided to Madoc that he 'd be well advised not to waste his time , as if he 'd been going to anyway . " As soon as you got inside the door , she 'd hand you a surgical mask and a bottle of some god-awful-tasting antiseptic mouthwash . You 'd have to gargle and put on the mask or nothing doing . Delicia comes onp36strong enough , but when push comes to shove , she thinks a damned sight more of her voice than she does of her men . " If any of these chaps still had enough stamina left for a sociable gargle after a night like this one , more power to them , Madoc thought as he waggled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first customer had been the contralto , a comfortably padded woman of forty or so with a spiritual expression , a heavy braid of dark brown hair , and the almost certainly adopted name of Norma Bellini . She had n't spoken all evening , as far as he knew , except to say " Dank you " in a low , thrilling tone when he 'd filled her pitcher . She 'd had the air of somebody who just wanted to take out her hairpins , slip off her shoes , and lie down ; and who could blame her ? The bass was Carlos Pitney . He 'd be called a black man , Madoc supposed , though in fact he had nothing black about him except his well-polished shoes . His skin was the color of walnut , his hair a uniform steel-gray , his eyes a lighter shade of brown than Madoc 's own . He was gravely courteous in his demeanor , stately in his address , and quite willing to pump for himself , though he could n't get the knack of the quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the difference between a gush and a hollow gurgle . The tenor , on the other hand , made no effort to lift a finger but chatted pleasantly enough about what a pity it was that Madoc 's brother Dafydd had not succeeded in attaining the pinnacle of excellencewhich he himself had mastered in some particular aspect of vocalization . As far as Madoc was concerned , the man might as well have been talking Choctaw . He had n't bothered to introduce himself , no doubt taking it for granted that Madoc would know the name of anyone famous enough to sing for Sir Emlyn . Madoc had found out easily enough from Delicia Fawn , who 'd dropped by to get some gargling water and to find out whether Madoc might care to reconsider . The man was Ainsworth Kight , he was older than he looked , his impressive head of chestnutcoloredhair was mostly toupee , and he 'd never even made it to the semifinals . Ainsworth was as good a singer as he said he was , though , so none of the rest mattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher and one with a water pistol that needed filling . The obnoxious Cedric Rintoul did not become less so on closer acquaintance . The principal trumpeter , Jasonp37Jasper , did n't impress Madoc all that favorably , either , even though he offered to show Madoc his impressive collection of whoopee cushions if they ever reconnected with the wardrobe trunks . Nothing was supposed to go into those trunks except the clothes worn for performances , but obviously a good many extraneous articles did , and some necessities did n't . Madoc remembered that onstage Jasper had been wearing black socks pulled over his tan shoes and a white tie deftly folded out of toilet paper . He had n't been the only orchestra member in makeshift attire ; Madoc had gathered they did n't do it to be funny . Jacques-Marie Houdon , the concertmaster , had been impeccable onstage , and still was . He took his filled pitcher , nodded affably , and went away . Joe Ragovsky , the violist , a likeable chap from the wheatfields of Manitoba , offered to pump and succeeded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dufresne , whom Lady Rhys had alluded to as a most agreeable woman even if she did walk bowlegged , as cello players tended to do . Tonight Miss Dufresne had on a voluminous gray wool dirndl and floppy leather boots , so Madoc could n't tell much about her walk , but he assumed his mother was right . She generally was . Frieda Loye , the flautist , gave Madoc a nervous little smile and gasped , " Oh , that 's enough . You must n't bother about me , " when her pitcher was less than halfway filled . The clarinetist , Corliss Blair , settled for a mug since she was to share Helene Dufresne 's room and hence her pitcher . The oboist did n't come to be pumped , but Joe Ragovsky said his name was David Gabriel and they 'd be bunking together . Sir Emlyn and Lady Rhys would share a room , of course . The selfsacrificingLucy Shadd was apparently going to take on Frieda Loye and her nightmares as part of the job . The two brass players would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two pilots . Theoretically , that meant the concertmaster and Norma Bellini would have rooms to themselves , since it did n't seem likely that the contralto would care for a menage a trois with Delicia Fawn and whoever might have won the toss tonight . That would appear to take up the ten rooms , with none left over for Madoc Rhys . However , this would not be the case , according to the informative Mr. Ragovsky , since Monsieur Houdon would in fact be paying his respectful attentions to Madame Bellini although nobody was supposed to notice . The way things looked right now , there 'd probably be at least one spare bed in the pilots ' room , too.  |p38While  the rest got themselves sorted out upstairs , Madoc occupied himself building a fire in the big kitchen range , filling the hot-water reservoir on the back , and setting a copper washtub of water on top . That should be enough for the morning ablutions . He put more wood in the lobby stove , shut down the dampers , and went to seek what rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on toward five A.M. , or not as the case might be . Four or three , maybe , according to how many time zones they 'd been blown across . The Grumman most likely had not yet been reportedoverdue , its flying time was probably longer than a commercial plane 's . The train would n't be due in for ages yet . There was nobody out here to report a downed aircraft without any lights ; nobody would be looking for them . Back in Fredericton , Janet and Annabelle would be thinking about getting up even though they did n't have to ; they were both early risers by habit . They 'd sit a long time over the breakfast table , planning their day , talking family , catching up on Pitcherville gossip , of which there was never any dearth . They 'd go over again the details of the cozy chat they 'd had last night with Madoc and his parents . Madoc was humbly thankful his Jenny would have that to think about instead of a phone call from some reporter wanting to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a widow . She 'd feel a little bit let down if he did n't call her again tonight , but she would n't really start to worry for another day or so . He found a room with sagging twin beds and nobody in either one of them , shed the three-piece tweed suit he 'd been wearing to placate his mother , and wished he 'd had the foresight to bring a separate overnight case as all the other passengers appeared to have done . He could borrow Tad 's shaving things in the morning , and perhaps even a change of linen . Keeping his socks and underwear on , he wrapped himself in a couple of itchy blankets and stretched out on one of the beds . Luck was with him ; he got almost a full hour 's sleep before the screeching began . " My God , what 's that ? " The voice was not his own . In the grayness of almost-dawn , Madoc was interested to see that he 'd acquired a roommate . MacVittie must have won the semifinals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well he might . The noise was dreadful . " As an educated guess , I 'd say it 's our flautist having her customaryp39nightmare , " Madoc explained . " My father told me Mrs. Loye puts on quite a turn when she gets going . " " I 'll say she does . Sounds like a pig getting its throat cut . " With the speed of much practice , Madoc was already into shirt , coat , and trousers . " I 'll go . My mother seems to have elected me general handyman . " Grateful that he 'd opted to keep his socks on against the desperate chill of the mountain night , he slid his feet into his shoes and tied the laces . The lamp he 'd brought to light the narrow upstairs hallway was still feebly aglow , doing its small best against the approaching daylight . Madoc knew just how it felt . Why could n't the confounded woman have taken to insomnia instead of nightmares ? He was not the first on the scene . Lady Rhys had beaten him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of russet , green , and yellow velour . Madoc supposed she must sometimes get sick of all that black . She was standing over another twin bed like the one Madoc had just got out of , shaking a slender woman by the shoulders . " Frieda , wake up and quit screaming . You sound like a runaway train . Sir Emlyn needs his sleep , you know . " " Mother , " Madoc said gently , " that 's not Frieda . " Lady Rhys groped among her gaudy swathings for the ever-present silver chain around her neck , found her Victorian silver lorgnette somewherealong the line , and flicked it open . " Why , so it is n't . Lucy , whateveris the matter with you ? " " I  --  he  --  water , please ! " The voice was croaky and almost incoherent . " Madoc , get her some water . He what , Lucy ? Who did ? Here , drink this . " She held the thick mug Madoc had filled from the pitcher to the hysterical woman 's lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " My throat . He  --  " Lucy Shadd was n't shrieking anymore , but her roommate was . " Madoc , go get that lamp , " his mother ordered . " Quickly . Frieda , stop making those ghastly noises . Do you need some water , too ? " Frieda cut herself off in mid-yelp . " Lucy woke me up . " She made the accusation in something of a self-satisfied tone , as if it were a triumph for her not to have been the waker this time . " But you were screaming right along with her , " Lady Rhys pointed out.  | " I was screaming at Lucy to tell me why she was screaming . " " You were not ! " cried Lucy . " You were screaming at him , too . You were just as scared as I was . " " Was I ? I do n't remember being scared . Him who ? " " I do n't know . " Lucy fell back in exhaustion upon her slipless pillow . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What was ? " " Being strangled . If Frieda had n't begun to yowl and frightened him off , he 'd have killed me . He meant to , I could feel it . You saved my life , Frieda , truly you did . " " Did I really ? I 'm so glad , Lucy . What  --  what did he do ? " " He put something around my neck and pulled it tight . I could feel it cutting into my skin . I suppose I must have made some kind of noise . I do n't know . It woke me up , the pain and choking . Then you piped up and I felt the thing slacken and he ran off . " " He who ? " Madoc prodded . " Did you get a look at him ? " " No , everything was blurry . I think he 'd put something over his face . One of those stocking masks . You know . " " But you 're sure it was a man ? " " It must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That does n't mean anything , " said Lady Rhys . " All instrumentalistshave strong hands , they exercise them so much . You of all people ought to know that , Lucy . Bring the lamp closer , Madoc , so I can get a look at her throat . " Madoc 's younger , keener eyes had already taken note of the thin line around Lucy Shadd 's none too swanlike throat . Fishline , he thought , remembering that small but effective instrument of torture he 'd seen attached to Cedric Rintoul 's trombone during the performance . That had been sadistic enough , but this was something else . He was not yet sure what . " Mrs. Shadd , " he said , " would you mind sitting up , or at least rolling over so we can see the back of your neck ? " She obeyed without question . The red line was there , too . " You say the garotte was already around your neck when you woke up ? " " Yes , it was . Do n't make me say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , Mrs. Shadd . I know this is unpleasant for you . I 'm just trying to understand how the would-be strangler managed to get hisp41line all the way around your neck without waking you . You would have been lying down with your head on the pillow , would you ? " " Yes , certainly . I do n't sleep standing up . I suppose the answer is that I was totally exhausted and it took something really drastic to wake me . You must remember , Mr. Rhys , that I 'd been stuck for the past several days with the orchestra manager 's job as well as my own , which is taxing enough at the best of times . I 've had a tremendous lot of responsibilityand very little rest . And last night was n't exactly peaceful , with that awful business about Wilhelm and having to get the orchestra off . Not to mention just missing a plane crash . That was the closest brush I 'd had with death until just now , and I have to say two in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite understand , " said Lady Rhys . " Now you 'd better just lie there and try to get some more sleep . Do n't worry , Lucy , we 'll make sure nothing else happens to you . I have some tablets , if you 'd like something to calm you down . " " I have n't got time to be calm . What about the bathwater ? " " It 's all taken care of , " Madoc told her . " You 'd better take the tablet . You 'll be no good to anybody if you wear yourself out completely . " " That 's easy for you to say . Who 's going to manage the breakfast ? " " Oh , for goodness ' sake , Lucy , " Frieda protested , " quit trying to be Superwoman . You ca n't even boil an egg , you said so yourself . " " I 'll get a tablet , " said Lady Rhys , and the matter was settled . It was odd , Madoc thought , that still none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They must all be more used to Frieda Loye 's nightmares than he 'd have thought possible . But as Lucy Shadd had just pointed out , the lot of them had been through a colleague'ssudden death and a near-crash after a hard evening 's work and half a night of travel . Maybe their disinclination to leave their hard-won beds was n't so strange , at that . While his mother went for the tablets , he took up the lamp and started nosing around for what he might discover . It did n't take him two seconds to spot the length of thin wire thrown down beside the bed . " That 's not just wire , " Frieda said when he held it up . " It 's a violin string . An A-string , I should say , but I 'm no authority . Joe or Helene could tell you . Or Monsieur Houdon , I suppose , if you had nerve enough to ask him . "  | " Oh , I 'm a nervy sort of fellow , " Madoc assured her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not particularly . Stores that sell musical instruments have them . Or you can send away for them , or borrow one in a pinch . String players always carry extras . One can break or go false on you and have to be replaced . " " What happens to the broken ones ? Can they be mended ? " " Oh no , that would n't be worthwhile . They just get thrown away . Unless a person took a notion to twist them into flowerpot hangers or something . I must say I 've never heard of anybody who did . Strings are no big deal , Mr. Rhys . I 've bought them often enough myself , as a favor . " Frieda Loye emitted an odd little snort of laughter . " I remember years and years ago , when I was still at the conservatory . I was waiting for a bus to go to the music store . I had a bunch of errands for some of the crowd and when the bus pulled in , this girl who 'd stopped to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Everybody looked at us as if we must be a couple of strippers or something . I was so embarrassed , I got off the bus before my stop . You do silly things when you 're young . And sometimes when you 're old enough to know better , too . " She sounded awfully bitter . Madoc wondered what she 'd done that was so foolish ; however , it could hardly be germane to the matter at hand . " You saw nothing of this intruder ? " " No , nothing at all . As Lucy says , we 'd had an exhausting trip and I was glad to get to bed . I just wish I 'd been able to sleep longer ; I feel like a worn-out dishrag . Though naturally I 'm glad I woke up in time to save Lucy 's life , " Frieda added in an almost laughably polite little-girl voice . " It 's funny I did n't see him go out , though , " she went on . " He must have been awfully quick . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could be in one of those fugue states Freud used to go on about . Do I mean Freud ? I read something once he wrote about a boy who 'd been scared by a rooster . Unless I 'm thinking of somebody else . I 'm not much of a reader , I have to admit . Except music , of course . " " When you read music , do you wear glasses ? " " If you mean do I need glasses to see , why do n't you say so ? I 'm not particularly thin-skinned , you know . One ca n't be , working with anp43orchestra . Yes , I need glasses and so does Lucy . We both wear contacts . What do you want to bet the reason everything looked blurry to her is that she just did n't have her contacts in ? Lucy 's eyes are much worse than mine , " Frieda added rather smugly . " That 's right , Frieda . " Lucy spoke wearily , as if her throat was botheringher a good deal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't remember having taken them out . I must be even more exhausted than I thought I was . First Wilhelm , then the plane , now this . I do n't know how much more I can take . " " You do n't have to take anything , Lucy . Except this . " Lady Rhys was back with the tablets . " They 're quite mild , really . It 's just to help you get back to sleep . Madoc , pour her some more water . Frieda , do n't you think perhaps you ought to take one , too ? " " Here ? In this room ? " " Now Frieda , you do n't honestly believe that chap would dare to come again in broad daylight ? But 1 ' 11 sit right here with you if you 're nervous . " The flautist appeared to find Lady Rhys 's offer more nervous-making than the prospect of a return visit from the strangler . " No , really , Lady Rhys , I could n't think of putting you to the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream if anything happens . I 'm good at that , you know . " Frieda Loye managed a twitch of a smile . " But would you mind terribly explaining to Sir Emlyn that I was n't the one who screamed first this time ? I know it 's silly , but  --  " " Nonsense , dear . I know just how you feel , and I 'll certainly tell him . But you must n't worry , my son wo n't let anything happen to either one of you . " " Your son ? " croaked Lucy . " What can he do ? " " Madoc can do whatever is necessary , I assure you . " Lady Rhys drew herself up to her most imposing stance , took a deep breath , and bit the bullet . " My son , " she announced in full , rich , pear-shaped tones , " is a policeman . "  |p44After  one incredulous snicker apiece , Frieda and Lucy accepted Lady Rhys 's declaration . It was not possible that the conductor 's wife would have joked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , of course , but Madoc rather wished his mother had n't chosen that particular moment to be noble . Now that his cover had been blown , there was no hope of sneaking back for another forty winks . Madoc did , however , return to the room he 'd been using , found Ed Naxton sound asleep , and decided to leave the poor chap to it . He thought it unlikely that either of the pilots could be involved in what was happening to the orchestra , though it was axiomatic that one never knew . He tucked in his shirttail , put on his waistcoat under his jacket , ran his pocket comb through his hair , cursed the lack of a toothbrush , and went on the prowl . His parents were at the far end of the corridor , on the front of the building . Madoc did n't bother going into their room . He could hear through the ill-fitting door his mother explaining in a portentous whisper what had happened , and his father replying calmly , " Do n't fret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled a little and touched his knuckles lightly to the door across from theirs . He got no reply , only an agreeable rhythmic , rumbling noise . He pushed open the door  --  there were no such refinements as locks up here  --  and saw two beds , each with a rather handsome male head on a far from handsome striped pillow tick . One head was fair , one was dark . One was snoring tenor , the other bass ; though Madoc could not be expected to know whether they were on pitch . It was a scene of perfect repose . Madoc surmised that men who sang opera and oratorio as oftenp45as Pitney and Kight did were accustomed to hearing loud soprano shrieks and could shut them out at will . He shut himself away from the two singers and moved on to the next room . A light tap was answered by an " ungh . " Madoc opened it and stuck his head in . Joe Ragovsky was awake , though just barely . The man in the other bed either was n't or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel , the oboist . No wonder Madoc had n't been able to remember what Gabriel looked like ; he had the kind of face that was designed to be instantly forgotten , and was quite wasted on a woodwind . It would have made a pickpocket 's or a swindler 's fortune . He said , " Sorry , wrong room , " and closed the door again . He tried the same tactic on the door across the hall , got no response , and opened it a crack , careful to lift up on the knob so the hinges would n't squeak . " Get out of here or I 'll yell the place down . " The voice was Corliss Blair 's . The clarinetist was sitting bolt upright , clutching two handfuls of blanket around her . She had a headful of pink foam rollers ; her pink flannel nightgown had a frill around the neck . It was a pity Lucy Shadd 's gown had n't one . Madoc stepped into the room and closed the door behind him . " Do n't bother , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I 'm sorry to barge in on you ladies , but my intentions are strictly honor-able . " " Shucks , " said Corliss , " I was afraid they might be . Sorry , Madoc , I thought you were one of the happiness boys . We 've already had to throw Cedric Rintoul out of here once . What 's up besides you ? " " There 's been an unfortunate incident down the hall . " " What sort of incident ? " " Somebody apparently tried to strangle Lucy Shadd with an A-string . " " Should have used a G-string , " mumbled a voice from under the blankets in the other bed . Helene Dufresne emerged slowly from her cocoon . " Good God , is it daylight already ? What time is breakfast ? " " Oh shush , Helene , " said Corliss . " Are n't you the least bit curious about who tried to murder Lucy ? " " No , I 'm curious about whose A-string they used . There was a D-string missing out of my cello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cello . You 're sure it 's not a D-string , Madoc ? They 're rather hard to tell apart if you are n't a string player yourself . " " I 'm not sure of anything . I thought at first it was just a piece of wire . Frieda Loye told me it was a violin A-string , but she did n't have her contacts in . Maybe you would n't mind giving me an expert opinion later on . " " I 'd be delighted . Is the string still around Lucy 's neck ? " " No , I found it on the floor under the bed . The assumption is that the assailant slipped the string around Lucy 's neck while she was still asleep , then crossed the ends over and pulled . " " What a splendid idea . Cheap and easy . Only I gather it did n't work . I 'm surprised Lucy let the person get away instead of showing him how it ought to be done . She does n't usually stand for inefficiency . So that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be Frieda having another nightmare . " " Frieda insists Lucy began screaming before she did , but Lucy claims it was Frieda 's screams that scared the intruder away . I suppose it 's possible Frieda did in fact have a nightmare at the opportune time and start yelling before she woke up . There 's a good deal of confusion as to the actual sequence of events . They both appear to have been sleeping very soundly when the room was entered . " " You talk like a policeman , " said Corliss . " That 's because I am a policeman . " " You 're kidding . I thought you must be a folk singer . " " No , I just need a haircut . In point of fact , I ca n't tell one note from another . " " That need n't prevent you from being a folk singer . " " I 'm afraid I would n't know . My tone-deafness is a greater affliction to my parents than it is to me , so perhaps you 'd be kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , my mother 's given me orders to find out who attacked Lucy Shadd and make him stop trying to kill people , so would you mind telling me whether you 've been aware of any homicidal maniacs strolling around the hallway during the past half hour or so ? " " Not offhand , no , " said Helene . " But then we have n't been watching . What do they look like ? " " Well , you see , that 's the problem . One ca n't always tell . Quite seri/ously , ladies , have you heard any stealthy footsteps , anything of that sort ? " " Lord , yes , stealthy footsteps by the bucketful . People have been stealthing all over the place , " Corliss replied . " Mostly in Delicia Fawn 's direction , as usual . " " Which is where ? " " Madoc , do n't try to tell us you have n't dropped in on her yourself ? " " My mother would n't let me . Come on , Corliss , left or right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious , are n't you ? " " That 's the impression I 've been endeavoring to convey . " " You 're really and truly a policeman ? " Madoc fished in his pocket and found one of his cards for her . " Detective Inspector , RCMP ? My gosh , what are you here for ? " " To spend a little time with my parents ; at least that was the idea when I came . I had to be in Wagstaffe on business , you see , and they thought it might be fun for me to join the company and snatch a free ride out to the festival . Now that we 've run into a spot of trouble , my mother 's decided I may as well make myself useful . So I 'll welcome any cooperation you 're willing to give me . " " You honestly believe somebody tried to murder Lucy Shadd just now ? " " There 's a nasty red mark around her throat that adds a certain credibility to the assumption . I should n't advise your going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's given her something to quiet her down . Frieda Loye has also expressed hope of getting a little sleep , though I do n't know how well she 's going to succeed . She seems a nervy sort of lady . " " I 'd be pretty darned nervy trying to sleep in a room where my bunkie 's just missed being strangled , " said Helene . " For Pete 's sake , Madoc , could n't you have found someplace else to put them ? " " That aspect of the matter did n't seem to bother them much , " Madoc replied . " And frankly , in a ramshackle old place like this , I do n't see that changing rooms would make much difference . I have a feeling Lucy was determined to tough it out and Frieda was reluctant to put anyone to the bother of switching . I understand she 's already caused some of you to miss a bit of sleep on your previous stops . " " I 'll say she has , " said Corliss . " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately . I do n't know why , she never did before . "  | " You 've worked with her for some time , then ? " " Oh yes , we principals are all old hands with the Wagstaffe . It 's one of Canada 's finest orchestras , as your parents must have told you , so once they hire us , we 're happy to stay on . You know , I suppose , that Lucy used to be principal horn player ? She bucked for Wilhelm to take her place when she had to retire . " Madoc gave the cellist one of his gentle smiles . " Retire sounds like an odd word for someone who works as hard as Lucy Shadd does . " Helene shrugged . Her nightgown was short-sleeved , and Madoc could see how muscular her arms were . " I know , but being on the staff is n't like being a member of the orchestra . I 'd hate getting shoved off the stage , myself . " " You 're safe enough , Helene , " said Corliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , but the strings go on forever . Look at Pablo Casals . " " Yes , " said Madoc , " why do n't you ? By the way , Helene , I was wondering how you happened to be on the plane last night ? I 'd been given to understand that the players usually preferred to travel with their instruments . You did n't bring your cello with you ? " " No , it 's on the train , where I thought I was supposed to be . They 'd already taken away the instrument cases and I was getting on the bus when Lucy ran up and told me I was on the list for the plane . God knows why , I loathe flying . I assumed it was some sort of mixup , but Lucy 's been having such a hellish time trying to do two jobs that I did n't want to make a fuss . Besides , I have a favorite cousin in Vancouverand it looked like my chance to grab some free time with her . You just ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that way . But my mother is counting on me to find her a clue , so I 'd better get cracking . Thank you for your help , ladies . If you 'd like a wash , there 's hot water in the kitchen . " They did n't want a wash . They wanted to go back to sleep , as who could blame them ? Funny ladies , Madoc thought ; they had n't shown much interest in what had happened to Lucy Shadd . Perhaps they had n't really believed him ; maybe they were still so traumatized by their own near-miss from being killed on the plane that a failed attempt at a murder down the hall seemed trivial by comparison . It might simplybe that they felt Lucy Shadd as staff did n't merit the same concern that she would have if she were still principal horn player.  |p49Or  maybe Helene and Corliss just did n't like Lucy Shadd . Maybe her officiousness annoyed everybody else the way it had got under Madoc 's own skin last night . That was one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried another experimental rap . Nobody was home . A beautiful dark blue suit with an ever so faint pinstripe was hung with great care over the back of the one wooden chair , a black cashmere overcoat across two hooks on the wall . An initialed calfskin carryall stood beside the chair , an expensive shaving kit and a black homburg hat reposed on the stained and battered dresser top . The bed had been neatly made up , but nobody was lying in it . Madoc cocked an eyebrow and continued his explorations . The neighboring room was empty of inhabitants but far from unused . Both beds were a mess of rumpled blankets and shed garments . The floor and dresser were strewn with objects ranging from an empty vodka bottle to an old-fashioned shaving brush and mug to a toy windupmouse that was a pretty good imitation of the real thing except , of course , for the key in its backside . Madoc did n't need the two open instrument cases to inform him that this had to be where the trumpeter and the trombonist had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't in the room occupied by the sleeping Lucy Shadd and the wide-awake Frieda Loye . Madoc met the flautist 's horrified stare with a reassuring nod . " Just checking , " he murmured , and backed out , closing the door with exaggerated care , not that he supposed it mattered much . In the room beyond , he discovered the missing concertmaster , slumberingpeacefully in a double bed beside the opulent Madame Bellini . Both Monsieur Houdon and his lady were wearing flannel pajamas , silk eyeshades , and fuzzy white earplugs . L ' amour , toujours l'amour . So by the process of elimination , Delicia Fawn must be at the far end of the hall . And so she was , looking ravishing in her sleep . And so was Steve MacVittie , looking ravished . And so were Cedric Rintoul and Jason Jasper , wearing surgical masks and tiger-striped pajamas with feet in them , standing one on either side of the bed with their instrumentsraised to the approximate presumed location of their lips . " Rehearsing a matinatta , gentlemen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delicia , and she began to speak . What she said was not nice . It was not genteel , it was not comme it faut , and it was just as well her next-door neighbors had their earplugs in . But shep50got her point across . Boiled down , it amounted to , " You unspeakable persons , get out of here . " Madoc raised his hand to stem the flow . " Before we leave , Miss Fawn , I should perhaps explain that I 'm here in my professional capacityas a detective inspector of the RCMP . My duty at the moment is to investigate a murderous assault which was made a short time ago upon Lucy Shadd , who is occupying the room two doors away from yours . May I ask how long you and Mr. MacVittie have been in one another 's company ? " Steve MacVittie was slowly coming to life . " Assault , huh ? " he grunted through a jaw-cracking yawn . " Is that what all the yelling was about down the hall a while back ? Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have n't had strength enough to leave . But these guys were n't . " " We were so , eh , " Rintoul protested . " You just could n't see us . We were hiding . " " Where , for instance ? " MacVittie 's question was a good one . There was n't even a closet , just a few hooks screwed into an unpainted board on the wall opposite the bed . " We were under the bed , " said Jason Jasper . Madoc stooped and checked . " You were not , Mr. Jasper . This is an old-fashioned coil spring and it sags in the middle . Mr. MacVittie is a big man and Miss Fawn is not puny , either ; therefore it sags a good deal . You and Mr. Rintoul are no lightweights yourselves , I may point out . The combined weight of the occupants is pushing the mattress and spring down so low that neither one of you would have been able to crawl underneath , much less the pair of you together . Added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed . Come on , Mr. Jasper , what else have you and your pal been up to ? Did you also think it would be a jolly jape to scare Lucy Shadd within an inch of her life ? " " God , no ! Why 'd we do a thing like that ? " " Perhaps for the same reason that Mr. Rintoul amused himself by tickling Frieda Loye 's neck with a piece of violin string taped to his trombone all through last evening 's concert , knowing full well that Mrs. Loye was subject to screaming nightmares as a result of previous teasing , and would probably wake up everybody tonight with another one . " With the exception of Monsieur Houdon and Madame Bellini , who'dp51have been wearing their earplugs , but Madoc saw no reason to go into that . " It was in fact a piece of violin string , was it not , Mr. Rintoul ? " " What 's the big deal about a piece of violin string ? " Rintoul was trying to be truculent , but he 'd forgotten he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he missed his effect . He snatched off the mask and snarled at Madoc . " And how come this crap about being a Mountie ? I thought you were Sir Emlyn 's son . " " The two are not mutually exclusive , Mr. Rintoul . " " Lady Rhys told me you worked for the Canadian government . " Jason Jasper sounded like a petulant four-year-old . " In research . " " That is quite correct , Mr. Jasper . On behalf of the law enforcement branch of the Canadian government , I am at present researching you . Getting back to my question , Mr. Rintoul , was it in fact a piece of violin string you were using to torture Mrs. Loye ? " " I resent the use of the word torture . " Madoc did n't respond to his resentment , merely stood and waited . Delicia Fawn was in no mood for passivity . " Cedric , do n't be such a jackass . So what about it , Madoc ? Or do we have to call you Inspector now ? What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Call me what you please . What 's important about a violin string is that a piece of one was used by somebody trying to strangle Lucy Shadd . Where did you get your string , Mr. Rintoul ? " " I 'm not saying I had one . " " If you do n't , one of your colleagues will , " Madoc pointed out . " It 's not possible that none of the other members of the orchestra noticed what you were up to . My mother and I could see it quite plainly from where we were sitting . You 'll be hearing from my father on the subject of unprofessional behavior , I expect , but we 're not concerned with that just now . Talk , Mr. Rintoul. "  |p52The  trombonist did a bit of snorting and snuffling , then shrugged his heavy shoulders . " Oh , all right . What the hell , guys like you could n't see a joke if it waltzed up and jumped on their corns . It was a hunk of violin string I found on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where is it now ? " asked Madoc . " How the hell do I know ? I threw it away . " " No you did n't , Ceddie , " Jason Jasper contradicted eagerly . " It 's still in your case . I noticed when you put your instrument away . " " Thanks , pal . " " Go and get it , will you please , Mr. Jasper ? " Madoc could perfectly well have gone himself , but he felt like staying here and making Rintoul sweat a little more . Rintoul was shuffling his tiger-striped feet , looking silly and no doubt feeling even sillier . " What 's the big deal ? " he mumbled . " I just thought it would be a handy thing to tickle somebody with . " " The somebody being , of course , Frieda Loye . " " Sure , because she was the one who happened to be sitting in front of me last night . Big deal ! If it had n't been Frieda , it would have been somebody else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have felt the tickling through his shirt collar . There were n't all that many women in the orchestra , and not all their gowns were identically cut . Mrs. Loye wore one that was perfectly designed for tickling , though I do n't suppose she thought of that when she chose it . " Jasper was back with the trombone case only a few seconds after he 'd gone . He must be anxious to make points with the law . Rintoul obviously was n't . As for MacVittie and Miss Fawn , Madoc could n't tellp53whether they were even still awake . It must have been quite an audition , but that was none of his business . " Open the case , please , Mr. Rintoul . " Grunting something scurrilous under his breath , the musician obeyed . There lay his trombone , gleaming like a horn of gold , still sporting that wisp of whisker at the nethermost curve of its slide . Madoc could see now that it was a stiffish piece of what still looked to him like wire , about four inches long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this all the string you found , Mr. Rintoul , or did you cut it from a longer piece ? " " I shortened it . What the hell , I only needed a little bit . " " Just enough to reach from your slide to Mrs. Loye 's collarbone . What did you shorten it with ? " " A little Mickey Mouse jackknife I had in my pocket , " he mumbled . " I always carry it . " " Along with your exploding cigars and your whoopee cushion , no doubt . And what did you do with the rest of the string ? " " How the hell do I know ? I most likely dropped it where I 'd found it . Or else I stuck it in the pocket of my tailcoat , in which case it 's still there and you can see it for yourself once we catch up with the wardrobetrunks , if we ever do . So get off my back before I report you to the Musicians ' Union . " " I do n't come under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , since you and Mr. Jasper here were in fact not hiding under Miss Fawn 's bed , when Mrs. Loye and Mrs. Shadd began to scream , where were you ? " " Oh , for God 's sake ! We were trying to get a rise out of Delicia , that 's all . Actually , we were in our own room across the hall when we heard the yelling . We thought it was just Frieda having another nightmare . " " As a result of your harmless little prank last night ? " " Jeez , you never let up on a guy , do you ? We were sort of wondering if we ought to get up and do something to quiet her down . Then we heard Lady Rhys coming down the hall so we thought we 'd better not butt in . Then you came along . " " How do you know I did ? " asked Madoc . " Were you watching through the keyhole ? "  | " Cripes , we did n't have to . The door in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fist through , " Jasper put in . " Yeah . " Rintoul might n't have wanted to talk , but he was n't about to let Jasper take the floor . " So anyway , once we were up it did n't seem worth going back to bed , so we waited till things had quieted down and you and your mother had gone back up the hall . Then we thought what the hell , we 'd drop in and play reveille for Delicia and her new boyfriend . Kind of cheer things up a little , you know . We saw you sneaking into Helene and Corliss 's room and we were going to serenade you next . Only I guess we sort of misjudged what you were going for , eh ? " Madoc was not amused . Rintoul , at last , was abashed . " What the hell , Inspector , I 'm sorry . You think we got a little bit out of line , eh ? " " Tell me something , Mr. Rintoul , do you wear contact lenses ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it . " Huh ? Hell , no . Why should I ? " " I was just curious , " Madoc replied . Actually , he 'd been thinking back to that scene in the other bedroom . Even now , it was n't quite full daylight . When he 'd responded to the two women 's cries , the room had been barely light enough to see one 's way around . Lucy Shadd and Frieda Loye were both on the thin side , neitherof them young . Both wore their graying hair in the neat , short cut that was favored by the majority of professional women . Lucy was a few inches taller than the diminutive Frieda , but that difference would n't show up in bed . In a poor light it might n't have been difficult to mix them up . Was it possible that the strangler had left his task unfinished not because Frieda screamed , but because he 'd caught on just in time that he was trying to kill the wrong woman ? Madoc knew he had a fat chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivably involve them in so totally unfunnya caper . They must realize they 'd already set themselves up as prime suspects . " All right , you two comedians , " he told them . " I suggest you apologizeto Miss Fawn and Mr. MacVittie . Then you either go back to your room and stay there or else come downstairs where I can keep an eye on you . " " What 's downstairs ? " said Jasper . " Any chance of something to eat ? "  | " There should be hot water to wash in , at any rate . " The fires must not have gone out ; otherwise the upstairs would be colder than it was . " And I expect we can scare up some sort of breakfast . Can any of you four cook ? " They all not only insisted they could n't , they seemed proud of their inability . Madoc sighed and went downstairs . He could have asked to borrow Rintoul 's or Jasper 's razor , he supposed . On the other hand , anything belonging to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noises or else squirted cheap perfume up his nose . Give him a rogue instead of a fool any day in the week . There was no bread in the kitchen , but there was flour . There were powdered eggs and powdered milk . There was baking powder , there was salt , there was cooking oil . There were cans of Spam and jugs of syrup . Madoc tried to think what Janet would do in a case like this , and did it . The batter bore a reasonable resemblance to Janet 's . At least it was worth a try ; he suddenly realized that he was totally ravenous . He sliced himself a frying pan full of Spam . He greased a griddle and poured out two neat , round blobs for flapjacks . They bubbled up nicely ; he turned them over . They were browned just the way he liked them . He was about to fill himself a plate when Steve MacVittie entered the kitchen , limping slightly . " God , Madoc , that smells like the breath of angels . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard night 's work ? " " Sure thing , Mac . " What else could Madoc say ? " Here , take these . I 'll fix myself some more . " He sliced up the rest of the Spam and greased the griddle anew . He fried four pancakes this time because Steve was making awfully quick work of those first two . Apparently he 'd guessed right on the recipe . Janet would be proud of him , if he ever got to tell her . He used some of his hot water to make a big pot of tea , and set out sugar and dried milk . There were restaurant-size cans of peaches , the old sourdough 's staple , on the kitchen shelves . Madoc thought some of those might be a welcome addition to the feast he was still hoping to get some of . Before he could take down a can , much less get it open , Ed Naxton was on deck looking hopeful . Smiling on the outside and growling on the in/side , Madoc gave Ed the second breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter , and opened two more cans of Spam . It was as well he 'd done so . Perhaps it would have been better if he 'd never started this breadline in the first place . Rintoul and Jasper appeared , unabashed and wearing false noses with mustaches attached . The mustaches were reddish and droopy , much like the one Madoc himself had shaved off when it began to get in the way of his relationship with Janet . He wished to God Janet were here . She could cook and he could eat . He cut more Spam and kept on frying . Helene Dufresne and Corliss Blair came down with Joe Ragovsky and the still silent David Gabriel , then Carlos Pitney , who offered to open the peaches if Madoc would show him how to work the can opener . Madoc said sorry , he did n't have time . Helene did know how , or so she claimed , but she did n't dare make the attempt and risk cutting her finger . Uncut fingers were , she explained , vital to a cellist 's ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was thinking of . Madoc took a short break from flapjack flipping and opened the peaches . He was just thinking he might snatch a bite for himself when AinsworthKight swam into view , reeking of charm and throat spray and clamoring for honey to put in his tea . There was no honey . Helene suggested pancake syrup , which seemed to work just as well . Naturally , however , Ainsworth then demanded pancakes to go with his syrup . Madoc opened all the Spam he could find and mixed a great deal more batter . For the first time since they 'd been grounded , the atmosphere among the company had become downright bonhomous . Nobody was in any hurry to leave the warmth of the stove and the geniality of his fellows . They did get cramped for space around the table ; in fact the entire kitchen got pretty congested as people kept coming and dragging in more chairs . Madoc had barely space enough to mix batter , open cans , replenish the teapot , cook the food , and add more wood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , he 'd more or less given up on that notion . He fried on and on , gaining what satisfaction he could from the odors of flapjack and Spam and the sounds of munching jaws . Madame Bellini alone kept him busy for quite a while , nor was MonsieurHoudon backward in coming forward with his plate , even though he did express a wistful preference for jambon d moutarde de Dijon over Spam . Both he and Madame Bellini looked quite understandably restedp57and refreshed . They 'd entered the room a decorous ten minutes apart , each expressing a courteous hope that the other had slept well . Both had replied in the affirmative . Madoc was not surprised . Lady Rhys came down in her gorgeous housecoat to get a pitcher of hot water for Sir Emlyn to shave with . She cast a reproving look at her son 's dark-shadowed cheeks as her pitcher was being passed from hand to hand over the heads of the assembled multitudes so that Madoc could fill it from the boiler on the stove . She took the water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived with Sir Emlyn , both of them scrubbed and shiny and properly garbed for a morning in the country in well-worn tweeds . Helene Dufresne offered to set a small table in the lobby for them , but they said not to bother , they 'd just join the party in the kitchen . It became apparent , however , that the party was n't going to join them . People began remembering they still needed to wash and dress . Pitchers were brought , water was taken , the tumult and the shouting died , and in the firebox sank the fire . Madoc shoved in another stick or two , scraped the last of the batter from the bowl , and made himself one extra-large pancake . " Good heavens , Madoc , " his mother expostulated , " you 're not planning to sit at the table in front of your father with whiskers all over your face ? " " Yes , Mother , I am , " he told her . " I 'm just the hired man around here , do n't forget . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind , Tad . Mine 's somewhere in the bowels of the plane . " Lady Rhys sniffed at the deliberate indelicacy of bowels , but went on eating her pancakes and peaches . Sir Emlyn smiled shyly at this interestingyoung chap he so inexplicably had sired , and helped himself to another slice of Spam . " Have n't had any of this since 1944 , " he remarked . " Tastes about the same , do n't you think , Sillie ? " For some reason Madoc doubted he 'd ever understand , Lady Rhys wiped her lips on one of the paper napkins Madoc had unearthed from the supply closet , and gave her husband a fond and emphatic kiss right in front of Frieda Loye , who was at last putting in an apologetic appearancewith her empty enamel pitcher . The flautist stepped back in **25;16558;TOOLONG  | " Oh , I beg your pardon . I did n't mean to interrupt a family break-fast . " " You have n't . " Madoc got up and pulled out a chair for her . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in some peaches and Spam ? I 'm afraid the pancake batter 's all used up , but I can easily throw together another batch . " " Please do n't bother on my account . I could n't eat a thing , honestly . " " Then you must at least have a cup of tea , " said Lady Rhys . Frieda Loye replied faintly that tea would be lovely , but Lucy wasawake and wanted to wash . " She 'll have dozed off again by now , I expect , " Lady Rhys insisted . " That 's how those pills always work with me . Sit down here and drink this tea . " Frieda could hardly do anything then except obey . She made a decent pretense of drinking the mugful Lady Rhys had poured out for her , and managed half a slice of peach at her ladyship 's earnest best that she needed something to keep her strength up . However , this was clearly a struggle . As soon as she could manage without being positively rude , she made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhyses looked after her with real concern . " There 's something more wrong with that woman than getting tickledwith a violin string , " Sir Emlyn observed as he chased the last bite of Spam around his otherwise empty plate . " I 'm wondering whether she may be afraid the strangler picked the wrong bed , " said Madoc . " Madoc , that 's really penetrating of you . More tea , anyone ? " Lady Rhys peered into the depleted pot , shook her head sadly , and set it down on the plate that had been pressed into service as a trivet . " I must say I 've been wondering the same thing . Lucy Shadd seems such an unlikely victim . Not that I have n't felt like strangling her myself once or twice , and you may make of that what you please . " " But how could we replace her on such short notice ? " Sir Emlyn pointed out . " And who 'd do the work if she were n't around ? " " I know , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's what 's so scary , do n't you think ? It 's a shocking thing for me to say , I know , but I 'd be easier in my mind if it had been Frieda . She 's a born victim , you see , whereas Lucy 's just the opposite . And that must mean a totally undiscriminating murderer , would n't you say ? A psy/chopath , I believe they 're called ? They used to be just loonies when I was a girl , but I understand nowadays that 's not considered quite nice . Some crazed desert rat , perhaps , who just happened to wander by in a bad mood . " " We 're not in the desert , Sillie , " her husband pointed out . " A frustrated prospector , then . It 's got to be someone , Emmy . " " Someone other than ourselves , you mean . I understand your feelings , Sillie , but we must n't jump to conclusions . What do the others say , Madoc ? " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corliss Blair do . They caught me breaking into their room when I was checking around to see who was where , and I had to explain my way out . Those two jokers from the brass section know , also . I caught them with Steve MacVittie , the pilot , in Delicia Fawn 's room . " " Good heffens , was she running an orgy ? " " Not quite . " Madoc described the unedifying but hardly orgiastic circumstances in which he 'd found the four of them . " Anyway , nobody said anything about the incident at breakfast . I do n't know whether they were waiting for me to speak first , which I did n't have time to do ; whether they were trying to pretend it had n't happened ; or whether the word simply had n't gotten around . " " Orchestras are hotbeds of gossip usually , " Lady Rhys observed . " Helene and Corliss have struck me as being decent sorts , though ; they may have kept their mouths shut on principle . And I doubt whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly concern her-self . " " Good point , Mother , " said Madoc . " Steve MacVittie would no doubt have been embarrassed to bring the subject up , considering how he 'd learned the news . As for Rintoul and Jasper , they had every reason to stay off it . Right now , they 've set themselves up quite neatly as prime suspects . " " That 's a bit of all right as far as I 'm concerned , " said Lady Rhys . " The less said , the less panic , do n't you think ? Now I expect I 'd better take something up to poor Lucy . The rest of those peaches ought to slip down easily . Too bad there 's no pretty sauce dish to put them in . These thick little bowls make me think of Aunt Oldrys bathing her canary . Ah well , what ca n't be cured must be endured with equanimity . And tea , of course . Is there a speck of hot water left , Madoc ? "  | " Just about . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing up , had n't you ? Thanks , dear . " Lady Rhys blew a kiss in the general direction of her son 's right ear and went off with Lucy 's breakfast , such as it was , on a tray . Madoc and his father exchanged shrugs , picked up a bucket apiece , and went over to the pump.  | " Why do n't we simply bung all the dishes into the copper and let the water boil up around them ? " Sir Emlyn appeared to be quite taken with himself in the role of scullery boy . " And should n't soap come into it somewhere ? It seems to me there used to be a little wire cage one swished through the washingupwater . One put the leftover bits of soap in it , if one had any . One did n't always , in wartime . I believe there was also ground-up soap in a box one shook some out of . " " Nowadays one usually has a plastic bottle that squirts , " said Madoc . " I 'll tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tins so they wo n't draw varmints ? Use one of the buckets , and dump the water out on the ground . If we let it go down the sink , it will probably freeze there and bust the pipes , and we 're fairly well into the depredations already . " " I 'll squash them fiat . " Sir Emlyn was really warming up to his new job . " That will thwart the varmints good and proper . By the way , son , not to be indelicate but what are we going to do about what my old nanny used to call the vahses ? " " We let everybody cope with his or her own , " said Madoc firmly . " I had n't given it much thought , Tad ; what would you suggest ? Have people holler gardy loo ' and chuck it out the upstairs window in the Edinburgh tradition ? Or dig a decent-sized hole to empty them into and throw earth on top ? " " The latter course seems the less objectionable . Very well , son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging . It would n't do for me to sprain a shoulder on the way to the festival , assuming we ever get there . " " Oh , we will . Our plane must have been reported overdue by now . I expect there 's a search on already . "  | " But how will the searchers know where to look ? We did n't go the route we were intended to , you know . " Madoc did n't have to be reminded . " If we had , we 'd have been found already , though possibly not in the best of shape . This way , it will simply take a bit longer . " " Of course , son . We must count our blessings . Here , I can do that . Why do n't you nip on upstairs and get yourself shaved ? We have to maintain the dignity of my position , you know . " Sir Emlyn permitted himself a sly chuckle as he tied a tea towel around his waist for an apron and began to scrape the plates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pitcher , and went upstairs . His mother was not in the parental bedroom . She must be down the hall comforting the afflicted . It was as well she was not in the kitchen having a fainting fit at the sight of her distinguished husband in his present occupation . Actually , Sir Emlyn was showing his usual expert leadership , Madoc realized . Once it got about that the maestro himself was pitching in with the dog work , there might be less of the cut finger routine and more shoulders to the wheel . And a damned good thing , too . Madoc had no inclination to remain the lone skivvy for whatever the duration of their stay might be . He was lathering his chin with his father 's shaving cream when Lady Rhys came back . " Madoc , whatever are you doing here ? " " Shaving , Mother . We have Tad 's position to think of , you know . " " But what about the washing-up ? And where is your father ? " " Washing dishes . How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her throat 's not so sore . She has it wrapped up in a scarf and says the warmth is doing some good . Lucy 's taking it wonderfully well , I have to say . Some women would be totally shattered . Madoc , what did you say your father was doing ? " " The washing-up , Mother . As soon as he finishes that , we 're going to dig a latrine out back to dump the slops into . " " Madoc , dear , I realize it 's incumbent upon all of us to keep our spirits up during this difficult time , but I must tell you that I find your attempts at humor a trifle coarse for my personal taste . Is your father planning to call a rehearsal ? " " He did n't say . He was busy squashing tins so the varmints wo n't get them . Listen , Mother , do you hear that ? "  |p63Actually  , there was a great deal to hear since most of the party were still in their bedrooms : splashing and swearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; lamenting the lack of electricity for their razors , scalp massagers , garment steamers , curling irons , and mechanical toothbrushes ; running through their scales ; or , as in Ainsworth Kight 's case , spraying their throats . From far over the hubbub , however , came the unmistakable drone of an airplane engine . And from the interior of the hotel came a mass pounding of feet as the castaways abandoned whatever they were doing and raced pell-mell down the stairs , and out into the road . Still plying his father 's razor , Madoc watched from the front window as they waved their arms , musicalinstruments , throat sprayers , and in one case a ruffled crimson pettiskirt . That was Delicia Fawn , standing there in an off-the-shoulder Carmen-style blouse and practically nothing else . If she did n't fetch that plane down , nothing would . " Look at that idiot woman ! She 'll catch a cold and be hoarse as a frog for the festival , " fumed Lady Rhys . " Here , Madoc , for goodness ' sake take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Madoc scraped off what he hoped was the final inch of whiskers , splashed in the basin to dissolve any clinging smears of lather , rubbed his face dry on the first towel he could lay hands on , and ran downstairs to join the welcoming committee . He was just in time to witness the landing , which was a remarkably bad one . The plane bucked and bounced and seesawed like a kid 's teeter-totter , and almost smacked into the grounded Grumman before it finally joggled to a safe stop . " My God , who 's that ? The Wright brothers ? " That was Ed Naxton , and his question was a valid one . Not many of those present had ever laid eyes on an open-cockpit triplane , or any kind of triplane , for that matter . That anybody could be flying such an antiquated crate among the treacherous downdrafts of this mountainousarea was a matter for wonderment . None of the watchers was at all surprised when the pilot climbed out over the left lower wing wearing jodhpurs with big patches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Lucky Lindy helmet with the chinstraps dangling , cracked and blurred goggles , and a once-white scarf wound four or five times around his neck and still having plenty of frayed ends left to trail in the ap/proved manner . This magnificent man in his flying machine did in fact appear to be male , and he was alone . Madoc 's first thought was that this must be one of the turns they put on for the tourists at the ghost town . The pilot was gazing over the assemblage : Delicia , now cocooned in Lady Rhys 's blanket , accepting a squirt of throat spray from Ainsworth Kight ; Jason Jasper and Cedric Rintoul with their respective trumpet and trombone to their lips , tootinga snatch of " Come , Josephine , in My Flying Machine " ; Madame Bellini and Jacques-Marie Houdon dignified and impassive ; Joe Ragovskyand all the rest bouncing with excitement , except for David Gabriel , who remained totally blank . The newcomer took off his helmet , presumably so that he could scratch his head . Then he put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over to check out the tussocky ground , and finally sat on the wing with his legs dangling . His apparent intention was to let himself down , but it was easy to see why he was hesitating . The drop was maybe five feet , no jump at all for a young man ; but this chap was seventy if he was a day . Ed and Steve had already caught on to his dilemma and were on their way to lend him a hand , so Madoc stayed with the waiters . As the triplane 's pilot approached , hobbling between Ed and Steve , Madoc judged seventy to have been a conservative estimate . This gaffer could n't be one of the Wright brothers , but he might conceivably have patronized their bicycle shop in his youth . He could even have bought the parts for his flying machine there , from what Madoc could see of it . At least he was n't bashful . He walked straight up to the group in front of the Miners ' Rest , tilted back his head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane crash ? " Sir Emlyn was with them now . He 'd forgotten to take the dish towel from around his waist and Madoc had n't seen fit to remind him . Lady Rhys , last to appear ( except of course for Lucy Shadd , who had n't come at all ) , whisked the thing out of sight and gave her son one of those exasperated looks he 'd been hoping he 'd seen the last of . The towel would n't have made any difference ; Sir Emlyn was Sir Emlyn no matter what . He stepped forward and addressed the inquirer . " How do you do , sir ? I am Emlyn Rhys , and these are members of the Wagstaffe Symphony Orchestra . We are on our way to the Fraser River Music Festival ; our plane had to make a forced landing here lastp65night . Are we fortunate enough to discover that you have come looking for us ? " " You sure as shootin ' are , pardner . Ace Bulligan 's my name an ' flyin'smy game . Any casualties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. MacVittie here . However , we are without power to continue our journey and also with no means of communication , so we 're most grateful to you for coming to our rescue . How did you know where to find us ? " " Smart flyin ' or dumb luck , dependin ' on how you look at it . 01 ' Moxie Mabel had a little juice in ' er so I thought I might 's well go up an ' take a look around , but she wo n't climb too good so all 's I could do was comb the flatlands , of which there ai n't none to speak of around here , ' cept Lodestone Flat , which is where you 're standin ' now in case you did n't know . I smelt your smoke an ' knowed the Miners ' Rest was bunged up tight shut for the winter so when I seen your plane settin ' down in front of ' er , I figured I must o ' found the missin ' murderers . " " Murderers ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , we are musicians . " " You do n't have to tell me twice , mister . I ai n't deaf . Not that deaf , anyhow . You 're the buggers who done in some other poor son of a bitch that played the coronet . " " Do you mean cornet ? What cornet ? The cornet is primarily a band instrument . We do n't use them all that much in orchestral music . " " You could n't prove it by me , mister . Maybe it was a kazoo or a bugle . Like them things them two buzzards over there is carryin ' . You ai n't kiddin ' me none for all your hifalutin ' talk . You did n't even shoot ' im down like a white man . You bunged ' im full o ' some kind o ' fancy rat pizen an ' left ' im to drown in his own puke while you made your darin ' escape in that there flyin ' saloon over there . I heard it on the six o'clock news this mornin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madoc thought he might as well horn in here , since his father was looking decidedly out of his element . " This cornet player you 're talking about , was he in fact a French-horn player , and was his name Wilhelm Ochs ? " " Yeah , that 's him . Dead as a strung-up rustler in front o ' three millionpeople . " " Three million ? " " Well , three thousand . Three hundred . Three somethin ' . What differ/ence does it make ? Dead 's dead , ai n't it ? You look like kind of a sneaky little cuss to me . You the one that slipped ' im the pizen ? " No , but I 'm the cuss who 's going to pinch you for flying an unregisteredplane , Madoc thought of replying . It was inconceivable that such an agglomeration of baling wire and wishful thinking could have passed any sort of inspection within the past thirty years . However , Ace Bulliganwas at the moment their only hope of a linkup with the outside world , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ochs was a member of the orchestra which Sir Emlyn Rhys here is conducting , " he explained in as unsneaky a manner as he could manage . " He became ill during last night 's performance , collapsedbackstage after the concert was over , and died just before the ambulance arrived to take him to the hospital . He 'd been having serious problems with his stomach for quite some time and it was assumed at the time we left that he 'd died of natural causes . Otherwise , we should n't have been allowed to leave . If you have definite information that Mr. Ochs was poisoned , we naturally want to know the details . Can you remember exactly what was said on the radio ? " " Who 's askin ' ? " " Oh , sorry . My name is Madoc Rhys . Sir Emlyn is my father and Lady Rhys over there in the tweed coat and skirt is my mother . " " Lady Rhys , huh ? Howdy , ma'am . " Ace Bulligan raised his goggles and then his helmet by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lil worked at the Miners ' Rest . She wore black silk stockings an ' pink satin bloomers . Seen much o ' the Queen lately ? " " Not since shortly after Christmas , " Lady Rhys answered quite matter-of-factly . " Her Majesty was in excellent health and spirits at that time , I may say . " " Well , next time you run into ' Er Majesty , tell ' er Ace Bulligan says hello . What 's a titled lady like you doin ' with a bunch o ' sidewinders like these here , if you do n't mind my askin ' ? " " They are not sidewinders , Mr. Bulligan , and I can assure you that Her Majesty would take an extremely dim view of your calling them rude names . " Lady Rhys had flipped open her lorgnette to give him a reproving glare , but she thought better of it just in time and switched to an ingratiatingsmile . " Now , would you please answer my son 's question ? We are all deeply grieved over the death of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may have been the victim of foul play . " " No maybe about it , ma'am . Accordin ' to what I heard on the news , somebody fed ' im castor oil . " " Castor oil would n't have killed him ! It would have "  --  Lady Rhys paused momentarily  --  " produced somewhat different symptoms from those he evinced last night . " " Well , it was n't just castor oil . It was something like castor oil . With rice in it . Seems to me it was the rice that done ' im in . " " Ricin , " said Madoc . " Of course . Ricin is what kills children who chew on the beans from the castor oil plant . They have a delayed reaction , sometimes several hours , sometimes a day or more . Ochs was n't a health food freak , by any chance ? " " Hell , no , " said Joe Ragovsky . " He was a food freak , period . Bill liked his grub . What does this ricin taste like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too eager to find out , " said Madoc , " but I ca n't imagine it 's too awful if kids eat the beans . You have to chew them to get the poisoning effect , otherwise they just slip through the digestive system intact . If you were to run a few through a food mill and mix the resulting mash with something spicy , I suppose you could get your intended victim to ingest a dose that would do the job . The kicker would be , you see , that he would n't know he 'd had any . He would n't relate his symptoms to what he 'd eaten because so much time had passed . By the time he began to feel sick , he 'd already be in serious trouble , as Ochs plainly was for quite some time before he managed to get offstage . " " I ought to have noticed , " mourned Sir Emlyn . " I doubt whether your noticing would have made any difference , Tad . Ochs was clearly determined to tough it out . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't by any chance have a two-way radio in your plane ? " " You kiddin ' ? I ai n't even sure I got an engine . " " Then how about a battery that we might borrow in the hope it would operate the hotel 's radio ? " " Huh . Mister , the only radio I own 's one o ' them weeny pocket transistor kind an ' the batteries is about the size o ' my little finger . An ' it 's in my shack about fifty miles from here an ' I do n't even know if Ip68got juice enough in my tank to get home , never mind bring the clang thing back here . " " We could siphon some fuel out of our emergency tank for you , " Steve MacVittie offered . " Though I 'm afraid it might not  --  " His gaze drifted over to the tattered wreck parked too near the Grumman , and his voice faltered into stillness . " Might not ? You can bet your last two bits it might not , brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured one little slug o ' them highvoltageatom squeezin 's you burn into my of Moxie Mabel ? She 'd go straight into orbit an ' come down about a teaspoonful o ' rust an ' sawdust , that 's what . " " Then what do you run her on ? Just regular gasoline , like a lawn tractor ? " " I do when I can get it . Mostly I run ' er on homemade alcohol . I got a little what you might call a  --  " " Still ? " Madoc suggested . " I was going to say processin ' plant . Anyways , that 's what she 's used to an ' she do n't seem to mind it none . " " There 's liquor on the plane , " said Ed Naxton . " I doubt if it 's as powerful as the stuff you make , but we could try . " A smile of wonderful radiance overspread the old flyer 's grizzled features . " Never can tell , pardner . You just trot ' er out , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd made a terrible mistake . Madoc had realized that as soon as the old aviator reacted to that magic word , liquor . It was too late now ; Ace Bulligan was testing . " I got to find out whether this hooch is compatible with the stuff I been usin ' , ai n't I ? And there 's only one way to do that . " The two-liter bottle was large , but Bulligan 's thirst must be larger still . He was glugging down genuine Russian vodka straight from the bottle 's mouth , barely stopping to swallow . It was downright scary to watch . " Mr. Bulligan . " Madoc thought he 'd better try to find out all he could while the old soak was still conscious . " Have you a map in the plane ? " " Map ? " Bulligan took the neck of the bottle out of his mouth long enough to catch his breath and consider the question . " What the hell would I want a map for ? Us old-timers fly by the seat of our pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Here , have a slug on me . " Madoc shook his head . " Not just now , thanks . I 'd like to know where we are . " " I told you where you are . You 're here , damn it . " " Yes , but I 'd like to make the location a bit more precise . Where are we in relation , say , to Calgary or Edmonton ? " " You ai n't noplace near either one of ' em . Try me on Bickerdike . " " All right then , what about Bickerdike ? " " You ai n't noplace near there , neither . I just like the name . " " Then what town are we near ? In other words , Mr. Bulligan , where might one reasonably hope to find a telephone or a two-way radio by means of which we can call for somebody to come and get us out of here ? "  | " What the hell do you want to leave for ? You just got here . Let ' em know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This ai n't a bad place to hide out , an ' I do n't mind havin ' a little company for a change . Gets kind of quiet up here alone in the wintertime . I hibernate , mostly . " " But you must need to get in supplies now and then , " Madoc persisted . " Where do you buy your food ? " " None o ' your goddamned business . I ai n't givin ' out no information to no smartass murderer that 's too goddamned stuck up to take a drink with me . Git out o ' my sight , you mangy coyote , or I 'll bean you with this bottle . Come on , you other two ornery sidewinders , I 'll take on the whole goddamned kit an ' boiling of you . Put up your dukes ! " " Not to be inhospitable , old-timer , " drawled Ed Naxton , " but that 's our vodka you 're drinking . " " Then I better quick drink some more before you snatch it back , eh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle away , Bulligan had taken one last , mighty gulp and gone out like a light . Steve MacVittie snorted . " Fat lot of help he turned out to be . Now what do we do ? " " Wait for somebody sober to come along , I suppose , " Madoc told him . " Is there any hope of your finding out what 's wrong with the Grumman ? " " Not a hell of a lot , but we can try . See , those old-time crates like Bulligan 's were so simply constructed that you did n't need to be any great mechanic to repair whatever needed fixing . Though old Ace here must be either a wizard or else the biggest damned fool going to have kept that mess of rags and rot in the air all this time , " Steve conceded . " But the planes we fly nowadays are so damned complicated that you have to be a trained mechanic even to make any sense out of how they 're put together . I do n't know , Madoc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not making you any promises . And I 'll tell you another thing ; I 'm not going up in that crate of Bulligan 's , and neither is Ed . " " I should n't dream of asking you to . There 'd be no sense to it , anyway , since we have n't the faintest notion of which way you ought to go or how soon you 'd run out of fuel . Steve , can you at least get your luggage compartment open ? " " That we can do . " " Then why do n't we tell people they can have access to their suit/cases if they want ? That may buck them up a little . I would n't mind a clean shirt , myself . " " Sure , let ' em come . What are we going to do about Ace here ? " " Tuck him up and let him enjoy his nap , do n't you think ? It 's not that cold out here now . " In fact , it must have been well past noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Grumman was warming up nicely now that they had the door open . " Is there a rubber sheet or something we could slide under him , just in case ? " " A couple of those plastic bags we use for the garbage would do the trick . " Steve lowered one of the reclining chairs . " Here , he might as well ride in style . He 's a gutsy old bugger , you have to say that for him . Pretty crazy , though , do n't you think ? " " Has to be to fly that wreck on faith and alcohol fumes , " Ed agreed . " Here 's a blanket and pillow . " Together the three men made a comfortable bed on the luxurious recliner and lifted Ace into it . He did n't weigh much . " I wonder what he eats and where he gets it , " said Steve . " I wonder what I 'm going to eat , if it comes to that . Any chance of some lunch , Madoc ? " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . We 'll scrape somethingtogether . Speaking of which , is there anything left from last night that might as well get used up ? " " See for yourself , it 'll be in the food locker here . " There was n't a great deal : mostly sweet cakes and the bottom layer of that huge box of chocolates , plus some cheese and fruit and about half a tin apiece of regular and decaffeinated coffee . Coffee was one thing Madoc had n't been able to find at the hotel . With soup and crackers , these gleanings would make quite a decent meal . Madoc did n't feel particularly hungry himself ; he did n't see why anybody else should , after the way they 'd pigged out at breakfast . Maybe it was the mountain air . Or the fact that Ed and Steve had been first to get fed this morning while he himself had been the last . He bundled the viands into a big white cardboard box that had probably held sandwiches and carried them over to where most of the onlookers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ochs and their chances of being rescued soon . Joe Ragovsky detached himself from the group . " Need any help , Madoc ? "  | " Thank you , Joe . Would you mind carrying this stuff into the kitchen and checking the fire ? It probably needs more wood . " " Sure thing . What 's happening out there ? Is that old guy going to get help for us ? " " I hope so . Unfortunately , though , he 's taken a bit of a turn and will have to rest for a while before he can set off . " It would n't help morale any to explain that Bulligan had in fact got sloshed and passed out . " Then I may as well call a rehearsal , " said Sir Emlyn . " Come along , ladies and gentlemen . " " Sir Emlyn , I do n't have my instrument , " said Helene Dufresne . " It 's on the train . " " Along with our music , " Cedric Rintoul pointed out . " So I guess we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , but we can , " said the concertmaster . " We ' ave on the plane the scores for the new piece . It is possible to get them , yes ? " " Yes , " said Madoc . " You can all get your suitcases , if you like . " " We 'll have to rehearse in the lobby , " said Sir Emlyn . " That 's the only room big enough to hold us all . " The Fraser River Cantata had been composed especially for the upcomingoccasion by a young Canadian with whose work both Sir Emlyn and Monsieur Houdon were favorably impressed . The singers liked it too , because he 'd written them all parts that were showy but not too demanding . At the prospect of something to do , the whole group perked up . Since the chairs were still in the kitchen , it was decided that they might as well eat lunch before moving them out to what had now become the rehearsal room . Sir Emlyn , who had done a really splendid job of cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather downcast at the thought of having it dirtied up again , but bowed to the will of the majority . Opening cans of soup and heating up their contents was no great chore compared to flipping flapjacks . Madoc set out the cheese and fruit with some biscuits to keep the pack occupied while he resumed what was by now generally considered his official role as company chef . He wondered whether he ought to have a bonfire going outside , now that they knew the search for them was on . But there was the smoke from the chimneys where no smoke ought to be , and he was loath top73burn up the hotel 's entire supply of firewood on the off chance that some circling plane would spot the blaze . Besides , the two downed planes were in sight , or rather one downed plane and one downed pilot . The ancient triplane was a distress signal in itself . Madoc hoped Ace Bulligan would come out of his stupor in a more chastened and rational frame of mind , but he was n't about to bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheese and fruit disappeared before Madoc could get any . He did manage to snaffle himself a bowlful of soup and a handful of crackers . His thought had been to sit at the table with the rest , but there was no chair left for him to sit on . He 'd never considered himself a big eater , but he was beginning to feel himself a damnably frustrated one . He took his soup out to the lobby to eat it at the counter for lack of a better place . Even here there was no peace for him . As he was approachinghis destination , giving serious thought to the enjoyment of that first hot , savoury spoonful , Lady Rhys came down the stairs . " Oh , good , you 're taking soup to Lucy . But dear , could n't you have set the bowl on a tray ? " " Mother , I am not taking this soup to Lucy , " he replied with some asperity . " I 'm going to eat it myself . After I 've done that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tray or a broomstick or whatever you fancy . If you want any for yourself , I strongly recommend that you get it now . That 's no orchestra we 're feeding , it 's a flock of vultures . " " And do you feel that their appetites excuse your rudeness in not being willing to sit at the table with them , even though your own father is one of the party ? " " I 'm not sitting with them because they did n't leave me any place to sit . For you , I expect somebody will have the courtesy to get up . Or the timidity . I suppose you know they 're all terrified of you . " " I should hope so , indeed ! Very well , then , get on with your soup . I can serve myself . " " I 'm sure you can , Mother . Bon appetit . " " Madoc , you grow more like your father every day of your life . " With this totally astonishing remark , Lady Rhys took herself kitchenward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all that great , but Madoc enjoyed it . When his bowl was empty , he carried it back to the kitchen and made sure there wasp74washing-up water heating on the stove . Mindful of his mother 's critical eye , he spread a paper napkin on a tray , added a couple of pink petits fours for a touch of color , and loaded it with a fresh bowl of soup , another napkin , a spoon , a cup of pre-milked and sugared tea , and a few crackers on a little plate . Lucy could crumble them into the soup if her throat was still too sore to eat them dry . He carried the trayful upstairs and tapped at Lucy 's door . " Feel like a bit of lunch ? " " Is that you , Madoc ? Come on in . What sort of lunch ? " " Soup and crackers and a cup of tea . I hope you take milk and sugar . " " Yes , thanks . Actually , I feel quite hungry . I must be getting better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can manage another day or two if we have to , but I do n't expect we shall . The news is out that we 're missing , so I expect someone will be along to rescue us before long . Did my mother tell you we already have one visitor ? " " The crazy old man in the toy airplane ? Fat lot of good he 'll do us . Oh well , maybe the next one will be a Boeing . This smells good . " Lucy applied herself to her soup . When Madoc had come in with the tray , she 'd been sitting propped up against a couple of pillows , reading a paperback thriller . At least he assumed it must be a thriller ; the cover showed a voluptuous redhead in a few wisps of black lace , sprawled over the side of a barber 's chair . A straight-backed razor lay in a deepishpool of blood just below her slashed throat . She must have been the manicurist , Madoc thought , or perhaps the girl who did the shampooing . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reasoned that she 'd be far less apt to get her clothes wet if she was n't wearing any to speak of . If that was supposed to be her blood on the floor , however , the artist had made her far too rosy-looking a corpse to convince a policeman . Rather than sit staring at Lucy eating her soup , Madoc picked up the book and started to read : Hunk crumpled the empty Coors can in his hairy , sweaty paw and flung it into the fireplace . There was no fire in the fireplace , merely a messy heap of crumpled Coors cans and dirty shirts he 'd been meaning to take to the laundry for the past month or so . Thep75stench of stale beer and unwashed shirts was perhaps a trifle on the overpowering side , but to Hunk it meant home sweet home . That broad who 'd phoned him last night begging him to protect her from some guy who was trying to make her give him back the deed to his barbershop had sounded like a nubile redhead . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . He sometimes wondered what they saw in a sixty-seven-yearoldcop who 'd turned private eye not for the glamour of it but because there was n't much else for a cop to do after he 'd been kicked off the force for chronic alcoholism and unclean habits . Whatever he had , they sure wanted it . It was tough on his hemorrhoids , but what the hell ? Hunk hurled the now empty beer can after its predecessor and went to answer the door , at which somebody had by now been thumping frantically for the past ten minutes or so . Was it the redhead with the deed to the barbershop ? Was it the landlord optimisticallyhoping to collect the rent ? Was it a hood with a tommy gun and a contract on Hunk Murgatroyd 's life ? Hoping it was the hood with the tommy gun , Madoc laid the book back on the bed and went back to watching Lucy finish her soup.  |p76Lucy  Shadd looked almost as rosy as the corpse in the barber chair . The rest must be doing her good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day off . The silk scarf she 'd wound around her neck prevented Madoc from seeing whether the red line had faded any . However , it could n't be bothering her too much ; he made his Holmesian deduction from the fact that she was eating the crackers dry instead of dunking them in the soup . She cleaned up everything he 'd brought , including the two pink petits fours . " Thanks , Madoc , that tasted really great . I must have been hungrierthan I realized . But please do n't go spreading the word around that I 'm feeling better . This is the first day off I 've had in ages . It 's a tradition in orchestral touring that the head of operations never sleeps . And , believe me , we never do . What 's happening downstairs ? " Madoc filled her in on the morning 's developments , adding that suitcaseswere now accessible and that he 'd bring hers up if she wanted it . " I do n't , actually . If I could get at my clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Once I 'm dressed , my holiday will be over . So that old man heard on the news that our plane had turned up missing ? Was there anything about Wilhelm , did he say ? " If Lucy Shadd was resilient enough to beguile her recovery from a near-strangling by reading about a nubile redhead getting her throat slashed , Madoc decided she probably had the stomach to be told now what she 'd have to learn sooner or later anyway . " Yes , there was . I do n't know how much stock to put in anything Bulligan told us , but from what I could piece together out of his ramblings , Ochs has been found to have died from ricin poisoning . " " Ricin ? What 's that ? I 've never heard of it . " " As it happens , I have . We had a case back in Fredericton last year.  |p77Ricin  is one of the potentially lethal vegetable alkaloids like taxine and digitalin . The only source for it I can think of offhand is the castor bean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only know castor sugar and casters on furniture legs . " " Well , surely you 've heard of castor oil ? " " Ugh , did you have to remind me ? God , that stuff is awful . Does castor oil come from castor beans ? " " Yes , it does . They in turn come from a rather handsome plant that 's often grown as an ornamental in people 's gardens . " " Whatever for ? That sounds like an awfully stupid thing to do , but then , I 've never been much of a gardener . Wilhelm was , though . At least he used to buy little potted plants to take with him when we went on long bus tours . I should think he 'd have known better than to swallowa castor bean . " " Mere swallowing would n't have killed him . The beans would have simply passed through his digestive tract . They must have been ground up and mixed in with his food or something of the sort . I 'm told Ochs was a fairly enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate like a pig , even though he had all kinds of ghastly stomach problems . Did n't anybody tell you that ? " Madoc nodded . " I 've heard . " " From Frieda , I 'll bet . She always hated Wilhelm 's guts . Oh , God ! I did n't mean that the way it came out . I just meant she hated having to cope with his stomach . You can imagine what it 's like to be jammed up in close quarters with somebody who 's always belching or breaking wind . And of course it 's been worse since Sir Emlyn took over as guest conductor . " " Good Lord , why ? Was he allergic to my father ? " " No , but it means we 're doing all those choral pieces . You ca n't fit a chorus onstage without squeezing the musicians closer together than usual . Frieda 's prissy in some ways , and Wilhelm did have a pretty gross sense of humor . " " You and he were good friends , though , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to first chair ? " " After I could n't blow my own horn anymore , sure . Actually I like what I 'm doing now a lot better , but that 's beside the point . Yes , I did put in a good word for him , which was about all I could do . It 's not thep78musicians who carry the clout , as any of them will be only too willing to tell you . Wilhelm would have been the logical choice anyway . He 'd been with the orchestra almost as long as I had , he was a really fine player , and he knew the Wagstaffe sound . " " Your sound ? " " Every major orchestra  --  minor ones too , I suppose  --  has a distinctiveway of playing . Some go for a big , grand noise ; others are crisper , lighter . It 's hard to explain to somebody with a tin ear ; your father could probably tell you better than I. Anyway , if you 've got somebody in the orchestra who 's capable of playing first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring in somebody new who 'll need time to play himself in . Not that it would n't be the fair thing to do anyway , but fairness is n't always a conductor 's primary consideration . " " Surely you ca n't call my father unfair ? " " He would n't have any say in the matter unless he was the permanentmusic director . Guest conductors usually make the best of what they get except for choosing the big star soloists who are n't normally members of any orchestra . We knew Sir Emlyn would be bringing his own singers with him , but who cares about singers ? They 're not interested in us , they 're just along for the laughs , as you may have gathered . Naming no names , you understand . " Lucy picked up the empty tray to set it aside . Madoc leaped up from the windowsill where he 'd been perching and took it from her . " Did Ochs complain to you about not feeling well either yesterday or the day before ? " " Wilhelm was always complaining about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly . But why the day before ? " Lucy was sharp , no doubt about that . " Apparently ricin can take quite a while to act after it 's been in-gested . " " Surely not a whole two days ? " " What about late evening of the previous day ? " Madoc pointed out . " That would be only a twenty-four hour span , perhaps even less . Do n't the orchestra members ever go out for a late supper after a concert ? " " Oh yes , often , particularly the horns and the winds . We  --  they , I suppose I ought to say  --  tend to eat lightly beforehand . And playing a full symphony concert is desperately hard work , in case you did n't know , so one 's often starving by the time it 's over . Wilhelm was alwaysp79hungry anyway . He claimed he ate to quiet his ulcers down which no doubt would have happened if he 'd chosen his food sensibly , but he never did . " " What sort of food was Ochs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curries , fried fish , fried potatoes , fried steak , fried chicken , fried anything . Mexican food when he could get it , Chinese food , Italian food  --  he loved that . Giant hamburgers with lots of raw onion . You know , macho he-man stuff , though he 'd even eat quiche in a pinch . And douse it with ketchup , no doubt . He was great for Worcestershiresauce , piccalilli , mustard , all that stuff . " " Did he drink much ? " " Liquor , you mean ? A fair amount of beer and wine if it was on the table , but seldom anything stronger . Wilhelm was basically an eater , not a drinker . If he was in fact poisoned on purpose and not by accident , I expect you 're right about its having been put in his food . It would n't be hard to fool him . He 'd order shrimp cocktail , for instance , and doctor the sauce up with so much tabasco and horseradish that he could n't possibly have tasted anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilhelm would eat horseradish by the spoonful . " " So what you 're saying , Lucy , is that he must have pretty well paralyzedhis taste buds long ago . " " I should think so , yes . But why would anybody want to murder poor old Bill ? " " Why should anybody want to murder you , for that matter ? I 'm sorry to bring it up again , Lucy , but when an attempt is made on somebody 's life , it 's usually for a reason , even if the reason is a totally insane one . Can you think why anybody connected with the orchestra might have wanted to kill either of you ? " The middle-aged woman in the shabby twin bed stared up at Madoc for a long moment , then shook her well-groomed gray head . " God , Madoc , what a question ! I suppose I get under a few people 's skins now and then . I 'm the one who has to keep nagging them after all , about things like not stuffing their personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make connections . And paying their hotel charges before they leave . I 'm sure everybody thinks I 'm a pain in the neck , but I find it hard to believe I 've managed to make anyone mad enough to kill me. "  |p80She  shifted her position , as though the sagging mattress had grown too uncomfortable to tolerate any longer . " As for Wilhelm , the only reason I can think of is that one of the other horn players might want his chair . But there 's no guarantee they 'd get it even if they did bump him off . Surely any player must realize that . I 'll grant you it would have been physically possible for one of the musicians who went on the train to have slipped him the poison either at supper the night before or any time yesterday . Maybe even in a candy bar or something . Would that work ? " " I suppose so , " Madoc replied , " if you were clever enough to pull it off . Invite him to a movie , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark . " " Or take him for a walk and buy him a hot dog , and mix the poison in with the piccalilli and chopped onion . Wilhelm always ordered raw onion when he could get it . He used to say that was the only way he could bear hanging out with Cedric Rintoul . Cedric eats onions by the bucketful . Ugh , this is scary to think about ! You do n't suppose there 's any chance somebody dumped ricin into that soup I just ate ? " " If they did , we 'll go together , " Madoc reassured her . " I ate soup from that same kettle and so did everybody else in the company . I should n't worry about the soup , Lucy . It came out of tins which I opened myself , and my father was right there helping to stir it . " " Sir Emlyn was working in the kitchen ? " Lucy was gaping at Madoc as if he 'd all of a sudden sprouted antlers . " Madoc , you ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast dishes . " " Do n't bother talking nonsense to me , Madoc . I have no sense of humor to speak of , and I never appreciate stupid jokes . Sir Emlyn did no such thing . " " Oh yes he did , and quite capably , too . Why should n't he ? " " Because it 's highly inappropriate . Conductors just do n't act like that . I 'd better get up . " " Whatever for ? We 're managing perfectly well without you . " That was unkind , but she had no business calling Sir Emlyn inappropriate . " Lucy , you ca n't honestly believe my father would behave in an unseemly manner under any circumstances . We 're in a highly unusual situation . For however long we 're stuck here , everybody 's going to have to pitch in and help out . My father is setting an example which Ip81sincerely hope the rest of the crowd are going to emulate , because I 'm not finding it all that appropriate for me to get stuck with the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts a different face on the matter . " Lucy pulled back the foot she 'd stuck outside the blankets and resettled herself on the pillows . " I just hope they understand why he 's doing it . " " If they do n't , I 'm sure my mother will be glad to explain . Now let 's get back to the important stuff . Tell me about Cedric Rintoul . " " What do you mean , tell you about him ? What do you want me to say ? " " I sha n't know that till I 've heard it , shall I ? My work consists largely of gathering information that 's not going to do me any good , but I have to keep on asking silly questions because sooner or later somebodywill give me the right answer . Since we have nothing else to go on , Lucy , we may as well act for the time being on the premise that the person who fed ricin to Wilhelm Ochs is quite likely the same one who tried to strangle you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the facts , Lucy . It 's generally known among the orchestra members , is it not , that you and Wilhelm Ochs were old friends as well as close colleagues ? " " Oh yes . " " It 's also common knowledge that you have a special advantage in being both an ex-player and the present director of operations . If anybody is in a position to have inside information or opinions about why or by whom Ochs was poisoned , you 're a likelier person than anyone else . Is n't that what they 'd think ? " " But I do n't . " " But you might , Lucy . You see , the poisoner could n't very well come up to you and ask . " " All right , Madoc , you 've made your point . " " So that rather whittles things down , would n't you say ? It has to be one of the people here with us now who put that violin string around your neck . " " Yes , of course . I 'm not altogether stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , they all had plenty of opportunity to kill him . And you think it was Cedric who did it . " " No , Lucy , I do not . At this stage , I have to suspect everybody alike ,  |p82exce|pt  myself because I have an airtight alibi . Ricin is a slow-acting poison , so Ochs must have got it quite some time before it began to work , as we 've already discussed . I was working at my desk in the Fredericton RCMP headquarters until late afternoon day before yesterday . My wife drove me to the airport . My plane was late arriving in Wagstaffe , and I did n't get to the concert until the orchestra was onstagetuning up . By that time , Ochs was already heading for the last roundup . " " But the rest of us are all suspects . Even me , I suppose . What about your parents ? " " I ca n't rule them out , can I ? I will say they 're not likely suspects because they 're only temporarily connected with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know Ochs well enough to hate him , and in any case , would n't have had to kill him to get rid of him . I expect we can eliminate both the pilots because they had no connection with the orchestra and never even got to meet Ochs . Unless it turns out one of them is his long-lost cousin who 'll step into the family fortune now that Ochs is no longer in the way . You see , we must n't overlook any pos-sibilities . " " No , I suppose not . Okay , Madoc , I 'll play . " " Good . So tell me about Rintoul . Have you known him long ? Was there any friction between him and Ochs ? Does he get on well with the rest of the orchestra ? What about his personal life ? As to why I happened to mention Rintoul first , do n't go getting any ideas . It 's just that he rather tends to thrust himself forward . " " That 's a tactful way of putting it , I must say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful pest sometimes . So can his buddy , Jason . " " We 'll get to Jason later . " Madoc pulled out his notebook and waited . Lucy rubbed her chin fretfully . " I 'm on , eh ? Oh gosh , let 's see . Well , Cedric joined the Wagstaffe about ten years ago , I believe it was . He came from one of the provincial symphonies , I ca n't remember which but it 'll be in the personnel files . He 'd known Wilhelm long before that , so they got to be great buddies . Wilhelm thought Cedric was a riot and egged him on , which of course Cedric loved . He 's not a particularly happy man underneath , if you want my personal opinion . It 's the old Pagliacci act . You know , laughing on the outside , crying on the inside . "  | " Why should Rintoul be unhappy ? Does he feel threatened in his job ? " " No reason why he should . Cedric 's about as good as they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washout otherwise . Especially with women . " " Any particular woman ? " " No , just women in general . He always comes on strong to any new woman in the ensemble . Corliss Blair , for instance ; he made a big play for her , but she was n't playing . Cedric 's problem is , he does n't know how to act . He 's like a kid in school , thinking he can get a girl 's attentionby teasing her with a dead mouse or something . " " Has he ever waved a dead mouse your way ? " " Getting personal , are n't you ? No , you see it was different with me . I was just one of the boys in the brass section . We 'd go out and grab a bite together , that sort of thing , but that was as far as it ever went . " " You have n't been doing that nowadays ? " " Once in a while . Now that I 'm director of operations , I never have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang any longer . " Lucy put her hand up to her neck . " Is your throat bothering you ? " Madoc was constrained to ask . " Would you rather not go on with this just now ? " " No , I 'm all right . I could use another cup of tea , when you get around to it . I did want to say about Cedric that he 's really not a bad guy , even though he does drive people nuts sometimes . He 's generous , for one thing . Too generous for his own good , sometimes . " " What do you mean by that ? " " Well , he lends money and does n't get paid back . " " To whom does he lend it ? People in the orchestra ? " " Well sure . Those are the only people he knows . The only ones he associates with , anyway . " " Can you think of anybody who 's heavily in debt to him at the moment ? " " Look , I think you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it has to do with this business of my getting strangled . " " Nor do I , " Madoc admitted cheerfully . " By the way , you 're not  --  " " I 'm not in hock to Cedric , no , nor to anybody else . And I don'tlend , either . My money belongs to me , and I hang on to it . Next ques-tion ? "  |p84Lucy  had said all she was going to say about Cedric Rintoul , that was clear . Madoc was too experienced an interrogator to force the issue . " Then what about Rintoul 's pal , Jasper ? " Lucy shrugged . " You need n't try to borrow any money from him , either . Jason 's always broke . He has five kids to support , two of them in college , not to mention a wife and a mortgage . I believe the wife 's gone back to work , though , to help foot the college bills . She was a trained nurse before they started having kids . " " So he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't let him back you into a corner , or he 'll start showingyou photographs . Jason hates having to leave home . I think that 's why he clowns around with Cedric so much when we 're on tour , to keep himself from feeling homesick . He does n't do it when we 're back in Wagstaffe . " " That 's where he lives ? " " Just outside the city , in an area that used to be country and is getting to be another bedroom community . He 's got quite a decent place , and he 's crazy about it . We never see him in Wagstaffe except at rehearsals and concerts . The rest of the time he 's lugging the kids to hockey games or puttering around his garden . He has a little greenhouse , too . He comes to rehearsal with big bags full of stuff : cucumbers , cabbages , out-of-season tomatoes , you name it , and passes them out to anybody who wants them . Flowers sometimes , too , but the veggies are his big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery bill . " " With five kids , I expect they do , " said Madoc . He was thinking about castor oil plants . Jasper would n't have room for one in his greenhouse , but he might grow some outdoors , now that his children werep85evidently old enough to leave the seeds alone . " You say he 's always hard up . Does he borrow from Rintoul ? " Lucy scowled . " I would n't know about that . Look , Madoc , I told you I do n't like these questions about money . As far as I know , Jason does n't borrow from anybody , unless you count the bank . His wife works , as I said . The kids get part-time jobs , and in a pinch they could all live on peas and carrots . He 's getting by . And in case you were about to ask whether he fools around on tour , the answer is no . He 's so monogamous it 's pitiful . " " Does he gamble ? " " What do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not for big stakes . Offhand , I ca n't think of anybody on your list who does . They ca n't afford to . Musicians in the Wagstaffe are decently paid , but they do n't make wads of money like rock stars . On tour , the management pays for transportation , food , and lodging , but not for incidentals . It gets expensive , all those little things like paying for your laundry and having to tip somebody everytime you turn around . The only thing Jason squanders money on are silly jokes like whoopee cushionsand presents he can take home to the kids . He 's a really simplemindedguy . " " How long has he been with the orchestra ? " " Forever , I think . He was here before I was , anyway . I 'm not sure but what this is the only orchestra he 's ever played with . The only major one , certainly . Jason did n't get to be principal trumpet until about five years ago , though . He rose from the ranks , like Wilhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about lining up another horn player . " " There 'll be time enough for that when you get to where you can hire one , " said Madoc . " Anyway , you ca n't talk to my father now . He 's called a rehearsal . " " Then why are n't they rehearsing ? I do n't hear anything . " " Come to think of it , neither do I. Maybe he has n't finished washing the dishes yet . I hope he 's also seeing about that pit for the latrine . It slipped my mind entirely . " " Latrine pit ? Remind me to compliment Lady Rhys on what a classy conversationalist she 's got for a son . And do n't tell me Sir Emlyn 's doing the digging himself , I already told you I do n't like sick jokes . " " No , my father 's afraid of straining his shoulder before the festival . Ip86expect my mother 's doing it for him . So that 's all you have to tell me about Jason Jasper ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know his kids ' names , ages , and the brand of toothpaste they prefer . " " Later perhaps . Let 's see how well we can do on Frieda Loye . Did you offer to share with her last night because you 're friends or because you consider it part of your job to cope with her nightmares ? " " Wrong both times . I like Frieda well enough but would n't call her a close friend . We have , however , been roommates lots of times , simply because for quite a while we were the only two women in the orchestra . She does n't snore , she does n't invite guys into the room , she 's neat in her habits , and she does n't always have nightmares . Why should n't I room with her ? Next question ? " " Is she married ? " " No , the Mrs. is sort of a courtesy title . She had what they call nowadays a significant other , but he died . " " How long ago was this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's been anybody since , certainly nobodyfrom the orchestra . She has a little apartment in Wagstaffe . It 's nice . " She meant it was n't . Madoc wondered what sort of living quarters Lucy herself had , and what kind of reaction he 'd get from Frieda if he asked . " What does she do with her spare time ? " " She needlepoints . She 's got needlepoint pillows on her couch , needlepointseats on her chairs , needlepoint pictures on her walls , a brick covered with needlepoint that she uses for a doorstop . I could n't stand doing that artsy-craftsy stuff myself , but Frieda says it calms her nerves . " " Frieda 's nerves seem to be giving her a great deal of trouble these days , " Madoc ventured . " Was she always like this ? " " Like what ? " " About two jitters from a nervous collapse . " " Well , my God , what do you expect ? How 'd you like to wake up and find your roommate getting strangled ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think that 's her problem . She was the same way last night at the concert . And I ca n't say your friend Rintoul was helping her out of it . What does he have against her ? "  | " What do you mean , against her ? Nothing that I know of . I told you Cedric makes a pest of himself because he wants to be noticed . He was trying to get a rise out of her , that 's all . Frieda 's such a damned stoic that she just toughs it out instead of turning around and telling him to stuff himself , so he tries all the harder . If you 're trying to hold me responsible for his pulling that trick with the violin string during the performance , I 'm here to tell you I did n't know anything about it . If I had , I 'd have taken the fool thing away from him during intermission , not that it would have been my job to do so . As it happened , I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about seventy million other things on my mind . And then there was Wilhelm . Damn it , I liked Wilhelm ! Why do n't you get off my back for a while , eh ? My throat hurts . " " I 'll get you that cup of tea . Oh , just one more thing . You said back in Wagstaffe that Ochs had a brother . Was that his only family ? He never married ? " Lucy jerked her body straight up to a sitting position , her hand still pressing the scarf to her throat . " Madoc , why did n't I think of that before ? Sure , Wilhelm was married for a while , to a young singer he met somewhere in the provinces . That was ages ago , too . She 's not so young any more . Her real name was Norma Belschi but of course she changed it . " Ah so . Am I correct in inferring from your information that MadameBellini has n't always been Madame Bellini ? " " You are . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , if Jacques-Marie ever found out about her and Wilhelm . Jacques looks like a nice , quiet , gentlemanly guy , but do n't let that fool you . He 's jealous as hell and has the temper of a fiend once he gets wound up . Madoc , could I please have my tea now ? " " Sorry . I 'll get it right away . " For the past couple of minutes , Madoc had been hearing tentative tweets and hoots , from which he 'd deduced that the rehearsers were finally getting down to business . As he went downstairs into the lobby , he saw them grouped around his father in the chairs they 'd dragged back from the kitchen . Lady Rhys and Helene Dufresne were there , too , either to lend moral support or for want of other entertainment . Helene was sitting with her knees apart and her hands making tune-upp88motions that suggested she was all set to rehearse even without her instrument . Cedric Rintoul was sitting on the opposite side of the circle from Frieda Loye , Madoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . However , he 'd reckoned without the tricky trombonist 's infinite resources . As Frieda raised her flute to her lips and glanced down at the score she was having to hold in her lap for want of a music stand , something small and furry whizzed across the floor , straight at her feet . Madoc recognized the thing at once ; it was the wind-up mouse he 'd seen in Rintoul 's room . Frieda recognized it , too . After one shrill yip , she laid down her flute , bounded across the room , and started belaboringRintoul with her fists , screaming like a banshee all the while . " Damn you to hell , leave me alone ! Leave me alone ! " Her screams degenerated into inchoate shrieks ; she went totally out of control . Sir Emlyn stuck his baton in his pocket , stepped over to Frieda , and gave her a pretty hard slap in the face . For the second time in his conducting career , Sir Emlyn raised his voice . " This is unprofessional behavior , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better go to your room . Lady Rhys will go with you . Rintoul , I have no authority to fire you but you are out of this orchestra for as long as I am conducting it . " " What ? " The huge trombonist stared up at the furious little Welshmanas if he could not believe what he was hearing . " But I was only trying to  --  " " You were making an ass of yourself and you were deliberately disruptingmy rehearsal . You have behaved abominably during every performanceI have conducted thus far on this tour . I will not have you playing under me again . Please go away . Now . " As if he were sleepwalking , Rintoul took his trombone and his mouse , and lumbered off into the kitchen . Sir Emlyn turned back to the circle . " Ladies and gentlemen , I apologize for having lost my temper . I do not feel myself sufficiently collected to go on with this rehearsal . I ask your pardon for having taken up your time to no avail . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . I am going out for a walk . " He laid his baton on top of the score they 'd never got to work on , made his usual diffident half bow , and walked out the front door . Those left behind turned to Madoc.  | " I have to make a cup of tea for Lucy Shadd , " he told them . " Why do n't you all go out for a walk ? " They started shuffling their chairs , putting their instruments in their cases , murmuring and shrugging to one another . Madoc walked into the kitchen . Rintoul was there with his trombone , almost in tears . " I did n't know he could be like that . I was only trying to liven things up a little . " " You appear to have succeeded beyond your expectations . " Madoc pulled the simmering tea kettle to the front of the stove to make it boil . " What is it you have against Frieda Loye , Rintoul ? " " I do n't have anything against her ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 're not deliberately trying to drive her round the bend ? " " Of course not ! What do you take me for ? " " Either a fool or a liar or both . Is it possible you honestly had no idea that your so-called jokes are raising hell with Frieda 's nervous system ? " " Look , I have n't the foggiest notion what you 're talking about . " The kettle was bubbling now . Madoc found a clean teapot , threw in what he thought was probably an adequate amount of tea , and set it to steep on a tray . Remembering that his mother and Frieda would probably be upstairs with the invalid by now , he added three mugs , three spoons , and little bowls of sugar and powdered milk . He often carried tea up to Janet at home ; he wished to God he were doing so this time . She 'd also have heard the radio reports about the missing plane by now ; she must be frantic . Why the bloody hell did n't somebody come searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept off the vodka yet , and try to bribe or threaten him into taking that old crate to wherever it was possible to get out word that they had n't crashed . This time , Madoc would pour the liquor into the gas tank himself if necessary . Which would n't be any guarantee against the old bugger 's trying to siphon it out . He knocked at the door of the bedroom he 'd so recently left . Lady Rhys met him at the door and took the tray . " Thank you , dear . I 've given Frieda another tablet . Where 's your father ? " " Gone for a walk . You know , this is the first time in my life I 've seen Tad lose his temper . " " It does n't happen often . What 's happened to Cedric ? "  | " I left him in the kitchen , looking stricken . " " As well he might . Beastly fellow ! We 'd been hoping he 'd straighten out as the tour went on , but he 's gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea your father 's a pushover . People do n't make that mistake , as a rule . It 's odd , you know ; one expects a certain amount of horseplay and tolerates it within reason , but this out-and-out sadism is something quite new in our experience . Has he always been such a monster , Lucy ? " " I 've already talked to your son about Cedric , Lady Rhys . If you do n't mind , my throat 's really bothering me . " " Of course , Lucy . We 'll discuss it later , Madoc . " Thus dismissed , Madoc wandered back downstairs . Rather , he tried to wander . Left with nothing to do , the musicians and singers must have come to a group decision that they were n't going to be rescued today and might as well get their luggage out of the plane before it got too dark . Since they were limited to one suitcase and one carry-on bag apiece , the suitcases tended to be on the large side . Getting down that narrow wooden staircase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to go down the up escalator at Toronto airport during rush hour , Madoc found . Being slim and agile , he made it unscathed , but it took time . Joe Ragovsky was waiting for him in the lobby . " I dug us a hole out back . " " Oh good , " Madoc replied . " Do people know what to do about it ? " " Yeah , I spread the word . " " Thank you , Joe . I 'd meant to tend to it earlier , but one way and another , this has been a busy day . I 'd like to chat with you a bit when you have a minute . " " No time like the present , " the viola player replied . " Let 's go to the kitchen and make ourselves a cuppa . " Madoc was about to object in case Rintoul was still there , then he shrugged . They could always take their mugs outside if the atmosphere got too sticky . However , the deposed trombonist was not to be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surely vain hope of getting him to change his mind . More likely , he was upstairs rewindinghis mechanical mouse and trying to elicit sympathy from his colleagues . While Joe got down the mugs , Madoc pumped a kettleful of fresh water , took off a stove lid , and set the kettle directly over the hole to getp91the full benefit from the handsome bed of shimmering red coals that had collected over the day . " This should n't take long to boil , " he remarked . " I wish we had a piece of my wife 's pie to go with the tea . " " Your wife does her own baking ? " Joe sounded surprised . " I figured you 'd have a bunch of maids in the house . " " On a policeman 's salary ? Figure again , Joe . We have a cleaner in once a week and a neighbor 's kid to water the plants and feed the cat when we go away , which we do n't do all that often , except for overnight visits to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About the same . My wife 's a schoolteacher , so it 's next to impossible for us to go anywhere together except during the school vacations . With three kids , it 's too damned expensive anyway . My mother-in-law lives with us , which takes some of the load off . She 's a good egg . But a terrible cook . I get most of the meals when I 'm around . I like to cook . " " Damn your eyes , why did n't you tell me sooner ? " " What ? And miss being able to say I 've had my pancakes flipped by the guy who captured Mad Carew ? " Madoc scowled . " Oh , you know about that ? " " Sure , I caught on right away to who you were , but I have n't told anybody . I thought you might be traveling incognito . " " Hold the thought , Joe . I 'm sick of hearing about Carew , and my mother thinks the whole business was disgustingly uncouth . Tell me something . " Madoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from Rintoul 's trombone and the longer one he 'd picked up from Lucy Shadd 's bedroom floor . " Could these possibly be from the same string ? " Joe took the two bits of wire and held them up to the fast-fading light . " Could be . This is a D-string with one end cut off , and this little bit here looks like the end . " " It 's wrapped in a different color thread from the other end , " Madoc objected . " I know , that 's how they come . " " The string would n't have been yours , by any chance ? " " Nope , this one 's from a violin . I play viola . Our D-strings are thicker and longer . You would n't notice the difference , but it 's perfectly obvious to me. "  | " How do you suppose the cut was made ? Could you do it with a small pocket knife ? " " Hell , no . This string was made to withstand up to ninety pounds pressure ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sensible thing would be to use a wire cutter . " " And where would you get one of those in a hurry ? " " From Dave Gabriel , I 'd say offhand . Oboe and bassoon players spend about half their time playing their instruments and the other half making new reeds for them . That 's what those mouthpieces are , you know , just hollow reeds like you 'd pick out of a swamp . Only this is a special kind of reed that only grows in France or somewhere . The guys have kits with knives and stuff they use to cut and shape the reeds , and string and wire to bind them with . Bassoon reeds have to be wired , then wrapped with string over the wire . Dave coaches a woodwind ensemble , so he carries a great big kit with every kind of tool known to man , pretty much . He 's sure to have wire cutters . " " Would the cutters be easy to steal ? " " I guess so , if you were mean enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the canvas covers of their instrument cases . You could sneak a cutter out and stick it back again easily enough without getting caught , but why go to the bother ? Could n't you just ask to borrow it for a second ? " " Certainly you could , " said Madoc , " provided you were n't planning to use the string to strangle somebody . "  | " God , what minds you cops must have ! " Joe Ragovsky actually backed away from the strings Madoc was holding out to him . " What the hell possessed you to say that ? " " I found this longer piece on the floor beside Lucy Shadd 's bed after that screaming incident early this morning . She claimed she 'd been attacked by a masked intruder , and had a red line around her throat that suggested an attempt at strangulation . " " My God ! I did n't know that . " " Not many of this crowd do , and I 'd as soon you did n't spread the word around . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Cedric Rintoul 's trombone slide . He 'd been using it to tickle the back of Frieda Loye 's neck during the concert last night . Perhaps you noticed ? " " No , I did n't notice . If I had , I 'd have busted the son of a bitch 's jaw for him . Cedric 's been tormenting Frieda lately every chance he gets , and it makes me sick . What the hell , I do n't mind a little clowning around . I do it myself sometimes . But picking on a middle-aged woman who 's halfway round the bend to start with  --  I 'm damned glad your father gave him the shove , if you want the truth . Cedric ought to have had his ears pinned back long before this . " Joe simmered down from irate to bothered . " Only thing that worries me is what 's going to happen with our brass section at the festival . It 'll be tough having to play with two new guys . " " I 'm sure my father will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got out of worse messes than this . But why do you say Frieda Loye 's a mental case ? On account of those nightmares she 's been having the last few weeks ? " " No , not that . It 's more that she 's been so  --  I do n't quite know how to put it . Funny . Jumpy , snappish , tight as a G-string . I get the impres/sion she 's scared all the time and trying not to let on . I did n't mean to imply that Frieda 's really gone nuts . She 's just  --  different , I guess . Maybe it 's her time of life . My mother-in-law went through a spell a while back . She 'd wake up in the middle of the night worried sick about some damned little thing without knowing why . She was turning herself into a nervous wreck for no good reason . The doctor gave her some pills and she straightened out okay . Probably Frieda ought to be taking something . " " Are you sure she 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean drugs ? No , you get that stuff in the pop bands sometimes , but symphony players do n't go for it as a rule . Specially not , Frieda , she 's big on vitamins and long walks to keep her wind in shape . But that 's terrible , what you said about Lucy . I do n't know why the heck anybody 'd try to strangle her . Say , you do n't suppose Cedric was trying to get another rise out of Frieda and picked the wrong bed , by any chance ? It would be a hell of a stupid thing to do , of course . " " Criminal would be a more apt word than stupid . Do you honestly think Rintoul would go that far ? " " Gosh , Madoc , I 'd hate to say . Cedric 's pulled some pretty crazy stunts , but faking a murder , I do n't know . Did Lucy really get hurt ? Is that why she 's stayed upstairs all day ? " " She says her throat 's still bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choking or from all the yelling she did when she was attacked . Anyway , she 's decided it made a reasonable excuse for her to take a day 's rest for a change , which she apparently deserves . One gathers she 's kept hopping pretty much of the time when the orchestra 's on tour . " " Oh yeah , we have a tradition in this business that the head of operationsnever gets a chance to sleep . It 's not a job for weaklings , that 's for sure , but Lucy took to it like a duck to water . At least it keeps her with the orchestra . I suppose you know Lucy used to be first chair horn ? " " So I 've been told . " Madoc could n't recall how many times by now . " Were you with the orchestra then , Joe ? " " Not really . She switched just a couple of weeks after I got taken on . They claim Lucy used to be first-rate , but you sure could n't have proven it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they could have let her stay on in the brasses and she must have known . Being shifted out must have been an awful blow to her but she took it like ap95soldier , I have to say . I 'll bet she 's toughing out the strangling , too , eh . Christ , women are rugged . I do n't know many men , myself included , who 'd have the nerve to stay up there by themselves all day after having a thing like that happen to them . " " My mother 's been with Lucy a good part of the time . " Joe grinned . " No wonder she feels safe , then . It 'd take a pretty damned determined strangler to try again with Lady Rhys around . No offense to your mother , Madoc . We all think she 's a great lady . " " Mother 's not a bad sort , once you get to know her . " Afraid Joe might think he sounded overenthusiastic about his own parent , Madoc reverted quickly to the main topic at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the alleged strangler 's being Cedric Rintoul trying to get another rise out of Frieda Loye . In that case , Lucy would certainly have recognized him , but would n't want to say so for fear of getting him in serious trouble . She and Rintoul have always got on pretty well , have n't they ? " " Far as I know . He 's the one she hangs out with when she gets the chance , he and Jason Jasper and poor old Wilhelm Ochs . She 's going to miss Wilhelm , they played together for so long . That 's how it is in an orchestra , you know , we tend to club in with our own section . You 're right : if Lucy knows it was Cedric , she wo n't rat on him , you can bet your bottom dollar on that . She 'll wait till she gets the bugger alone and tear him to pieces with her own hands . " " If he 's still around , " said Madoc . " You do n't think Rintoul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out today ? " " Nah , the guys will back him up with the director . Some of them , anyway . Cedric will promise to behave and sober down for a while , then gradually start working his way back into the old routine . We all know it wo n't take long . Cedric 's beginning to flat his high notes a little . You would n't notice it yet , I do n't suppose , but I 'll bet your father has . Our director 's known for a while . He 's a good egg , he 'll go easy till he has to make a move . " " I see . Rintoul will go back and claim my father was one of those Brit bullies who ca n't adjust to our informal Canadian ways . " " Yeah , that 's right , a real Captain Bligh . " Joe was having a lovely time now . " But you do n't act like a Brit . " " Not I. I was born on this side and never wanted to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fredericton. "  | " That 's a nice city . I bet you wish you were back there right now . " " You can say that again , Joe . Were you planning to cook supper tonight ? " " If it 's a case of cook or get pinched , sure . What are we having ? " " Your guess is as good as mine . What is there to have ? " " I 'll scout around the kitchen and see what I can scare up . Say , Madoc , do you think maybe we ought to start going easy on the grub incase we get stuck here for a while ? " " I do n't know what to think . We ca n't be too far off the beaten track if this place is able to function as a tourist trap , and Ace Bulligan knew about us from this morning 's early news broadcast . It does n't seem possible he 's the only one to come searching . I think I 'll go see if I ca n't persuade the old buzzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madoc left Joe to research the food situation and walked out toward the plane . He 'd have to take up the matter of the violin string with Houdon , when he could get him into a corner . There was also La Bellini to tackle . What a turn-up that she 'd once been married to the lubberly Ochs . Could either of his parents have known ? If so , why could n't they have told him ? Was it possible his father and Madame Bellini  --  no , it was not possible . Somewhere around the closed-up ghost town MacVittie and Naxton had found a couple of not very safe-looking wooden ladders . They 'd propped them up against the side of the Grumman and got part of the cowling off . Now they were standing side by side , brooding with bewildermentover the innards thus exposed . " Any luck ? " Madoc called up to them . Ed Naxton scrambled down and beckoned him over . " Be my guest . Steve can show you better than I. " Since the ladder had n't crashed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't break under him , either . He went up , testing each rung before he put his weight on it , and peered into the technologicaltangle with no hope of comprehension . Steve was n't much help . " See , it 's pretty clear what happened . This clyde here must have joggled loose when we took that big drop and started to bounce . The clyde hit that thing there and tore out this other thing , which in turn dislodged the thing underneath it and knocked hell out of the whole damned business . See what I 'm saying ? "  | " Frankly , no , " Madoc admitted . " I do see that things appear to be in a good bit of mess there . Is there anything you can do about it ? " " Without tools , spare parts , or any idea which end is up , not a hell of a lot . We figured we 'd try faith healing , but we 're not sure how well it works on airplane engines . " " Well , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping beauty ? " " A picture no artist could paint . Have a look . " Willingly , Madoc climbed back down the shaky wooden ladder and back up the short metal one into the body of the plane . Ace Bulligan was still stretched out on the plushy club chair , making horrible noises through his sunburnt nose . Sparse , long strands of gray-white hair framed a face that wore an expression of bliss beyond measure . He 'd feel a damned sight less euphoric , the old pirate , when he woke up and tried to move his head . Though Madoc was not a vindictive man by nature , he took some satisfaction in the prospect . Maybe the ancient aeronaut 's senses had been sharpened by his life in the backlands . Anyway , he must have realized that somebody was standing over him , for he opened one eye in a tentative and experimentalmanner . " Who the hell are you ? " " Detective Inspector Rhys of the RCMP . We 've met before , remem-ber ? " " No . Pretty damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in jail this time around . You 're in a private airplane that came down last night in Lodestone Flat with members of the Wagstaffe Symphony Orchestra aboard . " " You do n't say ! What 'd you pinch them for ? " " Disturbing the peace . Mr. Bulligan , do you mean to say you do n't remember flying in here this morning ? You told us you 'd heard a radio broadcast about a missing plane , and had come to find it . " " Wait a minute . Hold your horses . It 's beginnin ' to come back to me . You 're the sneaky bugger that pizened the other bugger . " " No , no . You 've got it all wrong . I 'm the nice fellow who gave you the drink . " " Drink ? " Bulligan sat up and flung aside the blanket . " Did I leave any in the bottle ? " " No , you drank it all . " It was a lie in a good cause , Madoc easilyp98managed to convince himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more . It would depend on how willing you are to help us out of here . " " Huh . I knowed you was a sneaky bugger . Cripes , my mouth 's full o ' fuzz . What 'd I do , swaller the blanket ? " " Would you like a mug of tea ? Or some black coffee ? " " Hell , no , not if I can get anything better . What about that hooch you was goin ' to get hold of ? " " I 'd have to call somebody up and tell them to bring it , " Madoc replied guilefully . " Who 's got the nearest telephone or radio hookup around these parts ? " " Right over there at the hotel . " " Then you do remember where you are . You might also remember that I told you this morning they had n't left any spare batteries . " " Goddamnedest , meanest set o ' stingy buggers I ever run into . Got sore when I borried a couple first winter they 'd been up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that bugger you 're goin ' to call up will bring the whiskey ? " " Cross my heart and hope to die , Mr. Bulligan . You ought to know a Mountie 's as good as his word . It says so right in Renfrew of the Mounted . " " I du n no , you still look like a sneaky little bugger to me . Last time I saw any Mounties , it was down in Calgary . They was all wearin ' them Stetson hats an ' red coats an ' ridin ' horses . " " Yes , I know . We do that sometimes . But you see , the pilot would n't let me bring my horse on the plane . As a flyer yourself , you must surely see that it would n't have done . And if I did n't have the horse , I would n't be needing my red coat and Stetson hat , so I did n't bring them , either . It 's just the same as your not needing to wear your goggles and helmet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell I do n't . I 'd o ' wore ' em to sleep in , only some bugger took ' em an ' hid ' em on me . " " They 're right here on the floor beside your chair , Mr. Bulligan . Why do n't you come over to the hotel and get some coffee into you , then we 'll decide what to do about making that telephone call . " " I ai n't budgin ' from this seat till I get the reward . " " What reward is that ? " " The reward for findin ' the murderer . "  | " What makes you think there 's one being offered ? Did they say so on the radio ? " " No , but they got to , ai n't they ? " " Like hell they do . " Madoc decided he 'd better talk a language Bulligancould understand . " Those stingy buggers down there are n't going to give you a plugged nickel . They 're a bunch of rotten skinflints . The only reward you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we ca n't give you that till we get hold of the chap who 's going to bring it in . Have you got that straight ? Look , if you do n't feel up to walking as far as the hotel , why do n't I go get some coffee and bring it out to you ? In the meantime , you 'd better be thinking over what I 've said . " If Bulligan was still capable of thought . As Madoc left the plane , he began to see what would have to be done . It was going to be dark in another hour or so . There 'd been no sign of a rescue plane yet and there might not be one tomorrow . The search must be taking place in the area over which they were supposed to have been flying , and that could be a very long way from where they actually were . Janet could n't know there was quite possibly a murderer among them ; even so , she must be frantic . The festival staff must be frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of panic , though he had n't yet shown much sign of it . Here he came now , back from his walk and looking much like his usual self . Madoc walked out to meet him . " Hello , Tad . What 's out there ? " " A great deal of nothing I care to see again , son . There is a road , but it does n't look as if it went anywhere . Are they making any progress on the plane ? " " They seem to have discovered the problem , but they say there 's nothing much they can do about it without tools and parts . How desperateis the situation with the festival ? " " If we 're not there by tomorrow night , I shall have no chance to rehearse and get hold of replacements for my brass section . If we do n't make it by Wednesday for the opening , we shall have forfeited our contract and quite possibly ruined the festival , or at the very least caused its producers a good deal of bother having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . I suppose there 's some kind of insurance ; nevertheless , it would cost both the orchestra and the sponsors a great deal of money . " Sir Emlyn was letting the bitterness show , as who could blame him ?  | " I 've never missed an engagement before , Madoc , even during the Blitz of London . The prospect of having to do so now is bitter to me , I have to confess , though I ought to be ashamed of so paltry a feeling in view of what so many other people , including our dear Janet , must be going through ; not knowing whether we 're alive or dead . Is there no way out of this , Madoc ? " " I hope so , Tad . I 'm working on a plan right now . " " Can I help in any way ? " " Yes . Get hold of Mother and keep her occupied for the next fifteen minutes or so . Come on in with me , I was about to get Ace Bulligan a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? " " I think he can be made to see reason . It 's just a matter of getting him back into flying condition . " " But where does your mother come in ? " " That 's just the point , Tad . My plan 's more likely to come off if Mother does n't come into it at all . Bulligan is n't used to women of her sort , and Mother does tend to be helpful . " " Yes , I know , bless her heart . Very well , my boy , no sacrifice is too great . I shall come down with a sudden attack of gastritis and let her doctor me . You would n't mind if I attribute my indisposition to your pancakes and Spam ? It 's got to be something I can recover from quickly , you know . Actually I found them quite good . " " No problem at all . Joe Ragovsky 's going to cook supper , by the way . " " What a pity he did n't do lunch . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not on your life ! I 'd much prefer that you have a miraculous recoveryas a result of tasting his superb cuisine . Even if my plan should work , there 's not much chance of our leaving here tonight . That means somebody will still have to cook breakfast in the morning . I 'd much rather let Joe do the work and reap the glory . "  |p101When  Madoc went back out to the plane with Ace Bulligan 's coffee , he was also carrying Joe Ragovsky 's coat . This was a down-filled parka with a fur-edged hood and a pair of buckskin mittens in the pocket . The garment was a bit heavy for a concert tour at this time of year ; Joe said he 'd brought it along mainly for company . However , the parka was ideal for what Madoc had in mind ; much too big for him , but that was all to the good . It would cover his thighs , even his knees . As for his feet , he could swipe a blanket from the Grumman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee and ate some crackers and peanut butter out of Ed Naxton 's private store , Madoc nipped out to the Moxie Mabel and measured her gas tank with a dipstick . As he 'd suspected , she had more fuel in her than Bulligan had led him to believe . The old pirate must actually have meant to sit tight until he 'd pressured somebodyinto turning over that mythical reward . Well , let him earn it instead . Madoc was gambling on the premise that early airplanes , especially beat-up crates like this one , did n't have much lifting power . When he 'd watched Bulligan come in for his landing , the Moxie Mabel had been cruising at a leisurely rate not more than fifteen or twenty feet off the ground . With an extra hundred and sixty pounds of passenger aboard , it might not even be able to get that high , which meant there would n't be far to fall if the engine dropped out or the wings came off . Of course there was also the possibility that the plane would n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that when it happened . While the coffee was brewing , Madoc had shoved a box of biscuits and a tin of corned beef hash into one of Joe 's pockets , and filled a plastic jug of water . These and a bottle of whiskey , borrowed from MacVittie and Naxton , he stashed in the rear cockpit and hid under thep102parka . He did n't intend to starve in the foothills while waiting for a rescue . Ace could n't have come far on so little juice . Now to get that scoundrel back into his cockpit . That was the hard part . If Bulligan had n't been a man with a thirst , Madoc might never have managed . The aeronaut was greatly disposed at the moment to loll back in his comfortable chair , nurse his hangover , drink his coffee , and regale his captive audience with lies about his flying prowess and scurrilous tales of buggers he had known . Trying not to fret about the dimming daylight and the unnerving possibility of his mother 's leaving Sir Emlyn to that chimerical tummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madoc managed to sort out from Ace 's ramblings that there did exist a ranger 's station not far away , that the ranger had a two-way radio , and that he and his family were well-disposed toward Ace for reasons that Madoc could not even conjecture . " Splendid , Mr. Bulligan ! " he cried . " The very person we want to see . He 'll help us get that whiskey to you in jig-time . Have you any preferenceas to the brand ? How do you want it ? Jugs , barrels , or small bottles you can carry with you at all times ? " Babbling and cajoling , he succeeded in prying Ace loose from the chair and getting him over to the plane . Steve and Ed trailed along behind , wondering what the hell was going on . When they actually saw Madoc put on Joe Ragovsky 's parka and climb into the rear cockpit , they were aghast . " Jesus , Madoc , are you stark , raving crazy ? You 're not going up in that bag of bolts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good enough to twirl the propeller and see if the engine starts ? I believe that 's how it 's done . Is n't it , Mr. Bulligan ? " " Yeah , what the hell . Give ' er a whirl . Maybe somethin ' will happen . Where do you want to go , Mountie ? " " Straight to the ranger station . " " What ranger station ? " Madoc tried not to groan . What , he asked himself , would Sergeant Renfrew have done in a case like this ? " The one you were just telling us about , " he replied through clenched teeth . " Where your friend Ranger Rick lives . The chap with the radio . "  | " Oh , him ? Why in hell did n't you say so ? Sure , I know Rick . Only what if he ai n't home ? " " Then we 'll simply go in and use his radio . Rick wo n't mind . He 's a pal of yours , remember ? " " Is he ? Glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ er rip . Off we go , into the wild blue yonder ! " Being tone-deaf was probably an advantage , Madoc thought , as far as Ace Bulligan 's singing was concerned . Anyway , he did n't get to hear much of it . Steve MacVittie gave the hand-carved propeller a few heaves in a spirit of aeronautical research and , wonder of wonders , the engine started . The old plane crawled forward , bumped across the ground at a snail 's pace , gradually picked up a little speed , and to the astonishment of all present , left the ground . Madoc remembered too late that he 'd forgotten to bring that blanket , but it did n't look as if high-altitude chill was going to cause him any real problem . Moxie Mabel was n't rising much higher than a pan of baking-powder biscuits . That was fine with him until they got over among the rocks , where sudden updrafts and downdrafts added a stimulushe had n't counted on . Ace Bulligan appeared to find them great fun . Madoc did wish the crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at every lurch and joggle . He wished the wheels would n't skim quite so close to the peaks , and he wished those three sets of wings would n't flap so much . He wished it were n't getting dark so fast . He tried to take a detached sightseer 's interest in the scenery so very close below , but those jagged spears of rock failed to appeal . Then he noticed something off to his right , something that looked like a great snake twisting and winding among the humps and jags . A road ! And a house ! And a radio tower ! He leaned forward and patted Ace Bulligan on the back . Ace turned around , showing all seven of his brown snags in a grin of triumph . " There she be . Do n't look like there 's anybody home , eh . I wonder if they took their batteries with ' em . " " Oh Jesus ! " Madoc was not a profane man . His outcry was more in the nature of a supplication , and it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . Two children ran out waving their arms and screaming . Hep104never in his life had seen more appealing moppets . Now if only Ace Bulligan did n't squash them on the way down . No , Ace would n't squash them . A young woman in blue jeans and a green jersey was rounding them up , herding them back toward the house . Now they were all three standing on the doorstep , waving at the plane . Madoc waved back . Ace , he was relieved to note , kept his hands on the joystick and his eyes on the space that had been cleared for a landing strip . At the far end sat a small single-engine plane painted a businesslike forest-green . And here came the man who must be Ranger Rick , swooping the smaller child up to his shoulders , taking the larger one by the hand , walking out to meet them . The triplane settled itself on the ground , well away from the monoplane , and taxied to a halt . Madoc could have sworn he heard the aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , but the sigh might quite possibly have been his own . He leaped to the ground  --  it was only a long step , really  --  and held out his hand . " Ranger Rick , I assume ? I 'm Madoc Rhys . " " Madoc Rhys ? Hey , you 're not by any chance the Mountie who captured Mad Carew , the Murdering Maniac of the Miramichi , singlehanded , all by yourself ? " " Sneaky-lookin ' little bugger , ai n't he ? " Ace Bulligan put insociably . " I brung ' im down from Lodestone Flat . He 's goin ' to get me some whiskey . " Madoc cocked an eyebrow at the ranger . Rick shrugged and nodded . Madoc reached back into the rear cockpit and pulled out the bottle . " There it is , Mr. Bulligan , and thanks for the ride . Why do n't I let Ranger Rick here hold it for you till you 've had some supper ? " " Sure , glad to . " Rick grabbed the whiskey before Bulligan could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , Ace . Ellen will fix you a plate of stew . We were just getting ready to sit down . This is my wife , Inspector . Brian here 's our oldest and Annie 's the runt of the litter . " " So far . " Ellen was noticeably on the way toward a third . " It 's a thrill to meet you , Inspector Rhys . What brings you out here , if it 's all right to ask ? And how in the world did you get up nerve enough to ride with Ace ? I 'd rather face Mad Carew than risk my neck in Moxie Mabel any day . " " I did n't have any choice , actually . Bulligan 's the only one who showed up . I do n't know if you 've heard on the news today that ap105private plane carrying Sir Emlyn and Lady Rhys and a group of singers and members of the Wagstaffe Orchestra was missing ? " " Oh yes , is n't it terrible ? We 've been catching reports on the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calgary , and a car blown right off the road into a cornfield . They 're saying now that the Rhys plane must have crashed with no survivors . My gosh , they 're not relatives of yours ? " " My parents . And I was traveling with them . " " But what are you doing way up here ? " said the ranger . " They 're looking for you down around Montana and Idaho . " " That 's what we 've been afraid of . Apparently the flight plan did n't get corrected . You see , our pilot elected to go above instead of below that freak windstorm or whatever it was , but it caught up with us . We took quite a tossing around , which knocked out our entire electrical system . " " My God ! Did you crash ? How many are left alive ? " " All of us , I 'm glad to say . The pilot pulled off a miracle , gliding in to an almost perfect landing in the dark without any lights , right smack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't believe it ! " cried Ellen . " Neither could we . Nobody was injured and the plane 's intact except for the fact that it ca n't start until it 's repaired and we have no way to fix it . I have to get us some help and call my wife . Bulligan says you have a radio hookup . " " We sure do , and you 're welcome to use it all you want . How about a bit of supper first ? " " Thank you but why do n't you just go ahead and feed the children ? " " An ' me , " said Ace Bulligan . " But I 'm goin ' to have a slug o ' my whiskey first an ' there ai n't no damned Mountie goin ' to stop me . " " All right , but you 've got to drink it out of a tumbler instead of the bottle , " said Ellen . " I 'm not having you teach my children bad man-ners . " Leaving her to cope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madoc into his office , where there was a setup similar to the hotel 's but complete with batteries that worked . " Here we are . We 're on a relay . What you do , Madoc , is just speak your piece into the microphonehere . The chap at the next station will pass the word to head/quarters . They 'll telephone your messages anywhere you want . Where 's your home ? " " Fredericton , New Brunswick . " " They 'll get hold of your wife , never you fear . Just give Frank , that 's the guy at the next station , your home phone number . " Rick was already at the controls , fiddling switches and twiddling dials . " Frank ? Come in , Frank . Hi , Frank , guess who I 've got here , eh . Nope . It 's the Mountie who captured Mad Carew . He was on that missing plane they 've been looking for . It 's down on Lodestone Flat . He 's got to get the word out . Here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned to the chair . " Go ahead , Inspector . " " Hello , Frank ? Madoc Rhys here . Yes , that 's right . No , he did n't give any trouble . The whole affair got blown out of proportion . " Madoc wished by now that he 'd never laid eyes on Mad Carew . " Look , I have to get some messages out right away . Do you have a pencil handy ? " Frank had a pencil . Madoc got down to business . " First , you 'd better let them know at the board of aeronautics that everyone on the plane carrying the Wagstaffe Orchestra group is alive and well , but the plane itself is disabled and we need transport . Do you know Lodestone Flat yourself ? Can you give the precise location and the landing situation ? No , it would be impossible for a jet . They 'll have to come in with a small plane or a big helicopter . " Frank tried to get in another question about Mad Carew . Madoc relentlessly kept to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miners ' Rest Hotel . The owners ought to be notified of what 's happening if there 's any way of reaching them . No , we were n't able to turn on the water or the electricity . We 're using a hand pump in the kitchen and depending on wood fires and oil lamps . Yes , there 's enough to get by on for the moment . Canned foods , dried milk and eggs , flour and so forth . I 'm afraid there wo n't be much left of their stores by the time we leave . They 'll be recompensed , of course . I 'm not sure how that will be handled , but tell them not to worry . " Now for the important part . " You 'll need to get in touch with the office of the Wagstaffe Symphony Orchestra and explain the situation to them . They must have the addresses of all the musicians and , I hope , the singers who were aboard , and can notify their families . " He ran through the names . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Janet Rhys , as well . She wo n't be on their list because I 'm not a member . Yes ,  |p107as  a matter of fact , he 's my father . My mother 's with us , too . No , you need n't do that , my wife will take care of the other relatives . " Madoc gave his home telephone number and made Frank read it back so there could n't be any mistake . " Tell Janet just have them tell her not to worry . I 'll be in touch as soon as I can get to a telephone . Yes , we must have a good chat about Mad Carew one of these days . Right now I have to get off the air so you can get cracking on those messages . Maybe you 'd better have them get hold of my wife first , if you do n't mind . " But Frank had one more question , and it was a good one . " No , " Madoc had to tell him , " we ca n't manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of the hotel 's firewood . First thing in the morning , then ? Absolutely crack of dawn ? Thanks so much , that 's wonderful of you . Good night . " Neither Rick nor Frank had said anything to him about Wilhelm Ochs . They probably thought he was on the case and could n't talk about it . Sensible fellows . As he cut off and stood up , Madoc realized he was sweating like a pig . Was that nerves , or the fact that he was still wearing Joe Ragovsky 's parka ? He slipped off the heavy coat and left it on the chair . " Thanks very much , Rick . That 's a great load off my mind . " " I can imagine . How about a jolt of that rye you brought , and something to eat ? Ellen 's made hunter 's stew and dumplings . Stay the night , if you want to . " " Sounds awfully good but I ought to be getting back . Does that road of yours run up to Lodestone Flat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The people up there will be anxious to know what 's happening . " " Wo n't hurt ' em to wonder another hour or so , will it ? Yes , the road 'll take us there . It 's only about twenty miles . I 'll run you back myself in the wagon after we eat . I expect you 've had just about enough flying for a while . " " How right you are . Right then , let 's have stew and dumplings . I expect it 's canned peas and lamentations up at the hotel . Thank you , Ellen , this is awfully kind of you , " he added as the ranger 's wife handed him a tumbler of rye and water with genuine ice cubes in it . " It 's our pleasure , believe me , " she told him . " We do n't get to see many new faces around here once Lodestone Flat closes for the season.  |p108We  do n't see all that many while it 's open , as far as that goes . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long a drive for what little there is to do . It 's mostly sales conferences and conservation groups , things like that . They fly the parties in and out . " She chatted on , making the most of their unexpected guest while she dished out the food and started the children and Ace , who rather seemed to count as another youngster , eating their supper . Madoc enjoyedhis drink and let himself unwind . After a bit of coaxing and as a courtesy to his rescuers , he related the story of how he 'd tracked the deranged lumberjack through the wilds until a wiggly caterpillar down Carew 's back had tickled the mass murderer into surrendering . For an encore , he told some stories about his parents and the orchestra , which interested Ellen quite a lot , Rick a little , and the children not at all . Then they chatted on about things in general while they ate up an apple pie that was almost but not quite as good as Janet 's . Afterward , he offered to help with the dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally Ranger Rick heaved himself out of his chair . " Well , Madoc , if you really want to get back to Lodestone Flat tonight , I guess we 'd better get started . "  |p109Ace  Bulligan was n't coming with them . After supper , the old man had retired with his bottle to a cot in the shed that the Ricks kept set up for him . He was planning to drink himself into oblivion , though he did n't phrase his intentions in quite those words . Madoc had a few qualms of conscience about having provided Ace with the means to do so , but Rick told him to forget it . " Ace manages to get fried one way or another whenever he feels the urge . He 's got a still out behind that shack of his where he boils down anything he can get his hands on . " " Yes , he told us about the still . He claims that 's what he flies his plane on . " " And so he does , when he ca n't wheedle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell he keeps that cussed old thing in the air is beyond me . Black magic , I guess . " " I just hope he does n't try to fly it blind drunk . " Madoc was still feeling a trifle guilty . " Do n't fret yourself . He 'll sleep off the whiskey and Ellen will get a decent breakfast into him before he takes off again . We feed him up two or three times a week . " " Good Lord ! Is that all he lives on ? " " Oh no . He gets the Old Age Security Pension and Supplement , and makes a few dollars in the summertime up at the flat , charging tourists to get their pictures taken with him and Moxie Mabel . He 'd like to give rides , but the hotel folks wo n't let him . Do n't want their front yard cluttered with mangled corpses , and I ca n't say I blame ' em . I do n't know who 'd be damned fool enough to go up with him , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry , Inspector . Guess I put my foot in it that time . "  | " Believe me , " Madoc assured him , " if I 'd known you were only twenty miles away , I 'd much rather have hoofed it . The trouble was , I could n't get any sense out of Bulligan about where the road led to and how far I 'd have to go to find a radio . Is he really as crazy as he makes himself out to be ? " " Ace is crazy , all right , but he 's foxy , too . I gave up trying to figure him out long ago . Somehow or other , Ace always seems to land on his own feet . Wearing somebody else 's shoes , like as not . Say , I did n't like to mention it in front of the kids , but what about that guy who got poisoned on stage in the middle of the concert ? " " Actually he did n't , " Madoc replied . " You heard it was ricin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news . " " Yes , that 's right , ricin . Comes from castor oil beans , does n't it ? " " So I understand . We had a case some time back . Ricin is slow-acting as a good many of those vegetable poisons are . That means Wilhelm Ochs , the chap who died , must have ingested it quite a while before the concert , probably mixed in with something he ate . He was a real glutton , from what the other musicians tell me . I never got to meet him , myself . " Madoc saw no harm in giving Rick a brief rundown on the various orchestra members . They 'd be written up in the papers anyway , no doubt . Loyalty to his parents , not to mention his calling , demanded of course that he keep certain information to himself , such as Delicia Fawn 's auditions and the fact that Madame Bellini was once Mrs. WilhelmOchs . Was the concertmaster actually intending to marry Bellini and had she ever been divorced from Ochs ? Houdon was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that doing anythingnot wholly en regle . He ought to have talked to the pair before this , Madoc thought . But he 'd been too busy in the kitchen . The road was n't great , but they had it all to themselves . They made the distance in a little over half an hour . The ride up in Rick 's wagon had been a lot more pleasant than his peak-skimming trip down ; still , Madoc was relieved to spy the oil lamps in the front windows of the Miners ' Rest . This must have been how they welcomed weary prospectorscoming in from their claims with their pokes of dust , or sacks of ore , or whatever it was they 'd mined for around here . It occurred to him that he had n't got around to asking , and that right now he did n't give a rap.  |p111Ed  and Steve must have spread the word about his having gone off with Ace Bulligan . He got a full-dress reception from the entire company , including Lucy Shadd in a Black Watch tartan bathrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " By the way , " Madoc had to murmur when it came time for introductions , starting of course with Lady Rhys . " Is Rick your first name or your last ? " " Both ; it 's Richard Rick . Do n't ask me what my parents were thinking of at the time . How do you do , ma'am ? This is a real honor for me . " " The honor is ours , I assure you . " Lady Rhys had n't put on her black gown and diamonds , but she could be just as impressive without them . " We are delighted to see you . Tell me , Mr. Rick , have you been able to let people know where we are ? " " Oh yes , we got the word out . To the next relay station , anyway . They 'll pass the word along , never you fear . There wo n't be a plane in here tonight . Trying to land in the dark would be too dangerous , so you all might as well go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much sleep last night , eh ? Do n't worry , you 'll have plenty of company come morning . " Most of the group were concerned as to whether their families had been notified , but Lucy Shadd wanted more . " What time in the morning ? What sort of plane ? Or will it be a bus ? Who 's supposed to provide breakfast ? Are they bringing milk and eggs ? " " We do n't know anything about anything yet , " Madoc had to keep replying . " Ranger Rick has explained to you that his radio is on a relay . The only person we got to talk to was the ranger at the next station along the line . He promised to pass on our messages so they could be telephoned to the right people . " " For God 's sake , Madoc , how stupid can you be ? Could n't you have waited for the answers ? " " And leave us wondering whether our son had crashed in the mountains , risking his neck with that crazy old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was a near-miss . " Lucy , you forget yourself . You know as well as I that it 's going to take time for arrangements to be made . " " But we have to find out what they are . " " We 'll find out when the time comes . There 's not a blessed thing we can do about them anyway . I suggest you nip on back to bed and save your fretting until you 've something to fret about . Mr. Rick , Sir Emlynp112and I are immensely grateful for your efforts on behalf of us all , and particularly for your kindness to our son . Would you care to come into the hotel ? Our hospitality is limited , but we 'd be happy to offer you a cup of tea . Or perhaps a drink ? " " Thanks , Lady Rhys , but we just got up from the supper table . I expect likely I ought to get back home and find out what 's happening on the radio . I wish I 'd had an extra battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , but it just so happens I had to lend out my spare and have n't had a chance to replace it yet . I 'll most likely be up in the morning if something important comes along . Anything else you can think of before I go that you 'd like to have transmitted ? " Lucy Shadd thought of several things . However , it turned out Madoc and Rick had thought of them , too . Frustrated , she picked up the skirt of her long robe so she would n't trip over it and went back into the hotel . Most of the others , especially the Rhyses , stayed to see Rick off . By the time no glow from his headlights was visible , they were all yawning . As soon as they got inside , just about everybody headed for the stairs . Jacques-Marie Houdon was a barely discreet four steps behind Norma Bellini , Madoc noted with no great feeling of disappointment . That projected conversation would have to wait till morning . Too bad . He was damnably tired himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Madoc get to bed before he undermined the family 's dignity by falling on his face . That was as good an excuse as any . Going through the lobby , Madoc noticed that Cedric Rintoul was seated over in a corner by the window with David Gabriel , another orchestra member Madoc had n't yet got around to chatting with . Gabriel had the lamp at his shoulder and his hands busy with some finicky task . Making another reed for his oboe , no doubt . Madoc still had n't checked on those wire cutters , but they probably did n't matter . Rintoul had one of the hotel 's thick tumblers balanced on his knee . Whiskey or brandy , Madoc supposed , to make him sleep . He or Gabriel , as the last ones , would no doubt bring that lamp along to light their way upstairs . The stove was dampered down for the night . Joe Ragovsky had probably seen to that . They would n't have to be thinking about such tasks this time tomorrow . Madoc went into the bedroomp113where Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and followed Ed 's sterling example . Nobody screamed , nobody thumped around the hallway . Madoc slept straight through till the watch he 'd adjusted by the Ricks ' kitchen clock said six o'clock . He got up , splashed his face and brushed his teeth with cold water from the pitcher he 'd brought up last night , got into his last clean shirt in anticipation of the rescuers who , God willing , would be arriving before long , and went downstairs . It was cold again , colder than yesterday morning . They 'd be getting away from here none too soon . He fed the lobby stove and opened the damper to make the fire burn hotter , went out to the kitchen , and fell over Cedric Rintoul . Passed out , the bloody soak . Could n't he have picked a less awkward place to sleep it off instead of lying down in front of the stove like a damned great Saint Bernard ? Madoc gave the gross body a none too gentle nudge with his toe . " Rintoul , wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to wake anybody else . Evidently he did n't speak loudly enough to do any good . Rintoul did n't stir . Madoc leaned over to give the trombone player a shake , and found out why . It was a waste of time trying to wake somebody who had an icepick rammed into the back of his neck . " Oh my God , another one ! " That was n't much of an epitaph , and Madoc was slightly relieved there 'd been nobody around to hear him say it . Now what to do ? First , he must make doubly sure Rintoul was indeed beyond the veil . There could be no doubt about that ; one touch told him the body was cold as an iceberg and stiff as a boot . Death must have been virtually instantaneous , he thought ; one quick stab straight into the base of the brain . Bold , resolute , but not bloody . Hardly a trickle showing , as far as Madoc could see in the none too good light . There 'd have been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody had known enough not to do that , and also had been clever enough not to leave any fingerprints on the handle , most likely . Still , Madoc was n't going to touch the icepick itself , just in case . He 'd have to find a camera ; surely there must be at least one shutterbug in the party . Rintoul must not be moved until photographs had been taken of the body in its present position.  |p114That  meant not being able to get at the stove , which in turn meant no hot water and no tea , until Madoc remembered his mother 's trick with the fancy stove in the lobby . He hooked the kettle toward him with a long toasting fork , regretted the fact that whatever water had been in it last night was now simmered away , and filled it fresh at the pump . He was lifting the curlicues off the lobby stove when his father came downstairs in the scruffy brown Jaeger robe Madoc had known since his knee-perching days . " Ah , son , good morning . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pop around here . " " Sorry , Tad , but they 've already started . We have a problem in the kitchen . " " Not the water pump ? " " No , Rintoul . He 's dead . " " Madoc , no ! God help me , if I 've driven the man to suicide  --  " " Tad , he 's got an icepick jabbed into the back of his neck . " Sir Emlyn stood perfectly still while Madoc got the kettle on the stove , then raised his right hand in the decisive upward flick he used when he was about to give the downbeat . " I 'll have a look . " He walked ahead of Madoc into the kitchen and stood over the huddleon the floor . " Poor , poor fellow . No , I agree with you , Rintoul would not have found this an amusing joke to play on himself What now , son ? " " You did n't happen to bring a camera with you ? " " No . There are always too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick of cameras long ago . Carlos Pitney has one , I know . Photography is quite a hobby of his . Shall I wake him up and ask if we may borrow it ? " " I 'll go if you like . " " I 'd rather go myself , son . Carlos and I are old friends , and murder before breakfast is not a pleasant thing to be wakened for . " " I 'll have your shaving water ready for you . " It was the best that Madoc could do . " Thank you , Madoc . I suppose you know the press will be here before anyone else . Will you have to tell them ? " Madoc sighed . He also had had experience with the zealous folk of the media . News of the downed plane would have reached them last night ; they were probably on their way already.  | " Here 's the drill , Tad . It 's any citizen 's duty to report a murder to whatever law enforcement officer is most readily available . That 's myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as Rick shows up , I 'll find out from him who has jurisdiction over the area and ask him to get a message through as quickly as possible . It 's the local man 's job to release the information about Rintoul 's death , not mine . In the meantime , I 'll have to proceed with the investigation , which I 'll do as expeditiouslyand as discreetly as I can . " " That 's better than I 'd have dared to hope . This is going to be terrible publicity , you know . First Ochs , then Shadd , now Rintoul . People will be coming not to hear our music but to see who 's going to get murdered next . It is a hateful thing to think of . " " Let 's not worry about Shadd , anyway . I expect Lucy herself would rather we kept that incident quiet as long as we can . As soon as we 've got our photographs and checked for whatever evidence there may be , we 'd better move Rintoul 's body out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be possible to keep his death a secret from the rest ofthe party until after the media people have come and gone , but we cantry . " Somebody already knows , Madoc . " " Oh yes , no doubt about that . It 's quite possible two or three others know , too . Anyone who happened to come down to the kitchen last night for a late snack or a drink or whatever could hardly have failed to discover the body . " " And not said anything because they saw no point in disturbing our rest when there was nothing to be done , you think ? " " And not said anything for fear of getting hit with a murder charge themselves , more likely . I should say from the look of him that Rintoul 's been there for quite a while . He 's still dressed as he was last night . He may have been killed not long after I myself saw him last . " " That would have been around the time your mother and I went to bed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . Rintoul and Gabriel were the only two left in the lobby when I went . The pair of them were sitting over there in the corner by the window , as you may recall . There was a lamp on the sill . " " Yes , your mother put it there to light her wandering boy back home . We were worried about you , Madoc. "  | " That 's all right , Tad . I was worried about me , too . Anyway , Gabriel was working at something or other under the light . One of his eternal reeds , I suppose . Rintoul was nursing a drink . Not his first , I 'd say offhand . They seemed content enough at the time , but the stove had been banked for the night and it would n't have been long before they began to find the room uncomfortably chilly . " " Could n't they have opened the damper and put on more wood ? " " Yes , but I doubt if they did . I expect Gabriel 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs leaving Rintoul by himself , which may quite possibly be the truth . Rintoul may have said something about fixing himself another drink . Anyway , the odds are that 's what he went to the kitchen for . Somebody grabbed the chance and stuck the icepick into his neck . " " Dreadful ! " Sir Emlyn shook his head . " But simple enough . The icepick would be the one that was in that rack next to the sink , I suppose . I saw it yesterday when I was washing dishes . " " Yes , and I noticed it was gone from the rack this morning . You 'd better get that camera , Tad , before somebody else wakes up and comes looking for breakfast . You can tell Pitney you want to photograph the first press plane coming in . " " I would not lie to my friend . Furthermore , I am hoping Carlos will come himself to work the camera . He 's quite expert , and his discretion is impeccable . " Softly , in his old-fashioned felt slippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , took out the flashlight he 'd stashed in the kitchen cupboard against emergencies , and used it to take a closer look at the ungainly sprawl that had been Cedric Rintoul.  |p117Without  moving the body , he could n't see much . Rintoul had fallen face down with his hands doubled under him . Madoc did find the tumblerhe 'd been drinking from ; it had rolled under the stove . The indicationwas that he 'd dropped it when he fell . Since Rintoul had n't lifted a hand yesterday to tidy up after himself , it was unlikely he was bringing the tumbler back to be washed . More probably , he 'd been meaning to get himself another drink , and that was interesting . He could n't have been worried about getting murdered . Yesterday morning Rintoul , along with everybody else , had heard Ace Bulligan talking about that early news bulletin . Last night , he 'd heard Madoc and Rick confirm the report that Wilhelm Ochs had been poisoned . Maybe he 'd thought he knew who 'd murdered Ochs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . Maybe he knew the real killer was here at the Miners ' Rest , and had been stabbed because he could n't be trusted not to tell . Maybe he himself had killed Ochs , and had been murdered out of revenge . Had Norma Bellini nee Belschi , late Ochs , felt it her duty to avenge the death of her former husband ? Would she have chosen an icepick to do the job ? Why not ? Icepicks made excellent weapons because their points were so sharp and their shafts so slender . A woman with plenty of weight behind her could drive one in easily enough , assuming she knew just where to set the point . Maybe La Bellini had n't been bent on vengeance , merely anxious to shut Rintoul 's ever-flapping mouth before he told her current lover about her having been married to Ochs . Or maybe this had nothing at all to do with Ochs . Maybe Frieda Loye had finally decided she 'd had as much of Rintoul as she was going to take . Maybe Corliss Blair had killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason Jasper had got tired of being second banana . Among all the maybes , Madoc could sort out one incontrovertible fact which he had n't had the heart to mention to his father . If the question of who 'd stabbed the prankish trombonist was not resolved before their rescue plane , bus , truck , or mule team came along , the local law officer would have every right to keep them here in Lodestone Flat until it was . He was somewhat relieved when his father came back with Carlos Pitney and an impressive-looking Nikon in tow . Pitney allowed himself one quick , " God help us , what a thing to happen ! " then got down to business . He took a quick reading on his exposure meter , then began to snap . He knew about angles . His flash worked every time . Madoc had no doubt whatever that the photographs would be excellent . In about five minutes ' time , Pitney had finished his job . Madoc wrapped a clean cup towel around his hand , took a careful grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pulled it out . Pitney took a couple more shots of Madoc performing the operation so that there 'd be no doubt that it was he who 'd done so . Madoc then laid the weapon , wrapped loosely in the towel , inside a long candle box he 'd found in the pantry , and put the cover on the box . " Thanks a lot . Here , Tad , hold this . Now if you and I , Carlos , can lift Rintoul very carefully away from the stove and lay him on this blanket you so intelligently brought down with you , we 'll get him out to the shed . " Madoc had no great hope of learning anything from the state of the floor . It was nothing but rough wooden planks with a few squares of linoleum at strategic areas , all of them by now hopelessly tracked up . The urgent task right now was to get Rintoul out of sight . Already a few creaks from overhead told them that some of the people upstairs were beginning to stir . Madoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd managewithout him . He himself was a good deal stronger than he looked and while Rintoul had been big , Carlos Pitney was even bigger . The two of them got the body wrapped in the blanket and safely stowed in the shed while Sir Emlyn , with great presence of mind , fetched the now boiling kettle off the lobby stove , restored the iron curlicue to its proper place , and made a pot of tea . By the time the self-appointed pallbearersp119came back , he was setting out mugs and powdered milk in the coziest manner possible . Madoc had brought back an armload of firewood , with which he quickly stoked the big kitchen range . Carlos Pitney was snapping a photo of the father and son sipping their tea by the time Joe Ragovsky came downstairs already dressed for the day . " Hey , what 's this , a pajama party ? I thought I was going to be the first one down . " " Ah , you Canadian wheat farmers are no match for us Welsh sheep herders , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been an accomplice in a clandestine concealment of a murdered man . " I had intended to fetch myself some shaving water so that I could uphold my well-known dignity among you by appearing clean and unwhiskered , but as you can see , I got sidetracked . Sit down , Ragovsky . Have we anything left to eat , I wonder ? " " Not a heck of a lot , " Joe replied . " There 's flour and baking powder and canned shortening . And jam . I thought I might whomp us up some hot biscuits to tide us over till the relief plane gets here . They 'd be better than nothing , anyway . " " A good deal better , I have no doubt , " said Pitney in that deep organ tone even Madoc could appreciate . " Let me pour you a mug of tea first . Sir Emlyn made it . I never knew you were so handy around the kitchen , Em . " As Joe was throwing dry ingredients together and cutting in the shortening , Pitney lolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sumptuous maroon cashmere bathrobe with gold piping . " You know , I would n't mind coming back here sometime , with you fellows to cook for me . And the plumbing hooked up . " And no bodies in the woodshed . Madoc admired the basso 's aplomb ; Pitney 'd been looking a trifle unnerved back there watching Madoc go through Rintoul 's pockets . Madoc still had n't had a chance to decide whether he 'd come across something important . From the sounds he was catching now , he would n't get much opportunity for cogitation any time soon . " Tad , " he said , " you 'd better grab that kettle and slide back to your room . I think I hear a plane . " That might , of course , be only Ranger Rick in his little puddlejumper . It might , God forbid , be Ace Bulligan coming back for morep120booze . Leaving Joe to finish the biscuits , Madoc went outside to check . No , this was a bigger plane than Rick 's , though not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back inside to report . Pitney was gone . The kitchen was crammed with pitcher-carriers , all of them clamoring for hot water and not getting any . Nobody had thought to fill the reservoir in the stove or the wash boiler that had served so well the night before . Ainsworth Kight was taking the oversightas a personal affront . Nobody else was paying any attention to him . Jason Jasper was trying to work the pump and not having much luck . Joe Ragovsky was still cutting biscuits . Joe 's curly golden beard made an agreeable contrast to the unshaven cheeks around him . Madoc felt his own ill-shaven chin and wished he 'd kept the mustache he 'd sacrificed during his courting days . Janet had complained that it prickled when he kissed her ; but Janet , alas , was not here to be kissed . He took the pump handle from Jasper and got down to business . The sound of the plane could be heard now even over the creaking and splashing of the pump and the gabble of the pitcher-bearers . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she morning fresh with not a hair out of place . Both were in their British tweeds , ready to do credit to Sir Emlyn 's position , thereby to the WagstaffeSymphony Orchestra , thence to the festival . They bore their heavy responsibilities well , Madoc thought with pride . By the time he 'd got all the pitchers filled , the plane was circling over Lodestone Flat . Going outside again , this time with his parents , Madoc could easily read the lettering on its side . BUED , in red and orange with a green line around the edges . A television crew , beyond a doubt . Madoc endured his mother 's scrutiny , held up his chin as she tried to straighten his collar , then ducked back into the hotel . His aim was to maintain the lowest profile possible and try to get some work done . He 'd found a key in the woodshed door . It was n't much of one , merely the old iron sort that would probably fit any of the doors in the hotel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lock and slipped it into his pocket . Now he nipped back into the kitchen and offered to keep an eye on the biscuits so Joe Ragovsky could go out to watch the plane land . As soon as Joe was gone , Madoc unlocked the door again and slipped into the cold woodshed . He and Pitney had laid Rintoul on the floor , over at the right-handp121side of the shed where there was n't much of anything except a few chairs and nightstands the hotel keepers were perhaps intending to repaintbefore their season began next spring . A couple of these with a tarpaulin draped over them had made an adequate screen to conceal the trombone player 's remains from anybody who might happen to catch a glimpse inside . Madoc ducked under the improvised tent and knelt beside the body . After another , more painstaking examination , he decided he 'd been right the first time . There was not one blessed thing about the body that even suggested a clue as to who 'd wielded the icepick . This had been either a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back and check on those biscuits . And a good thing he did . The stove was burning really hot now . Another couple of minutes and the biscuits would have been burning , too . Madoc reached in with a potholder and pulled out a huge roasting pan filled with puffy , well-browned , good-smelling humps . Joe was without question a sound man on biscuits . To confirm his appraisal , Madoc extracted one of them from the pan , split it , anointed the halves with dabs of regrettably sweet marmalade which was the best the larder had to offer , and ran a consumer test . Yes , Joe knew his biscuits . Madoc only wished he could be sure of what else Joe knew . Had Ragovsky meant to be first in the kitchen only out of the goodness of his heart , or because he 'd remembered there was a cadaver to be tidied away before the biscuits could be baked ? The plane was landing . The people from upstairs who 'd been franticallymaking themselves presentable for this moment streamed down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head straight for the front door . " Hi , Madoc . Any coffee going ? " " It seems to have got all used up yesterday . There 's tea , if you do n't mind it slightly stewed . " " Hell , no . I 've been stewed a few times , myself . Caffeine 's caffeine , is n't it ? " Ed picked up the big brown teapot that had been left to keep warm on the back of the stove , and poured himself a mugful . " How come you 're not outside getting your picture taken with the rest of the bigwigs ? " " I had to stay around and watch the biscuits . Would you care for one ? So it 's a television crew , eh ? I thought it must be when I saw thep122plane circling just now . My father predicted they 'd be the first to show up . " Yeah , just our luck . Steve and I were hoping for a mechanic , or at least some word from Mr. Zlubert . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he 's the owner 's right-hand man . Private secretary , I guess they call him . The owner 's off to Paris on the Concorde this week , which is how come he was bighearted enough to lend his plane to the orchestra , though they probably do n't know that . Anyway , whatever they do for the rest of you , I expect Steve and I will be stuck here till the plane 's repaired and we can fly her out . Steve 's going to be one lonesome guy when Delicia leaves . Say , these are n't bad biscuits . Be better if we had something besides jam to put on ' em , though . Not to complain about the grub we 've been having , but I 'll sure be one happy man when I can sit down to a great big steak and fried potatoes . Come on , let 's go take a look . " " Why not ? " Ed would think it strange if he did n't , Madoc supposed . " Just let me set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody else wants tea . Tea and biscuits are all we have for breakfast , I 'm afraid . " " Better than nothing . " Ed took another one as they left the kitchen . " You make these yourself ? " " No , Joe Ragovsky did . " " Oh yeah , the big guy with the yellow beard . You know , it 's funny to think of Joe playing a fiddle for his living . He looks as if he ought to be out driving a tractor or something . " " I expect Joe 's driven one plenty of times . He grew up on a wheat farm , he tells me . Well , well , we seem to be just in time for the main event . " Delicia Fawn was beating them out the door . She 'd got herself up in what could perhaps best be described as a sports outfit , and it left no doubt as to what her favorite sport must be . The green and beige plaid skirt stopped short of her knees and was slit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk shirt had been bought a size too small and left unbuttoned a good way below the point of discretion . She 'd thrown a bulky knit green cardigan over her shoulders , arranging it so as to conceal nothing of importance . Her hair was an artful tumble , her lips a crimson pout of welcome . Once he 'd spied Delicia , the cameraman lost any interest in thep123downed plane , the stranded orchestra , the distinguished conductor , and even the conductor 's impressive wife . The effervescent chap with the microphone almost trampled poor little Frieda Loye underfoot in his rush to get at this delectable new goodie . Madoc realized he need not have worried about becoming a center of attention . These people did n't even know he was here . " Good work , " said the announcer after he and the cameraman had explored the possibilities as far as limitations would permit . " Now how about some indoor shots ? You orchestra chaps get your instruments and make believe you 're rehearsing , eh . Delicia baby , how about if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fawn is not the only singer present , " Ainsworth Kight observedin a lofty and disapproving tone . " Oh yeah ? Who else ? " Sir Emlyn was having a hard time , Madoc could tell . This brash exploitation must be disgusting to him , yet he could n't afford to antagonizethe media on account of the orchestra 's already precarious position with regard to public relations . He turned to his wife , who sailed forward in her grandest dame manner . " Perhaps you have n't yet realized , sir , that we have with us not only several first chair musicians of the Wagstaffe Symphony Orchestra but also four of Canada 's most distinguished classical singers . Allow me to present Ainsworth Kight , whom we 're privileged to have as our tenor soloist on our festival tour . Madame Norma Bellini , whom you will of course remember from her superb solo recital last month in Stratford , is our contralto , and the great Carlos Pitney is our bass . " " Super ! They can all sing . " Lady Rhys gave the announcer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply not possible for singers of their caliber to belt out a little song on the spur of the moment . Their voices are both precious and delicate instruments . Just to get them warmed up would take a good deal more time than I expect you want to spend here . Might I suggest instead that we take the camera indoors and show you how we 've been camping out in this quaint old hotel since our plane was forced down ? You know how viewers love these little behind-the-scenes glimpses of famous peo-pie . " The publicity might also soften the hotel owners into taking a morep124lenient view of the company 's depredations . Lady Rhys was naturally too intelligent to say so . " That is an idea to which we cheerfully subscribe , Lady Rhys , " boomed Carlos Pitney . " If these gentlemen want , we could even duplicatethe scene after our heroic Mr. MacVittie had brought us safely to the ground , all of us huddled around that picturesque old stove in the lobby , drinking tea in a state of shock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Delicia can be passing around the cups . And Madame Bellini pouring the tea , " he added out of the kindness of his heart . Madame Bellini was not going to play . " It is for head of operations to pour tea , " she growled . " I do not make public display of myself in such manner . Excuse , please , I go back to my room . This cold air is not good for my throat . "  |p125All  the time she 'd been standing out there , Madame Bellini had been keeping a lacy black woolen stole wound around her head and across her face like a yashmak . She tucked its folds more securely around her mouth and nose , and stalked back into the hotel . Madoc was not a bit surprised . To be acclaimed on the concert stage as the incomparable Norma Bellini was one thing . To appear on television screens all over Canada and risk getting herself recognized by some former landlord or postman as the ex-wife of the suddenly deceased Wilhelm Ochs would be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluptuous distractions , the announcer had not yet thought to mention the French horn player 's mysterious death . He 'd get around to it , no doubt , over the tea and biscuits . Madoc could only be thankful Carlos Pitney had suggested the lobby instead of the kitchen . The farther everybody could be kept away from that woodshed door , the better . As for himself , it was easy enough to fade quietly out of the crowd and into the kitchen . He filled the kettle , which his father had been thoughtful enough to bring back downstairs , and was putting mugs on a tray to take to the lobby when Lucy Shadd bustled in , reeking with efficiency after her day 's layoff . She was dressed in her trim gray suit , not a wrinkle in it . Except for the scarf  --  a flowered silk one today  --  wound high around her neck , nobody would have had a clue to what had befallen her yesterday . Even that was n't any real clue . Any woman could wear a scarf for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What are you bothering with a tray for ? Why do n't you just set the mugs on the table ? " was her cheery greeting . " Because they 're going to have breakfast around the stove in thep126lobby for the benefit of the cameraman , " Madoc replied with what patience he could muster . " That 's a stupid idea . Why not here , where they can eat in some kind of comfort ? " " We would n't be able to fit everybody around the table . " " You did yesterday . " " No , we did n't . People had to eat in relays . You were n't here , " Madoc had to remind her , " so you would n't have known . If we did squeeze them all into the kitchen , there 'd be no room left for the cameraman . Anyway , we 've nothing to eat this morning except tea and biscuits . They can manage those easily enough on their laps . " " Well , I still think it 's a stupid arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their biscuits , and that 's two dishes to juggle . " " They could set their mugs on their plates if we were planning to give them plates , which I see no reason to do . " " Then how do you expect them to manage the jam ? " " Lucy , these are not puling infants . They 're grown men and women . " " That 's what you think . They 'll spill the jam on their clothes and I 'll get stuck with taking the stuff to the cleaner 's in Vancouver because everything will be in a last-minute flurry by the time we get to the festival . Do n't you know yet when the relief plane 's coming ? " " I have no more idea than I did the last time you asked me . Those chaps out there have n't a clue and show no sign of caring . All they want is to get their story and be off . " " Huh . I 'd better go see if I can get any sense out of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sort . It 's my father 's place to deal with the media , and he 's edgy enough already . Here , let me carry that trayful of mugs for you . " " I 'm not helpless . Bring the teapot and the bloody damned biscuits . " Madoc would have preferred to pour the tea over her head , but this was hardly the time to provoke another scene . He gathered his own trayful of spoons , knives , and jam , along with bowls of sugar and the powdered milk they were all so sick of by now , took them to the lobby , set them on the counter , and went back for the teapot and the big platter of biscuits . Lucy began pouring out mugs of tea and handing them around . Delicia followed with the biscuits . She 'd discarded the heavy sweater so that the camera could get the full benefit of her bendings and twitch/ings . Madoc still could n't work up any amorous yearnings but he was most humbly and fervently grateful for her diversionary abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the woodshed door and fetch more boiling water for the teapotwhen he heard the drone of a second airplane . Hoping it might be somebody useful , he went to take a look , but it was just another television crew from a different network . Its pilot just managed to skin his plane in between the previous arrival and the grounded Grumman . Lodestone Flat was beginning to look like a parking lot . All they needed now was Ace Bulligan in Moxie Mabel . Please God , they would n't get him . They would n't be able to get anybody else , either , until one of these TV crews pulled out . Already a third plane was buzzing angrily around the inadequate landing field , circling wide to inspect the rocky dirt road over which Madoc had driven last night with Ranger Rick , wisely thinking better of trying to land there , and going off . Madoc walked out to the two parked planes , whose respective pilots were now amicably engaged in shoptalk . " Did either of you chaps happen to catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did they mention who they were ? " " No , " said the first arrival , " they just asked how soon we were going to get the hell out of here so they could come down . I told ' em we should n't be much longer . We 'll need to get the films and tapes back in time to be processed for the late morning news . They 'll be back , do n't you worry . " " I certainly hope so . There 's always the off chance they 've thought to bring a bag of hamburgers with them . " " Pickings getting a bit slim in there , are they ? " " More than a bit , I 'm afraid . " Madoc stayed and made desultory conversation with the two pilots until the first television crew came out , with Delicia waving bye-bye from the hotel steps . No sooner was their plane airborne than the third one was winging back in heading for its space . This time it was a gaggle of newspaper reporters and yet another cameraman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to leave , there were two more circling . Madoc stuck his head in the cockpit of the one on the ground and heard the two overhead pilots sputtering at each other about which had priority to land.  | " Break in and tell them we want the one that is n't press , " he begged his new acquaintance . " All this picture-taking is n't going to do the orchestra any good unless we get out of here . " The pilot grinned . " What makes you think they want you out of here ? You 're a damned good story and there 's nothing else on the wire this morning . Cheer up , brother , there are lots more cameras where these came from . " Yet another airplane appeared over the ridge , a small green one that Madoc recognized . He said a word of which his mother would not have approved and grabbed the microphone . " Look here , fellows , that plane up there is from the local ranger station with some important radio messages for us . For God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't about to yield . When the second camera crew came out , the silver plane had already asserted its precedence over both the red one and the green one , and was on its way down . Ranger Rick dipped his wings in resignation and headed back across the peak . Gone to get his car , Madoc hoped . No sense in trying to fight a losing battle . Now who was this new affliction ? A dapper middle-aged man with a bald head and a briefcase was stepping out of the silver plane . He lost not a second in getting down to business . " Where are MacVittie and Naxton ? " " Mr. Zlubert ? " said Madoc . That stopped him for a second . " Why yes . How did you know ? " " Wishful thinking , I suppose . Ed Naxton was just saying he hoped you 'd turn up . Would you care to go inside and get your picture taken for television , or shall I send your chaps out ? " " Young man , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now . " " Yes , sir . " Madoc thought about touching his forelock but decided not to . He went in and found Ed and Steve still sitting at the edge of the circle around the lobby stove , looking bored . He reached over and tapped Ed , who happened to be nearer , on the shoulder . " You 're wanted outside . Mr. Zlubert 's here . " " Great ! " The two pilots raced for the door . Madoc edged his way among the chairs to where his father was trying not to look bored and not quite succeeding . " Sorry to interrupt , Sir Emlyn , but could you possibly cutp129this short ? The people are here about the Grumman , and we have a stacking problem overhead . " " A what ? Oh , you mean there are other planes wanting to land ? " " There were three a moment ago . The ranger was here but he could n't find a place to park so he went away again . " " Madoc , this is terrible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automatically , Sir Emlyn cast a beseeching glance at Lady Rhys . She at once stood up and began shaking hands with the dumbfounded mediarepresentatives . " We are most grateful for your interest in our plight . Thank you so much for coming . Perhaps we shall have the pleasure of seeing you again under less difficult circumstances . Madoc , will you see these kind people to their planes ? " " I 'll do it ! " Lucy Shadd was off and running again . Madoc did n't try to stop her . That one biscuit he 'd eaten so long ago was no more than a faint memory , and faint would be the operable word if he did n't get something more substantial inside him fairly soon . The platter was so empty it gleamed , but there must be something edible left in the kitchen . There was also , of course , the matter of Rintoul in the woodshed . Fortunately the interviewees were drifting out onto the flat instead of back to the kitchen . Madoc collected a trayful of used mugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up some more of the postbreakfastdebris and followed him . " What are you planning to do about our little dilemma , Madoc ? " the basso murmured . " Fume and sweat , until I can get hold of Rick and find out who 's the law around here . Have people been asking for Rintoul ? " " He has not been greatly missed . The consensus appears to be that he 's keeping a low profile in the hope that your father will soften enough to let him play at the festival . Cedric is variously assumed to be lurking in his bedroom or communing with nature somewhere out back . I have gently encouraged the latter view . It is , after all , closer to the truth . Is there any hope of our being taken out ? " " I could n't say , but I expect we 'll find out pretty soon . The assistant to that big shot who lent us the plane has arrived . I hope he brought a mechanic with him , but I was n't given the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the stars ? "  | " Oh , I expect Ainsworth can do enough starring for both of us . He eats that stuff up , he and Dellie Baby . " " Madame Bellini does n't go for it much , would you say ? " " Not a bit . Norma 's a lady in the old-fashioned sense . I suppose you know what 's going on , Madoc , but , you must n't be misled by appearances . She and Jacques-Marie are a respectable married couple in all but the legal sense . The hitch is that they 're both staunch Catholics . " " Ah . " Madoc wished he 'd known sooner . " Is Houdon a married man ? " " A widower of many years ' standing . He 's older than Norma , as you may have gathered . " " So Ochs was the only fly in the ointment ? " Carlos Pitney 's eyebrows shot all the way up to his silvery hairline . " Do you know , Madoc , that had n't once entered my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd probably have kept my mouth shut . How did you find out Norma was married to Ochs ? " " Lucy Shadd told me . She and Ochs had been friends from way back . She seems to be under the impression that the marriage had been dissolvedsome time ago , but I assume what you 're saying is that Mrs. Ochs 's religious scruples did n't allow the divorce . Rintoul was such a pal of Ochs that he may well have known they were still married . It begins to look as if Houdon 's the only one who 's still in the dark . Have you any information on the matter ? I 'm sure I need n't remind you that , while loyalty to friends and colleagues is an admirable quality , it 's out of place in a murder investigation . " " Yes , I understand that . To the best of my knowledge , Madoc , Houdon does not know . That is , he 's been aware there was a husband somewhere . I suspect Norma may have spun him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something of the sort . The truth would hardly have appealed to Houdon 's aesthetic sensibilities , from what I saw of Ochs during our brief acquaintance . And of course it would have been extremely awkward for Houdon , being in the same orchestra with that buffoon . " " What happened when Bellini showed up with my father and the rest ? Did Ochs show any sign of recognizing her as his wife ? " " If he did , I was n't aware of it . But then , I would n't be . Orchestra members look on visiting singers as mere temporary nuisances , you know . With a few obvious exceptions . "  |p131Pitney  smiled a trifle sadly . " Norma was n't acting particularly worried , if that 's what you 're getting at . Theirs had not been a bitter separation , she told me one night in Paris after we 'd split a bottle of wine and were both feeling sad and sentimental . It had been more a realization after the initial euphoria dried up that Wilhelm was not the shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the strudelbakinghausfrau whom Wilhelm hoped he 'd married . " " But did n't Ochs understand that his wife had her own career in music ? " " I do n't believe the career amounted to much at that stage . Norma was only a youngster then , still singing Oh Promise Me ' at church weddings . Naturally a voice like hers could n't be kept under wraps , though . She began getting invitations , and accepted the ones that took her farthest away from Wilhelm . He was doing well himself by then , on tour a great deal of the time and all that . Better marriages than theirs have fallen apart under that kind of strain . But it was a marriage in law and in church . Norma could n't bring herself to apply for a divorce and Wilhelm , I gather , did n't want to be bothered . So there they were , up a gum tree and stuck there . " It was an oddly childish expression for a man of Pitney 's presence to use . Madoc smiled a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Montreal , when she gets the chance . She and Jacques-Marie keep an apartment there , though since he 's been with the Wagstaffe , I doubt whether he gets to spend much time in it . He 's bought himself a small house not far from Wagstaffe . I expect she visits him but they 're pretty cozy about their relationship , as you must have gathered . " Thinking of those two black silk sleeping masks and the two pairs of fuzzy earplugs , Madoc refrained from comment except to ask , " Does Houdon have a garden at his house ? " " I expect so . He likes to think of himself as a bon bourgeois . Wait a minute , Madoc . You 're not trying to imply  --  " " I 'm not implying anything . I 'm just fishing around . What else can you tell me ? " " Not much . You must remember that I do n't really know Houdon , except professionally and not much of that . He 's a tremendous musician , one of the best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine person . Please do n't get the impression that I 'm any great confidant of hers ; it 's just that we sing together a lot and a certain camaraderie isp132bound to develop , particularly on tour in unfamiliar places . Ainsworth 's a dear chap in his way but he 's not much company , and Delicia has other interests . " Pitney 's chuckle was low and mellow . " Norma and I tend to hang together when there 's nobody else around to chum with . She 's an interesting woman , and I enjoy her company . Within the bounds of decorum , needless to say . " " Needless , indeed , " said Madoc . " I think I 'll pop up myself and get to know her better . " " I thought you were hungry . " " I am , but I do n't feel particularly tempted by anything I see here . I daresay Ranger Rick can find us some food if the situation turns desperate . That 's assuming we get a chance to let him know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press conference was going on in the lobby , he doted as he went upstairs . Sir Emlyn was looking definitely fed up . Even Delicia Fawn appeared to be losing her zest for exposure . He 'd like to find out what , if anything , was going on with Mr. Zlubert and the airplane , but first things first . Madoc was a trifle nonplussed as to which room he ought to look for Madame Bellini in . He plumped for the one in which he 'd seen her sleeping , and was right . She answered his discreet rap with alacrity , but recoiled when she saw whom she 'd got . " I 'm sorry to disturb you , Madame Bellini , " Madoc apologized , " but we have to talk . " " So ? Then come in and close the door . Is it still a zoo down there ? And is the monkey still capering ? What is all this planes buzzing around ? " " It 's still a zoo , " he affirmed . " The monkey 's getting tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , the news planes have been keeping others from landing . There is n't much space out there , and our plane is right in the middle of it . Madame , I do not come here to talk about airplanes . You are a woman of discretion , may I confide in you ? " " Is this an affair of the heart ? " " My heart is safely with my wife in Fredericton . This is an affair of the police , whom I represent , in case you had n't heard . " " Yes , you are Mad Carew . It is known . Seat yourself . Confiding is easier so . "  |p133She  herself perched on the edge of the bed and nodded toward the only chair in the room . Obediently , Madoc sat . " You must have heard by now , Madame , that Wilhelm Ochs is assumedto have been deliberately poisoned . " " And you know , is it not , that Wilhelm Ochs was my ' usband ? I am not fool , Inspector Rhys , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p134Madoc  had n't expected to have to apologize again so soon . " I beg your pardon , Madame . It was not through lack of respect , just that something else always seemed to need doing first . You and Mr. Ochs had been separated for many years , is that not so ? " " That is so . We would never have married had he been less handsome then and I more fluent in English . When I thought he was talking love to me , he was talking instead love about food . Norma Bellini could not remain forever playing second fiddle to a double cheeseburger ! If what you wish to confide is a warrant for my arrest , I tell you frankly you are wasting your time . I did not poison Wilhelm . I have not the temperamentto murder him or anybody . Besides , there was still a small fondness , as for an old friend from whom one has grown away . Also , I would have not known this ricin . Of gardens I know only that red roses grow on different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite certain . Is it not so ? " " It is at any rate logical . I have no warrant for your arrest , Madame Bellini . What I wished to confide to you is that Cedric Rintoul has last night been murdered , also . " Her fine dark eyes met his without blinking . " That is regrettable but not surprising . Why do you tell me ? " " Because I 've been given to understand that Rintoul was a longtime friend of your late husband . " " That is true . Cedric was one of the reasons I found life with Wilhelminsupportable . That first whoopee cushion he put in my chair opened my eyes , I can tell you . Wilhelm thought me insensitive and prudish not to laugh . I knew from that moment that I would have to live for my art alone . Was Cedric also poisoned with ricin ? " " No , he was stabbed late last night with an icepick. "  | " Indeed ? An unimaginative but efficient weapon , one assumes . I know little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be blown up by an exploding cigar . For Cedric always the big boom . Could this not have been suicide , in view of his having been dismissed from the orchestra in disgrace yesterday afternoon ? " Madoc shook his head . " I grant you it might be technically possible to stab oneself in the back of the neck , but it 's not a method generally favored by people committing suicide . " " And it is not something one does for the laugh , " Madame agreed . " Unless by chance Cedric thought this was a collapsing icepick ? He had once a trick dagger . He tried to stab me with it . I was not amused . " This was an angle Madoc had n't thought of . Nor did he think much of it now . " I believe we can safely reject that theory , Madame Bellini . Rintoul appears to have been about to make himself a drink . " " That is likely . He was drinking last night , one observed . And the icepick ? He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had been in the kitchen , where I found his body . I 'd noticed it earlier , an old-fashioned one with a solid wood handle and a strong steel rod , pointed at the end . " " Then a tool for serious business . You are quite right , Cedric would have not have done that to himself . Possibly to somebody else . I sensed always in those practical jokes an element of malice , of cruelty . To annoy , to frighten , to humiliate is not the act of a generous temperament , do you think ? Even the ricin Cedric could have administered , thinking perhaps not to kill but only to make Wilhelm sick on stage . But the icepick , who ? " " I was hoping you might have some ideas . Obviously you knew Rintoul well enough while you were still living with your husband . " " I knew him too well . They were big buddies . It was impossible to be with Wilhelm and not with Cedric . But not for long , you understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I jumped for joy and never went back , at least not to stay . I do not say it was Cedric alone who broke up my marriage . It was perhaps more that Cedric made me realize Wilhelm was a lout . Already in one year after the wedding Wilhelm had begun to get fat and lose his looks . I am sensitive to a good appearance in a man . " The opulent brunette could smile exactly like the Mona Lisa , Madoc noticed . " But Wilhelm was a superb French-horn player and I regretp136his loss , not at all for myself but for the world of music , you understand . I am being open with you . Even Cedric I have to regret a little although he had begun to flat his upper register and it would not have been long anyway . He had not the temperament for a good teacher or even to be staff like the fussy-budget Shadd . Perhaps it was better the icepick . Who knows ? It is for God to decide . " She crossed herself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say . It was a long time ago , you realize , and not at the Wagstaffe but in Quebec where I met Wilhelm and thus inevitably Cedric . I was a young girl out of convent school , singing in churches and taking lessons from the great and wonderful Adrienne Desjardins , to whom I owe my careerand my happiness . " " Madame Desjardins is perhaps an aunt of Monsieur Houdon ? " Madoc asked with an air of sublime innocence . That was when he learned Madame Bellini also had a dimple in her left cheek . " So ? It seems reasonable to you that a handsome and distinguishedartist like Houdon would be attracted to fat old Bellini instead of the ravishing young Fawn ? " " Any man of taste , intelligence , and high artistic standards could have little difficulty in deciding which of you is the more truly worthy of his affections . " " Bah , you are courtier ! " By George , she had dimples all over the place . " So you , too , noticed that La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagstaffe . Houdon was quite disgusted . So also your respected father . And you , no doubt . " " I found it a source of considerable discomfort , " Madoc replied with at least a modicum of truth . " You knew Monsieur Houdon before you came to Wagstaffe , then ? " " Since you have taken me into your confidence , I too confide . " MadameBellini leaned toward Madoc and lowered her voice to a throaty murmur . " Madame Desjardins is only a second cousin of JacquesMarie . " She smoothed her hands over the lap of the royal-blue dress she was wearing ; then in a flurry of dimples and blushes , she confessed . " Nonetheless , he has been for seven years my dearest friend . " " Monsieur Houdon has been greatly honored . And has he found the arrangement a comfortable one ? " " Do you mean has he wished , as I also , to regularize the situation ?  |p137Naturally  , yes . If you mean were we so desperate to do so that either of us would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . " " Did Monsieur Houdon in fact know that Wilhelm Ochs was the man to whom you were married ? " " I did not tell him that , no . He has known solely that I have a husband living from whom I have been for many years estranged . It would have made an awkwardness , you understand , had Jacques-Marie known that my husband was actually playing in the same orchestra with him . Also , Wilhelm had grown unattractively gross , and Jacques is a fastidious man . He would have been revolted to think that I could ever have  --  but you realize my situation . It was better for both of them not to know . " " But Cedric Rintoul knew . Were n't you afraid he 'd tell ? " " Why should he ? Jacques and I have been discreet , our friendship is not known . Until this week , I had not sung ever with the Wagstaffe . I have been much in other cities , sometimes in the States , sometimes in Europe . In Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who got the big ovations ! There was no reason for Cedric to speak of me to Jacques , even if it were the done thing for a trombonist to play tattletale to the concertmaster , which I assure you Jacques-Marie Houdon would not permit . In any event , Jacques is no hot-blooded young fool , to fly into a jealous rage and  --  " " So ! " The distinguished concertmaster hurled himself through the bedroom door and slammed it behind him . " Then , Madame , it was not your sense of what was owed to the dignity of your position , but the desire to hold a little tete-a-tete with a younger man which has impelled you to leave me alone with that pack of ghouls ! " He was talking in French ; rather he was hissing French words through his clenched teeth . There was only one thing to do , and Madoc did it . " Monsieur ! " His own French was fluent enough even though , for some reason , he spoke it with a strong Welsh accent . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , not to mention that of the son of your illustrious conductor and his lady , and further , of my own beloved and cherished wife who descends from a founding family of Pitcherville , New Brunswick , with ancestral acres , by blue ! And her brother , Bert , who has ascended to high position in the Loyal Order of Owls , " Madoc appended to make it a little more impressive.  | " Monsieur ! " cried Houdon . " Ah , yes , Monsieur ! A hot-blooded young fool might demand satisfactionon the field of honor , but you and I , Monsieur , are men of reason . I consider to myself the agonizing strain under which you have labored . I ask of you only a full and abject apology to the deeply wronged Madame Bellini and for myself a chance to share with you the purport of our perfectly respectable and innocent discourse . " " You have wounded me , Jacques ! " cried Madame Bellini , getting into the spirit of the occasion , " and wronged Monsieur l'Inspecteur , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allow him to explain , I entreat you . " Jacques-Marie shrugged a shrug of the first magnitude . " But naturallyif in the excess of my devotion I have acted upon a false impression , I am willing to render what atonement is required by my honor as a gentleman . Speak , then , and I will hear with profound attention . " " You are all that is generous and noble , my love , " cried Madame Bellini . " Ah , cock not that eyebrow at me ; I may now without restraint employ a term of endearment . This wise young man knows all . Let me myself reveal that which I have hitherto kept locked in my bosom , not from any reason of base deception but entirely , my dear one , to prevent an embarrassment that might even have deterred you from accepting the appointment as concertmaster of the Wagstaffe Symphony which is the crown and pinnacle of your illustrious career . It is I and no other who made the fateful decision not to tell you that my long-separated husband was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Wilhelm Ochs ? That  --  that eater ? " " Yes , that eater . I feared , I confess , that you would see me through less enchanted eyes did you but know that I had long ago allied myself with so dedicated a gourmand . But reflect yourself , my Jacques , I beg you . Wilhelm was thinner then . He was attractive . He was amiable , he was generous , he was kind in his way . And he was even when younger a totally magnificent player of the French horn . " " You have right , my pigeon . What could you then have known of men , a young girl out of the convent ? My cherished , I also have a confession . Adrienne Desjardins has told me all , I have known since coming to the Wagstaffe that your so mistakenly espoused was in truth Wilhelm Ochs . She thought it best that I know , you comprehend ? Not to make mischief , my word , but in order to avoid any contretemps . Naturally , she relied on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must once have been thinner . I could detect in his visage the remnant of good looks . In a way , I was reassured that he was not more prepossessing . With such a one as he , I comforted myself , there could have been no true union of soul and spirit . " Madame Bellini was all eagerness to agree . " Oh no , Jacques . None whatsoever . " " Ah . I found him , I have to say , at least amiable and diligent . And a musician de premier rang , after all . A decent man in spite of some thickness of the head and a penchant for vulgar jokes . It was the temperamentof the brass player , I told myself . What could one do ? Not everybody can play in the strings , or there would be no orchestra . " " Always the philosopher . I should have known I could trust to your intelligence and compassion , my chevalier . " " Your apprehension was natural , my flower of the lily . I myself felt some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagstaffe , but how , I reasoned , could the eminent Sir Emlyn Rhys have chosen anothercontralto ? It is well known that he seeks always the best , even the Fawn . That one is a bitch in heat , no doubt , but she is a voice ! Not such a voice as you , my incomparable , and with none of your serene beauty and dignity of manner , need it be said ? But still a voice . In any event , Ochs made no scene but behaved himself with what grace he might command . If he sought that which had been , I saw no sign . " " I assure you , my amorous , he did not . Wilhelm was amiable in his greeting to me . He expressed pleasure that I had gained a little weight ; a compliment I did not much appreciate , you understand . He invited me to lunch on the first day , I confess , but I explained that I had experiencedenough of watching him eat during our days of cohabitation . He found this a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teashop and he to a Burger King . You surely find no fault in this ? " " There is none to be found . My own , let us forgive each other . And this young inspector of police will forgive us both , eh ? " He cast a hopefulglance at the bed on which Madame Bellini was still sitting . She blushed , but demurred . " But he has not yet told what you gave him permission to say . Speak , Monsieur 1'Inspecteur . Of his great perspicacity , Jacques-Marie Houdon will no doubt be able to cast light on this vile deed . " So Madoc at last got to explain . The concertmaster was interestedp140though not unduly agitated by the news that a second member of the brass section had been done away with . " One sees it was inevitable . Rintoul was naturally from the beginning the intended victim . Ochs , poor fellow , had without a doubt eaten the poison intended for him . " Madoc turned to Norma Bellini . " Would your husband have done that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes , all the time . It was his favorite prank , to dart his fork across the table into some interesting tidbit on another 's plate and gobble it down , laughing all the while . With his mouth open , alas . Jacques is right , without doubt . I know something of these things , I read sometimes to improve my English the Miss Marple and the Peter Shandy , you know ? It has been said that murderers employ always the same methods ; but I have not found this so in the books . " " That is perhaps only because the authors wish to display their ingenuity , my innocent , " Houdon murmured . " Bah , it is mere practicality . Figure yourself , Jacques . It is clear to me that , the too-cunning technique of the ground-up bean of the castor plant having proved unreliable , the murderer would then attempt what you call the hands-on method of the stabbed-in icepick . Is that not correct , my cabbage ? " " My beautiful , I have to agree with Monsieur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a respectable orchestra to be killing each other , even though I ask myself why with Rintoul , it has not happened sooner . There have been times , I admit freely , when I have felt the urge . Always I had to remind myself that here was a trombonist of the first rank who , whatever his enormities , did not ever try to imitate the swing band and put in hot licks while playing the trombone solo in the Tuba Mirum movement of the Mozart Requiem , which happened once in the States while I myself was conducting . " " My God ! They are all barbarians down there , of course . Still it is incredible , the audacity , " Madame Bellini remarked . " And here is more audacity in the stabbing of Rintoul , " Houdon continued . " It is therefore for us a duty to assist in bringing the malefactorto justice . Even "  --  he sighed and glanced once more at the bed  --  " when we might naturally prefer to be doing something else . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested diffidently , " we might start by making sure you yourselves are eliminated from suspicion . " Madame Bellini nodded . " That is correct Sherlock Holmes procedure . One sees first that we could not have poisoned Wilhelm because , my faith , we would not have eaten with Wilhelm . " " And we could not have stabbed Rintoul , " added Houdon , " because I tell you in confidence we spent all last night exchanging with one another that solace which a man and a woman can find to give in even the darkest of circumstances , you comprehend ? " " Fully , " sighed Madoc . " Then what about the rest of the company ? Have you any thoughts or opinions you 'd like to share ? " " Opinions , yes , " said Norma Bellini . " I myself am confident this murderer is none of the singers . Carlos , Ainsworth , and I have sung together many times under the direction of your excellent father , which is a privilege to be coveted . I know them well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the life of one he held dear were threatened , but never by stealth , always from the front . For Wilhelm or Cedric , he had no occasion . He had not known them before , he did not wish to know them in Wagstaffe . He is not a snob , Carlos ; it is simply that singers and instrumentalists on tour do not mix . " " Yes , that 's been mentioned , " Madoc conceded . " And the tenor , Kight ? " " Ainsworth ? " She shrugged . " Ainsworth is conscious of himself and of the audience . As there is only one Ainsworth Kight , so everyone else counts as audience except his accompanist for whom he has a fondness , you understand , but did not bring on this tour . He accepts also his fellow singers because , after all , not even the great Kight can sing Judas Maccabaeus all by himself . Ainsworth is a good-natured fellow , mindp142you . He is not unfriendly . But he regards nobody in this world of sufficientimportance for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what about Delicia Fawn ? " " What can I say ? Except that she is more likely to become a victim than a murderess , and also to lose early both her looks and her voice if she keeps up these pretty tricks . It is all a nonsense with her , you know , but a dangerous nonsense . In effect , however , I can not see Cedric Rintoul being mistaken for Delicia Fawn no matter how dark the night . " " Norma has a point there , " said Houdon . " I believe , Monsieur 1'Inspecteur , you must look among those orchestra members now with us . It was a mistake not to wait and kill Rintoul after we would be all back together at the festival ; since now the field has narrowed , has it not ? So we eliminate . Me , we have for the moment laid aside . Though I do not delude myself that you accept only my word , I appeal to you as a man of reason . Would I have chosen to poison Ochs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my own garden a goodly number of castor oil plants ? " " You do ? " This was the most promising news Madoc had heard yet . " But of course . I have little time for gardening , so I attempt a rich display with the least of effort . The flowers of the castor oil plant are nothing to covet , but the foliage is beyond description . One leaf may be ten inches across , I tell you , shaped somewhat like a giant maple leaf but creased into the most beguiling pleats like a lady 's fan . The texture is interesting and the colors most deliciously subtle greens and bronzy shades . " " Oh , " said Madoc , " are those the plants they used to have growing in Assiniboine Park when I was a kid in Winnipeg ? " Houdon nodded . " I too have observed them there , ten feet tall and of a luxuriance , my word ! But those were fed on wild buffalo manure , which in Wagstaffe is not easy to find . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe this must be only from contented cows as my plants never grow higher than five or six feet . " " The bovine temperament would count , no doubt . Tell me , who inthe orchestra might know you have castor oil plants in your garden ? " " Jason Jasper , for a certainty . He lives not far from me and is also agardener , though mostly vegetables since he has a large family . Headmires my plants and once intimated he would like some seeds . I hadp143to point out that they are poisonous and therefore not a thing to plant around children . " " When was this ? Does he visit often ? " " Not in the sense of a visit , no . One takes the evening stroll . If the neighbor is out in his garden , one might stop for a moment to exchange a word . He is knowledgeable , that Jasper , and not offensive when in his own milieu . With his children , he has the consideration not to stop . With his wife , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Recently ? " " The last one , yes , only three weeks ago . It was for Norma , to meet with the orchestra and staff before the tour . This was quite proper for me to do and gave me great satisfaction . Ochs and Rintoul both happened to be playing elsewhere with a brass ensemble that day , " he added with a tight little smile . " Anyway , there was much admiration of my magnificent plants and I had to caution again to avoid the beans . They are large , you know , and not unattractive . I had attempted to pick off and destroy the most accessible , but there were no doubt many left . I had so little time to prepare . " " You had even less time for me . " Now that her cover was blown , Madame Bellini could be quite the coquette . " But this was a charming affair and enjoyed by all . Jacques is a superb host , you can imagine . " " I 'm sure he is . Other than Ochs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think so , yes , " replied the concertmaster . " It has been my habit since becoming again a householder to give on occasion these parties when time and scheduling permit . I hire an excellent caterer and nobodyis asked to perform . I get few refusals . This is not helpful ? " " Not very , I have to say . On the strength of this , it looks as if anybody in the orchestra could have got hold of the castor beans . One more question ; what can you tell me about David Gabriel , outside of the fact that he 's the Wagstaffe 's first chair oboist ? " " But aside from that , what is there to tell ? Gabriel plays his oboe , makes reeds for his oboe , maybe on occasion he goes to bed with his oboe , who knows ? Ask Ragovsky , he knows everybody . Better still , ask Gabriel . " The interview was clearly over . Madoc exchanged a few more courtesiesand went downstairs . The press conference also appeared to be winding down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some to the kitchen where Joe Ragovsky was going to make more biscuits , some out to the flat to watch the planes go off and no doubt pester the pilots for any news about a possible rescue . Only two stayed where they were . David Gabriel was in the chair by the window where he 'd been sitting last night , winding wire around another reed . Sir Emlyn remained seated where he 'd been most of the morning , lookingas gray around the muzzle as an aged beagle . Madoc went over to him . " Hi , Tad . Let 's hope that 's the last of them for a while . Where 's Mum ? " " She 's gone upstairs to take an aspirin and lie down . I do n't blame her . Madoc , how long is this to go on ? " " I was hoping you could tell me . Has n't Rick come back ? What did Zlubert have to say ? " " To me , nothing whatever . As I understand it , Zlubert talked with MacVittie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . I have n't had a chance to get to them myself , I 've been too busy answering the same asinine questions over and over till I 'm ready to go back to Wales and spend the rest of my life herding Uncle Caradoc 's sheep . Sheep can be tiresome , too , but at least they do n't take photographs . Rick has not come back and I ca n't blame him . Madoc , I am anxious , very anxious . What are we going to do about  --  ? " " The best we can , Tad . I 've been working on it , but I need Rick . It 's a rotten shame Zlubert took off so fast , I would n't dare ask any of these media blokes to take me down to the ranger station . You can imagine what that would lead to . Maybe Mr. Gabriel here can help us . " Gabriel did n't even look up from his reed . Sir Emlyn hiked himself out of the uncomfortable wooden chair , stiff from too much sitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and did the talking . " Gabriel ? " " Eh ? Oh , yes . Sorry . " He was even younger than Madoc had thought ; he must have been some kind of child prodigy . He laid his unfinished reed carefully on the windowsill and stood up . " Good morning . Or is it afternoon ? " " Who knows ? I 'd like to ask you a couple of questions , if you do n't mind . It 's about Cedric Rintoul. "  | " Cedric ? I do n't think I 've seen him this morning . Has he been around ? " " No , but he was here last night . When I went upstairs , you and he were the last ones left in the lobby . " " Were we ? I thought Joe Ragovsky was still there . Joe fixed the fire , I remember that . " " The fire had already been banked when I got back from the ranger station . " " The ranger station ? Was that where you went ? In that crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? You got back in one piece , eh . Good flight ? " " Gabriel , could we cut the small talk ? " " Whatever you like . I 'm no good at it , anyway " The oboist was on the gangly side , with mouse-fine light brown hair that could have stood a trimming , and baby-blue eyes that blinked a lot . No doubt he had a doting wife , mother , or sweetheart who waited on him hand and foot back in Wagstaffe ; he did n't look like the sort who 'd be much good at fending for himself . Right now he was casting a worriedglance at his reed . " Was there something else you wanted to talk about ? Because I 've got this reed  --  " " Gabriel , you 've been making reeds the whole time you 've been here . " " I know , but I have this impossible dream that one day I 'll make an absolutely perfect reed . It 's rather like the quest for the Holy Grail . Not quite on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably not , Gabriel , but no doubt a worthy aspiration . Getting back to Rintoul , could you tell me what time you left him ? " " I do n't think I left him , exactly . That is to say , if you leave somebody , it 's more as if one of you were going away somewhere . All I did was go upstairs to bed , which does n't quite count because he was going to be doing the same thing . Theoretically , anyway . " " Rintoul was , however , still in the lobby when you went to bed ? " " I assume so , if he was here before . " " But you do n't know ? Were n't you talking with him ? " " Not that I recall . Maybe Cedric was talking to me , and I just was n't hearing him . " David Gabriel was blushing now , a flaming crimson with flashes of scarlet . " You see  --  well , maybe Sir Emlyn is n't going to likep146this much , but  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you know those Handel sonatas for two oboes and continuo ? " The elder Rhys nodded . " The six pieces Lord Polwarth discovered in Germany , which Handel is supposed to have composed as a child of ten ? Yes , they are charming . Not the sort of thing I ever get to use myself , of course . " " I realize that , and I know I ought to have been thinking about the pieces we 're going to be playing at Fraser River , but you see "  --  he really was the most spectacular blusher Madoc had ever run across  --  " I have this pupil . " " A young woman pupil of seemly countenance and agreeable disposition , by any chance ? " For some reason Sir Emlyn was smiling . " Is it possible you were meditating on the third movement of the Number Two in D-minor ? " " Well , " the young musician actually giggled , " as a matter of fact , yes . " " I can think of nothing more appropriate . You might also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , you may recall , the Affetuoso is followed by the Vivace , which you may find even more effective in terms of the learning experience than the Allegro . " Madoc had only a glimmer as to what his father was talking about , but Gabriel had by now faded to a nice , rosy pink and was grinning from ear to ear . " Thank you very much , Sir Emlyn . " " Any time , my boy . And now if you could possibly turn your mind back to last night , I 'm sure my son would be grateful for any recollectionyou might be able to dredge up about Rintoul . Perhaps it would help if you were to sit down again and get back to work on your reed ? Re-create the scene , as it were . " With the reed back in his hands and his dilemma about the Handel sonatas resolved , David Gabriel was finally at ease . " Let 's see . I was sitting here and Cedric was over there . You know , he did say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting damned cold in here . ' I think he must have been talking to me , because nobody else said anything . They must all have gone to bed , as you say . Then it occurred to me that my hands were so numb I could hardly manage my fingers , so I put my reed and my wire cutters inside the cover of my instrument case and picked it up and went to bed . " " You did n't say good night to Rintoul ? "  | " I may have nodded or something , I 'm not sure . I do n't like Cedric much . " " But he was in fact still sitting here when you left the lobby ? " " Unless he got up after my back was turned . I 'm quite sure he did n't come upstairs right behind me . I 'm always pretty wary of letting Cedric get too close . He 's too apt to do some stupid thing like pinning a sign on your back or sticking a burr in your hip pocket so you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs after I got into my room , come to think of it , but I do n't think it was Cedric . Unless he was trying awfully hard to be quiet , which is n't like him . " " It did n't occur to you to look out and see who was there ? " Madoc asked . " No , why should it ? " " Simply that you might have helped us to answer the question of who killed him . " At last Madoc had found a way to get David Gabriel 's complete and undivided attention . " Oh , sweet dying Jesus ! " the oboist all but shouted . " What the bloody hell 's going on here , will you answer me that ? " " I hope I can , soon . " " And what happens if you ca n't ? " " Then I 'm afraid we may find ourselves stuck here till I can . Mr. Gabriel , did you attend that garden party at Monsieur Houdon 's ? " " Yes , I did . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants he has in his yard ? " " With leaves like great , big fans ? Yes , I  --  well , I 'm not much good at standing around making conversation with people . I found them handy to hide behind some of the time , if you really want to know . " " That 's exactly what I want to know . Did you by any chance happen to notice anyone picking beans off the plants ? " " As a matter of fact , I did . I was n't thinking much about the beans at the time , I have to say . I was mostly hoping he would n't come over and start talking to me . " " He who ? " " Cedric Rintoul , naturally . But then Frieda Loye came along and told him he 'd better leave those beans alone because Houdon had been warning everybody that they were deadly poison . So Cedric said , Thenp148what have you been stuffing them up your nose for ? ' He reached over and pretended to be pulling them out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . It honestly looked as if he was getting them out of her nose . " " And how did Frieda Loye take that ? " " Not too well , I 'm afraid . She went right up in smoke . " " What did she say ? " " She said  --  " Gabriel swallowed and blushed . " She said , Honest to God , Cedric , one of these days I 'm going to kill you ! ' "  | " Did she , indeed ? " asked Madoc . " And what did Rintoul say to that ? " " It was rather strange . He said , Cool it , Frieda . You 're not going to get hold of it that easily . ' " " What do you suppose he meant by get hold of it ' ? " " Well , Cedric had such a filthy mind that I thought maybe he was telling Frieda he would n't  --  you know  --  have it off with her . Though I ca n't imagine why she 'd have wanted him to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a guess . He probably did n't mean anything at all . " " And what did he do with the beans he 'd picked ? " " Tossed them back among the bushes . " " All of them ? " " How could I tell ? He might have palmed a few , I told you he was good at sleight-of-hand . Inspector , you 're not thinking Cedric used those beans to poison Wilhelm Ochs ? " " It 's fairly apparent that somebody did . " " But Cedric and Wilhelm were pals . They always hung around to-gether . " " He could have given them to somebody else . " " Why would he do that ? " " I have no idea . We simply have to bear in mind all the possibilities . " " I suppose so . Oh look , there 's a car pulling up out front ! " " It 's the ranger wagon , Madoc , " Sir Emlyn exclaimed , quite unnecessarilysince his son was already heading for the door , feeling somesixteen pounds lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wagon , opening the tailgate to get at a large kettle . Ed Naxton was running over to help him . So were a number of other people . Madoc got there first.  | " Ellen sent you a present . " Disdaining any help , Rick was going to carry the kettle himself . " Your kitchen stove going ? " " It was the last time I looked , " Madoc replied . " What have you got there ? " " Spaghetti , best she could do at such short notice . We knew from what you told us last night that the rations were getting pretty slim up here . When the message came through from Wagstaffe , Ellen got on the radio and told me I 'd better get back and let her fix something for you all to eat . That was when I was up here earlier with the plane . Maybe you noticed me turn back . It did n't look as if I was going to get down any time soon , so rather than waste my gas circling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit buzzing over . You folks have had a busy morning . " " You might say that , " Madoc agreed . " But what 's happening , Rick ? Are there any plans to get us out of here ? " " Yes , we 're going to start ferrying you folks down in the wagon to the ranger station as soon as we get the word . A charter plane 's coming to collect you from there and fly you on to Vancouver . They did n't want to risk landing on Lodestone Flat with the Grumman in the way . But it 's going to take a while yet before they get everything organized , and we figured there was no reason why you had to go hungry in the meantime . Ellen said to tell you she 's sorry she did n't have a dessert to send , but she 'll have something baked by the time you get to the house . I put this kettle inside a box of straw to keep it hot on the way up , but you might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a stir now and then , Ellen says , so it wo n't catch on the bottom . " " Do n't worry , this spaghetti is n't going to scorch . It wo n't last long enough , " Joe Ragovsky assured the ranger . " Boy does this smell good ! How about rustling up some plates , somebody ? We 'll stick ' em in the oven to take the chill off . " All was joy and bustle , everybody getting in everybody else 's way and nobody giving a rap . Lady Rhys came downstairs , marvelously revived by the odor of home cooking and the prospect of getting away . Sir Emlyn kissed her right in front of the entire assemblage . It was no mere peck on the cheek , either . Only Lucy Shadd was oddly subdued . She made no move to run the show as usual . While the others milled around making themselves morep151or less useful as the case might be , Lucy stayed out in the lobby , sitting next to the stove , holding the scarf high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby anyway , it seemed silly to try to cram them back into the kitchen . The sensible thing , it was agreed by mass osmosis , would be for each person to fill a plate for himself from the spaghetti kettle and Joe 's new batch of biscuits and carry his lunch into the lobby . Luckily , Ellen Rick was the kind of cook who breaks spaghetti into short pieces instead of leaving it in strings , probably because she was used to feeding small children and Ace Bulligan , so they would n't have much trouble managing the food buffet-style . Steve MacVittie remembered that there were still two bottles of red wine in the plane , not much for a party of this size but enough for everyone to have a few sips in celebration of their impending rescue . Ranger Rick had already eaten , he told them ; he would n't share the festive repast but acted as waiter and busboy instead . It was he who brought Lucy Shadd the spaghetti and wine she had n't been able to raise gumption enough to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did n't say anything until he himself had managed to put away the double helping he felt he deserved and knew he needed . Then he asked her , " What 's the matter , Lucy ? Is your neck still bothering you ? " Lady Rhys and Frieda Loye were both clearly surprised that Madoc should bring up the topic which those in the know had been avoiding . So was Lucy , but she answered readily enough . " Yes , it 's rather painful . I expect I did too much yesterday . " " What did you do to your neck , Lucy ? " Joe Ragovsky asked . Madoc answered for her . " Somebody wrapped a violin string around it yesterday morning . That 's what all the screaming was about . " " My God ! " shouted Joe , " you mean he was trying to strangle her ? " Everybody started yelling at once , but Sir Emlyn made a small gesturewith his finger to his lips , and the mouths all snapped shut together . There was much to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conductor as a father . " That appears to have been the intention , " he went on quietly . " And this morning , I must tell you , we 've had a further complication . When I came down to open up the fires , I found Cedric Rintoul on the kitchen floor , stabbed to death with an icepick . " This was almost too much for them to take in . Nobody was **31;16585;TOOLONG departure had apparently been a signal to the Fludds that they should come forward , however unpleasant a duty such an overture should be . Arm in arm they descended the several stone steps of the porch and began to move toward Joan and Matthew . Behind them came a clutch of female servants . " We are the Fludds , Cuth and Moll , " announced the female member with a kind of defiance when they were still a good twenty feet from Joan . " Cuth , " remarked the man of the family redundantly . The old man made a jerky little motion with his head , something between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a gesture of greeting . But the movement  --  and perhaps its significance  --  wasdetected by Moll , who gave her husband an interdictorypoke in the ribs for his indiscretion . Joan took in this little drama and formed an instant dislike for the old housekeeper . She did not approve of prideful servants , nor did she care for domineering wives . Moll Fludd was clearly both . " We are Joan and Matthew Stock , " Matthew announced with a tone of voice he used when he was determined to be pleasant under conditions to the contrary . " Come from London at the command of Mistress Frances Challoner to serve as  --  " " All that we know , " Moll interrupted . " As our replacements . In our dotage . Very well , Matthew Stock and wife . We have ever done as we were told and we will do it still . We are not twain who must be driven to pasture like dumb beasts . " With great ceremony , the old woman drew a collection of keys she wore at her waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a like badge of authority , proffered his to Matthew . Cuth said , " There are also ledgers , kept with great care by me . " The old man 's voice broke with emotion , tears glistened in his eyes . " These you shall find in very good order in the steward 's office , giving the particulars of all the servants and providing other such matters that  --  " " I warrant the new steward knows what he shall find and what not , Cuth , " said Moll , cutting her husband off in midsentence and looking sternly at Matthew as though he were to blame for any rudeness she had offered . " I trust all will be in good order , " Matthew said . Moll now turned her attention to the four female servants inp51her charge . She counted their number twice over and then said , " What , where 's the pretty one  --  Aileen what's-her-name ? " Her companions professed not to know and Moll was highly displeased . " Foolish girl  --  I 'll whip her smartly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gawking . The rest of you take these folks ' baggage to their quarters at once . You know where it is . " Then she turned to Joan again and said , " It 's nigh unto one o'clock . You will probably want dinner . The cook is a woman  --  Irish , like all of the female servants saving myself , who am true English born . She speaks very little English , and the rest are hardly richer in learning . Her name is Una , and as for her skill in cookery , well , what can be said of one born in so savage a land ? " These disparaging comments were evidently ignored by the other servants , who obediently distributed the burden of the various chests and bags in proportion to their respective strengths and went filing into the house . " We are n't used to fine food , " remarked Joan , largely because the departure of the other servants had created an awkward silence and also out of sympathy for the defamed Una , who Joan was sure was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not used to fine food ? " asked Moll with a sudden and clearly pretended expression of amazement . " Why , I would have thought your long sojourn in the great houses of the high and mighty of London would have made standard servants ' fare as great an abomination to your tongues as swine 's flesh to a Jew . " " As my wife has said , we are not used to dainty cates , nor do we require them , " Matthew answered severely . " Where we have served , we have always conducted ourselves as servants , not as masters . We have shared with our fellows and gladly . " " Oh , was it so , " returned Moll with contempt . " Well , I suppose that is to your credit . Follow me , then , if you will . First , you shall both feed to your content , then see your chamber , which I pray you find to your liking . Tomorrow , or the next day , is soon enough , I trust , for a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be soon enough , " Matthew said . Moll faced about and started off toward the porch , leaving her husband and Joan and Matthew to follow . The door led directly to the kitchen , a large , airy room with smoke-blackened ceiling andp52aromatic with herbs , a recent stew , and burning wood . Against one wall was the hearth , a dark cavity of generous dimensions in which sat three sturdy-looking kettles and a huge caldron . On both sides of the hearth hung pans and other implements  --  knives , ladles , tongs , pincers , spoons , and spatulas . In the middle of the room was a long trencher table and benches . " A very ample kitchen , is it not ? " Moll asked Joan when they had all come indoors . " In the old days the Challoners feasted monks and others of their ilk here . Grand meals , they were , if local legend can be believed . They gluttonized very well , those folks  --  gluttonizedwhile our local sheepherders and farmers starved for want of a tithe of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You are n't Papists , are you ? " Joan answered negatively , and this seemed to please Moll . During this conversation a buxom , dark-haired woman of about Joan 's age came into the kitchen carrying a bowlful of apples . She saw Joan and Matthew and stopped . Then she looked at Moll . " This is Una , our cook , " Moll remarked by way of her earlier assessment of the woman 's cooking . She said to Una , " These are the new steward and housekeeper . You are to follow Mistress Stock 's orders as diligently as you followed mine . " Una nodded at Joan and then at Matthew . She continued with her work . Moll looked after her and shook her head . " These Irish , " she said under her breath . " Well then , there 's bread and some cheese and a little mutton from yesternight 's supper , " Moll continued casually , glancing around the kitchen . " You may eat where and when you like . I would n't trouble Una @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her master 's whim to have her cook . I suppose the wishes of the dead must be honored . God knows , there 's no one else . " " Some cheese will do very well , " Matthew said . " And perhaps something to drink ? " Joan added . " The larder and pantry are through there , " said Moll , indicating with a nod the narrow passage through which Una had recentlycome . " While you feed , I 'll see that those idiot servants have found the right chamber and that it has been properly prepared . I 'll return shortly . Wait here until I do . The castle has many rooms . It would be a shame were you to become lost on your first day . "  |p53When  Moll left , Joan and Matthew sat down at the table . Una came presently with cups and plates and a half-loaf of brown bread and a slab of cold beef smeared with rich mustard . The woman smiled pleasantly but said nothing , and to Joan it seemed she was relieved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Joan was very hungry , they both ate what was before them . While they ate , Joan studied the cook , who was busy at a little worktable by the window chopping up the apples with a meat cleaver she wielded with considerable skill . Indeed , she chopped the apples so neatly and quickly , Joan was half afraid she would slice a finger or two in the process . As she worked , the Irishwoman hummed to herself . Although her hair was dark and graying a little around the forehead , her eyes were a deep blue and her complexion freckled like that of many of her countrywomen . Lines around her eyes and across her brow betrayed her age , as did the thickening at her waist and buttocks . Joan guessed the woman was about forty . But Una had a strong , determined chin and a shapely nose . The bones of her cheek were pronounced and her lips had a sensuous fullness that Joan was sure must have made her attractive to men in her younger years . " A cold welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Una and looked at her husband . " Very cold , " she said . " Hardly surprising , " he said , keeping his voice low . " We are intruders . We knew there 'd be no cheering upon our arrival . " " Yet I thought not to find the former housekeeper so resolute an enemy . " The cook , Una , seems friendly , " said Matthew . " She has no love for Moll , that 's for sure , " Joan observed . " Nor Moll for her . A very friendly house this . It 's a wonderthey do n't all kill each other in their sleep . I could never abide sucha wrangling of serpent tongues under my roof , " said Matthew . " Nor I , " she answered . They finished their meal and then sat talking for a while in low voices about their journey and their first impressions of Thorncombe . They agreed that if it had not been for their promise to the Queen , they would have cheerfully set out for Chelmsford on foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That woman is taking her good time seeing to our chamber , "  |p54Matthew  said after a while when the former housekeeper had not returned . " She is truly , " answered Joan . " Perhaps she 's forgotten about us . Let 's look around . " " She told us to remain here , " said Matthew . " We shall be very naughty then , " remarked Joan dryly , " and disobey her ladyship 's orders . What , are we not now steward and housekeeper of Thorncombe ? That woman is insufferable , and we shall presently have to remind her of her place and our authority . " Joan led the way from the kitchen down the corridor to another door which , when opened , revealed a chamber of such vast size that Joan surmised at once it was the great hall of the old castle . The hall was very dusty and unfurnished , like the inside of an empty barn . The floors and walls were stone ; the high ceiling a crisscross of sturdy beams , rough-hewn and blackened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge hearth and dais . High on each flanking wall were banks of clerestory windows , and at the end opposite the dais was an arched passage leading to a chapel . The chapel apparently was no longer used for religious purposes . The crucifix that had hung upon the wall and whose traces yet could be seen had been removed ; and a faintly discernible mural of some pious theme had been desecrated  --  as the rotten rags of popery  --  by the charcoal of torches . Matthew and Joan were examining the chapel when they heard Moll come up behind them . " I thought I told you to stay in the kitchen , " Moll said crankily . Joan faced the woman and said , " So you told us . We chose not to be kept waiting longer . Our new duties give us rights of passage in this house . And so we left the kitchen and proceeded to this place and find it in very poor condition indeed . " Moll glared at Joan . " It 's the banqueting hall , a scurvy place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it should be otherwise . Sir John lived in the new house . He never ventured here . He did n't like the old castle . " " I heard him say as much . I hate the old castle , ' said he , many times . " This was the voice of Moll 's husband , who had come up behind her and was now peering with unveiled hostility at the Stocks over his wife 's shoulder.  | " It 's still a disgrace , " Joan replied undauntedly . " And it must be cleaned and repaired . " " Surely you would not have these Papist images restored ? " the old woman asked , aghast . " Of course not , " Joan said . " The place is no long a sanctuary . It 's a gentlewoman 's home , and part of it should not resemble a barn in its filth . Why , look you , is that not a nest of bats there in the rafters ? " Joan pointed upward to the high ceiling where indeed there was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed them before , " Moll said defensively . Joan persisted in her attack . " And this chapel ! Look at those walls ! The images thereon shall not be restored , but must the walls look as though they bore witness still to some drunken riot of Puritan fanatics  --  drunken with zeal ? " " Drunken with zeal  --  ? " " Yes , drunken , " Joan went on , sensing now that she had the old woman in full retreat . " Order the Irish girls in with soap and pails and clean this disgraceful mess . It smells like a stable in here too ! " For a moment Moll seemed too thunderstruck to speak , then , assuming a new dignity , she went on , " I have no authority to order anyone . You have been given the keys to the house . And you may do with them as pleases you  --  and with the servants as well . As for my husband and I , our duties are now few but plain . We are in retirement . Honorable retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us room and board in the groundskeeper 's lodge . In token of our long and satisfactory service , I rnight add , for not once in forty-seven years did the masters of Thorncombe complain of my supervision . And I assure you that neither Sir John nor his father nor his father before him ever ordered me to keep the banqueting hall in such fine condition as you order . For all of me , this hideous old relic could burn to the ground tomorrow and I should gladly warm my feet by the fire . Now my husband and I will go our way . Since you found your ways hither without a guide , I suppose you may have equal success finding your chamber . " With these good wishes , Moll turned , indicated with a nod to her husband that he should follow her , and the two of them marched off toward the kitchen.  | " Detestable , unruly woman , " Joan remarked in a heat when they were alone again . " A disgrace to her sex ! " exclaimed Matthew . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fludds had looked very droll in their attitudes of high dudgeon . " But how shall we find this chamber to which our chests have been hauled ? " Joan asked when their laughter had subsided . " It 's not that large of a house , surely , " Matthew replied , looking about him with confidence . They left the chapel and hall the way they had come and found Una in the kitchen . Joan asked her where her and Matthew 's chamber could be found , and it was only the woman 's puzzled expression as response that recalled for Joan Moll 's comment about the inability of the female servants to speak English , at least very well . She next tried communicating by gestures and had some success . Una smiled pleasantly , said something in Irish , and then beckoned Joan and Matthew to follow . She led the way back through the banqueting hall and then up one of two winding staircases . They climbed what seemed a great distance until they arrived at a landing off which were several doors . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded her head several times vigorously as one completely incapable of speech might have done , and then , making the sign of the cross over her aproned bosom , she hurried downstairs . Matthew opened the door . It was with some relief that Joan saw first her chest and then Matthew 's placed next to a large bed . But the chamber itself , once Joan had entered and taken it in , had a distinctly unwelcoming appearance . The room was clean but no fire had been laid in the hearth , and the broken panes in one of the several windows let in a stream of cold air . The inhospitable effect was aggravated by Joan 's weariness and a throbbing headache . Matthew walked over and sat down on the bed . He bounced on it a few times and pronounced it adequate . Joan inspected the bed linen . It was clean . But she could tell by her husband 's expression that their chamber was as unappealing to him as it was to her . " Well , " he said with a sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Indeed , " Joan said . " Large it is , but I would have been glad for something less austere . Why , look , I 'll wager Moll 's quarters in the groundskeeper 's lodge are more comfortable . Would n't you have thought that terrible woman would have directed a fire to have been laid and some rushes upon the floor ? How I hate to tread of a cold morning on stone . " " You unpack , " Matthew suggested . " I 'll go below to find someone to fetch wood for a fire . And there 's also the matter of supper . " Supper ! " Joan exclaimed , not hungry at all . " After the day 's travel I 'm ready for bed , and you talk about eating again ! " Matthew laughed and said he would return soon . She urged him to be true to his word . She did n't want to go looking for him , much less to stay there by herself . Soon she could no longer hear the echoing of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and her headache became more clamorous . She looked at her traveling chest and considered unpacking . But she could not bring herself to begin . She sat on the bed . Homesickness for Chelmsford , her own chamber , her daughter and her little grandson conspired with her growing melancholy . Why had she consented to come ? Could the Queen not have found others to see to this matter ? She tried to shake off her melancholy by humming a merry tune , but unlike Matthew , she had no pleasing voice and her effort only made things worse . The impression the vast chamber made on her mind was too strong . A chamber designed to repel invaders , or to keep a traitor close prisoner . A fine night 's sleep she would have in such quarters . And what dreams should be inspired by the cold stone she dreaded to think . Surely their assignment to the tower had been deliberate on Moll 's part , perniciously conceived . The old woman 's remark about the burning castle , about roasting her feet by its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a palpable effort to intimidate them  --  worse than cold welcome or no welcome at all . Which , despite the physical discomfort of the moment , brought Joan 's mind around to another point . Just why had Moll done it ? Was the old woman merely jealous of her replacement ? Or was her hostility rooted in suspicion that the Stocks had come top58Thorncombe to uncover something that Moll and her husband were at pains to keep concealed ? Murder , for example . She sought relief from her aching head by lying on the bed for a while . She had no idea when Matthew would return , and she thought a nap might put all in order again . She must have slept an hour at least , for when she awoke the chamber was growing dark and as yet Matthew had not returned . Alarmed , she got up and walked toward the windows , feeling a flush of unhealth along her throat and an insidious ache in her joints too pervasive to be only the consequence of the long , torturous cart ride . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance the purple shapes of hills like a reclining figure , raw against the fading light . It struck upon her brain that what she saw there across the lake was a woman disrobed and turned upon her side with her head resting on her arm . She saw the roll of hip , the sloping flanks , the smooth contours of knee and calf , and the image fixed in her imagination and gave her some momentary relief from her anxiety . Then she dropped her eyes and saw in the middle distance the expanse of water , still and dark . She felt a sudden chill and wondered if it was another symptom . Or was it a premonition ? Matthew . In God 's name , where was he ? She was about to go in search of him when her attention was drawn to a large wardrobe standing in one corner of the chamber . Curious , she walked over and opened it . It was empty except for a long , tattered garment hanging in one corner like a dead man on a gibbet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the shadowy recess , and her heart leapt into her throat . Something , someone lurked there , motionless and silent . Without thinking of the danger to herself , she yanked open the door to admit more light and saw the thing was a slight female form sitting against the wall with her thin white-stockinged legs pulled up protectively to her chest . Clutched to the bosom like a suckling child was a dead cat . And where the girl 's head should have been  --  oh dreadful to see  --  was a mass of bloody pulp.  |p59Joan  pressed both hands over her mouth to stifle the scream welling up within her . As though empowered by a will not her own , she staggered back toward the open window , turned , and took great gulps of the cold air while endeavoring to contain her nausea . Through eyes misty with shock she looked at the purple hills that moments earlier had resembled a reclining woman . Now the hills were a dark mass , draped in funeral dusk like a corpse upon a catafalque . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It seemed a hundred years . But never had his familiar footfalls or call  --  heard now over the pounding of her heart , the clamor of her headache  --  been so welcome . She had not moved from the window since her awful discovery . She wanted Matthew both to console her and to deny what she had seen in the wardrobe . Had it been a palpable horror , or the figment of a disordered mind ? Matthew entered , followed by the young hostler , his arms loaded with faggots . Matthew began to explain his delay in returning when he noticed Joan 's face . He asked her what was wrong . She could not bring herself to speak but pointed toward the wardrobe , the door of which had remained ajar . " God in heaven , " Matthew gasped when he had seen for him/self , and in his anguished countenance resolved Joan 's doubts that what she had seen was real . Peering over Matthew 's shoulder , Edward let his burden drop , and in a dry , wheezing voice declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one not present at muster , Joan thought . The one Moll had called Aileen and threatened to beat for her insolence . Matthew ordered Edward to go fetch the Fludds and to say nothing to them or any other person about the gruesome discovery . He pushed the wardrobe door shut and went over to where Joan stood . Putting his arm around her shoulders and drawing her to him , he said , " Sir John 's drowning may have been murder or misadventure , but this poor creature 's death could only have been murder . What possessed devil would so mutilate a mere child as this girl obviously was , or prop her up with a dead cat as though she were giving it suck ? " Joan had no answer for her husband 's question . With the wardrobe shut and Matthew holding her , the ghastly vision now seemed less real , as though it had been a dream . The question lingering in her mind was unspeakable : Where was the rest of the hapless girl  --  the poor severed head ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , waiting for her , Joan , to discoverit at some awful moment to come ? Then she heard voices outside the chamber and presently Edward reappeared with a brace of candles in hand and the Fludds at his heels . Moll was complaining about the sudden , unexplained summons , the steep steps that were a torment to her bones , Edward 's sweating pallor and perverse refusal to say just what was wanted and why such urgency . Was it not nigh time decent folks were abed ? Matthew asked Moll and her husband to look into the wardrobe . " Wherefore ? " snapped Moll . " Is the chamber not satis-factory ? " " It is not , " answered Matthew coldly . Again he ordered them to look in the wardrobe . Moll snorted with discontent and , her husband following , marched toward the wardrobe and looked in , Edward holding the candles high so that the interior was fully illuminated . For a moment there was no response from either Moll or Cuth ;  |p61then  Moll let out a great bellow of grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " she cried . " It 's Nebuchadnezzar . It 's my dear , sweet cat that I loved before all the world . " " And , more important , a human soul , treacherously used , " Matthew said . " It 's Aileen Mogaill , " Cuth said in a shaking voice . " Why , we thought she had run away , like the others before her . " The old man tried to comfort his wife , but she would have no comfort . She kept lamenting the cat 's death . Matthew said something about going for the local constable , and Moll suddenly stopped her blubbering and turned her face toward him . " Oh , I would n't do that , " she said . " It will do little good for the girl and surely great harm to them that 's living . " " Why great harm ? " Joan asked before Matthew could . " John Andrewes  --  him that 's constable for the year  --  is a right blockhead , that 's the harm . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make nothing of this horror but to scratch the fleas in his beard and summon the coroner , who 's his match as a numbskull . " " Numbskull or not , he must be summoned , " Matthew said . " So goes the law . " " So may the law go for me , " Moll answered sharply . " But it 's more than law you 'll have when this gets out . " " Why , what do you mean ? " Joan asked . " Marry , I mean nothing less than there 'll be not a servant left in the castle , that 's what . All will fly , believe me . The Irish wenches , the lot , and you 'll have none come from the village or Buxton to take their places . A fine wedding the young mistress will have then , she and her bridegroom , alone in the castle . " " But this girl within the wardrobe has been murdered , " Matthew protested . " She came here of herself , she did , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for her own tragedy . " She should have known better than to haunt the Keep without companions . " Joan exchanged a puzzled glance with Matthew . There was obviously more to Moll 's concern than met the eye . " It 's the curse , the Challoner curse , " Cuth pronounced , casting a knowing look toward his wife . " Shut up , you old fool , " Moll said.  |p62Ignoring  this kindly admonition , Cuth commenced to stumble through an account of a decapitated baronet of ' l horncombe , with sufficient competence to send a shiver down Joan 's spine as he told his tale . Joan looked around the chamber when he was done . A fit chamber of horrors , this , with a notable history of monstrous acts , yet she did not believe for a moment Aileen Mogaill had been beheaded by a ghost . This was mortal mischief , she was sure ; nestling the dead cat in the girl 's arms was the bizarre humor of a sick mind , not the work of a tormented spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be summoned , " Matthew insisted . " Well , summon whom you please , " Moll said . " But if you do , you might well not unpack your gear , for it will be even as I have said . When this act is proclaimed , no servant will darken these doors . You will have the place to yourselves , and right welcome to it , and the mistress can marry elsewhere . " Moll stood , her arms akimbo , staring at Matthew as though to allow the full implication of her warning to settle , then she turned to Cuth and said , " Come , husband . We 've had our say . Let them agree who will . " The old couple marched out , and Matthew sent Edward to find something to cover the girl 's body . When Matthew and Joan were alone , Joan said , " Moll 's right , you know . Nothing can be more injurious to our efforts here than the news of this fresh and most blatant homicide . It will surely have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Surely you do n't believe this was the work of a ghost ? " Matthew said . " No , I do n't , " Joan said . " It may well be the work of the same hand that killed Sir John  --  although why he should have chosen to slaughter an innocent child is beyond reason . " " Well , there 's no help for it . The law is plain . " " The law is plain , but our course may vary and achieve the ends of justice after all , " Joan said . " What if we follow Moll 's advice ? " " What ? " Matthew said incredulously . " Say nothing ? " " For the present , at least . Until evidence of both this and Sir John 's murder is brought to light . " Matthew went over to the bed and sat down ; his face took onp63the expression it had when he was deep in some perplexing problem . Joan understood her husband 's dilemma . A man of rigorous probity , zealous to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depart from the prescribed path , and particularly one first recommended by someone he disliked . " It 's not , after all , as though her murderer will go unlooked to , " Joan reasoned . " You are the Queen 's agent by her express command . It is only the outward trappings of official inquiry that will be postponed . You , as Queen 's officer , will investigate secretly  --  and with such subterfuge , we 'll not alarm the castle or put to flight our suspects at the very time we need them close at hand . " " And to those who know the truth  --  the Fludds and Edward Bastian  --  we will seem to have acted only out of policy . " " A more subtle policy than they suppose , " she added , putting the capstone on her argument . " And there 'll be no meddlesome local constables to muddy the waters . " Matthew thought some more . He stood and paced the chamber a few times , glanced toward the wardrobe , and shook his head . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he said . " We 'll go find the Fludds and tell them we have decided to follow their counsel . Then we 'll see to the burial of Aileen Mogaill in some private place until time and circumstances make the cause of these horrors plain . Meanwhile the other servants can continue to believe the girl fled . If Moll speaks true , the fiction will be readily credited . " " All well and good , " Joan said , smiling faintly , although her headache had returned with a vengeance . " As for this chamber , I 'll not spend the night here , nor in the tower , either , but in the new house if I must lie all night upon the floor , which I would fain do soon . I am weary and sick of heart , and my head pounds to let the poor brain free . " " You do look ill , " Matthew said with sudden concern . " I 'll lead you to other quarters , then Edward and I will see to the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , with pious words said above it , though no priest nor public mourning . Meanwhile I pray this sickness of yours has no more grievous cause than horror at finding Aileen Mogaill 's body and exhaustion from the long journey.  |p64Next  morning , the rain fell remorselessly , and Moll 's grief passed the understanding of her husband , who stood slightly behind her , a supportive hand on her elbow . He knew she could think only of the dead cat , the worthy Nebuchadnezzar , while he tried vainly to think of everything but the human remains in the wardrobe . They both looked down at the cat , stiff in its little shroud of dirty cloth . Edward had brought the body round early to the lodge . The hostler looked grief-striken too , although for cat , maid , or both , Cuth Fludd could n't tell . " A poor , innocent creature , Nebuchadnezzar was , " Moll said , sobbing softly . " Would to God I had an account of his end . " " Well , " said Cuth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat died of apoplexy . He was very old . " Moll turned slowly , wiped a tear from her red cheeks , and regarded her husband with contempt . " Just died ? Of old age ? Apoplexy , say you ? Why , you old fool , he was in his prime . " Moll knelt down slowly , as she might have done before a religious relic , and examined the body , tenderly touching the fur , stroking the animal 's side . Then she gasped and said : " No Challoner ghost did this . Look here , he 's been strangled , strangled dead ! " Both Cuth and Edward joined in the inspection and were forced to confirm Moll 's finding . The cat had been strangled , no doubt about it.  |p65Moll  rose and began propounding several theories of the murder with a completeness of thought suggesting she had already been considering such a possibility : that Aileen Mogaill was the perpetrator , or one of the other servants , taking their resentment of her , Moll , out on a poor dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had treated her with such rudeness . Finally , Moll 's speculations brought her to Joan Stock as a culprit . " I 'll warrant the Stock woman killed him , " she said . " Out of pure spite . " Edward said he thought that unlikely . He said the cat had obviously been dead for several days , if stench were any clue . Certainly that should exclude Joan Stock and her husband from Moll 's list of suspects . But Moll made a face to suggest that any effort to absolve the newcomers of responsibility was unwelcome . Terrible in her new spirit of vengeance , she said , " I hate them both , and more particularly the woman . Come , Cuth . Help me bury our darling as befits his character as a good cat . And damned be she who strangled him . " Cuth began to scoop up the cat but Moll said , " Not in that filthy rag , you dolt ! Fetch clean linen from the sideboard and bring it straightway . " Cuth went to do as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry I brought your cat to you , Moll . I should have buried it myself . " " No , " Moll said . " You did the right thing . The decent thing . When one 's beloved is taken by violence as in this case , it must be known . How else can justice be served ? I 'm only a bitter woman  --  made more bitter still by life 's misfortunes . But even I know that . No , murder will out , or so they say . " All this Moll declared with great dignity , tears streaming down her cheeks and her fist clutched to her bosom in a gesture of determination . Cuth reappeared . He was carrying a piece of cloth of appropriate quality . Moll inspected it and said it would serve ; she handed it to Edward , who placed the cat upon it and wrapped it up again . The three of them stepped out into the rain and walked toward the woods . The trees provided some shelter from the drizzle . Edward found a suitable spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft . Having no shovel , he dug the grave with his hands , raking up the moist earth with his fingers . He took the body from Moll , who had carried it to the burial place , and gently laid it into the hole . The grave Edward had dug was not quite deep enough and he had to dig it deeper . Then the fit was perfect . Edward covered the body while above him Moll said , " May she howl in hell a thousand nights who did this . " The curse was the cat 's epitaph . After the burial Moll went off to the castle kitchen to find some sweet to console her grief , while Cuth returned to the lodge and stoked the fire to dry his bones . He had got drenched there in the woods , bound as he had been to observe decorum at Nebuchadnezzar'sfuneral , but the worse was the image of cruel murder and mayhemthe cat 's burial had brought to his mind . Somewhere in the same woods Aileen Mogaill was buried . Cuth was thankful he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drew his stool up toward the flames . How good the heat felt . Wet weather was not good for his old body , nor was his recent change in habitations . He was used to his quarters in the new house , having dwelt there a score of years or more in perfect felicity ( his relationship with Moll was another matter altogether ) . The lodge was not only tumbledown , but the suffering he endured from aches in his joints and the hacking cough the proximity of water aggravated was almost as painful a cross as the humiliation of his forced retirement . Feeling better now , he thought of Nebuchadnezzar  --  this time without an accompanying image of Aileen Mogaill . Cuth had always hated the cat , hated its outlandish , heathen name , given it by Moll from the days of her religious phase , the only remnant of which now was her virulent anti-papistry . She had heard the name Nebuchadnezzar in a sermon , liked it , and was wont to explain the name was that of one of the Twelve Apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth was that Cuth had strangled it himself . He had stumbled out of bed the first night in the lodge , disoriented by the unfamiliar surroundings . In desperate need of the chamber pot , he had stepped on the creature 's tail , heard a snarl , felt a painfulp67retaliatory nip into the thin flesh of his ankle . With a dexterity that amazed him in recalling it , Cuth had reached down , seized his assailant by the scruff of the neck , and dispatched it without a thought of the consequence . The miracle was that his wife had not been awakened by the sounds of combat . By morning light he realized what he.had done . Feeling no remorse , only regret that he should now have to dispose of the evidence of his wrongdoing , he pulled the limp body from beneath the bed and stole out of the lodge , intending a hasty burial somewhere in the woods . It was only after he had covered the body with a thin layer of dirt and old leaves and had returned to the lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the day before the arrival of the new steward and housekeeper , he had exhumed Nebuchadnezzar from his shallow grave and concealed him in the wardrobe . He knew that his wife had finished her work there . It was all she spoke of  --  how she hated the Keep and how she wished the Stocks what joy they 'd find there . Soon , Cuth knew , the cat would be all maggoty and reeking  --  and a fine welcome he should give the interlopers . That Moll now held the Stocks responsible for the cat 's murder was a measure of luck he had not bargained for . Nor , for that matter , the terrible thing that had happened to the girl , the very thought of which caused such a turbulence in his gut that he wished to heaven his wife were present to distract him from it . When he had taken the cat to the wardrobe , the wardrobe had been empty . Of that he could swear upon a dozen Bibles if he was required . The murder of Aileen Mogaill must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of night . And by some old Challoner offended by the girl 's solitary trespass . Was not the beheading of the victim clear evidence of a malign spirit ? Cuth knew all the old stories of the castle  --  and he believed a goodly share of them as much as he believed in the existence of God , witches , devils , and other supernatural forces in his world . But what Cuth could not fathom was this : surely Aileen Mogaill had not been the first servant to wander into the Black Keep alone . Why this sudden fury of a ghost content for all the years of Cuth 's service to claim no more than a rumored existence ? He was still pondering these perplexing matters an hour later when a knocking snatched him from his meditations . At first hep68thought it was his wife , kicking at the door because her arms would be full . He responded accordingly  --  with great haste , to open before she began a clamorous complaint . But it was not Moll . It was Edward , standing there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been the sunniest day in July . Cuth asked Edward what he wanted . " Only a little talk with you , friend . A privy talk , if you please . " " A privy talk ? " Cuth replied , eyeing the hostler suspiciously and feeling greatly bereft of his wife 's presence . " About what ? " " Your good wife 's cat , that 's what , " Edward said , coming inside without invitation . Cuth knew something was wrong , and he found himself trembling a little . He shut the door against the rain and turned toward his uninvited guest , waiting to hear what Edward 's visit was all about . " I 've been thinking , thinking of murder , " Edward said slowly . Cuth thought he meant Aileen Mogaill and said , " Why , the ghost did it , killed the girl and the cat as well . Or it was that Stock woman who killed the cat , as my wife supposes . " Edward laughed mirthlessly , his face taut . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll believe it , not before . I did take a close look at your wife 's cat , though . I found pieces of dirt in its fur , yea , in the nostrils . Your wife 's inspection of her darling was n't very thorough . " " Whereby you conclude what ? " " Why , someone killed the cat , buried him , and then dug him up again  --  carried him to the Black Keep as an afterthought . The cat was stone cold before the Stocks arrived , before Aileen Mogaill was dead . Any fool can see that . Besides , why would they have killed the cat and left him to rot in their own wardrobe ? I doubt neither knew the cat was Moll 's . But someone hated the Stocks , hated them before setting eyes on them , and that was Moll  --  and you . " You 're not saying my wife killed her own cat ? " Cuth exclaimed , as much amused as astonished at the accusation . " Of course not , " Edward said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the case is not the same with you . You 'd strangle thep69cat soon enough because you could never abide the thing and then conceal it in the wardrobe to annoy the Stocks  --  and perhaps even make them look guilty . " " So you reason , " Cuth responded with ineffectual sarcasm after he had paused for a moment to take in all that Edward had said . His trembling was worse now ; it had begun to affect his voice , and Cuth was sure Edward could detect it as well . He would have demanded that the hostler leave his premises had he not been driven with such a desire to know what Edward intended to do with his terrible knowledge . " Your wife will reason likewise when I lav out the facts , " the hostler continued with easy assurance . " It 'll be as plain as your scabby nose . When she finds out it was you who deprived her of her darling , it 'll go hard with you . " " You can tell her what you please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were true but already feeling his fate cast . Edward laughed . " There 's more , you know . " " More ? " " Maybe if you strangled the cat , you dispatched Aileen thereafter . Now there 's something for a curious man to ponder , for I would as soon believe you did the deed as believe in some moldy ghost fetched forth from old servants ' tales . " " Killed the girl ! " Cuth explained , really alarmed now . " Why , I never did such a thing . " He felt the blood drain from his face and his whole body quiver as though he had been struck with the palsy . " I confess I strangled the cat . I confess it , but before God , I had not jot or tittle to do with Aileen Mogaill , not since she came to Thorncombe . I never so much as looked her way . " Transfixed between insult and terror , Cuth felt hot tears run down his cheeks , and he was ashamed to weep before his accuser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and a skeptical expression in his eyes . " Will you say aught to my wife about the cat ? " Cuth brought himself to ask , having decided he had no alternative but to throw himself upon the hostler 's mercy . For a few moments Edward made no response . He looked as though he were trying to make up his mind , weighing the advantages of silence against those of revelation . Finally , he said ,  | " Maybe yes , maybe no . The same goes for my suspicions about you and Aileen Mogaill . " " For Christ 's sake , man  --  " " Make no appeals to Christ , you whited sepulcher , " Edward said , all smiles gone . " You are a self-confessed liar , for you looked upon two corpses and played a mighty hypocrite agog at your own villainy . So it will be thought since you killed the one creature , you probably killed the other too . " " Not if you say nothing , " Cuth pleaded , his pride totally gone now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly friendly again . " Oh , what must I do ? " Cuth begged.  |p71That  same morning , Matthew 's worst fears about Joan 's symptoms were confirmed . It was now plain that she had been stricken with a fever , ague , God knew what  --  aggravated to the quick by the ordeal of travel , the discovery of a dead woman in her wardrobe , and the commencement of the steady drizzle that seemed to permeate the stone walls of the castle and make all within damp , soggy , and joyless . Joan burned and shivered by turns , like a lover in an old sonnet , while Matthew , concerned that no physician was available to bleed , purge , or pronounce upon his wife 's urine , resorted to the few remedies he had learned at home  --  herbs , compresses , and earnest prayers for Joan 's delivery from evil . Joan was bedridden for three days , convalescing for another , sleeping upon rushes in the parlor of the new house where she and Matthew had established a temporary hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dared not trust Joan 's health or safety to another soul , given the evidence of homicidal madness in the castle . Was there anyone beyond suspicion ? Their investigation of Sir John 's and Aileen Mogaill 's murders was postponed , therefore , and even the normal course of their respective duties as housekeeper and steward suffered a necessary neglect , waiting upon Joan 's recovery . But recover she did , even in the absence of a physician and hisp72leeches , and Matthew took the first dry day thereafter to ride into Buxton , where he contrived to converse with the foreman of the coroner 's jury that had sat in Sir John 's case . The foreman , a lanky , talkative fellow named Broomfield , revealed that the verdict of death by misadventure had been reached for want of compelling evidence to the contrary . Matthew also learned that the suspicion that Sir John had been murdered was widespread . Matthew only needed to identify himself as the new steward of Thorncombe and he was deluged by volunteered information and gossip , local legends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was which , but he left town with the impression that , if but half of what he had heard was true , Thorncombe was a very sinister place indeed . The evening of the same day he spent a good six to eight hours poring over the former steward 's ledgers  --  not that he supposed he would discover in their yellowed , dog-eared pages evidence of Sir John 's murder , but because it was the thing a new steward was expected to do and he wanted to be perfect in his guise . Besides , as a merchant he was full of natural curiosity as to the estate 's income and expenditures . For all his faults , Cuth had been a meticulous record-keeper , or so Matthew inferred from the ledgers . The whole sad story was there : a tale of declining income offset by a reduction in servants , the sale of livestock , the pawn of plate and furnishings , and then , too , sudden and unexplained infusions of capital from unidentified sources . Matthew took careful note of all these details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any clear relation to Sir John 's death . For one thing , the ledgers did not give evidence of who , despite his heir , of course , might have benefited from the murder . Joan had discounted Frances Challoner as a suspect even before they left London . The pleasant young woman simply did not look the sort to commission a murder , which is what she would have had to do at such a remove . Moreover , it seemed unlikely to Joan that Frances Challoner would have sufficient motive to kill her uncle to secure land and chattels that would fall to her anyway in the course of time . " A jealous neighbor , then ? Perhaps a disgruntled servant ? " Matthew suggested.  | " If you are thinking of Moll , " Joan said , " I will readily grant that the woman has the disposition . Whether she had cause is another question . " The problem with all these deliberations was that , because of Joan 's illness , they had hardly begun to investigate matters or persons at the castle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , if one counted the days of travel from London to Derbyshire , as Matthew was convinced the Queen had . " Tomorrow , I intend to rise from my bed of affliction and go about my duties , ready or not , " Joan declared with grim determination . She was as frustrated as her husband by the delay in beginning their real work at Thorncombe . " And so you shall , " Matthew said . " But only if you 're able . The Queen 's business is important , but I 'll not sacrifice your health . " She was pleased by his concern and told him so , kissing him heartily on the lips and calling him sweetheart and other pet names she had for him , and they spent a pleasant hour in such amorous discourse , wherein she proved to the satisfaction of them both that she was a whole woman again . Later , Matthew said , " The sun has dried things out now . Tomorrow Edward will accompany me on a visit to the tenants ' farms . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may visit the neighbor , too . Stafford 's his name . Would n't hurt to introduce myself to him . I also want Edward to show me the exact place where Sir John drowned . " She warned him against making his interest in the death too obvious . He told her he would be discreet . " You 'll be gone all day , then , " she said . " Very likely . " " Well , see that you do n't lose your way in this wilderness . See that the hostler provides you with a good mount and no uppity stallion to break your neck with and  --  " She stopped when she saw the suppressed laughter in his eyes . Realizing that she was mothering him unconscionably , she flushed with embarrassment . Would she make her good man into another Cuth Fludd with all her admonishments , and herself a something worse thereby ? She knew Matthew was an able horseman . Never had he become lost that she remembered , nor had he ever beenp74thrown . She remembered , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood . She took Matthew 's hand and held it in a firm grasp . " Forgive me , " she said softly . " I did n't mean to treat you as a child . " With a good-natured laugh he bent and kissed her on the cheek . Then they walked downstairs and through the kitchen to the rear porch of the house . " You take care , " he said to her . " I would sooner face the menace of these lonely wastes than the dark passages of Thorncombe , where madmen lurk to do harm of nights . Are you sure you 're well enough to be up and about ? " She assured him she was . Over his shoulder , she saw Edward coming across the courtyard with a broad stride . Matthew turned away from her to the young hostler and greeted him . Then Joan watched as the two men went off toward the stable . She envied her husband a little for his day 's adventure , and yet she realized , too , that he was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had exaggerated her recovery . In fact , she felt weakened by her long sojourn in bed and she still had the sniffles . Besides , she thought in one last effort to expunge the demon of self-pity , why should she envy Matthew 's tour of smelly barns and tenants ' hovels ? As she turned to go into the house again , she thought of Moll . Had the old woman 's resentment and hostility not so poisoned their relationship , Joan would have had her predecessor for a guide to her new duties . But Joan would not want Moll for a guide now , nor did she suppose the old woman would offer her services . Joan 's illness had prevented a confrontation over the dead cat . It had also prevented any questions about Aileen Mogaill 's relations with the other servants . The decision to keep her murder a secret had made it seem , at four days ' remove , that the murder had never happened at all , that its hapless victim really had vanished into thin air . Joan found Una in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly accommodation and Joan felt a surge of fellow feeling for the Irishwoman . Although a foreigner and ignorant of the English tongue , Una seemed to be without guile . Even more to the point , she was no sourpuss , which was a welcome relief to Joan , whose natural inclination was to be friendly to all she met , save for knaves and fools , whom she did not suffer readily . She decided to ask Una to be her companion on her explora/tions of the castle . The problem was how to ask . At first , Joan put her request into simple English accompanied by such sign language that seemed , to Joan , to express her intent . To which the cook responded with an affable smile and an obvious failure to comprehend . Then Joan grasped Una 's arm and made gestures indicating the various regions of the house . This strategy proved more effective . Understanding shone in the Irishwoman 's eyes and she nodded her head vigorously and pointed to the passage leading to the deeper recesses of Thorncombe . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , since their arrival at Thorncombe , strolled curiously through the chambers of the new house and the castle and given her some report of his findings , so what Joan now saw in person was no surprise to her . The downstairs of the new house consisted of a spacious hall , an adjoining parlor or withdrawing room , a grand staircase , a dining room  --  in addition , of course , to these smaller rooms occupied by the household servants in the course of their duties : the kitchen , pantry , buttery , and steward 's office . All the larger rooms of the ground floor were sparsely furnished , as was befitting a master who had spent only a few months of the year in residence and had no wife or child to maintain and no interest in entertaining the local gentry . The Challoner hounds had been sold at their master 's death , so that there was little sign now of canine damage , although there was a slight lingering odor . Joan noticed a layer of dust here and there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had organized the maids . Access to the upper floor of the house would have been most convenient by the grand staircase , and in her capacity as head housekeeper she might have properly ascended by this route , especially in the absence of the mistress of the house . But to set an example for her companion , Joan ascended the back staircase , wedged between the steward 's tiny office and the buttery and so narrow as to require the two women to climb single file . The stairs led to a long gallery that afforded a fine view of the woods and lake . The interior wall opposite was hung with family portraits  --  a grim line of baronets , most in armor , with each portrait marked with the Challoner crest , a chevron surmounted by a boar 's head . Between the portraits were doors , which upon inspectionp76proved to give access to mostly unfurnished bedchambers . One , however , opened to a suite of chambers , which Joan surmised both by their size and superior furnishings had been Sir John 's . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the apartment and muttered her late master 's name beneath her breath . Joan did not compel Una to follow her into the apartment . She did not think to find evidence of Sir John 's murder there , but she did feel she might sense something in the chambers that would give her a better idea of the dead man 's character . Her sensitivity , she believed , would be the greater if she was alone . But as she began to inspect the apartment , she recognized that changes had been made since Sir John 's death . The austere masculinity she was sure had characterized the room during the baronet 's occupation had been modified . Its wall hangings and embroidered coverlet , the tall cheval glass , and handsome turkey carpet of brilliant floral design suggested a feminine presence . Or at least the anticipation of such a presence . As she was admiring these furnishings and allowing herself a little vanity of studying her own reflection in the cheval glass  --  noting with some alarm her residual pallor  --  she heard an unfamiliarmasculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , she found Una conversing in Irish with a ruddy-complexioned young man of about thirty , dressed in canvas doublet with silk buttons and wearing a knife and sword . The man was broadshoulderedand thick-wristed . His calves , bulging beneath the cotton hose , were muscular , but his shanks were somewhat out of proportion to the rest of his body . His hands were large and hairy . He had the straight nose , large lips , and square jaw that many women would have found attractive . On seeing Joan , Una and the man ceased conversing , and the man introduced himself , in English , as Michael Conroy . At the same time he made a graceful bow to Joan , as though she were a gentlewoman . " You must be our new housekeeper , " Michael Conroy said . " I had heard you had fallen foul of some fever since you arrived here . I 'm pleased to see you so recovered . " She thanked him for his courtesy , wary of a certain flirtatious quality in the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of his presence in the house . She had heard about Sir John 's manservant from Matthew , who had spoken to him briefly the second day at Thorncombe , but had reported being unable to determine why he remained in the house , his master dead and buried . She decided to exert her authority and ask him outright what he did to pass his time . " Why , I wait upon Mistress Frances Challoner , " he said , lifting his eyes in surprise at the question and speaking in the same well-modulated voice as before . " I was her uncle 's personal servant . I am therefore a piece of his estate , which , upon my good master 's death , fell to his heir . " His pale handsome eyes flashed winningly . " Are you ? " Joan returned , not bothering to disguise the cynicism in her voice , for she was not sure whether what Conroy had said had any merit in law or was merely the witty retort of an obnoxious idler . " Indeed , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irishwoman was standing quietly staring at Joan . " It was Sir John 's express wish that I continue in the employ of the family . " " As a manservant ? " " As . . . whatever pleases my mistress . " " And you are under her orders ? " " I am . " " Do you have letters in hand declaring as much ? " Joan asked . Conroy paused and flashed another broad smile . He stroked his chin . " Well , I had such a letter . " " But you do not have it now ? " she said . " No . I 've misplaced it . " Joan decided it would be best to keep the upper hand in her catechism . She suspected Conroy was up to no good , and she did not like at all his masculine arrogance . " That 's very convenient for you  --  your misplacing it , " she said . " And , pray , how do you spend your time in the interval ? " " The interval ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Between your master 's death , before which you had clearly defined duties , and your mistress 's coming , which may be a month or more from now . " " Ah , yes , " he said . " Well , I read . . .. I care for Sir John 's papers.  | " His papers ? What papers ? " " His diary , his letters , " Conroy answered . The old smile returned . But Joan suspected the Irishman was a varlet of the first order . She could read the insolence in his eyes . Had she not seen it often before  --  in saucy tradesmen and apprentices and city constablescontemptuous of honest country people such as herself ? " His papers record his experiences in Ireland , " Conroy continued , more boldly . " Sir John was a famous soldier . His papers have importance as . . . historical documents . " But Joan was not to be cowed by learned phrases , especially not from the lips of a smooth-talking Irishman . " Historical documents indeed ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no antiquary or scholar but do little else here but be idle , which you might as well accomplish in the stable , if your legs will bear you the distance . " At this remark , Conroy 's countenance changed utterly . His brow furrowed and he seemed to grow taller before her . " I am Mistress Frances Challoner 's servant , " he declared coldly . " As are you , Mistress Stock . It is her command that sends me packing , or bids me stay , not yours . " Joan was about to tell Conroy just what authority she had been given when she was prevented by Una , who put a hand on Conroy 's arm and said something in Irish to pacify him . For a moment Conroy continued to glare threateningly at Joan , then his anger seemed to subside . He stepped back from her and put his hands behind his back and rocked on the balls of his feet . " Very well , very well , " he said . " I suppose Edward will share a bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses . But I warn you , my mistress will not be pleased to find out how I have been used . " " If she is not pleased , then I will suffer her displeasure , " Joan said , keeping her voice steady . " In the meantime , collect your gear and move from the house . There 's much to be done here to make things ready for Mistress Frances Challoner , and it will not do to have you under foot . " Joan left Una and Conroy standing in the gallery while she went back into the master 's apartment , not so much because she had not seen enough there but because she wanted to terminate a discussion that had become increasingly heated and dangerous . She thanked God for Una 's timely intercession , but wondered what the woman had said to mollify Conroy.  |p79She  went over to the cheval glass and looked at her reflection . At least the confrontation with Conroy had brought some color to her cheeks . She looked around the chambers some more but found nothing that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death or to his maid 's . When she returned to the gallery she found Una waiting . Conroy , Joan was happy to see , had gone . She told Una she was ready to continue their excursion and Una looked pleased to be going . Yet suddenly , and unaccountably , Joan felt less secure in Una 's company than before . Was it only because Una had exchanged words with Conroy in a language unknown to Joan , or was there something more sinister that Joan sensed ? Still rankled somewhat over her quarrel with Conroy , she now tried to focus her thoughts on the matter at hand , for she could not forget the ulterior motive of her tour . At least she had had a glimpse of Conroy 's violent nature  --  and could easily add him to her list of suspects . Indeed , Conroy was now the chief ! He had a blackguard 's smirk , the slippery manner of a backstairs villain , and that his sword was quite capable of Aileen 's murder was well within the circumferenceof belief . Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants about their master 's drowning , but the language barrier permitted only the most rudimentary communication and she hesitated to arouse suspicion . She did hope Matthew would learn something from Edward Bastian , who had become a co-conspirator in the hushing up of Aileen Mogaill 's murder and whose amiable deportment gave promise of further shared confidences . Una now led the way to the end of the gallery , where a little door opened to a steep flight of narrow stairs . They climbed and came to a low-ceilinged attic , where there were many small chambers furnished with straw pallets and other simple furnishings . One chamber , detached somewhat from the rest , had a good-size bed . Joan asked if this had been the Fludds ' quarters before their removal to the lodge , and Una , evidently understanding the question , nodded her assent . Joan looked around the chamber and decided that this should now be hers and Matthew 's . The small downstairs parlor that she and Matthew had occupied during her convalescence had beenp80adequate as a temporary refuge from the horrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for longer habitation . Joan made Una understand her intention of occupying the chamber forthwith , and the cook went off to secure help in transporting the Stocks ' things . While Una was gone , Joan inspected the chamber carefully . She was gratified to find no dead cats or even innocent relics of the Fludds ' recent occupancy , but she understood now , seeing how light , airy , and accessible these quarters were , the malignity that explained her and Matthew 's assignment to the Black Keep , and a new wave of resentment swept over her . She thought , too , about Michael Conroy and his impudence . She dearly hoped she would have no further trouble with the rogue and realized how right her husband had been when he had said there was more danger in Thorncombe 's passages than in the wastes of Derbyshire . Then Una returned and said something in Irish that Joan interpreted to mean her orders had been carried out and soon her belongings would be transferred to these new rooms . She smiled in approval , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were still parts of the old castle Joan had not seen which she felt came within her responsibility . Since , like the second story of the new house , the attic afforded no passage to the castle , Joan and Una were forced to retrace their steps . Joan led the way and the two women returned to the kitchen and from there passed through the cavernous banqueting hall . There was a cellar with stone walls and low vaulted ceiling that occupied their attention in between . Like many a chamber of Thorncombe it was empty , and its rough walls oozed with moisture . The place was dark and dank like most cellars and had no particular interest to Joan . Their visit was therefore brief and Joan indicated that she wanted to visit the White Keep without further ado . Each of Thorncombe 's keeps had its own staircase , located to the left and right of the dais and hearth , and extending upward and outward in a graceful arc . The two women climbed the stairs to the left of the dais and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement of chambers in the White Keep was identical to that in the Black . A large bedchamber and several smaller rooms werep81separated by a narrow corridor at the end of which was a tall , unglazed window . The large White Keep chamber proved to be a repository of trash  --  boxes and old casks , discarded furniture , much of it broken  --  an arsonist 's delight . Joan found moldering in one corner an old arras with faded scenes of castles and ships and a battered chest full of rusting weaponry , chain mail , and old tools some stonemason had left behind years earlier . The windows afforded the same view as those in her former quarters . While Joan was conducting this inspection , Una remained in the corridor . When Joan had concluded , she noticed the anxious expression of her companion and suggested they take a quick look at what remained and then go downstairs . Una seemed to understand this communication and smiled gratefully . The first of the remainingrooms was empty . There was little evidence that the room had ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery . The door was equipped with a lock , but Joan found no key in her collection that would fit . She was puzzled . Why should this room be locked when the others were n't ? She was contemplating this question when she heard somethingstirring on the other side of the door . She was n't sure if it was a footstep or the rustle of a gown . Then she heard what sounded very much like a muffled cough . She looked at Una and knew that the Irishwoman had heard the noise as well . Una 's eyes were large with fear . Joan rapped sharply on the door . " I know there 's someone there , " she called . " Open at once . " But Joan 's commands had no effect , and although she heard no more movement within the room , she had the absolute conviction that someone was there . When subsequent knocking met with equal failure , she ordered Una to remain by the door while she went to find Moll . Una seemed very reluctant . " Stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p82Matthew  looked for Edward in the stable but the young hostler was n't there . The stable door gaped wide , admitting a generous swath of sunlight into the dusty , horsey interior . The horses were standing in the paddock , and the broken harness draped on the workbench with the mending tools at hand suggested that Edward had been about his business earlier that morning , had been interrupted , and would presently return . Matthew was content to wait , glad for a chance to look around on his own . The stable , pleasantly redolent with the smell of beast , straw , leather , and horse dung , was old but in good repair , with a sound roof and sturdy timbered walls . It had been constructed to house a veritable herd of animals but provided for only a small number now . Most of the stalls appeared to be unused ; several had been converted to storage of hay . In the back of the stable was a small room outfitted with a pallet where , Matthew presumed , Edward slept . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly array of knives , auls , mallets , and pikes . The knives were sharp and arranged according to size . The tools Edward had been using to mend the harness were placed at right angles like a table setting at a feast . The bench itself was smooth and brushed clean of scraps and dirt . There were a small forge and bellows , a blacksmith 's tongs and hammer.  |p83Then  a shadow fell across the sunlit doorway and Matthew looked up to see Edward standing there . " Good day to you , Edward . " For a moment Edward said nothing . He seemed startled , and Matthew wondered if he had offended the hostler by invading his domain while Edward was absent . But what should he have done ? And after all , he was the steward of the house . He asked if Edward would keep him company on his rounds . Edward , relaxing , it seemed to Matthew , said he would . " I looked around the stables while you were out . All seems in good order . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuth 's ledger . " Matthew reached in his pocket and pulled out a crumpled sheet of paper on which he had written the names . " I see one of the tenants is named Bastian . Would that be one of your kin ? " " My father , " Edward answered . " He occupies a mean cottage on a small parcel of land  --  it 's hardly worth a visit . " " Perhaps not , but I will want to meet your father all the same , " Matthew said . The two men walked out into the paddock . " We 'll ride , " Edward said , eyeing the horses . " It 's four or five miles to the farthest tenant . " " I want to call upon Master Stafford as well . " " Yes , sir . His property lies to the north of here , but he 'll give us a cold welcome . " " Cold , why ? " " An old grudge  --  a dispute over the lake and the dam that made it . " Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gelding with a fine-shaped head . He patted it on the withers and whispered something in its ear . Matthew came up behind the hostler and said , " You know , I think I 'd like to take a look at the lake before we ride . " Edward turned sharply ; his eyes were puzzled . " The lake ? Why , there 's nothing to see there that ca n't be seen from the house . " " I know , but I feel obliged to see everything . " Edward shrugged and patted the horse on the rump ; it trotted off . He walked back through the stable door with Matthew . Matthew followed the hostler around the stable to where a pathp84led through the woods . They walked a hundred yards or so through dense foliage until the lake came into view . Matthew stood on a high , slippery bank overlooking the water , which even on a fair day had a strangely leaden hue . He noticed an unpleasant smell and asked Edward about it . " The water , " Edward said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one is sure why . Sir John made the lake , you know , not nature . That is , he caused the lake to be made . Before his time there was a good running stream and marsh . Sir John had been south and had seen some great house there Earl of Leicester . " " The same , " Edward said . " That castle , I have heard tell , had a moat , a very fine broad one . Sir John wanted the same . He hired a French engineer to build an earthwork dam against the stream that coursed through the valley . A hillock called hereabout , the thorn , ' became the island you see yonder . " " And the little pile of stones upon it ? " Matthew asked , casting an eye across the water . " A replica of Thorncombe 's towers  --  or at least one of them . A pure novelty , for it has no practical use , being hardly large enough for a tall man to stand upright . " " You 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's nothing more to see than what you see at this distance , I assure you . " " But the water is foul , " Matthew said . " It is indeed , " Edward said with an ironical laugh . " As the waters rose they found something strange and malignant in the ground they covered . Instead of being deep and clear and sweet as the natural lakes of the region , Sir John 's was warm , murky , and foul-smelling . Some of the neighbors said it was God 's judgment for Sir John 's presumption . Lakes were God 's work , not man 's  --  or so they said . Some more charitable said the smell was caused by seepage from old lead mines . They counseled Sir John to seek some learned man conversant with the properties of stones and rocks  --  they thought the water might be a cure like St. Ann 's in Buxton . But the lake proved to have no such virtue . Sir John stocked the lake with fish but they all died ; the jackdaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal about your late master 's history , " Matthew remarked , turning from his inspection of the lake to his young companion . " These things happened almost before my time . My father told me of them , for he too was a servant in the castle and knew Sir John , his brother that died in the Irish wars , and the father before them . " " I have heard Sir John drowned in this very lake , " Matthew said . " On the day of his homecoming . " " You 've heard true , then , " said Edward . The hostler pointed to a spot on the lakeshore . " We found him down there  --  Cuth and I  --  where the shore curves inward . " Matthew could see the place , a stretch of rock and pebbles , and started to walk in its direction . He climbed down the bank . The odor of the water , reminding him of something he had once smelled in an alchemist 's den in the final stages of distillation , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ littered with dead branches . " Is the water deep then ? " Matthew asked Edward , who had followed him down from the bank . " Some of it is , some is n't , " Edward answered , picking up a smooth stone and flinging it out across the water . " There were old lead mines and potholes in the valley before the lake was made . The water covered them . But most of it is shallow , not more than four or five feet , I should judge . " " Sir John could n't swim ? " " Oh , he could , " said Edward . " He could wade as familiarly through rivers as a water spaniel , or so the Irish manservant tells the tale . But he lost his leg , you see , in Ireland . He came home with a wooden one and was not yet recovered fully from the surgeon 's knife . " " He was in a weakened condition , then ? " Matthew asked , turning to look at the hostler , whose expression suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ridden a long day the day of his death , " Edward said . " That 's strange that he should choose to go out on the water on such a day , in such a condition . Was the weather fair ? " " The weather was miserable , " said Edward . " An unseasonable tempest . "  | " The stranger , then , " Matthew said . " Why should a soldier , convalescing from surgery and weary from a long , exhausting ride , choose to go boating on the lake ? And in a tempest ? " Edward seemed to think about this . Shrugging , he said , " We do n't know what time he set out . The weather was n't so bad earlier . The tempest came of a sudden , as I remember . For his other reasons , I did not think it was my place to inquire . " Edward 's tone suggested that the question was equally impertinenton Matthew 's part . Matthew decided to change subjects . " I see no shallop or other craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agreed . He said he did n't know where the shallop was . Its care had been the charge of Sir John 's manservant . Edward said he himself was no sailor and water made him queasy . Matthew decided he had seen enough of the lake . He was satisfied that even if he had been at liberty to search the scene of Sir John 's drowning in private , he would have discovered nothing more than what was in plain view . It had been over a year since the drowning . There had likely never been evidence of foul play , and had there been , it would long earlier have been removed by weather or will of him who had done the deed . But there remained another question he wanted to put to the hostler , a question that had been bothering Matthew since the night they had discovered Aileen Mogaill 's body and Edward had helped Matthew bury it . " It was a dreadful thing that happened to the girl , " Matthew said offhandedly , as though he had introduced the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up the bank and walk through the woods to the paddock again . " It was , in truth , " Edward answered solemnly . " Who did it , do you think ? Was it the Challoner ghost , as Cuth affirms ? " Edward scoffed at the idea . " Cuth is a fool . His wife 's another . " " Who , then ? " Edward stopped ; he had been leading the way back . He said , " Live men wield swords more often than the spirits of dead folks do , I warrant . But I 'd as lief believe some tramp or roving bedlamite made the keep his bed for the night and did murder for lust and madness 's sake than in a ghost 's revenge . I tell you it would n't be thep87first time the old castle has had uninvited guests . In summer theroads are full of vagabonds . I sometimes have found them sleeping in the stable or in the field . I 've given them something to eat and sent them on their way  --  before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is . Whacks them with her cudgel she does . A very hard woman . " " Aileen was killed by a passing stranger , you think ? " " Why , it 's an explanation good as any other . What think you , Master Stock ? " " Why , I agree it 's an explanation as good as any other , " Matthew answered , because he could think of nothing else to say and because it suddenly occurred to him that the hostler 's theory could be sound . Matthew waited by the paddock fence while Edward got the horses . Soon Edward was returning , leading a bay gelding and sorrel mare . Matthew watched while the hostler saddled both . Meanwhile the young man talked casually of horses , about which he obviously knew a great deal . He did have something to say about the castle 's tenants , too . " It 's always bad when the master is an absentee landlord , as Sir John so often was . " Edward said the tenants were an uncouth , unruly lot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not he a pleasant one . Edward 's words turned out to be true . The next several hours he took Matthew to a series of habitations that were little better than hovels , where the denizens spoke such a thickly accented local dialect as to be virtually incomprehensible , and where there was little welcome for the new steward . The tenants seemed indeed an ignorant and complaining brood ; they regarded Matthew with suspicion and whispered among themselves . Matthew left them behind in relief that his position as steward was a temporary guise . But then he remembered they had not yet visited the cottage of Edward 's father . He reminded Edward of the fact . " My father 's cottage is no better than the others you 've seen , " Edward said . Matthew detected the hostler 's reluctance , but was not content to let the visit pass . He might feel compelled to disguise his curiosity about Sir John 's drowning , but he was certainly under no obligationp88to do likewise with one of the tenant 's cottages . " We can spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , " Edward said , " if it is your pleasure . " Matthew assured him it was . They traveled along the road for some way , passing several of the tenant cottages they had already visited , and Matthew realized that Edward had deliberately avoided the byroad which would have brought them to the cottage sooner . " My father is not well , " Edward said . " He 's like a child sometimes , at others like his old self . Half blind too . Death will come as a blessing to him , but that 's in God 's hands . " " So there 's just your father and you at the cottage ? " Matthew asked . " We two . When he fell ill and could no longer take care of himself , I moved from the stable to the cottage to become his companion and nurse . So I have done these twelve months . " " It 's a fortunate father who has so dutiful a son , " Matthew remarked approvingly . Despite the hostler 's disparaging comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into view suggested a higher level of existence than those Matthew had previously visited that day . It was situated in a little clump of trees and had a roof of new thatch and a chimney from which a thin curl of smoke could be seen . The yard was girded by a sturdy picket fence in good repair , and inside the compound and before the front door an assortment of ducks , geese , and chickens was hunting and pecking , while at the side of the cottage there was a neatly tended kitchen garden and a shed . Edward said he would ride ahead and announce their coming . " We rarely have visitors to the cottage , and your sudden appearance may startle my father . " Matthew was about to protest that he hardly thought himself a presence that should alarm an aging invalid , when Edward put his words into action and went galloping toward the cottage , leaving Matthew to follow at leisure . At Edward 's advance , a large dog of indeterminate breed crept from beneath bushes growing near the cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whichp89he was tethered . Edward dismounted , tied his horse to the fence , and bounded into the cottage . By the time Matthew had reached the fence , Edward reappeared in the doorway , smiling and beckoning Matthew to come in . Although several inches below mean height , Matthew had to duck his head to clear the lintel before stepping down on a hard earthen floor . The interior of the cottage was a single room at the far end of which was a hearth of ragged stone with a good fire going . Beside it was a battered cupboard , heavy with pots and crocks and other implements of rural housekeeping . There was a square oak table that might seat four with luck , a bench , several stools , two pallets , one larger than the other , and a large chest . Although it was a humble dwelling and the furnishings no better than to be expected , everything was neat and orderly . Certainly , there was not the squalor Matthew associated with the houses of old invalids and frisky young bachelors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vase on the square table , a touch that reminded Matthew of something his wife might have done . But of greatest interest to Matthew was not the furnishings of the cottage but its human occupant . On a stool near the hearth , his palms outstretched toward the fire as though he were trying to keep the heat it generated at a distance , sat an old man of fifty-five or sixty with thinning gray hair and scraggly beard , and an expression  --  Matthew noticed as the aged face turned in his direction  --  suggesting not so much deficiency of sight as indifference to what he looked upon . Edward 's father , for Matthew supposed this to be he , was broad-shouldered and sinewy like the son and he wore the garments of a rustic , except on his feet were slippers rather than boots or shoes . His complexion was darker than Edward 's and his nose had once been broken , for it veered toward the left part of the face , where there was a noticeable tic . It was in the vacancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man 's decrepitude . It was clear now why Edward felt obligated to look after his father : the elder Bastian was a man living in body beyond the mind 's strength to govern it , an unfortunate adjunct of age Matthew had observed in many of his fellow townsmen . " Master Stock , this is my father , Hugh Bastian. "  |p90Matthew  said something about being pleased to meet the oldman , but Hugh Bastian turned his face back toward the fire . " My father speaks little now , " Edward said apologetically . " Please do n't think him disrespectful or rude . " Matthew assured Edward that he had taken no offense at his father 's mute response . He complimented the hostler on the cottage 's condition . Edward made a motion to leave . But Matthew was not finished with his inspection . He walked a little farther into the room , taking as much in as he could , sensing that Edward was trying to hurry him out , and not sure why . He saw that the fire that warmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only begun to burn . Who had laid the fire ? The decrepit old man ? The strong hostler , who only a few moments earlier had raced for the cottage and leapt off his horse to run indoors so that his father would not be alarmed by a stranger 's appearance ? One of them would not have had the strength , the other lacked the time . Here was a mystery . Matthew said good-bye to the elder Bastian and was following Edward out the door when he noticed a cerecloth hanging on a wall . He thought perhaps a recess was behind it and would have gone boldly over to see for himself had he not thought the action would offend the hostler . He decided to leave his curiosity unsatisfied , and continued on into the yard . His emerging from the cottage sparked another burst of canine fury . Matthew jumped backward in alarm , crying out to Edward for help . Edward ordered the dog to be silent . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " Since you 're an honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dog kept barking despite Edward 's reprimands . The two men walked hurriedly across the yard . Matthew felt better when he was on the other side of the fence . He turned back and looked at the dog and the cottage . It was then that , for all the dog 's uproar , Matthew heard the cry of an infant . The small plaintive note was almost lost in the noise of the animal , but Matthew was sure that it was a human cry he had heard and that it had come from inside the cottage . When the two men were mounted again , Matthew said , " Strange , but while your dog railed , I thought I heard a child within . "  |p91Matthew  noticed that at the remark Edward 's face tightened . But then the hostler grinned broadly and said , " A child ? Why , there 's no child here , sir , unless you count the youngest of the servants , who may be no more than twelve or thirteen . " " None ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you saw , and the Robinsons . " Matthew remembered the grim and grimy little faces of the children of the two families . He supposed the women of the cottages had infants as well , somewhere within the dismal dwellings he had not inclined nor been invited to enter . But the sound Matthew had heard had issued from the Bastian cottage . Edward led the way to the road again without there being any other mention of the child . The hostler seemed nervous , however , and this strengthened Matthew 's conviction that Edward was hiding something  --  or someone . But who  --  the person who had laid the fire ? The person whose child had cried ? As he rode he wondered if he should not have looked behind the cloth . What would he have found there ? He reasoned that an infant concealed in the cottage strongly implied the existence of a mother , and perhaps her presence . Was Edward wived then ? Encumbered with child ? And what if he was ? Even in Derbyshire there was no law against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bastard , still , where was the purpose ? Edward was no gentleman or scholar with a reputation to protect ; only a hostler whose personal morals were expected to be no higher than his calling . Matthew resolved not to dispute with Edward over the matter . What would a confrontation produce ? Vigorous denials ? Open hostility ? And yet Matthew knew what he had heard , and he suspected Edward had heard the cry as well . When they came up to the junction of the roads , Edward broke his silence and said , " 1 ' 11 take you to Stafford 's now . It 's about five miles . " Matthew nodded his approval , and Edward turned his horse off the road and started out across a stretch of damp ground until they came to a horse trail . This they followed for about half an hour until they reached a road . They traveled it , not talking further.  |p92It  was past noon now . Matthew was hungry , but since there was no prospect of satisfying his hunger , he suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mound of earth that in the smoothness of contour did not seem the work of nature . The mound was off of the road some distance . He asked Edward about it . " That 's a barrow , as we call them hereabouts , " Edward explained , pausing to view the sight . " The ancients buried their dead in them . " " The ancients ? " " The old ones . Those who lived here at first . Before the Saxons , before the Romans , even . We 're riding upon an old Roman road , you know . If you look sharp , you can still see the stones . But the Roman and the Saxon were newcomers to this ground . The barrow-builders were first , and that is one of their tombs . " Interested , Matthew asked if there were many harrows in the neighborhood . " A good many , " replied Edward , warming to his office as guide . " Some have been dug up . Bones , weapons , spears , arrowheads  --  sometimesrings and bracelets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans used to mine here . They say a cobbler of Buxton discovered in one barrow an immense treasure of gold , but died before he could recover it . When his wife went to where the treasure was supposed to be , she found naught but a pot of lead . They who are familiar with such matters say the treasure was cursed  --  as was he who disturbs the ancient bones , wherefore the man died . " " It 's a wicked thing to disturb the dead , even if they are long gone to dust , " Matthew reflected , although he was unsure as to how much credence to place in stories of curses and buried treasures . Beyond the barrow were hills and there sheep could be seen as well as the lone figure of a sheepherder . " Those are Stafford 's sheep , " Edward said , moving forward again . He talked over his shoulder as he rode . " The old barons of Thorncombe kept large herds , but Sir John had no interest in sheep . He called them filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . He let the herd decline and sold off the rest . First and last he was a soldier . He cared for little more . "  |p93Matthew  listened with interest . He looked up at the hills and thought it was a sad thing that the herd had been sold . He asked Edward to tell him more about Stafford . Edward pointed ahead of them . " Yonder you can see a little ravine and wooden bridge . When we cross , we 'll be on Stafford 's land . " Matthew saw the ravine and the bridge  --  and at a greater distance he now could see a sprawling manor house . " There 's Stafford Hall , " Edward continued . " The ravine 's the cause of the trouble  --  or the stream that made it . When Sir John damned the stream to make the lake , Stafford was left only a trickle . It 's been a bone of contention between the families for years . " " Could the law not settle the dispute ? " asked Matthew as the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little trickle of water at the bottom of the ravine . " The law could if it would , " said Edward . " But the lawyers have been wrangling forever , with little hope of a resolution satisfying to either party . " " Then Sir John did have enemies  --  the Staffords  --  contrary to common report , " Matthew said . " Report ? " exclaimed Edward , vehemently . " Report is a most vile slanderer of good men and resolute defender of hypocrites . So say I of report . In fact , Sir John was not well liked in the neighborhood . The gentry found him cold and contemptuous of them because his blood was old Saxon blood and theirs was n't . The common rout feared him with a superstitious dread . He was a hardvisagedman , you know . Some without tact would have called him ugly as sin . " Matthew was about to ask more about this fear of the baronet when his attention was drawn to two horsemen approaching them at a fast gallop . " That 's Stafford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand in salute . Stafford and his servant reined their horses in and came forward slowly . Stafford was a stout man of about thirty-five with a square face and shaggy brows and beard . His servant was a rawboned fellow in a buff jerkin and big boots . He had close-set eyes , a sharp nose , and long jaw . " Wide of your master 's property , are you not ? " Stafford saidp94after introductions had been made . " My line commences at the ravine . " " Well I know , sir , " said Edward . " Our new steward wanted to pay his respects . " " Oh , did he ? " asked Stafford , regarding Matthew with a contemptuous expression . " I thought this person in your company was certainly a lawyer by his suit , come to serve some document or writ . " " I am the steward at Thorncombe , " Matthew reiterated . " A new steward ? Well then , has Cuth Fludd gone to heaven ? " " Cuth lives and in reasonably good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am appointed by the new mistress , " Matthew inserted . " Oh yes , Mistress Frances , " Stafford said , " a winsome child , if I remember her right . I do get to London now and again , although my present appearance may mark me a country squire and no more . How came you to have been appointed at such a distance ? Could not your mistress have found some competent fellow in the neighborhood , or is that beneath the proud Challoners ? " " Undoubtedly there were those in Derbyshire who were qualified  --  more qualified than I  --  but it was hardly my place to question my mistress 's choice , only to serve as directed . My wife accompanied me and is the new housekeeper . " Stafford nodded and scratched his beard . He looked at his servant and then back at Matthew . " You 're a married man , are you ? You have the look . " " By which remark , I presume , sir , that you are not married , " Matthew said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is a Mistress Stafford . Is n't there , Wylkin ? " Stafford hoisted himself in his saddle and addressed this question to his servant , whose hard eyes remained fixed on Matthew . " There is a Mistress Stafford , my master 's wife , " Wylkin said flatly . Matthew gathered from this exchange that there was something about Mistress Stafford that created tension between master and servant , but at the moment he was more concerned to hold his own with Stafford than speculate about the man 's domestic infelicities , if that was what they were.  | " I do n't speak by way of criticism , " Stafford said , " but commiseration . Undoubtedly , your companion will satisfy your curiosity on your way back to the castle , servants being what they are . Is n't that right , Bastian ? You will fill this good man 's ears with gossip , wo n't you  --  as soon as my back is turned ? " Matthew looked at Edward to see how he was taking this obvious provocation and was gratified to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman , despite the great gulf in their stations in life . " You accuse me unjustly , Master Stafford , " Edward replied calmly . " The affairs of Stafford Hall are none of my business , and therefore I make them no part of my conversation  --  with fellow servants or with my masters . " " Why , you 're a true pillar of virtue , are n't you , Bastian ? " Stafford said with heavy irony . " Wylkin , give Edward Bastian a coin or two from your purse to reward him for his virtue . It 's the least we can do to advance the cause of discretion in the world . " Smirking , Wylkin reached into his belt and found his purse . He brought forth a penny and flung it into the dirt . Edward did n't look at the coin . " Pick it up , Bastian , like a good fellow . It 's your reward . Why wait for heaven ? " Wylkin said , " Go ahead , Edward . Do n't be shy . We well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a vicious gibe , and Matthew noticed the hostler 's face go livid with suppressed rage . Stafford saw it too , and the response his servant 's words had provoked prodded him to even greater injury . " I said , " Stafford repeated slowly and emphatically , " pick up the penny like a good faithful dog . " It was a calculated insult , designed to humiliate Edward before Matthew 's eyes . Matthew felt embarrassed for the hostler and angry at Stafford for the insult , which was an insult to him as well . In all this time Edward refused to budge , nor did he even look at the ground . He stared at Stafford with open hostility . The silence lengthened and grew pregnant with impending violence . Of the four men , only Wylkin was armed . He wore a knife of a good eight inches at his belt . But if menacing looks could kill , the field would have been a slaughterhouse . Realizing the danger of the moment , Matthew dismounted and picked up the penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your alms , perhaps there 's poor in the parish who will bless you for your charity , " he said , looking up at Stafford . Then he remounted and said , " Come , Edward . We 've kept Master Stafford and his man too long in the sun . We still have something to see of Thorncombe before the day 's done . " Matthew 's gesture apparently so surprised Stafford that the man could find no quick response , although it was evident from his glare that his hostility had shifted from the hostler to Matthew . Matthew turned his horse and headed back the way they had come . He did not look behind to see if Edward followed . He prayed he would ; Matthew wanted no violent confrontation . The exchange of words had been sharp enough . Matthew was relieved when in a few moments he heard Edward hurrying to catch up . In the greater distance he heard Stafford 's voice . " Do n't cross me , Stock . No inhabitant of Thorncombeis friend to Thomas Stafford . Take care where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ravine and settled into Matthew 's heart . He rode on as though he had n't heard , nor was he willing to give Stafford the satisfaction . Edward came up alongside . " Devils incarnate the both . Would to God I had been armed . " " Thanks to God you were not , " Matthew said . " Wylkin looks the sort who would kill his own mother . " " He doubtless did . And Stafford 's another . " They crossed the bridge and Matthew felt relieved to be on Challoner land again . They rode on in a strained silence for about two miles , passing the barrow and coming to the first of the tenants ' cottages , where the tenants ' children came out to watch them pass . Matthew waved . The children waved hack . Edward seemed to have settled into a black mood . To ease it , Matthew asked him about Stafford 's wife . A smile spread slowly on the hostler 's face at the question . He laughed bitterly and said , " Since I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well earn my reputation . The truth is that Stafford and his wife are ever at each other 's throats . And rumor has it that she 's cuckolded him with Wylkin . " " Ha ! " said Matthew . " Wylkin has the look . It 's a rare villainp97that does not show it in his face . It 's a wonder that Stafford does n't kill Wylkin , or at least send him packing . " " Well , " said Edward , " possibly the gossip is false . Or perhaps Stafford finds Wylkin too useful to discharge or murder . " " In either case , I do not like the man , " Matthew declared . " Nor his master . " " Stafford is hardly worth a curse , " said Edward with even greater bitterness , " though he be a gentleman born and bred and own a fine house and tell his servants where to go and when . " When she could no longer hear the voices , she stepped out from behind the cerecloth where she had concealed herself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a start Edward had given her with his madcap arrival , bursting into the cottage of such suddenness that she had nearly dropped her child , who had cried out in alarm . Edward had told her she must hide herself and the baby , too , and she had done as she was told . She had stood as mum as death behind the cloth , clutching the child to her breast protectivelyand praying that it would not betray them . Eventually , inevitably since it had capacity for fear but not prudence , the child , alarmed by the dog 's furor , had betrayed their presence , but by then Edward and the steward were gone . Edward 's father was still seated on his stool , watching the fire intently as though something of great pith and moment were being enacted in the conflagration of faggots and small branches . Then he swiveled toward her , his mouth agape and his eyes pale and lusterless as a dead man 's . The movement frightened her a little by its suddenness , yet she knew the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infancy and awaiting ultimate dissolution in a half-life between dream and sleep . She felt an aching pity for him , and for herself , and for her child . Indeed , she pitied the whole human race at that moment , fated as it was to follow such a torturous course . The child began to cry , declaring its need for nourishment , and she quickly unfastened her bodice and pressed her nipple into the child 's mouth , feeling , as always when she gazed upon the little face , an intolerable burden of grief , in which despair , love , andp98resentment at fate were perniciously mixed . " It 's all right now , " she said , in her heart not sure that it was . " The strange man 's gone . " As though in response to her words , a heavy sigh from the old man  --  like an amen from fellow worshipers  --  seemed to agree with her somber reflections . Then he grinned a toothless grin , as though her words had somehow been meant for him as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself and for her child  --  without quite knowing why.  |p99Stafford  and Wylkin had ridden a half mile toward Stafford Hall when the stout gentleman pulled up on his horse and signaled to his servant he should do likewise . Both men were overtaken by a cloud of gagging dust . Stafford said , " This Matthew Stock may be only the steward , but he 's no fool . His plain , simple mug 's a guise for mischief , mark me . " Stafford stroked his beard in the way of those whose thoughts are running well ahead of their words . He eyed his servant narrowly , waiting for a response . " A guise , sir ? " asked Wylkin , not slow to follow but curious to hear Stafford 's opinion of the steward . The horses had been made nervous by the sound of human voices raised in anger ; they kept stomping and shifting as the men talked . Stafford said , " It 's as certain as death that Stock 's appointment means the young heiress intends to stick her long nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might , " said Wylkin . " Now that she 's mistress . " Stafford glanced sideways toward the ravine and bridge , thenlooked back at Wylkin . " I do n't mean into those matters that shouldnaturally concern her , but rather those that concern me . " " Do you think she 's suspicious about her uncle 's death ? "  | " Why should n't she be  --  if she knows the facts and her noggin is more than a prop for her golden locks , " said Stafford . " Of course there 's a chance she does n't care one way or the other . A rich uncle dead is better than a poor one living . If you 're his heir , which she is . For all I know , she may have hired someone to drown him . Stranger things have happened , although few are spoken of in church . How much love could she have for a bachelor uncle she knew largely by his letters , which could n't have been very frequent ? What worries me is that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You mean  --  " Stafford nodded . " She might know , or at least suspect , and have sent Stock and his wife as spies to discover that her uncle fetched more treasure home from Ireland than an occasional wench for his lust 's sake . " " What shall be done then ? " Wylkin asked eagerly , for the manservant had a colorful past as a soldier and highwayman and was ever ready for employment . " A very good question , Jack  --  and quickly answered . Hie you over to the castle and have words with that confederate of yours . Make her a party to our plans only in so far as to make her companion of your watch of the Stocks . If the new steward appears to be a spy as I suspect , we 'll rid ourselves of him straightway . " " So he wo n't be any trouble to us , " said Wylkin , drawing his finger across his throat to suggest the method of Matthew Stock 's disposal . " Oh , you are passing eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached over and placed a hand on the pommel of Wylkin 's knife . " If it comes to that , you 'll have your orders . An obvious murder would only confirm what doubt already exists about Sir John 's drowning . Be subtle , therefore . I know you have it in your heart to be so . Scare him off , if you can . We 'll kill him if we must . " " And what of the Irishman ? " " Conroy 's a stone in my shoe . Continue to watch him . It is unthinkable that he was n't privy to his master 's secret . Why else would he remain at Thorncombe , Sir John dead ? Quickly , now , about your work . "  |p101Stafford  watched as Wylkin galloped off , feeling a surge of satisfaction . Wylkin pleased him at the moment , for the man was totally unscrupulous and fearless  --  qualities in which Stafford , for all his bravado , knew he was deficient . Not that he pursued his present intrigue with any reluctance . His long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was like a raw and open cancer . Any treachery seemed justified . And if the law 's delay continued to deprive him of a free-flowing stream , he could at least enjoy the Irish booty he believed on good report and reasonable surmise was concealed somewhere at Thorncombe . When he had heard the news of his old enemy 's death , Stafford had been much gratified . He had also been hopeful that it might be his opportunity to secure the estate for himself . For why should the young slip of a girl want to worry herself about the gloomy pile of the old castle and the troubles that went with tenants when she could continue to enjoy the social delights of the metropolis ? He had envisioned himself as master of Thorncombe  --  at leisure to dig for treasure in perfect privacy . But the assignment of the new steward suggested that his vision was not to be fulfilled . With respect to his treasure-digging , his wife had suggested he turn informer and receive the thanks and reward of the Queen . The trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stomach in it  --  was that it would have been too easy for the living Sir John to deny his wrongdoing . And not much more difficult for Frances Challoner to deny it on her deceased uncle 's behalf . Was Sir John not an honorable soldier of well-allowed reputation ? Without satisfactory proof  --  and what proof was satisfactory other than the hoard itself ?  --  his accusation would appear the grossest slander and fall upon his own head . And thus his present intent to work by stealth and subversion until such an hour as the gold was found and in hand . But this purpose was made more difficult of fulfillment because of Stock  --  and also because of Conroy . For if Sir John had been murdered , as Stafford devoutly suspected , he believed the motive was the treasure . Which meant , to Stafford 's way of thinking , that someone else in the neighborhood was capable of deviousness and violence , knew of the Challoner hoard , and was as bound and determined as he to have it.  |p102But  as much as Stafford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hope that he would be the first to the gold and receive , at long last , just compensation for the numerous injuries he and his family had suffered from the arrogance and pride of the Challoner . Sometimes at night he would wake in a cold , quicksilver sweat and fear that it was all a dream , this Irish hoard of Thorncombe . His wife , at such times , more sanguine than he , assured him that his fears were the work of too much meat the night before , or of the damned spirit of melancholy that afflicts the soul between midnight and dawn , or , of a sickly irresolution and close cousin to cowardice . To bolster his confidence and prick him on , husband and wife would pass the time speculating about the treasure  --  both as to quality and to quantity . Stafford would imagine a half-dozen chests or more , brimming with silver plate and cup , thousands of gold sovereigns , and twenty thousand coins of inferior denomination . His wife imagined jewels  --  emeralds , rubies , diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses and other religious relics , each worth a prince 's ransom , and God only knew what other fine stuff snatched from the barbarous hands of Irish Catholics and brought to the Protestant haven of Thorncombe to be ensconced there , dedicated to the private use of a soldier of good repufe . And in such mutual recitals , the Staffords nourished their hopes , and Thomas Stafford 's mind to larceny became as razor sharp as his manservant 's knife.  |p103Una  's ignorance of the Queen 's English did not prevent her from expressing her unease about being left to guard the locked door . As a concession , Joan promised to make haste in securing a key . She would find Moll , she thought . Surely the cranky old woman had kept an extra set . She rushed down the stairs at great risk to life and limb , tore through the kitchen , and covered the greensward like a dog chasing a rat , despite her tight bodice and flapping farthingale and other female garb made to shackle a fleet foot . As she approached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discord . She knocked ; the wrangling ceased , and Moll 's face appeared . " Mistress Stock ? It 's you , is it ? Rumor had you sick unto death . You seem well enough now , though sweating like a horse . " Joan ignored the rudeness of this salutation . It was clear that her visit had interrupted a debate of some magnitude and that her appearance on the scene was offensive in being an interruption and in being a call where she was not wanted . Moll 's face was a veritable map of conflicting passions and discontents . Although it was late in the morning , she was still dressed in an ungirdled nightgown and her feet were bare . Capless , her steel-gray hair was a fright . Behind the old woman , her husband 's mumbling could be heard . The lastp104word for once , Joan supposed , in whatever issue had ignited such hot debate . Joan explained her need coolly . She was still out of breath from her race , but exerted herself to maintain control . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no lock , " Moll said . " It has a lock . There 's someone inside ! " " Someone inside ? Well , demand that he come forth  --  that 's the way to do it . Do n't trouble me about keys . I gave you all I had . " " If he had come forth at my beckoning , I would not have risked my life to come to you for a key , " Joan responded crossly . " I ca n't believe there are no keys to these rooms . " " Believe what you like , dispute the rest , " Moll said , thrusting her face forward aggressively . " I gave what keys I had , and that 's that . Besides , why would you want admittance to the room anyway ? It has n't been used for years . If there 's anything there , it 's old foul trash from before the Flood . " " Why I want to enter is no concern of yours , " Joan returned sharply . " It is sufficient that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . " " No one disputes your right , " Moll shot back with equal vehemence . " Such a right I enjoyed for forty years . Yet I can not give over what I never had . I have not set eyes on the insides of the White Keep since our late master 's brother went off to Ireland and never came home again . If you want in , you must break down the door . " " And so I shall if I must , " Joan said . " Then for Jesus ' sake do what you must , " said Moll . " And let us be . The care of the castle is no longer my concern . Good day to you . " Moll slammed the door shut in Joan 's face , leaving her quivering with rage . Joan said something found more often on the lips of London alewives than her own and stamped her foot in irritation . She had come to Thorncombe to discover a murderer ; now she was n't sure she would n't do murder herself before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she prayed God would forgive the thought even as He understood the justness of her rage.  |p105She  turned and marched toward the stable to find Edward and an ax , determined that the door to the locked room should fall , if not by key , then by main force . She was halfway to her destination , feeling the resurgent fever in her cheeks , when she remembered that Edward would be with Matthew . For a moment she saw the pair in her mind 's eye . Horseback . Riding down a quiet road . Coming to a tenant 's tidy cottage . Receiving a gracious welcome from humble folk . She stopped to catch her breath . No , Edward would not be there when she needed him , nor would Matthew . A very fine day it was turning out to be , she thought with disgust . She would be lucky if she did n't fall ill again . Then she remembered Una , who would be maintaining her solitary and frightening vigil outside the locked door , and began to feel both fear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her prisoner ? She gathered her skirts and rushed back to the house , climbed the stairs , and found Una . The Irishwoman showed no sign of distress . By Una 's gesture and very broken English , Joan determined that no one had escaped the room during her absence , but that neither had Una heard any more noises . Joan tried knocking again and commanding , but these efforts were no more successful than before and she began to feel very foolish . Was it possible there was no one within at all ? Or could it have been a rat she heard ? Concluding there was no more to be done  --  at least for now  --  she thanked Una for her company , and the two women went back to the kitchen . It was all nearly too much for Joan  --  the frustration of dealing with these folks of alien speech , the locked doors , the recalcitrant , impudent servants such as Moll Fludd . She decided to go out-of-doors again , but to walk , not run . The sun was high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the woods she could hear the twitter of birds . Restless with confinement in the castle and still fuming over her injured dignity , Joan set her course for the woods , where she hoped to find nothing more offensive than a thornbush or anthill . She needed to collect herself , to regain the control lost in these broils with Moll and Conroy . The woods were deep and serene and she longed to escape the grim walls of Thorncombe.  |p106The  trees of the wood grew in such closeness as to make almost a wall of greenery except where paths had been made , and even these were narrow and enclosed with bramble and fern . She followed one path that took her toward the lake and in no time she stood upon its shore , contemplating the broad expanse and the little humpbacked island at its center . She had smelled the fetid water almost before it came into view . She looked up at the sky . A cloud drew itself across the noontime sun . A flock of high-flying birds headed south . Beyond the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Keep . They were only hills now , nothing more . She looked at the island . It was like an enormous turtle with only its shell above water . And on its back , a risky purchase , was a stone replica of one of Thorncombe 's ancient towers . She wondered who had built the tower and why . She scanned the shoreline before her . Sedge grew to the water 's line and possibly went beyond it  --  except in one place , where a pebble-strewn stretch would have afforded a landing . Knowing it must he the place where Sir John had been found , she pulled up her skirts and made her way down the hank . A cloud of buzzing insects followed her , but she beat them away , determined not to retreat until she had seen all there was to see . The peace she had sought in the verdant wood could wait . For the moment she was driven by an intense curiosity to examine the place where murder had occurred , even though she thought it very unlikely she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of the little beach and looked again over the water . The cloud had passed and the sun shone clearly as before . The lake now seemed neither sinister nor treacherous . She reviewed the facts of the baronet 's death , imagining how this same scene must have looked in a heavy rain and where the shallop must have been . She came to no conclusions and was somewhat depressed by the seemingly complete absence of any sign whatsoeverthat anything of note had occurred on the spot . It was not as though she expected the murderer to have returned to the scene , or that a monument should be raised to the event . But even the shallop was gone , and no footprints other than her own were evident where she trod . Never had she felt with suchp107force the absolute indifference of the natural world to human tragedy . Deciding there was nothing more to see , she started back the way she had come and had gone a little way when her shoe became stuck in the mud . She bent over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell upon her knees in the midst of a clump of grass . As she was struggling to regain solid footing she noticed an object at a little distance that by its sharp right angle and color did not belong there . Curious , she forgot about her muddy shoe and skirts and moved with difficulty toward it . Then she bent over and brought it up from where it was half-submerged . It was a brass-bound chest of middle size and very well made but filthy with mud . She dragged it from the sedge to firmer ground , Kneeling , she opened it and saw that the chest was empty except fot a little brackish water at the bottom and a large black beetle swimming desperately therein . She tipped the chest onto its side , liberating the beetle , then contemplated her find in more careful detail . She reasoned the chest was too artfully wrought and sound of construction to have been discarded wantonly . Nor did it seem to have been deliberately concealed where she had found it , halfburiedin water and mud . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the chest 's having been found empty . Which left the question : How did the chest come to be where it was ? And how long had it lain there ? As to the second question , Joan found it impossible to say . The wood showed signs of deterioration and the brass was badly ' tarnished . Given its exposure to water , rain , and sun , it might have been half-submerged for a month , or perhaps a year . She thought it unlikely that it had been exposed to the elements for a longerduration . She was thus able to associate her discovery in time at is least with the death of Sir John Challoner . The question of how the chest came to be where it was required even more desperate conjecture . She speculated , however , that the chest might have been discarded in the lake and drifted ashore like an abandoned vessel . Empty of heavy contents , the chest would have been buoyant . Once it had undoubtedly contained something of value . But what ? She felt around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets of rosewood had begun to warp . As she did so , she was suddenly seized by a melancholy of such profundity that further examination of the chest was impossible . Her vision blurred , and she seemed to sink into a moist , hideous darkness . She felt there was water all around her , above and below ; and all along her nether parts she felt the grip of ruthless hands pulling her deeper into the watery abyss . She would have screamed but she had no breath . She tried to struggle but she found herself paralyzed , her body a rebel to her brain . More agonizing to her than the thought of imminent suffocation was the horror she felt of the water itself . For somehow she knew all that element was alive with slimy , eyeless creatures with soft , gaping mouths  --  sucking and writhing . She knew she was about to die , and yet she could not utter a prayer . Then the vision passed as suddenly as it had come , and she found herself as before , on dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart pounding . Looking out over the torpid water , she felt a seizure of dread . In her mouth was the foul taste of the lake water . Her head swam with nausea . Fearing she would lose consciousness again , she got herself into a sitting position , her legs folded beneath her . She covered her eyes with her hands and she kneaded the insides of her cheeks to make spittle . She spat over and over in an effort to get rid of the horrible taste . She was sweating terribly too ; the front of her gown , filthy from her fall , clung to her . She took a handkerchief from her waist and wiped her face and neck . Joan realized what had happened but not why . She knew the darkness that had enveloped her had been one of her glimmerings , triggered by her contact with the chest . She had had such experiencesall of her life  --  strange , often prophetic seizures wherein not only the vision but the sensation of peril was opened to her . Sometimes her glimmerings would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed a half-day to recover . Not in her power to evoke , nor to deny , they came when they would . Ignorant of any scriptural warrant for such experiences , Joan still trusted they were not of the devil . Her husband , tolerant and optimistic in such matters , assured her they were from heaven , although he professedp109not to be so great a theologian that he could square them with the teaching of Christians . Matthew had learned to respect her glimmerings , to accept their reality  --  and their authority . Now it was clear to Joan that she had just had a vision of death . Was it a premonition of a death to come , or a confirmation of murder done ? For the next hour or more , Joan sat motionless . She could not bring herself to look at the chest she had found , much less touch it again . It was dusk before Joan 's strength returned and she began to consider the urgency of returning to the castle . She would have no difficulty explaining the condition of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth would serve  --  that she had gone abroad to take the air , stumbled , fallen , injured herself and sullied the gown . Of her discovery of the chest and the attendant vision she resolved to say nothing , except to Matthew . She managed to stand . Her legs were numb from the awkward position in which she had been sitting at such length . She moved along the path carefully and entered the wood , picking up her stride now that the lake was behind her , her thoughts full of Matthew and what he might say of her experiences . A sudden awareness that she was not alone amid the gloomy trees brought her to a halt . Ahead she saw a figure moving across her path . The familiar white cap and apron told her it was one of the castle 's female servants . Joan could not imagine what would bring a servant into the woods at such an hour and became at once suspicious . She decided to follow . She stayed far enough behind to keep her own pursuit a secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joan 's curiosity grew stronger ; she had forgotten about her vision now , caught up in a more soluble mystery . Then ahead , she saw another figure come out from behind a tree and she quickly concealed herself . She realized now it was a lovers ' tryst she witnessed , for there was a man and a woman meeting secretly , a quick embrace , an exchange of words she could not hear . More curious than ever , Joanp110crept closer , and when she was within twenty feet and dared not venture nearer , she stopped and listened . The man spoke English and so did the woman , although the woman 's English was imprinted with a strong Irish accent . As yet , Joan could not see the woman 's face , but she could see the man . He was tall , in his late thirties or older perhaps , with a sinewy body , hawklike face , and cruel , sensual mouth . Then the woman turned and Joan saw that it was Una . It was not what a man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan , but Una 's deception . Una had spoken English  --  and been understood ! But all along she had made Joan think otherwise . Joan felt an anger within her , felt betrayed  --  betrayed as she had felt when , coming into the gallery earlier that day , she had found Conroy and Una conversing conspiratorily in their native language . Joan listened . Yes , it was English for a fact , for from time to time a familiar word or phrase would carry across the middle distance between them and her . She watched , fascinated but puzzled by the deception she had uncovered . The man swept the cap from Una 's head and the long , dark hair of the Irishwoman tumbled down her back . With spreading smile along the cruel mouth , he slipped her bodice from her upper body with a deftness of one removing a glove and began to caress her , moving his hands swiftly and lightly over her breasts . Then they both lay down and Joan could only hear the woman 's laughter and then the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a quarter of an hour . Joan was deeply embarrassed and ashamed of her role as witness to these amorous proceedings . She did not feel comfortable as a spy , despite her royal license , and never so uncomfortable as now , hidden and gaping at another woman 's pleasure like a dogfacedwench who never hopes to enjoy the same herself . She would have slunk off and left the lovers to their pleasures had she not been so outraged by Una 's pretense  --  and as a consequence so convinced that what she was observing was not merely a backstairs alliance but a conspiracy that it was her duty to fathom . Was it not reasonable to assume that this same conspiracy involved , in some sinister way , the deaths of Sir John and Aileen Mogaill ?  |p111Listening  , Joan heard the voices come again , muted and intimate in the dusk . The two stood ; Una dressed , the man barechested . Joan heard their farewells , saw them embrace again and kiss . Then Joan realized Una 's departure would bring her close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bush that had been her hiding place . She heard the steps come very near and a crackle of dried leaves underfoot and a twig broken in passage . Una seemed to stop for a moment before continuing . Joan held her breath and waited , fearful of discovery . After a few moments , to her relief , she heard Una singing at a greater distance . It was an Irish song Una sung , low and plaintive and very beautiful in the gathering gloom . Joan waited until she could no longer hear the strains , then she looked up and saw that Una 's lover had disappeared too.  |p112Jack  Wylkin thought Una was a little long in the tooth for one of his inches . She must have been very near his own age by his reckoning , and he had been baptized a Christian soul thirty-six years ago that very month . He knew this for a fact because he had seen the register wherein the event was recorded , and the clerk had pointed out the name ; thus Wylkin knew his own age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . Also , she was an unmarried female , whereas he much preferred the conquest of married women , so as to experience the gratification of cuckolding the husbands . On the other hand , he reflected generously , Una 's broad beam and bountiful bosoms pleased him , not being the sort of man averse to a little extra flesh about the bone . Her skin was satin-smooth and white , her eye wanton as he might wish . She was diffident , peevish , and her Irish brogue irritated him , but the truth was he enjoyed her body , her unrestrained passion , her moans of pleasure , and certain tricks of lovemaking that a Parisian courtesan might have envied . In sum , he might have been sneaking over to Thorncombe to enjoy her even if she had not provided him with information by which he aimed to make himself very rich . In return for this information and subsequent reports of the goings-on at the castle , Wylkin had promised to marry Una . It hadp113been an easy promise to make . The wedded state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark or a clap of thunder . That she believed in his promises he approved ; and he approved as well that they slipped so easily and readily from his lips . Wylkin was born without a conscience , as some men are born without arms and legs . Moreover , he was a confirmed disciple of Machiavelli , whose doctrine he knew by common report , Wylkin himself being unable to read or write . Una did not know where Sir John 's treasure was concealed , only that it was concealed , and that it was Catholic wealth appropriated in the Queen 's name , but neither delivered to its royal owner nor reported to her . " Is it in the house , do you think ? " Wylkin had asked Una for the hundredth time . But as often as he asked , she shook her head doubtfully . Had she not looked , at every opportunity , in those rooms of Thorncombeto which she had access ? Had she not even pried behind the wainscoting in the master 's chamber ? Had she not made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than she ? She had told him nothing of treasure ; he had mentioned nothing to her . But she believed he knew , and had told Wylkin what she suspected . " It 's buried , then ? " he prompted her . " Perhaps , buried . " " A barrowful of rich treasure . " The thought pleasing him , he squeezed her affectionately and promised her a rich jewel when the treasure was his . " Then you will marry me , " she said . " Then I will marry you , " he replied . More than once he thought of forcing an answer out of her , for he was skillful in that art , but he liked her too much for that . And he was pretty convinced that her ignorance of the booty 's whereaboutswas unfeigned . What Una did know and had conveyed to Wylkin consisted of gossip , conjecture , and just enough personal observation to make the story credible to one whose greed disposed him to believe . Ironically , her story had slipped out by a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had commented idly that it was a poor house that must subsist on a soldier 's pay , referring top114what he supposed was Sir John 's modest income as a commander . Whereupon Una had said , " But surely , Sir John is a very rich gentleman indeed . " She thought , in her simplicity , that everyone knew . How Sir John Challoner had burned churches and houses of the Catholic gentry , sparing only those willing to ransom their lives and property with hard cash , jewelry , or plate . How he had accumulated a small fortune by these methods and brought it home to Thorncombe , where it supposedly had been stuffed in some secret place . In Ireland , Una had been a servant in a house spared only by a bribe of several hundred pounds and thus had firsthand knowledge . But everyone had not known , and as Wylkin had explored her story he realized she knew what Sir John Challoner had been at great pains to keep concealed . And for good reason . The Queen had little patience with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fifteen years since Sir John had brought Una from Ireland to serve in his house . Her people in Ireland all dead , she had been alone and desperate , and although she had been warned by a priest to beware the charity of the English , and accused by the same priest of betraying her own people and , yes , the Holy Faith as well , she 'd gone with Sir John . She felt no loyalty to her native ground , nor to the Church . She believed a religion that would let her suffer could hardly demand her allegiance . And so she 'd come to Thorncombe , had progressed in time from scullion to cook , and had lasted out a dozen of her countrywomen of less adaptability also brought to the castle by Sir John . She wanted now the dignity of marriage , having indulged in any number of random couplings since the age of twelve . And , of course , she wanted a share of the treasure . All of this was Una 's story , as Wylkin understood it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his employer , for although he would have liked to discover the treasure himself and keep it all , he realized that a treasure of that magnitude would have to be judiciously spent . For nothing was more likely to get a poor man hanged than a sudden and unaccountable display of wealth . And thus his absolute need for Stafford . Stafford already had wealthp115and power , and Wylkin could not imagine advancement , no matter how bountifully financed , save on the skirts of some great man . Wylkin was content therefore to be a hireling . To work for a generous percentage of the gross , even though he knew that without the intelligence he had provided Stafford , the gentleman would have remained as ignorant as a babe of his neighbor 's booty , which , if it was all Una claimed , would keep Wylkin in good wine and fine linen forever . Now Wylkin 's hard , calculating grin remained frozen as he watched the Irishwoman disappear among the trees . He put on his shirt and his jerkin and his hat and started walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still grinning , despite the dark , for he had an overpowering feeling of being very close to what he sought . Una made haste to return to the castle but was not so preoccupied with the fresh memory of her lover 's embrace that she did not catch the movement at the corner of her eye , and , pausing briefly , saw the patch of cloth she recognized as the new housekeeper 's . Reasoning that where the cloth was the gown was , and where the gown , the wearer thereof , she knew she was being spied upon . Her heart raced ; she expected the Stock woman to rise from her place of concealment and denounce both her and Wylkin . For surely Joan Stock had seen . And heard ? That was another question . One with even more dangerous implications . To be caught playing the harlot under the castle walls was one thing ; to be discovered as a betrayer of the house with the servant of Thorncombe 's greatest enemy was quite another . But when Una heard no shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly concluded that for some reason the new housekeeper did not wish herself to be seen . Puzzled , Una resumed her way , trying to act as though she were as unaware of having been observed . She began to sing to give color to her deception , and she kept singing until she was clear of the woods and halfway to the kitchen porch . She had agreed to meet Wylkin again . She resolved to ask him then what he supposed the Englishwoman 's spying meant.  |p116It  was fully dark by the time Joan returned to the castle . With fear for her safety mitigated only by her eagerness to tell Matthew of her discoveries , she dashed across the cobbled courtyard and burst into the kitchen , where she found Matthew and Edward at table and Una nowhere to be seen . Matthew thanked God that she had returned and was in the middle of questioning her as to where she had been and why , when Joan , eager not to be too direct before Edward , asked the hostler if he had a sturdy ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A door to be breached ? " Edward asked good-humoredly when Joan had made her needs more explicit . " Does not Moll have the key ? " Joan explained that it was Moll herself who had suggested this method of entry . Edward scratched his head and said he would do anything within his power to please and , as soon as his back was turned , Joan by sign and whisper made Matthew understand that she had much more to tell if he would be patient until they were alone , for in the meantime Una had returned and was busying herself as though nothing had happened that concerned her . Then , when Edward returned with his ax , the three set out for the White Keep.  | " There 's a thing  --  someone  --  behind the door , but no mouse stirring nor another cat , " she explained as they climbed the stairs . When they reached the chamber , they found the door ajar . All stood there looking at it , wondering what that meant . Matthew stepped forward and nudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern and held it forward to illuminate the interior . Confused and mortified , Joan said behind him , " Oh , for heaven 's sake . " " There 's no one here now , " Matthew said . A few furnishings  --  asmall bed with canopy , very dusty even in the candlelight . A delight of spiders . A chest , which proved empty upon inspection , several battered chairs with curved backs , cold stone floors . Walls bare of adornment . " There was someone here , " Joan insisted . " I heard a stirring within . So did Una . " The thought of the Irishwoman brought back the recent discovery of her treachery and she twinged at the image , felt a flush of embarrassment . How the woman had made a fool of them both ! She was eager to tell Matthew but could say nothing with Edward standing there , looking very useless and foolish himself , holding the great ax . " And you 're sure the room was locked before ? " Matthew asked , turning to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I believe you without the oath , " Matthew said reassuringly . " Yet there 's no sign of occupancy  --  not in twenty years . " Nor would there be , Joan thought in dismay . At least Matthewbelieved her . That was something . In their new quarters , deemed as suitable by Matthew as by Joan , she shut the door firmly behind her and said , " I have much to say , husband , but could not speak before . " " I have much to tell you , too , but forebore speaking for the same reason . Joan quickly recounted her tour of the castle , her confrontation with Conroy , and her suspicion that he was up to no good . Not content to give over her opinion that someone had been concealedp118in the White Keep earlier that day , she ventured to say that it was Conroy . " A very sneaky sort , " she said . " But why should he have been lurking within ? " Matthew asked . " God knows , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be above him . He 's full of resentment because I ordered him from the house to the stables . Perhaps he wanted to give two silly women a fright , although he seems to be friends with Una and she was as unnerved as I , if not more so . " " He may be trying to scare us off , " Matthew suggested . " Making capital of the old stories about the Black Keep . Perhaps he 's heard about Aileen Mogaill  --  perhaps he killed her himself . Perhaps she found him prowling and he took her head for the cause . " Oh , a goodly cause for homicide , " Joan said . But Joan left behind the Irishman 's behavior to proceed to greater news , not in the order in which the event occurred but in order of its importance in her mind . She told him what she had seen in the woods . Matthew had no trouble identifying Una 's hawk-faced lover as Stafford 's manservant , Wylkin . " There can be no two faces so alike . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him no satisfaction beyond the assurance it was English spoken rather than some other tongue . Of that she was sure . " So Una understands English after all , " Matthew said , shaking his head in wonderment . " That 's a new fact to be reckoned with . " " She made fools of us , " Joan said bitterly . " Moll , too , for surely the horrid woman knew all along . It was she who told us Una could not speak . " " What must we have uttered in her presence , then ! " Matthew said , shaking his head , pinching his chin with thumb and forefinger . But she had already considered that . She was positive they had not spoken of their secret mission except in privacy , as now . Perhaps the cook 's deception had failed of its intent then . " At least we 've been warned . Henceforth forearmed . " " Against Una and Moll , " said Matthew . " But did Wylkin see you in the woods ? There 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joan said , hurt a little at the suggestion she should be so maladroit a spy . " A naked savage stealing on his prey could not have been more circumspect . I crouched down low in the ferns and thorns . On my haunches . Wylkin saw nothing , and Una passed by unawares and singing upon her return to the house . I waited then until I was sure both were gone completely . " " Thank God , " Matthew said . " Had Wylkin seen you crouched there , who knows what he would have done . Edward speaks very ill of him . " Then she told him about her visit to the lake . She had saved this for last , for she regarded both her glimmering and the chest that had provoked it the first of their clues to Sir John 's drowning . Matthew listened to her story without interrupting . When she had finished he put a sympathetic hand on her hand and said , " A terrible vision , indeed ! " Then he wanted to know all about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its quality and all the details of its construction that Joan had only half noticed . " What , " she exclaimed in exasperation . " Am I a carpenter that I should observe these things ? It was a chest , a plain wooden chest , such as might store clothing . " " Well , it might be a clue , " Matthew conceded . But she protested his weaseling might be . " Of course it 's a clue . Anyone can see that ! In the first place , it was no chest for casual discarding . Who but a fool would throw away a chest so fine ? In the second , it was not hidden where I found it but half-submerged  --  an incompetent concealment if there ever was one . I 'll wager it floated ashore and foundered like a vessel at low tide . Only it was deep in the sedge , very deep . Seeing it was a stroke of luck . But oh , Matthew , such a midnight melancholy seized me when I touched the thing  --  and a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about me and loathsome creatures gaping and sucking . " She shuddered at the recollection , and seeing how distressed she was , Matthew put his arm around her shoulders and drew her forehead against his cheek . Her skin was cool ; he could feel her trembling . He asked her what she thought her vision meant and she shook her head , puzzled . She was almost afraid to speculate . But she saidp120she was sure the chest meant something , was connected to the baronet 's death , and perhaps with Aileen Mogaill 's , too . Her certainty seemed to settle the matter , and Matthew admitted the empty chest into his inventory of clues , as small an inventory as it was . He had too much respect for his wife 's intuitions and visions to contest her interpretation . Partly to distract her from her gloomy memories , he told her about his visit to the wretched tenant farms , about his meeting with Stafford and Wylkin , repeating all that was on either side as best he could recall it . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Bastian cottage . And about the fire that had been laid shortly before his arrival , but not by the old man , who , Matthew was convinced , would have been incapable of it . Joan agreed it was very suspicious . " A child in the cottage , whose existence Edward denies . Could it have been a mewing cat you heard ? Or a squealing pig ? " " The Bastians keep no pigs , and I saw no cat , " he said , at the same time thinking that one often saw no cat , yet there might have been one . Yet he insisted he knew what he had heard : the wail of a human child  --  a singular , isolated note he could have discerned in the mighty cacophony of a tempest . He said again , " It was neither pig nor cat , but human child . Edward denied hearing it , but the lie was writ large upon his face . " " But whose child ? " Joan wondered . " His own , some other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret , for she liked Edward . He seemed an honest , decent young man of stalwart parts . He had been their only ally in the castle . Now he , too , had come under suspicion . Exhausted from her adventures , she gently released herself from his embrace and began to prepare for bed while the multiplying mysteries vexed her soul . " So , " she said a little later , " our store of facts are these : that Conroy is lurking about the castle locking doors behind him , but we do n't know why ; that Edward has a child he keeps mum about , but we do n't know whose ; that an empty chest has something to do with Sir John 's death , but we do n't know what ; and that a poor wretched girl was cruelly slaughtered under this roof and we can make no more sense of it than to say it happened , and that 's that . "  |p121It  gave Joan little comfort for Matthew to remind her that most of the facts she had recited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " At least we 're on firmer ground with Una . The purpose of her deception is clear . " " To find our secret purposes out , " he said . " I detest a household spy , " she said categorically , and then she remembered that she was one herself . " Her amorous encounter with Wylkin makes the case stronger against her , " Matthew said . " He 's Stafford 's eyes and ears at Thorncombe . It 's impossible to think that one such as he could love without ulterior motive . " " She who lies down with dogs must rise with fleas , " Joan said . But Edward 's duplicity bothered her most . He seemed such a pleasant young man , yet she knew the devil had power to assume a pleasing shape . Perhaps Edward was an ally of Una 's , and therefore in league with Wylkin . Or a co-conspirator with Conroy ? The household of Thorncombe offered to her imagination the prospect of any number of entangled alliances . He was already asleep when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casement , and would he be a good dear and see to it . He murmured yes , crawled out of bed , and groped his way toward the window . He could see as his eyes adjusted to the dark how the curtains fluttered nervously . He pulled them back and saw the casement was ajar . He looked out on the view that Joan had seen for the first time earlier that day and it held him there for a moment . The moon had risen over the distant hills and had transformed the lake into a breathtaking scene . The island at the lake 's center seemed impaled upon a shaft of yellow light expanding from the base of the hills at the farther shore to the nearer . He stood there long enough marveling for Joan to be aware of his delay . She called out sleepily , " Matthew ? " He replied , not wanting to leave the scene . " I 'm here . At the window . Coming to bed soon , my love . " He continued to watch . The moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster . His sleepiness fell from him . She called again , " Come , Matthew , back to bed . " There wasp122impatience in her voice . He started to obey . Then he stopped , thought for a moment , and then returned quickly for a second look . He had seen something . Something moving in all that stillness of light ; something that had belatedly registered upon his consciousness and which now curiosity drove him back to the window to confirm . " Matthew , will you come to bed , or do you think to stand there all night gawking ? What are you looking at ? " " I thought I saw something moving , down by the lakeshore , " he said . He pulled the curtain and stared hard through the glass . Down across the greensward to the water 's edge he could see a solitary figure . Then it moved again . Toward the water . Within seconds he saw the human figure merge with an oblong shape . He knew what it was . Sir John 's boat setting forth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her irritation at his delay had been replaced with concern . He was aware , without looking behind him , of how she would be propped up now , upon her elbows , staring into the darkness . Or into the moonlight rather as it filtered through the glass . He strained his eyes to see again . There was nothing ; only the shimmering water . " I 'm going down there , " he said . " I saw a man , and Sir John 's missing boat . " " Surely , you 're not thinking  --  " " Yes . You stay where you are . I only want a closer look . " " But , Matthew ! " she protested . " It must be eleven o'clock . The whole house is abed . The night is cold , and a young woman ofthe house has been cruelly murdered ! " " Someone has found the boat and set forth upon the water . I want to find out who . " " A lunatic  --  or worse . " " Lunatic or demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Matthew said with determination . " I 'll come with you , " she said , making an effort to free herself from the tangle of bedding . " Absolutely not , " Matthew said sharply . " I 'll be back in no time . I only want a look . " " But it might be that rascal Wylkin , " she said.  | " Or Conroy , " he said , planting a kiss upon her head . " Go to sleep . I said I 'd be right back , and so I will . " " See that you are , " she said in what was more plea than command , for with all his hardihood she had great fears for his safety . A candle helped him down through the sleeping house . Outdoors , the effulgent moon sufficed . He crossed the greensward swiftly , making directly for the lake . Soon he was standing where he had stood earlier that day when Edward told him the history of the lake and pointed to the place where Sir John had drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew , straining to see or hear , saw nothing but the placid water . Nor was there any other sign that what he had seen from his casement had material substance . But Matthew knew what he had seen , and he knew it had been no spirit . His suspicion fell on Conroy . Conroy was strong , an experiencedsoldier , a practiced braggart who exulted in his physical prowess . It was Conroy , too , who had had charge of his master 's shallop . Matthew conjectured that Conroy had hid the shallop , had come down in the dead of night to fetch it , and was now upon the lake in the same craft , rowing with his powerful arms . But to what end ? For exercise ? To convey himself to the opposite shore , to which a reasonable man could as easily get by walking around ? Matthew was left with the island . The assumption gave him a platform to build on . But havingtheorized as to the identity of the person and his activity , the nextquestion was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to journey to the island at midnight ? Indeed , why go at all ? Matthew was starting to shiver a little . He realized that his vigilmight go on all night . Joan would be beside herself with worry . Hedecided to go back . But first he resolved to establish more firmly oneof his assumptions  --  to promote it from assumption to fact , ifpossible . He retraced his steps through the woods , then went to thestable , where he knew from Joan that Conroy had been exiled . Hethought that if Conroy was in bed , then he was not rowing upon thep124lake , and although the opposite fact did not necessarily hold , it would strengthen mightily the assumption that it was Conroy whom Matthew had seen . Warm odors of horse and hay assailed him as he opened the door , then he groped in the darkness of the stalls until he came to the little room that had been Edward 's and was now , according to the hostler , Conroy 's . There was enough light from the moon to show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Conroy , but the man 's doublet and cloak were spread out on the pallet in the corner , and beneath were the sword and heavy soldier 's boots Matthew had never seen the man without . While Matthew was gone , Joan turned and tossed in a fit of worry . Then she collected herself and planned just what words and phrases she would use to chide him for his foolhardiness . If he returned alive . Of which she was in grave and painful doubt . " Thank God ! " she exclaimed when she heard his knock and reassuring voice that it was he and no other . But she was also curious to learn what worthy fruit he 'd plucked from his recklessness . Matthew told her that he thought it was Conroy he had seen and that the lake isle was his destination . He told her all the evidence he had gathered to that effect , hard fact as well as tentative supposition . She agreed it was very likely Conroy was their man . " Rowing to the island ! At this hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed . " Mad indeed , and therefore I infer it to be well motivated . Surely he 's not doing it for the exercise . " " But searching for what ? " " God knows , but I 'll find that out , too , " Matthew said . " Well , " she said . " Confront him tomorrow . Demand to know what he 's up to . Tell him we know it was he who lurked behind the door in the White Keep to frighten silly women and rows by night to islands . " " That might be unwise , " Matthew cautioned . " If he 's murdereras well as prowler  --  "  | " And boat thief as well , " she inserted . " It would be better to keep him ignorant of what we know . For now , at least . " Joan agreed in principle , remembering the dangerous looks Conroy had given her . " Did you make fast the door ? " she asked . " Thrice over if it were possible , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was another question badly wanting an answer . And soon . Joan fell asleep and dreamed of the lake and the island and Conroy rowing across the dark water.  |p126Alice  Stafford was a plain-looking , plain-speaking woman of about thirty . Short and plump like a partridge , she ruled her house and her husband with boisterous efficiency . She was the daughter of a well-to-do farmer in the shire , , and her marriage to Thomas Stafford eight years earlier had been considered an excellent match on her part  --  a step up the rung of the social ladder . The only blemish upon the cheeks of her fortune was that there never was enough money in the household coffers to suit her purposes . Therefore she regarded her husband as a failure and reminded him of the fact at least twice a day . They quarreled endlessly about matters great and small , but the truth was they had a good deal in common . Both husband and wife were preoccupied with themselves , were arrogant and peevish ; each was inclined to do things behind the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Alice and her husband were relieved that she had never borne children , and both had an inordinate desire for money and were terribly frustrated at not having more of it . They were , therefore , of one mind with respect to Sir John Challoner 's Irish plunder . They agreed they deserved it more than the baronet 's niece , and even more than Her Majesty the Queen , who , after all , was rich enough already and was very near unto death , if rumor spoke true . Alice Stafford 's reasoning in that regard was that thep127Queen would hardly miss what she never knew she had , did n't need , could n't use . Neither husband nor wife had qualms about securing the plunder by any means necessary . While neither would have stooped to rob a church ; the church having been robbed , the plunder was up for grabs to whoever should grab first . And Sir John having neither need ( since he was dead ) , nor right ( since the plunder was plundered ) , neither did young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-gotten gains were best distributed to those Sir John had wronged by his aristocratic arrogance in general and his egregious tampering with nature in particular . And thus it was that since the happy hour in which Jack Wylkin had proved his worth by bringing word of the hidden treasure of Thorncombe , a period of unusual domestic harmony had prevailed at Stafford Hall . Uniting in their larcenous enterprise , husband and wife smiled tenderly upon each other . Alice 's carping about money ceased , and the couple spent many a pleasant hour contemplating what they would do when they were truly rich . The only difference in their attitudes toward the Irish booty was that while Thomas Stafford sometimes feared the story might be but a dream , Alice 's faith never wavered . She coaxed her husband forward in the project , encouraged him to engage Wylkin in even more desperate efforts of espionage , and insisted on being a party to every aspect of the conspiracy . It was to that end that on the evening of Stafford 's encounter with Thorncombe 's new steward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alice and Thomas Stafford were waiting with great eagerness the arrival of Wylkin from his most recent rendezvous with Una . They were seated in comfortable chairs in the withdrawing room of Stafford Hall , which , although not as commodiousas its counterpart at Thorncombe , was well heated , and secure from the pryings of their servants . " What does Wylkin intend to have from the Irish wench ? " Alice Stafford asked with a coarseness she affected when participating in her husband 's scheming . " Intelligence concerning the new steward and his wife , " Stafford answered . Above the fireplace there was a mantelpiece upon which sat a stolid German clock . It ticked very loudly and then began striking the hour . Nine gongs . Wylkin was late . " The pair could make trouble , could n't they ? "  |p128Stafford  turned from the clock and his irritation at Wylkin 's tardiness to face his wife , for they were not seated opposite each other but very nearly side by side , both facing the fire . " Nothing I ca n't handle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle , " she answered dryly . It was her turn to stare moodily into the fire . Stafford winced at the remark . It was a casual slur , but it seemed to have graver implications . Although his wife had long professed her distaste for Wylkin , Stafford had noticed her looking at him more closely of late . And the looks she had given Wylkin seemed to Stafford to be quite bold , to say the least . Provocative , even ! He would have inquired of her whether there was not somethingpassing between his wife and his servant but he was hesitant to start a quarrel . Yet the question stuck in his gut and he was beside himself to have it out . Then Wylkin appeared , dressed in a sable doublet and hose that gave him an even more predatory appearance than usual . He bowed respectfully to his master , favored Alice with a deferential nod , and then presented his report . " Una says the Irishman has been laying low since the new steward and housekeeper came . Sleeps in the stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Una 's convinced Conroy knows where the booty is hidden and is only waiting the right opportunity to snatch it . " " And how does she know that ? " Alice asked , lifting her round face to address Wylkin . " Pure instinct , madam , " Wylkin said . " The way one dog sniffs out another though the chamber where they lie be as black as pitch . Conroy stays at Thorncombe for no apparent reason except for some ridiculous account of how he must wait upon his new mistress . Evidently , he also has some claim as a scholar of Sir John 's papers , but Una has never seen the man read a sign properly , much less a book . It 's all a gross imposture . Trust me , he 's biding his time because he knows where the gold is , or does n't know and is still looking . " " Well , tell the woman to keep a close eye on Conroy . I wo n't be cheated out of what 's mine by a knavish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for support of this position.  | " And what of the new steward and his wife ? " Alice asked . " Una says they 're a nosy pair . " " How so ? " asked Stafford , looking up suddenly . " In act more than word ; she distrusts them both , and more particularly the woman . The two of them spent the greater part of the day surveying the castle . " " But have they said anything about Irish treasure ? " Stafford asked . " Not according to Una . But then , if they did know about the treasure , they would not likely spread it about Thorncombe . " " What is the wife like ? " Alice wanted to know . " I 've not yet seen her , " said Wylkin . " But were she notable for brains and beauty , Una would have remarked upon it . The husband is a dull-brained fellow . Looks like a shopkeeper or corn factor . But I do n't trust him more for that . " " It seems your Una @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alice said coyly , cocking her head at her husband 's servant . Wylkin turned again to his mistress , and with a graceful inclination of the head an experienced courtier might have emulated , said , " I admit to my instincts , madam . They have kept me whole against more than one varlet bent upon cutting my throat for some real or imagined offense to his honor . I say the man Stock can not be trusted . And since man and wife are one flesh according to Holy Writ , I conclude that Mistress Stock can not be trusted either . To be what they seem , that is . " " I 'm in thorough agreement , " Stafford said abruptly , displeasedby the flirtatious exchange and thinking it was high time he interrupted it . " Stock seems to be a good deal more than he appears . Wylkin is right to be careful . Will Una continue to watch Conroy ? " " She will , sir . " " Very good . When do you meet again ? " " Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be wary of the Irishman . Ile goes armed . " " Yes , sir . " " And watch the Irishwoman as well , " Alice teased . " For the same reason.  | " I thought you could n't abide Wylkin , " Stafford remarked to his wife after his servant had gone . " I ca n't , " she said . " He 's so full of himself . A little Machiavel in his sable suit . I wonder he can afford it . What is it you pay him ? " He told her outright , while she regarded him with that skeptical expression she had  --  the right eye lifted in mock surprise , the round soft chin jutting forward . " A princely sum for so princely a knave , but his doublet cost at least that . So whence comes the residue ? " He said , " I do n't know where he gets the residue , ' as you call it , but you did seem overly familiar with him . Do you take me for a fool ? Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She eyed him coldly and turned her little body toward his . " Overly familiar with Wylkin ? Do you jest , husband ? With Wylkin ? My God , man , Wylkin is as ugly as a crow  --  as thin as a rail . He could wrap his body around a woman thrice before she knew who had her . " " Do you speak from experience , dearest ? " Stafford replied with reckless sarcasm . The exchange had violated the little Eden their mutual greed had recently created . Each regarded the other across an abyss of silence . The German clock ticked ; the faggots afire cracked and popped . Meanwhile Stafford withered under his wife 's icy glare . He pulled at his beard and looked at her bleakly . Neither husband nor wife could believe what sudden anger had forced him to speak . But both understood the words could not be easily withdrawn . Like arrows shot skyward , they were now beyond the control of the archer . " What did you say ? " Alice said , as though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been minted . He repeated the accusation  --  not because he meant it now but because she had asked him to and he wanted to withdraw it . But before he could find the words to make amends , Alice was upon him . She sprang from her chair and began beating his head and shoulders with her little fists , great tears of rage in her eyes and terrible curses and countercharges on her lips . The conflict brought at least three of their servants from other regions of the house scrambling to see who was murdering whom.  | " Get out , get out , you wretches ! All of you , be gone ! " Stafford bellowed , glaring at the intruders at the same time he was trying to fend off his wife 's assault . The startled servants shut the door again , suppressing their laughter . They had witnessed such scenes between their master and his wife many times and always found them more diverting than a bearbaiting or public execution . Later that same evening , Thomas Stafford and his little wife declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they both laughed at how silly it was for him to suppose that there could ever be anything between Alice and her husband 's manservant . Alice in turn apologized for the bruises she had inflicted in defense of her honor . " The honor you assailed , who should have defended it to the death , " she pointed out , thereby firing the last salvo in their war of words . Stafford sighed heavily and leaned toward his wife . They sealed their truce with a good deal of wine and more talk of Challoner 's treasure . The candles burned low and were replaced with fresh ones . A servant brought more wine , and departed the master 's chamber marveling that such a tumultuous evening should have brought the master and his wife to this haven of marital concord . " Will you come to bed , then , Alice my chuck ? " Stafford said in a wheedling voice he used when they were on good terms . Alice Stafford considered her husband 's proposition . She had kept up with her husband in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he a quite different person  --  a cleverer , more attractive one . Ordinarily they slept in different rooms . He beseeched her a second time . She looked at her husband . His bedraggled , bleary-eyed , hirsute appearance did not arouse her passion , but she supposed , even as light-headed as she was , that a simulated surrender would not he impolitic . Stafford had the pleasure of watching his wife undress , which she did very slowly and with an undulating motion of her plump hips , as though she were dancing to the accompaniment of a lute . Pink and sensuous in the candlelight , she seemed a different woman . The candlelight flattered her bare , round shoulders and heavy breasts and thighs and quickened a response in his groin thatp132had long slept . Naked as a babe but with a grin of triumph on her face , her golden hair unleashed from its restraints and her arms open as though to welcome his own , Alice Stafford moved with artful deliberation toward her husband 's bed . But she was not thinking of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the princely villain Jack Wylkin and of what it must be like to feel that lanky , knotty body wound around her own . And even at the moment of her husband 's most passionate fumblings , she had uppermost in her mind a stinging envy of the Irishwoman with whom Jack Wylkin rutted in his master 's service.  |p133Matthew  went down to breakfast by himself next morning , leaving Joan to lie abed awhile and the Irish maids to commence their labors without a housekeeper 's supervision , which they managed to do much more successfully than Moll had predicted . As he descended the stairs , he could hear voices and laughter coming from the kitchen . Among the voices , speaking in Irish , was Conroy 's booming tenor . Matthew entered and saw Conroy holding forth to Una and two grocers ' boys who had brought provisions from the village and had lingered in the kitchen for a free breakfast of cheese and eggs . The boys , who spoke no Irish , were evidently by their expression enjoying Conroy 's story as much as Una @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased , the boys hurried on their way , and Una began automatically to prepare a breakfast for Matthew . Conroy , dressed as was his custom with his sword at his side and in his canvas jerkin with the buttons , bid Matthew good day and asked about Joan 's welfare as though he and she had never wrangled about his place in the castle . " Oh , my wife does very well , " Matthew replied , regarding Conroy carefully . The man did not seem the worse for wear from his previous night 's activities . He asked Conroy how he liked his new accommodations.  | " Oh , the stable , you mean , " Conroy replied with a casual gesture of dismissal . " Well now , it 's hardly a palace , but then it will do . I hold no grudges , Master Stock . And would be glad to have you and your good wife as friends . " Conrov offered to shake Matthew 's hand , an amiable gesture Matthew did not decline . Warning himself not to be seduced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us friends . " " Not that I spend much time there , " Conroy said , picking up the thread of the conversation as it regarded his new quarters . " You 're gone much of nights , then ? " Matthew asked , commencing to eat and trying to frame the question so that it did not sound accusatory . But Conroy showed no reluctance to answer . He seemed instead delighted to reply in the affirmative . " A quick drink and an easy woman are a soldier 's solace . I readily confess few nights will see me in bed before cockcrow . " " You must have a hardy constitution to maintain such a rigorous life , " Matthew said . " Oh , for a fact , sir , " said Conroy . " Why , just last night I spent the better part of six hours drinking in the Black Duck . And a fine swollen noggin I have this morning for my effort . " " Is that so , " replied Matthew , trying to sound sympathetic in the face of this obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " he said . " That explains why you made no answer to my call when I was in the stable last night . " Conroy 's expression changed at this . His eyes became serious and his lips formed a tight little smile . " You were in the stable last night ? And what hour would that have been ? " " Oh , quite late . After the moon was up . Eleven or twelve of the clock at the very least . " " A very dangerous hour to be abroad , " said Conroy nervously . " What did you want of me ? " " Oh , nothing but a good stout rope . " Conroy made a face to suggest he had n't heard Matthew 's answer . " A rope , " Matthew repeated , slipping into the falsehood with the ease of a practiced liar . " My good wife made me promise to fetch it for her earlier in the day and I forgot . She wanted it to hangp135clothes upon . But she remembered my promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she recalled it , asked me if I had complied . No , said I. So she sent me to do her bidding , maugre the hour and the darkness , telling me I should have no satisfaction from her body until she should have joy of my obedience . Down came I to the stable half-naked , with only the moon as a lamp , to do what I should have done earlier . But I found no rope . I called you out , thinking you might know where one was . " Conroy grinned broadly . The story seemed to put him at ease . " I was in town when you came to find me , " he said . " With a good half-dozen stoups of the innkeeper 's ale to my credit and an Irish song in my heart . A local wench , too , on my lap  --  the fairest skin and most amiable disposition this side of heaven . But if it 's rope you want , well , there are ropes aplenty . In the saddlery . " Conroy explained where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . He had not liked lying about the rope  --  worse yet , the implication that he was ruled by his wife . But the Irishman seemed to accept the story and perhaps , too , think less of Matthew for having told it . Which was all to Matthew 's purpose . As long as the Irishman believed Matthew to be a fool , Matthew might fool the Irishman at will . Conroy said he had to go off about some errand . Matthew said good-bye and finished his breakfast . Afterward he went to the stable , arriving just in time to see Conroy riding off in the direction of town . He greeted Edward , who was busy filling the horse trough with water and explained what he sought . " There 's rope in the saddlery , " Edward said , without asking its use . Matthew went into the saddlery and found a length of rope that seemed about right . The story of the rope had been pure invention  --  a device for drawing Conroy out and learning how the Irishman would explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Matthew 's suspicions about the young soldier 's nocturnal voyage and its ulterior purpose . Matthew had come to the stable to acquire the rope largely to make his story good . But while he had walked across the greensward he 'd glanced down the sloping lawn to the lakeside and beyond to the island and a new idea came to his mind . It was a more practicalp136use for the rope . And it had nothing whatsoever to do with hanging out clothes . " At least we know he was n't trying to drown himself , " Joan said when later in the morning Matthew told her about his conversation with Conroy and the lie the Irishman had told . They were sitting in the parlor of the new house , whispering even though Matthew had taken the precaution of seeing that none of the maids or Una were listening at the door . " No , his story about going into town last night proves I am right . It was he . Looking for something that he wants to keep to himself when he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own . A letter had arrived from London while Matthew was in the stable . It was from Frances Challoner and announced her imminent arrival at Thorncombe . The wedding day had been advanced . There was no explanation why . " What 's on her mind ? " Matthew asked . " She 's to be married in a week , " Joan replied . " Here , read for yourself . " Joan held out the letter to Matthew , who took it and began to read . The small , cramped penmanship of the Challoner heiress was not easy to decipher , and Joan , who had had greater opportunity to peruse the letter , gave Matthew some help with the more difficult words . " It says the husband 's name is Master Thomas Cooke . " " A gentleman , doubtless , " Joan said . " I am sure of it . " " She says they plan to live at Thorncombe . " " Yes , strange , is n't it ? " Joan said . " I ca n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light of her uncle 's murder . But perhaps her suspicions have waned since we left . Love may be all she thinks of these days . " Matthew thought of Frances Challoner  --  the willowy court beauty that someone had said resembled the Queen when young . Yes , Dan Cupid might have changed her desire for vengeance to desire of a more pleasant sort . Joan was right . Love was known for such miracles . The question was : Where did that leave theirp137investigation of the murder ? " Did she say anything about her uncle 's death ? " " Read on . It 's all there , " Joan said . Matthew read on . " She prays our inquiries have good success and says she hopes to hear from us soon . " " By the way , " Joan said . " Have you written again to Sir Robert ? " Matthew shook his head . " I 've decided to wait . I have nothing to report as of now  --  nothing of which we 're sure . And yet I feel we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the island . " Joan reminded him of the chest she 'd found . That , too , seemed a part of the conundrum . " I have a plan , " he said . She leaned forward , her eyes full of curiosity . " It 's not without its risks . " Her curiosity changed to concern . " Well , speak , I pray you . Do n't keep me hanging . What is this risky thing you plan ? " " I reason thus , " Matthew said . " If Conroy had found what he wanted on the island , he would be gone , for I can hardly imagine why else he would remain . I think therefore he 'll be rowing back to it . Probably tonight . The full moon will be his guide . " " And so what is it you intend , husband ? " He turned his eyes from her . He knew she would not be pleased with what was in his mind , but the truth was he was getting desperate . Their month at Thorncombe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way to Thorncombe . Their task would not become easier , and perhaps it would become impossible . It was not merely failure he feared , but disgrace : humiliation for him ; grave embarrassment for Sir Robert , who had sung his praises before the Queen . She repeated : " What is it you intend , Matthew ? Tell me ! " Matthew strolled down toward the lake across the smooth grass with the ease of a man without a worry in the world . It was past dinner and he had fed himself well . But he had chosen this moment carefully . He knew Conroy was still in Buxton . Getting his drinking out of the way early to leave his night free for more athletic endeavors , or so Matthew hoped . Edward had gone home at noonp138to care for his father and would not be hack to Thorncombe until three or four o'clock . Joan had the supervision of the entire female staff in cleaning and moving furniture into the previously unused sleeping chambers . And so Matthew could trust that his movements would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was safely enveloped there , he drew the length of rope from his pocket.  |p139At  dusk , Matthew looked out over the broad sheet of Challoner 's lake . As a boy he had waded in his own Chelrner , a languorous winding stream , and the cool running water had given him pleasure . But deeper , more turbulent water made him uneasy . He had never learned to swim , and even his efforts to float only proved his capacity to sink like a stone . An involuntary plunge into the Thames a year or so earlier during an adventure in London had nearly been fatal . The experience still haunted him . He had given thought to Joan 's vision , too . But duty was a demanding mistress , and curiosity even more tyrannical . There had only been one way to find out what Conroy was doing on the island , and that was to see for himself . Since Sir John 's shallop was unavailable , a raft seemed Matthew 's only means of transport . Earlier he had found several good round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had brought from the saddlery he bound them together . He dragged the raft over to the water 's edge and then sat down and waited for night . He knew Joan would keep the women of the castle well occupied , despite her vociferous reservations regarding his purpose , once she had got it out of him . Between the time he completed the raft and dusk he had slept , for he was very weary from the night before and was uncertain as to the rigors before him.  |p140Now  the lake 's surface was a mirror of dark , shifting hues . The island floated upon it like a demasted galleon . He tried to estimate how far off it was . About a hundred yards , he reckoned . About the space between his own shop in Chelmsford and that of his neighbor , Malachi Braden . An easy walk . But this was across water . The lake looked shallow , and so Edward had said it was . But perhaps the water was deeper than it looked . The hostler had also mentioned holes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his head . He eyed his raft . It was the first he had ever made . How buoyant would it prove to be once he had left the safety of the shore and waded out through the sedge ? He decided optimistically that if the raft sank or rolled , it would probably do so upon launching . The water would certainly be shallow near the shore and he might get a dunking for his pains but nothing worse . If things fell out that way , he would take the disaster as a sign from heaven that the whole enterprise was as dangerous as Joan had warned . But still , while he thought these things , he could hear Joan saying , " Foolish , Matthew . Foolish , indeed . " And he felt guilty about the worry his adventure would cause her . The day had now been reduced to a sliver of light along the rim of the western hills . He reached down and removed his shoes , then stripped off all but hose and shirt . He hid his clothing under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft in behind him . The water was colder than he had expected , and the sensation of his bare feet sinking into the unseen muck at the lake bottom unnerved him . It was not drowning he feared so much as his vulnerability to what he could not see , and in such water , even in the broad light of day nothing could be seen . He recalled again now with special pertinence Joan 's glimmering , and his imagination filled with the watery horrors depicted in books and broadsides  --  of slithering serpents , eels , poisonous toads . He took a deep breath and tried to clear his mind of these images . He said a prayer for safety of body and soul and , finding courage again , he moved beyond the sedge to open water . He was now up to his waist , his feet sinking into the ooze , bumping against submerged logs , stones . Like an old man with a bent back he pulled the raft after him , facing toward the island . When the water was lapping against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it firmly in hand , he pulled himself up onto it . For an anxious moment he thought the raft would roll over , or sink . Water surged around him ; he clung desperately to the logs , a spasm of terror in his throat . He quickly adjusted his weight . The raft lifted out of the water and his legs dangled in watery space . He maintained momentum now with a slow , methodical kick and steered toward the island , his face thrust forward . He tried to fix his mind exclusively on his goal , if only to avoid the terrors of his imagination . Above him the stars shone boldly , a multitude of witnesses . But cold and indifferent . Somewhere in their midst were God 's eyes , or so Matthew devoutly prayed . How far had he traveled ? The island seemed no closer . Yet already he was weary of the exertion . For a while he stopped , floated , his legs dangling free in the water . How far to the bottom ? He extended his legs into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the raft . Nothing . He looked up at the stars . And for a moment something of the awe he had felt the night before quickened his pulse . But his admiration for the beauty above him , cold and distant and mute , was mixed with apprehension . His legs loose and dangling , he felt more dependent than ever on the raft . What if the cordage should slacken or snap ? What if the logs lost their buoyancy ? These fears made him so nervous he decided to resume treading , even though he was not fully rested . He turned toward the island . Was it merely hope , or did the island appear closer than before ? Yes , it was closer . The darkness of the island had enlarged , had begun to take a shape . He could make out the tower and the vegetation around it . He was making progress , and his heart was beating with a steady anxious rhythm to match his tread . Then his left foot struck something hard , then his right . Rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom , hard now , not soft and yielding as before . He was not sure how long the water had been shallow enough for him to stand , but when he got to his feet he was surprised to see the water came only to his thighs . A few additional steps , the raft pushed in front of him , lowered it to midcalf . He could see the finer features of the island now . He could see a narrow beach of rocks andp142pebbles where he might land . But he decided to circle the island as a precaution . He had waded only a few feet when suddenly he was head under , his feet extending into nothingness . Struggling for breath , he groped about in the oily darkness , realizing to his horror that he had stepped into some hole and the raft was floating beyond his grasp . He went down , down , and then touched a hard , invisible bottom . He pushed himself upward with the last of his strength . His head broke through into the night air and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . It was his near-drowning in the Thames all over again . His body remembered what his mind could not ; automatically he began to beat his arms , kick with his feet . A yard or so ahead he could see the raft . He extended his reach toward it , and his lower parts floated upward . He kept reaching and reaching , gulping down the water , catching what desperate breaths he could . Then he caught hold and with one final kick propelled himself far enough onto the raft that he could sustain himself without vigorous effort . He floated for a while , not twenty feet from the island shore , afraid to try wading again for fear the water was too deep . Was it possible the island was surrounded by a trench ? Or had he simply and unluckily stepped into an old mine ? He floated until the wave of panic passed him and his breathing returned to normal . Then he maneuvered the raft toward the island and kept kicking until the water was too shallow to kick and he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island he had selected as a landing place was heavily overgrown with hushes . The bank was steeper and there was no natural harbor . But he did see a spot that seemed to afford cover for his raft . He secured the raft with the loose end of his rope and then , using the bushes as handholds , he scrambled up the bank . Matthew was muddy and shivering and nearly exhausted but relieved to be on dry ground again . He had completed the first half of the perilous journey from the mainland , despite Joan 's worst fears and his own . And in good time . Already the glow of the moon could he seen . Then , slowly , the great disk itself . Matthew waited , shivering . There was no purpose in his stumbling about , breaking his neck in the tangle of weeds and bushes . He thought Conroy would wait too.  |p143Then  the moon was up , coating the island in its pale , sickly light . He made his way through the dense growth and came to the crown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down on the narrow beach where he had been afraid to land and to the other side where he had hidden the raft . A path led up from the beach to the tower . The tower was a foot or so taller than he was . There were a wooden door and one window , higher than the door . Not more than a slit . If there was time , he would enter the tower and look around later . First he circled the tower to have a look at the other end of the island . He found a scraggly bush about a dozen feet from the tower door that also gave a view of the beach below the tower , and he concealed himself in its foliage . During the next hour  --  and it must have been the most of that  --  Matthew had cause to wonder whether the most foolish decision he had made that night was not his voyage to the island but the assumption that Conroy would make another one himself . What if Conroy did n't come ? Should Matthew stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the tower while there was moonlight ? But he was afraid that if he began to move about , Conroy would come . And so he waited . It was another half hour by his best reckoning when he heard the telltale sound of oars being dipped and lifted . It was so subtle at first that he thought it his imagination . But then the sound grew louder and the splashes more regular . He peered through the leaves to see down across the water . The moon had turned the water into thousands of glittering spangles . He could see nothing , but his heart had begun to beat rapidly with anticipation . He had not waited in vain . It was Conroy . He was sure of it . Foolishly , Matthew now reflected , he had brought no weapon with him , not even a knife . And as he continued to search the waters for Conroy , he began to be afraid . Conroy was a brawny , younger man , inured to manslaughter and not likely to be happy to find a spy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that danger when he saw the shallop nosing toward shore . He could see it was Conroy at the oars.  |p144Matthew  held his breath and watched while Conroy pulled the shallop up on the rocks and then began to climb up the trail that led to the tower . The Irishman had dressed for vigorous work  --  he wore nothing but his shirt and his long hose , and the sleeves of the shirt were rolled to his elbows . Conroy opened the door to the tower and disappeared inside . For a while Matthew heard nothing . Then a glimmer of light appeared in the narrow slit that was the tower 's only window and Matthew could hear the sound of digging . Matthew waited . The moon rose to midpoint of its course and then began its descent ; still Conroy dug on . Meanwhile Matthew was suffering from his cramped position , which was something between a kneel and a squat . He was colder than ever , and he almost envied the physical exertion and freedom of movement of the man digging inside the tower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his earlier supposition was correct : that Conroy 's purpose was to find rather than conceal . But to find what ? Something hidden , obviously , but by whom and why ? He was pondering these questions still when the digging ceased and the light inside the tower was put out . Conroy emerged . Without chest , box , or sack . He went the way he had come , down the trail and then to the shallop . Matthew waited until he could hear the rise and fall of the oars again before he left his place of concealment and even after until he was confident Conroy was to shore again . Standing was both a relief and an agony . His joints ached ; he flapped his arms and jogged where he stood to warm his blood . The exercise rejuvenated him and made him curious . He went over to the tower and looked inside . There was still enough of a moon to show the interior  --  an empty chamber of about a dozen feet squared with an earthen floor and the dank smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tools  --  a spade and pick . There was also an oil lamp . He could see , too , that Conroy 's excavations had been thorough . The entire floor had been plowed and smoothed again . Whatever Conroy had hoped to find buried here , he had not found . Yetp145Matthew felt strongly that Conroy had not finished his search . He would be back  --  perhaps not stopping until he had dug up the entire island . Matthew went down to where he had hidden his raft , uncovered it , boarded it , and pushed off , having accustomed himself on his outward voyage to its handling . His return was uneventful and , mercifully , it seemed quicker . He was nearly to shore when he remembered he had not covered his footprints in the tower . Surely when Conroy returned he would see the evidence that his nocturnal mischief had not gone unobserved . It was half-dark when Wylkin finally saw Una hurrying toward him through the trees . He was vexed by her delay and made no effort to conceal it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore no compulsion to be courtly . " God 's bodkins , woman ! In good time , you 've come . Did we not agree to meet at six o'clock ? " " Faith , Jack , I could not come sooner , " Una said breathlessly . Her hands , swollen and red , lay upon her breast , as though to still her racing heart . She looked around nervously . " The housekeeper has had the lot of us at work since dinner . She would not take her eyes from us , I swear it . It 's only now that I was allowed to go  --  to make supper . I ca n't stay long . " " Damn her then , " Wylkin said . " But that is n't the worst , " Una said , looking up at him sheepishly . " What is the worst ? " he asked . " She saw us . " " Who ? " " Mistress Stock , the housekeeper . ' " When ? " " Yesterday . She saw where we met , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seized her by the shoulders and shook her , as though she were responsible for their betrayal . And he believed her to be so . " What , did she accuse you ? Where was she hidden ? Tell me , woman , and be quick about it . " " She was hiding , hiding over yonder , amid the ferns , " Unap146said , trembling at her lover 's outburst . She pointed to the place . " She did n't think I saw her . But I did . I saw her gown . " " Then why in Christ 's name did n't you say something , but let the two of us talk with her within earshot ? " " I did n't see her until after we had parted . I thought she would rise up and denounce the two of us , but she never did . Nor did she say anything later . " " She said nothing ? " he said . " Nothing . She treated me the same as before , by nodding and pointing as though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there thinking , thinking hard what it meant , the housekeeper 's spying and her even stranger failure to denounce the wantonness in a servant . What housekeeper tolerated such behavior under her own nose ? It was most unnatural , the Stock woman 's silence . But then perhaps not so unnatural after all  --  if the woman was more than a housekeeper . If the women was a spy by commission rather than a mere eavesdropper by nature . Wylkin regarded Una with contempt . " You fool , " he said . " Of course Mistress Stock kept you working the long afternoon . Of course she treats you the same . Where was the husband all this time ? Not by his wife 's side , I 'll warrant . " She shook her head , slow to follow his reasoning . " That 's because he was away , looking for the treasure . She kept you and the maids busy for that reason . Do n't you see what she was up to ? " He was so angry he could have throttled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearfully . " The new mistress is coming to Thorncombe . Coming any day , so says Mistress Stock . She 's to be married . " Wylkin cursed roundly . " Are we to be visited by a host ! " he declared , slapping the side of his forehead . His brain began to work rapidly , assimilating this new information . First Conroy had been his major obstacle at the castle . Now it was the Stocks . Should the new mistress arrive with the inevitable train of servants and houseguests , Wylkin 's chance of locating and stealing the Challonerp147treasure would vaporize like mist . He realized that time was of the essence . Angrily , he asked Una when Mistress Frances Challoner was to arrive . Una said she did n't know . No one knew for sure . But it would be soon . Her ignorance infuriated him . She stood before him dumb and quaking . She had never seen him in such a temper . A dread swept over her . She wanted to return to the castle but she was afraid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder in a conciliatory gesture but he turned on her abruptly and struck her across the face with the back of his hand . It hit her hard , but the stinging blow was not so painful as it was humiliating . " Stupid bitch , stupid old woman ! " he shouted . Then he angrily turned and strode off into the darkness . Great scalding tears blinded her . She realized now how little he cared for her and she felt dirtied by his embraces and deeply regretful that she had ever told him about Sir John 's hidden treasure . She stood there a long time in the darkness . Finally , she roused herself and wiped the tears from her cheeks . Feeling abandoned and disconsolate , she walked hack through the gloom , anger growing within her . It was as though she had been impregnated by Wylkin 's slap and what was growing at a vastly accelerated pace was not a human child but a devil of vengeance to which she would presently give birth to the undoing of him who had betrayed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of futile effort , Conroy passed through the dark stable cursing to himself , thinking how he might have better spent the night in Buxton with his boon companions and the fair-haired wench with the long legs than in digging up half of Challoner 's island seeking a treasure that might not exist at all . As he kicked open the door to his quarters his nostrils were immediately assailed by a foul odor he knew only too well from his experiences on the battlefield : putrefying flesh . It was unmistakable , for there was no other smell like it , on earth or in hell.  |p148Alert  to danger and vulnerable without a weapon in his hand , he assumed a protective stance , his muscles tense , his eyes straining to pierce the darkness . Slowly his vision improved and he could see his pallet , his clothes there as he had left them , but not the sword , which at the moment was his chief concern . In its place was a burlap bag . A practical joke ? After a few minutes , when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked over to the table where the nub of a candle was , struck a flint , and lighted the wick . A little flame appeared and he looked around . He decided that if it was a dead animal inside the bag , as he suspected it was  --  considering at the same time which of his companions at the Black Duck possessed such a mad humor as to plague him so  --  the prankster would be very sorry indeed when Michael Conroy laid his hands on him . And if the same prankster had also stolen Conroy 's sword , then the fellow would be sorrier still . He hefted the hag , judged its weight to be about that of a cat or small dog , and turned its contents upside down upon the floor . Even by candlelight it took Conroy a few moments to recognize what fell , went hump , and then rolled toward the pallet . He felt his gorge rise and heavy beads of sweat break out upon his face . He had seen the heads of hundreds of men fixed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland and England both . But he had never seen a woman so treated  --  and especially a woman he had known , in senses both common and biblical  --  for he recognized , despite decomposition that made mock of the once winning countenance , the hair , face , and dull staring eyes of Aileen Mogaill . He thought she had run off , like so many before her . He was too stunned by his discovery , too disgusted and perplexed at how Aileen 's head had come to be where it was to hear what under less stressful circumstances would have at once sent every nerve and sinew of his powerful body to their stations . When he did become aware of the soft tread behind him , it was already too late . Alarmed , he swiveled to face the unseen threat and saw nothing before his eyes but a headlong rush of something cloaked and muffled ,  |p149wielding  a thing with a crescent blade like a sickle , now sweeping through the air in a wide arc . The blow nearly knocked him off his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced , he lifted one hand to staunch the warm river running down his chest and instinctively raised the other to ward off a second assault . But it was an ineffectual defense , and Conroy 's life was draining from him faster than he could feel it go . In the next moment he was as dead as Aileen Mogaill.  |p150Mistress  Frances Challoner 's excitement at the thought of her impending marriage to Master Thomas Cooke of the Middle Temple had done much to alleviate her melancholy preoccupation with her uncle 's death  --  especially since the date of the wedding had been advanced upon the Queen 's urging . Mistress Frances wondered now , in absence of proof to the contrary , if her uncle had not simply drowned by accident after all . A clever girl , she suspected that the Queen 's suggestion that she marry sooner rather than later was intended by the Queen to be a distraction  --  a way of diverting the young woman 's attention from the inadequacy of her champion , Matthew Stock , and perhaps , too , the hopelessness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Queen had observed . Her Majesty had also quoted Saint Paul on the legitimacy of marriage : that it was better to marry than burn . Frances thought these wise words indeed , and as for the little Chelmsford clothier-constable and his wife , she supposed , there having been no report from Thorncombe , that Stock and his wife had failed in their mission . The Challoner heiress was hardly surprised , for although she had a heart as kind as her countenance was gentle , she never doubted the implicit merit of being of old Saxon blood , or the moralp151deficiencies of being of ordinary stock . Thus , while she granted the unprepossessing country constable might be honest and earnest , these qualities , admirable though they were , hardly compensated for a lack of heroic mettle . Young Thomas Cooke was another matter . He was nineteen , a year her senior , the younger son of a Sussex knight of good reputation and modest income . Thomas ' older brother and their father 's heir was a soldier who had distinguished himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cambridge  --  preparing for the Church . Thomas had spent two years at Cambridge and then gone to the Middle Temple , where he hoped for a career in the law . Tall and lean , he had become a great frequenter of plays and a young man of fashion . He had a little blond mustache and a spade-shaped beard that was a bit thin now but gave promise of growing fuller with time . His manner was very polished , very courtly  --  he was witty and eloquent and he could recite verses of all the fashionable poets from memory . These accomplishments impressed Mistress Frances greatly , even though the Cookes were relative newcomers to the gentry , their grandfather having been a London scrivener . And so , if she had had someone like her intended husband to make the proper inquiries at Thorncombe , her confidence would have been much stronger . Her first view of this paragon , had been in the form of his portrait , which showed Thomas Cooke to be very handsome indeed . But when he manifested himself in person several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality than in art . Although Thomas ' ardor was somewhat restrained , he seemed fully in accord with the match . They had met at court , fallen in love without the sponsorship of parents ( she had none to sponsor ; his did not object to the engagement ) , and had come to agreement as to terms . That their marriage was to be solemnized in the ancient seat of the Challoners had been established early in their engagementand was for Mistress Frances as set in stone as the marriage itself . But while all these arrangements were as she wished , one great concern remained . It was a concern not unusual in young virginsp152anticipating the termination of that state . She was reluctant to throw herself so completely on the mercy of her new husband , to lose her identity in his , to trade noble Challoner for gentrified Cooke . And this concern , as preoccupying to her now as her uncle 's unexplained death before , caused her to doubt the motives of her intended husband . She was not so inexperienced in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of younger sons whose patrimony was of necessity curtailed by the rights of the firstborn . That Thomas Cooke was a young man of promise was true . The question was : How substantial was his income ? About such practical matters Thomas , his knighted father , and the Queen herself had been vague . And that made Mistress Frances suspicious too , for she knew the Queen to be much too clever in money matters as to ignore the question of the bridegroom 's financial resources . Her silence on the point suggested that Thomas had more promise than present means , but , of course , he would be much better off after his marriage to her . " He 's a young man who 's expressed a most gratifying interest in becoming your husband , child . The family is well-enough off , and you shall not want for a new gown once a quarter , " the Queen had said , by way of laying the matter of Thomas ' money to rest . And so now she was sitting in her bedchamber in the palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided after the wedding to reside at Thorncombe . Frances was weary of the court but would have been content to live in London . It was Thomas who wanted to be a country squire . His head was full of plans for restoring the productivity of the land , for raising the tenants ' rent . Frances was not sure how he could stand to be deprived of his beloved theater , his elegant , witty friends , and his career in law . What prospects for advancement were there in dull Derbyshire ? But without a husband  --  and the right husband , too  --  Frances had no future in London . About her uncle 's death she had been discreet in her conversation with Thomas . The drowning was , after all , a thing of the past . A year gone might as well be a lifetime , especially to one like her who had seen only eighteen winters . The Queen had encouraged her reticence . " No use filling the young man 's head fullp153of horrors , especially when his thoughts should be on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwonted fit of enthusiasm for matrimony . " Let Matthew Stock resolve things in Derbyshire  --  if there 's anything to resolve . " She , too , had become more accepting of the coroner 's verdict . " And if he can not ? " Frances had asked , worrying not so much now about the defeat of justice as how a murderer at large might put a damper on her honeymoon . " Should it fall out so , " said the Queen , " it would be well to leave it all in God 's hands . " Her Majesty had mumbled something in addition to this pious thought . Something about a wager . And she seemed very pleased about something . But Frances supposed none of that pertained to her . She thanked the Queen for her goodness and sought permission to leave the royal presence and service . The Queen granted permission for both and kissed Frances on the forehead with cool , dry lips . " Pray come see me once more before you depart for the north . " Frances promised she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsequiousness , backed away from the royal presence , and then stood and turned , threading her way through the ranks of hangers-on and courtiers , servingmen and ladies . She went to her bedchamber . Earlier , she had directed Susan Harwood , her own maid , to pack her belongings for the journey . Susan , a round-hipped , raven-haired girl of Frances ' own age , had at least begun the task . The chests were open in the center of the chamber . One seemed fully loaded ; from the other , various items of clothing dangled , as though tossed there from a distance . Susan , at the moment of Frances ' entrance , was primping before the looking glass , striking seductive poses and pinching her cheeks to make them ruddier . All this , Frances suspected , designed for the brood of lecherous cooks and scullions with whom Susan kept riotous company . Frances continued to watch these antics with amusement , then adopted a more serious mien and cleared her throat to herald her return . Susan quickly gave over her posturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an abashed expression of one caught in the act . Frances decided to let the scolding Susanp154deserved pass and settled for a cold , censorious regard and sarcastic query : " Not yet finished , When you are , perhaps you will be at leisure to pack my clothing . And properly . " " I was only resting , ma'am . " " Well , you have rested enough , " Frances said curtly . " Just thank God you are not maid to Mary Throgbottom , whose wardrobe is fivefold mine and her patience less . " Mary Throgbottom was another Maid of Honor . She shared the chamber with Frances and had a reputation among the lower servants of being a tyrant . Susan resumed packing while Frances watched . Frances envied her servant 's buxomness , her smooth skin , short stature , and untrammeled lust . When Susan was finished , Frances inspected all that her servant had done and then told her to go find Jasper Prince and tell him she was ready to have her chests taken below . When Susan had gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her journey . She would not be traveling alone . She would be attended by Susan , by jasper Prince ( Thomas Cooke 's personal servant ) , and William Wallace , whose services had been procured by Thomas Cooke as footman and bodyguard . Then , since no young woman of good breeding and fortune could travel unaccompanied by a social equal or relative , that charge had been given to Priscilla , , Holmes . Priscilla was Frances ' best friend . A  --  pleasant woman of about twenty-five , Priscilla was of middle height , had a round , cheerful face , and winsome gray eyes . She had been widowed two years before and had recently remarried a man twenty-five years her senior . Her status as a married woman with a reputable husband thus qualified her as a suitable chaperone . The party was to leave early the next morning , hence Frances ' concern that the packing be done expeditiously . Priscilla , a newlywed herself , was delighted by the opportunity to give advice to Frances about her impending marriage . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frances received the benefit of Priscilla Holmes ' experience . Indeed , Priscilla spoke so explicitly of the pains and pleasures of the marriage bed that Frances felt herself flush along the throat and up to the very roots of her flaxen hair , while her heart burned inp155anticipation of the handsome young man with whom she would share these delights . " Young men are very eager , " Priscilla observed candidly . " They do not always allow for a virgin 's bashfulness by mitigating their first thrusts . " Frances had reflected a moment on her friend 's comment . Then she had said , " I am sure Thomas will be gentle with me  --  as gentle as a dove . " In making her comment she was also thinking of Priscilla 's present husband , whom Frances had met . An old man  --  fifty if he was a day . Was he gentle with his young wife ? Worse , was he fully capable of being otherwise ? She had heard it was often so with men of later years . Especially those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotence . What did it mean to be old ? Surely , at best , it meant wrinkled skin and flatulence , a drooling mouth , missing teeth , waning virility . Frances could not understand how her friend could be happy with a graybeard for a mate and accept her lot with such equanimity . Priscilla seemed to read Frances ' thoughts . " Henry is a very gentle , patient man . My first husband was hot-blooded and amorous . He pleased me well  --  I wo n't be hypocritical and deny it . But he swore violently and drank overmuch and  --  " Priscilla paused . Frances leaned forward with intensified interest in this catalog of vices . " And , " Priscilla continued , " he was unfaithful to me . " It was the worst of Frances ' own fears . Her heart sank . If her winsome companion and friend could not hold her husband to fidelity , what chance did Frances have  --  especially with a husband so attractive to women as Thomas Cooke ? " Henry gives me what my first husband did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women fell silent , too good friends for such silence to be a breach of good manners . This talk of marital fidelity had further undermined Frances ' confidence . The fear of betrayal enforced her low opinion of her own attractiveness . Was Thomas only marrying her for her money ? She could hardly imagine in her present state of mind another motive , and to her shame she began to weep.  |p156Frances  ' tears alarmed her friend . " Beshrew me for all this talk of pain and faithlessness , " Priscilla said . " What a fool I am to speak to you thusly , especially when you have so much to fret of  --  our long journey as well . " Frances assured Priscilla that she would be all right soon . It was only a passing mood , these tears . Such tear-storms brides-to-be sometimes fell afoul of as they contemplated the demands of their wedding day . To cheer her , Priscilla told a joke about a certain bishop , whose scandalous behavior was at the time the theme of every court gossip . Frances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot about her fears of Thomas ' motives , just as she had put behind her her preoccupation with her uncle 's death . But the night she was to travel to Derbyshire to take possession of her inheritance , she had a disturbing dream . She had never been to Thorncombe , but her mother had told her of it , and she had enough of an image in her mind to furnish forth a dream of the place . She was walking near her uncle 's lake , which was in her dream hardly more than a pond with pale , clear water and surrounded with shrubs and flowers like the work of Her Majesty 's careful gardeners at Whitehall . Above her , great billowy clouds floated like housewives ' sheets blowing in a March wind and white birds skimmed across the water , laving their wingtips by sudden dips . Watching these things , she felt very free and happy , unburdenedfrom worries and fears and proud that she was the mistress of such a place . She turned to include the castle in her view . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient and very grand in appearance  --  a domicile an earl might have boasted of . As she continued to marvel at the noble edifice , it seemed to grow larger , its wings , towers , and stories multiplying until she thought that Sir Robert Cecil 's magnificent mansion at Theobalds was a mere gatekeeper 's lodge by comparison . But then a sudden frisson of fear passed over her . The birds that had been singing a moment before suddenly disappeared . The sky darkened and the billowy clouds that had seemed like housewives ' sheets turned into great black thunderheads . The clear water of the lake now appeared to be dismal and thick . Looking around her forp157the cause of this transformation , she suddenly felt something grip her ankle . Startled , she looked down and saw that she was standing near the edge of the water and what had shot up therefrom with such suddenness to fasten an iron grip upon her was the mottled and maggoty arm and hand of a rotting corpse . She woke herself with her own scream ringing in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of a very angry Mary Throgbottom , bent over her like a snarling gargoyle and saying , " You stupid girl . Quiet ! You were having a dream , nothing more . Go back asleep . Another outburst and we shall have the guard streaming in to gawk at us in our nightclothes . You 'll wake the entire palace . " Mary Throgbottom returned to her own side of the bed , her back to Frances . Frances lay with her hand tight over her mouth to stifle her sobbing . Ashamed of her tears and her scream , Frances knew she deserved Mary 's censure . But what else could she have done ? Never had she had such a dream ! And the worst was what the dream might portend , for she held it sound doctrine that a nocturnal vision of such vividness and strangeness could not be without meaning . She lay quaking until dawn , listening to Mary 's soft breathing and thinking terrible thoughts about putrefying corpses . When dawn broke at last , she was much too grateful for the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now would be tired during the long first day of her journey to Thorncombe . She was dressing when she noticed the pale flesh of her delicate ankle bore an ugly bruise . As though what she had dreamed had been no dream at all.  |p158After  breakfast , Moll sent her husband down to the lakeside to look for a variety of edible mushrooms that grew in the moist earth along the shore . When he did not return right away , she was neither vexed nor surprised . The truth was that she did not care a fig for mushrooms . She only wanted to get Cuth out of the way for a while . Accustomed as she had been to the run of the castle , her present confines in the run-down lodge made a difficult problem of adjustment . She also missed the command she had enjoyed as chief servant in the castle . Now she had to content herself with ruling her husband , and he hardly began to gratify her passion for control and manipulation . Slow and deliberate , he seemed always in her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doddering and long heavy sighs and tedious reminiscences of life at Thorncombein the days when the master spent ten of the twelve months in Ireland . Moll often made up errands for Cuth to attend to , just to get him out from underfoot . The mushroom expedition was such a one . And yet , whenCuth was gone , Moll found the cottage lonely . Especially since thedeath of the worthy Nebuchadnezzar , whom she continued tomourn as she might have mourned the loss of a beloved child . She had not given up her desire for revenge on Joan Stock , who she was sure was to blame for the death . Yet she had yet top159determine a punishment worthy of the crime . She would not have been satisfied with direct action . What was needed was something devious , something spectacularly clever and monumental . She wanted , in short , not only the punishment of the wrongdoer but a personal triumph of which she might boast to her husband and others for the rest of her life . Since Joan 's arrival , Moll had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first week at the castle had been profoundly gratifying to the old woman but had fallen short of complete satisfaction in not having been terminal . More recently she had been disappointed in finding Joan a competent housekeeper , for Moll had intended to ask for restoration of rank on the grounds of Joan 's failure to control the Irish bitches , as Moll was wont to term ungraciously the castle 's maids . But no failure was evident , nor could it be easily falsified . The house and castle were efficiently and properly being made ready as ordered . The Irish girls seemed to work more willingly for the Stock woman thin for Moll . In sum , there simply were no chinks in the armor of Joan Stock 's adequacy . Obviously another course of action had to be taken . And Moll was in the middle of contemplating what that course might be when she heard her husband 's voice outside the lodge , bawling out her name . Moll hardly had time to rise from her stool to see what the matter was before Cuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her strangely and said , " By God , Moll , you killed the Irish bastard after all ! " She was too bewildered by this proclamation to he angry . " Why , what is it you say , husband ? An Irish bastard ? What ! Is one of the maids with child , say you ? " Cuth was clutching his chest , trying to get his breath . He started to speak again and then fell helpless in a fit of coughing and gagging so that Moll had to press a cup of water on him to clear his throat . " Conroy , the Irishman . " He sat down on a bench in front of her and put his elbows on his knees and stuck out his face . He looked at Moll with eyes full of wonder , as though he had never truly understood this woman to whom he had been married for over forty years . " Cold , stone dead . Like Aileen Mogaill ! His throat wasp160cut . From ear to ear . Old girl , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really do . " " Fool ! " Moll said . " What makes you think I killed him ? " The question took Cuth aback . He had no immediate response . Then he said , " I thought you hated him for his insolence . " " And so I did , " she said . " And so I might have brained him with my cudgel at hand , or taken a kitchen knife to his privates , if it had struck my fancy . Marry , he would have richly deserved neutering . But the bald fact of the matter is that I did n't do it . " She wanted to know where her husband had discovered the body . " I went even as you said , down by the lake where the willow arches over the bank . I saw something afloat there and wondered what it was . Thought it was a huge fish , I did . No , it was n't a fish . I thought then it might be a log or a dead sheep . " " Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to stanch the flow of useless words . " He was floating face down . " With mordant relish , Cuth gave another gruesome description of the dead man 's wounds . She stopped him in midsentence . " He was plainly murdered then , and like Aileen ? " " Nothing but murder makes such wounds , " Cuth said , nodding as though his knowledge of these bloody matters were extensive . " No chance of it being self-slaughter ? " Her husband laughed grimly and shook his head . " Selfslaughter ! Him ? Why , he was too mean . He would never have given the world so much pleasure . " She had to admit he was right on that score . " Well then , " he demanded , looking at her curiously . " If it was n't you that did it , who did ? " It was the very thing she was wondering herself . And the first person she thought of was Joan Stock . Not because she reasoned that whoever would murder feline innocence would not stint at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that whoever would murder a harmless cat deserved to be blamed for killing an Irishman , guilty or not . " The Stock woman murdered him , that 's who , " she said decisively . " Murdered him in cold blood . With ill intent andp161motive malicious . It was because of some quarrel the two of them had . " " Did she ? " gasped Cuth . His jaw fell slack . For a moment he was speechless . As an alternative to his wife , the hostler had struck him as a likely candidate . He had not even thought of Joan Stock  --  or her husband either . Moll warmed to her theme . " Did you not hear the quarrel the two of them had  --  what threats were exchanged and bloody oaths uttered ? What weapons were brandished on both sides ! " " No , I did n't . You told me  --  " " Foolish old man , " Moll interrupted , glaring at him threateningly . " You did hear such a quarrel and were a privy witness to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But I do n't remember  --  " " You do remember , " Moll repeated . And then Cuth understood what he was to say if he was asked . He envisioned the quarrel she spoke of  --  and to which he was supposed to have been an eavesdropper  --  with startling clarity and conviction . He nodded in agreement . He approved of his wife 's plan . Besides , he was eager to see her have her revenge . It would put the matter of the dead cat to rest , once and for all . " Where 's Conroy 's body now ? " she asked . " Where I left it . Beached , fly-blown , and rotting in the sun . " " Go hide it so that no one tampers with the remains . At least until our constable 's had an eyeful . Then go find Edward . Tell him there 's been another murder done and the Stock woman did it . Tell him there 's a world of proof . Say her husband was her accomplice . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he inquires as to the cause , say it was because the Irishman spoke uncivilly to them and would not willingly forsake the house . " Cuth rushed back to where he had found Conroy 's body . He was greatly relieved , now that he thought of it , that his wife had not murdered the man . For one thing , he would have been tolerably sorry to see his wife hanged . For another , her murder of Conroy would have set a worrisome precedent . For certainly she would murder him next if she ever found out it was he that had dispatched Nebuchadnezzar . Cuth trusted the hostler would keep his little secret as he had promised , since Cuth had promised in turn to keepp162mum about Edward 's Irish whore . Tit for tat it was to he between the two men . But when he came to where he had left the corpse he found it gone . He looked about him in a panic . There was the same willow . The same overhanging branches , the same clump of sedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! For a moment a supernatural dread seized him . Into his confused imagination came a parade of horrors  --  bloated corpses that walked , skeletons that danced . Or perhaps Conroy had not been dead after all . But then he remembered the half-severed head . No , not even the Irishman could have survived such a wound . He backed away from the spot , afraid to take his eyes from the water . His old heart beat so violently against his chest he could n't catch his breath . When he had walked backward a good dozen paces and had come near breaking his neck stumbling over stones and roots , he turned and broke into a frenzied dash for the lodge again , bellowing out his wife 's name as though he were a child come running home to Mother with a skinned knee . " Now do n't piss yourself , but tell inc what it is , " she said . " He 's gone . " " Who ? " " Conroy . " " You said he was dead . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irishmen . " " Then he only seemed to he dead , " she said . Moll 's heart sank as her plot began to crumble before her mind 's eye . " Nay , he was dead . If not by his wounds , then by the water . " " Well , then , Master Know-It-All , " Moll asked scornfully , " pray tell me where he has gone . To find a grave digger ? " Her husband had no answer . Moll snorted with disgust and stood elbows akimbo as she often did when she was thinking . Here indeed was a puzzling turn of events . A disappearing body ! She believed her husband 's description of the wounds . She knew her husband was an ass , but surely too poor a liar to fabricate a story in such a wealth of detail . Yet she held it as a matter of principle that no man with his throat cut walks away . So someone must have discovered the body and borne it off . She knew they must act quickly now or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what you saw and what we suspect . Then let him go to the house and confront the housekeeper and the steward . If she claims ignorance of any bodies or murders , then we 'll accuse her of murder all the same and say she did away with the body herself so as not to he caught red-handed ; just as she and her husband did with Aileen Mogaill  --  and contrary to our better judgment , too , for we urged them to fetch the constable when the wretched girl was found , but they would rely on their own wisdoms . " " Why , that 's true , Moll , " Cuth said enthusiastically . " If she murdered Conroy , she might with equal logic conceal his corpse . And ' t was her husband and Edward that buried Aileen huggermuggerand without a priest to bless her bones . " " Let her deny it , let her deny it ! " Moll cried . " I 'll say I saw Conroy floating in his gore  --  that we went down to the shore together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body . We 'll match stories . That 's two ' gainst one . " " But what if her husband stands by her ? " Cuth said . " There 's two against two . " " And so it is , husband . An even match . Yet we 'll come out on top because Conroy wo n't be around and where else could he he but dead ? Besides , we 're natives to the place , the Stocks strangers . If it 's to he them against us , then we 'll prevail . " Cuth felt bolstered by his wife 's confidence . Pleased to have such a clever wife , he hurried toward the stable to find the hostler , rehearsing , as he ran , everything his wife had instructed him to say . Edward was in the paddock , grooming one of the horses . Cuth rushed up and told his story , but the hostler seemed unimpressed . " Floating in his gore ? " he replied incredulously . " Nonsense , surely . The man was hale and hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Left ? " Cuth exclaimed in amazement , thinking of the bloated corpse he had seen . " He and his horse and his gear . He did n't say where he went or when he 'd be back , but he took everything with him and 1 judge thereby he 's gone for good . " " But the Stocks murdered him , slit his throat and gutted him too , because he would not quit the house , " Cuth protested , his panic rising again.  | " But the man has quit the house  --  and probably the country as well . By all signs , he 's gone back to Ireland . The Stocks would have no cause to murder , and I saw the roan alive just this morning . " Cuth walked out of the paddock in total and devastating confusion . He was sure what he had seen  --  or at least he thought he was sure . But the worst was that he now had to return to tell Moll , who would hardly be pleased to learn that her stratagem of revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear and trembling , and with a vague , distant expression on his face . As soon as he crossed the threshold , he told his wife what the hostler had said . " Left this morning  --  quit the country ? " She sat there looking at him , trying to piece things together herself . Then in her eyes came the gleam of recognition . " Why , you dolt ! Left this morning ! You fell asleep by the lake instead of bringing me my mushrooms and then made up a story of a corpse to cover your own sloth ! Napping , were you ? And dreaming too , I warrant . Bloody corpses ! I 'll make you a bloody corpse , I will . " Moll seized her broom and gave Cuth a few good whacks before he managed to dodge out of her way . She drove him out-of-doors , where he remained the rest of the day , while in her solitude the enraged old woman studied other means to avenge the worthy Nebuchadnezzar . The two men walked quickly toward the stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their common interest yet to establish itself . Stafford 's hostler went to bring out his master 's favorite mount ; Stafford remained at the paling to think about his wife and his future riches . When Wylkin returned , Stafford made mention of the Challoner treasure . He said he wanted a report of Wylkin 's progress , a report of his espionage at the castle . Stafford 's request gave Wylkin a chance to announce offhandedlythat he had discovered where the same treasure was hidden . The effect of his nonchalance was a thing of beauty , according to Wylkin 's view of things . For a moment Stafford just stood there by his horse , his mouth agape , his face wrinkled up in puzzlement , as though he had lost his hearing  --  or kept it and Wylkin had lost his mind.  | " What did you say , Jack ? " " I said , sir , I 've found out where old Challoner hid the booty . " " Why , speak , man ; my God , if this be true , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , Wylkin told of his most recent meeting with Una , of Joan Stock 's spying , of his own increased suspicions of Matthew Stock . He told how he searched the castle grounds looking for the new steward and how he found instead Conroy ( although the Irishman did not see him ) , drawing a boat from its hiding place in a thicket and rowing out onto the lake with only a bold-faced moon for a lantern . Wylkin had watched from shore until his suspicions were confirmed . Conroy 's destination was clearly the island . " The island ! " Stafford exclaimed . " Why , I should have thought of it before this . Beshrew me , I should have known  --  and yes , you , too , Jack . What better hiding place ? Tricky devil , that Challoner . God knows when he started planning this . Why , he must have built that cursed lake to protect the treasure , which even then he must have been hoarding . " Stafford was beside himself with happiness . He said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the house to inform his wife . The news would be as welcome to her as it was to him , he said . But then Stafford looked very seriously at Wylkin and said , " My God , you do n't think Conroy found the treasure and then made off with it , do you ? " " Believe me , the booty is still on the island , " Wylkin said . " I feel it in my bones . I waited for his return to shore , a lonely vigil , but he brought nothing home that he had not taken abroad on the lake . " " But why has n't Conroy found it ? " Stafford said . " He has n't found it yet , sir . " " By which you mean we must find it first . " " Exactly . " " But I ca n't swim  --  shall we walk on water ? " " We shall go dry-shod , " said Wylkin , supremely confident . " Dry-shod ? " " Mark my words . " Wylkin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasureand destroy the Challoner pride in one fell stroke.  |p166Matthew  and Joan lay long abed the next morning , both drifting in and out between sleep and wakefulness , while the timid November sunlight filtered through the curtains and in the lower regions of the house footsteps and distant voices could be heard , signaling that the Irish maids were already at their appointed tasks . Joan 's first words when she was fully awake and saw that Matthew was likewise was a request that he tell her again of his night 's adventure . She said she had been too overwhelmed with weariness when he returned to hear him all out , and what she remembered she could not now be sure was fact or dream . Matthew told it all again , while a strange torpor seized him . " Digging by lamplight . A sinister work indeed , " she observed when he told her that part . " And not burying , " he said . " Nor finding ? " she inquired . " No . I saw him leave the tower . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , " We could put it to him that you saw him . That we know . " " Poor bait for the larger truth , " Matthew said . " He 'd deny everything , or concoct some fantastical fiction . " Joan thought of the lake , so dismal and treacherous with its166p167submerged stumps , its murky water , and God knew what creatures in its depths . She shuddered and looked at her husband , wondering at his hardihood  --  indeed , at his incredible bullheadedness , for she had reminded him before he left of her glimmering . Had it not betokened grave peril ? But now that she looked at his face , she realized he did not look well at all . Against the pillow his face was drawn and flushed , his eyes lusterless . He sneezed violently . " Well , now , " she said . " See , you have caught your death . " A second sneeze , more violent than the first , prevented his reply . He groaned and shut his eyes . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered him to remain in his bed . He protested and tried to rise , but fell back down again . He felt a fever coursing through his blood . His muscles ached , especially those in the calves and thighs , which had borne the brunt of his labors . " Conroy must be watched , " he said weakly . " If his digging has n't something to do with these strange murders , then I 'm no Englishman . " " You are as true an Englishman as ever walked the earth , " she said , very sorry to see him so unstrung . She felt his forehead and listened to his chest . He was burning up . She heard a definite wheezing about his heart and lungs . She smelled his breath . It was sour . And in addition to all these untoward symptoms she could detect about his body the rank odor of the lake . Alarmed , she said , " I 'll be your nurse , as you were mine . You have made your last voyage to the island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went downstairs , and prepared a concoction of herbs and spices she had learned from her mother for the curing of colds and other distempers . It was a remedy of proven virtue , and yet Joan knew the best remedy was rest . Then she went back upstairs , gave him several spoonfuls , and sat by the bedside until he fell asleep again . She watched him for some time , and while she watched she thought of Conroy and Una and Edward , of Jack Wylkin and his master , of poor Aileen Mogaill , and of the chest she had found byp168the lake and about Matthew 's excursion to the island . All swirled in her head with their competing claims for significance . Matthew seemed better . She felt his forehead . It was cooler , his breathing more regular . She decided the investigation must continue . She thought that despite what Matthew had said about the unlikelihood of Conroy confessing anything , it would be of some value to see what the Irishman was up to . She went downstairs and then out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his workbench and asked him if he 'd seen Conroy . The hostler paused in his work . He was in the midst of repairing a saddle and had a sharply pointed tool in his hand . He looked at her and said , " He 's gone . " " Where ? " " Where he willed , " Edward answered , returning his attention to the saddle . " He 's cleared out . Go have a look for yourself . " She decided that under the circumstances the invitation was well worth accepting . Joan slipped around Edward and into the stable where Matthew had told her Conroy slept . Despite the hostler 's assurance that Conroy had cleared out , she expected to see the chaotic mess that had characterized Conroy 's quarters in the castle . Instead , the little room was well ordered and clean . The straw pallet had been covered with a piece of new canvas . There was no sign of the Irishman 's gear . She was turning to leave when she noticed a large dark stain on the planks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever had spilled had been in ample supply , and someone had made a serious effort to clean it up , for there were abrasive marks all around the edge of the stain , as though the floor had been scrubbed hard with a thick-bristled brush . " I noticed a stain on the floor . Something spilled , " she commented to Edward as she was on her way out . " The floor is filthy with stains , " the hostler said without looking up . " Most of it blood . Animal blood . My father tells me the cabin was once used to slaughter chickens and pigs . " " Oh , was it ? " Joan responded casually , as if the hostler 's explanation was of no importance to her . A slaughterhouse for chickens and pigs ? she thought as shep169walked back to the house . Who would believe that a stable room with a solid wood floor would be used to butcher beasts  --  a filthy work all the world did out-of-doors ? And , moreover , who could believe , knowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute of his time cleaning quarters he had never sought and was on the edge of abandoning forever ? The only conclusion to be drawn was that Edward was lying . But if Conroy really had cleared out for good , why did n't Edward simply tell the truth ? And then she wondered if perhaps he had n't  --  at least in part . Perhaps the stain was blood . But no animal 's . She shuddered . She reasoned that if Edward was lying , then it was his second lie , for she recalled Matthew 's account of the hidden child . She wondered if Conroy might be dead and if Edward had killed him and had then cleaned up after the murder . The silly story about the slaughterhouse might have been invented on the spur of the moment . Perhaps he thought no one would see the stain , or attach any significance to it . If so , Edward had woefully underestimated her housewife 's eye for details . She went upstairs again to see how Matthew was doing . Finding him still asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to decide what to do next . When Matthew awoke she told him what Edward had said . " Gone ! I ca n't believe it . He would n't go save he found what he was looking for , I 'm convinced of it . " She had to agree . She told him she thought Conroy might be dead . Murdered . Perhaps by Edward . " But why would Edward kill the Irishman ? " he asked . " I must get up . " " No , you do n't . Keep to your bed . You 're not well , and while I think you are mending , if you do too much you 'll make it worse again . I 'll be back in a little while . " " Where are you going ? " " Out to see Edward 's father  --  and perhaps Edward 's child . " " No , wait until I 'm well enough to accompany you . " " We ca n't wait . Things are happening too fast , Matthew . " He protested futilely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage from Matthew 's description , which had been very exact . As she approached , she saw an old man seated in the doorway sunning himself . At his feet sprawled a large dog . Indoors , a woman 's voice was singing . The dog , catching her scent , stood and began to bark . The singing stopped . Joan advanced quickly , maneuvering around the man and the dog , who she could see was tied to a stake and was at the end of his tether and beyond reaching her . Joan 's foot was on the doorstep when the woman appeared , a startled expression on her face . She was in her early twenties , Joan supposed . With fair skin and dark hair , full on her shoulders . She was holding her hand over her mouth in a gesture of surprise . Joan greeted the woman , identified herself , and stepped into the cottage , as though the younger woman 's astonishment at Joan 's sudden appearance had been a clear invitation to enter . Not certain as to how long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan took in as much as there was to see . She noticed the interior was simply furnished , and , as Matthew had said , clean . She saw the baby at once . Joan judged it to be about a year of age , perhaps more . It was lying on its stomach on one of the two pallets , its round pale face protruding from a coarse-spun blanket . The child was asleep . Joan turned from the child to look at its mother . The woman had come into the center of the room and wore an expression of confusion and dismay . Joan noticed , now that she could study the woman 's features , that they were delicate and winsome , the eyes wide-set and the mouth small and well-shaped . The woman still seemed too astonished by Joan 's invasion of the cottage to speak . Taking advantage of her confusion , Joan turned to have a closer look at the child . The child 's coloring favored the mother . There was a thick growth of ruddy hair on the smooth scalp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was a deformity in the mouth that marred the little face . It was a harelip , a lamentable defect . Somehow sensing his mother 's alarm , the child awoke and stared up at Joan and began to wail . The baby 's distress brought the mother hurrying to the bed . She snatched the child up in her arms , putting the blanket over the lower part of the child 's face to hide the deformity.  |p171Joan  decided to be direct . " Who are you ? And who , pray , is this child ? " " The child is mine , " the woman said in a heavy Irish accent . " He 's my son . My name is Brigid . " " You are Edward 's wife , then ? " Joan said . Brigid paused before answering ; then she said , " No , not his wife . " " But that is his child , " Joan said . In the comforting embrace of its mother , the child had ceased crying and was watching Joan out of large blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about the child 's paternity , Joan 's attention was drawn to the yard , where the dog had resumed barking . This time , however , the quality of the bark had changed from fierce aggression to excited welcome . Joan heard a familiar voice . " Stand , Dagger . Peace , cur ! " The next moment Edward appeared , stern-visaged and breathing hard , as if he had run in pursuit of her . " What 's your business here , Mistress Stock ? " he inquired coldly . She was tempted to answer in kind  --  to say that she had every right to be where she was and to demand what right the woman and child had to be under a roof that was property of Thorncombe without the owner 's permission . But then , remembering that a soft answer turned away wrath , she said , " I came to visit your father . And this young woman . And her child . " This response seemed to take Edward by surprise . He appeared less angry now and came deeper into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit my father ? " he asked suspiciously . " You told me he was old . And infirm . I thought it within the scope of my duties  --  if not an obligation of a Christian . " " My father needs nothing that I can not provide , " Edward said defensively . He looked down at the baby in Brigid 's arms as though to see if it was all right and then back at Joan . His face was full of resolve . " This woman and I are betrothed . If our union has not yet been blessed by the Church , yet it has been blessed by this child , who is truly ours . " " It 's a fine , healthy child , " Joan agreed , not sure how to respond to this speech and its note of defiance . " But I don'tp172understand , Edward , why you have been so secretive  --  about Brigid , I mean , and your son . Certainly there is no cause of shame here . You did say you were betrothed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie he had told Matthew . But she was still not unconvinced that the hostler 's handsome countenance was not a murderer 's , for there was still the matter of the bloodstain on the stable floor . " Well , " Edward said , " some might not approve of our living as husband and wife before our union has been blessed . I 'm of no mind to have my son called a bastard . " Joan thought that was a good enough reason . If the pair were n't married by law , then it followed that the child was a bastard by the same law , despite the dubious " bed-rights " often claimed by betrothed couples and sanctioned by their families . Yet the word " bastard " had a sting to it , and she could see another reason for Edward 's secrecy . Since it was common thinking that bastards wore the outward sign of their illegitimacy on their bodies , it was sure that the child 's harelip would be construed as a curse and stigma . " Bastard is a hard name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure your little son is as innocent as any other child . As for your unmarried but housed condition , I will be no hypocrite and say that I completely approve . Yet I will be no judge of you . " Edward 's hard manner seemed to soften at these words . " Thank you , Mistress Stock . We did n't know how you and your husband might think . The old steward and his wife cast Brigid off when she was great with child . We keep to ourselves here , as you can see . Dagger is n't used to company . " " I could see that well enough , " Joan said good-naturedly . " Yet a dog that does not bark is hardly worth what it takes to feed him . " Brigid smiled and put her baby back down on the bed . Edward said , " We 'd be obliged if you did n't say anything about the baby at the castle . " " As you please , " she answered . " It 's your business  --  yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I and my husband are concerned . " Then Joan said it was time she must be going . She explained that her husband was taken ill . Both Brigid and Edward expressed their sympathy . They said they hoped he would be himself again soon . They waved to her as she left.  |p173The  old man was still in the yard . Unmoved since her arrival , he now lifted up pale , watery eyes in her direction as she passed , and the dog , having accepted her status as an invited guest , was too busy scratching its fleas to take note of her departure . She was disappointed that the mystery of the crying child was so easily explained  --  and more disappointed that the explanation cast no greater light on what the child might have to do with the castle murders . Matthew had been awake since his wife left , thinking he really should get up , imagining that while he languished recuperating , events of great moment were taking place of which he was woefully ignorant . And so get up he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , despite Joan 's remedies and compresses . Still in ill sorts , he knew he had paid the price for his foolhardiness . He could see that now  --  and Joan had seen it too and therefore had spared him the scolding his foolhardiness warranted . He felt not only physically weak , but morally chastened . But what lay heaviest upon his mind and heart was a sense of failure . In London the Queen and Sir Robert would be waiting his return . But when he did , what could he report  --  a second mysterious murder and perhaps a third to add to the first he had been charged with solving ? The Queen would hardly be pleased . She would forget his great service at Bartholomew Fair , perhaps even demand the return of the silk purse and its contents on the grounds that it had been earnest money for greater service promised and yet unperformed . Matthew knew the Queen to be a canny businesswoman . Yes , would she not have the purse back ? And there was Sir Robert , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecil 's too . And with that thought , Matthew slid even further into a slough of despondency . He went over to the casement and looked out . How long had Joan been gone ? To the cottage of Edward 's father . That had been her destination . He wondered what she would find . Perhaps the concealed child . And the reason for the concealment ? He turned at the sound of her voice . " The child is one of the maids ' , " she said without prologue . " She lives with Edward . They 're betrothed. "  | " Not Una ? " Matthew asked , imagining for the moment the triangular complexities of Una , Wylkin , and Edward . " The girl 's name is Brigid . She was once a servant here but was sent away when found with child . By the Fludds , or so says Edward . " " Cast the maid off because she was undone by another servant ! " Matthew exclaimed , disapprovingly , climbing back into bed and folding his hands beneath his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half the houses in England would he untenanted by servants . Besides , they are betrothed . Some say that gives bedrights . Whence comes this moral severity on the old couple 's part ? Neither strikes me as a Puritan . " Joan took off her cap and cloak and sat down on the bed beside Matthew . She asked him how he did and he said he felt better , much better . " Liar . Stay in bed , " she said . She addressed his question . " With people as bad-tempered as the Fludds , there 's no great mystery . I imagine Brigid got on the wrong side of Moll . The girl is quite beautiful really . Her features are unusually fine for a country girl 's . " " Jealousy , then ? " " Envy , spite , the cankered nature of the awful old woman , " Joan said . " When Brigid 's folly began to betray itself in the swelling of her belly , they asked her to leave , and Edward took her in . Took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child and his father . He did n't want you to know she was there because he was afraid you 'd send her packing , just as the Fludds did . But they trust us now to keep their secret . " " And so we shall , " Matthew said . Joan told her husband too about the child 's deformity , the little red fissure dividing the upper lip and marring the otherwise flawless countenance . " Our grave divines and moralists would make much of that , " Matthew said , shaking his head sadly , for he loved children and felt a natural sympathy with other parents who were protective of their little ones . " There remains one cause of suspicion about Edward , " Joan reminded him . " The bloodstained floor . "  | " Well , " Matthew said . " However that is explained , I 'll believe Conroy dead when I see his body for myself . But if he is dead we may never know what he was looking for on the island , or why he killed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Perhaps it was in the chest , " Joan suggested . " The empty chest I found . " " Perhaps , " he agreed . For a moment each thought his or her own thoughts . Then Matthew said , " Conroy may have misunderstood Sir John 's intention  --  aboutthe island , I mean . Maybe he thought that because Sir John was in his boat he was setting out for there . But maybe the island was n't in the man 's thought at all . " " What do you mean , husband , not in his thought ? " " I mean , maybe he wanted to row out to the center of the lake and give whatever it was he had with him a toss into the water and let it sink to the bottom . " " Something that he may have carried with him in the chest I found ? " " It is possible , " said Matthew . Joan considered this , for her husband 's new speculation had its appeal . It made sense of the chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baronet have been so eager to throw away on the night of his homecoming ? The larger , more compelling question remained unanswered . " Well , " she said with a heavy sigh , " much good whatever he cast off will do us or Conroy now . Unless the lake goes dry . " " Would we could drain the pestilent thing . " " Could the lake be drained ? " she asked , thinking suddenly that what man had made could be unmade . " Mistress Frances would hardly approve , " he said . " All of what we 've said is guesswork . How could we justify it to her ? Could we say : Madam , your honorable uncle concealed some unknown thing beneath the lake waters  --  something for which we suppose the good man might have been murdered , although we have not a jot of proof of the same . We humbly request your permission to  --  " She conceded the point , indicating with a bob of her head and a wry smile that he need not proceed further with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thorncombe 's new mistress . The implication that some disgraceful revelation wouldp176follow upon the discovery of whatever had been cast away and since hunted for so covertly by Conroy was too grossly palpable . They had been commissioned to find a murder , not expose a family scandal . " No , the Challoners are a proud race , " Matthew said . " Only if Mistress Frances ' curiosity is greater than her sense of family honor would she consent to such an undertaking . " " Or her passion for truth , should curiosity fail , " Joan said . But both Joan and Matthew knew that neither truth norcuriosity nor the two in consort would prevail over family honor . They seemed to have arrived at another impasse.  |p177That  night jack Wylkin made three trips from Stafford Halltothe dam , bearing on each trip two twenty-pound kegs of black powder hoisted on his shoulders like a peddler 's pack . He had secured the powder at no little expense and trouble from an unscrupulous captain who would sell anything for money ; but it was good-quality powder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these virtues to blow the darn to hell . He made the difficult journey on foot , for there was no horse trail , only the streambed with its puny trickle , sharp rocks , dead branches , and pits  --  all navigated with great difficulty because of a teasing moon that would appear and then disappear behind swollen clouds . But Wylkin performed his labor cheerfully and would not have complained even if he had had a companion to complain to . F'or already in his mind 's eye he could envision the catastrophe his labors would produce  --  an explosion of fire and smoke and a deafening noise that would release the contents of Cihalloner 's vile lake down their true and natural course , making accessible at the same time Challoner 's treasure isle . Wylkin contemplated this outcome with great pleasure . His motive was more than greed . He was an arsonist at heart . With the care of one long experienced in such work , he placedp178the kegs at intervals at the base of the dam to maximize the effect of the blasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reserve , concealing them in a shallow cave just above the darn . The dam had been well constructed but was in need of repair . Time had violated its integrity , and all along its foundations an ominous seepage could be detected . All of this was to the good , Wylkin thought . He took a length of fuse and linked the kegs , giving special attention to the fuse 's end , which he splayed into a downy tassel to improve its ignition capabilities . Then , as a precaution to premature discovery , he hid the kegs beneath loose rock and uprooted bushes . The plot , to his mind , had the simplicity of a child 's game ; for he was preparing for a special moment to come . He would set fire to the powder on the wedding night of the Challoner bride , when bride , bridegroom , and guests , besotted with wine and merriment , would be asleep , or , if by some miracle awake , think the blasts the roll of distant thunder . Thereafter , if Wylkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pierced carbuncle . Come daylight , Wylkin , his master , and other stout fellows secured for the service , would walk to the island and appropriate with impunity whatever treasure was concealed there , fair field and no favor . That arson was a capital crime meant nothing to Wylkin ; he would have received as severe a sentence for stealing a loaf of bread or a good round of cheese . An important element in his plan was Una , whom he required as accomplice in his demolitions , for through her he might learn at what moment it was safe to proceed . And for that reason he regretted now that he had lost his temper with her at their last interview . Reconciliation would be difficult , given his harsh words . He would have to resume the guise of the jolly wooer , swallow his hateful language as a bitter pill to a desirable end . Could it be done ? His growing excitement at the prospect of laying his hands on Challoner booty had given sexual conquest a lower priority than it normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stafford Hall , he had found Alice Stafford 's subtle hints and flirting tiresome . Had she offered herself to him stark-naked in her husband 's bed , with the air perfumed like a rose garden and thep179lascivious plunkings of a lute to accompany their coupling , still he would have leapt over her body to deliver the powder to its destination . He slept for a few hours on the hillside , with only his heavy cloak and cap for warmth , but he slept dreamlessly and without thought for the hard earth or the fearsome loneliness of the hills . When dawn came , he proceeded to the castle . He knew at this time of the morning Una would he in the kitchen . He lurked around the wellhouse until she came out on the kitchen porch and stood there in the crisp morning air shielding her eyes . Did she know he was there somehow ? He did n't wonder long . He whistled a string of notes they had agreed on as a signal . At once she lifted her head . He knew she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He showed himself briefly and then moved quickly back into the trees , trusting that she would follow . He walked for a dozen or more paces before looking behind him . When he turned he was not surprised to see her following , like a sheep following the bellwether . At their usual trysting place he stopped and watched her come through the trees toward him . He could see that her face was slightly altered in its expression . She seemed neither angry nor expectant , and this puzzled him . Suddenly he realized how much he despised her for her docility , and in so doing he remembered what he had called her  --  fool , stupid hitch , old woman  --  words that would have instilled undying hatred and loathing in a soul of any pluck , hateful words deserving no forgiveness in this world or the next . He greeted her uncertainly , watching her face . She returned the greeting and kept on coming until she threw her arms around his waist and kissed his cheek as though there had never been strong words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he not been so convinced that her pliancy was a testimony to the defect in female nature , he would have been more suspicious than he was . But he suspected nothing and immediately began to press on her his need for a trustworthy friend in a daring enterprise . He told her that their hour of opportunity had come , that soon the both of them would be rich and , yes , free to marry . She listened withoutp180expression or comment , staring at him as she might have stared at a perfect stranger . Sensing her sudden unresponsiveness and more than ever aware of how greatly he was in need of an ally at the castle , Wylkin stooped to beg her pardon for his ill-considered words during their last meeting . " Take it as Jack Wylkin 's anger , and not as Jack Wylkin himself . I was possessed of a terrible demon of choler . Forgive me for it . " Her lips curled into a thin smile ; she did not speak . " Still angry , are you ? I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with unfeigned urgency . " Your master 's treasure stands within our reach . But we must act in concert . " " What will you have me do ? " she asked . Taking her answer as a sign that greed was an adequate route to regaining her goodwill and cooperation , Wylkin now placed his plan before her in its fullness . " Of risk there is but little , " he said . " Only signal to me when the castle is asleep so that I may work my mischief in the greatest privacy and half my gain shall be yours . The best is that your part will never be known . " " But is the plan not dangerous ? " she said , still seeming reluctant . But the expression in her eyes had changed ; he had noticed that , and in the change he felt she was yielding . Hopeful , he cast his repentent manner aside and played the wooer again . " Come , " he said . " Say you will do it and we will seal the bargain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , looking up at him with mild eyes , " seal it with our bodies too ? " The smile came again . It was a smile he had not seen before . She seemed somehow a different woman and the novelty fired his lust . He reached out to grab the fullness of her body and was delighted when she yielded to him without further protest or reprimand . He kissed her neck and shoulders . She laughed a little as he took her , and this he interpreted as a sign of her pleasure in his lovemaking , for he could not imagine that she would have anything to mock . Una did not find her lovemaking with Jack Wylkin unpleasant , even though she had resolved to betray him . In her mind , he had now already received the reward for his treachery , and somehowp181they were even again , quite without his knowing it . Her love for the man had been displaced first by a desire for cruel revenge , and now by a kind of pity for one who stumbles forward in blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rendezvous had concluded and he had given her instruction , he kissed her good-bye and said , " When we meet again we will quarrel only as to which of us is the richer by this deed . " He told her to take care . " You are an engineer now , a soldier of the wars . Go into battle with a high heart . " She assured him that her heart had never been so high . She told him , too , savoring the irony of the double meaning , that she had him to thank for the joy she felt . He grinned with self-satisfaction at her words , and by his expression and general manner she knew he suspected nothing . What fools men are , she thought . How easily deceivers are themselves deceived . When he was out of her sight she went directly to the house and told the steward and housekeeper everything  --  about Stafford , about the treasure , and about Wylkin 's plan to discover and snatch the same while all were asleep . She asked forgiveness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her complicity with the man who now had earned her hatred . " A bold plot , " Joan exclaimed , astonished at the audacity of Stafford 's servant . Matthew echoed his wife 's sentiment . " Many thanks to you for revealing this . But tell me , for what reason would you betray your lover ? " Una 's eyes filled with tears . " He did not love me . He said hedid , but he loved only the treasure I was to bring him . " " I believe you , " Joan said , taking the Irishwoman 's hands . " And forgive you also . " Una went her way , beginning for the first time to regret a little what she had done . Yet she knew recanting was too late now . She scorned herself for her lack of resolve , but then she remembered what Wylkin had called her in his choleric fit and she realized his eager embraces and honeyed words had no more substance than breath upon cold glass.  |p182As  soon as Una had departed , Matthew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what use they might make of it . " So it is treasure then for which Conroy searched . " " Robbed from churches and Catholic households  --  a dishonorablekind of soldiery , if you ask me , " Matthew said . " So much for Sir John 's reputation  --  a thing of naught . " " The worst will be his failure to give the Queen her due , " Matthew added . " Which makes him traitor as well as brigand . Had this been known , he would have been tried and convicted for his crimes . He would have died upon the gibbet rather than drowned in the lake . " " Our immediate purpose should be to prevent Wylkin 's stratagem , " Joan said with resolve . " I 've been giving that some thought , " Matthew said . " Especiallyin light of our discussion yesterday . Why prevent him at all ? " " What ! Allow the man to drain the lake and find the treasure ? " Joan wondered if Matthew 's illness had not also affected his good judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " Husband , you confound me ! " Matthew laughed . " Think , Joan . Did we not lament that the lake could not be drained ? " " So we did . " " Consider this , then . Wylkin shall have his signal as he supposes , fire his powder , unleash the flood , but it is we who shall have the element of surprise . " " And Mistress Frances ' permission will not be sought . " " Nor needed , " he answered.  |p183It  was a warm day for so late in the year and the windows of the Privy Gallery at Whitehall stood open to let in the mild air . The Queen , dressed in a white taffeta gown lined with scarlet and ornamented with pearls and rubies , was seated in private conference with Master Secretary Cecil . In her lap was a little volume of Seneca , whose Stoic doctrines gave her much satisfaction in her days of pain and suffering . Her attendants , her Maids of Honor , stood at a respectful distance , for few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . During a long morning they had talked of weighty matters of state . She had talked , rather , for it was Cecil 's special wisdom to be ever the listener , to advance his own ideas with proper caution . This strategy the Queen well understood . And encouraged . For at her advanced age and in her weakened condition she was impatient with debate . In due course , their conversation came around to the Challonerdrowning , as Cecil was sure it would sometime before his dismissal . " The girl is gone from the court , you know , " the Queen said . " Off to be married to Thomas Cooke . Why , she must be inDerbyshire by now . And no word as yet from Constable Stock ? " " None , Majesty , " Cecil said regretfully . He took the liberty ofp184reminding his royal mistress of the terms of their wager . Stock had a month to discover the murderer and return . " We lack a good week or more of that , " he said . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was a foolish hope . Although she was old , her ability to recall minute details of earlier conversations was uncanny . And he knew that she was much too fond of gambling to overlook the forty crowns hanging in the balance . " A few days , " she said dismissively . " Fie upon them ! What can be done in so little time that has not been done in a fortnight ? You 've lost , Robin . You and your constable of Chelmsford . Now pay up ! " She stretched out an open palm as though she expected him to have the money ready . And for a moment he really believed by the severity of her expression that he must surrender it . " But , Your Majesty , " he protested good-humoredly , " surely you wo n't violate the terms of the wager . We agreed to a month , and though nothing was put in writing , yet it was spoken by the Queen 's lips . I do trust Your Majesty will keep your royal word , for a Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this adroit response and slowly withdrew her hand . By which gesture he knew his money was safe . At least until the end of the month 's time . But she continued to press him about the matter . Why had Stock not written ? What was going on in Derbyshire ? " The Chelmsford constable 's long silence betokens failure  --  or worse , " she said . She waited for an answer . It was not soon in coming . Cecil was loath to admit failure  --  on his own part or on the part of his servants or agents . It was not the forty crowns . That was a mere pittance to one as rich as he . He knew that the Queen had been skeptical of Matthew Stock 's abilities from the time she gazed upon his plain , simple countenance . Her skepticism had egged Cecil on , made him bold in wagering . His pride was at stake  --  and perhaps more . The Queen 's confidence was mixed up in it , too . He looked at his royal mistress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouged to disguise the pallor of her recent indisposition , seemed as thin as parchment . Her eyes were tired , as though she had strained them by reading in poor light . Herp185jeweled hand shook with a palsy . Surely old age was no jest . It came to fell both King and clown and would be at his side soon enough . He had to agree that Matthew Stock 's silence did not bode well . And yes , perhaps he had erred in judgment . He deftly changed the subject , reminding her that she hadpromised an audience within the hour to the French ambassador . " Ah yes , " she said without enthusiasm . " The Frenchmanagain . With a subtle motion of her hand she made him understand their interview was at an end . Yet she had one final word on the Challoner business . " Do n't worry yourself , Robin , about the Chelmsford constable and his wife . Sir John may have not been murdered after all . I do believe that 's Mistress Frances ' opinion now . Or perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river Lethe to her gloomier meditations . " Cecil expressed no opinion himself of this interpretation . He did acknowledge , with an elegant , congratulatory bow of the head , that Frances Challoner had made a very good match for herself . He did not know Thomas Cooke , but he knew the father and he knew that no apple falls far from the trunk . " I made the match , " the Queen said with a toss of her head . " Frances is full of pluck , bright and winsome . Indeed , in her I see my own youth , for I was very like her in countenance and , yes , an orphan too . " " But not husbanded , " Cecil remarked teasingly . She put the Seneca she had cradled in her lap aside and rose , taking Cecil 's hand for support . He gave her his arm and the Queen and her Principal Secretary walked to the end of the gallery . " Never husbanded , " she said , but whether with regret or satisfaction , Cecil could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to be mastered . I have allowed one master of my soul , Jesus Christ my Redeemer . But I would have none for my body . Frances will have a master for her body and I wish her joy of him . He seems a stalwart , promising youth . Although he 's a second son , there 's grit in him . He 'll advance and be advanced . " " With royal approval I am sure he will advance , " Cecil said . " I only pray he 's gentle with her . For she 's a sweet child and I would fain see her free from suffering . "  | " Are you not worried about her going to Thorncombe ? " he asked . They had come to the end of the gallery . Her attendants began to advance toward her but she warned them off with a stern regard . She was not yet finished with Cecil . " I am worried a little , " she admitted . " Not that I fear for her life from a murderer , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that what I 've just said makes no sense whatsoever . That I am an addled old woman . " He started to protest , but she put her hand to his lips to silence him . " I have an uneasy feeling about Frances . I blessed her marriage . I encouraged her to advance the date , thinking it would rid her of her morbid preoccupations . If anything happens to the child , I will not forgive myself . " " What would Your Majesty have me do ? " " Send someone after her . Someone you can trust . Let him be no mere servant but a person of authority and intellect . Someone with a strong arm . " " A soldier ? One of the captains ? " " Not necessarily , " she said . " Just so he is no ordinary constable . " " Very well , Your Majesty , " Cecil said , bowing low but feeling the sting of her implied rebuke . " And , ' Robin . " " Yes , Majesty ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not the loss of Frances Challoner . If he whom you send has the least inkling of murder having been committed at Thorncombe , I will have Frances fetched home straightway to London . As I said , if anything happens to that girl because of arrangements I have made on her behalf I will never forgive myself  --  nor you , either , for it was you who recommended Matthew Stock to this post , wherein he has so plainly failed . " " Yes , Majesty . " " Have him whom you send inform Stock he has not pleased me in this . " " I will so instruct him . "  |p187The  Queen 's attendants now were summoned to her side and Cecil watched while they led her away . He could hear the Queen 's voice chiding the women for something , but the substance was lost in the midst of the other voices . It did not matter . He had been given his dismissal  --  and his instructions . Later , riding through the crowded London streets in his coach , Cecil mulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure himself , he tried to think whom he might send to Derbyshire . The Queen was right , of course . No use sending some hanger-on , overjoyed to travel at the Queen 's expense . A dependablesort was what was needed , someone keen of mind and discerning of falsehood , should it be presented in the guise of truth . Someone like Matthew Stock . There was his own personal secretary . No , he would n't do . There was too much work for him in London . Besides , the man detested travel . There was Sir John Harington , the Queen 's own godson . A witty fellow , with experience in Ireland , but perhaps too witty for his own good . He had , too , barely escaped disgrace in Essex 's rebellion . No , Harington would n't do , either . By the time his coach had stopped at his own residence on the Strand , Cecil had considered and dismissed from consideration twenty candidates for the assignment . Some were clearly deficient in some requisite , others merely unavailable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own apartment by his servant , he had concluded there was but one person to send . Cecil needed a change from the smoky , unhealthy London air . The Queen had given him leave to send whomever he chose . Could he presume that included himself ? When , within the next hour , Matthew Stock 's letter arrived ( unexplicably delayed ) , recounting the horrible murder of a female servant of the castle , Cecil was fully resolved . Frances Challoner had indeed been gone from London for three days , but she had not yet reached Thorncombe . Her journey had been troubled by minor accidents and consequent delays : a broken axle near Coventry ; a misdirection farther on that took them thirty miles out of their way , to the great embarrassment of theirp188guide , who was beside himself with anxiety that his master would flog him for distressing the ladies ; and by Priscilla 's severe stomach cramps , so severe that she thought she would die from them . " It rnust have been something I ate , " she complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . Nor were the roads a help . For the rains of late autumn had set in , and the earth was soggy and the skies so dreary that both young women felt an oppression of spirit that made them poor traveling companions . And the worst , for Frances , was the night before their arrival . They had stopped in Buxton , it being too dark to continue to the castle that day . Their inn was small but clean and comfortable . But there she experienced another disturbing dream . She dreamed she was in what must have been the master 's chamber in the castle . She could tell because of its size , its fine furnishings , its massive hearth with the Challoner arms carved in the stone . She was sitting in bed , wearing a loose-fitting nightgown of silk . Her body was sweetly scented with rosemary and lavender and other perfumes ; her flaxen hair was loose about her alabaster shoulders . It was her wedding night , and he for whom she waited was her bridegroom . In her dream she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled on the bedcovers . Thomas did seem to dawdle . Whatever was he doing ? she wondered impatiently . She could hear voices in distant rooms  --  whisperings , footfalls , knockings , giggles . These she ignored , never wondering at the incongruity of such an apparent company of folk in her castle . Finally , when she was as close to despair as sleep from waiting , a soft knocking came at the door , and she heard a voice say her name . " Frances ? " " Come , " she said , alert and quaking . Her chamber was very dark , the fire having burned low on the hearth , and she could not clearly distinguish her bridegroom 's face . But she knew it was Thomas . Her heart raced and she almost swooned with happiness as he knelt down by the bed . She shut her eyes and leaned her head back on the bolster , sensing him archingp189over her . She felt his lips touch hers , his hand upon her cheek , a gentle , slow caress of admiration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the touch was cold and the breath upon her face was foul like the odor of wet ashes when the rain had run down the chimney . After the revulsion , the disgust , she felt offense  --  offense at his inexplicable delay , offense at his failure to sweeten so foul a breath with cloves or mint . She opened her eyes to rebuke him for his discourtesy . Did he think because God and law had made her his , that he could treat her as chattel ? It was then she saw her visitor was not Thomas . The thing was in burial weeds , misshapen and ghastly to look upon . And the face was the very image of Death , a grinning skull . She awoke in a sweat as cold as the bony hand that had caressed her cheek , struggling for air and with a heavy weight upon her chest , as though the creature of her nightmare , invisible to the waking eye , lay there still , sprawled upon her like an incubus of old legend , satisfying its lust upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day of their arrival at Thorncombe , Frances did not tell her dream to Priscilla . Two dreams of a death's-head within the week ? She would not have to pay tuppence to a cunning woman in Cow Lane to tell her what that portended . " I hope your thoughts are pleasant ones , " Priscilla said , noticing Frances ' silence . " I am thinking , " Frances lied , " of how sadly beautiful the country is . " Priscilla said she had traveled this road before . " Soon there will be but few habitations and only hill , wood , and open sky . " " You have seen Thorncombe before , then ? " Frances asked , turning sideways to her companion . " Never , but I suppose it to be a fitting place for your marriage . You need but a poet to celebrate your solemnities with an epithalamium or two . " " Pray God it be fit , " Frances said , shuddering . Priscilla seemed to notice Frances ' reaction . " Why should n't it be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marriage , but Frances paid only half attention to her friend . The road was rougher now ; the coach labored over the ruts and bumps of a steep incline , and the coachman 's whip was in constant use to urge the team of horses to greater effort . Then suddenly the coach came to a stop and , above the angry shouts of the driver telling someone to make way , Frances heard the anguished screams of an injured animal . She lifted the window flap to see what had caused the stop . A little way ahead , a cart lay overturned in the middle of the road . A man she took to be a farmer by his ragged coat and cap stood looking helplessly at the beast that had pulled the load and now struggled on the ground , kicking its hind legs against the overturned cart . Another man , perhaps the first 's son , stood by also watching the scene . The coach jolted forward , pulled over to the side of the cart , and Frances had a full view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall . Its remaining vitality was now being expended in its hindquarters in a futile effort to stand . The horse 's eyes were wide and bright with fear , and its screams were terrible . Frances leaned out the window and told the coachman to give what aid he could , but the farmer , overhearing , turned to her and said , with a brutal insolence that shocked her , that no help was needed , as though he and his son and his fallen horse were above her charity . The footman climbed down off the top of the coach mumbling to himself , and with pistol in hand he went up to the farmer . Frances watched as the two men came to some agreement and then the footman went over to the injured animal and put the muzzle of the pistol to the horse 's head . She jumped at the loud report and turned away quickly  --  but not before she glimpsed the great splash of blood and the mortal shudder of the horse . The footman fired again , but Frances did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . She heard the footman climbing back atop the coach and only in her mind 's eye saw the white , accusing faces of the farmer and his son . " You should n't have looked , " Priscilla said prudently . Frances heard the driver command the team , heard a sharp crack of his whip ; the coach lurched forward and resumed speed.  |p191The  coach carrying Mistress Frances Challoner and her companion came into view , and Matthew and Joan , standing somewhat apart from the other servants in the castle courtyard , continued to debate what Matthew should say to the new mistress of the house now that the necessity of a report was beyond question . " She must be told of Aileen Mogaill , " Joan advised in a whisper . " Not to tell her would itself be criminal . " " Perhaps she does know already , " Matthew whispered back . " I wrote of it in my letter to Sir Robert . " " Which letter pray God he received , " Joan responded doubtfully . The silence from London since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned them not to expect official letters . She forced a smile for the occasion 's sake now that the coach was coming to a halt just a dozen feet away , but she felt no joy in her heart for the young woman whom Joan could only deem unfortunate to have come into such a bloody inheritance . " All evidence points to Conroy . That I 'll say to her , " Matthew said resolutely . The rub , Joan reflected in these final moments before Mistress Frances ' face appeared in the coach window , was that evidence of Conroy 's guilt was small . A brute , prowler , and treasure hunter  --  Conroy was undoubtedly all that ; but that he was a murderer , too ,  |p192did  not necessarily follow . Besides , Joan retained the strong impression that the Irishman was dead  --  as dead as Aileen Mogaill or Sir John . And , for all she knew , dead by the same hand that had killed them ! Mistress Frances waved in greeting and Joan and Matthew waved back . Matthew murmured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better mood , I warrant . " But Joan 's returning glance  --  there was no more time for words  --  was not intended to affirm her husband 's optimism . Joan had grave doubts in her heart and a multitude of unanswered questions in her head . No pessimist herself , yet she was of no mind to temporize the facts , much less prevaricate . Blood had been shed at Thorncombe , blood shed by an inhabitant or neighbor of the house and not by some passing stranger , as Matthew had told her Edward Bastian had suggested , or by ghostly agency , as the Fludds supposed . Surely more blood would flow . The facts were horrifying and threatening , mind-numbing to contemplate , so that she wondered that she had had the hardihood to stay in the castle so long . No , Joan was convinced Mistress Frances must be told  --  and told the unvarnished truth . As for the wedding  --  it was scheduled for that very week  --  Joan thought the timing most ill advised . It was not that she doubted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom that those who married in haste might repent at leisure . And certainly Mistress Frances was old enough to consider and consent . It was , rather , that the circumstances of doubt and violence in the castle could only poison the feast , and that , to Joan 's mind , was the least harm that might befall it . After all , when she had married Matthew , her mind , properly , had been fixed on marriage , not murder ; she had delighted in the newfound paradise of their common bed , not agonized with visions of decapitated corpses , ghostly legends , and ancient family curses . Yet the letter she had received from Mistress Frances a week earlier had made the headstrong young woman 's determination perfectly clear . The wedding date had been announced to family and friends , the precise day had been named , the minister 's services had been secured , and all requisite documents and deeds had been engrossed . Mostp193importantly , the advancement of the wedding had received the Queen 's special blessing and commendation . Joan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attendant festivities had put a better face on the grim old castle . The new house had been cleaned from top to bottom . The banqueting hall , before as uninviting as an abandoned barn and as filthy , now had been redeemed by a veritable forest of boughs , mixed in with brave martial banners untrunked for the nonce and draped where before only spiders spun their silken habitations . Then all pondering stopped , and , with a graceful curtsy , Joan welcomed the new mistress of Thorncombe to her domain . " Let me see if I understand you aright , " Mistress Frances said when later in the day Matthew and Joan had opportunity to speak to her privily . " This Irish captain and manservant to my late uncle drowned him for his treasure , or knowledge of where it was hid . Then , shortly before your arrival , the same man murdered a young serving woman of the castle , who you think may have been his confederate . " " There may have been a falling-out , " Matthew conjectured . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he believed , then killed her for her share . " " Which treasure was concealed on the island in the lake ? " " So Conroy believed . " Matthew provided a shortened version of his own voyage to the island . He told her of observing Conroy 's digging and assured her that the Irishman had found nothing . " So there may have been no treasure at all . " " That 's possible , " Joan said , thinking at the same time that there remained some mystery about the island , even though it might not be a treasure . " The treasure consisted of Irish plate , jewels  --  all pillaged from Irish Catholics in the wars , " Matthew explained . " Or so rumor alleges . " The allegation did not seem to faze the accused man 's niece . Preoccupied , she sat erectly in a chair by the window overlookingp194the courtyard while the slanting afternoon sun streamed into her lap . There was a short silence , then she sighed heavily and said , as though she were coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , more personal , concerns : " Whatever my uncle may have done , he has doubtlessly paid for his sins with his most treacherous murder . You are in a better position than I , Master Stock , to assess the strength of your contention that this Michael Conroy drowned my uncle for his treasure and cruelly murdered his former helpmate . All seems within the scope of belief , and so I fear his menace . He has disappeared , you say , but there 's no proof he 's left the neighborhood ? " Matthew hesitated before answering , then spoke the blunt truth Joan had advised : " Conroy has disappeared . I have no evidence he has left the neighborhood . " " Why , then he 's still at large and dangerous to me and mine ! " she exclaimed , a sudden wild look in her eyes . Matthew assured her she should have every protection . " It 's a mad murderer indeed who would invade a house full of guests , " he observed . " But after the wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear for my life and the lives of my servants until this dreadful person is arrested ? " To this Matthew and Joan could give no answer , and the young woman stared dolefully from the window as though the solution to her quandary were etched upon the glass . Mistress Frances had arrived on a Tuesday , the wedding was scheduled for Friday , and in the hectic interim , Joan , still functioning as housekeeper , had precious little time for conteinplatingmysteries , for there was still much to do to make the castle ready for the guests , many of whom would be lodged there for the better part of a week . These included the bridegroom 's immediate family ; fifteen to twenty other persons allied to the Cookes by blood or business ; and a half-dozen friends of the groom  --  young bachelors from the Middle Temple . The sheer number of servants alone was not inconsiderable . Along with the gentlefolk were a larger number of guests not to be housed at the castle because they lived within a day 's journey orp195because they lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burghers and their wives , officials of the town and their wives , several local clergymen , none of whom was married , the local justice of the peace , his secretary , and several other dignitaries and lesser dignitaries . All these , too , were accompanied by servants , who would be feasted in the courtyard and on the greensward along with most of the local villagers , who would regard a share of the feast as their traditional right . The Staffords , to no one 's surprise , had not been invited . To help serve this great company of guests , the Fludds had been recalled to duty , and many of the Challoner tenants and their wives had been impressed as doormen , waiters , drawers , and maids . Una , half hysterical for worry as to how she would prepare food for such a multitude , had been given the assistance of three cooks and four bakers  --  all very experienced , according to Moll , who had been put in charge of recruitment because of her superior knowledge of the local work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Joan swore they had been snatched that very day from the Buxton almshouse . Meanwhile , Matthew was no less occupied . To his lot had fallen the provisioning of the castle , the supervision of the carts that daily brought foodstuffs from the village and from Buxton , the slaughtering of cattle and sheep , the securing of fish and fowl , and the procurement of the great quantities of wine and ale that on no account could fall short of what was needed for fear that bad luck should haunt the wedded couple ever after . In all this hustle , however , Joan thought in her periodic interviews with the mistress of Thorncombe that the shadow of apprehension had not passed  --  indeed it seemed to have lengthened and deepened as the hour of the wedding approached , if Joan was any judge . Since , to Mistress Frances ' way of thinking , the alleged perpetrator of the Challoner murders remained at large , Joan could understand this apprehension even though Joan herself continued to be dubious about Conroy 's guilt . Indeed , she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matthew , of course , had informed Thomas Cooke of Conroy 's history , but the pleasant young man had hardly seemed to believe it . " What , " he had declared with a broad smile rich in incredulity ,
