A setback came last week when Midlantic National Bank of Edison , N.J. , called in a $425 million bond issue . Midlantic , sole trustee for the 17 percent debentures due in 2004 , demanded payment of the bonds ' principal and accruing interest . Public Service had skipped a $37 million interest payment on the notes Oct. 15. // // The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in Public Service shares for several hours Dec. 9 , the day of Midlantic ' s action , and a Public Service spokesman said the company would try to avoid being forced into involuntary bankruptcy while out-of-court reorganization efforts are in progress. // That setback followed a couple of small earlier victories for Public Service : // On Dec. 4 , the United States Court for the District of New Hampshire granted the utility ' s request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting another group of bondholders from holding a meeting to consider reorganizing the company . According to Public Service , the meeting was scheduled as part of a takeover attempt. // And on Nov. 25 , the Nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency ' s licensing division from issuing a low-power license , a preliminary step before full-power operation. // The 1 , 150-megawatt Seabrook reactor was loaded with fuel in October 1986 , but has been idle since then , immobilized by Massachusetts Gov . Michael Dukakis ' s decision not to participate in the NRC-mandated emergency response plans to be submitted by all cities and towns within a 10-mile radius of the plant . Six such towns are in Massachusetts. // New Hampshire law prohibits the utility from recovering any of its investment in the $5 billion plant until it begins operating . The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission is thus barred from granting Public Service ' s request for $70 million in emergency rate relief. // Uncollected costs for the utility are accumulating at about $1 million a day , and the recent inability of Public Service to raise money in the capital markets and to stop diminishing cash reserves has put it on a fast track to insolvency. // Against this background , the utility recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a financial restructuring proposal to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defer 1988 maturity payments of $175 million. // The proposal would mean voluntarily exchanging certain outstanding third-mortgage bonds and unsecured debt for new bonds and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. // While the utility says the restructuring plan will actually reduce its capitalization and thereby lower its debt service obligations , the group of utility bondholders , Consolidated Utilities &; Communications Inc. , has challenged the proposal , calling it little more than a stopgap bailout. // Consolidated Utilities has come up with its own restructuring plan . Under it , Public Service would be split into two companies . The first , called Seabrook Inc. , would continue to be owned by present Public Service stockholders along with current unsecured creditors . Seabrook Inc. would retain Public Service ' s 36 percent interest in the Seabrook plant. // The ' ' New Public Service ' ' would be owned by the utility ' s current third-mortgage bondholders , who would agree to transform their debt instruments into equity shares. // The Dec. 4 court injunction forced cancellation of a Dec. 9 meeting called for by the trustee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service ' s current financial difficulties. // A Consolidated Utilities spokesman denied that the consortium of bondholders was positioning itself for a takeover bid . ' ' We are dealing with alternative plans for reorganizing the company , ' ' he said. // In a Dec. 1 report to the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission , the utility said it had met with Consolidated Utilities representatives , but had not reached agreement with them on the proper evaluation for the company - a key to any viable exchange offer. // Public Service is already in technical default , having suspended scheduled principal and interest payments on certain unsecured notes and debentures in October . This exposes the company to petitions from securities holders , like Midlantic Bank , who could force the utility into involuntary bankruptcy . Some analysts , however , believe such a petition is more likely to come from holders of third-mortgage bonds , if and when the utility defaults on these. // In its Nov. 25 motion for a preliminary injunction against Consolidated , Public Service said it has not conceded it would fail to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // According to John Edwards , vice-president of Public Service , the original capital restructuring proposal was based on the voluntary participation of 85 percent of the debt meant for exchange . This means that opposition by owners of about 16 percent of the debt could block the plan , and Consolidated Utilities officials say it has enough of the debt to do this. // Financial analyst Tom Hamlin , vice-president at the Chicago firm of Duff &; Phelps , believes Consolidated chairman Martin Whitman has garnered enough proxies to veto any of these restructuring plans. // ' ' What he is effectively doing is making a run on the company , ' ' he says. // The major obstacle to Public Service ' s effort to regain financial integrity continues to be the absence of a comprehensive emergency evacuation plan . In removing a key impediment to issuing a low-power operating license , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission accepted the utility ' s evacuation plan , offered in place of a community-based plan. // The utility ' s authority to submit such a plan when state or local governments refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new rule . On Dec. 1 , however , Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon filed an appeal in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston , seeking to overturn the rule. // Mr. Shannon said Massachusetts refused to approve emergency plans for Seabrook because such plans could not adequately protect its citizens in the event of a nuclear accident . The NRC rule change was ' ' designed to circumvent the constitutional rights and police powers of the state , ' ' Shannon told the court. // ' ' We can not and will not allow this to happen , ' ' he said. // //
