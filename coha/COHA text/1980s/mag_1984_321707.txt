" Relations with the U.S. are better than ever , and Israel 's international position has improved . " <P> <P> Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir , in full voice but visibly fatigued from the dual responsibilities of being head of government and a candidate on the hustings , welcomed Correspondents Kelly and Halevy to his Jerusalem office and talked at length about his government 's prospects . Excerpts : <P> <P> On the economy . The answers of the Likud and Labor are the same , more or less . In the Western countries , there is a classic answer for inflation : unemployment . We do n't accept it , we do n't tolerate it . Therefore we have to look for other ways , and we say there has to be a social contract . There must be a national agreement among all the main factors of the economy-workers , industrialists and government-to freeze prices , wages and taxes . It is the only way to bring about a decline of the rate of inflation without having unemployment . <P> On Lebanon . There will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create conditions that will enable us one day to pull out our forces : by strengthening the Lebanese Army , by reaching agreements with local groups of the population . The Likud does not want to stay in Lebanon . But for the moment , the Lebanese government does not have anything to offer . It does not even control Beirut . <P> On the West Bank . Almost nobody in Israel wants to give up any territory . It does n't mean that all these people want Israeli rule over all the territories . I think we are faithful to the Camp David agreements . We will stick to this agreement . In the end there will be negotiations , without a doubt , because in any such situation there is some point where the parties decide that they have to agree . <P> On the future . We can see Israel becoming more and more a developed modern country with a dynamic society . <P> We are making important technological progress , we are im proving the moral basis of the society . The social differences are becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure than we had seven years ago . At that time there were two Israels , and the second included the suburbs and development towns where the new immigrants from Arab countries lived . Now even this definition has disappeared . The feeling of belonging to Israeli society is now much more general . I think it is a great accomplishment of the Likud . <P> <P> On relations with the U.S. One of the arguments in 1977 was that if the Likud came to power there would be a war with the Arab countries because of the occupied territories and then relations with the U.S. and with all the Western world would become terrible . <P> Nobody would be ready to speak with us . What was the outcome ? Exactly the opposite . Relations with the U.S. are better than ever before . We concluded a peace treaty with Egypt . We have problems with this treaty , but it is still peace . It means that Israel 's international position has improved . <P>               @ @ @ @ @ @
