Ronald Reagan is two of America 's favorite characters , the nice boy next door and the lovable , opinionated uncle , getting on but pretty damn lively for his age , cheerful , friendly , great storyteller ( known to shade one to make a point ) , no big brain trust but plenty of common sense . Reagan comes from two quintessentially American places , the Middle Western small town and golden &lt; California . The movie actor years , far from creating a stagy celebrity , seem to have merged role and reality  --  the good guy everybody ( except maybe a few snobs and eggheads ) wants to be , the American as seen by the American . This is a very different sort of leader from the aristocratic Franklin Roosevelt , the Hudson River squire , or the dashing young Jack Kennedy , the rich Irish- American nouveau Brahmin  --  two rare species . The many Americans who revered them did not for a moment imagine that these magnetic figures were simply themselves called to Washington . <P> In his plain Americanness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he is a better politician than Ford or Truman , and has had more of an idea of what he wanted to do as President than Ike did . Reagan neatly stood on its head a cherished assumption of most students of the presidency : that vigorous , ebullient presidential leadership would naturally aim at expanding the role of the Federal Government ( and the Chief Magistrate ) , and that any President of contrary outlook would necessarily be a cold , crabbed type or at best likably lazy . Franklin Roosevelt was the exemplar of the bold , joyous activist , Coolidge and Hoover the chill naysayers ( so the academic stereotype went ) , Ike the lazy nice guy . So here came Reagan , not overworking himself but relishing the job and the power , using it with great gusto and skill to shrink the role of Government and of the President . <P> Reagan is a man of certitudes . Not since Harry Truman , very possibly , has a President been so confident he was right . There are plentiful hazards in that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have chosen as one of his favorite messages the Reinhold Niebuhr line that Carter used to quote : " The sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world . " Reagan is not a big ambiguity fan .
