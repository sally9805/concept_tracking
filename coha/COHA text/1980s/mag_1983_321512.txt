A major league job for Baker ? <P> <P> In the Reagan White House it is customary to diffuse controversy with a snappy one-liner that lightens the mood . When rumors began circulating last week that Chief of Staff James Baker might leave his post to become commissioner of baseball , Baker made full use of the jocular material at hand . In response to reporters ' shouts of " Play ball ! , " Baker pantomimed a pitch , and grinned at every fatuous request for tickets to the World Series . Even his colleagues got in a few cuts . At a staff meeting , Baker found an official major league baseball next to his coffee cup . Said another Reagan aide : " He 's having some fun with the whole thing . " <P> The fun soon wore thin . Some viewed the episode as a rare example of hubris from Baker and an embarrassment to President Reagan , who learned that he might lose his aide from the morning newspaper . Said Reagan : " I was as surprised as anyone to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not received a formal offer from the team owners and that he regretted that the story had leaked . The two men agreed to discuss the matter further this week . <P> When the rumor of Baker 's departure surfaced at an owners ' meeting in Nashville , some political pros took it as a sign that Reagan might not seek a second term . Nevada Senator Paul Laxalt , who heads the Reagan re-election effort , quickly reasserted that the President would declare his candidacy in late January , and stressed that Baker was " vital to the re-election effort . He 's a hell of a lot more important than Campaign Director Ed Rollins or myself . " <P> That sort of ego massage may have been what Baker had in mind when he issued a tepid " no comment " instead of hotly denying the baseball commission story . In the past , Baker tried hard to squelch rumors that he would run for a Senate seat . However , he did covet William Clark 's post as National Security Adviser , and had persuaded Reagan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meese and other hard-liners sabotaged his bid . His pique and frustration may have made him receptive to job offers . " The fact that Baker has not knocked this story down with a baseball bat , " says one associate , " shows that it 's still a possibility . " For their part , the baseball owners announced that Bowie Kuhn would stay on as commissioner until March 1 , and that they could not determine when his successor would be named . <P> If Baker stays in the running , it will reinforce the impression that the White House staff is restless and feuding . Director of Communications David Gergen resigned last week to accept a fellowship at Harvard 's Institute of Politics . Three weeks earlier , Legislative Liaison Kenneth Duberstein quit to join a private lobbying firm . The departure of these two " pragmatists " as well as the expected resignation early next year of Budget Director David Stockman , will leave Baker with only two staunch allies in the White House , Michael Deaver and Richard Darman . That prospect , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the reason that one of Reagan 's steadiest players is flirting with the idea of becoming a free agent . -
