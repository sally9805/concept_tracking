Through better diets and increased exercise , most Americans can look forward to longer lives . Last week , however , the National Center for Health Statistics reported a disturbing countertrend . From 1984 to 1986 , the average life expectancy of whites rose from 75.3 to a record 75.4 years . But for blacks during that same period it declined , going from 69.7 to 69.4 years . A major cause : a stark increase in accidental deaths and homicides . While there are 5.6 murders among each 100,000 whites , there are a harrowing 32.4 homicides for each 100,000 blacks , up 15% . Among black males the rate is even higher : 55.9 per 100,000.
