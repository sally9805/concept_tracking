We ' re in her dressing room at the Gershwin Theatre , about an hour before she goes on in tonight ' s ' ' Much Ado About Nothing . ' ' It alternates with ' ' Cyrano de Bergerac ' ' in the troupe ' s Broadway run , which ends Jan. 19 , whereupon the RSC will travel to the Kennedy Center in Washington , D.C. , for a month-long engagement. // Miss Cusack plays Beatrice in the Shakespeare comedy and Roxane in Rostand ' s epic . She always gets a touch of stage fright before the curtain rises , but you ' d never know it from the confidence of her strong , breathy voice. // Why call her profession ' ' the shy man ' s revenge ' ' ? Cusack explains her theory. // ' ' You get a chance to don the characteristics and clothes of other people , who do things that are brave and dreadful and heartwarming and foul , ' ' she says , with both glee and trepidation in her tone . ' ' You have opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ones you ' d never dream of showing amongst your friends or even lovers. // ' ' And you ' re hidden , ' ' she adds after a pause . ' ' Because it ' s only acting , isn ' t it ? You can make adventurous leaps you might never have the opportunity to do in life , because it ' s really not you - or you pretend it isn ' t . You examine areas of life and personality that others may blinker themselves to , that are uncomfortable and difficult . You have opportunities to broaden your vision . . . . ' ' // Then , with a sudden grin , she catches her own words up . ' ' But that ' s all very grandiose , ' ' she says in a bright , self-mocking way . ' ' Probably I just like it because they clap when I go out there ! // ' ' Maybe I ' m only justifying the fact that I ' m an egomaniac , a megalomaniac , and need people to reassure // me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she goes on . ' ' I ' m sure that ' s also a heavy motive for a lot of actors . We all feel inadequate , and most actors I know are the most inadequate human beings you tend to come across . Up there onstage you ' re reassured that everything ' s all right and you are actually loved . . . . ' ' // Sinead - that ' s pronounced ' ' shin-ed ' ' - got her stage ambitions early . She knew the theater was for her by age 12 , partly because she comes from a long acting tradition . Her father is Cyril Cusack , renowned on stage and screen alike . Her mother was also a performer , and two grandparents were ' ' strolling players ' ' who toured the English and Irish provinces. // Not that her family steered her toward a stage career . Her father remembered the instability of his own childhood , when ' ' he ' d knock at the door of a different school every week , ' ' and determined to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So we were academically prepared for life , very heavily , ' ' Sinead recalls . ' ' My father wanted me to be an academician. ' ' // But her ideas were different . At just over 17 she entered University College , Dublin , and at the same time she auditioned for the Abbey Theatre , the Irish national stage company . She had no formal training , but sailed through on native talent and enthusiasm - which , she learned , will carry you just so far. // ' ' I did my university and acting careers together for two years , ' ' Cusack recalls , ' ' and then I was thrown out of the Abbey because they said I couldn ' t be heard beyond the first six rows . I had an instrument that was completely untrained , and I couldn ' t make it do for me what the native talent needed . I couldn ' t translate the talent for an audience because I didn ' t have a voice , a body that moved to project that inner knowledge. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depths , but Cusack was unfazed . ' ' I went to England to seek my fortune , ' ' she says . ' ' And because I had this round face and blue eyes and long blond hair , I got cast very quickly in television and films . That wasn ' t what I intended to do , ever , but I got sidetracked for many years. ' ' // It ' s a measure of Sinead ' s seriousness about her art that she didn ' t revel in her screen success . She kept chafing to go back onstage - even though the stage had beaten her once , and a return to the theater would mean minor work in out-of-the-way venues . In fact , she welcomed the idea of rigorous training away from the major leagues . ' ' I wanted . . . to work in the provinces and make up for my lack of training , ' ' she insists . ' ' My ambition never changed. ' ' // One of her strategies was to keep asking the Royal Shakespeare Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-class teaching company ' ' and not just a busy performing troupe . But those doors didn ' t open easily . ' ' They turned me down year after year , ' ' Cusack recalls . ' ' Once they took me as a replacement for Judi Dench - she ' s probably the greatest living actress in England - but I suffered by comparison , so they threw me out again. ' ' // It ' s another measure of Sinead ' s tenacity that she didn ' t waver after being thrown out of two leading European theaters . ' ' I should have given up , ' ' she says cheerfully , ' ' but not me ! ' ' The breakthrough came when her boyfriend , a handsome actor named Jeremy Irons , was appearing in an RSC production with two other cronies . The leading lady decided to leave the cast , and Sinead ' s friends proposed her for the role . ' ' I had seen it seven or eight times and I knew all the lines , ' ' she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away with it. ' ' // Thus she entered the RSC for good . ' ' Once I was in I was like a leech ! ' ' she says with a grin . ' ' And the parts got better and better , and my work got better and better. ' ' // Some things in Sinead ' s life have changed since those days . For one , she ' s now married to Irons , and spends much of her time tending Sam , their six-year-old son . One challenge here is giving the youngster security without becoming rigid about his upbringing , as she feels some actors ( including her father ) do with their children. // ' ' We ' re operating from the viewpoint that a loving background is probably more important than a very secure geographical background , ' ' she says . ' ' My father ' s concern was to root us in every way , but Sam has traveled since he was five years old . He ' s a terrifically adaptable child as a result . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attending since age 3. // Other things are the same for Sinead as they were years ago , including her lack of formal theater training . She has mixed feelings about this. // ' ' I feel I could have been enormously helped by some measure of formal training , ' ' she admits . ' ' As a young actress , my limitations had to do mainly with my voice and with handling classical texts . I simply couldn ' t do it , and I was bad at it , even though I did seem to have a gift and a talent for communicating on television or in a smaller space . The difficulty of handling formal texts would have been ironed out of me in drama school. ' ' // Since her stage experience has been mostly classical so far , it ' s ironic that Miss Cusack was intimidated by the classics in her early years , even though ' ' the worst possible evil for an actress is to be frightened by texts . ' ' What was the problem ? ' ' I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us are about Shakespeare . Because I ' d been taught badly at school , or maybe just because I ' m an Irish peasant , I felt you had to be serious about him , that you had to never smile while delivering a line. // ' ' But that ' s a load of nonsense ! ' ' she goes on . ' ' Of course he ' s the greatest living playwright , as I like to call him . But he ' s also the actor ' s friend . He gives you texts of such depth and complexity and interest that you can never be bored. ' ' // Cusack has now been performing Shakespeare ' ' seriously ' ' for six years , and still finds ' ' 60 to 600 to 6 , 000 ways of reading each text . ' ' She loves the Bard because ' ' he can be approached from so many angles . And every night there ' s another discovery - some nugget or little gem that makes the play glow anew. ' ' // How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by going onstage ? ' ' I hope he doesn ' t , ' ' Sinead says , offering another glimpse into her life as an actress and the difficulties she ' s gone through . ' ' We ( performers ) put ourselves up to be shot down . We suffer a lot of humiliation and rejection , especially in the early years . We have to put a wall around ourselves to protect against that attack - rejection by critics , audiences , directors , whatever - which never stops , even when you ' ve reached your mid-70s like my dad. // ' ' There are great rewards , ' ' she adds . ' ' I don ' t mean financial rewards , which are only for a few , but rewards for the spirit and ego , which are marvelous when they happen . Still , it ' s not an easy or gentle life . There ' s lots of difficulty and pain involved that I wish my kid wouldn ' t have to go through. ' ' // Concerning her future , Cusack springs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . ' ' There ' s always a danger of complacency if you remain with one area of life or work too long , ' ' she explains . ' ' I ' ve been lucky enough to achieve an ambition I had since I was very young , but if you don ' t have new challenges you grow old quickly and get bored . I ' ve met the RSC challenge and I ' ve met it well . Now it ' s time for new ones . ' ' She isn ' t sure what form they ' ll take , but hopes her future will include more contemporary work by living playwrights. // ' ' The wonder of theater to me - what gets me most excited - is that through the communication of pure thought , you can project to other people sitting out there , ' ' says the actress with gusto . ' ' I don ' t understand how it happens . . . but a lot of very exciting things can happen through that intimacy we have as actors on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other and our bodies to respond to each other.
