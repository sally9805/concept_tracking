The major league baseball players throw a knuckle ball <P> There was a strange stillness . . . It was a spring without voices . . . only silence lay over the fields . . . <P> &shy; Rachel Carson , The Silent Spring <P> For baseball fans , the thought of springtime without the national pastime was at least as shocking as Rachel Carson 's ghostly 1962 musing about environmental death in the season of new life . Spring without the crack of the bat , the call of the ump , the roar of the crowd ! Only the players , of all people , shouting " St-e-e-rike ! " <P> Such was the prospect as the end of spring training approached with no new contract between the Major League Players Association and the 26 teams ' owners . But then the players ' representatives decided to throw the owners not a strike , but a knuckle ball . They voted to 1 ) skip the remaining exhibition games but 2 ) open the regular season on time this week and 3 ) take their walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , if a new contract is not signed by then . <P> The off-again , on-again decision gives the players a chance to pick up a few paychecks and some more time to iron out their differences with the owners . It is also fairly savvy , wiping out some exhibition games that do not benefit the players ( they are paid only from the start of the regular season ) and threatening to stop play only when the crowds start coming around Memorial Day . Said the New York Yankees ' Reggie Jackson : " We wanted to try to take some money from the war chest the clubs have been stockpiling . " Indeed , the baseball owners demonstrated little faith in the negotiations : they had built up a strike kitty and taken out strike insurance paying them around $1 million a day . <P> At issue is nothing so mundane as money but rather the future of the free-agent system that has evolved since 1975 , when baseball 's age-old reserve clause was struck down . Under the court ruling , players could become free agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left were not entitled to compensation from the team they moved to . The next year , the players agreed to soften the blow to the owners : they signed a contract that called for a minimum of six years with a team before ballplayers could declare themselves free agents , and each club signing a player had to grant his old team a pick in the amateur draft . <P> But the owners , in their quest for free-agent talent , pushed salaries to dizzying heights ; former California Angels Pitcher Nolan Ryan , for instance , was signed last winter by the Houston Astros for $1 million-plus a year . So now the proprietors are seeking to cool the competition for stars : they have proposed that a club that signs a highly sought-after free agent must allow his former team to take one of its players in return . <P> The players say this would crimp their prospects on the free-agent market . Certainly the need to surrender proven quality in exchange for open market talent would inhibit many acquisitive owners . But Players Association Executive Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in high-priced stars . Says Miller : " In the years since free agency , baseball has set four straight records for attendance , gate receipts and TV revenues . Now they say we have to agree to go backward .
