Twice a year for the past two years , the House has voted to end U.S. funding for the contras , the 10,000 or so antigovernment guerrillas fighting in Nicaragua . To a majority of the House , supporting the rebels has seemed wrong on principle , or counterproductive as a check on Nicaragua 's Sandinista leaders , or both . Just as regularly , the Administration has insisted that the contra war , in which some 5,000 Nicaraguans died last year , provides Washington with essential leverage in its efforts to moderate the Sandinistas ' excesses . Last week the policy to and fro resumed as Congress began considering a White House request for $14 million to fund the contras . <P> The aid measure will probably come to a vote next month , after the White House releases a comprehensive anti-Sandinista report . A continued ban on funding would be a " serious mistake , " warned Assistant Secretary of State Langhorne A. Motley last week in testimony before a House foreign affairs subcommittee . Nicaragua , he argued , would then " have no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studds told Motley , but " whether you like it or not . . . support for the rebels is dead . " <P> Liberals and moderates are hesitant to seem like apologists for the antidemocratic Sandinistas . On the other hand , there is little real enthusiasm even among most Administration officials for the contras ' no-win insurgency . " It 's not that we are so delighted with the policy , " says one State Department official . " It 's just that we can not see what else would work and still receive any kind of support . " On the Hill , there has been some discussion of dispatching nonmilitary aid to the families of the contra combatants or finding some other , aboveboard way to aid the rebels . Last week Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger suggested that he might support formal trade sanctions on the economically tottering country , which he said still " unabashedly exports subversion and terrorism . " <P> Initially , the ostensible reason for funding the contras was to stanch the flow of aid that Nicaragua supplied to rebels in El Salvador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandinistas off balance , the insurrection may soften them up to make political concessions . Yet concessions require serious negotiations and in January , Washington suspended the talks that U.S. and Nicaraguan officials had been having in Mexico since last June . The State Department is nevertheless still hopeful about persuading Congress to subsidize the contras . " Motley 's testimony was only our first shot , " said one official . " We have not yet begun to mount our offensive . "
