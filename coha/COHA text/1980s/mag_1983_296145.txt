" Big E " runs aground <P> He had guided one of the largest ships afloat through eight months and 46,500 uneventful miles at sea . Suddenly Captain Robert J. Kelly , at the helm of the carrier U.S.S. Enterprise and a mere 1,700 yds. from voyage 's end in San Francisco Bay , felt what he called " a very deep feeling in the pit of my stomach . " His 1,123-ft. - long , 75,700-ton nuclear-powered vessel had veered out of its 42-ft. - deep channel and slid to a stop in 29 ft. of water . <P> For more than five hours , the huge flattop sat ignobly in the calm water , stuck in the mud of the bay . The 3,500-man crew could only stare across the short , unbridgeable distance to some 3,000 friends and relatives waiting in frustration at Alameda Naval Air Station , the carrier 's home port . On shore , a gentle drizzle ruined the coiffures of women who had long looked forward to the reunions . Shirley Genson of Centerville , Ala. , lamented , " This is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Said Debbie Harris of Show Low , Ariz. , about her husband , Petty Officer Kenneth Harris : " It 's awful hard being able to see him , but not see him . " Through the waiting crowd rippled a common joke : " The crew must have asked the captain to head for the nearest bar . And he did . " <P> Eleven tugs , like minnows trying to budge a whale , nudged the carrier or pulled with tow lines , but the Enterprise did not move . In a maneuver akin to righting an unbalanced rowboat , the ship 's crew was ordered to assemble on the carrier 's port side . Their combined weight , coupled with the shifting of water in the vessel 's ballast tanks , was meant to tip the ship in hopes of freeing it . But the keel , which normally requires 36 ft. of water for safe clearance , remained stuck . Only with the help of the outgoing tide did the Enterprise finally break loose from its unwanted mooring and finish its long journey home . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explosion and fire that had killed 28 Enterprise crew members during training maneuvers off Hawaii in January 1969 . Still , Captain Kelly had just recently learned that , after commanding the ship for 3 years , he had been recommended for promotion to commodore . Although a civilian pilot was advising Kelly during the harbor entry , the skipper declared , " I am totally responsible for what happened . " A Navy investigation will determine whether Kelly 's new broad stripe was lost in the mud , along with the proud ship 's dignity .
