They were all dancers . Cagney propelled himself through space like a bullet or a bull terrier , his torso a few seconds ahead of his legs ; anyone without a dancer 's equilibrium would have fallen on his face . Fonda was just the opposite : a triumph of convex geometry , his thin body a question mark that ambled at Stepin Fetchit pace toward a girl or a cause . <P> Hepburn seemed always on the ascendant , scaling the invisible ramp of her own confidence . But it was Fred Astaire who defined screen movement , for the ' 30s and forever . With athletic nonchalance , he showed moviegoers how the human body could express strength , rapture , elegance , amazing grace . <P> A half-century of Astaire in the movies has made his achievement seem both ineffable and inevitable . Even today , at 82 , Astaire is lithe and healthy as he waltzes through the occasional film role . In his latest , Ghost Story , due out next month , Astaire and three other elderly gents ( Melvyn Douglas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oddest might be the one about Fred 's rise to stardom . Fifty years ago , it was difficult to spot a potential movie star in a body that photographed small , frail , bewildered . Fred and his sister Adele had danced through hit Broadway shows for a dozen years before Adele 's marriage to an English lord , but to a movie mogul their stage success could be attributed to snob appeal and second-balcony myopia . In close-up Fred looked-and , in moments of earthbound repose , acted-like Stan Laurel . Thus the famous pronouncement on Astaire 's first screen test : <P> " Ca n't act . Ca n't sing . Balding . Can dance a little . " But oh , how he danced ! That was evident from Ms second film , Flying Down to Rio ( 1933 ) , when he was paired with a perky chorine named Ginger Rogers . Between then and 1939 Astaire and Rogers made eight films-and movie history . <P> It was said of Astaire-Rogers : " He gave her class . She gave him sex . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dance , Carefree-but their roles were constant . <P> Fred was nature 's nobleman , Ginger the plucky girl who made good by dancing well . It did n't matter that the films ' plots were aggressively silly , the dialogue often inane . When the music swelled , and Fred took Ginger by the hand , and she leaned into his body , and the dance began , a more beautiful story was told : of the emotions only motion can convey , of two people 's need for transcendence , of the perfect fusion of passion and technique into a delicate , sensual mating dance . <P> Their greatest number , Never Gon na Dance from Swing Time , is an eight-minute ballet of seduction and parting . The quarreling lovers wo n't dance ; they must dance . Their bodies sway helplessly to the music and then surrender to embrace . <P> Retreating , touching , whirling across the ballroom floor , they try to fight the magnetism of their love , their shared art . The only way to escape its pull is to play the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winding staircase and into the spiraling ecstasy of a dozen dizzying pirouettes . Suddenly she is gone . He is alone . The dance is over .
