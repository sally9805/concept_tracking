A basketball giant ends his career in injury and litigation <P> When he could play , Bill Walton was the Man Mountain of basketball , a flame-haired , 6-ft. 11-in. , 225-lb. human wall beneath the basket . The true measure of his greatness was the glint in his eyes , the concentrated , almost maniacal fury that burned when he leaped to block a shot or scanned the floor before rifling an outlet pass on a fast break . That intensity made Walton one of the finest and most feared centers of his generation . <P> At U.C.L.A. , he carried the Bruins to two national championships in three years . Yet when he joined the Portland Trail Blazers as the top pick of the draft , the dream began to unravel . Walton was plagued by injuries and played just part of his first two seasons . Caught up on the fringes of radical politics , he was questioned by the FBI when it was suspected that one of his friends had harbored Patty Hearst during her days as a fugitive . Introspective and reclusive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred a lumberjack 's wool shirts to superfly fur coats . <P> Through it all , he retained his aura of great promise . In 1976-77 , Walton 's only season free of injuries , he took the Trail Blazers to the league championship and won the Most Valuable Player award in the playoffs . The following year , Portland again jumped off to an early lead . But midway through the season , Walton broke the tarsal navicular bone in his left foot , just under the ankle . Though hobbled , he returned for the playoffs . <P> Walton has subsequently charged in a lawsuit that the Trail Blazers ' doctor injected him with pain-killing drugs to enable him to play , thus aggravating his injury . A long and fruitless rehabilitation began . <P> When his contract with Portland expired in 1979 , Walton signed with the San Diego Clippers for an estimated $750,000 a year . Though assured that his injury had healed , the Clippers took no chances : they secured a $1.25 million insurance policy on their fragile star from member companies of Lloyd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he developed a crippling pain in his left foot . It was discovered that he had rebroken the same tarsal navicular bone . He came back to try again in early 1980 , went up for a rebound - and injured the bone yet again . Walton made a final attempt at taking to the court during training camp last fall , but the pain in his foot was so severe that , at last , Walton , his doctors and the Clippers faced an all too obvious fact : at 28 , Bill Walton would not play basketball again . <P> Ironically , Walton 's fate might easily have been prevented years ago . He was born with high arches and a left heel bone that does not allow his foot to turn out . So when he walks or jumps , the impact is concentrated on the ball of his foot rather than being more evenly distributed . According to his physician and adviser , Dr. Ernie Vandeweghe , a former N.B.A. player , such conditions are often repaired when a youngster reaches adolescence . Says Vandeweghe : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty valuable commodity , already on his way to stardom . And he never complained about the pain . He lived and played throughout his life in a great deal of pain . He did n't know that having his feet hurt was n't normal . "
