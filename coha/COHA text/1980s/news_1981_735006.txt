txt Television in a decade will be very different , the biggest change being increased public-affairs programming . Individuals and minority groups will get more say on network TV . And more public figures who appear on panel shows will get more critical scrutiny . Those are just some of the developments foreseen for the medium by Roone Arledge , head of ABC News . When Mr. Arledge took over four years ago , the industry was skeptical about his ability to jack up the lackluster ABC operation . He succeeded . ABC News is much improved . For the first time in broadcasting history , there is heated three-way competition in news . And Mr. Arledge has become one of the most visible and powerful broadcasting executives . Recently he sat still for an interview : Q. : There is much talk that news and informational programming will constitute a much greater share of network air time . Do you believe this is true ? A. : If someone were to come back five or 10 years from now , they would n't recognize Roone Arledge television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cable channels and all the rest of the new technologies . The most obvious change will be in the amount of news and information programming being carried . Whether that will happen as an explosion or a gradual evolution , I do n't know . If you look back five years ago , you would be surprised at how much more news there is on television today . Q. : There is talk of the networks going into all-news cable TV programming . What are your plans ? A. : We do n't have any immediate plans . We might get into cable programming someday with news . Setting up a 24-hour system as Ted Turner found out ( with Cable News Network ) is a very complex and expensive proposition . Whether that 's going to be feasible in the very near future or not , I 'm not sure . But at some point there will be people doing news on cable other than Mr. Turner . It 's logical the networks would be involved in some way . Q. : There is talk of a viewpoint show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a program ? A. : Viewpoint or opinion , I 'm not sure what we are going to call it . We 're going to do one this summer in prime time . We 're not sure , but it will be at least a half hour or an hour . Basically , the purpose of it is to access television to groups of people who do not have access . In a sense , it is similar to the op-ed page of a newspaper . It is not a place where we will correct errors . We correct errors , if we make them . in the program itself . There are individuals or groups or corporations or minor political parties that feel they are not represented because they are too small or they think their viewpoint was n't expressed in a piece we did . We are going to experiment with a way to do that . The problem is , what are the ground rules ? How much do you use ? What do you edit ? We do n't want to suppress what anyone has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length . One of the thorny parts is if someone has something for the air that you feel is not correct . Do you correct It or let it go on ? If it works , it will go beyond the Letters to the Editor and go a long way to addressing a very real problem . The power of television is so great that lack of exposure of certain ideas or points of view is a real inequity , and this may be a way of addressing this . Q. : What is your position on issue advertising ? ( Commercials dealing with controversial public issues ) : A. : We said to the network that we certainly do n't want that as part of the news program . As an individual I do n't want to confuse issue advertising with news . If someone wants to take out an ad on television that has something to do with issues . that 's fine , or if it does n't have anything to do with issues that 's fine . We should n't be any more involved in it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editorial people . Q. : What are your news expansion plans ? A. : We plan currently to introduce in September an hour-long Sunday program that will incorporate and expand on " Issues and Answers . " Generally , this is an attempt to change the nature of the weekend talk-interview programs that have n't changed in 25 years . They are all alike . We just feel that we should do a better job . In addition to having a main guest , we want to educate the viewer ahead of time about the issues that are involved . Perhaps some critics will comment . We want to put the people in context so that when we interview them , the person watching will have some understanding of the issues . And then there would be either a permanent or semi-permanent panel of people who would ask questions . We would like to work in some sort of thing at the end where you can discuss what the guest said so that it is not Just a straight platform for a person to make statements . Q. : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race ? A. : I have to go back to square one and say that I do n't totally believe in the ratings to begin with . They tend to measure you qualitatively by how you do quantitatively . I 'm not saying that ratings should n't exist . Advertisers have to know what they are buying . What I 'm saying is a prelude to whether we are going to be ahead of CBS . News divisions are comparable to a newspaper in that you have various aspects to it . The evening news is your front page or front section . Then you have morning news or late night , documentaries , and special events . If you combine all that together , we are probably No. 1 right now . I think that what will happen is that you will never see anybody as far in front as they were before or as far back as ABC was . You are going to end up with three very strong , competitive news organizations that will be relatively close to one another . There might be people who tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . We 'd love to be No. 1 because of what the world thinks it means . But we do intend to be the best news organization in television if we 're not already . Q. : What are your weaknesses ? A. : We have to continue to build and expand in new areas . We need to strengthen our business reporting , which we are in the process of doing . We need special correspondents for special areas like medicine and more science coverage . We have to go into greater depth in an awful lot of areas . Q. : flow are you planning to increase business coverage ? A. : It is quite possible that we will have a regular business section on that ( hourlong ) Sunday program . I would like to have a half hour every week devoted strictly to business .... There is a perception that is many times true on the part of business that television only presents business stories when there is a scandal or inordinate profits . I 'd like to do a program on the difficulties that American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many business stories that television has n't found a place for . Q. : It is widely rumored that National Broadcasting Co. approached you as possible replacement for NBC president Fred Silverman . Is that true ? A. : No . I have n't talked to anybody . All the rumors are untrue .
