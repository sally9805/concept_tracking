State universities try to cut the high cost of failure <P> The board of admissions for California 's vast public university system has sent a warning letter to the parents of all the eighth-grade students in the state : " Your son or daughter , " it declares , " should be expected to enroll in an English class every semester of every year and most students should be taking a math class every semester . " U.C. Administrator Henry Alder stresses that low performance in high school could prove hazardous to college aspirations . Reason : by the fall of 1984 the state 's 19 colleges and nine universities plan to toughen entrance requirements . The most dramatic new demands will occur at the state college level , where admissions will require 15 units of college-track subjects , including four years of college preparatory English and two years of math . <P> California is not the only state system toughening up its entrance requirements . Next fall Florida State University will demand that freshmen graduate from high school with a 2.5 grade-point average ( as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with 800 ) on the combined math and English Scholastic Aptitude Tests . Ohio State University , which since 1902 has guaranteed entrance to any Ohio high school graduate , will now accept unconditionally only students who have completed a college-preparatory curriculum that includes four years of English and three of math , science and social studies , plus a foreign language . Both the University of Tennessee and the University of Texas at Austin , where the number of students is rapidly outstripping resources , are planning to reduce the student body by tightening admissions requirements . <P> All over the country the high cost of higher education and the current reduction in state and federal aid are forcing public university systems to rethink an egalitarian admissions philosophy . For more than a decade , open admissions attracted many talented people who might never have had the chance for a college education . But it also saddled many schools with students woefully unprepared to do college work . The cost of remedial education has skyrocketed . Says Leon Mayhew , vice chancellor for the University of California at Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money spent . The other cost is in the misdirection of talents in teaching . " While some remedial programs hire specially trained teachers , many untenured-and frustrated-Ph.D.s find themselves teaching basic reading and Algebra I rather than literature or calculus . Adds California State University Chancellor Glenn Dumke : " Either the state university will direct its energy to the full meaning of ' higher education ' or its campuses will continue being made into centers of remediation.
