Angry at its leftist tilt , the U.S. pulls out <P> It was mid-afternoon when Jean Gerard , U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , and Richard Ahern , deputy chief of the U.S. delegation , left the U.S. mission in Paris for a short limousine ride to UNESCO 's concrete-and-glass headquarters . They took an elevator to the fifth floor , where UNESCO 'S Senegalese Director-General , Amadou Mahtar M'Bow , has his office . There they gave him a three-page letter , typed on U.S. delegation stationery . M'Bow barely glanced at it . " I will read this with great interest , " he said , smiling stiffly . Gerard and Ahern turned and left . <P> The absence of diplomatic niceties was appropriate . The letter , signed by Secretary of State George Shultz and authorized by President Reagan , held no surprises . After three years of discontent and six months of intensive review , the Administration last week formally withdrew the U.S. from UNESCO . Declared Gregory Newell , Assistant Secretary for International Organization Affairs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . It has exhibited hostility toward a free society , especially a free market and a free press , and it has demonstrated unrestrained budgetary expansion . " <P> Despite its high-decibel pullout , the Administration left the door open for reentry . UNESCO requires a member to give at least a year 's notice before resigning , so the U.S. withdrawal does not take effect until Dec. 31,1984 . The U.S. would consider rescinding its action , wrote Shultz , given " indications of significant improvement " in the way UNESCO operates . <P> That is unlikely . When UNESCO was founded in 1945 , the agency 's goals were high-minded enough : fostering literacy and education , preserving mankind 's cultural heritage , promoting the exchange of scientific ideas . But as Third World nations became a more potent force in the U.N. , the organization took a leftward turn . The first real scuffle came in 1974 , when UNESCO voted to exclude Israel from a regional working group because it allegedly altered " the historical features of Jerusalem " during archaeological excavations and " brainwashed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's appropriations , which forced the agency to soften its sanctions . In 1976 Israel was readmitted ; in 1977 U.S. funding resumed . <P> In 1980 , at the UNESCO general conference in Belgrade , a majority of Communist and Third World nations called for a " new world information order " to compensate for the alleged pro-Western bias of global news organizations . The goals were the licensing of journalists , an international code of press ethics and increased government control over media content . Although UNESCO backed off under pressure from the West , it still allocated $16 million for a two-year program to study " media reforms . " <P> The U.S. also chafed at UNESCO 's increasingly collectivist outlook . The agency 's charter , like that of the U.N. , commits its members to support basic human rights . In the past five years , however , the " rights of peoples " - in other words , the state-have taken priority over " individual " rights .                   @ @
