It was an afternoon in late August of 1973 when I held my first . and only , conversation with General Augusto Pinochet . At the time , of course , I had no way of knowing that he would all too soon become the master of my life and my country . Those were the tense , waning days of Chile 's experiment in creating socialism through peaceful means , and our democratically elected president , Salvador Allende , was fighting a losing battle against the forces that would soon overthrow him . As an unofficial adviser to Fernando Flores , Allende 's chief of staff , I spent a lot of time at La Moneda , ? the colonial building in the capital of Santiago that houses the offices of the executive branch . That afternoon I was trying to work out with Flores a way to involve some singers and writers in a government media campaign in supAriel Dorfman is Research Professor of Laerature and Latin American Studies at Duke University . His collection of stories , My House Is on Fire , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phone rang . Flores had stepped away from his desk for a few minutes , so I picked up the receiver . When a gruff voice demanded the chief of staff , I asked who it was . The answer was impatient and abrupt : " El General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte. " 1 was duly impressed and buzzed Flores immediately . Pinochet had just been named commander in chief of the army . He was thought to be one of the few generals still committed to civilian rule , still willing to oppose what seemed to be an imminent coup . When there was a coup , less than two weeks later , it was led , as the world now knows , by the man whose voice I had fleetingly heard over the phone . I have had many years to brood over the other phone calls he must have made in the days that followed : the call ordering fierce Hawker Hunters to bomb the presidential palace , where Allende died ; the call ordering the Chilean Congress disbanded ; the call to arrest Orlando Letelier and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fernando Ortiz and the call to cut the throat of Jose Manuel Parada . From afar ? from the distance of my exile , which began in December 1973 when I fled the crackdown of a military that had publicly burned my books ? that voice started to take on for me satanic dimensions . When I read in a human-rights report that in the first year of the dictatorship 180,000 people had been summarily detained , and that an estimated 90 percent of them were reported to have been tortured ; when I greeted in France my friend Oscar Castro , expelted from Chile after a two-year term in a prison camp for having staged an antimiIitary play , and tried to console him about his mother 's disappearance at the hands of the secret police ; when 1 would read in one paper or another that 27 percent of Chile 's population was receiving 3.3 percent of the country 's total income and would try to conjure from these dry statistics the desperate hunger of the poor always it was Pinochet and Pinochet and Pinochet who was responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person I blamed ( aware as I was that many men were behind him ) for Chile 's suffering and de-spair ? and for my not being able to return to my land or live a normal life while away ? he remained for me , at the same time , strangely ethereal , al-most unreal . I had photos of him clipped from the Chilean papers I combed for news and even had some of his speeches on tape , but all of this had the curious effect of making him seem even more disembodied , dis-tant . He was for me corporeal only in the utter naked intensity of those three brief innocent seconds when I had heard his voice over the phone . He was everything , and Iwas permitted to return to Chile nothing . for the first time in September 1983 , 1 had always imagined that this first trip back would coincide with the return of democracy ? even , perhaps , with a Pinochet trial , the general exposed to public scrutiny and scorn for crimes against humanity . In September 1983 , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet strangely , it turned out that even in . Santiago , Pinochet was everything and nothing . Few of my friends had ever caught a glimpse of him . He lived behind an imposing wall of security . He lived , as I did , at a distance from Chile or do I mean to say he kept the Chile I had known at a distance from its people ? I was returning to a land of exiles , men and women who inhabited a place that bore scant resemblance to the country in which they had been horn . It was one evening during that trip , as I was returning to uptown Santiagofrom one of the city 's miserable shantytowns , that I finally saw General Pinochet for the first time ? or saw at least part of him . I had spent most of the afternoon with a group of poor youngsters . They told me of brutal police raids , of the lack of jobs ( for in that zone of Santiago the unemployment rate was estimated to he 70 percent ) . Some spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape . My brother-in-law had driven me to that slum , and on our way back , at the exact intersection of the streets Antonio Varas and Eleodoro Yariez , our car was brought to a halt by a screeching siren and a hive of braking motorcycles . " It 's Pinochet , its Pinochet , " my brother-in-law murmured urgently . A caravan of black cars raced by , and just as they passed us , a white-gloved hand darted out of one of the windows and waved , in the typical gesture of dignitaries acknowledging a cheering crowd . It was absurd , because there was nobody there except us . And then he was gone . An apparition . Pinochet , of course , had no idea that I was watching him . And yet I felt that Pinochet was mocking me ? that his ghostly hand in the dusk was gesturing defiantly : I am here to stay , this is as near as you and your kind will ever get to me , this is the only farewell you will ever see from me. rive years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world also knows ? the people of Chile found a way of telling Pinochet that perhaps , after ail , he was not to be a permanent part of their lives . They used a plebiscite , one the general himself had confidently scheduled years before , to vote No ? no to military rule , no to Pinochet . The following day , hundreds of thousands of those voters ( I was among them ) streamed into the streets of Santiago , and some of us marched to the presidential palace waving handkerchiefs as white as his glove mocking him , bidding him adieu . Adios , General , we shouted to the man we still could not see . Adicis , General . No vuelva nunca nuts ? never come back again . It was a magical mo-I ment , as if the man who was inside those walls would indeed fade instantly and forever from our lives . That very same night , however , the general made a regal appearance . On television , dressed in full uniform , he conceded that the opposition had won this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resign . On March 11 , 1990 , he would hand over the presidency to the winner of a new , open election , to be held in December 1989 . Meanwhile , he was informing us : I will he around . He has been around . Weakened , unable to stop the presidential election , which Patricio Aylwin , the candidate of a coalition of opposition parties , Concertacien de Partidos por la Democracia ( CPD ) , is expected to win comfortably , the general has spent his last long months in office making sure that his ghostly presence will continue . That hand I saw way . ing at me in the crepuscular Santiago light has been carefully binding the country up , leaving it hien atado , well tied . He has been carefully fastening a series of knots that will obstruct and entangle Aylwin 's efforts to truly democratize the country . Economic knots : the change in status of the Central Bank that will allow it to dictate monetary policy independently of the new government , and some of whose directors can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electoral laws allow him to name 9 of 38 senators and all but 16 of the land 's 325 mayors , and to gerrymander legislative districts so that ultraconservatives can be elected with a third of the votes that an opposition candidate needs . He has also offered exceptionally munificent retirement benefits to several members of the country 's Supreme Court , which can declare laws unconstitutional . This has allowed him to name younger judges for life , all of them fervid Pinochet supporters . Terror knots : Death squads ? linked to Pinochet in the past ? have again sprung into action . A prominent left-wing politician was murdered recently . Military knots : Pinochet has announced his intention of remaining commander in chief of the army for another eight years . From that post , he can threaten to intervene each time the new government tries to loosen his other knots and , more ominously , can threaten another coup if , say , as happened in Argentina , military men are put on trial for torturing and disappearing . Aylwin has stated quite clearly that his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he will seek to overturn each piece of antidemocratic legislation enacted after the October 1988 plebiscite . Even if many of Pinochet 's knots can he painfully untied , it means that a great part of the democratic energies of Chile , instead of being directed to undoing the more terrible legacies of Pinochet ? for instance , the " trickle down " effects on the poor of Chile 's $16.7 billion foreign debt , the second largest per capita debt in Latin America ? must still first be expended on simply trying to get the man responsible for these calamities out of the way . Still , Pinochet 's power has been receding , and as it has we have gotten a stark and satisfying view of the forces behind him , forces in no way as immaculate as his white glove . The secret police are feuding among themselves ; former members thought ro be willing to testify at trials for human-rights violations have been threatened or gunned down . The right-wing forces that backed Pinochet are in disarray , bitterly divided between those who want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to continue them . ( It is this division that has allowed maior changes in the constitution to be arranged , in spite of Pinochet 's desperate attempts to foil them . ) And , although editors and producers still hear Pinochet 's voice on the other end of intimidating phone calls ? he recently saw to it that a noted television reporter was booted for having been " too soft " on Aylwin ? he can not stop the media from reporting the opposition 's criticism of his dictatorship . For Chileans , many of whom for years shut their eyes to the general 's mistakes and abuses , a more detailed profile of the man who has ruled them since 1973 is gradually coming into focus . Above all , it is the psychological climate that has changed in Chile . This is particularly true for those who never shut their eyes . After such a long time quietly struggling to oust him , putting their lives on the line , almost incredulous at having survived his incessant repression , people are breathing serenely , trying to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy a task as it may seem . Chile has been marked indelibly by Pinochet . I have visited my country a number of times in recent years , staying as long as six months . And on every visit I have observed the consequences of his misrule . A generation has grown up without knowing what democracy or freedom is , and a country has had to learn to bite its tongue and live with uncertainty , humiliation , terror . Unbridled pollution , countless slums where extended families share two-room shacks , hospitals without bandages or penicillin , thousands of beggars exploring garbage dumps in search of food , delinquency rising each year , eyes that avoid looking directly at you , bowed shoulders : over and over , signs of a ravaged land . Pinochet will haunt every effort at redressing this situation . The consequences of extraordinary evil , such as child abuse , tend to live on , often for generations . Who has not seen the flocks of psychologists descending upon the victims of a hostage-taking , or upon schoolchildren terrorized by a gunman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in a fast-food restaurant ? Who has not heard it said that some of those who have experienced this trauma may be scarred for life ? Pinochet has held my country hostage for more than sixteen years . His shadow was cast on every activity , every thought . This was most obviously true for those he could damage at the snap of his fingers because they remained " inside . " But it was true as well for those of us who spent the years abroad , in relative safety , far from immediate retaliation . Even for exiles , Pinochet , by taking possession of our landscape and the people we loved , became the owner of our future ? unless , that is , we were prepared to turn our backs on the suffering of our country and become indifferent . A dictatorship has a perverse effect Write or on a nation used to democracy . Nor-mality is taken away from every-body-from those who , out of fear , weariness , or self-interest , blind themselves to what is happening and become apathetic , hopeless , guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dedicate their lives to get-ting rid of the dictator and fill their existence with his presence , leaving space for hardly anything more ; and from all the rest , the majority who fluctuate between ignorance and re-sistance . In all cases , the general weighs at the center of one 's life , a dark anchor narrowing the range of every choice . Thus , it will be difficult to grow accustomed to his absence . He is burned into our memory , into our customs , into the way we speak , into our dreams . How are his dictator is our creature . We we to exorcise him ? Chileans created the conditions that allowed him to take power . We continue to grapple with him and his legacy . He will be exorcised . Enough people in Chile believed that Pinochet was not here to stay and were ready to G ) risk their lives for that belief . There has not been one moment of his awful reign when part of Chile has nor been resisting him , creating inner zones as wed as more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been one moment when he was not defied by thousands of Chileans who , if they could not organize their lives as if he did not exist , were able to act as if he had already been defeated . Although I can not shake from my head and heart the feeling that the general , like the worst nightmares , may well be with us forever , 1 also trust that perhaps my fractured visions of him-the disembodied voice , those faded newspaper clippings , the white , white glove-were , after all , prescient , prophetic . Could it not be that the voice on the phone and the gloved hand waving are the exact metaphors ' Is it not true that , in the final analysis , he is departing because he was never wholly among us ?
