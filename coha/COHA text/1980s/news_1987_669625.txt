All that changed one day in 1904 , when the first editor , Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor , suddenly had 11 pages to fill . He idly opened up a bulky envelope bearing exotic postage . Out spilled 50 first-ever photographs of the mysterious city of Lhasa in Tibet , taken by explorers for the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. // // Filling pages of a serious magazine with a spread of nontechnical photos just wasn ' t done then ; Grosvenor expected to get fired . Instead , people stopped him on the streets to thank him. // The rest , as they say , is history . The magazine that started out as a dry and technical journal has become over the course of a century a familiar fixture on coffee tables and in classrooms . The third-largest magazine in the country , and read in 167 out of 174 countries , National Geographic has been instrumental in shaping the way we view other cultures and creating a sense of awe at the beauty , order , and sometimes , cruelty of nature. // This year is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking both to the past and to the future. // The society has commissioned author C.D.B. Bryan to record the enormous changes it and the magazine have gone through in this last century . Mr. Bryan , a 1986 Guggenheim fellow and author of ' ' Friendly Fire , ' ' produced ' ' The National Geographic Society : 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery ' ' ( Harry N. Abrams Inc . , New York , 1987 ; 484 pp. ; $45 ) . // A massive book that will topple flimsy coffee tables , it ' s crammed with the magazine ' s now-famous , sumptuously colored photographs of explorers reaching summits , earthquakes and famines , quirky habits of animals , and the peoples of multitudinous cultures. // The magazine ' s illustrious history began with 33 explorers , biologists , military officers , and educators , who joined to form the National Geographic Society at a time when America was , as Bryan put it , having a ' ' love affair with science . ' ' Its second president was the inventor of the telephone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over 70 years in which the images people saw , the first impressions they had of foreign lands , came from pages of magazines like the National Geographic , ' ' Bryan says . ' ' It was the first to show the wildlife in Africa , the ancient towers and churches , photographs of Antarctica and the Arctic . It was the window on the world for the armchair explorer. ' ' // The society drew a lot of armchair explorers ; membership is now 10. 5 million . One of the keys to its success , says Bryan , was Alexander Graham Bell ' s unique concept of membership : One didn ' t merely subscribe to a magazine ; one was invited to become a member of the society , and received the magazine as its official journal . The circle of scientific elite invited their friends , and the circle widened until perplexed Midwest farmers were receiving the heavy , embossed invitations proclaiming , ' ' I have the honor of informing you that you are nominated for membership. . . . ' ' // What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe brought to them on paper by a host of intrepid explorers . Comdr . Robert E. Peary , Charles Lindbergh , Amelia Earhart , Jacques Cousteau , Thor Heyerdahl , and Edmund Hillary are a few who charted the ocean ' s murky depths and oxygen-thin mountain summits. // Some were characters as well as trailblazers : There was the Viennese botanist Joseph F. Rock , who disappeared for years into the remote borderlands between Tibet and China . He bathed every night in an Abercrombie &; Fitch folding bathtub and played Enrico Caruso records to mountain tribesmen. // One of Rock ' s tale ' s begins , ' ' I was quartered in the center of the village in a miserable old temple full of coffins . Darkness came on at midnight . The officers came in and announced that the brigands were outside and that the town could not be held against the impending attack . I never spent such a night in all my life. ' ' // If the explorers were daring , the magazine often was not , as Bryan says . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the ongoing theme was not to publish anything partisan . ' ' It lent a certain blandness to the reporting , ' ' says Bryan . The magazine got flak for not seeing the dangers of fascism early on , and for presenting a view of Harlem through rose-colored glasses. // But if Geographic was looking at the world through rose-colored glasses , says Bryan , so was America. // They ' re more courageous today , dipping into advocacy journalism in articles like ' ' Wild Cargo : the Business of Smuggling Animals , ' ' and ' ' Acid Rain - How Great A Menace ? ' ' // The current mission is to encourage readers and students to develop a critical sense of the role geography plays in defining their world. // ' ' I feel that geography drives history , ' ' says president Gilbert M. Grosvenor . ' ' I suspect that had our leaders really understood the geohistory of Vietnam and Southeast Asia , I ' m not sure we would have gone into that country , or at least the way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the real attraction of Ho Chi Minh , the relationship between the Viet Cong and the rest of Indochina , as it was then called. ' ' // Appalled by reports of geographical illiteracy in the classroom , the society has launched a multifaceted Geography Education Program. // One project is a summer teachers ' workshop started two years ago . Mr. Grosvenor says 30 percent of teachers teaching geography never took a geography course . Teachers from 22 states ( so far ) spend a month soaking up geography through lectures and workshops. // Other projects include a computer network that links up students around the country to work on science projects , and an interactive videodisc that permits teachers and students to program their own lessons. // While much of Earth ' s mass has been studied in the last century , the adventures aren ' t over , says Grosvenor . They ' ve just taken on new forms : There are modern-day explorers retracing the Crusaders ' path by horseback , the steps of Sinbad the Sailor , or St. Brendan ' s famous voyage across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine ' s once all-male bastion has opened its ranks to women , who are now getting stories that men would not be able to get , like photographer Julie Cobb ' s story on life behind the veil of the women of Saudi Arabia. // ' ' The same spirit that drove Livingstone and the great explorers in Africa the last 100 years or so , ' ' Grosvenor says , ' ' that same spirit will drive man to explore in the modern sense of the word , in the next century . ' ' We will discover ancient civilizations and learn more about our past , which I think we all admit is extremely important for looking ahead. ' ' // //
