Victories in Lebanon and the Falklands leave a wounded world <P> Perhaps all victories feel Pyrrhic , the winner 's sense of triumph sucked empty by the sight of bodies heaped like trash , herds of prisoners with hollow faces , children coughing in the rubble . Since every war winds up like this , nothing better could be expected of the latest two , the fighting coming to conclusions , or near conclusions , in the past week . Still , for several sides , things turned out pretty well . Britain closed in on Port Stanley , and won back the Falkland Islands . Israel closed in on Beirut , and may yet win safety for its northern borders . Lebanon , after its period of torment , may-with much luck and work-see its sovereignty restored . For its part , the U.S. has watched two allies come out on top in two displays of elegantly executed strategies . Better yet : the Soviets have been stung in Lebanon , the surface-to-air missiles they sold to the Syrians lying like scrap sculptures in the Bekaa Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would think there might at least be deep contentment in the mind . There is not . <P> That both these wars seem related at all is curious , given the blatant differences between them . The fight in the Falklands came as a shock , both for its ferocity and its stakes . The invasion of Lebanon surprised no one , except insofar as one is always surprised to see somebody do what he threatens to do . The Falklands are of purely symbolic importance to the contenders . Control of southern Lebanon is of vital practical advantage to each side . Between the British and the Argentines there was a history of compatibility ; between the Israelis and the P.L.O. , a history of hatred . Argentina is conservative and antiCommunist ; the P.L.O . radical and Communist supported . In the Falklands , the U.S. was watching friend fight friend ; in Lebanon , an ally was going up against an enemy that has little affection for the U.S. And there were the physical differences of climate ; of sea battles vs. land operations ; of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theaters , worlds apart . <P> In spite of all this , these two eruptions have a good deal in common . Their timing alone connects them . In a letter to President Reagan the day Israel invaded Lebanon , Prime Minister Begin cited the example of Britain 's act of self-defense , thus justifying his own nation 's move . Other analogies are more certain . Both the British and the Israelis applied short-term solutions to long-range problems . Both could have avoided armed conflict through negotiations ( though this would have been harder for the Israelis ) , but either because of carelessness , stubbornness , arrogance or suspicion , each chose not to . Both told their allies that what they were doing was good not only for themselves but for the world as well . Both saw themselves functioning as liberators . Both were responding to hostilities ; in the case of Britain , to a single overt act ; in the case of Israel , to a protracted state of danger . Both were thus in the right , from a particular point of view ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
