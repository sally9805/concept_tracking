THE VIOLENT death of driver Gordon Smiley at Indianapolis in May , only a week after the violent death of driver Gilles Villeneuve in Belgium , started a cascade of objections to motor racing , most of them based on the assumption that human beings are rational creatures , despite evidence to the contrary pouring in at the same time from the south Atlantic . In Time , Tom Callahan deplored the whole Indy enterprise : " Some 450,000 people , " he wrote , " will perch or picnic at the Speedway on Sunday . Nobody knows how many of them are ghouls spreading their blankets beside a bad intersection . " This reprehension of ghoulishness was attended by four gruesome color photographs intended specifically to gratify the ghoul in all of us . At the same time , Frank Deford was setting off his antiIndy blast in Sports Illustrated , finding the race not a sport but a mere hustling of automotive products ( " The drivers at Indy look much less like athletes than like a lot of congested billboards " ) . He concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarians . " George Vecsey , in the sports pages of The New York Times , suggested that the Indy race is becoming too dangerous to be regarded as a sport . " I can see accidents , " he said , " on the Long Island Expressway . " Were these people right ? Is the Indy 500 a sporting event , or is it something else ? And if something else , is it evil or benign ? Paul Fussell is the author of The Boy Scout Handbook and Other Observations , a collection of essays from Harper 's and elsewhere , to be published in the fall by Oxford University Press . LTHOUGH the automotive industry moved to Detroit early in this century , Indianapolis is still a motor city , swarming with car washes and auto-parts stores , and the sign on the road into town from the airport , WELCOME TO INDIANAPOLIS : CROSSROADS OE AMERICA , seems to imply that you 're entering a place best reached by car . Here , nobody walks . One day I walked two and a half miles along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour found myself literally the only person not in an automobile . Returning a few hours later , I was still the only walker , with the exception of a man who accosted me and tried to borrow sixty-two cents . To a Northeasterner , Indianapolis seems at first to be a strangely retrograde repository of piety and patriotism . When I arrived , an editorial in the only paper in town was raising a populist voice in a call for school prayer , and a front-page box offered " Today 's Prayer , " just above " Today 's Chuckle . " After a short sojourn in Indianapolis one is no longer surprised at the imperious sign in the store window , GO TO CHURCH SUNDAY . Catholics wishing to arrive at the race very early Sunday morning , like everyone else , have their needs taken care of by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis , which has ruled that they may fulfill their holy Sunday obligation " by attending Mass the evening before . " Indianapolis seemed to me the sort of place where President Reagan expects no one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my prayers . " In fact , the president would love the place . Driving to the Speedway , the motorist passes a billboard advertising ( of course ) cars , but shouting also GOD BLESS muddy stretch of ground in the infield at the first turn , known as the Snake Pit . These are the ones who , when girls pass , spiritlessly hold up signs reading SHOW US YOUR TITS . The uglies are sometimes taken to be the essence of Indy , and they are the people who , I think , Frank Deford has in mind when he speaks of " barbarians . " But they are not the significant Indy audience . The middle class is , all those people arriving at the Speedway in cars bearing Purdue and Indiana State stickers . The middles are privileged to participate in an exclusive social event , the classy pit promenade . Beginning three hours before the start , anyone who can wangle a pit pass strolls slowly up and down in the space between the pits and the track proper , all dressed up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of his social inferiors in the stands . On race morning in Indianapolis this is the stylish place to be , a place where one would n't dare show oneself unshaven or in dirty clothes . Many spandy-clean black-and-white getups are to be seen there , including trousers with two-inch black-and-white squares . Even though the social tone is compromised a bit by the presence of representatives of the press ( that 's how I got there ) , the thing struck me as comparable with some of the great snob social operations of the world , like appearing in or near the royal box at Ascot or nodding to well-dressed friends while strolling slowly down the Champs Elysees . But this promenade wasfor middle-class people . The upper-middle class is not to be found at Indy . If you 're the sort of person drawn to Forest Hills , or the Test Matches at Lord 's , or the Americas Cup Races at Newport , you 're not likely to be seen at the Speedway . From the outset , devotees of auto racing have felt anxieties about its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a par with cockfighting and mud wrestling , or up there with football and perhaps even badminton ? The surprise registered by an Indianapolis paper after the 1912 race speaks volumes , socially : " There has been no better-mannered gathering in Indianapolis . . . . There was no pushing , no crowding , no profanity , no discourtesies . " When the Chief Steward issues the portentous injunction , " Gentlemen , start your engines , " we may feel that the first word insists a bit too much . Presumably , if women drivers were to become a regular feature in the Indy , the formula would have to include " Ladies and . .. " Janet Guthrie , who has been on the premises , and has so far been the only woman to participate ( three times ) , says : " I think that racing 's image needs all the help it can get . It has traditionally been a lowbrow image . " Before being killed in the Austrian Grand Prix in 1975 , Mark Donohue , who had graduated not just from college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an anomaly he was there . " I was considered different from the other Indy drivers , " he said . " I had gone to college , I was articulate , and I did n't swear a lot . " HARPER'S/AUGUST 1982 The sense that racing will naturally sink prole-ward unless rigorously disciplined is what one takes away from a reading of the rule book promulgated by the United States Auto Club , the official supervisor of Indy racing . Cars are not to bear " undignified names , " " improper language or conduct " is forbidden , and everything must be neat and clean at all times , just the way a gentleman would want it : " Appearance : cars , crews , and all pit personnel whose appearance detracts from the character of the program may be excluded . " A similar aspiration to respectability seems to be partially responsible for euphemisms that abound at Indy . Just as the self-conscious middle class may remark that someone has " passed away " ( sometimes " over " ) , the Indy public-address announcer will inform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying there 's been a terrible smash-up on the third turn , he 'll say , " We have a yellow light . " A car never hits the wall , it " gets into " it , or even " kisses " it , and speakers aspiring to even greater tastefulness might observe that the driver has " visited Cement City . " Driver Danny Ongais , badly injured in a crash in 1981 , spoke of it this year not as the crash or even the accident but as " the incident . " Everywhere there is the gentleman 's feeling that if you pretend something has not happened , it has not . Thus the rule prohibiting cars to add oil during a race . Adding oil would publicly acknowledge , as racing journalist Terry Reed points out , " that a car is blowing ( or leaking ) its original supply on the track , making the course even more hazardous . " Almost immediately after Gordon Smiley 's body nauseatingly stained the wall , it was repainted , white and pure . Now his tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of white . As Danny Ongais 's indirection suggests , there are psychological as well as social reasons for all this euphemism . Racing is deadly dangerous , especially now that speeds around 200 miles an hour are the rule , which makes more true than ever Jackie Stew-art 's point : " Motor racing will always be dangerous because you are always going too fast for things around you . " Johnny Rutherford adds : " Very few drivers ? maybe only a handful ? are capable of running 200 miles an hour . " An example of one guy who was n't , some say in Indianapolis , was the late Gordon Smiley . At least that 's the way they rationalize in order to admit no defect in the conditions , only in the weaker aspirants , thus making racing seem a wholesome and natural illustration of Darwinian selection . A pervasive atmosphere of risk enshrouds a top driver 's professional life . Jackie Stewart had occasion to realize , in June 1970 , that in the past months he 'd " seen more of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks after Jimmy died , it was Mike Spence at Indianapolis ; four weeks later , another friend , Ludovico Scarfiotti ; four weeks more , to the day , it was Jo Schlesser in Rouen ; and two weeks ago , Bruce McLarenat Goodwood . Now it 's Piers . It just keeps on . " The USAC rule book says explicitly that " Automobile racing is a hazardous undertaking , " and it implies it all the way through , as when it notes that all drivers are required to remove dentures before starting or when it lays down precise specifications for easily detached steering wheels , " to aid in removing injured drivers from cars . " HAVE BEEN genuinely scared quite a bit , most notably in the infantry during the Second World War , when shells whined inexorably closer and closer to my body and I waited for them finally to make contact and tear me to pieces . But a further moment of sheer terror occurred at eleven in the morning of May 22 , 1982 , the third day of qualifying at Indy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track itself and for the first time heard those cars screaming by just overhead . They give off not just an almost unbearable sudden noise , but shocking heat and concussion as well . In their appalling whoosh is the quintessential menace of the Machine . Not even an observer feels entirely safe at the Speedway , and indeed the spectators are in literal danger all the time ? from hurtling machines , tires , and fragments , and from the deadly methanol fuel , which burns with a scarcely visible flame , consuming ears and fingers before onlookers are even aware that the victim 's on fire . No wonder " 13 " is , by USAC edict , never used in car numbering . No wonder , either , that the rituals of the Indy world are strenuously male , macho as all get-out . Women , even wives and mistresses , were n't allowed in the pits until 1970 . In 1976 Janet Guthrie was hoping to enter the race . She could n't get her car to go fast enough to qualify , but on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , author of Indy : The World 's Fastest Carnival Ride , remembers , She is stopped by two slightly beer-crazed twentyyear-olds . " Hey , Janet , " one of them calls . " You gon na qualify ? " " 1 hope so , " she replies , smiling , perhaps a little nervously . " Well , we do n't , " the other boy calls back to her . " We hope you crash and burn where we can see you . " Actually , in order to understand precisely how male Indy is , you have only to scrutinize the famous Borg-Warner trophy , awarded annually to the winner . On top is a silver male figure ten inches tall , signaling the finish of a race by vigorously deploying a checkered flag . despite the curious fact that he 's stark naked and exhibiting a complete set of realistic genital organs , instead of what we might HARPER'S/AUGUST 1982 expect , a cache sexe consisting maybe of a windblown bit of fabric . There he stands , quite undraped ? unlike , say , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to see the ideal maleness toward which Indy aspires . The ideal whiteness , too . Indy , as Ron Dorson says , is " a show staged by white people for a white audience . " Blacks are so rare among the spectators that you notice them specifically , and of course there are no black drivers , nor threat of any . ( There was once a Jewish driver , Mauri Rose , but that 's another story . ) At a local cocktail party I broached the black topic as politely as I could and was told by one lady that blacks abjured the race because you had to sit for hours in the hot sun , and , as is well known , blacks ca n't bear to sit in the sun . Phoned for his views , the local NAACP spokesman fulminated , asserting that the situation is a scandal but that all black representations have been ineffective . Once Indy is over , and the Speedway emptied for another year , you see a lot of blacks there , working for a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves ( together with odd left-behinds like sets of teeth and , each time , two or three cars inexplicably abandoned forever in the infield ) . The combined weight of the litter suggests the size of the crowd , estimated ( since the Speedway does not issue a precise count ) at around 400,000 . And the size of the crowd suggests one other thingthat 's being celebrated . A name for it would be gigantism . It is the biggest of everything , " the largest single-day sporting event in the world , " as local publicity says . And , as Roger Penske adds , for the drivers it 's " the biggest race in the world to win " ; both the purse and the publicity are the largest . There is more press coverage ? over 4,000 media people are there ? than of any similar event . So gigantic is the track that a spectator can see only a tiny segment of it . Thus the public-address announcer is indispensable , performing over ( naturally ) " the world 's largest public-address system " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every event is mediated through language : " We have a yellow light . " The Indy public-address and radio announcers have always become public personages , even stars , and young Paul Page , who succeeded Sid Collins as the radio " Voice of the Indianapolis Five Hundred , " is as famous there as , say , George Steinbrenner in New York . It 's not just the announcing that makes Indy so curiously a language event . It 's the advertising , the sight of grown men proud to be walking around in caps that say VALVOLINE or GOODYEAR . The cars themselves , plastered with decals ( CHAMPION , DIEHARD , STP ) , have been called , by somewhat heavy wits , " the world 's fastest billboards . " Officially , Indy is a celebration of " progress " in the motor-car and rubber-tire industries , a testing ground for improvements destined to make their way into your passenger car . Unofficially , it 's a celebration of the charm of brand names , of their totemic power to confer distinction on those who wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power by wearing the right T-shirt or cap and thus allying yourself with successful enterprises like BUDWEISER or GATORADE . By the use of " legible clothing , " as Alison Lurie calls it , you fuse your private identity with external commercial success , redeeming your insignificance and becoming , for the moment , somebody . Even the lucky wearers of the coveted pit passes are allowed to feel this sort of power , for the badges , not content to be merely what they are , are also little ads for CHEVROLET CAMARO . A person who could n't read ( a real " barbarian , " maybe ) would get very little out of Indy . OBVIOUSLY there 's much more going on here than is commonly imagined by the " Eastern press , " and there 's certainly more going on than an overpowering desire to see someone killed . There is a powerful and , in my view , benign element of ritual purgation about Indy , and the things purged are precisely such impurities as vulgarity , greed , snobbery , and sadism . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same order and with the same delft , - erate , ample timing , are enough to hint at this ritual element . It is a Sunday morning , a time once appropriated for rituals of purgation . When I asked why the race was run on Sunday despite protests from the local Baptists about profaning the Sabbath , and the inconvenience of closed liquor stores , I was told that Monday , a holiday , was always available as a rain date . But the race seems to gravitate to Sunday for deeper reasons . We 've entered the Speedway very early , at 7:00 or 8:00 in the morning , although the crazies will have poured in , already blotto on beer and clad in T-shirts proclaiming the wearer TOO DRUNK TO FUCK , when the gates open at 5:00 . We 're all anticipating the hour of start , 11:00 , the hour when , formerly , church services began . By 9:30 virtually everyone involved in the unvarying prestart ceremonies is in place . At 9:45 , as ? I 'm quoting the official program ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wabash , ' " the cars , still inert , silent , dead things , a threat to no one , are pushed by hand from the pits to their starting positions on the too narrow track , where they are formed up in eleven rows of a viciously hazardous but thoroughly traditional three-abreast arrangement . At 10:34 the Chief Steward makes a stately circuit in the pace car , inspecting the track for impurities one last time . At 10:44 , all rise : " The Star-Spangled Banner . " At 10:47 , heads bowed for the invocation , delivered by a local divine , who prays for a safe race and reminds us of the dead of all our wars ? and of all past Indys . One minute later " Taps . " It is Memorial Day , one suddenly remembers . Two minutes after " Taps , " the band plays , quite slowly , " Back Home Again in Indiana . " By this time I am crying , for me always an empirical indication , experienced at scores of weddings and commencements , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booming voice issued its command to the gentlemen , I was ready to be borne out on a litter , and the race had n't even started yet . If , while witnessing these things , you come to understand that Indy has something more to do with Memorial Day than coincidence , you also realize that there 's some evanescent ritual meaning in the event 's occurring at the moment recognized as the division between spring and summer . For Dan Gerber , listening as a boy annually to the Voice of the Indianapolis Five Hundred meant ? release . " It meant school was getting out and I could get sunburned and go fishing and spend three months on Lake Michigan . " For me , likewise , as an adult , as far away I used to listen stretched out in the sun on that weekend , it meant school was out : university was over for that year , I 'd finally turned the grades in , no more pressure , no more anxiety about treating someone unfairly until we resumed in the fall . Indy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corps of 600 ushers , " is spring tonic to me . " I know what he means . As with a great many contemporary experiences , the meaning of Indy is elusive because it wo n't fit familiar schemes of classification . The rationalist , trying to make sense of its competitive elements , concludes that news about it belongs on the sports page . But then Warner Wolf , the TV sports commentator , appalled by the destruction of Villeneuve and Smiley , argues that racing 's not a sport at all and indignantly defames it as merely a thing about machines . Although there probably is a legitimate sport called " motor sport , " indulged in largely by amateurs , Wolf is right in perceiving that what takes place at Indy is not a sport . The true nature of Indy is in its resemblance to other rituals in which wild , menacing , nonhuman things are tamed . I 'm thinking of the rodeo and the bullfight . Subduing beasts that , unsubdued , would threaten man ? that 's the ritual of rodeo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bullfight as well . Just like at Indy , you can get hurt trying to subdue wild horses , killed trying to dominate bulls . Virility , cojones figure in each of these , as the little silver man indicates they do at Indy . Warner Wolf is also right when he notes that Indy is a thing about machines , but it 's about machines only the way rodeos would be about broncos if no men were there to break them and bullfights about toros if no toreros were there to command them . Indy enacts the ritual taming and dominating of machines , emphasizing the crucial distinction between man and machine , the one soft and vulnerable but quick with courage and resource , the other hard and threatening but cold and stupid . The cars are at Indy so that men can be shown to be capable of dominating them , and the wonder and glory of the dominators is the point . Indy is thus a great Sunday-morning proclamation of the dignity of man , and no number of discarded chicken bones or trampled beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indy insists that people are worth being saved . Do some people , regardless , come to see drivers killed ? Probably , but as irrelevant a tiny number of the sick as those who enjoy seeing a bullfight ruined by the bullfighter 's being gored . If you see someone die at Indy , you are seeing that the machine has won , and that 's opposed to everything the ritual is saying . A longtime student of the race , Sam Posey , seems to get the point when he addresses the pleasure spectators take in identifying themselves with the driver-tamer of the machine . When things go wrong and the crowd sees a driver killed , he says , " They are terribly shocked and extremely depressed . They wish they had not been there . " What the spectator wants to see ? needs to see ? ? is the machine crashing , disintegrating , wheels flying off , and in the end the man springing out and waving " I 'm okay . " " Because that 's the moment of the greatest thrill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine . The machine has bitten back , but the man HARPER'S/AUGUST 1982 jumps out laughing and therefore the spectator 's dream of immortality is confirmed . " Immortality : hence , value , and value much longer lasting than the value conferred on congeries of steel , aluminum , and rubber by the mere age of the machine . WAS at Indy during a week when every day brought worse news of young people 's limbs blown off in the south Atlantic , and perhaps the contrast between that spectacle and the Greatest Spectacle in Racing made Indy seem especially therapeutic . No one was hurt all the time I was there , the only injuries being sunburns and hangovers . I went there looking for something mean , but all I found was something innocent . The spectators were the innocents persuaded that the space shuttle promises great things , the same innocents who lost much of their money by putting it into United States Savings Bonds . If Indy is in one sense about beer , in a deeper sense it 's about milk . A full-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local Indiana Dairy Farmer , " announced that milk is ' ' the Drink of Champions " and noted that " over the past six years milk has powered the ' Fastest Rookie . ' " Indy , the program also said , is " An American Tradition . " I 'm glad it is.
