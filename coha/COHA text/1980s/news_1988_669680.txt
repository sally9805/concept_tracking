The technical sergeant from Pennsylvania had spent much of the war entertaining his fellow GIs in Italy with some talented strumming on a guitar . Once he had even accompanied the glamorous Marlene Dietrich when she appeared in Naples. // But now Sergeant Peters was recuperating in a military hospital . He suddenly found himself with little to interest him . . . until he stumbled across a ' ' very special ' ' book in the hospital library . It listed 20 , 000 careers in alphabetical order. // // At the time Peters had little idea what profession to pursue once the war was over , so he began with the letter ' A. ' When he reached ' F , ' he stopped. // Nothing had captured his imagination until he came across the term ' ' floraculture . ' ' Its effect on him was instantaneous and surprising , because as a youngster he had done no gardening beyond helping his mother plant some of her spring-flowering bulbs. // Even so , he felt instinctively that he had found the career he would follow. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the book , Peters would never know . In any event he ' s had reason to be very satisfied with the direction floraculture has taken him in the intervening years. // Peters ' Professional Plant Food company , which he founded in 1952 , has led the way in dry soluble fertilizer development for the greenhouse industry in the United States . Currently it supplies more product to the greenhouse trade than all others combined . Exports , long a significant earner for the company , have increased in recent years with the decline of the dollar. // But what is an established success story today had some rather wobbly beginnings in the early post war years. // After graduating from the Long Island Institute of Agriculture in Farmingdale , N.Y. , where plant nutrition was his major interest , Peters set up a soil testing service. // This was the way of the future , he could see , and his newly aquired skills would surely prove invaluable . It was a flawed assumption . A $3 , 000 investment in direct mailing to 16 , 000 commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his message on the road in a surplus Army jeep bought with $350 of borrowed money . He would be an on-site consultant , but the first grower ' s response was a blunt : ' ' We don ' t need that . ' ' The next five said very much the same thing. // At the end of the year he had earned exactly $258 for his services . If it hadn ' t been for understanding parents-in-law , with whom he and his wife stayed , he would have been out of business almost as fast as he went in. // Then something fortunate happened. // Growers , particularly carnation producers , who were plentiful at the time , suddenly adopted soil sterilization , using steam . This saved them the effort of changing bench soils in the greenhouses every year . But it also threw soil fertility way out of whack . Suddenly Peters ' s skills were in demand , and the days of $2-a-night motel stops were soon a thing of the past. // Spurred on by the fact that the most suitable fertilizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began manufacturing - or rather blending - the various ingredients himself. // For the next eight years he was lab technician , blender , salesman , consultant , chief executive officer , and janitor all rolled in one . But he found the work to his liking and the company grew. // Again it was the carnation that helped Peters get established . His 20-5-30 ( nitrogen , phospherous , potassium ratio ) blend suited the needs of the once dominant flower to a tee . For this reason , Peters finds it regretful that carnation production has all but vanished from US shores. // The jet age , with its economy and speed of delivery , did in cut-flower production in North America he says , noting that most carnations now come from Central and South America , where lower wages and a more benign climate make for a cheaper end product. // Over the years Peters has developed a range of formulations for professional growers and the consumer that is not matched elsewhere in the industry . This is one reason why exports are increasing. // Bags of fertilizer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited his plant - were nearly all destined for growers in Holland. // Shrewd people the Dutch , says Peters with a grin . They import a low-cost item from the US , and a couple of months later export it back as high quality cut flowers. <> <> // IN the laboratory just in back of his office , Bob Peters pours room-temperature water into a clear glass beaker and adds the appropriate teaspoonful of fertilizer . A few stirs with a glass rod , and the water turns blue . Within three seconds the fertilizer is fully dissolved. // It must dissolve ' ' faster than sugar in hot coffee , ' ' or it doesn ' t meet the Peters standard. // Then comes the prime test for all water-soluble fertilizers : I place my hand behind the beaker and look through the blue-colored solution . The outline of my fingers is clearly visible . An hour later the clarity is still the same , and there is no accumulation of undissolved sediment at the bottom. // Any sediment that settles out after a ' ' soluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients ' ' that would not be available to the plant , ' ' Peters points out . To get such high solubility , fertilizers must be made of highly refined ' ' technical grade ' ' materials. // What results is a product with minimal impurities. // After decades in which farmlands and backyards alike have been overchemicalized , in the view of many , the question of purity with any soil treatment is taking on increasing importance. // Organic gardeners and farmers have long avoided anything but natural fertilizers with the contention that chemical fertilizers damage soil life. // But there is a small school of thought among them that questions this concept . Chemical fertilizers alone are not the problem , these adherents say , but rather the impurities , particularly chlorine , that inevitably accompany the cheaper , dry chemical fertilizers. // Philip Wheeler , of TransNational Agronomy Ltd. in Grand Rapids , Mich. , is one who thinks this way . While he promotes natural farming methods and soil building , he also sees a place for ' ' chemicals of high purity. ' ' // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as plants benefiting from judicious applications of high quality , water-soluble chemical fertilizers. // Numbers of beneficial bacteria , feeding on the freely available nutrients , jump dramatically within a day or two of the application , he says . As these bacteria die , they release the nutrients to the plants . In effect , the bacteria have taken a highly soluble chemical product and converted it into a slow-release , natural fertilizer that behaves much like rich compost. // Whatever the soil medium , Peters is a strong believer in the ' ' little-and-often ' ' approach to liquid fertilizing . Feeding a full-strength fertilizer solution every other week ( still a common practice ) provides a feast-or-famine situation for the plants in his view . ' ' A sudden burst of nutrients , ' ' he says , ' ' can sometimes shock a plant. ' ' // But the occasional fertilizing approach ( strong one week , none another ) can work well for plants with a soil rich in organic matter . These soils are so well buffered that plants are protected from the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
