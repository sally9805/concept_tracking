( ELISE 's place , a cramped apartment on the fifth floor of a dingy Greenwich Village walkup . MARTIN comes into the doorway , holding a valise . He surveys the room : unmade pullout sofa bed with ash tray on it , heaped with cigarette butts ; half-read books on side table . The only visible storage is a crudely made wall-length affair with rod for hanging clothes and a bureau at one end inside . A curtain , now open , runs its length when closed , concealing the clutter within . Across the window , in matching material , is a curtain pulled shut . When it is open , we can see part of a neon sign that runs vertically outside , showing the letters H-A-R and the top of an M for " Pharmacy " . It is the mid-1950s . MARTIN enters , sets down the valise and begins straightening up , folding bed away , etc . He is just sixteen , his face still boyish and open , but with a veiled , secretive quality which shows itself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . Noting the darkness of the room , he approaches the window to pull open the curtains . As he does so , ELISE enters and the room fills with light . MARTIN turns and sees her . ) MARTIN Mom ! ELISE Angel ! ( ELISE , breathless , sets down sketch case and shopping bag full of magazines. ) p. 3 ELISE Sorry I 'm late , they put us on double overtime again , have you been here long , God my feet are killing me , those stairs , let me look at you ! Just as I thought , the handsomest man in the universe . Welcome home , angel ! ( As they embrace , what sounds like Mexican bullfight music begins to play from next door , festive and bright . ELISE is in her early forties , with a gypsy-like beauty and a playful , seductive manner that is unconscious and natural . But there are also a poise and reserve about her that suggest a person who has learned to put a brave face on her loneliness . She is dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something handmade that , like all her clothing , shows her own unique sense of flair and style . At their embrace , the music swells from next door . ) ELISE Now then , first things first  --  how was the train ride down ? MARTIN Just a train ride . Why is it so hot in here ? ELISE It 's nearly summer , that 's why : Cold in winter , hot in summer , any complaints see the man in the moon . ( Through the following , ELISE sits , removes shoes , massages feet , checks frayed hem , then pulls magazines from shopping bag and sorts them into piles on the table . ) MARTIN I 'll open the window . p. 4 ELISE The noise will drown out Mrs. Salvatore 's music . She put her speakers right up against the wall especially for me , lovely neighbor , a gypsy , like your mother . MARTIN I 'll turn on the fan ELISE Stupid thing , two days after I had it repaired , kaput , a waste of money . Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payday , so a major decision has to be made about this evening  --  dinner or a movie , you choose . MARTIN I 'm seeing some friends from school . ELISE On your first night home ? MARTIN It was kind of last minute , on the train ride . ELISE What am I running here , a halfway house for transient teens ? MARTIN My summer job does n't start till next Monday and there 's an early train upstate , we have the whole week together ( MARTIN exits with his suitcase ) ELISE May I then expect the pleasure of his company on his last , if not his first night home ? MARTIN ( reenters ) Absolutely . ELISE Sunday night , make a note . p. 5 MARTIN ( smiles ) " Note . " ELISE Now tell me all about Parent 's Day . Did you read your essay out loud ? In front of the entire school ? Did they applaud , and anyone who did n't their name and address , I 'll deal with them personally . MARTIN It went fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now does n't that conjure a vivid picture , yes , I see it all MARTIN I 'll tell you while we eat , okay ? ELISE Excellent ! Raid the icebox , whatever you find , that 's dinner . ( Plops down some magazines conspicuously ) MARTIN Why the magazines ? ELISE ( reads titles ) Construction Quarterly  --  Contractor 's Annual  --  Perspectives in Extruded Plastic . These titles are sheer poetry . MARTIN ( on the way out ) Changing careers again ? ( exits ) ELISE Do n't be such a Smart Smerdley , your mother has had the inspiration of a lifetime . MARTIN ( off ) Not another one ! p. 6 ELISE ( loud ) We are about to possess a home of our own . I mean a real home , what do you say to that ? MARTIN ( off ) The others were n't real ? ELISE ( loud ) They were n't ours . ( Quieter ) The husband owns title , do n't ask me why . Hus-bands . When love goes wrong , we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pride . Tant pis pour moi . MARTIN ( off ) I ca n't hear you . ( ELISE flips through magazines , circling an item , dog-earing a page , etc . ) ELISE Are n't you sick of all this moving around ? Would n't it be lovely to live somewhere spacious and light and permanent where I could get back to my poetry and you had your own room for well , whatever . What are you up to out there , plotting the Revolution ? MARTIN ( off ) Of course , what else ? ELISE ( smiles ) You see , it 's all to do with these new materials they developed for the war . Now they 're looking like mad for peacetime markets , like house-building  --  only contractors wo n't use anything new until it 's proven , and how can you prove it till you use it . And that , my dear , is where we come in p. 7 MARTIN ( reenters with milk bottle half full ) This is all I could find . ELISE Milk ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years on nothing else , did you know that ? MARTIN It 's warm . ELISE As nature intended . Did you ever hear of a refrigerated cow ? MARTIN Is the icebox broken , too ? ELISE No , angel , there is nothing wrong with the icebox . Or the fan , for that matter . It 's the electric company , I do n't know what is the matter with those people MARTIN ( flipping wall switch ) The power 's been disconnected ? ELISE It was that or the phone . And since nothing exciting ever entered my life through the icebox , I paid the phone bill . MARTIN Mom , what do you live on ? ELISE ( snippy ) On the fact that I 'm putting you through school and you 'll have opportunities I never had . What a shame my Little Lord Fauntleroy missed the Depression , or he would n't be so quick to judge his own flesh and blood MARTIN Okay , take it easy , all I meant never mind . p. 8 ELISE What , angel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ambassador would come home glowing with triumph . MARTIN I guess I 'm just tired . It 's a long train ride down . Tell me your idea , I 'll get the glasses for dinner . ( ELISE watches his exit to kitchen . Something is up . ) ELISE I 'm approaching all the manufacturers with a proposition : They contribute their most controversial products from which I 'll offer to design and build The Home of The Future . They get a free showcase , we get a free house , and free enterprise triumphs once again . MARTIN ( reenters , holding two mismatched glasses to the light to check for dirt ) What do we build this house on ? ELISE On a piece of land , silly head , what else ? MARTIN And where do we get this piece of land ? ELISE In the fullness of time , all will be revealed : Sunday night . MARTIN What 's the big deal about Sunday , just tell me . ELISE ( teasing ) Curiosity killed the cat . MARTIN Mom , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream ? Where on earth do you pick up these curious expressions ? MARTIN You know what it means . ELISE Une rve du pipe ? Is that , for instance , when you send your son to one of the best progressive schools in the east and he 's failing nearly every subject at mid-year ? ( Teasingly ) Plus caught drinking in the science lab ? And taking the school jeep on a midnight joy ride over very dangerous logging trails which nearly got him expelled , not to mention killed  --  and I hope you know how much I 'd save having you at a public school here in the city  --  but no , the mother pesters and pleads till the headmaster gives him one last chance , all because she has this pipe dream he 'll end up with an A-minus average , write a brilliant essay and be chosen as the school 's first exchange student ever is that what you mean by a pipe dream ? MARTIN Why did you leave me up there ? How come you did n't just bring me home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you trying to say , angel mine ? MARTIN I 'm not trying to say anything . I asked a question , you obviously do n't want to answer , and that 's the end of that . p. 10 ELISE Mais quelle force ! Quelle finalit . Je suis desol. ? ( Smiles ) Did you understand ? MARTIN Why should I ? ELISE Darling , you 're not off to Switzerland as a tourist , you represent a school , an entire nation , you must be fluent in the language . MARTIN That was French , Mom . The Swiss speak German . ELISE ( snaps ) Do n't lecture me about the Swiss . I knew a dwarf from Zurich once . He spoke French . To me , anyway . MARTIN Why do you say these stupid things when you do n't know what you 're talking about ! ELISE ( grandly ) Switzerland is a mountainous country full of very clean people who stayed neuter in the war . They eat lots of chocolate and always know what time it is . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARTIN Neutral , Mom . They were neutral in the war . ELISE That 's what I said . MARTIN You said neuter . ELISE A pedant , no less . ( MARTIN starts out ) Where do you think you 're going ? p. 11 MARTIN I have to get ready . ELISE Darling , I only have you for one short week . Let 's both try hard to make the most of our time together . Sit . ( MARTIN obeys . ELISE joins him and mimes that his head is a box with a lid she can unlock and open . An old game . ) Now then ; Turn the key/Open the lid/Look where all the secrets are hid ! MARTIN ( brushing her hand aside ) Do n't . ELISE Do you want me to say I 'm sorry ? Is that really necessary ? You know I wanted to be at Parent 's Day . Imagine how I felt missing my son 's finest hour , but we were weeks behind on the autumn line and they asked us to volunteer for overtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you is truly dedicated to Maison de Maurice Continental Fashions . If I 'd taken time off you know how hard I 've worked all year for promotion MARTIN Are we ever going to see Andrew ? ELISE Ah . So that 's what this is all about . MARTIN We 've been back in the city for almost a year . ELISE Should n't you be getting ready for your friends ? MARTIN You always do this . p. 12 ELISE Do what ? MARTIN I bring up his name and , bang , you change the subject . ELISE There 's nothing to say . He 's not interested in us , finis . MARTIN How do you know ? ELISE After ten years out west we return to his city and nothing , not a peep ( Stops herself ) No , I swore I would never do this . I will not poison the well . I 'm sure he has his reasons . MARTIN Was he the one who left ? ELISE There was a war MARTIN I mean after . ELISE Oh , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? People change . He went away , he came back different . MARTIN Why ? What was he like before the war ? ELISE ( beat ) Before the war was a whole other world . Into the sunset , red flags waving , artists and workers of the world united . MARTIN ( trying to get it straight ) And I was after that ? ELISE You were never not there , my angel , my blessing . p. 13 MARTIN Mom , I 'm serious . ELISE Darling , I 've had a long day . Tomorrow . We 'll have a nice talk tomorrow , all right ? MARTIN What if he did want to see us ? ELISE What if the moon was green cheese . He could have seen you on his own at Parent 's Day if it 's me he 's afraid of . MARTIN He did n't know you would n't be there . ELISE That 's hardly the point what do you mean " he did n't know . " MARTIN How could he , we have n't been in touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ELISE Martin , look at me , I heard you . MARTIN You heard wrong . ELISE ( agitated ) Have you been in touch with him , has he called you at school , was he at Parent 's Day ? MARTIN Of course not . How could you even think something like that ? ELISE I 'm sorry , darling . You 'd have told me , would n't you . MARTIN Cross my heart and hope to die , okay ? p. 14 ELISE No secrets . Not between the two of us . MARTIN It 's only ' cause you said we 'd all be together when we got back east ELISE Never MARTIN You did , Mom , when we left New Mexico , that first night in the motel ELISE I said no such thing . ( Tired of this , MARTIN goes off to wash . ELISE is puzzled by his behavior . As she explains herself , we can see an edginess in her manner . First , she glances around to make sure he is gone then , talking , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourbon into her milk , sips and replaces flask in bag . ) I may have touched on the possibility of an evening together  --  something along those lines . I do n't consider it extravagant of me to assume , after ten years , he might be just the least bit curious about us . ( Quieter ) Who 'd have thought he 'd still be so terrified of contact . MARTIN ( breezes in combing hair ) Can I use your toothbrush ? I left mine at school . ELISE What a handsome young man . You 'll break some poor woman 's heart one day . Not that one ! ( MARTIN has lifted the wrong glass of milk . Pause . He brings it to his nose and smells , then sets it down. ) p. 15 ELISE It 's been a funny old year , darling . You see , I finally understand something , and it has n't been easy . No one is going to help us . ( Brighter ) But when you return from Europe , we 'll have our very own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn electricity till the wires hum hallelujah ! MARTIN Mom . ELISE ( distant ) I thought I could leave this damn city behind . MARTIN Mom . ELISE What is it , angel ? MARTIN I think the house is a great idea . ELISE ( beams ) In that case , I 'm sure some people in Switzerland speak German . Prosit ! ( Raises glass ) Now then , a warm bath , then slide between the sheets with a nice , fat Russian novel while my little genius slips into the night , with his mysterious friends from school . Undo me . ( MARTIN hesitates , then unfastens his mother 's dress down the back . ) ELISE ( sings ) I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last nightalive as you or mesays I , But Joe , you 're ten years dead p. 16 MARTIN ( joins ) I never died , says heI never died , says he ELSEWHERE ( ANDREW 'S PLACE ) ( ANDREW appears in a pool of light , watching something as he speaks . ) ANDREW ( like control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read me ELISE ( to MARTIN ) Thank you , angel ANDREW Zurich , Switzerland to ST-107 , come in ELISE ( hugging MARTIN ) It 's so nice to have company ! ( ELISE exits . Alone at last , MARTIN breathes deeply , as if relieved of a great weight . His arms go out like an airplane and , as lights dim on ELISE 's place , he begins to fly across the stage in a shaft of light . ) MARTIN ( in flight ) ST-107 to Zurich Control , ST-107 to Zurich Control ANDREW You have clearance to land , Runway two is your active , exit Green-C , that 's " C " for Charlie , do you read ? MARTIN ( in flight ) Active runway is two , exit Green-C , over and out ( Lights up on ANDREW 's place , where MARTIN sits on packing box , ANDREW issuing commands . The room is bare , boxes around , a place being moved into . Among things being unpacked are books , a high-quality telescope , antique-model square rigger sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegance . ANDREW is an imposing man , forceful , energetic , used to giving orders and being listened to , but also capable of puzzling sudden delicacy of expression and manner , an almost pedantic fussiness. ) p. 17 ANDREW Good , now what ?

ANDREW Well , I had a hat on my head and a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit picker , sign painter , even deputy sheriff up in Idaho , you name it . MARTIN Mom never said . ANDREW Listen , kiddo . I quit school . I quit ' cause nothing made sense , what I saw going on around me  --  newspapers screaming prosperity , growth , record employment , while my dad and damn near everyone we knew could barely put meat on the table once a week , and still they believed the headlines . So , one day , bang , out the door , age fifteen , rode the rails west to see for myself , and you know what ? After five years of knocking around , I knew the truth . The papers were lying . That 's right . This country was a total Goddamn disaster . And they kept right on lying all the way to ' 29 , when things got so bad they just could n't anymore . You hold onto that ( the photo ) and remember  --  do n't believe what they tell you . Go out and see for yourself . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't we just talking ? ANDREW I never " just talk .

Take our very initials , U.S. and U.S.S.R. , both begin with us , and does this not suggest a greater unity " ANDREW Good , you 're blushing MARTIN I am not . ANDREW It 's bullshit , and you know it . You 're just parroting back what you know they want to hear up at that circus of a school , " International Brotherhood of Man " Christ alive MARTIN Take it easy , that 's just the motto ANDREW It 's a wet dream for radical has-beens . They hire a staff of academic rejects from around the world  --  at half price  --  and call it a Global Environment . How could she get suckered in , after everything we fought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the place , why do n't you call Mom and we 'll all get together and talk it over . ANDREW ( beat ) Knowledge is everything , Marty . Everything . I do n't want to see you open your mouth ever again to please another man . You say only what you truly believe , or you shut up . p. 23 MARTIN Dad , what if say I had n't written that essay . ANDREW Did you ? MARTIN Sort of . Not really . I cribbed it from this U.N . journal in the school library . I did n't mean for it to get all out of hand like this . ( Beat ) Dad ? ANDREW All right . Put it out of your head . I do n't think you 're that kind of kid . Are you ? MARTIN I thought they 'd catch me . I thought I 'd be sent home . Someone has to be with her . ANDREW Who ? Wait a minute . You tried to get yourself booted on her account ? MARTIN ( agitated ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean it , not this time , or maybe it 's just different now ' cause it was always , before , when we moved someplace she 'd make it a big adventure and it was all going to be fine , but nothing 's working out the way she planned and I do n't know how to make it better  --  she does n't eat right , she gives her money away , she forgets to pay her bills and now I 'll be gone all year ANDREW Stop right there . That woman is tough as old leather , and always has been . She does n't want help . People have tried , believe me . You carry your own load , Martin . She 'll be fine . Do you understand me ? p. 24 MARTIN Yes , sir . ANDREW Now let 's have that Moxie . PENNY ( reenters , still in robe ) Okay , last time , I promise . Toothbrush ?

Nice , but intense . Andrew and I are having a very fun time together , yes . MARTIN That 's not what I asked . PENNY And this is n't exactly the conversation I imagined having with my boyfriend 's son . MARTIN Boy ? He 's old enough to be your father . PENNY Are we getting along or not ?

EMMA Is n't it exciting , a whole year in Switzerland ! All that culture  --  and snow ! ELISE And what has the mystery man been up to ? MARTIN Nothing . ELISE Now does n't that conjure a vivid picture , yes , I see it all MARTIN I have to change . By the way , Mom , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MARTIN Nothing , I was just wondering  --  have you made any actual plan-plans ? ELISE Every minute of the evening is accounted for , why ? MARTIN Nothing . ( Starts off ) ELISE " Nothing . " Must be the new word of the fifties . And while we 're at it , kindly remove your dirty laundry from the floor in there . I am not here to peel grapes for the Sultan of Bumbum .

ELISE The day is far too hot for ice , Lew . Just pour and carry . ( LEW exits ) Does Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't help myself . The way he said " Hi , Emma " ELISE He 's certainly developing Andrew 's manner . Imperious , full of disapproving looks . He blames me that his father has n't been in touch , but what more can I do , I told him we were coming east EMMA You spoke to Andrew ? ELISE Post card , hello-goodbye . Emma , I need a favor , a very big one . EMMA How big is very ? ELISE I bought some land . An entire acre . p. 34 EMMA When ? Where ? ELISE Upstate , by a river somewhere . EMMA You have n't seen it ? ELISE An inside deal , there was n't time . I need a mortgage by the weekend , or the whole thing goes on public auction . EMMA How much ? ELISE It wo n't be touched . Straight into my savings account , and when the upstate bank sees my collateral , I get the mortgage , and you get back every penny . EMMA You know I ca n't refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sure you know what you 're doing . ELISE Would you think me crazy if I told you that for the first time in years I feel lucky . Look how well Martin is doing  --  I 'm reestablished in the city  --  I even started a new poem . And guess what ? I did n't get the promotion . EMMA How can that be , they promised ! ELISE Office intrigue , tushes unkissed . And not a word to Martin  --  nothing darkens this week of ours . EMMA All that overtime , the weekends , are n't you crushed ? ELISE Not a bit , that 's the whole point . I know what I really want now , and the rest is just weather , a few clouds , a light sprinkle , who cares . I 've had my revenge , we 're wearing it . p. 35 EMMA Bring it to the union . File a complaint ELISE Sunday night I 'm taking Martin to dinner , then " My Fair Lady "  --  yes , a special show for the union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi to the Hawaiian Room where I 've ordered champagne waiting , and as we raise our glasses to toast , I shall hand Martin the deed to an entire acre of land by a river in both our names  --  oh , Emma , I ca n't wait to see his face !

LEW ( extends glasses ) Down the hatch . EMMA That 's enough for ten people , Lew . We have n't even eaten yet . ( LEW gulps down most of one glassful and reextends glass to EMMA . ) LEW Try that . ELISE Who said chivalry was dead . ( Takes other glass ) LEW This Greenwich Village is quite a proposition . How 's about that place on the corner with the black toilet in the window . Kinda off-beat touch for a restaurant . ELISE Lew , may I ask you a direct question ? LEW It 's a free country . ELISE Who on earth are you , and why did you follow Emma here ? LEW That 's pretty direct . EMMA I do n't normally attach myself to strange men in the street . LEW Am I that strange ? ELISE To be found drifting in our bohemian latitudes , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more regular sort of wife  --  life , I mean , life . p. 37 LEW If I 'm a third wheel here , just say the word and I 'll roll on down the road . EMMA Were you part of the demonstration or not ? LEW I was following my nose , sight-seeing is all . Heard women yelling out the windows , I look up and see bars , hell , could n't believe it . Where I come from you do n't put a woman 's prison smack dab in the middle of town . Then I see Emma and them down below with banners  --  I figure in the way of local color it 's got the Circle Line beat all to hell . ELISE ( amused ) We seem to have a slight misunderstanding . LEW No , ma 'm , I understand when it feels real nice talking with someone . EMMA Lew was a frogman is n't that what you said ? LEW ( shows tattoo on arm ) Korea . ELISE And how many tadpoles did you leave behind , Lew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Smiles ) Like if I had some kids out of wedlock . Pretty sneaky how you put that , sneaks up on you . ELISE Have n't you a glass ? LEW In there ? ( Points to kitchen ) Refill anyone ? p. 38 ELISE Oh , bend my arm . ( Extends her glass grandly ) EMMA I 'm fine , thank you . LEW If you do n't mind my saying so , you 're a helluva lot better than fine , Emma . ( Exits to kitchen ) EMMA ( blushing at ELISE 's amusement ) Oh , God , how could I bring him here , what was I thinking ? ELISE He 's sweet , he 's good looking and he likes you . Perhaps my luck is rubbing off on a friend . EMMA No , no , it 's too bizarre , what could he possibly want with a woman like me ? ELISE Three guesses . EMMA Stop . Men never walk up to me like that  --  with a big smile , unless ( realizes ) Oh my God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how they penetrate , find a demonstration ELISE What on earth are you talking about ? EMMA The F.B.I . ELISE Emma ! EMMA Sure , sure , you think it all ended with Senator McCarthy , but you 're wrong . Cedric 's been getting mysterious phone calls upstairs . They listen and hang up . He 's sure they 're watching our building , and everyone knows I take his mail when he travels p. 39 ELISE And they all know he was in our commune twenty years ago , oh yes , Cedric among the rustic revolutionaries , poison ivy from head to foot , Das Kapital in hand , sowing corn for the masses . Popping corn . I assure you , the F.B.I . did not tremble at our labors . EMMA It 's been so long since I was with a man  --  that way . ELISE Like riding a bicycle . Once you mount , the rest comes rushing back . EMMA You 're terrible . MARTIN ( enters ) Anyone for the bathroom ? I 'm going to take a shower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of plan , your mother is free as a bird tonight EMMA You ca n't leave me alone with that man ! ELISE Shush .

It was supposed to be a surprise . ELISE I 'm sorry , dear , Sunday is out of the question . MARTIN Come on , Mom , it 'll be great , they said I could bring someone . You always talk about meeting my friends , well , now 's your chance . ELISE Martin , there will be no discussion about this . We made a date , it 's final . MARTIN How about if we just dropped in for a little while . ELISE I said no . If it 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARTIN How can they just change everything at the last minute ? ELISE Oh , they ca n't but I can . EMMA Excuse me , I 'll just help Lew in the kitchen ( she does n't move ) MARTIN The party 's for me , Mom . You 're not going to let me go to my own party ? ELISE Honestly , you are the limit . You come breezing in and expect me to rearrange my life at your every whim . MARTIN No , Mom , if I said I was going to Parent 's Day , I 'd go . p. 41 ELISE That was unworthy of you . EMMA Please excuse me ( she stays put ) MARTIN Forget it , all right , let 's just forget the whole thing ( starts out ) ELISE You turn around and march yourself right back in here , young man MARTIN It 's my party , and I 'm going , with or without you . ELISE You do demand your pound of flesh . MARTIN ( relenting ) All I meant they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were busy , I understand , but you 're free Sunday night , and I 'd just be really proud if I could introduce you . ELISE ( beat ) Mister Tongue of Velvet . But afterwards , I demand a private hour alone with his majesty . MARTIN You 'll get all dressed up , okay ? Like you do sometimes ? ELISE I shall not disappoint . LEW ( enters with empty bottle ) We got us a dead soldier here . I 'll spring for a live one if you like . EMMA We 've had more than enough , Lew. p. 42 MARTIN Sorry I yelled . And thanks . Have a good old time everyone . ( Moves to go ) LEW ( to MARTIN ) I see you 're looking at the critter .

LEW How ' bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here says you ca n't guess what it is . MARTIN A frog . LEW ( beat ) I 'll be darned . Smart hombre . MARTIN The web feet sort of give it away . LEW ( removing watch ) Whole outfit got ' em . Inchon Harbor , little Chinee fellow , two different color eyes . ( Holds out his watch ) There ya go . ELISE Lew , that 's hardly appropriate . LEW A bet 's a bet . Won it in a poker game to start with , easy come , easy go . p. 43 EMMA ( agitated ) Lew , would you please put that back on and stop behaving this way . MARTIN Should I stick around , Mom ? ELISE Take your shower . ( MARTIN exits . Pause . ) LEW He 's your son ? I thought it was more one of those brother-sister type things , you hardly look old enough ELISE Lewis , are you in some kind of trouble ? LEW ( awkward ) I 'll just pop on downstairs for another bottle . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 've been shut off . ( Beat ) I did n't realize there was families involved here .

I 've made an informal study of men in his condition . EMMA So much for my luck . Shall we eat ? I 'm famished . ELISE Emma , I love you dearly . We 'll always be together , wo n't we  --  eat , dance , grow old together , two leftover lefties in tennis shoes and sweat socks p. 44 EMMA I think I 'll wear a cape  --  a black one ! ELISE Yes , and we 'll carry umbrellas , and if anyone is rude to us , we 'll whack them on the ankles MARTIN ( off ) Last call for the bathroom ELISE I want the money . I 'm asking you for it here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That his strength comes from me . ( EMMA removes a checkbook from her handbag , signs and tears out a check , then holds open the ledger page for ELISE . ) EMMA That 's my balance . Make it out for whatever you need . ELISE What do you really think , Emma ? EMMA I think you have an extraordinary heart . I think you love better than you know . ELISE Dear Emma . Be close to me always always . ( LEW stands in the doorway , sheepish . Both see him at the same time . ) LEW I feel like a damn heel , slinking off like that . May I come in for a minute ? ELISE I think Lew has something to tell us . EMMA Stop doing this , first you 're inside , then you 're outside , then you 're back inside p. 45 LEW I know , I know EMMA Stay put , just stay in one place until we 're used to it ( gulps down drink ) LEW My fault , I did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know what the hell I 'm doing any more . See , it looks a little like I might be leaving my wife . ( ELISE and EMMA exchange a look ) Came here for the expo , but that closed a few days back and I 'm still here , floating around . We been gearing up to start on our own , me and my partner back home , Luigi , which happens to be Lew in Eye-talian . My card .

ELISE ( takes card and reads out ) " Contracting , renovation , modernizing , no job too big . " ( Beat ) You 're a builder , Lew ? LEW That 's the plan . Bank 's in . Made a ton of contacts at the Housing Show . Everyone seems to think we 'll do real good . Only problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can you tell people when they 're rooting for you all the way p. 46 ELISE ( passes her drink to LEW ) Go on , Lewis , the natives are friendly . LEW ( beat ) I been sleeping out in Central Park . Kind of an impulse-type thing . But I tell you , I have n't felt so damn happy since Korea . Like I was thinking , here I am , lying on my back in the middle of this great city on what 's got ta be the most valuable piece of real estate going , but no one builds there . It 's free for everyone to enjoy . Now does n't that say something about people at their best . ( Shy ) I say that kinda stuff back home and they look at me like I got a lump on my head the size of a grapefruit . Anyhow , that 's my story . ( Drains glass ) Thanks for hearing me out .

You can hear ' em in the bushes . p. 48 MARTIN ( removes food from bag ) Cheese and bread , is that okay ? PENNY It was sweet of you to suggest this . After the other night , I was n't sure where we stood . MARTIN I did n't expect someone so young . And pretty . PENNY If that 's a compliment , I accept . ( She watches as MARTIN removes wine and a blanket . ) Wine ! Are n't we French ! But red ? I believe for picnics in the park with your father 's girlfriend , the wine of choice is white . MARTIN ( puzzled ) There 's no such thing . PENNY I 'm joshing . I see we have the serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open it . PENNY You want to know a secret ?

In the night table . I spend the night sometimes . Does that shock you ? MARTIN I figured it went beyond Chinese food . p. 49 PENNY Touch . MARTIN How come you 're telling me this ? PENNY An olive branch . You offer bread and wine , I offer a peek behind the Throne of Glory . ( Pause . MARTIN notices PENNY watching him . ) MARTIN What are you looking at ? PENNY ( beat ) You know  --  sometimes at the zoo , and no one 's figured out why  --  this very peculiar thing happens .

And then , just as suddenly , they go absolutely quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as if they 'd been in the grip of some wild , over-whelming passion , and now they 're embarrassed by their own feelings . ( Beat ) People are animals . ( Beat ) Do you know what I 'm saying ? MARTIN ( looks away ) Wine ? PENNY So what 's this all about ? MARTIN All what ? PENNY Some people just ca n't fake it with each other . It 's cards on the table , or nothing . MARTIN It 's about the party . I have a problem . p. 50 PENNY That 's better . See how easy it is ? MARTIN I 'm bringing someone . PENNY And ? MARTIN And see , at school there 's a lot of kids from the city . Which means stories get back sometimes , you know , like about our parents and everything . And that 's real bad news , ' cause it 's supposed to be you keep your home life kind of quiet . PENNY How come ? MARTIN Oh , the old story , all of us sent away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old story . MARTIN Please do n't take this the wrong way PENNY I 'm listening . MARTIN See , if word got back that my father dated real young girls they can really make your life hell with gossip like that . PENNY You mean stop dating Andrew because it embarrasses you ? MARTIN Do n't be silly . It 's just my date she 's from school , really nice girl , but she 's got a big mouth and if she saw you with Andrew PENNY What are you getting at ? p. 51 MARTIN Like if you could n't make it Sunday night ? There 's a flu bug going around . PENNY ( laughs ) This is the first time I 've ever been hustled by an adolescent . MARTIN It 's no joke , Penny . One kid had a nervous breakdown when it got back his mom was a hooker PENNY I know my overalls stink , but I can still smell bullshit when a truckload of it falls on my head .

EMMA You came to see Lew . ELISE Lew ? He 's here ? EMMA Do n't . He told me you 've met him at the Copper Pot for drinks . Twice . ELISE Advice about the house . Oh , Emma , you do n't think I 'd do anything so underhand . EMMA You do n't mean to , I know . ELISE It 's you I had to see . Please believe me , you 're the only one who makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage . And I let you , it 's my fault  --  you just do n't understand your power . ELISE Power ? What power have I ever had over anything ? EMMA Over Martin . Me . Your friends even Lew . He talks about nothing else , day and night ; what 's she like , when did you meet her , has she mentioned me ELISE He 's such a baby EMMA And you are wonderfully blind , Elise . It 's your great strength . My God , the hours I have spent talking politics to some poor fool while he glances over my head at guess-who across the room , surrounded by admirers . You never knew , you took it for granted . After all , who am I ? The Friend . The **27;3400;TOOLONG p. 65 ELISE I was n't even there when you met Lew . You brought him to my place . EMMA Who cares about that stupid man , take him , get him away from me , he talks nonsense , I ca n't stand having him underfoot all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't it ? EMMA All we did was talk . I 'd go up . He 'd come down . It was enough . They 'll never let him back . ELISE ( approaches EMMA ) I 'll stay EMMA Do n't touch me . I 'm fragile but coping . ELISE ( beat ) Cedric never proposed . EMMA I know . ELISE Why do I say these things ? EMMA He slept with you once . You struck him as shallow . ELISE ( surprise ) Well , he 's wrong . And a terrible lover . You missed nothing . EMMA Thank you for telling me . ELISE ( offers flask ) First aid ? EMMA ( tetchy ) Ca n't you wait for a glass ! ( Pause . They laugh . EMMA exits to the kitchen . Alone , ELISE is suddenly agitated again , checking her face in compact mirror . LEW , having appeared quietly , watches her for a moment. ) p. 66 LEW Like what you see ? ELISE Lewis ! Good evening . LEW I thought you were spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma had a little upset . I thought I should drop by . LEW What about later ? ELISE Later has n't happened yet . LEW Is that a yes or a no ? ( EMMA reenters with mug and wineglass . LEW covers ) I was just on my way out . Emma 's been kind enough to let me use her couch EMMA I think she already knows that , Lew . LEW Do n't suppose either of you good ladies would care to join me ? EMMA I 'm afraid you ca n't stay here after tomorrow . LEW Getting too comfortable , huh ? Time to face the music . EMMA I 'm glad you understand . LEW I 'll just head on down to the Copper Pot for a bite , maybe stick around till closing . ( Beat ) Careful who you talk to about that house idea , Elise . I made some calls . It smells big . Real big . I 'll run it down for you any time . ( Beat ) Say , what 's the deal with the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 67 EMMA We would n't know , Lew . LEW ( gets the message . Starting out , he hesitates ) Good night . ( Exits ) EMMA ( having poured , lifts mug ) And here we are again . To us ? ELISE You see  --  I begged Andrew to take us back . I know that 's why he has n't been in touch . EMMA Ah . The post card . ELISE It was more than a post card , Emma . It was my future , spilling onto paper , scribble , scribble , scribble  --  you know how I get under the influence . New Mexico somewhere . Some hotel , some bar , the drive east . Martin asleep down the hall . Always , till then , I felt my life moving forward to a better time . Then the ground slipped under my feet . Just a little . And I felt completely alone . EMMA Are n't we being a little dramatic ? ELISE No , I saw what I was that night , so clearly  --  begging Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've always been the same , full of wonderful plans , but lacking some vital gear to set me in motion and make me sufficient , without a man . Oh God , Emma , just to stand before him whole , that 's all I want . " There Andrew , I ask nothing , I need nothing , only you . " Then I have to go and ruin the whole thing . ( Beat ) Dear oh dear , listen to her . You 're right , I 'm full of Russian blood tonight , bring on the balalaikas. p. 68 EMMA You know , Andrew called Cedric your first month back . He wanted to know was it true you were staying down here . ELISE ( beat ) You tell me this now ? EMMA Cedric hates meddling . He said two things in this country were inevitable without our help  --  the Revolution , and your reunion with Andrew . ELISE Dear old Cedric.ELSEWHERE ( ANDREW 'S PLACE ) ( Enter ANDREW with a large cake . ) EMMA People do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just be yourself . ELISE ( brighter ) Incandescent ? Ravishing ? Irresistible ? Yes , I see what you mean . And with a young man beside me anyone would die to call their own . ( They hug ) EMMA Next week ? Same time ? Same place ? ( ELISE exits , then EMMA as ) ( Enter PENNY quietly , watching ANDREW place candles carefully in cake . The room is now furnished , but there is still some junk and boxes in corners , plus spare party supplies which define the space as a utility area not to be used by guests . Party noises from next door , and the sound of someone playing the piano very well , perhaps a piece by Jelly Roll Morton. ) p. 69 PENNY You sweet old thing . ( ANDREW turns suddenly ) Do n't worry , no one 's coming in here  --  he 's got ' em all spellbound . ANDREW ( animated ) Can you believe that little son of a gun ? Where 'd he learn to tell stories like that , non-stop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch him with the liquor . ANDREW What the hell , let him make a few mistakes of his own , he 's had enough mothering for one lifetime . PENNY He 's overboard , sweetie . He wants so much to make a good impression . Just let him know he has nothing to prove  --  he 's sixteen , for God 's sake ANDREW And he 's twenty-five , and he 's ten . At his age it 's all fever and hormones . Just watch , the minute his girlfriend shows up everything 'll be fine . PENNY Is that what the big book said ? ANDREW Book ? PENNY The one you 've been underlining all week ? The Psychology of the Adolescent ? ANDREW A spy in my house , eh ? What else did you learn from all those clean-living upright Calvinists back on the farm ? p. 70 PENNY Very funny . ANDREW He 's my son , kitten . I think I know what he 's going through , thank you . Hey , you 've been a great sport about fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENNY Talk about unbelievable ! ANDREW Now what ? PENNY You two seem to think , I do n't know , like you 're this fabulous father-son team , one of those portraits on the boardwalk with a hole in it where every woman in the city 's just dying to stick her head and get her picture taken . ANDREW Is someone getting a little complicated here ? PENNY God forbid , we ca n't have that . ANDREW Penny , stop taking the damn world on your shoulders . Your father is not here drinking himself to death . Martin is not in crisis . Everyone enjoyed meeting you . Do n't look for things to fix when everything 's okay . PENNY ( finger gun ) Pow ! I 'm right . Keep an eye on him . ANDREW Come here you little snoop . You gazelle . You sexy zoo creature , you . ( They kiss warmly . MARTIN bursts in , flushed as ANDREW and PENNY separate fast. ) p. 71 MARTIN Hey , Dad , that bald guy out there with the earring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here MARTIN Is n't he on the television ? ANDREW That 's Mister Clean , now am-scray MARTIN And who 's that Chinese guy that keeps talking in a funny voice ? ANDREW Oh , Jesus , Lee Chen must be doing his Milton Berle imitation . Just tell him " Uncle Milty , how jee-la , " he 'll die a happy man . MARTIN HOW jee-la ? ANDREW Having a good time ? MARTIN Are you kidding ? Wait 'll they hear about this back at school  --  where 's the vodka ? PENNY Where 's your date ? MARTIN ( stops ) Date ? ( Smooth ) She had a few things to take care of . Do n't worry , you 'll meet her . PENNY I was thinking more of the condition she 'll find you in . MARTIN I can hold my liquor , Penny . Thanks for your concern . PENNY Do n't mention it . p. 72 ANDREW ( intervenes ) How ' bout a Moxie ? We 'll split one . MARTIN Sure . ANDREW ( as she goes , to MARTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm starting to think this magazine thing might really take off , and no small thanks to the entertainment committee MARTIN ( spots cake ) Hey , is that an airfield ?

MARTIN I 'll tell you my opinion , Dad . It 's pretty corny . ANDREW ( laughs ) So it is , what the hell . Say , do you know this one ( sings ) Oh Mister GallagherYes , Mister Sheen ?

Who was that lady that I saw you with last night ? **26;3429;TOOLONG ( lost ) ( explains ) See , Gallagher takes her out in a rowboat and they 're spooning away , when this wave comes and sploosh , into the water  --  they swim for their life , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoreNow she 's mine forever moreWho , the lady , Mister Gallagher ? No , the rowboat , Mister Sheen ! ( laughs ) What a team . Father took me unforgettable . He knew every record by heart . ( beat ) Well , I guess we 'll leave the entertaining to you . p. 73 MARTIN That was terrific , Dad . ANDREW Listen , kiddo , I had a thought . How 'd you like a little company on the trip over ? MARTIN You mean Europe ? ANDREW Leave early , take a few weeks , Burma , Chinese border , show you some of the old army haunts , maybe shoot a travel piece , coffee-table stuff , then drop you off in Switzerland . MARTIN Just you and me ? ANDREW Spend some time . Catch up . MARTIN Mom 's never been abroad . ANDREW Us , Marty . Just the two of us . MARTIN You really hate her , do n't you . ANDREW Hey , kiddo , how ' bout we stick to the subject here . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't you even just a little curious to see what she 's like ? ANDREW Your mother is an all-or-nothing kind of person . Clean break , that 's how she wants it , no calls , no letters  --  fine with me MARTIN But if she had been in touch , just say  --  would you want to talk to her ? ANDREW Sometimes things happen in your life that seem very , very important at the time , but in the long run you realize they 're just not the main event . It 's no use living in the past . p. 74 MARTIN Who wants to live there ? I just want someone to talk about it . ANDREW Hey , tell ya what , and this is a promise . We travel together , and I 'll jawbone you till my teeth fall out , okay ? Till then , just remember , there 's two sides to every story , and whatever you may have heard  --  I was always ready to listen to their side of things , even to help out where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . Which is why , just by the way , a certain gentleman who 's called me some pretty colorful names over the years  --  and in print  --  but a damn good man all the same , when he was arrested this morning , it was n't the others he used his one phone call to ask for advice . What we might have done , if we 'd all held together . MARTIN ( abruptly ) Dad , was I a mistake ? ANDREW Okay , Marty , what 's going on here ? MARTIN I want to know . ANDREW Who the hell ever put an idea like that in your head ? MARTIN It 's just there . ANDREW Cut the games . All night I 've been smelling the old routines , the hints , the innuendo , slippy-sliding around , I did n't like it then , I do n't like it now . Something 's on your mind , you look me in the eye and spit it out . p. 75 MARTIN All right , my date is Mom . ANDREW ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you crazy ? MARTIN No , Dad , I am not crazy . ANDREW She put you up to it . It 's okay , you can tell me , I know the way she can back people into a corner . MARTIN It was me . I wanted you to see each other . ANDREW Why ? MARTIN Why do you think ? ANDREW I think you 're picking up some very bad ideas about what 's acceptable behavior . You never pull this kind of stunt on me . That woman is a disruptive , unreliable and very treacherous individual MARTIN Do n't say that . She 's generous . She 's kind . Okay , maybe she 's a little different , but there 's no law against that . She cares , Dad . About everyone . I 've seen her buy a whole meal for a total stranger just ' cause they were out on the street . People love her . Everyone does . You did , once . ( Beat ) Did n't you ? ANDREW This is n't for now . MARTIN Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the world . p. 76 MARTIN Good to know , Dad . ANDREW ( sharp ) Hey . I mean it . No more . MARTIN I 'm sorry . Let 's have a party . ANDREW When they 're gone , maybe  --  we 'll see . Now let 's set fire to this damn airport and haul it outside . MARTIN You bet . ANDREW When she gets here , I want you to answer the door . I 'll go out and talk to her in the hall . MARTIN Do n't worry , Dad , she wo n't show up . It 's Parent 's Day . Another pipe dream.ELSEWHERE ( ELISE 'S PLACE ) ( Enter LEW , hopping like a frog , followed by ELISE , both giddy . ) LEW ( frog noise ) Grrrk-grrrk , turn on the full moon , I ca n't see my darn lily-pad .

There 's danger in candlelight . LEW We 'll see about that , lady . ( LEW scoots over on the couch to make room . ELISE notes this and moves pointedly to the table , where she spreads her plans . ) ELISE It 's only a rough ground plan . I 'm no architect . ( LEW , acknowledging the cut , has risen to join ELISE at the table . ) LEW What 's on the side here , you planning a gymnasium ? ELISE Martin 's room . My son . LEW Half the house . Kind of disproportionate , do n't you think ? ELISE A boy needs room to grow . LEW He can go outdoors every now and then , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . LEW You do n't understand what we got here . Forget about one house , this idea is good for a whole damn development , Futureville , whatever , fifty , maybe a hundred units , but we got ta start with a basic layout that meets the needs of your average American family . ELISE The average American family does not interest me . I want a home for me and my son , finis . p. 79 LEW You 're quite a handful , are n't you . ELISE Do n't change the subject . LEW Elise , I got ta say this , I just do . See , I went A.W.O.L. in Korea  --  lived on a houseboat , Chinese family took me in , aunts , cousins , grandkids . I never did sort ' em all out . But they had something I never saw before , and being with them I came home a stranger , ' cause I knew how little you need to be truly happy . Feeling close to someone is all . Peaceful close .

LEW You 're a million miles away . p. 80 ELISE Less than half a city , but never mind . LEW I 'm very smitten with you . ELISE ( suddenly delighted ) Smitten ? Now there 's a word worth bringing back , oh yes ! LEW I guess I strike you as kind of basic . ELISE ( gently ) Go home , Lew . Stand in front of everything you love  --  children , wife , the what is it , Sunshine Sky over Witchita ? Imagine losing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can know that ? It may be desolation , regret , and a terrible aching loneliness . Do I frighten you , I hope so . Because until you can feel the loss , but still know a yearning greater than all you 're letting go , you must never dare speak the magic word . LEW Being what ? ELISE ( pause ) Good-bye . LEW ( resolute ) Where 's your phone , I 'll call her right now . ( MARTIN lifts the phone receiver to dial . ) ELISE Face to face , or not at all . LEW Shoot , Elise , why all this rigamarole , you can see as well as I can what 's going on here . Will you marry me ? ( MARTIN replaces receiver. ) p. 81 ELISE Close your eyes . LEW How come ? ELISE To please your bride-to-be . LEW All right , I 'll play . ( Closes eyes ) ELISE Tell me the color of my eyes . LEW Brown . Sort of hazel-to-brown . ELISE Gray-blue . And my wraparound ? LEW That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have been right one night last week when it was , but tonight , alas , the accent is on rose . Pink I 'd accept , but green ? No , Lewis , a clear strike two . LEW This is silly . ELISE Have n't you noticed , I 'm a silly woman , and I 'll be your silly wife if you get this one right , which should be easy , after the intense scrutiny you 've given it all evening . Am I or am I not wearing a brassiere ? LEW Was I that obvious ? ELISE It was sunshine to a flower . Well ? LEW No brassiere . ELISE Dear man . If only the laws of gravity were so kind . Strike three . You seem to have a different woman in mind . I 'm jealous . ( LEW kisses ELISE suddenly .

ELISE You 're hardly in a position to be judging my life . LEW Take it easy . You deserve better is all . I 'd like to give you what I think you 're worth . ELISE All the right words from all the wrong men . LEW Look at me . ELISE You 'll have to leave now . This was a mistake . Please forgive me , I 'm expected elsewhere .

ELISE But this is me , unadorned . Why do I feel so horribly sober . ( Exits ) ( As LEW collects himself and exits slowly , nonplussed , PENNY enters to MARTIN . ) PENNY So there you are . MARTIN Is it over ? PENNY Some crowd , huh ? A little on the ritzy side for us in the business of hippo turds . How ' bout a smile , I could use it MARTIN I 'm leaving now . PENNY Hey , I know what it 's like being stood up . There 's other girls , summer hotel , cute guy like you . MARTIN Through the service door . I 'll catch an early train in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PENNY Are you drunk ? p. 84 MARTIN No , Penny . My mother is drunk . She 's at a bar somewhere . Or maybe at home . Maybe with a man , who knows ? I started to call her , but what 's the point , she 'd just make up some story to protect me . And I 'd pretend to believe it to protect her . It 's a little game we play called " No Secrets . " You were n't supposed to be here tonight . And she was . PENNY ( beat ) I see . MARTIN Do you ? I was beginning to think no one saw anything , ever . Except Andrew . Because he never lets the little stuff get in the way . You look at what 's in front of you and you call it by its name . I want to sleep with you . PENNY ( beat ) Sure . Can you wait 'll I get my purse ? MARTIN You think I 'm joking ? PENNY Martin , what 's going on ? MARTIN We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , let 's get this exactly right  --  we 've been flirting right from the start . Animals going wild . Stiff bristle ? PENNY I was not flirting with you . MARTIN Will you come with me , yes or no ? PENNY Of course not , are you crazy ? p. 85 MARTIN Very good . A clear , simple answer  --  no evasions , no mysteries . Thank you , Penny . Good night . PENNY Would you please stop being like this . MARTIN What , honest ? PENNY Creepy . Just shut up and sit down for a minute . MARTIN You knew I was back here . You followed me . Why ? To see how I was doing , okay , that 's the excuse , that 's the game , but the reason , Penny ? The real reason . You see what I mean . PENNY You do n't have to impress me , Martin . MARTIN I 'm sick of the bullshit . I 'm sick of pretending I do n't see what 's going on . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so difficult , you 've been flirting with me , say it , say it ! PENNY No , Martin . ( Beat ) Yes . A little . Maybe . Look , I 've noticed the glances . All right , I 've enjoyed them . The smiles . Yes , the danger even  --  wondering if Andrew noticed . I 've never been coveted by two generations of the same family . MARTIN You see ? Underneath , everything 's so simple . You want me . I want you . Sniff sniff . PENNY Would you cut it out , your father 's right outside ! p. 86 MARTIN ( loud , towards door ) I know where my father is ! This has nothing to do with him . PENNY You are a naughty little boy . MARTIN And you are so damn beautiful . PENNY What an operator . I 'm starting to see your technique , Mister Martin . A little mystery , a shock attack , I drop my guard and zip , in for the kill . MARTIN ( puts hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hand away . MARTIN Tonight is for us . PENNY The hand . MARTIN Are you afraid of my father ? PENNY ( removes hand ) That 's enough . I wo n't breathe a word about this , but you have to behave now talk about outrageous . MARTIN ( suddenly defenseless ) Hold me . Please . I wo n't try anything . I need someone close to me . PENNY Oh , Martin , Martin , Martin , what are we going to do with you ? ( PENNY holds him comfortingly . Unseen by PENNY , ANDREW enters from party . MARTIN sees him and responds by taking PENNY 's hand , kissing it , then brushes his lips up her arm as she starts to yield. ) p. 87 ANDREW Penny , go inside . PENNY ( breaking away suddenly ) Poops . Thank God . You better find out what 's going on here . I think your son 's in big trouble . ANDREW ( controlled fury ) Inside . Now . ( As PENNYexits ) All right , Martin , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . MARTIN Want to split a Moxie ? Or should we just look each other in the eye and spit it out . ANDREW What are you trying to prove ? MARTIN I do n't know . And I do n't even care . ANDREW ( beat ) Her . This is all her . MARTIN It 's me , Dad , I 'm back . I 'm back . ( Pause . Enter PENNY , hesitant , looking nervously over her shoulder . ) PENNY Andrew , someone just arrived , she asked for you , I do n't know what to tell her ( ELISE enters in her wraparound . All look at her . ) ELISE Hello , everyone . Sorry I 'm late . ANDREW Elise ! MARTIN Mom , what are you doing here ? p. 88 ELISE I believe I was invited . MARTIN But like that . You came here like that ? ANDREW I 'll handle this . Martin , Penny , wait outside . ELISE No need , Andrew , I come in peace . ANDREW I can imagine . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope you 're not too disappointed . ELISE I 'll get over it . And who might this be ? PENNY My name is Penny . ELISE Penny ! You did n't used to settle for such small change . MARTIN Mom ELISE What , dear ? MARTIN Just behave , okay ? ELISE ( sweetly smiling ) She 's very attractive , and I admire her shoes . Hello , Penny , I 'm the former Mrs. Andrew , and this is our son . Oh , that 's right , you 've met . Welcome to our  --  what shall we call it ?  --  reunion . PENNY Excuse me . ( Exits ) ELISE Not much fight in that one . ANDREW You 've made your grand entrance , you 've stirred up trouble , now what ? p. 89 ELISE Nothing . I 've exhausted my repertoire . ANDREW That 'll be the day . MARTIN Do n't argue , please . ELISE Friendly banter , darling . No , no , when Andrew and I go for blood  --  what did they used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticlimax . Your father was not amused . About himself he has , how much humor would you say , Andrew , on a scale of one to zero ? ANDREW You have n't changed . ELISE Why thank you , you 've held up pretty well yourself . ANDREW That 's not what I meant oh . ELISE Am I going too fast ? You could keep up , once . ( Both ANDREW and ELISE are trying desperately to master their feelings , but both are shaken by the sight of each other , and by the sudden total return of old emotional habits they had perhaps allowed themselves to believe long dead . ) ANDREW Still showing off ? For who , Elise ? Those days are gone , there 's no one left to impress . ELISE Was it for them ? Is that what we 've decided ? ( Beat ) Oh , Andrew , let 's bury the hatchet . Has n't our little war of silence outlived whatever use it never served ? p. 90 ANDREW I 'll say good-bye to my guests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . Is that agreeable ? ELISE The imperious command followed by the rhetorical question  --  vintage Andrew ! ANDREW Fine . You tell me what you 'd like to do . ELISE It 's a profoundly sane and rational plan . ANDREW May we consider it settled ? MARTIN She 's just teasing . It does n't mean anything . ELISE Thank you , dear . ANDREW I know what she 's doing , I know exactly . ELISE Yes , you always know , do n't you . Tell us how to make the perfect martini , and the correct way to say Caribbean , or is it Caribbean  --  and how to address the factory workers so they 'll feel unity with us their creative comrades ANDREW Are you trying to provoke me ? ELISE Oh , phooey , Andrew , ca n't you take a little good-natured ribbing . MARTIN She just says stuff , Dad , ignore it . Talk to her . ELISE Wisdom from babes . Talk to me. p. 91 ANDREW ( measured ) We should come to some formal arrangement about Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contribute . ELISE To take charge , you mean . To send him where he 'll learn dates and names and how to play the game . You certainly have changed sides . ANDREW Same old moves  --  one foot on politics , the other on sentiment , and shift weight to keep us all off balance . ELISE Damn it , Andrew , you 're the one that provokes , you and your Olympian calm . It 's an act , look , look at your fists all clenched up in your pocket . Take them out , show Martin the beast . God knows he 's seen my faults . ANDREW ( tense ) This will not work , Elise . ELISE So it still hurts . Good . After all these years of silence , I was n't sure . ANDREW Your silence , not mine . I kept in touch , only Martin wrote back . ELISE I wrote . I 'm still waiting for an answer . ANDREW Do n't do this , please . Always it starts with a small lie and ends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter ? Andrew , is this cruelty , or extreme tact ? ( Pause . Both ANDREW and ELISE are genuinely puzzled. ) p. 92 MARTIN ( blurts ) Should n't we say good-bye to the guests ? Was n't that the plan ? Then we wo n't be disturbed , okay ? I 'll do it , I 'll take care of everything ELISE Let Andrew . A break might jog his memory . MARTIN Mom , would you get off the letter , forget about it , just talk , have a drink I 'll be back in a minute . ELISE What 's going on ? MARTIN ( starting out ) Nothing . ELISE Martin , look at me . MARTIN ( trying to shrug it off ) It got lost in the mail , you put the wrong address , who cares about a stupid letter , you 're together now , that 's what you wanted , that 's what you wrote ( stops suddenly , caught ) ELISE I see . And did you simply snoop , or did you snoop and destroy . ANDREW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELISE ) You do n't want him to see it . ELISE Did you keep my letter ? Martin , answer me . MARTIN ( confused ) You never show up . We make all these plans . I did n't know if you 'd be here tonight p. 93 ELISE In which case , what ? You 'd show your father the damning evidence and I 'd stand exposed ? MARTIN But I did n't . You 're here . ELISE This was n't worthy of you , Martin . ( MARTIN , in frustration , takes the letter from his jacket pocket and throws it on the floor . ) ANDREW Put that away . ELISE No . What 's done is done . Martin ? MARTIN ( urgent ) Mom you do n't remember what you wrote , you do n't remember anything from that night . ELISE ( steely ) My forgiveness has limits . ( MARTIN picks up and hands her the letter . She extends it to ANDREW ) For you . ANDREW Are you sure ? ELISE Thank you . Yes . ANDREW ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all this ? ELISE Cocktail napkins . The Campfire Lounge , if memory serves . Not my finest hour . MARTIN It was just that one night . She hardly ever drinks . Mom , take it back , please p. 94 ELISE ( to ANDREW ) Shall I tell you what it says ? I missed you . Not a day went by I did n't regret having left . But , you see , you left me once  --  true , with the war for an alibi and , true , you came back that time . But what if you 'd left me again one day , as it seemed all too clear you would  --  and so , very stupidly , I acted first MARTIN Mom , that 's not what you wrote ELISE Let 's say it was . And let 's say you did not sneak it off the bureau that night knowing I was confused , because I taught you never to abuse anyone in their dark hour . And when the letter arrived , and your father learned how I felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREW ( shaken ) Elise . A little restraint . A little balance . That 's all I ever asked . ELISE Then why fall in love with me ? ANDREW And if you wanted all this passionate excess ELISE Yes . Mysteries . ANDREW Water under the bridge . ELISE Is it ? ( ELISE takes out a cigarette , testing a memory . ANDREW understands . With a practiced gesture , he slips an expensive lighter from his pocket , lights her cigarette . She notes the lighter . ) It used to be wooden matches . You 've come up in the world . And I 'll bet you still do n't smoke . p. 95 ANDREW ( softer ) I would like to help out in some way  --  financially , whatever . ELISE No doors are shut . ANDREW Maybe at the end of the summer before Martin leaves , we could plan a weekend . MARTIN You 'll see us ? ELISE Shhh , darling , you 've meddled enough . ANDREW Do you still  --  ever dance ? ELISE They closed the Saint George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could forget . Monday-night folk dancing ANDREW God , yes , in the barn . Cedric , Emma , Phillip , all the true believers out there trying to learn , what was it ? ELISE The Wedding Stomp BOTH ( shared joke ) of the Ukrainian Goatherd . ELISE ( laughs ) With whom we 'd all , come the Revolution , be tending our flocks one day ANDREW in Central Park , no doubt . ( Animated , to MARTIN ) Lise and I ( corrects himself ) Your mother and I had our own secret victrola , no one knew . We 'd sneak away from the barn with an armful of 78s p. 96 ELISE And that horrible cheap vodka ANDREW You could drink any Russian we ever met straight under the table ELISE You see , darling , a thing of legend , my capacity ANDREW Take turns winding that infernal machine ELISE and dancing , dancing in the woods all alone to , oh God , Rudy Vallee ANDREW Eddy Duchin ELISE Horror , so bourgeois , Guy Lombardo , our dirty little vice ANDREW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ANDREW The Holy Warriors ! ELISE ( to MARTIN ) With me , your father could relax and be silly , oh so silly , and human , and adorable ( sings ) I saw you last night and gotthat old feeling ( She sings next line and hums rest of verse . ELISE moves towards ANDREW , humming as the old movements fill her body . For a moment , ANDREW resists what he 's feeling , but finally begins to yield . PENNY enters , trying to control her fury. ) p. 97 PENNY You know , I think it would be a terrifically good idea to have at least one person saying good-bye out there who actually belongs to this family . MARTIN ( pushing her out of room ) Leave us alone . Close the door . No one comes in here . ANDREW He overdid the drink tonight , my fault , Elise , sorry . MARTIN ( returns ) You 're getting along now , do n't stop . Keep talking . ANDREW Hey , champ , a little cold water on the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELISE towards ANDREW by the hand ) You two dance together , I 'll go inside , I 'll clean up , I 'll take care of everything , you stay here alone and dance ANDREW For Christ sake , get a hold of yourself . MARTIN Forget about me , I 'm not here . ANDREW That 's enough , Martin , no more ! ELISE Do n't you dare talk to him that way . MARTIN He 's right , Mom , I had too much to drink , it 's my fault . ELISE No one here is at fault , angel . p. 98 MARTIN ( icy ) I ruin everything . Do n't look at me . Do n't make me be here . ANDREW Will you stop this pathetic whining ? Wait in the living room . ELISE You have no right to order my son around . I want you to apologize . ANDREW He 's getting away with murder , and you encourage it , all your weaknesses  --  the lies , the evasions , the self-pity ELISE You bastard , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing against you in all these years , but he 'll hear the truth now , all of it ANDREW Truth ? You do n't know the meaning of the word . You told him I thought he was a mistake , is n't that what you said ? ELISE Your behavior is all he needs to know that . ANDREW Listen to the way you bend and twist everything ELISE Like the money ? ANDREW Oh , yes , I can imagine what a meal you 've made of that one MARTIN What money ? ELISE You see , I never even mentioned it , you have an unbiased ear , go on , Andrew , tell your son about the money p. 99 ANDREW Seeing you now , I do n't regret it ELISE Hundreds , was it ? Thousands ? ANDREW is that the issue ? ELISE he never said  --  winnings from a poker game on the troop ship home , and how did he spend it ANDREW after three and a half years of my life ELISE on his son , on his family ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about so passionately for years ; no ! ANDREW what was left when I returned ? ELISE he spent it on clothes ! That 's right , this man of the people , who claimed to care nothing about dress in all his life went and ordered an entire wardrobe , tailor made , just to walk among his former comrades and look as if he had n't fallen behind . ANDREW That is a complete crock of shit and you know it ELISE Ah , so we 've hit a nerve at last ANDREW I came home to nothing at all , that 's what happened ! ELISE You never came home , only half of you , and that half was all rage and judgment p. 100 ANDREW Was I supposed to forgive what happened while I was gone ? ELISE Nothing happened , Andrew ANDREW How damn right you are , worse than nothing  --  all we 'd worked for , all we 'd begun to build , they just walked away from it the same as they walked away from a filthy , thankless war we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again , who did the dirty work ? The same fool who organized meetings and settled disputes and trusted when he left they 'd keep faith with the movement in some real way , not Cedric in his ivory tower of books and theory ; in the streets , in the factory , anything , anything but abandon it to chase after their own precious careers . Well , I can play that game , too . I can out-abandon and out-career and out-dress that whole crowd till they see just how ugly their betrayal truly looks ELISE You see every betrayal but your own . ANDREW I see what they let themselves forget . ELISE Have you forgotten the night you trembled in my arms and cried ? ANDREW My God , now it 's arms , crying ca n't we please stick to the subject for five minutes ? ELISE The night you showed me everything p. 101 ANDREW Fine , I was shipping out , you feel emotional , what are you trying to make it into ELISE What you know it was ANDREW A few tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember it , you who ca n't lie , say you do n't know it was a vow to live always by the moments that bind us , to measure ourselves against the power of our hearts , and with that strength everything we dreamed of making happen was possible . Say it . ANDREW ( beat ) Then why did you abandon me ? Why ? Why , Elise ? ELISE You 're the one who went away . ANDREW But I returned , and you 'd gone to them . I saw it the moment I stepped off the ship  --  you could n't even bring yourself to look me in the eye ELISE You fool , I was crying ANDREW All year ? Were you crying when they 'd visit and the room fell stony silent when I 'd dare remember that our gatherings used to have a real purpose , and you 'd float off to the kitchen in , what , embarrassment at my naive persistence ? And when you 'd sleep alone on the couch , or stay out late with Martin  --  God knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold onto , were you crying then ? p. 102 ELISE I was afraid , Andrew  --  afraid of how I 'd missed you  --  of needing you again as much as when you went away . It was pride , both of us , do n't you see , stupid , foolish pride . We 're human . We make mistakes . Ca n't we forgive now ? ANDREW Wonderful , now we forgive . Does anything stay put with you ? No wonder I had to get away . What do you want from me , what ? Do you even know ? Unity , Brotherhood , Power of our Hearts , it 's all talk and I was dumb enough to believe it meant something , for five of the most wonderful fucking years of my life I trusted no more . They 're through with me , I 'm through with them . I 'll live my own way , I 'll count on no one , and I 'll wear any damn thing I please ( stops , shaken ) ELISE ( pause ) Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt cheated of all that lonely , heroic time lost , and angry that things change , and we 'll hold each other like we did that night until it all goes away . ANDREW ( pause ) No more , Elise . Between us , the silence is a better idea . ELISE And that , dear Andrew , is what finally makes you small ANDREW Do n't do this ELISE and sad p. 103 ANDREW I 'm warning you ELISE and so very , very alone . ANDREW ( threatening gesture ) Shut up , shut up , damn it . ELISE Are you going to hit me ? ANDREW ( murderously ) You are such a dangerous woman . ELISE And you 're not worthy of me . MARTIN Mom , stop it . ELISE Go ahead , strike . Sooner or later you would have . Kill what comes too close . ANDREW ( to MARTIN ) Wait outside . ELISE We 're going . You have what you always wanted , the goodies of the world . And the little changeling boy is mine . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . MARTIN I 'm staying here . ELISE Get your jacket . MARTIN I 've made up my mind . There will be no discussion . ELISE ( pause ) Say something to him , for God 's sake ! Andrew ! ( Pause . ELISE exits . Pause. ) p. 104 MARTIN Dad ? ANDREW ( shaken ) Fine . I 'm fine . Lost my bearings for a minute . Sorry you had to see that . MARTIN Everything 's kind of screwy tonight . She makes you all tangled up . I know why you had to get away . ANDREW I could use a drink . ( Beat ) No . Had enough . MARTIN It wo n't change our plans , will it ? We 'll still travel together PENNY ( enters ) Everyone 's gone now , and P.S. , I 'm real pissed off . ANDREW Put some coffee on , toots , we 'll be right in . PENNY Good-bye , Andrew . Do n't bother to call . ( Exits ) ANDREW ( beat ) She turned heads , that woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you talk to her ANDREW Everyone wanted her . Thought I never stood a chance in hell . One night , knock-knock-knock ; her . " We must visit Russia together and see what 's really going on there . " She never mentioned the subject again . p. 105 MARTIN Can I help you straighten up ? ANDREW Hmmm ? No need  --  cleaning lady . ( Beat ) She had such promise . MARTIN Dad , are we still on for Europe ? ANDREW Something about being tied down . It 's not in me . Sorry , kiddo . MARTIN The hotel has to know if I 'm going to quit early . ANDREW I know what you want . It 's too late for all that to happen now . We can be friends . Play it by ear . I 'm glad as hell you 're back . MARTIN I want to travel with you , Dad . I want to stay here . I do n't want to see her again  --  ever . ANDREW She needs someone . Go home . Apologize . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be with her when you did n't . ANDREW Not the point . You make a mess , you clean up . MARTIN Well guess what , Dad . Fuck you . Just go fuck yourself , because it 's not my mess , and I 'm not cleaning up after you any more ( exits ) ANDREW Martin Martin , God damn it , you 're a man now , stop asking for help ELSEWHERE ( ELISE 'S PLACE ) ( ELISE lies sprawled on fold-out bed , cover thrown aside , in a light , restless sleep . MARTIN appears in doorway holding suitcase . He watches her for a moment , turns to go , then sets down valise , enters room and tries to pull covers gently over her . A flask falls on the floor with a clatter , waking ELISE . She props herself up , groggy with booze and sleep . They look at each other. ) p. 106 ELISE So , the prodigal son returns . MARTIN I 'm leaving . ELISE Yes , sneaking off into the night . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find plenty of company at the Copper Pot . ELISE What did you say ? MARTIN Is n't that how you work overtime ? Is n't that what you were doing on Parent 's Day ? ELISE How dare you , after how you behaved tonight . Humiliate me in front of that man , steal my secrets , treat me like a foolish , irresponsible mother  --  you do not side against your own flesh and blood . MARTIN He 's my flesh and blood , too ELISE He is no part of my child  --  he ran away . MARTIN So did you . ELISE From a man who did n't want us ! MARTIN Who 'd ever want us , Mom ? Look at how we are , I 'm the same as you , full of the same crooked stuff inside , the same stupid pipe dreams that 'll never happen ELISE That is unworthy of you MARTIN ( withering sarcasm ) Oh , I 'm sorry , Mom , let 's play I 'm the Genius Boy , and next week you 'll stop drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up no , let 's play we do n't even need him because we 're going to have a home of our very own p. 107 ELISE But we are , I 've promised you MARTIN Cut it out , Mom , you know it 's just a pipe dream ! ELISE Is that so ? Then suppose you tell me what you call this , Mr. Cynical , Mr. Ingratitude , Mr. Holier-Than-Thou ( she rummages in bedclothes ) MARTIN What are you doing ? ELISE Our land ! ( Searches desperately ) It was right under two acres MARTIN Put some clothes on , for God 's sake . ELISE ( finds envelope ) Voila ! Now what do you have to say for yourself ? MARTIN ( seeing her ) You 're disgusting , Mom . You 're sloppy , and careless , and drunk . This is why you do n't want me at home , is n't it ? ELISE ( lowers envelope , defenseless ) Yes . It 's enough I have to see myself each day  --  why should you have to . MARTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have no secrets  --  no real ones . ( ELISE looks away , silent. ) p. 108 MARTIN ( takes her robe ) Put this on . ( ELISE is motionless . ) MARTIN I could stay for the summer . ( Beat ) I 'll find a job in the city . Sleep in the other room . I can make you happy , Mom , I know I can . ELISE No ! It 's time for you to go  --  to the summer , to Europe , to all the rest of it . Only promise me this : You 'll never run from life , no matter how it hurts and burns let it touch you everywhere , and live ! ( Pause . MARTIN , impossibly drawn to comfort her , to make her happy , to move past the skin that separates them , embraces her . They hold each other and fall back on the bed together , faces inches apart , he above . A dangerous moment before an irrevocable act . ELISE suddenly pushes him aside , and he moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Pause . ) MARTIN Why ca n't things be different ? ELISE ( beat ) Because , my angel , none of us can choose the way we love . Any complaints , see the man in the moon . MARTIN ( pause ) I 'd better get started . ELISE Oh , dear , yes , it 's getting light . I used to love Monday . Shall I take a half day off ? We could grab a Sloppy Joe breakfast together and talk of cabbages and kings . We 'll count the stairs going down , odd ones for me , even for you . p. 109 MARTIN No , Mom . I can wait a minute if you want to come down with me . ELISE You run along . I have a few things to do before I 'm ready to greet the day . Take a taxi , here ( reaches for her handbag ) MARTIN We ca n't afford a taxi . I 'll take the bus . ELISE You have his eyes , you know . MARTIN I have my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighten all this later . MARTIN Sure , Mom . Sure you will . ( They hug awkwardly ) See you . ( MARTIN exits . ELISE listens to the door close . ) ELISE May you be loved one day even half as well as I 've loved you . Good-bye , my angel . ( Beat ) Good-bye . ( ELISE sits alone . Lights fade. )
