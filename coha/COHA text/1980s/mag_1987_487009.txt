The United States , the world 's number-one debtor nation , may be heading for history 's biggest bankruptcy . If that occurs , it will drag the world down with it , whether capitalist or communist , developed or underdeveloped . Even a new bull market would not cure the basic disorders of the U.S. economy . It is not just that something has to be done about the Federal deficit and the trade deficit . The whole country is in hock . One of the delusions of supply-side economics was that massive tax cuts would lead to a sharp rise in the volume of savings . But the savings rate  --  as a percentage of disposable income after taxes  --  has been cut by more than half during the Reagan years . It was 7.1 percent in 1980 and 4.3 percent in 1986 . This year it has averaged 3 percent and is currently closer to 2 percent . That is a precipitous drop . This is reflected in the biggest consumer binge of all time , based increasingly on credit . Since 1980 , private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgages , has almost doubled . It was a shade above $1.3 trillion in 1980 . The latest 1987 estimate is almost $2.5 trillion . Every American seems to have acquired not just one but several credit cards . With all that funny money , who needs counterfeiters anymore ? The public debt in the Reagan era rose even faster than the private did . It more than doubled . The Federal debt went from $742.8 billion in 1980 to $1.87 trillion at the end of the second quarter of 1987 . State and local debt rose from $295.3 billion to $533.1 billion . Total government debt is now almost $2.5 trillion , only a shade behind the private . Together they add up to almost $5 trillion . The Reagan Ad-ministration , while preaching the old-fashioned virtues , has inspired an era of unprecedented profligacy . The trade deficit is another of its aspects . That deficit was $31.4 billion in 1980 . The latest estimate , on the basis of the first eight months of this year , is $170.3 billion . It is growing although the dollar has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , a de facto devaluation that was supposed to make U.S. products competitive again . All this helps explain the hysteria on the stock market and why yields on long-term government bonds are in the double digits again . The bill collector is at the door . But political leadership is reluctant to answer the bell . The early warning was sounded by George Bush in the 1980 Republican nominating campaign before his eyes were clouded by the vice presidency . He had said we could n't have a stepped-up arms race , a tax cut and a balanced budget . We are suffering the consequences of this " voodoo economics . " But he is now advocating what he once denounced , saying no , just like Reagan , to any tax increase or defense cut . His only concrete contribution to the economic debate is a proposal to cut capital gains taxes , a supply-side snake oil that would add to the deficit in order to refuel speculation . This is like trying to stem drug addiction by cutting the price of narcotics . The United States needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil and Mexico . But the International Monetary Fund does not dare scold us as it does them . Nor do we hear any clear voice from the Democratic candidates . They remember too well what happened to Mondale when he dared utter the dirty word " taxes " in 1984 . Already Treasury Secretary Baker is suggesting that the stock market had started to crash because Democrats in Congress had proposed a few nickel-and-dime additions to corporate levies and a curb on takeovers . Reagan reverted to his old language as a sportscaster and offered as argument against new taxes or defense cuts only the word " nuts ! " Only after a Black Monday and a Wild Tuesday was he prevailed upon to hint , though still Delphically , at a possible compromise on the deficit . The vocabulary itself is enough to scare foreign investors . Any cuts must come out of civilian expenditures . But if you set aside interest on the debt , entitlements ( like Social Security and Medicare ) and the great untouchable of " defense " ( which is really the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government entirely would n't erase this year 's deficit . The total bill for all departments other than defense as proposed in the Reagan budget for 1988 is almost $118 billion . The 1988 deficit is now projected to be $185 billion . So you could abolish civil government altogether and still be $67 billion in the red . Reagan has been hoping to stave off the deluge of debt until after he leaves office and then blame Congress and the Democrats  --  and by implication constitutional government itself  --  for the gigantic mess Reaganomics has created . The Profligate Era is ending with a deliberately created gridlock . This could breed a new fascistic mentality . Let us imagine for a moment what would happen if the two parties in Congress escaped from the blighting shadow of Reagan 's veto power and reached agreement on a really radical cut in the deficit . It could begin to restore confidence worldwide . True it would mean some bitter medicine at home , but that may be the one way to avoid a crash recalling 1929 . But that improbable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantically everywhere . It is frightening that the economic crisis coincides with escalation in the Persian Gulf , where classic fears of appearing weak drag the United States and Iran closer to the brink of another and more unsettling Vietnam . We may be at a new chapter in human history when economic distress and war fears exacerbate every regional quarrel on the planet and darken the prospects for superpower accommodation . Labor &; Nicaragua T he award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sdnchez was welcomed by friends of peace and democracy in Central Ameri- ca . Their number includes many of the delegates to the biennial national convention of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , meeting in Miami this week , and we hope they will take the occasion to add organized labor 's backing to the Arias initiative . The prize provides implicit recognition of the fact that regionally led initiatives , rather than directives from the United States , offer the greatest hope for peace in Central America . The Reagan Administration refuses to recognize this principle , however , as its continued lobbying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . The promise of a regional solution to conflict remains threatened by U.S. action . The war at home about who will decide U.S. policy continues , and labor can play an important role in that struggle . At the last A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention , the Central America issue sparked the first floor fight over a foreign policy question in the federation 's history . To the consternation of the leadership , representatives of a range of unions demanded an explicit condemnation of aid to the contras . Their resolution did not succeed , but the one that finally passed called for a negotiated solution to Central American conflicts rather than a military one , and left individual unions considerable freedom to interpret what the requirements of peaceful negotiation are . Moreover , the partial victory over the language of a single convention plank was dwarfed by the political significance of the floor discussion itself . Since the 1950s , organized labor 's internal debate has been stifled by the leadership 's dual commitments to the cold war and to the pursuit of a murderously interventionist foreign policy in the Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment flowed from the United States to repressive military regimes abroad , many workers lost jobs . And as the leadership applauded or assisted in countless U.S.-sponsored wars , coups , assassinations and other forms of terror abroad , organized labor became increasingly separated from its natural allies within progressive communities in the United States  --  as well as potential allies within foreign labor movements that suffered U.S. aggression . By breaking silence on Central America , as Martin Luther King Jr . broke silence on Vietnam a generation ago , those who spoke up at the last convention suggested a radically different vision of labor 's domestic and international role . They showed that organized labor need not be , as its critics maintain , a " special interest " group , single-mindedly bent on achieving material gains for its ( dwindling ) membership and indifferent or hostile to everyone else . It can be a genuine popular voice for democracy , if it recognizes that democracy at home requires democracy abroad and an end to the destructive U.S. policies in which the A.F.L.-C.I.O. leadership remains complicit.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
