Perhaps it is because I devote an all too regular amount of lineage to the pleasures of skiing , sailing and duck shooting that I was invited recently to conduct interviews at a meeting of the Preppie Defense League ( PDL ) . The clear message from this group : " Enough already ! Lay off us ! " Now this outburst was not provoked merely by that coffee-table literary event of the decade , " The Preppie Handbook , " and all of its subsequent fallout . There are matters deeper and weightier bothering the PDL , and its members wanted to thrash them out with me . " The real threat to us , " said PDL executive publicity chairman Whit Roysnand , " is the nouveau preppie . It ' s a movement that started about 20 years ago when they took over tennis on us . Then they moved into sailing and skiing . Anyone with a charge account could suddenly be preppie . That handbook thing , that ' s not about preppies , it ' s about yahoos . " " Yahoos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Volvo station wagons who have moved in and thinned out the true preppie blood . Why , there ' s hardly a yacht club left on the East Coast that hasn ' t been tainted . " " You mean the real preppies don ' t wear alligator shirts and drive Volvos ? " " Well , yes and no , " he said , groping to explain as I was groping to understand him . Finally , he saw that he would have to back up and explain from the beginning . It was all very confusing . Preppies , I learned , are virtually indistinguishable from nouveau preppies ( hereinafter called " yahoos " ) , except to other true preppies . Whit gave me an example of this . To most of the New England-speaking world , madras ( 100 percent cotton ) is believed to be an identifying fabric of the preppie . A man wearing light khaki ( or white duck ) trousers , white non-tennis sneakers and an old , extremely understated madras jacket ( bought in 1961 for a Kingston Trio concert ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are disheveled- looking and way too short . But , said Whit , take a man wearing madras slacks with a plain-colored jacket - just the reverse image - and you have a yahoo , no doubt about it . Yet everyone takes him for a preppie . " And then you ' ll get these guys wearing red pants with embroidered whales with an alligator on their shirt , " Whit fumed . " My God , they look like a walking aquarium . It ' s disgusting enough to look at , but to have people take them for preppies . . . " I began to doubt that I was the reporter the PDL wanted . " I write stories about recreation , " I explained , " not the subtle symbols of a social . . . " " Hang on a minute . I ' m getting to that , " he said . Aside from all their little code symbols , such as the preferred female fashions designed specifically to defeminize their women ' s figures , I learned that there are only two truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all things , and the seriousness of their play . " Real preppies make their own rules , which yahoos try , usually unsuccessfully , to go by , " said Whit . " If a preppie wants to eat salad with his fingers or wear a checkered shirt with a striped tie or go bowling , he does it easily . But a yahoo can ' t . A yahoo trying to find the standards of preppiness is like an airplane pilot trying to find runway lights through the fog . " I recalled for him an afternoon when , as a friend and I played tennis on a public court , two women stepped on and explained that they were scheduled to play in a seeded hospital benefit tournament and that the clay courts at their house were too wet to play on . As they started hitting the ball around , we simply stepped off , convinced not that there was any regulation by which we had to surrender the court but that they had some deeper and perhaps more ancient right to it . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to understand . That ' s preppiness . Not the blather in that handbook . " For one example of the handbook ' s erroneous reporting , he cited the list of preppie places which included Duxbury , a nice little town , Whit thought , albeit one that constantly underestimated its own ordinariness . And yet the same list omitted mention of Cohasset or Hingham , the South Shore ' s only pockets of legitimate vintage prep . A real preppie , Whit went on , valued nothing so much as his play life , a trait that runs well back into the academic years . " Anyone can get into the Ivies , " he said . " All they have to do is work like hell . And that ' s boring and wastes time . That ' s what the yahoos do . But only a preppie could get into the Browns and Yales with combined SAT scores under 1000 and a C-plus average . " I was then introduced to Blackie , a pleasantly ample 35-year-old who had taken nine years to get through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the school year was designed most annoyingly to interfere with ski season . " And most preppies just feel , Well , if I don ' t get through this year , maybe I will next year , ' " Blackie told me . And a few years before that , he said , you could always tell the yahoos at St. Mark ' s , because they really cared if the football team beat Choate . " We would be cheering like hell at the game , too , " he said , " but the yahoos never understood that by Sunday morning , we had forgotten the damn game altogether and were only interested in finding out who had barfed in whose shoes at the party Saturday night . " It turned out that this particular meeting of the PDL was really a 10th reunion of a great party held annually high on a rocky estate overlooking the Atlantic Ocean . The members , all pushing 40 , had grown up sailing together at the same club , but over three decades had found few other people quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After being told all this , I was still at a loss as to why they had singled me out . " You do write about recreation , don ' t you ? " Whit asked . " That ' s at the heart of what we are : The only people who can really understand recreation are people who don ' t need it , you see . We thought you ' d have figured that out by now and could get the word out about us . " Someone has to show the ordinary people out there who are duped by the yahoos that there really is something worthwhile for their grandchildren to shoot for . "
