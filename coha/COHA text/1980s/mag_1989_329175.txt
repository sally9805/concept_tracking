The birth of a band : at a London flat some eight years ago , Shane MacGowan , who had more of his teeth back then , picked up a guitar and started to play an old Irish tune , Paddy Worked at the Railways . He played it fast ; he played it very fast , in the best postpunk , frontal-assault style . His pal Spider Stacy clocked MacGowan 's hands at " 940 light-years an hour . " That time , of course , was unofficial . But looking back now , it has become the official beginning of the Pogues . <P> This aggregation landed its first gig two weeks later . " Hey , " MacGowan said to a local club owner , " we 're in a band that plays Irish Republican songs . Can we do a set here ? " The club owner agreed , and MacGowan , Stacy and three friends were soon doing a 20-minute set of " mutilated Irish rebel songs " that was frequently interrupted , according to Stacy , " by chit- throwing British soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the audience . " <P> A prototypical punk moment . It was loud , adventurous , untutored and self- destructive . Something may have been kindled that night , but it took 18 months to work it into a flame . Now the Pogues burn reckless and bright , working weird wonders on old Irish airs , giving errant folk melodies a strong bracing of rock . The new Pogues album has the kind of title that makes a sucker out of anyone who does n't know the band ; Peace and Love is full of spunk and sass , unreconstructed punk attitude hiding a hard social conscience . Chits will no longer be tossed . <P> The Pogues muscled mainstream folk music out of its rut . Their raucous , carefully heedless style opened the way for the Hothouse Flowers , the Proclaimers and the Waterboys , three of the best bands working the newly fertile field of electric folk . The Pogues redirected and redefined a tradition that even such disparate talents as Tracy Chapman , the Indigo Girls and Suzanne Vega are working to excellent effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Ned of the Hill or White City will not bring a fond smile to folkies who prefer their music mild , like a cup of chamomile , or foursquare , like a sermon on a six-string . MacGowan sing-snarls like a saloon rowdy . His mouth , missing several prominent teeth , has attracted almost as much press attention as his voice , perhaps because they make such a perfect match . There is nothing pretty about a MacGowan vocal ; the beauty comes later , after he has given the ear a good boxing , and the lyrics settle  --  very gently , really  --  on the heart . <P> MacGowan onstage is restless , perhaps combustible . If the other seven band members do a tune in which his involvement is minimal , he will take a hike into the wings . " It 's embarrassing , " he says . " I 'm sitting on my bloody hands . " Even when he 's not in the thick of things , he is the Pogues ' charismatic center . It was MacGowan and his writing that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is older by a decade than the rest of the band , and he played with such mid- ' 70s English electric-folk groups as Steeleye Span , on whose influence the Pogues have drawn extensively . " I 've been through the folk revival ; I 've been through the decline of the revival , " he says . " But I liked MacGowan 's writing . A lot of Irish music had been parlorized by the English . The Pogues took it back to the streets . They were attacking it . "
