( downstage front ) I 'll never do better . She 's good for me . And sweet and vulnerable . A little older than I like them , but she has an innocent , unspoiled quality , even though she 's divorced twice and has two kids . She 's thirty-five . What I find so important is that she needs me , you know ? And she takes my advice ! On her children . Even though I myself have never had children . On investments . On  --  on politics . Women have almost never accepted my advice . Women have always treated me as if I 'm dumber than they are and they 're making an effort not to embarrass me by showing it . A kind of irritation with me sooner or later enters every relationship I have . As if nothing I do is what they expect in a man . But they make allowances because I try so hard . And I do try . Nothing , I take nothing for granted ! I think all the time , What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please her ? Buying candy or little thoughtful knickknacks to show how imaginative I can be , that I 'm not as simple as she thinks . I fight to avoid being pigeonholed . I spend hours of the day with half my mind on what it is she needs from me , trying to understand the side of her she 's not exposing and what I can do to make that side trust me . The secret part of her that she does n't show . How I can win acceptance from that part that no man has ever reached before . I can spend days in the office , on the phone , in conference with clients , consultations , settling problems , and fifty percent of that time I 'm off inside myself trying to figure out ways to make her let me in , let me inside to see something in her no one has seen before . For me , that 's a proof of worth , my claim on immortality . Because , look , I know I 'm not unique in bed ; mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery to me . I mean I 've read all the books and tried the therapies and gone away on couples weekends , and I know less now than I ever did about what to do with a woman . Or even if I make it work for both of us , does it make me feel better ? If a woman tells me how great I am I think she 's exaggerating . But I 'm grateful . And if she tells me I 'm not doing enough to please her , I want to wring her neck even though I assume it 's true . Because should n't I get some credit for all the effort I put in ? And if she 's active , I resent her . And if she 's passive , I resent her . And if she 's talkative , I resent her . And if she makes jokes or is overly serious or athletic or badly coordinated  --  it does n't matter  --  it 's off the mark . Always is . Always . And the distance between what I need and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give that is " love . " Love is not so much an emotion or a feeling . It 's the stuff that fills the void between me and a woman . If that stuff is n't there , then all that exists between us is the gap . We talk across it . We go to movies across it . We drink and go to parties and fuck across it . But the gap counts for more than we do . These are activities . Mere activities . The gap has depth ! This void , this gap between us , has quality and substance and shape . And this woman and I are more or less clients to the gap . Silhouettes . ( Pause . ) With the best will in the world , I tend to make women self-conscious , as if they 're not  --  Very desirable women seem not to know how to behave with me . ( Pause . ) I bring such questions to sex , such a lack of naturalness . I do n't think sex is a truly natural act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary-position sex . That 's still a risk to me . ( Pause . ) I do n't know what the rules are . I have to admit I liked it better when it was repressed . I could understand fucking in order to defy convention . But fucking only for pleasure ! Only pleasure ! What the hell is that ? I do n't see the point . I do n't believe anybody believes in it . I always knew  --  my first time I knew  --  that someday there 'd be payback time . I do n't mean that AIDS is God 's judgment . It 's more my mother 's judgment.Sex without guilt is garbage . It has no moral dimension . No metaphysics . You take the forbidden aspect out of sex , it 's as erotic as golf . ( Pause . ) Today , the average gay person is more manly than I am . Probably has more women friends . I do n't have women friends . Never have . I was taught that women would n't go to bed with men who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls always wanted to befriend me , and I discouraged them . I was taught that Platonic friendships left you sexually suspect , that bad boys made out and nice , kind , unselfish boys did n't . I do n't know if I still believe it . I do n't know . The battle of the sexes . I was raised on James Thurber , but he does n't seem to apply anymore . Not since oral sex . ( Pause . ) You see , I avoid the issue . I begin to talk about love and immediately switch the topic to sex . I do n't know how to talk about love . I know how to talk about sex . I may not know what it is , but I can recognize it if I see it . But love escapes me because it 's about the gap . If sex is about an object filling a hole , love is about a hole filling a hole . Emptiness occupies emptiness and becomes fullness , becomes consuming , gigantic like growing a third arm . Or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invisible one , grow in it 's place , bigger and better but tender to a point of pain . Love exists outside your opinion of it . ( Pause . ) I love this woman . I love running errands for her , picking up her dry cleaning , totting up her checkbook , doing her income tax . It is n't a one-way street : she likes to cook for me and buy my clothes , go with me to pick out a suit or sweater . She cleans my apartment ! What more do I need in bed ? And with me performing my services for her , which are n't considered well , quite manly , and with her performing her services for me , which to say the least are prefeminist services , the old-fashioned-girl services with her as the old-fashioned girl and me as the goody-two-shoes boy , both of us behaving counter to acceptable type , we 've entered into a compact of delicious , dirty guilt . I find something secretive and lustful in picking up her dry cleaning : the cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me like naked flesh . And when she comes up to my place to Mop and Glow my floors and change the bed sheets , the consequences of that awesome , counterfeminist act lead us into sexual frenzy . This is how we succeed in putting the lifeblood back into sex . ( Pause . ) And she is very bright , certainly up to the level of my ex-wife , who used to patronize me , or the other women I 've gone with  --  all better read than I , all quite happy to talk about books I never read or movies I know nothing about and could care less . She does n't do that . That alone would be enough . But it 's more than gratitude . And more than housecleaning . It 's as much physical as anything else . Dumb stuff . The way she sit 's on a chair , with her legs tucked under her and her shoes off . The way she walks , high-waisted , a kind of languid , Southern chic . She 's from Memphis . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I can handle . The way she seems to physically absorb me . ( Pause . ) And how she likes to say in crowded places that she loves me . She says it anywhere . Out loud in the supermarket . On the bus . In elevators . The way she dresses . Simple , just right , and no nonsense . As if good taste does n't involve thought . She has a perfect figure for clothes and wears them as naturally as  --  as  --  something is there . A trace of something that separates her from the ordinary . ( Pause . ) If only she did n't say " piece of cake . " I do n't know where she picked it up , but she says it all the time . I ask her , " How did your day go ? " She says , " Piece of cake . " She 's a real estate broker . " Did you get that co-op off your hands ? " I ask her . " No , but do n't let it get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's another thing she 's always saying : " Do n't let it get to you . " Or " Do n't get upset . " Or " Do n't get carried away . " And she says these things before I am got to , or upset , or carried away . Her assumption that things " get to me , " or " upset me , " or " carry me away , " the impersonal arrogance of that assumption carries me away . And I yell at her : " You 're trying to make me look neurotic , but I 'm not neurotic . I 'm just not as easygoing as you are . You never worry . You leave your children unattended for hours . Or if you get a sitter you accept total strangers . You trust anybody in this city . So when you trust me , what am I to think ? That I 'm just one of the mob , part of that tribe of hundreds , thousands of people on the make  --  criminals , perverts , addicts , con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , of all women walking this land today , trust ? Do you understand now why I 'm upset ? " And she says , " I understand perfectly , " and puts her face so close to mine I get cross-eyed . I flush with emotion . And she says , " I love your smile . " And the gap between us fills and I realize I 'm in love . And then she says , " Do n't get carried away , " and the gap empties . ( Pause . ) " Piece of cake , " she says in response to remarks that do not , by any stretch of the imagination , call for " piece of cake . " " Are you happy ? " I ask her . " Piece of cake . " " Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow night ? " " Piece of cake . " " Let 's make love . " " Piece of cake . " " Was it good for you ? " " Piece of cake . " ( Pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other level she is extraordinary . I thrill to her looks , her charm , her wonderful way of listening as if I am the most enchanting man she has ever known but then , at the end of my anecdote or my confession , to say " Piece of cake ! " makes a mockery out of our relationship . ( Pause . ) I probably ask too much . Who am I to demand of the only woman in twenty years  --  in my life !  --  who treats me as if I 'm singular , intelligent even , as if I count who am I to make these demands ? What are my grounds ? Can I say  --  dare I say ?  --  " Stop saying ' piece of cake ' and I will marry you " ? Can I say that ? She 'd think I 'm crazy . But I do n't feel crazy . I feel obsessed . I believe , to the root of my being , that if she would only change in these infinitesimal ways that I 'm sure bother no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd only stop telling me not to get upset and carried away , I swear to you on a stack of Bibles that the doubts I harbor about her , that the desire to run away from her followed a minute later by the desire to spend the rest of my life with her , would be , once and for all , resolved . ( Pause . ) And tomorrow , after six weeks of seeing each other three times a week , Joanna is meeting my friends . p. 3 BLACKOUT p. 4 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 Evening . The lobby of a chic Chicago apartment building on the Near North Side . A mirror , a bench , an elevator . JOANNA Tell me again . ELLIOT They 're just the guys , that 's all . Nothing to be afraid of . JOANNA Bobby , Phil , and Leo . ELLIOT Larry . JOANNA Larry 's the one who just got divorced . ( ELLIOT nods . ) Piece of cake . ELLIOT And Bobby is married to Vera , and Phil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He owns a paint company . He makes the paint , he does n't paint houses himself . He 's a businessman . Optimum Paints . JOANNA Do n't get upset . ELLIOT I 'm not upset . They 're waiting for us . We 're late . JOANNA Elliot , it 's only eight o'clock . Do n't get carried away . ELLIOT You 're the one who wanted to meet my friends . JOANNA Well , do n't you think it 's just about time ? p. 5 ELLIOT I love you , Joanna . ( Pause . ) Look , they already know you . I 've done nothing but rave about you to them . You 're not going in there as a stranger . They love you . ( Pause . ) What are you thinking ? JOANNA You look very nice . I 'm so glad you picked that suit over the one I wanted . You look radically handsome in it . ELLIOT You look good enough to eat . ( They kiss . ) JOANNA Larry is black ? ELLIOT Bobby is black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They split up . JOANNA Is he here alone ? ELLIOT He 's here with his wife , Vera . This is their apartment . They live here . JOANNA His wife took him back ? ELLIOT No one 's supposed to know about this . I do n't know what Vera knows . JOANNA She 's white ? ELLIOT ( impatient ) Joanna . Black . She 's a supervisor at the telephone company . JOANNA ( memorizing ) House painter telephone company . Who 's the accountant then  --  Larry ? p. 6 ELLIOT Phil . JOANNA Then what 's Larry ? Is he the one who hates women ? ELLIOT He does n't hate them . He just got out of a lousy marriage . JOANNA He did something just awful to her , though ? ELLIOT It 's complicated . JOANNA He did something . Do n't tell me . Is n't he the one who stole his wife 's car when they split up and drove it off a cliff ? ELLIOT That does n't mean he hates women . JOANNA He hates cars ? ELLIOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me it 's funny . Well , I know it 's funny . Do n't you think I know , Elliot ? Is it always necessary to point it out to me ? ELLIOT I 'm sorry if I do that . Is it really that important , I mean , to discuss this right now ? JOANNA You do n't laugh at my jokes , you identify them . You do not ever laugh at me . It provokes me . I love you anyhow . ELLIOT I 'm sorry . Do n't worry about Larry . He 's had a year of therapy since he drove the car off the cliff . JOANNA Piece of cake . I 've drawn a blank on Phil . Is he the alcoholic ? p. 7 ELLIOT Phil may be an alcoholic . He 's got it under control . JOANNA We all drink too much . ELLIOT Try not to drink so much around Phil . I do n't mean just you . Me too . JOANNA Phil will have to take care of himself . Tonight I have my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to get used to Phil . JOANNA Does Phil have a girlfriend ? First tell me what he does . ELLIOT He 's the accountant . JOANNA And Bobby 's the one who works for Playboy . He 's the one with the black wife , Violet . ELLIOT Vera is her name . JOANNA She works . She works for ELLIOT AT&amp;T . JOANNA I was going to say that . I have it together . How do I look ? ELLIOT You know what I think . JOANNA Hair all right ? ELLIOT Joanna , let 's go . Please . I love you . JOANNA Do n't get carried away . ELLIOT I 'm not . I 'm just a little . p. 8 JOANNA I love your tie . Did I buy that for you ? It looks very smart with that shirt . Your friends are going to think I do n't live up to you . ELLIOT ( beams ) I think you look beautiful . JOANNA Did you see that story in the Tribune this morning ? Mayor Sawyer  --  ELLIOT Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliot . ELLIOT Can you tell me upstairs ? JOANNA Now calm down . Mayor Sawyer was in his limo on his way to a meeting on the North Side , when he spotted an old lady being mugged  --  are you all right ? ELLIOT I just think we should get upstairs . JOANNA Do n't let it get to you . And he got out of his limo  --  ELLIOT Whose limo ? JOANNA Mayor Sawyer . ELLIOT Why are we talking about Mayor Sawyer ? JOANNA It was a story . I 'm telling you this amusing story from today 's Tribune in order to relax you . ELLIOT Can you tell me in the elevator ? p. 9 JOANNA For pity 's sake , we 're going ! Do n't be rude . May I finish ? He breaks up the mugging . And the police come . And they ask him his name . No one knows who he is ! ELLIOT Would n't you say it 's rude to be twenty-five minutes late to a dinner ? JOANNA Elliot , no one , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one recognized the Mayor . ( A long exchange of stares . ) Piece of cake . I just want to go over my notes . ELLIOT That 's also funny  --  notes . JOANNA I 'm not joking . ( Scans notes . ) ELLIOT What are those ? Seriously , Joanna . JOANNA Do n't get hot and bothered . ELLIOT What notes ? Let me see ! JOANNA Now do n't let it get to you . It 's nothing at all . Just little reminders of what you like to have me talk about : the drugstore story , the Marshall Field story , the day I ran away from the kids . ELLIOT Oh , Joanna . JOANNA Your friends , Phil and Bobby and Larry , should like these . ( Finishes with notes . ) Okay . I must say , I 'm exhausted . p. 10 ELLIOT You 're making too much of this . JOANNA They 'll take to me , wo n't they , Elliot ? ELLIOT No , it 'll be fine . Fine ! JOANNA Because if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have problems but this is not going to be one of them . JOANNA What problems do we have ? ELLIOT I just mean  --  JOANNA This is a fine time to bring up our problems . ELLIOT You 're the one who 's always telling me , " Do n't let it get to you . " JOANNA This time I believe you are the naive one . ELLIOT You may be right . JOANNA Stop humoring me ! You are naive , Elliot . You believe everything I tell you  --  even when I 'm lying  --  so how can I trust your assurances about your friends ? ELLIOT You do n't lie . About what ? JOANNA You 're not even curious . I take advantage of you , Elliot . ELLIOT Please . Not now . JOANNA You know when we go out to dinner and I insist that this time it 's on me and then I never have enough money and you have to pay ? p. 11 ELLIOT It 's funny . It 's charming . So what ? JOANNA I have the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times . I do n't want to spend it . You 'll never want to see me again when you hear this : I hate to spend money . I never pay for anything if I can help it , not even when I lunch with my girlfriends . They 're onto me . It embarrasses them so that they do n't bring it up , but they know very well what a cheapskate I am . You never guessed ? ELLIOT You 'd pay for me if it was important . JOANNA I would never pay for you . ELLIOT You do n't mean that . JOANNA I would rather die than pay for you . ( Pause . ) I will buy things only for my children . Are you upset ? ELLIOT Joanna , we were supposed to be upstairs half an hour ago . Please , I beg you ! JOANNA I 'd move heaven and earth for my children . I save all my money for my children 's future . None of us can be sure about the future . I ca n't predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ELLIOT I agree . It 's perfectly understandable . JOANNA You do n't know what it means to have children . It does n't mean I do n't love you . How did you get to be so old and not have children ? It 's very selfish of you , really . How did your wife let you get away with it ? Without children , there 's no substance to life . I 'm sure that 's why she left you . p. 12 ELLIOT She left me for another man . JOANNA And now she has children . ELLIOT I want children , Joanna . I have always wanted children . JOANNA If you wanted a child , you 'd have one by now ! ELLIOT I 'd want a child with you . JOANNA I do n't want any more children . ELLIOT Then what are we talking about ? JOANNA I 'm trying to understand the kind of man you are . Are you truly that selfish ? I do n't believe you are . What 's the answer ? ELLIOT Look , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much they like me . JOANNA It 's easy for you . It 's not the same . You 're not a real person until you 're a parent . You 're a shadow . You 're one-dimensional . ELLIOT How can you talk to me this way ? I take care of you . I run errands . I serve you . JOANNA Remember , I serve you too . I 'd respect you more if you did n't talk about it . I hate you for saying that . ELLIOT I ca n't stand you hating me , Joanna . JOANNA Calm down . It 's not all that serious . p. 13 ELLIOT How can we go up to my friends with you hating me ? You know how late we are ? How can you have secrets if you love me ? JOANNA I do n't believe anyone 's ever loved you before . I must protect myself . ELLIOT This hurts . JOANNA Do n't be vulnerable with me now , Elliot . It 's unkind . ELLIOT I know tonight is a strain JOANNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us if they do n't like me . ELLIOT Then the hell with'em ! JOANNA We will have a hard time surviving it . Believe me . You know these men a lifetime . For example , I have two friends whom you will meet  --  my two closest friends  --  ELLIOT Joanna  --  JOANNA Walter and Fay Derringer . ELLIOT You 've told me about them . JOANNA Please bear with me . And they are always touching each other , Walter and Fay , in front of me . ELLIOT What are you saying ? I do n't touch you enough ? JOANNA Do n't anticipate me . You touch me just fine . I do n't know why , two people when they come together , the rest of the world changes dimension . Is the rest of the world so intolerable that just because you 've found one other person , a man you prefer to be with  --  p. 14 ELLIOT Is this going to take long ? JOANNA  --  and when an outsider , a friend , breaks into that equation , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we 're yammering away , I can see , visually see Walter disappearing before my eyes . The way my father did when my mother and her sisters held court . As if a woman diminishes a man if she 's not paying full attention . Which is why I 'm afraid sometimes because we 've been alone , truly alone , and now I 'll meet your friends and the next step is you will meet mine and forgive me , Elliot , but I find this just a bit threatening . Is that crazy ? ELLIOT But sooner or later , Joanna  --  JOANNA I know that ! Forgive me , I 'm demented . But I do have a point . I know I do . This changes everything . ELLIOT We have to meet each other 's friends eventually . JOANNA I want to meet your family . ELLIOT I do n't believe this is happening ! JOANNA What do you want me to do ? ELLIOT This was n't my idea . JOANNA Let 's stand'em up . ELLIOT Be reasonable . JOANNA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 15 ELLIOT What do you want me to do ? What am I supposed to do ? JOANNA I 'm not ready . I 'm not sure I want to be judged yet . ELLIOT It 's too late , Joanna . JOANNA You go on up . ELLIOT I 'm sorry . This is my fault . I 'm sorry . I should n't have rushed it . What will I tell them ? What can I possibly say ? JOANNA Do n't say anything . Please do n't say anything . Please do n't tell them anything about me . Come home with me now , Elliot ! ELLIOT I ca n't do this , Joanna . JOANNA I 'm going home . What are you going to do ? ( ELLIOT rings for the elevator . It opens and he steps in . The door closes on him . ) ELLIOT ( muffled ) It 's 22G ! JOANNA ( facing elevator ) Piece of cake . BLACKOUT p. 16 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 Evening . The terrace of a high-rise . Upstage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving about as at a small party . ELLIOT stands at the terrace railing , a drink in his hand . He is looking nowhere . The terrace door opens and VERA , an attractive black woman in her thirties , steps out . We hear laughter from the party behind her before she closes the door on it . VERA Weatherwise , you have no complaints . The Big Dipper . ( Pause . ) Look , Elliot . ELLIOT ( does n't look ) I ca n't locate the Big Dipper , Vera . I never have . VERA That 's silly . There 's the cup and there 's the handle . Do n't look at me , look where I 'm pointing . Okay ? ELLIOT ( does n't look ) It 's a bunch of stars to me , Vera . VERA Oh , you 're not even trying . ELLIOT I 've never understood the big deal about the Big Dipper . VERA ( laughs ) You 're so funny . My seventeen-year-old , Chuckie , he has no curiosity either . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college . p. 17 ELLIOT ( irritated ) Did I say I do n't have curiosity ? ( Pause . ) I do n't think I learned anything in college . VERA There had to have been one good teacher , Elliot . ELLIOT Do n't misunderstand me , I do n't blame the teachers . I have a hard time I guess listening . VERA Our people have to go to college , Elliot . It 's different with you . ELLIOT I was n't interested in school  --  not for a day , not for a minute . VERA You 're too intelligent to talk that way . ELLIOT Did I say I was n't intelligent ? VERA No . I said you 're very intelligent . ( Pause . ) Elliot , you 're just down on the world tonight . With good reason . You hear what I 'm saying to you ? ELLIOT College prepares you for the wrong things . It does n't make you educated . It 's bull ! It 's no more or less than a union card . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's useful , it 's necessary . You went , I went . You do very well . Would you do as well if you had n't gone to college ? ELLIOT Henry Ford did n't go to college . Thomas Edison . ( Pause . ) Lincoln . ( Pause . ) Lawyers were n't required to go to law school before the First World War . p. 18 VERA You would n't want a doctor who did n't go to medical school . ELLIOT The family doctor , the old family doctor of fifty years ago with half as much education  --  people thought he was God . VERA Ignorant people . ELLIOT Everybody ! VERA What 're you telling me ? I should n't send my black baby to college ? What do you want him to do  --  shine shoes ? ELLIOT Oh , come on , Vera . Not tonight . Not tonight , please . All I 'm saying is there are too many people around who give a college education too much importance . I work with a bunch of jerks , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better of me . Send the kid to a good computer school ; colleges are done for . I know what I 'm talking about . VERA You 're just in a bad mood . College gives you the preparation , Elliot . Do n't say no . You ca n't overlook preparation . Okay ? ELLIOT Shove the preparation ! VERA ( near tears ) Well , you may be ready to throw out the baby with the bath water ! ELLIOT Oh , listen , I do n't mean a word of what I 'm saying . You 're right , Vera , you do n't want to listen to me. p. 19 VERA Sometimes you just go too far . Okay ? ( Starts to leave . ) No , I understand . Come in when you feel more like it . ( Exits inside . ) ELLIOT ( vehement , at stars ) Big fucking Dipper ! ( LARRY and PHIL , both in their forties , enter from living room , talking . They talk only to each other , but most of their focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . ) PHIL Well , you ca n't blame Sinatra for living too long . LARRY I ca n't look at him the way he combs his hair now . Who 's he trying to kid ? The man 's a parody ! If he died at forty-five  --  Maggio , " Songs for Swinging Lovers "  --  he 'd be the stuff of legend instead of what ? Some kind of sub-Mafia , Atlantic City joke . Stars who live too long , it 's sick ! PHIL Not James Dean . LARRY My point , exactly . Try to imagine a potbellied , baggy-eyed , balding , coke-sniffing Jimmy Dean . Disgusting ! Jimmy Dean at thirty-five , forty-five  --  impossible . He went at the right time . But Sinatra , or take Brando PHIL Take Brando , please ! LARRY A disgrace ! Brando . People live past their own ripeness . It 's not age , it 's ripeness . Cary Grant . Astaire . They were still ripe in their eighties . But if you want to name names , Presley. p. 20 PHIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right time . LARRY But not Nixon . He should have passed over ten minutes after Watergate . But look at him . He would n't die if you drove a wooden stake through his heart . PHIL He 'd take it as a deduction . LARRY Paul Newman . He can carry off sixty . A hell of a job , the amount of beer he consumes and all . The man 's the cream of the crop . But Tony Curtis ? I do n't think he 's any older than Paul and he looks a hundred . PHIL Hard living . LARRY Do n't give me hard living . Paul races at Le Mans , for Christ 's sake . These men are legends ; they should know when to stop . PHIL Would you know ? Would I know ? LARRY It 's not our job to know . We 're not living legends , we 're living assholes . Nobody notices how we age because everyone who knows us ages at the same rate . But movie stars , politicians  --  they leave a film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry Lewis today . Tell me that 's not demoralizing . I look at him on one of these fucking telethons , I feel like pledging two million for him to retire . PHIL Mike Wallace  --  he goes on forever . p. 21 LARRY Ageless . But Sinatra  --  he was my hero , I worshipped Sinatra . When I came on to girls I came on like I was Sinatra . Why does he do this to me ? Let me tell you something : if Jesus lived to be sixty , he would n't have a religion named after him . Elliot  --  look at him . He looks worse than Sinatra . PHIL Elliot was born looking old . LARRY Because he worries too much . In high school , the worrywart , remember ? He was always worried . The worrywart , we called him . Remember ? PHIL Yeah , I remember . I remember we went ice skating once . LARRY Once , sure , once . But what about all the other times when he worried and I did n't fall through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LARRY Look at the price I paid . First he worries I 'll fall through the ice ; then he worries I 'll panic just because I do fall through the ice ; then he worries that I 'll drown him when he jumps in after me ; then he worries I 'll catch pneumonia after he fishes me out . He was the one sick for three weeks after ; I go back to St. George on Monday and play in the finals . Does Elliot play ? No , because he 's worried himself sick over me , who does n't catch a sniffle . So I scored twenty-six points in the finals , and for my sins for celebrating when my best friend 's in bed with a hundred and four temperature , I score with Delores Donahue at the victory party who nobody , we thought , made out with . And she gives me the clap . Because Elliot , Elliot worried . I made him smile . ( PHIL looks over at ELLIOT , who reluctantly smiles. ) p. 22 ELLIOT Fuck you , Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Stares at his empty glass . ) I need another . ( To PHIL : ) You ? Come on , one 's not going to hurt you . PHIL Unh-unh . LARRY What have I got on my hands  --  two worrywarts ? I 'll be back in a flash , Flash . ( Exits to living room . ) PHIL Last time I was out here I peed off the terrace . You ca n't pee off the terrace sober . ELLIOT Larry 's got too much energy for his own good . PHIL Everyone talks about support groups for alcoholics . You know ? Somebody should talk about countersupport groups . " Come on , one little drink wo n't hurt you . " I 've never been offered so many drinks in my life since I went on the wagon . The shit you get away with drunk . You know ? You ca n't drop water bags off a terrace sober . ELLIOT You never did that . PHIL Not here . A couple of years ago . Condoms filled with water . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed with that night . You know ? But I remember the condoms filled with water . That 's what I have nostalgia for . The freedom . I 'm a tightass sober ; I 'm a free man drunk . You know ? I talked women into bed I would n't have the nerve to open my mouth to sober . I made friends . You know ? I could never talk up to people the way Larry does . You know ? But five or six bourbons , I could tell jokes . I do n't know how to tell a joke , but I could tell ' em drunk . You know ? I was better at everything drunk except marriage and work . You know ? And I prefer drinking to both . I bet JFK could put it away . Bet he could hold his liquor too . I bet he was a couple of sheets to the wind all through the Cuban missile crisis . I know I 'd be . Adlai Stevenson and the Joint Chiefs in one room , Judith Exner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeing off a balcony with JFK ? Teddy maybe , not Jack . Jack was a classy drunk . I 'm more like Teddy . Black guys  --  they really pull out the jams drunk . Hispanics too . They get crazy  --  you know ?  --  the music and everything . Crazy . They get high on the noise . Not Jews , though . When Jews get drunk they confuse it with their role in the universe . They do n't have fun , they have insights . You can just bet that Einstein had a bag on the night he came up with E=MC2 . ( ELLIOT laughs . ) You think that 's funny ? You want to put money on Freud being smashed the night he came up with the Oedipus complex ? ( ELLIOT turns away , smiling . ) Karl Marx  --  he came up with communism tanked . You know , Elliot ? Four in the morning , bombed out of his mind . If he had n't made notes , he would have forgotten it the next morning and we 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wasps drunk  --  Wasps drunk are no different from Wasps sober . You know ? Upper-class Wasps , I mean , upper-class . Lower-class  --  they know how to have a good time . But upper-class Wasps , you know  --  you know ?  --  they get paranoid drinking that , that they 'll lose control . Right ? Right . An exaltar boy like me , you know , I only feel in control when I 'm drunk ; but Wasps , who really are in control , when they get drunk they get afraid that they 'll lose it . You 're not smiling . That 's okay too . This is the best time I 've had since I quit drinking , and it 's because you do n't care if I 'm alive or dead . If you 're just holding that glass , Elliot , and not drinking on account of me , you do n't have to . I 'm past that . p. 23 ELLIOT What ? PHIL You know ? Because it does n't bother me . Everyone inside is getting smashed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLIOT Do n't rub it in . I guess I rushed things . PHIL You ? Captain Caution ? What are you talking about ? ELLIOT You think I 'm too cautious ? PHIL What do I know ? The thing with old friends , you know , they think it 's still high school . You know ? I mean how much do we see of each other ? When I do your taxes . ELLIOT More than that . PHIL I 'm not complaining . I can do something about it too . I live two blocks away from here , over on State . I see Bobby  --  a rough guess  --  five , six times a year . You know what I 'm saying ? Do I know you now , you know ? A little , but mostly I know you from St. George , back when . You covered all bases  --  you know ? You thought two steps ahead of everybody . So we have to give that a name . You know ? Because Larry and Bobby and myself  --  we were less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you were terrifically mature for your age . Like you talked like our parents sometimes  --  ELLIOT Thanks a lot . p. 24 PHIL What can I say ? So we called you worrywart and Captain Caution . But what 's that got to do with today ? You were just good at giving advice . You thought about things ; we did n't . But now I think about things too , and I even give advice . ELLIOT You got some for me ? PHIL Sure . This , too , shall pass . ( Pause . ) Your other friends who I do n't know anything about , the world of polltakers are they like us ? ELLIOT I do n't have friends from the job . PHIL I have two good friends who are accountants , but I do n't see them alone . We see each other with our wives . ELLIOT There 's less horsing around with my other friends . Outside of you guys , I do n't have a single friend who I know ten years . PHIL Outside of shoptalk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're the ones I talk real to . ELLIOT Like ? PHIL It 's hard to say . You know ? But I get a lot off my chest . ELLIOT Like me with Joanna . PHIL Yeah , it 's more natural . ( Long pause , during which PHIL looks over at ELLIOT , then front again . BOBBY , a black man their age , enters from the living room with VERA. ) p. 25 VERA The ladies have come to a decision . You men should be free to hang out , so we gals are going bye-bye for a couple of hours . Okay ? ELLIOT You do n't have to do this , Vera . VERA You 'll be more relaxed . Okay ? ELLIOT Where will you go ? I ca n't kick you out of your own apartment . VERA Downtown to a movie . Do n't worry  --  okay ? It 's all arranged , Elliot . We 're well taken care of . ELLIOT How are you going to get there ? Take my car . You do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie . VERA We 'll call for a cab  --  okay ? Now , you have enough on your mind . ELLIOT You do n't want to wait around for a cab late at night , if they show up . VERA Do n't worry . We 're big girls , we can take care of ourselves . ELLIOT Vera , really , I 'm not going to feel right . What time does the movie let out ? Waiting around after midnight for a cab . We 'll come down and pick you up . What time does the movie let out ? VERA We can decide all that later . ELLIOT Maybe we all should go . p. 26 BOBBY Relax , man ! Nobody 's gon na pick on these women . They 're too big , they 're too old , and they 're too mean . ELLIOT Vera , I was off base before . Chuckie has to go to college . If he does n't get on the right track now , who can tell what the job market will be like tomorrow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VERA Be good  --  you hear ? ( Exit 's . ) ELLIOT Jesus , Bobby . Hey , Vera ! I 'll go ! Hey , Vera ! BLACKOUT p. 27 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 Bobby 's study , fifteen minutes later . A dark , book-lined room , very masculine . On the wall , various athletic trophies and businessman merit awards . An advanced-systems stereo , TV , VCR . Many video cassettes lying around . Copies of Playboy lie scattered on a small coffee table . Bottles of Chivas and Jim Beam . A fancy phone system . The four friends lounge about , all but PHIL drinking heavily . BOBBY ( to LARRY ) You shoot off your mouth , but you forget the context . LARRY It 's PMS , do n't shit us , Bobby . ( To ELLIOT : ) I guarantee you , I 've lived through this . BOBBY What Elliot 's talking about is larger than one man , one woman . LARRY I do n't care what you say , Bobby . ( To ELLIOT : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . I do n't lie to you : she was a crazy woman . It was a nightmare . She picked fights over anything . Check it out . Premenstrual syndrome . " Good Morning America " did a whole week on it . This is typical . What you do n't want , you do n't let her get you into an argument on the specifics . Women will kill you on the specifics . That 's their turf : detail . " Larry , you said this . " " You promised me that . " " You did n't come through , Larry . " They grind you into the woodwork with detail . I mean , you want to talk pussy-whipped. p. 28 ELLIOT I 'm not pussy-whipped . LARRY I did n't say you . Me . I 'm saying me . Christ , take it easy  --  all right ? I gave Angela a long rein . You listening to me ? A long rein . Two or three days before her period , I took a hike . It 's fucking hilarious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela : it 's history . LARRY Gim me a break , will ya ? BOBBY It 's history , it 's cultural anthropology . LARRY ( with disdain ) You know , ever since you went to work for Playboy  --  where 's my man , Bobby ? Remember how Bobby convinced us we should order the satin team jackets with our names in script over the pockets ? " Larry . " " Elliot . " " Bobby . " " Flash . " Hey , Phil , you do n't like to be called " Flash " anymore . I liked " Flash . " Let 's take a vote , you guys . Do we call Phil " Flash " or " Phil " ? Raise your hands . ( No one makes a move . ) I vote for " Flash . " Nobody voting with me ? Fuck you all ! Bobby , remember we ordered these jackets on your say-so ? You said you 'd loan us the money , and it 's bullshit ! You do n't have the money any more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred dollars . BOBBY My man Larry 's got a hard-on for the past . You should be ashamed of yourself , man , the words you use  --  " pussy-whip . " Nothing wrong with " pussy-whip . " " Pussy-whip " is marriage in it 's ideal condition . I am pussy-whipped and I am proud ! p. 29 LARRY Gim me a break ! BOBBY Any man with responsibilities , any man with a family is pussy-whipped . " Pussy-whip " is on the side of history . LARRY ( to others ) You believe this ? Do you fucking believe this ! ? I 'm too proud , I 'm too proud . Where 's your pride , Bobby ? BOBBY Man , your pride led you to drive your wife 's BMW off a cliff  --  that 's asshole pride . It 's antihistorical pride . No way . What I have is black family pride . That 's the pride my people call for now , and for this time and this place I not only have it , I glory in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Single men have what ? They have " balls . " Then they get married and what do they have ? " The family jewels . " When you 're single , it 's not " the family jewels . " Oh no . Only with marriage . Single men , they " fool around . " Married men " settle down . " " Fooling around " is lightweight ; " settling down "  --  that 's serious , that 's for real , that 's significant . These are not careless metaphors . They mean exactly what they say . When a man 's balls quit fooling around and settle down and become the family jewels , it 's a significant transformation . They are no more my balls , not Phil 's balls , not Larry 's balls , not Elliot 's ; our balls become community property . They become socialized . This is what we 're talking about  --  you hear ?  --  the socialization of balls . And tell me , what do you get when you socialize balls ? You get " family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's what we call the " future of the race . " We are cogs in a vast , historic continuum . Our balls are not our own , Elliot , they are fodder for the future . So if it 's not this one , this Joanna woman , it 'll be another Joanna , a future Joanna . History does n't care which Joanna , so long as you line up your balls for the long march . Sooner or later , you 've got to get in step , man ! ( To LARRY : ) You too ! p. 30 LARRY Gim me a break ! I do n't hear " family " out of you when you show me your dirty pictures , man . Just because you work for Playboy . What is this  --  guilt ? You 're a fucking hypocrite , Bobby . You want me to believe in " propagation of the species " ? Go to work for Good Housekeeping . ( To others : ) He 's putting us on . The man goes to orgies . BOBBY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come on , man , the pictures ! The pictures ! Show these guys the pictures ! BOBBY I was putting you on . LARRY Now you 're putting me on . You believe in the family ; sure , you do until a piece of ass comes along . BOBBY I 'd be the last to deny that I aim high , and sometimes I do fall . PHIL What pictures , Bobby ? BOBBY Hey , you do n't want to see any pictures . PHIL How come Larry rates and we do n't ? BOBBY ( shrugs ) How you boys do try to corrupt me . PHIL I 'd like to see the pictures , if there are any pictures . I 've got a right to see them . p. 31 BOBBY ( shakes his head ) Elliot ? Well ( pause ) this is your party . ELLIOT What do I care ? BOBBY There is a good time and a bad time . ELLIOT I do n't need you to be my nurse , Bobby . BOBBY ( coldly ) Like the man says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and tosses it to ELLIOT . ELLIOT hesitates , then takes six ten-by-twelve photos out of the envelope . LARRY and PHIL bunch up behind him and stare over his shoulder . As he finishes with one photo , he hands it to LARRY , who examines it and hands it to PHIL . They are quiet for a long while . ) PHIL This is not for real . LARRY ( delighted ) They 're dykes ! PHIL Jesus Christ ! ELLIOT Were they on drugs ? BOBBY I do n't know what they were on . They were on each other  --  I know that . ELLIOT They 're limber  --  I 'll say that . PHIL Fabulous . p. 32 LARRY Fabuloso ! PHIL I find this hard to believe . ELLIOT Two women . BOBBY That turns you on ? ELLIOT They ca n't be eighteen . LARRY What do you want ? ELLIOT Bobby , do they  --  they do this  --  they 're both very beautiful  --  how do they come to do this ? BOBBY Yes you could consider this a performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOBBY A demonstration of sorts . PHIL There 's nothing , nothing sexier , you know , than two women doing it ! Nothing sexier ! Nothing ! ( ELLIOT withdraws . ) LARRY God , I 'd love to be there ! PHIL Right in the middle ! BOBBY Francine and Fredericka . ( Hands PHIL a business card . ) PHIL They got business cards ? LARRY No shit ? How much ? BOBBY I can get you the corporate rate . Elliot ? p. 33 ELLIOT ( feigns interest ) H'yo ! BOBBY Would n't you like to watch these two foxes in action ? Take ' em on after ? LARRY For tonight ? BOBBY Any night you like . PHIL I do n't know what it is two women they really know how to do it . They really know  --  you know ? The right places . LARRY Now wait a minute , Bobby . This is n't another put-on PHIL I mean it 's kind of poetic  --  you know ? BOBBY Poetry in motion . I also have a cassette . LARRY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , you guys BOBBY Larry 's got the devil in him tonight ! PHIL Did you say a cassette ? ( BOBBY nods , reaches behind couch , pulls out a cassette and inserts it in the VCR , punches it on . All wait for picture . ) ELLIOT I do n't think I can see this tonight . ( Starts to leave. ) p. 34 PHIL Give it a chance , Elliot ! What can you lose ? Give it a chance ! BOBBY ( turns off picture ) No . LARRY Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Bobby ! BOBBY This is Elliot 's privilege . He has veto rights . LARRY ( whines ) Elliot ! PHIL It does n't hurt to look , Elliot . Right ? ELLIOT I do n't want to spoil your party . Look , it 's a bad night for me . Now I 'm spoiling it again . I 'll just go . LARRY Come on , Elliot ! PHIL This is your party . ELLIOT There 's no reason my lousy mood should get in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not going to have a good time if you go home . BOBBY If he 's not in the mood  --  PHIL Hey , I can see this some other time . ELLIOT Look , another night there 's nothing I 'd rather watch . LARRY Jesus , Elliot , give us a break , for Pete 's sake ! ELLIOT You want to see it ? I 'm not stopping you . p. 35 LARRY You are stopping us . You always stop us . It never changes with you . You 've always been the one who holds back . BOBBY Lay off , Larry . PHIL Do n't be an asshole , Larry . LARRY I do n't believe for one fucking moment it 's your mood . I mean I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , all that crap , all the crap you 're going through . But I got ta be honest . I do n't think the day will come in our lifetime when you , Elliot , will want to see this film . BOBBY Lighten up . ELLIOT I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking . ELLIOT Why is it such a big deal ? BOBBY Hey , Larry , pour yourself a drink , man . Lighten up . ELLIOT I 'm sorry . I know I 'm wrong , but it does the opposite of what it 's supposed to . Normally I sit through it . But I ca n't tonight . I 'm sorry , I ca n't . I apologize . It embarrasses me . It brings out the lapsed Catholic in me . I wish I could get the kicks out of it you guys get . I envy you . I feel lousy about it . I do n't say I do n't like looking . Naked girls , yes as long as it 's erotic . But pictures of women sticking their fingers up their cunts . Dildos . Vibrators . Kiddie porn . I do n't like watching a blowjob on a TV set . In Vera 's house . I 'm bothered by it . I 'm bothered by it . I 'm an adult ; I know I 'm not supposed to be bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me tonight to do this for you . ( He runs out of words . Others stir uncomfortably . BOBBY puts the photos back in the envelope , takes the cassette out of the VCR , and hides it again behind the couch . Finally , PHIL grabs the business card and crosses to the phone . He dials . All look on as he wait's. ) p. 36 PHIL Hello . I 'd like to speak to  --  um  --  ( Checks card . ) Wrong number . ( PHIL hangs up , looks around helplessly . ELLIOT crosses , takes phone , reads card in PHIL 's hand , and dials . ) ELLIOT Francine ? Fredericka ! I hope I 'm not calling too late , my friends and I. My friends would like to make a date I do n't know , how many can you handle ? Well , no , we 're only four . And you 're two  --  right ? Do you think you can handle that ? Sounds good to me sounds good . Yes well , we saw your pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl oh , you 're the athletic one . Both of you ? Then this is our lucky night . You are ? Why , yes , sure , right now . BOBBY ( alarmed ) What are you saying , man ? ELLIOT Right , as good a time as any . Say , how much  --  um , how much do you , do you charge ? Well well ( To others : ) It 's five hundred for two hours . BOBBY Get off the goddamn phone , man ! PHIL Five hundred ? ( To LARRY : ) It 's a lot of money . p. 37 BOBBY Hang up ! Hang up ! LARRY Yes ! Yes ! Go for it ! BOBBY Goddammit ! PHIL Five hundred  --  I do n't know , Elliot . BOBBY What kind of shit is this ! LARRY ( to PHIL ) Shut up ! ( To ELLIOT : ) Absolutely ! You ca n't back down now . PHIL Can we call back in a minute ? BOBBY What are you trying to do , Elliot ? ELLIOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the thing the thing is , that kind of money is a little hard to come up with at this hour of the night . You understand ? No , we ca n't tomorrow no , tomorrow I 'm out of town . Say , would you consider , say , coming down a little ? Well , do n't make a snap decision ; ask your friend but I have to tell you what we have here  --  we 're emptying our wallets now  --  is , if we do n't include our cab fare home , three hundred dollars . Yeah well  --  well , I know . I know . I understand . I sure do . I sure do . Well , let me tell you , you wo n't be sorry . 440 East Ohio BOBBY You ca n't bring ' em here ! p. 38 ELLIOT Apartment 22G . BOBBY Hey , man ELLIOT Fifteen minutes ? Sounds great to me , Fredericka . I 'm sorry  --  Francine . ( Hangs up . ) BOBBY Call ' em back ! Call ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't ever want you to say I stop you . BOBBY Give me that goddamned card ! ( ELLIOT tears card into pieces , scatters pieces on floor . ) What the hell are you doing , man ? You ca n't invite two tramps to my home ! My home ! My wife lives here , man ! My wife and child ! The women will be back in another hour ! My boy 's going to be home any minute ! ELLIOT Then why did you show us the pictures , Bobby ? BOBBY Shit , what 's that got to do with it ? He asked me ! ( Indicates PHIL . ) PHIL I did n't ask you . ELLIOT You always do what Phil asks , Bobby ? PHIL Bullshit he does ! ELLIOT Is that what you 're telling me ? Why did you show us the business card ? BOBBY What is this  --  an interrogation ? p. 39 ELLIOT Why did you turn on the cassette , Bobby ? BOBBY Am I on trial ? Here ? In my own home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off in deference to you , buddy ! ELLIOT I 'm grateful . I 'm grateful . Why did you put us through this , Bobby ? BOBBY Put you through ? Put you through what , motherfucker ! ELLIOT You get a lot of pleasure out of it , do n't you ? Is n't that the case ? BOBBY I try to do a favor . Is this what I get ? ELLIOT Bobby , you are only trying to do one thing , and it 's the same thing you 've been trying to do since we were fourteen : you 're trying to make your friends feel stupid , your best friends . Is n't that what 's going on here ? If I buy a new watch , you tell me where you could 've gotten me a better deal . If I buy a stereo , you tell me what 's wrong with it ; the first thing , before I 've had a chance to take an hour 's pleasure , you tell me what a second-rate machine I 've got . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dated , it 's warped , if I 'd only talked to you . The deals you could have gotten me ! And when I do go to you for advice ? I do n't get a deal , I get a smoke screen . I get words ; I get so many ifs , ands , and buts , so much language , so much expertise , that I do n't know whether I 'm coming or going . But what I do n't get , what I do n't get is help . What I needed tonight was a little help . Larry , even Larry out there on the terrace , he tried to help . p. 40 LARRY Come on , Elliot , you know Bobby . ELLIOT Phil tried to help . Vera , your wife , tried to help . What are you doing ? These pictures and this this cassette in your wife 's house ! What are you doing ? What are you doing talking about family , the the the historic importance of family ! Get in line , he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fredericka ? Maybe Francine ? Am I going to march in line with Francine ? Why do you have to do this to me tonight ? All I wanted to do , all I wanted was to introduce my girl to my friends , my oldest friends . She was right all the time . She did n't want to know you . PHIL Come on , Elliot . ELLIOT I do n't want to know you either . BOBBY You do n't give a man a chance , do you , Elliot ? ELLIOT I 'll call the whores . I never intended for them to come . ( Picks up phone . ) PHIL You tore up the number ! ELLIOT I remember it . ( Dials phone . ) BOBBY Who are you to judge ? You 've always been the judge . PHIL ( to ELLIOT ) Well ? p. 41 ELLIOT ( listens ) It 's the answering machine for Bank of America . ( Hangs up , redials . ) BOBBY I 've got a functioning marriage : I 've got a fine wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What are you to tell me how to run my show ? ELLIOT A show  --  that 's all it is . You 're not sincere about anything . ( Hangs up . ) Wrong number . I thought I remembered it . ( BOBBY and LARRY scramble for pieces of the card . ) I thought I committed it to memory . BOBBY You 'll pay , motherfucker ! ELLIOT Oh , stop calling me " motherfucker " ! It 's too late to be black , Bobby . The only friends you have are white . LARRY Here it is . BOBBY Let me  --  PHIL 972-14  --  ( Doorbell chimes . All look alarmed . ) BOBBY I 'll kill you for this ! LARRY I 'll go . BOBBY This is my house . I will go . LARRY I 'll go with you . BOBBY Shut the fuck up ! Give me your money ! p. 42 LARRY Let 's take a look . I want to see what I 'm paying for . PHIL Larry 's right . Maybe it 's not the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , goddammit ! I 'm gon na pay the bitches off , and that 's the end of it now ! ( To ELLIOT : ) And I want you out of my house . And it ai n't gon na be my money . ELLIOT It should n't be your money . ( Takes out wallet . To others : ) I 'm sorry . ( Hands bills to BOBBY . ) It 's only a hundred fifty . ( BOBBY grabs the money and exit 's . ) PHIL Why do you say that , Elliot  --  you do n't want to know us ? We 're your friends ! LARRY Fuck him ! PHIL You said it yourself : you do n't have many friends . You know ? You 've got to keep the friends you have . LARRY Leave him alone . I painted his fucking apartment at cost ! PHIL I 've been on the wagon for three months . Sometimes you 're really mean . I would n't do that to ( All suddenly stare at the study door as JOANNA enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) JOANNA ( alarmed ) @x The scene is Bobby 's study , five minutes later . All eyes are on JOANNA , sitting in Bobby 's favorite chair . The others hover about , exhibiting small signs of nervousness . PHIL downs his Tab reflexively , jerkily . LARRY smirks at JOANNA across his bourbon glass . ELLIOT stands next to and a little behind her , warily , protectively . BOBBY is at the bar pouring a vodka and tonic . Throughout the scene , Bobby 's accent ranges from Southern drawl to mid-Atlantic to clipped neo-British . BOBBY Ice ? JOANNA Piece of cake . ( BOBBY mixes the drink amidst total silence . He serves JOANNA . ) BOBBY Girls should be back soon . JOANNA What was the movie ? ( ELLIOT and PHIL name movie simultaneously . In reaction , everyone takes a drink . ) I did n't mean to blunder into a stag party . ELLIOT ( quickly ) You missed a nice dinner , Joanna . JOANNA What did you have ? ( No one but BOBBY seems to remember. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOBBY ( as if tasting it ) Couscous . JOANNA Forgive my ignorance . What exactly  --  ? BOBBY Yeah , well , it 's a North African dish . It 's kind of a beef and chick-pea cereal . You understand ? JOANNA Mm-hmm . BOBBY You kind of throw everything in the pantry into a pot : squash , zucchini , tomato paste , garlic . And when it achieves the consistency of motor oil , you pour the works on a what-have-you semolina-bran sort of concoction . Cholesterol count off the charts ; guaranteed cardiac arrest . JOANNA Are you a cook , Bobby ? You seem to know so much about it . ELLIOT Bobby taught Vera how to cook . BOBBY No way . She is nonpareil . My specialty is extraterrestrial condo-size omelettes . ( BOBBY smiles at how well he 's going over . Pause . JOANNA sits still , quietly drinking , as the men shift around . JOANNA turns to LARRY . ) JOANNA Larry , right ? LARRY Yo . JOANNA Are n't you the one who drove your wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LARRY It was only a cliff . It suited the purpose . It did the job . Anytime you want anyone 's car driven off a cliff , I can give you tips . I 'm your man . JOANNA My former husband , he did n't care so much about cars , but his true passion was his tape deck . Had I known you then I might have hired you to drop that off a cliff . I ca n't count the times I 've thought of dropping it out a window . I guess I 'm too much of a wimp . PHIL You 're no wimp ! LARRY Phil , will you never shut up . ( PHIL looks away . LARRY grins at ELLIOT . ) You want to know what you 're letting yourself in for with this son of a bitch ? BOBBY Larry 's ready for bear , going to give you the real skinny . Oh , yeah . LARRY No . The lady has the right to know . He 's a pseudointellectual , your Elliot . I 'm telling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me were reading Marvel comics at St. George ( ELLIOT , BOBBY , and PHIL ad-lib groans : " Oh , no , " " Lord save me . " ) Give me a break here , guys , okay ? Your boyfriend here was reading J.D. Salinger , who was a god to him  --  and who else was God to him at that point in time ? Help me out , you guys . p. 46 PHIL Ernest Hemingway . BOBBY ( to PHIL ) Do n't encourage him . LARRY That 's right . That 's right . And not only that . Not only that . When he read the papers  --  okay , he turned to sports first . I admit he was a little normal . But after sports , after the comics  --  ELLIOT ( to JOANNA ) Forgive me . LARRY  --  the little bastard , the little show-off read the news columns ! BOBBY Hey , man , we all read the news except you , you illiterate bastard ! LARRY You read diddley ! This bullshitter ! Bobby is famous for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cornflakes boxes . BOBBY You must be tolerant . Larry is not comfortable with a woman outside the confines of a divorce court . LARRY Will ya listen to this bastard ! BOBBY Larry will not date a lady without an attorney present . LARRY ( grins ) The bastard 's talking about my personal life ! I 'm not gon na let him get away with it . I 'll tell you exactly what happened , Joanna . ( To BOBBY : ) I could talk about your personal life too , guy . ( BOBBY mock-shudders . ) So watch your tongue ! ( To JOANNA : ) He 's a great guy . Do n't get him wrong . p. 47 ELLIOT Say , Larry  --  LARRY Bobby would hide his light under a bushel , but he ca n't find one big enough . Huh ? ( Turns to ELLIOT but turns back to JOANNA before ELLIOT can speak . ) What are you drinking ? ( JOANNA offers up her empty glass . LARRY crosses to bar . ) JOANNA Vodka and tonic . LARRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for kitchen . ) Wait ! I 'll tell you the whole story . ( Exits . ) JOANNA ( to PHIL , fast , before there can be a pause ) It 's wonderful that you boys stayed fast friends . All these years . It 's very rare . PHIL You 're very different  --  I do n't mean anything wrong  --  from Elliot 's wife . ELLIOT ( warning ) Phil PHIL ( shrugs ) No offense . ( Falls into silence . ) JOANNA Oh , poo . ( To PHIL : ) I 'd like to hear . ( BOBBY snickers. ) p. 48 PHIL I mean , outside of looks . You look a little like her , but Marian was  --  she could say things  --  JOANNA That 's interesting . I look like her ? ELLIOT What is your problem , Phil ? PHIL  --  could cut through you like a knife . Not to say she was n't a smart girl . I 'd have to say she was  --  well  --  way beyond me . BOBBY ( cool ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at ease with us after five minutes than Marian after six years . She did n't approve of any of us . Bobby 's got a point . BOBBY ( confused , to ELLIOT ) What was my point ? PHIL Although my wife  --  my then-wife  --  I 'm separated  --  Ginger  --  and she 's not as brilliant as Marian , but she did n't approve of these guys either . Including Elliot . I 'm just saying  --  BOBBY Ginger may have been more brilliant than you think she was . PHIL Wives do n't like their husbands ' friends . Although Vera  --  BOBBY What they do n't like is anyone who knows their old man better than they do . p. 49 PHIL  --  Bobby 's wife , she 's not that way . Anyhow , if you know someone longer , it does n't mean you know him necessarily  --  BOBBY Anyway , it 's different , the way women know men . PHIL  --  better . The same man . You can take the same man and put him  --  BOBBY We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( laughs ) You 're not better behaved . I can swear to that . BOBBY We show our weak side to our wives . JOANNA You put on less of a show . I 'd agree with that . BOBBY We do n't have to . JOANNA After you 've got us . ( Laughs . ) BOBBY Riiight . After we gotcha , we want you to put on the show . JOANNA You do n't want to do a damn thing . That 's the truth of it . Oh , men , men . Lordy , lordy . LARRY ( enters from kitchen carrying two drinks ) Elliot ? ( ELLIOT crosses to LARRY , standing by kitchen door . Others continue talking . ) The whores . I just remembered . p. 50 ELLIOT ( shocked ) Shit ! LARRY Soon enough , old pal . What I 'm saying  --  I 'll head ' em off . In a couple of minutes I 'll make an excuse , I 'll excuse myself , and I 'll go down to the lobby and I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take care of it . ELLIOT What a jerk I am . LARRY You said it , not me . ELLIOT Thanks , Larry . LARRY No sweat . We 'll settle up later . ELLIOT Thanks , Larry . LARRY I 'll take care of it . Not another word . ( To JOANNA : ) Vodka and tonic . ( Brings her drink . Throughout the above , the following is intercut : ) PHIL Ginger was a lot like Marian , but they could n't stand each other . BOBBY Maybe that 's why . PHIL Ginger says anything that comes into her mind  --  it does n't matter who 's around  --  and she does n't give a damn . Ya know ? I mean I used to think she was a free spirit  --  am I boring you ?  --  but after a while  --  I should n't complain  --  it 's a little hard . p. 51 BOBBY You 're well out of it . LARRY ( after serving Joanna 's drink ) Who we talking about ? I 'll say she was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a lot . LARRY She drove you to drink . PHIL She had her good points . LARRY ( to JOANNA ) Say , how did you two meet ? ELLIOT You do n't really want to know . PHIL I do . JOANNA Be nice , Elliot . You boys are going to love this ! Where to begin ? Ronnie , my eldest , going on seven , was running a fever and complaining of a stomachache , and the one thing I am decidedly not is a calm , cool , and collected mother . I know it 's boring to hear me talk about my children , but  --  ( Smiles winningly . ) I am waiting for the doctor to return my call and  --  this is about seven in the evening and I have just gotten home and they never said a word at day care  --  they do n't give two ticks , those girls . Well-meaning but ignorant , ignorant , ignorant , and I am not a racist . But I am in a state , and the doctor has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuss the way they do when one is sick and receives all the attention  --  ( To LARRY : ) I promise this gets better . p. 52 LARRY No problem . ( Grins at her . ) JOANNA So of course , when the phone rings , I grab it on the assumption it must be the doctor , but not at all : it 's a young man doing a survey , and I am as polite as I am able to be under the circumstances , but I ask him courteously to get off the phone , please , because I am with a sick child and I am keeping the line open for the doctor . And the young man says , " I appreciate that , but this will take only a moment of your time . I 'm going to list three leading beverages , and I wonder if you could tell me which you 'd be most likely to drink between the hours of eight and eleven , eleven and two , two and five  --  " So I asked to speak to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livid , but the one thing that makes me livid is people who know you are under duress but they have their agenda and , by God , they are going to stick to it . So I ask  --  I demand  --  the name of his superior , and I wo n't bore you with how long that took or what he said , the little weasel , or what I said in reply . But shameful as it is to say , in the time spent on that , the doctor might have been calling and calling and calling . I 'd never know . But I have lost interest in my ailing calf . I want this man 's job ! And when I finally am put in contact with his superior , why , it 's Elliot ! And I explain to him as he comes on the phone that I ca n't talk to him now , but if I could have his name and telephone number , he has a young man in his employ that I would like him to fire . And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be pleased to fire anyone you want me to ; I will be waiting for your call , Mrs. Ross . " Now was n't that the most charming thing to say ? p. 53 PHIL Did he fire him ? JOANNA He did not . He lied . This man , your friend , lied to me . Can you believe he would do that to me ? LARRY Can I get you another drink , Joanna ? JOANNA I believe the man is trying to get me drunk . ( Reaches over and touches Elliot 's arm affectionately . ) I did n't know him the way I know him now . He 's too kind to fire anybody . ELLIOT I fire people . JOANNA Poo you have ! LARRY Did they know they were fired after you fired them ? ELLIOT I do n't throw them bodily out of the office . LARRY You tell them you think they 'd be happier elsewhere . ELLIOT I tell them  --  LARRY ( interrupts ) " This hurts me more than it hurts you . " JOANNA Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly touching him . LARRY grins . ) ELLIOT  --  just that it 's not working out , that I 'm sorry it 's not working out , and if they want to talk about it I 'd be happy to do that , but if they prefer not , that 's fine too . p. 54 LARRY You 're too goddamn nice ! ( ELLIOT shrugs . ) Somebody you fire , it probably takes a month before he knows you 've fired him . When I fire an employee it 's because they 're incompetent , and incompetence puts me in a rage . JOANNA You too ? Me too ! LARRY In a rage ! JOANNA Especially my own . I ca n't stand my own . BOBBY You ca n't stand incompetence ? You are living in the wrong age . JOANNA It does seem to be everywhere , does n't it ? BOBBY I am competent . I am an extremely competent man . But at the magazine I dare not show it . JOANNA Where do you work , Bobby ? I should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOANNA Playboy . LARRY Now we 're talking incompetence . BOBBY If you expose your competence  --  overly expose your competence  --  to colleagues who are less competent than they perceive you to be , they will react badly . They will react in a hostile manner . You understand what I am saying ? p. 55 JOANNA It 's everywhere , kind of , is n't it ? BOBBY It 's a threat . JOANNA Competence is a threat . BOBBY Precisely . JOANNA Because you overshadow them . I mean  --  BOBBY If you are the best in a situation where they know it and you know it but they are afraid of it , they reject it . So be it . Understand ? LARRY Right . Fuck it ! My man , Bobby . PHIL Come on  --  watch your language , Larry . ( To JOANNA : ) I 'm sorry . JOANNA ( to PHIL ) I like to hear men curse . Although the language my children already use ! LARRY It 's women cursing that gets me . BOBBY Larry 's old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one good thing about Ginger  --  LARRY ( grins at ELLIOT ) Marian could say " fuck " more naturally than Elliot . Elliot 's a bit of a prude . But I guess you know that . Marian Fogarty could dish it out with the best of them . PHIL And then switch to the most highfalutin  --  p. 56 BOBBY Jesus , I almost forgot that ! LARRY This movie is Felliniesque , and that movie is Bergmanesque . She could have been a critic . ( All the men but ELLIOT laugh . ELLIOT looks anxiously at JOANNA . ) JOANNA I love profanity . It 's so  --  I think it can be poetic the way men use it . I 'm not at ease when it 's used by women as much . Are you ? But did you see this play that was in Chicago a couple of years ago ? These real estate salesmen ? Glen  --  Glen something ? Impossible title ! My , the way they jawed at each other . I 'm in real estate and that 's not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license . LARRY I see movies  --  mainly videotapes . Believe it , nothing Felliniesque . There 's no theater worth seeing in Chicago . BOBBY Look who 's the authority . ( Shakes his head sagely . ) JOANNA Are you a theater buff , Bobby ? Elliot wo n't ever take me . ELLIOT You never told me you wanted to go . BOBBY You see Fences ? JOANNA I did indeed . When it played here . Remarkable , if you want my opinion . Remarkable . p. 57 ELLIOT Of course I 'll take you to the theater . BOBBY That was my story . JOANNA No . BOBBY My story . My father was that father . I 'm different from the son , but that was my father . Except he was n't a good ballplayer . But pride . Fucked-up , stupid , jive-assed pride . Male profanity . JOANNA Just lovely . BOBBY My father died at forty-two , which is my next birthday . From the time I was fourteen , I was bigger and stronger and better coordinated than my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father was the original butterball . Mr. Five-by-Five . Loved to throw that ball . Did he ever ! And moved pretty good for a man his girth . He had these dainty little feet , goddamnedest feet ! My mother 's feet were bigger . Toes the size of cucumbers . An ox , my mother . But my father , you understand , he had a good arm on him . And he could rifle a throw in from right field , nail a man turning third , never make it home . I saw him do it more than once . But he could n't get around on a fastball . This particular Sunday  --  did I say I 'm fourteen ?  --  I struck him out twice . Fathers-and-sons game . Hyde Park , you understand , and I was a big kid . Oh , was I ! On my mother 's side they 're all six feet and over . But I worshipped the man . Like in Fences . Father and son . Like in Bambi . Where the stags fight . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has trouble meeting my eye . I 'm fourteen years old and I do n't weigh a hundred and thirty , and two strikeouts later I 'm king of the stags . My father abdicates . Everybody struck the old fool out ! It was never the same . p. 58 JOANNA And he died shortly thereafter . BOBBY ( after a pause ) Nooo . ( Pause . ) It would have made a better story , would n't it ? ( Smiles at JOANNA . ) Eight years later . I 'm sorry . He died eight years later . Another ? ( Takes her glass . ) JOANNA You 're in AA , Phil ? LARRY ( before PHIL can answer ) I was gon na tell you about my wife . These guys thought they knew her . ( Shakes his head . ) I got ta tell you : twenty-one days PMS . ( Throughout his speech , LARRY can not look at JOANNA . ) " What 's the matter with your hair , Larry ? " " You smell funny . " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter with my hair . It 's my hair , all right ? ! The hair she was sleeping with , stroking . Every night for three years . That 's my hair . The same fucking hair . You better believe it , it 's hilarious . But the minuses are the minuses , and when the pluses outweigh the minuses , " What 's the matter with your hair ? " is a joke ; and when the minuses outweigh the pluses , it 's a good reason to drive the bitch 's car off a cliff . ( An embarrassed silence . ) ELLIOT Larry , did n't you have somewhere to go ? p. 59 LARRY ( looks at his watch , swills down his drink ) Now I 'll tell you about my father . I had a father too . ( Addresses JOANNA : ) My father did n't talk . Maybe he talked to my sisters . They got along fine . But he could n't talk to me . Son of a bitch . A tenant in the house , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paid my mother rent . He was good with small talk , that he could do . Courteous . Genial . He could tell he knew me from somewhere ; he just could n't fit my face with a name . He called me by my sisters ' names . I grew up believing  --  hoping  --  he was n't my real father . Maybe I was adopted , it was my only hope . A mistake in the hospital . PHIL Your father was a great guy  --  what are you talking about ? ( LARRY shrugs , goes to pour himself a drink . ) ELLIOT Now I guess we have to hear about your father , Phil . Larry , it 's getting late . ( LARRY returns with a drink , does n't answer . ) Did n't you have somewhere to go ? LARRY ( looks at his watch ) Couple of minutes . This is fun . I like your girl , El . I could never talk to my wife . ( He moves close to JOANNA . JOANNA smoothly turns to PHIL. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phil . I wish I could give it up . PHIL You have to do it one day at a time . JOANNA I ca n't do anything one day at a time . PHIL You do n't need it . Nobody needs it . LARRY I need it . BOBBY ( nods ) Heaven help us . PHIL It 's an addiction . ELLIOT Joanna is not an alcoholic . This is getting depressing . PHIL It 's drinking that depresses you , Elliot . ELLIOT The talking , Phil , the talking about drinking depresses me . JOANNA ( to ELLIOT ) Do n't let it get to you . PHIL I 'm not being holier than thou . ELLIOT Give it a rest , all right ? PHIL I 'm not , Elliot . Say I 'm not . ELLIOT Is n't it good enough that you 've stopped ? Joanna does n't have a drinking problem . PHIL You do n't ? JOANNA I could have . p. 61 PHIL I thought you had a drinking problem . JOANNA I have what you might call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do drink . PHIL Well , there you are . ( To ELLIOT : ) Elliot ? JOANNA Well , it 's true I do n't  --  too much . That 's certainly true . I have very little capacity . PHIL So you stopped . JOANNA But I wish I did n't have to . I hate women drunks  --  and that , I believe , is what stops me . Women drunks are unattractive . And you men , you men can get away with it . BOBBY The lady has drinking envy . JOANNA That 's very clever of you , Bobby . BOBBY That 's what you 've got , drinking envy . JOANNA I would like to be able to get away with drinking like a man . PHIL No , you would n't . And I 'm not being holier than thou when I say that . ( To ELLIOT : ) I 'm not , Elliot . You know me . JOANNA Oh , poo , Elliot . Phil is not being holier than thou . PHIL You do n't know me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62 JOANNA I 'd just bet on it . ELLIOT I did n't say you were being holier than thou  --  LARRY Yes , you did . ELLIOT What I meant  --  LARRY ( with sarcasm ) Oh , now he 's going to tell us what he meant ! Deep , the man 's deep . ELLIOT You talk too damn much about not drinking . PHIL I did n't bring it up . ELLIOT Whoever brings it up , you do talk about it , Phil . Come on  --  you know it and Larry knows it and Bobby knows it . BOBBY Do n't tell me what I know , man ! I do n't know it . ELLIOT ( glares at him ) Good . I do n't know it either . JOANNA ( to ELLIOT ) Now you be nice . LARRY None of us knows it . ( Finishes drink . ) JOANNA ( to ELLIOT ) Do n't let it get to you . LARRY I take it one day at a time . ( Pours himself another drink. ) p. 63 BOBBY Hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you take a drink . Then the drink takes a drink . Then the drink takes you . " PHIL That 's right . That 's true . Fitzgerald said that ? JOANNA I believe so . PHIL That 's very good , you know ? " First , you take a drink . Then the drink takes a drink . Then the drink takes you . " That 's what happens , you know ? Exactly what happens . ( Nods vigorously . ) That 's exactly what happens . JOANNA It must take great strength of character . ( Pause . ) I am so weak-willed . ( Pause . ) Elliot knows how weak-willed I am . ELLIOT Goddammit ! You 're not weak-willed , Joanna , you 're about the strongest woman I know ! JOANNA Listen to the man rave . I am so weak-willed I can not resist a sale . ( Pause . ) BOBBY ( beams paternally at JOANNA ) Capitalism , my dear . We live in a society that forbids us to resist a sale . We are so programmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ! p. 64 JOANNA Oh , I bet you can resist anything you put your mind to , Bobby . BOBBY I am not of this system . I 'm of another system . I dip into this system and use it however it suits me . I 've trained myself to do just that . You understand what I 'm saying ? ELLIOT Larry , are you going downstairs or not ? You said you were going . LARRY What 's the hurry ? ( ELLIOT crosses to bar and pours a stiff drink . He holds it out to PHIL . ) ELLIOT Do us all a favor , Phil . You used to be a great guy . Nobody can stand you anymore . ( All freeze , ELLIOT with a drink held out to PHIL , who looks stunned . Finally LARRY crosses to ELLIOT , takes the drink , and downs it . ) LARRY ( to JOANNA ) Nice meeting you . You spend your lifetime looking for a woman . There comes a time  --  I 'm getting ready . ( He crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable-ready VCR . I got games racked up on tape : the whole Laker-Celtic series , Super Bowl XI , every Muhammed Ali fight going back to Liston , Hagler-Leonard , Leonard-Duran . I got Pal Joey , Magnum Force , The Good , the Bad and the Ugly . I got more than seven hundred hours on tape . The times I spend with a woman  --  what 's it come to , the times awake ? Five , six hours a night , and weekends . Half of it hassle . The VCR is better . A chicken-and-pasta takeout . I open a brew , I rack up the VCR . No regrets , no recriminations , no consequences . My companion . p. 65 BLACKOUT p. 66 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 Time : later that night , four a.m . Dark stage . The telephone rings five times with increasing loudness . Lights up , stage right , Elliot 's living room . ELLIOT is sprawled in a beat-up armchair . That , plus a side table with a telephone and a floor lamp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time magazine lie crumpled at his feet . His jacket , tie , and shoes are off . A half-empty bottle of Scotch sit 's on the side table next to a watery ice tray . A Scotch glass rests on the arm of the chair . ELLIOT has been lying , passed out , in the chair for about an hour . He stares angrily at the phone , deciding whether to answer , and when he does , his voice is hoarse with sleep and booze . ELLIOT I do n't think there 's anything left for us to say . ( Lights up , stage left , Joanna 's kitchen . JOANNA sits on a high stool next to a white wall phone . She wears a nightgown and robe , and is barefoot . A pot of coffee sits on a table nearby . She holds a mug in her hand , which she sips at . She will refill the mug throughout the scene until the pot is empty . ) JOANNA Surely we can talk . We 're adults . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says nothing . Long pause . ) Can you come over ? ( Pause . ) Are you there ? p. 67 ELLIOT No . JOANNA No , you 're not there ? ELLIOT No , I ca n't come over . JOANNA I think what you 're doing is very hurtful to both of us , Elliot . ELLIOT Okay . ( Pause . ) You come over here . JOANNA I 've got the children . How can I ? ELLIOT ( icy ) I 'd say you 've got a problem . JOANNA I 've never heard you so mean . ELLIOT If that 's what you called for , to call me names , if that 's it  --  JOANNA Please  --  ELLIOT I 'm going to hang up this phone . JOANNA Elliot , what is happening here ? We 've got to talk ! ELLIOT Why ? JOANNA Do n't you think so ? ELLIOT Not really . JOANNA What have I missed ? Did I do something ? I do n't know what you think I did , Elliot . ELLIOT I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be explained away , Joanna  --  p. 68 JOANNA Very little happened tonight , as far as I can tell . I met your friends . I liked them . ( Pause . ) Is there nothing you want to say to me ? ( Pause . ) Elliot ? ELLIOT You 're the one who called . ( A long pause . JOANNA wait 's for more . ELLIOT says nothing . He puts down the phone , exits , reenters with a full ice tray , puts ice in his glass , and pours a Scotch . He sips it and makes a sour face . He glares at the phone and picks it up . Throughout the above , JOANNA does n't move except for occasional sips of coffee . She is listening hard . ) The worst part what I can not get over what I can not forgive is Phil . JOANNA I liked Phil . I really do n't understand what you are trying to do here . ELLIOT You patronized Phil . Phil is an unstable guy , Joanna , who has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet , and he would never dream of speaking a word he does n't mean which is why he has trouble getting words out , because unlike you , he wants to be certain he means them . ( Goes into a coughing fit . ) You came onto Phil as if you were an alcoholic  --  JOANNA Are you all right ? ( No response . ) I did no such thing . p. 69 ELLIOT As a drunk , then . JOANNA I do drink . ELLIOT You do n't drink , Joanna . Not the way Phil means it . But you made it sound as if you were colleagues in AA , peer drunks , you and Phil . " A small , ungifted drinking problem . " My God ! " I wish I could get drunk like you big bad men do , but women drunks are so unattractive . " Jesus Christ ! JOANNA He liked me ! ELLIOT They all liked you . They fell for you like a ton of bricks . Even Larry , who hates women . " Incompetence puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about  --  about how I ca n't fire people , talking about what a wimp I am , Joanna ! I do n't put up with incompetent employees ! Why do you put me in a position where I have to defend myself ? Not with my friends ! But do you take my side ? Is there a shred of loyalty ? You see the opening to  --  to get on Larry 's side and you dive right in . You plough right in . " How true . How true . Incompetence puts me in a rage too . " For Christ 's sake ! For Christ 's sake ! JOANNA You must be out of your mind . ELLIOT You see ? I could have predicted this . You wanted me to talk . I 'm talking . But you do n't want to hear it , so I 'm out of my mind . What 's the use ? JOANNA Do n't get upset . p. 70 ELLIOT Do n't say that ! ( Pause . ) JOANNA All the way home in the taxi , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this . Rather , the abuse of your moroseness . Silence . Your deep , penetrating , opaque , manly gloom . I pay off the sitter and you follow her out the door . Within seconds after she 's gone , you are gone . No argument . No explanation . I have the right to expect a sentence or two . I expect  --  however stumbling , stammering , what have you  --  I expect reasons ! ELLIOT ( furious ) I do not stammer , Joanna . You are confusing me with other men in your life . Other men who you no doubt seduced the way you seduced my friends tonight . ( Mock Southern syrupy . ) " My former husband , Jo Bob , now he did n't care beans about cars  --  y'heah ? His truly great passion was his tape deck . I would have gladly hired you to drop his tape deck off a cliff . " ( JOANNA hangs up . ) Bitch ! ( He quickly dials the phone JOANNA picks up before the first ring is complete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife , Ginger . Maybe you need a little context here , although God knows I do n't know if anything will help JOANNA I will listen . Please try to stay calm . p. 71 ELLIOT Try not to say you 're listening when you 're talking and not listening . Try to be honest if you can be honest . I do n't know if  --  JOANNA I 'm about to hang up again . ELLIOT It has always driven me crazy , these phrases of yours  --  JOANNA Now it comes out ELLIOT These phrases : " do n't let it get to you , " " do n't get upset . " And worst of all worst of all when you said " piece of cake " tonight not three minutes after you were in the room with my friends . You want to know something ? Something truly riotous ? I wanted to die at that moment . I literally cringed . Literally cringed . I felt stripped naked . I knew at that moment , with that first " piece of cake , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOANNA No one but you thinks it was a disaster . No one but you had a bad time . ELLIOT A bad time ? I had one of the classic bad times of the century ! I had not one bad time but two very different interweaving bad times . First , seeing my friends make asses of themselves over you  --  they could n't help themselves  --  JOANNA It was an awkward situation , I was trying to help . You did n't help . ELLIOT  --  and second second , seeing how you really are with men . Alone I never saw it . Too close . Too close . But it was like a laboratory , seeing you work , seeing you teasing and manipulating like mice , rodents , lab animals . These poor  --  Ginger , Before you hang up again  --  and do n't think I 'm calling you back  --  you hang up this time , that 's it for life , sister . Believe it ! Ginger was Larry 's girl . Then she was Bobby 's . They used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big joke . And Phil , Phil fell in love with every girl they discarded . Just about . Phil believes all women come from another and better planet , and the ones who slept with Larry and Bobby attain the status  --  I do n't know  --  something like First Lady . Jackie Onassis . God , the way Phil looked at you . The way he looked at you . Okay . Are you there ? p. 72 JOANNA I suppose I am . ELLIOT She was never very steady . I liked her all right . I nearly took her out . Ginger , I mean . After Bobby , before Larry . I wo n't go out with a girl after Larry 's through with her . Larry and I have this thing  --  Where was I ? You there ? Anyhow , Ginger is a big , strapping girl , and Phil , who 's easygoing enough  --  you can see that  --  is always after her was always after her to keep her weight in line , or at least stay in shape , exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her to do . Isometrics . Yoga . Whatever . And he 's really on her case . For Phil , that is , who really ca n't get on anyone 's case . But to the extent that he 's able to be forceful  --  Anyhow , she does it , signs up for a yoga class . And the day his mother goes to the hospital with cancer , Phil calls up Ginger  --  they do n't even know what it is at the time , but an ambulance took her so you ca n't say Joanna did n't know it was important  --  I mean Ginger . Ginger knew it was important but she said , " I have to go to my yoga class . " And Phil is on the phone to her , this whole thing happens on the telephone . He says , " But my mother 's in the hospital . " And Ginger says , " You 're the one who wanted me to get in shape , and now I signed up and you do n't want me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause . ) Make up your mind , Phil . Make up your mind , Phil . And would n't you know it ? He ended up convinced it was his fault . p. 73 JOANNA I do n't know why it is you 're telling this story . ELLIOT Just to show you . That 's the kind of guy he is . That 's all . That 's what he is , and you should n't have  --  I 'm not suggesting that Ginger made him an alcoholic . He comes from a family of heavy drinkers . But ( Trails off . ) JOANNA I was n't the one who offered him a drink . ( ELLIOT gasps . ) I was n't the one who tried to force  --  actually challenge  --  my alcoholic friend to take a drink , Elliot . That was n't me . ELLIOT It was you . JOANNA No , it was you . ELLIOT It was everything you did that led up to it . JOANNA It was n't me . ELLIOT You ca n't take it out of context . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what Ginger did . There 's a context JOANNA Maybe there was a context for Ginger refusing to go to the hospital  --  ELLIOT What , a yoga class ? ! What kind of context is that ? Do n't defend her just because you did something tonight  --  p. 74 JOANNA Maybe there was something between Ginger and Phil 's mother . Or between themselves . Do n't try to judge what married people do to each other , Elliot . The reasons are never clear . It 's never clear what goes on between two people . They do n't even have to be married . Look at us . What is our context ? I do n't know . Do you know ? I do n't know why I 'm on one end of the phone and you 're on the other end having a farewell fight with me when we both expected to be here at this hour together in bed . ELLIOT I never felt right about that . JOANNA This is not my idea . ELLIOT You insist on misunderstanding everything I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together under the same roof as your kids . That does n't bother you ? JOANNA Elliot , I do n't intend to sit here passively  --  ELLIOT It does n't even bother you , the morality of it ? They hear everything that goes on . JOANNA No , they do n't , and I 'll tell you why : they are children . They are asleep . They sleep through garbage trucks and warbling ambulances and low-flying jets . ELLIOT It 's wrong , goddammit ! JOANNA What am I supposed to do  --  farm them out ? I have nowhere to send them . p. 75 ELLIOT Your parents . JOANNA You want me to send my babies away to my parents so that you can fuck me with a clear conscience ? Is that what this argument is really about ? ELLIOT I do n't believe this ! It 's about  --  I 'll tell you what it 's about . Your cavalier screw-it-all attitude that services your needs moment by moment  --  and you have all the charm in the world to get away with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has on others . JOANNA You are uncomfortable with sex , Elliot . ( He hangs up and sits there . She finishes her coffee , pulls a bottle of gin from under the counter and pours a healthy shot , takes a snort , and dials the phone . ELLIOT picks up . ) You are uncomfortable with sex , Elliot . You know it and I know it . Though we have never talked about it . ELLIOT I 'm uncomfortable with hypocrisy , not sex . I do n't like living in the kind of world where in order to take my pleasure  --  Do n't tell me they do n't sense something . JOANNA That is my business , not yours . They like you , Elliot . They admire you . They talk about you . They 're always asking me questions about you . ELLIOT When my sister brought boys home , I heard everything . p. 76 JOANNA They are not being injured . I would not allow it . ELLIOT If you feel more comfortable thinking that  --  JOANNA You have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable . You worry about everything and I worry about you worrying . ELLIOT The hell you do ! JOANNA Just because I do n't make a show of it . You put on enough show . All that heartfelt concern of yours . All that sensitivity . Do n't talk to me about thoughtfulness . You vacuum up all the thoughtfulness in the room . You leave nothing for others . You 're anticipating , always anticipating , questioning , pre-planning . You do n't have a spontaneous bone in that tight- , tight- , tightassed , disapproving , harsh , judgmental body . ( Pause . ) ELLIOT I am judgmental . I know that . JOANNA All right then . So am I. ELLIOT No , you 're not . JOANNA No one on God 's green earth is as judgmental as you are . But believe me , that notwithstanding , I am judgmental , Elliot . I have passed a thousand judgments on you . ( Pause . ) ELLIOT You do n't think it 's wrong what we 're doing to your children ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be with children without being wrong . You ca n't be with people without making one bonehead mistake after another . So you pick up . That 's all life is : picking up after . Picking up . ELLIOT I do n't agree with that . JOANNA You do n't have children . You do n't make mistakes . You do n't get tied up in knots with other people . ELLIOT I got tied up with you . JOANNA And now you 've found a way of getting untied . ELLIOT That 's not what 's happening . JOANNA No ? Then what is ? Tell me . ( Pause . ) ELLIOT I 'm not sure anymore . I was sure before . I 'm not so sure . ( Pause . ) Joanna , I do n't really think I can be in the wrong about this . ( Pause . ) JOANNA I 'm still here . ELLIOT What did you mean by that ? JOANNA Only that I 'm listening . ELLIOT Do n't do that . I meant  --  you know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand times . p. 78 JOANNA I have passed judgment . Unlike you , I have not passed sentence . ELLIOT I see . You 've been magnanimous with me . I 've been small-minded , but you 're  --  Joanna 's magnamanamous . JOANNA ( cool ) Magnanimous . ELLIOT ( heatedly ) I know the word . What makes you so goddamn superior ! Where do you get off ! How dare you condescend to me ! JOANNA I never condescend to you . ELLIOT Yes , you do . JOANNA I did n't condescend to you tonight  --  ELLIOT To the others . I 'm not talking about me tonight . Other times  --  JOANNA I condescended to you . ELLIOT You know it ! JOANNA When have I done that , Elliot ? ELLIOT Right this minute . Right this minute ! Listen , if you could hear the sound of your own voice . JOANNA I am defending myself with this voice . You are attacking me , and I am defending myself . But when I am not defending myself , tell me one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  p. 79 ELLIOT You want names and dates ? JOANNA Because it is not true . I have respected you . ELLIOT Passed judgment ! You said it yourself . JOANNA So do you ! ELLIOT Not on you . JOANNA But you ca n't stand it when I say " piece of cake . " ELLIOT Big deal . JOANNA It makes you feel stripped naked . ELLIOT Tonight . Only tonight . Again , you 're screwing around with context . JOANNA Other times it does n't bother you . ELLIOT It always bothers me . But there 's a difference between bothering me and stripping me naked . JOANNA Why does it bother you ? ELLIOT Because  --  because  --  You 're a smart girl . Do I really have to explain ? JOANNA I 'm afraid that you really do . ELLIOT Because it 's thoughtless . JOANNA Mean old me . ELLIOT It 's  --  it 's automatic pilot . When you say it to me  --  or those other things , those other things you say  --  it 's not addressed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 JOANNA I see . I make you feel anonymous . ELLIOT At those times , yes . JOANNA But not at other times . ELLIOT At other times at other times ( Breaks into sobs . ) No one ever made me feel the way you do . ( Struggles for control . ) JOANNA ( losing control ) Elliot ELLIOT I 'm all right Joanna . JOANNA Shall I tell you how I feel ? I feel as if I 've been mugged . ELLIOT I never cared for anyone the way I care for you , and you mind it . You think I 'm a fussbudget . You see , we get it all wrong with each other . JOANNA I did n't say that . ELLIOT But that 's the way it comes out . I think I 'm doing one thing . I think I 'm being considerate , and you do n't see it as considerate . You see it as a vacuum cleaner . JOANNA No ELLIOT I vacuum-clean up all the emotions . And when you say it I can see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right . That 's exactly what I do . But that 's not  --  I thought , I thought I was doing something else . When you think you 're doing something right , and it 's wrong  --  When you think  --  when you set out to deliberately please someone , and the very act is a turn-off  --  p. 81 JOANNA It 's not that drastic . ELLIOT How can that gap be bridged ? There 's a gap . A gap , Joanna . And I  --  what I do  --  I guess  --  I try to bridge it , and I make it wider . I only wanted you to like me . It was important for me to have you care for me . JOANNA Do n't you know that I do ? ELLIOT I wanted to be special in your life , but everything I did  --  JOANNA It does n't matter . ELLIOT It 's the only thing that does matter . Whether people narrow the gap or widen it  --  is n't that what decides whether they should be together ? JOANNA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing , Elliot . ELLIOT There have to be . JOANNA Well then , the rules do n't work . ELLIOT There has to be something . Or else how do we know ? JOANNA I do n't know . Talking can help . We 've never discussed these things before . ELLIOT Talking ca n't help . JOANNA Maybe it can help . ELLIOT I 'm a polltaker , Joanna . I talk to people all the time . None of it is real . And you 're in real estate . p. 82 JOANNA You thought I was doing that to your friends tonight . Selling them . Setting them up . ELLIOT Setting them up . JOANNA That 's what made you so upset . ELLIOT ( heatedly ) Not upset ! JOANNA ( quickly ) Mad . Mad . ELLIOT I know you did n't like them . JOANNA I did like them . ELLIOT That 's more talk . Listen , I 've got to tell you I would n't like them either if I had n't grown up with them . But what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the way you were with them  --  so winning , so charming , so incredibly interested in what they 're saying , as if whoever it is you 're talking to , he 's the only person who exists in the world . Larger than life , Joanna . That 's the way you are with me . And I could see it was  --  there 's no other way of saying it  --  a game to you . What was I supposed to think ? JOANNA You think I tricked you ? ELLIOT I think  --  What am I supposed to think ? JOANNA That I do n't mean a word I say . ELLIOT You tricked me . I thought  --  this is what I thought  --  that you felt  --  a certain way about me  --  this is humiliating  --  and it turns out to be  --  technique . You turn it on  --  p. 83 JOANNA I 'm a phony . ELLIOT Are you ? JOANNA If you have to ask . Maybe it is too wide a gap . I ca n't ask you some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask what a relationship costs , young man , you ca n't afford one . I 'm not the way you are , Elliot . I assume certain things . I do n't relentlessly examine my assumptions . I assume if we 're together for six weeks , there 's a good reason for that . No ? I do make judgments , granted . So do you . But that does n't turn a good reason into a bad reason . I do n't know . Or does it ? ELLIOT I do n't know . JOANNA Well , I do n't know either . So talking does n't help . We 've pretty well dispensed with that illusion . What helps , Elliot ? ( Silence . ) Anything ? Anything at all ? ( Silence . ) I do n't know what there is left to do . We do understand things differently . We do miss connections . I 'm sure that 's true . You do with me all the time . I was arrogant enough to think I did n't with you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of me . But my effect is not calculated . What you call a " technique . " It 's not a technique . I have four brothers whom I never mentioned and with whom I 'm not in contact . I loved them passionately as a child . I have no addresses for them and I worry , what if I die , how will they know ? And that 's my only reason for resuming contact : so that they will be informed when I die . I have arranged a life that belongs to no one . I am not home , Elliot . You asked me about my children and our having sex in the next room . I think they do n't hear . I 'm sure they do n't hear . But until you asked , the question never occurred to me . I live in this state  --  I do n't know how to describe it , guilt is a step up from where I am now  --  a state of moral absenteeism . I want no encumbrances . I 'm on loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for me to run away from . I have two close friends whom you will never meet , Fay and Walter . They adore me and I adore them , and we are intimates and they know nothing about me . I chose to like you because I thought  --  this is cruel  --  I thought you were safe . p. 84 ELLIOT I 'm safe all right . JOANNA I thought I could keep you in bounds . I used to think it was a love of freedom that motivated my bad judgments . ELLIOT Am I a bad judgment ? JOANNA You are right to be angry . I am better with your friends than I am with you . I am at my most devastating with strangers . It used to vex and astonish me how much better my mother was with my friends than with her own children . No , Elliot , my bad judgment was that I could contain you . ELLIOT Joanna JOANNA I did n't dislike your friends . I liked them better than my friends . Phil and Bobby , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they look up to you so . ELLIOT That 's crazy . JOANNA Of course , to you . It made me proud . ELLIOT What I did to Phil is unforgivable . JOANNA He understands . ELLIOT Unforgivable . It was the worst single thing I have ever done in my life . How can he understand ? JOANNA You 'll call him . ELLIOT How can I call him ? How can I speak to any of them ever again ? p. 85 JOANNA You were under great stress ELLIOT That 's no excuse . There is no excuse . It 's a betrayal of every principle  --  JOANNA You ca n't always be in control  --  ELLIOT Is that what it amounts to ? And when I 'm not in control I 'm a worse asshole than the rest of them ? JOANNA You will call him , Elliot , and you will apologize . And he will be grateful for your call . He adores you , that man . ELLIOT You 're a much better person than I am . JOANNA Lordy  --  ELLIOT I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , to myself . I 'm not like you . I 'm a failure . JOANNA No , you 're not ! ELLIOT I do n't even care anymore . Much more was expected of me . JOANNA My mother still talks about how it 's not too late for me to go to law school . All my friends think I 'm throwing my life away . ELLIOT You never told me that . JOANNA Uh-huh . p. 86 ELLIOT I 've done better than my father , as a matter of fact . How come we 've never had this conversation before ? JOANNA We have . ELLIOT Have we ? When I go home , my father has trouble looking at me . My voice cracks when I go home . JOANNA Do it for me . ELLIOT What ? JOANNA Crack your voice like when you 're at your father 's . ELLIOT I ca n't . ( Pause . ) Hi , Mom . Hi ( voice cracks ) , Dad . ( JOANNA screams with laughter . ELLIOT starts to laugh . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so sorry . JOANNA Stop that ! ELLIOT I 'm a lousy lover . JOANNA I did n't say that . I do n't think that . ELLIOT I 've never  --  I do n't understand sex . It scares me , after all these years . It does n't scare you . JOANNA I 'm scared for you . So much is going on inside that head of yours . ELLIOT When we 're in bed . JOANNA **26;3060;TOOLONG , the drums and the horns and  --  I ca n't help but say it  --  p. 87 ELLIOT What ? JOANNA The bugle call of retreat . ELLIOT You know so much more than I thought you knew . The pleasure in my life comes from committing acts I 'm morally opposed to . I 'm a prude . Everything that makes me happy is in absolute defiance of my own standards . JOANNA You have strong values . ELLIOT I do n't have values , I have sentiments . Values are things you act on . If there 's a price to pay , you pay it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . You talk it up , you sound impressive , but before matters get messy , I 'm out of there . JOANNA It 's so hard , is n't it ? ELLIOT Maybe talk helps . JOANNA Elliot , the reason you hate those words I say  --  " do n't let it get to you , " " do n't get upset " ? They are warnings , those words . " Piece of cake " means " keep your distance , thank you kindly . " I have a secret life , Elliot , that I do n't know the secret to , but I do know it is there and I 'm not telling . Your thoughtfulness , Elliot . What I was attacking was that your thoughtfulness confounds me . It terrifies me because I wonder , what does this man want from me ? What in the world does he want from me ? Stop knocking at my door ! No one is home . You stop knocking at my door  --  all right ? And if you do , I will stop saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Can we shake on that ? ( Pause. )
