But when I look at this picture , I must not forget that Honore Daumier was first and foremost a caricaturist , although it ' s quite easy to lose sight of this fact . It ' s not that the caricaturist ' s lines , vigorous with expression , are absent here . But Daumier was not being topical or timely in this painting . He ' s dealing with ideas and ideals  --  the stuff of great art  --  and it ' s as appropriate to our own time as to his , or , for that matter to Cervantes ' s. // Indeed , the story of Don Quixote is in one sense an allegory symbolizing the brave army of idealism clashing with the formidable force of practical ( even pedestrian ) realism . And yet on the journey through life , they both bump along the same road together , sometimes supportive , other yimes obstructive , but curiously needing each other for balance. // Daumier not only understood the allegory , but recognized and even became engrossed in these two sides to human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sancho Panza together . Bur as tolerant and almost caring as he was for the Sancho Panza aspect in man , Daumier himself was a stouthearted idealist and therefore gave his sympathy and appreciation to Don Quixote . In fact , that sympathy communicates itself most persuasively in this painting. // But how has he done it ? I believe the answer lies partly in what Daumier was as an individual . He was intensely preoccupied with ideals and the odds against those ideals . During a time when France was hesitating between the Republic and the monarchy , Daumier steadfastly held to the rule of democracy  --  to social , political , and economic equality and freedom of the printed word. // So for nearly 40 years he worked as a caricaturist for French periodicals , lampooning the politics , the newly rich Parisians and their ways , the pompous and insensitive law courts , and , daringly , the king . But behind all those lampoons , he remained both a humanist and a patriotic Frenchman , beavering away to achieve the greatest good for his country . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them bold , wickedly witty , keenly perceptive and brave . In fact one caricature , done when he was only 23 , presented such a flagrant criticism of the so-called " Citizen King " Louis-Philippe that he was thrown into prison for six months. // There we are again , stumbling over that word " ideals . " Don Quixote ideals . And with it all , prepared to sacrifice whatever was necessary for them . His whole life was a struggle against poverty , and his last years were spent blind , living in a cottage given to him generously by the artist Corot. // His work has been likened to that of the novelist Balzac , but I see a stronger parallel with his English contemporary , Charles Dickens . For both were boys from the country , brought by their families to the metropolis and once there forced to eke out some sort of spare living . The most pungent influence on their impressionable minds came from their common exposure to the law courts while apprenticed to lawyers . And here they witnessed such a cavalcade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one direction  --  to represent aspects of what they saw or the evils that led up to such sorrow. // As artists , both were moralists , intent on opening people ' s minds to conditions that needed correcting . But they could tell their moral tales with such rich wit and irresistible detail that we are amused or fascinated before we are edified . Above all , they both knew human nature so thoroughly that they were like actors , slipping underneath the skin of their characters and presenting such true pictures that we are almost taken in . But exaggeration is the tool of the caricaturist , and through it we usually know just enough of the difference between the real and the impersonation to grasp the point of the characterization. // The point of " Don Quixote y Sancho Panza " is that it ' s a sort of culmination point  --  a symbol of what Daumier has fought for and experienced . And it shows his coming to terms with those two dissimilar companions. // That ' s partly why this painting presents such a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill as an artist . Here we have the inspired Don Quixote riding boldly out of a darkened past into the promising sunrise of a new day . It ' s a glowing pink sunrise and it gives the whole picture an almost holy florescence . Nothing is drawn in detail , but the outlined implications are pointed . We can ' t exactly see either the form of the errant knight or his horse . But Daumier ' s dexterity with line and shading tells us of the wiry determination of this gaunt visionary astride his trusty but weary steed . Through shapes and drawing , he manages to express in this figure a sort of laid-back confrontation with the world . How he achieves this I believe has something to do with the knight ' s rounded posture , those perky puffed sleeves , and the piercing challenge of his lance. // And what of the plodding Sancho Panza , riding reluctantly out of the shadowy hills ? The contrast is as striking as it is in Cervantes ' s novel . He ' s such a plump Sancho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , foolishly allowing his donkey to lead him onward . We might even say that he ' s a mere lump of a chump , nearly swallowed in shade . Except , that is , for the affectionate handling of the outline . And from this image we can sense that there was no criticism for Sancho Panza ' s limitations . That he had no vision , no lofty ideals , not even the capacity to share his master ' s dedication , Daumier accepts with a certain maturity . Nevertheless , he places the fat figure right in front of our eyes  --  a weighty ballast for the precious cargo up front. // If he has produced nothing other than this painting , Daumier would still be considered a great artist . But when I think of his 4 , 000 lithographs , his 200 small oil paintings , and his large number of sculptured figures , I begin to think that we all owe this gallant Don Quixote of a man a very profound bow. // //            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
