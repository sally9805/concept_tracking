 | she may be scratching herself and thinking about what she did last night . So I ignored it and kept on toward the exit end of the corridor . That pesky Eye should have followed me as I was the only mass in that passageway radiating at thirty-seven degrees . But it tarried , three seconds at least , scanning that locker , before again fastening on me . I was estimating which of three possible courses of action was safest when that maverick piece of my brain took over and my hands executed a fourth : My pocket pen became a laser beam and " killed " that Public Eye  --  killed it dead as I held the beam at full power until the Eye dropped to the deck , not only blinded but with antigrav shorted out . And its memory scrubbed  --  I hoped . I used my shadow 's credit card again , working the locker 's latch with my pen to avoid disturbing his thumbprint . It took a heavy shove with my boot to force the Eye into that crowded locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else . Like most ports of entry Beanstalk Kenya has travelers ' amenities on both sides of the barrier . Instead of going through inspection I found the washrooms and paid cash to use a bath-dressingroom . Twenty-seven minutes later I not only had had a bath but also had acquired different hair , different clothes , another face  --  what takes three hours to put on will come off in fifteen minutes of soap and hot water . I was not eager to show my real face but I had to get rid of the persona I had used on this mission . What part of it had not washed down the drain now went into the shredder : jump suit , boots , pouch , fingerprints , contact lenses , passport . The passport I now carried used my right name  --  well , one of my names  --  a stereograph of my bare face , and had a very sincere Ell-Five transient stamp in it . Before shredding the personal items I had taken off the corpse , I looked through them  --  and paused . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other three passports ? Probably somewhere on the dead meat in that locker . I had not given it a proper search  --  no time ! ? I had simply grabbed what he carried in his pouch . Go back and look ? If I kept trotting back and opening a locker full of still-warm corpse , someone was bound to notice . By taking his cards and passport I had hoped to postpone identifying the  | body and thereby give myself more time to get clear but  --  wait a moment . Mmm , yes , passport and Diners Club card were both for " Adolf Belsen . " American Express extended credit to " Albert Beaumont " and the Bank of Hong Kong took care of " Arthur Bookman " while MasterCard provided for " Archibald Buchanan . " I " reconstructed " the crime : **25;268;TOOLONG had just thumbed the latch of the locker when Belsen sapped him from behind , shoved him into the locker , used his own Diners Club card to lock it , and left hastily . Yes , an excellent theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those IDs and credit cards went back of my own in my wallet ; " Belsen 's " passport I concealed about my person . I could not stand a skin search but there are ways to avoid a skin search including ( but not limited to ) bribery , influence , corruption , misdirection , and razzle-dazzle . As I came out of the washroom , passengers from the next capsule were trickling in and queuing up at Customs , Health , and Immigration ; I joined a queue . The CHI officer remarked on how very light my jumpbag was and asked about the state of the uphigh black market . I gave him my best stupid look , the one on my passport picture . About then he found the correct amount of squeeze tucked into my passport and dropped the matter . I asked him for the best hotel and the best restaurant . He said that he was n't supposed to make recommendations but that he thought well of the Nairobi Hilton . As for food , if I could afford it , the Fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food in Africa . He hoped that I would enjoy my stay in Kenya . I thanked him . A few minutes later I was down the mountain and in the city , and regretting it . Kenya Station is over five kilometers high ; the air is always thin and cold . Nairobi is higher than Denver , nearly as high as Ciudad de Mexico , but it is only a fraction of the height of Mount Kenya and it is just a loud shout from the equator . The air felt thick and too warm to breathe ; almost at once my clothes were soggy with sweat ; I could feel my feet starting to swell  --  and besides they ached from full gee . I do n't like off-Earth assignments but getting back from one is worse . I called on mind-control training to help me not notice my dis  | comfort . Garbage . If my mind-control master had spent less time squatting in lotus and more time in Kenya , his instruction might have been more useful . I forgot it and concentrated on the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lobby of the Hilton was pleasantly cool . Best of all , it held a fully automated travel bureau . I went in , found an empty booth , sat down in front of the terminal . At once the attendant showed up . " May I help you ? " I told her I thought I could manage ; the keyboard looked familiar . ( It was an ordinary Kensington 400 . ) She persisted : " I 'd be glad to punch it for you . I do n't have anyone waiting . " She looked about sixteen , a sweet face , a pleasant voice , and a manner that convinced me that she really did take pleasure in being helpful . What I wanted least was someone helping me while I did things with credit cards that were n't mine . So I slipped her a medium-size tip while telling her that I really did prefer to punch it myself  --  but I would shout if I got into difficulties . She protested that I did not have to tip her  --  but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Adolf Belsen " took the tube to Cairo , then semiballistic to Hong Kong , where he had reserved a room at the Peninsula , all courtesy of Diners Club . " Albert Beaumont " was on vacation . He took Safari Jets to Timbuktu , where American Express had placed him for two weeks at the luxury Shangri-La on the shore of the Sahara Sea . The Bank of Hong Kong paid " Arthur Bookman 's " way to Buenos Aires . " Archibald Buchanan " visited his native Edinburgh , travel prepaid by MasterCard . Since he could do it all by tube , with one transfer at Cairo and automated switching at Copenhagen , he should be at his ancestral home in two hours . I then used the travel computer to make a number of inquiries ? but no reservations , no purchases , and temporary memory only . Satisfied , I left the booth , asked the dimpled attendant whether or not the subway entrance I saw in the lobby would let me reach the Fat Man restaurant . She told me what turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and caught the tube for Mombasa , again paying cash . Mombasa is only thirty minutes , 450 kilometers , from Nairobi ,  | but it is at sea level , which makes Nairobi 's climate seem heavenly ; I got out as quickly as I could arrange it . So , twenty-seven hours later I was in the Illinois Province of the Chicago Imperium . A long time , you might say , for a great-circle arc of only thirteen thousand kilometers . But I did n't travel great circle and did not go through a customs barrier or an immigration checkpoint . Nor did I use a credit card , even a borrowed one . And I managed to grab seven hours of sleep in Alaska Free State ; I had n't had any sound sleep since leaving Ell-Five space city two days earlier . How ? Trade secret . I may never need that route again but someone in my line of work will need it . Besides , as my boss says , with all governments everywhere tightening down on everything wherever they can , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electronic surveillance , there is a moral obligation on each free person to fight back wherever possible  --  keep underground railways open , keep shades drawn , give misinformation to computers . Computers are literal-minded and stupid ; electronic records are n't really records . . . so it is good to be alert to opportunities to foul up the system . If you ca n't evade a tax , pay a little too much to confuse their computers . Transpose digits . And so on ... . The key to traveling half around a planet without leaving tracks is : Pay cash . Never credit , never anything that goes into a computer . And a bribe is never a bribe ; any such transfer of valuta must save face for the recipient . No matter how lavishly overpaid , civil servants everywhere are convinced that they are horribly underpaid  --  but all public employees have larceny in their hearts or they would n't be feeding at the public trough . These two facts are all you need  --  but be careful ! ? a public employee , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . I always pander to this need and the trip had been without incident . ( I did n't count the fact that the Nairobi Hilton blew up and burned a few minutes after I took the tube for Mombasa ; it would have seemed downright paranoid to think that it had anything to do with me . ) I did get rid of four credit cards and a passport just after I heard about it but I had intended to take that precaution anyhow . If the opposition wanted to cancel me  --  possible but unlikely  --  it would be swatting a fly with an ax to destroy a multimillion-crown  | property and kill or injure hundreds or thousands of others just to get me . Unprofessional . As may be . Here I was at last in the Imperium , another mission completed with only minor bobbles . I exited at Lincoln Meadows while musing that I had garnered enough brownie points to wheedle the boss out of a few weeks R &R; in New Zealand . My family , a seven S-group , was in Christchurch ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But in the meantime I relished the cool clean air and the rustic beauty of Illinois  --  it was not South Island but it was the next best thing . They say these meadows used to be covered with dingy factories  --  it seems hard to believe . Today the only building in sight from the station was the Avis livery stable across the street . At the hitching rail outside the station were two Avis RentaRigs as well as the usual buggies and farm wagons . I was about to pick one of the Avis nags when I recognized a rig just pulling in : a beautiful matched pair of bays hitched to a Lockheed landau . " Uncle Jim ! Over here ! It 's me ! " The coachman touched his whip to the brim of his top hat , then brought his team to a halt so that the landau was at the steps where I waited . He climbed down and took off his hat . " It 's good to have you home , Miss Friday . " I gave him a quick hug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong notions of propriety . They say he was convicted of advocating papism  --  some said that he was actually caught bare-handed , celebrating mass . Others said nonsense , he was infiltrating for the company and took a fall to protect others . Me , I do n't know that much about politics , but I suppose a priest would have formal manners , whether he was a real one or a member of our trade . I could be wrong ; I do n't think I 've ever seen a priest . As he handed me in , making me feel like a " lady , " I asked , " How did you happen to be here ? " " The Master sent me to meet you , miss . " " He did ? But I did n't let him know when I would arrive . " I tried to think who , on my back track , could have been part of Boss 's data net . " Sometimes I think the boss has a crystal ball . " " It do seem like it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magog and we headed for the farm . I settled back and relaxed , listening to the homey , cheerful clomp clomp ! of horses ' hooves on dirt . I woke up as Jim turned into our gate and was wide awake by  | the time he pulled under the porte-cochere . I jumped down without waiting to be a " lady " and turned to thank Jim . They hit me from both sides . Dear old Uncle Jim did not warn me . He simply watched while they took me.  | My own stupid fault ! I was taught in basic that no place is ever totally safe and that any place you habitually return to is your top danger spot , the place most likely for booby trap , ambush , stakeout . But apparently I had learned this only as parrot rote ; as an old pro I had ignored it . So it bit me . This rule is analogous to the fact that the person most likely to murder you is some member of your own family  --  and that grim statistic is ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own family ? Better to be dead ! My worst stupidity was to ignore a loud , clear , specific warning , not just a general principle . How had dear old " Uncle " Jim managed to meet my capsule ? ? on the right day and almost to the minute . Crystal ball ? Boss is smarter than the rest of us but he does not use magic . I may be wrong but I 'm positive . If Boss had supernatural powers he would not need the rest of us . I had not reported my movements to Boss ; I did n't even tell him when I left Ell-Five . This is doctrine ; he does not encourage us to check in every time we move , as he knows that a leak can be fatal . Even I did n't know that I was going to take that particular capsule until I took it . I had ordered breakfast in Hotel Seward 's coffee shop , stood up without eating it , dropped some money on the counter  --  three minutes later I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopping off that tail at Kenya Beanstalk Station  | had not eliminated all tails on me . Either there had been a backup tail on the spot or Mr. " Belsen " ( " Beaumont , " " Bookman , " " Buchanan " ) had been missed at once and replaced quickly . Possibly they had been with me all along or perhaps what had happened to " Belsen " had made them cautious about stepping on my heels . Or last night 's sleep may have given them time to catch me . Which variant was immaterial . Shortly after I climbed into that capsule in Alaska , someone had phoned a message somewhat like this : " Firefly to Dragonfly . Mosquito left here express capsule International Corridor nine minutes ago . Anchorage traffic control shows capsule programmed to sidetrack and open Lincoln Meadows your time eleven-oh-three . " Or some such chatter . Some unfriendly had seen me enter that capsule and had phoned ahead ; otherwise sweet old Jim would not have been able to meet me . Logic . Hindsight is wonderful  --  it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've busted it . But I made them pay for their drinks . If I had been smart , I would have surrendered once I saw that I was hopelessly outnumbered . But I 'm not smart ; I 've already proved that . Better yet , I would have run like hell when Jim told me the boss had sent him ... instead of climbing in and taking a nap , fer Gossake . I recall killing only one of them . Possibly two . But why did they insist on doing it the hard way ? They could have waited until I was inside and gassed me , or used a sleepy dart , or even a sticky rope . They had to take me alive , that was clear . Did n't they know that a field agent with my training when attacked goes automatically into overdrive ? Maybe I 'm not the only stupid . But why waste time by raping me ? This whole operation had amateurish touches . No professional group uses either beating or rape before interrogation today ; there is no profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either or both . For rape she ( or he ? I hear it 's worse for males ) can either detach the mind and wait for it to be over , or ( advanced training ) emulate the ancient Chinese adage . Or , in place of method A or B , or combined with B if the agent 's histrionic ability is up to it , the victim can treat rape as an opportunity to gain an edge over her captors . I 'm no great shakes  | as an actress but I try and , while it has never enabled me to turn the tables on unfriendlies , at least once it kept me alive . This time method C did not affect the outcome but did cause a little healthy dissension . Four of them ( my estimate from touch and body odors ) had me in one of the upstairs bedrooms . It may have been my own room but I could not be certain as I had been unconscious for a while and was now dressed ( solely ) in adhesive tape over my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gang bang with minor sadism . . . which I ignored , being very busy with method C. In my mind I called them " Straw Boss " ( seemed to be in charge ) , " Rocks " ( they called him that  --  rocks in his head , probably ) , " Shorty " ( take that either way ) , and " the other one " as he did not have distinctive characteristics . I worked on all of them  --  method acting , of course  --  reluctant , have to be forced , then gradually your passion overcomes you ; you just ca n't help yourself . Any man will believe that routine ; they are suckers for it  --  but I worked especially hard on Straw Boss as I hoped to achieve the status of teacher 's pet or some such . Straw Boss was n't so bad ; methods B and C combined nicely . But I worked hardest on Rocks because with him it had to be C combined with A ; his breath was so foul . He was n't too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to ignore it and make my responses flattering to his macho ego . After he became flaccid he said , " Mac , we 're wasting our time . This slut enjoys it . " " So get out of the way and give the kid another chance . He 's ready . " " Not yet . I 'm going to slap her around , make her take us seriously . " He let me have a big one , left side of my face . I yelped . " Cut that out ! " ? Straw Boss 's voice . " Who says so ? Mac , you 're getting too big for your britches . " " I say so . " It was a new voice , very loud  --  amplified  --  from the sound-system speaker in the ceiling , no doubt . " Rocky , Mac is your squad leader , you know that . Mac , send Rocky to me ; I want a word with him . " " Major , I was just trying to help ! " " You heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Grab your pants and get moving . " Suddenly the man 's weight was no longer on me and his stinking breath was no longer in my face . Happiness is relative .  | The voice in the ceiling spoke again : " Mac , is it true that Miss Friday simply enjoys the little ceremony we arranged for her ? " " It 's possible , Major , " Straw Boss said slowly . " She does act like it . " " How about it , Friday ? Is this the way you get your kicks ? " I did n't answer his question . Instead I discussed him and his family in detail , with especial attention to his mother and sister . If I had told him the truth  --  that Straw Boss would be rather pleasant under other circumstances , that Shorty and the other man did not matter one way or the other , but that Rocks was an utter slob whom I would cancel at the first opportunity  --  it would have blown method C. " The same to you , sweetie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappoint you but I 'm a creche baby . Not even a wife , much less a mother or a sister . Mac , put the cuffs on her and throw a blanket over her . But do n't give her a shot ; I 'll be talking to her later . " Amateur . My boss would never have alerted a prisoner to expect interrogation . " Hey , creche baby ! " " Yes , dear ? " I accused him of a vice not requiring a mother or a sister but anatomically possible  --  so I am told  --  for some males . The voice answered , " Every night , hon. It 's very soothing . " So mark one up for the Major . I decided that , with training , he could have been a pro . Nevertheless he was a bloody amateur and I did n't respect him . He had wasted one , maybe two , of his ables , caused me unnecessarily to suffer bruises , contusions , and multiple personal indignities  --  even heartbreaking ones had I been an untrained female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boss had been doing it , the prisoner would have spilled his/her guts at once and spent those two hours spouting her fullest memoirs into a recorder . Straw Boss even took the trouble to police me  --  led me into the bathroom and waited quietly while I peed , without making a production of it  --  and that was amateurish , too , as a useful technique , of the cumulative sort , in interrogating an amateur ( not a pro ) is to force him or her to break toilet training . If she has been protected from the harsher things in life or if he suffers from excessive amour-propre  --  as most males do  --  it is at least as effective as pain , and potentiates either with pain or with other humiliations . I do n't think Mac knew this . I figured him for basically a decent soul despite his taste for  --  no , aside from his taste for a bit of rape  --  a taste common to most males according to the kinseys . Somebody had put the mattress back on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie on my back with my arms out . Then he cuffed me to the legs of the bed , using two pairs . They were n't the peace-officer type , but special ones , velvet-lined  --  the sort of junk used by idiots for SM games . I wondered who the pervert was ? The Major ? Mac made sure that they were secure but not too tight , then gently spread a blanket over me . I would not have been surprised had he kissed me good-night . But he did not . He left quietly . Had he kissed me would method C call for returning it in full ? Or turning my face and trying to refuse it ? A nice question . Method C is based on I-just-can't-help-myself and requires precise judgment as to when and how much enthusiasm to show . If the rapist suspects the victim of faking , she has lost the ploy . I had just decided , somewhat regretfully , that this hypothetical kiss should have been refused , when I fell asleep .  | I was not allowed enough sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me and had sunk into deep sleep , soggy with it , when I was roused by a slap . Not Mac . Rocks , of course . Not as hard as he had hit me earlier but totally unnecessary . It seemed to me that he blamed me for whatever disciplining he had received from the Major . . . and I promised myself that , when time came to cancel him , I would do it slowly . I heard Shorty say , " Mac said not to hit her . " " I did n't hit her . That was just a love tap to wake her up . Shut up and mind your own business . Stand clear and keep your gun on her . On her , you idiot ! ? not on me . " They took me down into the basement and into one of our own interrogation chambers . Shorty and Rocks left  --  I think that Shorty left and I know that Rocks did ; his stink went away  --  and an interrogation team took over . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever said a word . The only voice was the one I thought of as " the Major . " It seemed to be coming through a speaker . " Good morning , Miss Friday . " ( Morning ? It seemed unlikely . ) " Howdy , creche baby ! " " I 'm glad that you are in fine fettle , dear , as this session is likely  | to prove long and tiring . Even unpleasant . I want to know all about you , love . " " Fire away . What will you have first ? " " Tell me about this trip you just made , every tiny detail . And outline this organization you belong to . I might as well tell you that we already know a great deal about it , so if you lie , I will know it . Not even a little white fib , dear  --  for I will know it and what happens then I will regret but you will regret it far more . " " Oh , I wo n't lie to you . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A recorder is running . " " Okay . " For three hours I spilled my guts . This was according to doctrine . My boss knows that ninety-nine out of a hundred will crack under sufficient pain , that almost that percentage will crack under long interrogation combined with nothing more than raw fatigue , but only Buddha Himself can resist certain drugs . Since he does not expect miracles and hates to waste agents , standard doctrine is : " If they grab you , sing ! " So he makes sure that a field operative never knows anything critical . A courier never knows what she is carrying . I know nothing about policy . I do n't know my boss 's name . I 'm not sure whether we are a government agency or an arm of one of the multinationals . I do know where the farm is but so do many other people . . . and it is ( was ) very well defended . Other places I have visited only via closed authorized power vehicles  --  an APV took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the far end of the farm . Or not . " Major , how did you crack this place ? It was pretty strongly defended . " " I ask the questions , bright eyes . Let 's have that part again about how you were followed out of the Beanstalk capsule . " After a long time of this , when I had told all I knew and was repeating myself , the Major stopped me . " Dear , you tell a very convincing story and I do n't believe more than every third word . Let 's start procedure B. " Somebody grabbed my left arm and a needle went in . Babble juice ! I hoped these frimping amateurs were n't as clumsy with it as they were in some other ways ; you can get very dead in a hurry with an overdose . " Major ! I had better sit down ! " " Put her in a chair . " Somebody did so . For the next thousand years I did my best to tell exactly the  | same story no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair . They did n't stick me back onto it but stretched me on the cold concrete instead . I went on babbling . Some silly time later I was given some other shot . It made my teeth ache and my eyeballs felt hot but it snapped me awake . " Miss Friday ! " " Yes , sir ? " " Are you awake now ? " " I think so . " " My dear , I think you have been most carefully indoctrinated under hypnosis to tell the same story under drugs that you tell so well without drugs . That 's too bad as I must now use another method . Can you stand up ? " " I think so . I can try . " " Stand her up . Do n't let her fall . " Someone  --  some two  --  did so . I was n't steady but they held me . " Start procedure C , item five . " Someone stomped a heavy boot on my bare toes . I screamed . Look , you ! If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man routine just makes them worse and it worse . Take it from one who 's been there . Scream your head off and crack as fast as possible . I am not going to give details of what happened during the following endless time . If you have any imagination , it would nauseate you , and to tell it makes me want to throw up . I did , several times . I passed out , too , but they kept reviving me and the voice kept on asking questions . Apparently the time came when reviving did n't work , for the next thing I knew I was back in bed  --  the same bed , I suppose ? and again handcuffed to it . I hurt all over . That voice again , right above my head . " Miss Friday . " " What the hell do you want ? " " Nothing . If it 's any consolation to you , dear girl , you are the only subject I have ever questioned that I could not get the truth out of , eventually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear . "  | The bloody amateur ! Every word I had said to him was the naked truth . Someone came in and gave me another hypodermic shot . Presently the pain went away and I slept . I think I slept a long time . I either had confused dreams or half-awake periods or both . Some of it had to be dreams  --  dogs do talk , many of them , but they do n't lecture on the rights of living artifacts , do they ? Sounds of a ruckus and people running up and down may have been real . But it felt like a nightmare because I tried to get out of bed and discovered that I could n't lift my head , much less get up and join the fun . There came a time when I decided that I really was awake , because cuffs no longer bothered my wrists and sticky tape was no longer across my eyes . But I did n't jump up or even open my eyes . I knew that the first few seconds after I opened my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have to escape . I twitched muscles without moving . Everything seemed to be under control although I was more than a little sore here and there and several other places . Clothes ? Forget them  --  not only did I have no idea where my clothes might be but also there is no time to stop to dress when you are running for your life . Now to plan ? There did n't seem to be anyone in this room ; was anyone on this floor ? Hold still and listen . If and when I was fairly sure I was alone on this floor , get noiselessly out of bed and up the stairs like a mouse , on past the third floor into the attic , and hide . Wait for dark . Out an attic gable , down the roof and the back wall and into the woods . If I reached the woods back of  | the house , they would never catch me . . . but until I did , I would be an easy target . The chances ? One in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranked up . The weakest spot in a poor plan was the high probability of being spotted before I was clear of the house . . . because , if I was spotted  --  no , when I was spotted  --  I would not only have to kill but I would have to be utterly quiet in doing so-because the alternative was to wait until they terminated me ... which would be shortly after " the Major " decided that there was no more to be squeezed out of me . Clumsy as these goons were , they were not so stupid  --  or the Major was not so stupid  --  as to let a witness who has been tortured and raped stay alive . I stretched my ears in all directions and listened . " Nothing was stirring , not even a mouse . " No point in waiting ; every moment I delayed brought that much closer the time when someone would be stirring . I opened my eyes . " Awake , I see . Good . " " Boss ! Where am I ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . Back up and try again . " I looked around me . A bedroom , possibly a hospital room . No windows . No-glare lighting . A characteristic gravelike silence enhanced rather than broken by the softest of ventilation sighing . I looked back at Boss . He was a welcome sight . Same old unstylish eye patch  --  why would n't he take time to have that eye regenerated ? His canes were leaning against a table , in reach . He was wearing his usual sloppy raw-silk suit , a cut that looked like badly tailored pajamas . I was awfully glad to see him . " I still want to know where I am . And how . And why . Somewhere underground , surely  --  but where ? " " Underground , surely , quite a few meters . Where ' you will be told when you need to know , or at least how to get to and from .

I found Mr. Mortenson and delivered to him the contents of my trick bellybutton . Routine was interrupted by a most unusual factor : The space city was experiencing an epidemic of respiratory disorder , etiology unknown , and I contracted it . Mr. Mortenson was most kind ; he kept me at home and his wives nursed me with great skill and tender loving care . Boss , I want them compensated . " " Noted . Continue .

Oh , God , Boss , this is awful . " " No , " he said gently , " you succeeded . In the face of great danger and monumental obstacles you succeeded perfectly . " " I did ? " ( Ever had the Victoria Cross pinned on you ? ) " Boss , cut the double talk and draw me a diagram . " " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . I have a ' possum pouch , created by plastic surgery , behind my bellybutton . It is n't large but you can crowd one whale of a lot of microfilm into a space of about one cubic centimeter . You ca n't see it because the sphincter valve that serves it holds the navel scar closed . My bellybutton looks normal . Unbiased judges tell me that I have a pretty belly and a sightly navel . . . which , in some important ways , is better than having a pretty face , which I do n't have . The sphincter is a synthetic silicone elastomer that holds the navel tight at all times , even if I am unconscious . This is necessary as there are no nerves there to give voluntary control of contraction and relaxation , such as is possible with the anal , vaginal , and  | ? for some people  --  throat sphincters . To load the pouch use a dab of K-Y jelly or other nonpetroleum lubricant , and push it in by thumb  --  no sharp corners , please ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pull the artificial sphincter open as much as I can , then press hard with my abdominal muscles  --  and it pops right out . The art of smuggling things in the human body has a long history . The classic ways are in the mouth , in the nasal sinuses , in the stomach , the gut , the rectum , vagina , bladder , eye socket of a missing eye , ear canal , and exotic and not very useful methods using tattoos sometimes covered with hair . Every one of the classic ways is known to every customs officer and every special agent public or private the world round , Luna , space cities , other planets , and anywhere men have reached . So forget them . The only classic method that can still beat a pro is the Purloined Letter . But the Purloined Letter is high art indeed and , even when used perfectly , it should be planted on an innocent who ca n't give it away under drugs . Take a look at the next thousand bellybuttons you encounter socially . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one or two will conceal surgically emplaced hideaways like mine . You can expect a spate of them soon , then no more will be emplaced as any novelty in smuggling becomes useless once the word gets around . In the meantime customs officers are going to be poking rude fingers into bellybuttons . I hope a lot of those officers get poked in the eye by angry victims  --  navels tend to be sensitive and ticklish . " Friday , the weak point of that pochette in you has always been that any skillful interrogation ? " " They were clumsy . " " ? or rough interrogation using drugs could force you to mention its existence . " " Must have been after they shot me with babble juice . I do n't recall mentioning it . " " Probably . Or word may have come to them through other channels , as several people know of it  --  you , me , three nurses , two surgeons , one anesthesiologist , possibly others . Too many . No matter how our antagonists knew , they did remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glum ; what they received was a very long list reduced to microfilm of all the restaurants listed in a 1928 telephone book of the former city of New York . No doubt  | there is a computer somewhere working on this list right now , attempting to break the code concealed in it . . . which will take a long time as there is no code concealed in it . A dummy load . Sense-free . " " And for this I have to chase all the way to Ell-Five , eat scummy food , get sick on the Beanstalk , and be buggered about by brutal bastards ! " " Sorry about the last , Friday . But do you think I would risk the life of my most skillful agent on a useless mission ? " ( See why I work for the arrogant bastard ? Flattery will get you anywhere . ) " Sorry , sir . " " Check your appendectomy scar . " " Huh ? " I reached under the sheet and felt it , then flipped the sheet back and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incision was less than two centimeters and straight through the scar ; no muscle tissue was disturbed . The item was withdrawn about twenty-four hours ago by reopening the same incision . With the accelerated repair methods that were used on you I am told that in two more days you will not be able to find the new scar in the old . But I am very glad that the Mortensons 4 took such good care of you as I am sure that the artificial symptoms induced in you to cover what had to be done to you were not pleasant . By the way , there really is a catarrhal-fever epidemic there  --  fortuitous window dressing . " Boss paused . I stubbornly refused to ask him what I was carrying  --  he would not have told me anyhow . Shortly he added , " You were telling me about your trip home . " " The trip down was without incident . Boss , the next time you send me into space I want to go first-class , in an antigrav ship . Not via that silly Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyhook is safer than any ship . The Quito cable was lost through sabotage , not materiel failure . " " Stingy . " " I do n't intend to bind the mouths of the kine . You may use antigrav from here on if circumstances and timing permit . This time there were reasons to use the Kenya Beanstalk . " " Maybe so , but someone tailed me out of the Beanstalk capsule . As soon as we were alone , I killed him . " I paused . Someday , someday , I am going to cause his face to register surprise . I retackled the subject diagonally :  | " Boss , I need a refresher course , with some careful reorientation . " " Really ? To what end ? " " My kill reflex is too fast . I do n't discriminate . That bloke had n't done anything to rate killing . Surely , he was tailing me . But I should either have shaken him , there or in Nairobi , or , at most , knocked him cold and placed him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss your possible need later . Continue . " I told him about the Public Eye and " Belsen 's " quadruple identity and how I had sent them to the four winds , then I outlined my trip home . He checked me . " You did not mention the destruction of that hotel in Nairobi . " " Huh ? But , Boss , that had nothing to do with me . I was halfway to Mombasa . " " My dear Friday , you are too modest . A large number of people and a huge amount of money have gone into trying to keep you from completing your mission , including a last-ditch attempt at our former farm . You may assume , as least hypothesis , that the bombing of the Hilton had as its sole purpose killing you . " " Hmm . Boss , apparently you knew that it would be this rough . Could n't you have warned me ? " " Would you have been more alert , more resolute , had I filled your mind with vague warnings of unknown dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hell I did n't ! Uncle Jim met my capsule when he should not have known the time I would arrive ; that should have set off every alarm in my head . The instant I laid eyes on him I should have dived back down the hole and taken any capsule anywhere . " " Whereupon it would have become extremely difficult for us to achieve rendezvous , which would have aborted your mission as thoroughly as losing what you carried . My child , if affairs had gone smoothly , Jim would have met you at my behest ; you underestimate my intelligence net as well as the effort we put into trying to watch over you . But I did not send Jim to get you because at that moment I was running . Hobbling , to be precise . Hurrying . Trying to escape . I assume that Jim took the ETA message himself  --  from our man , or that of our antagonists , or possibly from both . " Boss , if I had known it at the time , I would have fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . When the time comes , I want to cancel him myself . He 's mine . " " Friday , in our profession it is undesirable to hold grudges . " " I do n't hold many but Uncle Jim is special . And there is another case I want to handle myself . But I 'll argue with you later . Say , is it true that Uncle Jim used to be a papist priest ? " Boss almost looked surprised . " Where did you hear that non-sense ? " " Around and about . Gossip . " " ' Human , All Too Human . ' Gossip is a vice . Let me settle it . Prufit was a con man . I met him in prison , where he did something for me , important enough that I made a place for him in our organization . My mistake . My inexcusable mistake , as a con man never stops being a con man ; he ca n't . But I suffered from a will to believe , a defect of character that I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . " I told Boss how they had grabbed me . " Five of them , I think . Possibly only four . " " Six , I believe . Descriptions . " " None , Boss , I was too busy . Well , one . I had one sharp look at him just as I killed him . About a hundred and seventy-five tall , weight around seventy-five or - six . Age near thirty-five . Blondish , smooth-shaven . Slavic . But he was the only one my eye photographed . Because he held still . Involuntarily . As his neck snapped . " " Was the other one you killed blond or brunet ? " " Belsen ' ? Brunet . " " No , at the farm . Never mind . You killed two and injured three before they piled enough bodies on you to hold you down by sheer weight . A credit to your instructor , let me add . In escaping , we had not been able to thin them down enough to keep them from taking you . . . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we recaptured you by your having earlier taken out so many of their effectives . Even though you were chained up and unconscious at the time , you won the final fracas . Go on , please . " That about wraps it up , Boss . A gang rape next , followed by interrogation , direct , then under drugs , then under pain . " " I 'm sorry about the rape , Friday . The usual bonuses . You will find them enhanced as I judge the circumstances to have been unusually offensive . " " Oh , not that bad . I 'm hardly a twittering virgin . I can recall  | social occasions that were almost as unpleasant . Except one man . I do n't know his face but I can identify him . I want him ! I want him as badly as I want Uncle Jim . Worse , maybe , as I want to punish him a bit before I let him die . " " I can only repeat what I said earlier . For us , personal grudges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll risk it for this bucko . Boss , I do n't hold the rape qua rape against him ; they were ordered to rape me under the silly theory that it would soften me up for interrogation . But the scum should bathe and he should have his teeth fixed and he should brush them and use a mouthwash . And somebody must tell him that it is not polite to slap a woman with whom he has copulated . I do n't know his face but I know his voice and his odor and his build and his nickname . Rocks or Rocky . " " Jeremy Rockford . " " Huh ? You know him ? Where is he ? " " I once knew him and I recently had one clear look at him , enough to be sure . Requiescat in pace . " " Really ? Oh , hell . I hope he did n't die quietly . " " He did not die quietly . Friday , I have not told you all that I know ? " " You never do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their assault on the farm succeeded because Jim Prufit had cut all power just before they hit us . This left us nothing but hand weapons for the few who wear arms at the farm , only bare hands for most of us . I ordered evacuation and most of us escaped through a tunnel prepared and concealed when the house was rebuilt . I am sorry and proud to say that three of our best , the three who were armed when we were hit , elected to play Horatius at the bridge . I know that they died as I kept the tunnel open until I could tell by the sounds that it had been entered by the raiders . Then I blasted it . " It took some hours to round up enough people and to mount our counterattack , especially in arranging for enough authorized power vehicles . While we conceivably could have attacked on foot , we had to have at least one APV as ambulance for you . " " How did you know I was alive ? " " The same way I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rear guard . Remote pickups . Friday , everything that was done to you and by you , everything you said and was said to you , was monitored and recorded . I was unable to monitor in  | person  --  busy preparing the counterattack  --  but the essential parts were played for me as time permitted . Let me add that I am proud of you . " By knowing which pickups recorded what , we knew where they were holding you , the fact that you were cuffed , how many were in the house , where they were , when they settled down , and who stayed awake . By relay to the command APV I knew the situation in the house right to the moment of attack . We hit ? They hit , I mean  --  our people hit . I do n't lead attacks hobbling on these two sticks ; I wield the baton . Our people hit the house , were inside , the designated four picked you up  --  one armed only with a bolt cutter  --  and all were out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Boss ! Your lovely farmhouse ? " " When a ship is sinking , one does not worry about the diningroom linens . We can never use the farm again . Burning the house destroyed many awkward records and many secret and quasi-secret items of equipment . But , most compelling , burning the house gave us a quick cleanup of the parties who had compromised its secrets . Our cordon was in place before we used incendiaries , then each one was shot as he attempted to come out . " That was when I saw your acquaintance Jeremy Rockford . He was burned in the leg as he came out the east door . He stumbled back in , changed his mind and tried again to escape , fell and was trapped . From the sounds he made I can assure you that he did not die quietly . " " Ugh . Boss , when I said that I wanted to punish him before I killed him , I did n't mean anything as horrible as burning him to death . " " Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning barn , he would have died as the others did . . . quickly , from laser beam . Shot on sight , for we took no prisoners . " " Not even for interrogation ? " " Not correct doctrine , I so stipulate . But , Friday my dear , you are unaware of the emotional atmosphere . All had heard the tapes , at least of the rape and of your third interrogation , the torture . Our lads and lassies would not have taken prisoners even if I had so ordered . But I did not attempt to . I want you to know that you are held in high esteem by your colleagues . Including the many who have never met you and whom you are unlikely ever to meet . "  | Boss reached for his canes , struggled to his feet . " I 'm seven minutes over the time your physician told me I could visit . We 'll talk tomorrow . You are to rest now . A nurse will be in to put you to sleep . Sleep and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I spent them in a warm glow . " High esteem . " When you have never belonged and can never really belong , words like that mean everything . They warmed me so much that I did n't mind not being human .  | Someday I 'm going to win an argument with Boss . But do n't hold your breath . There were days when I did not lose arguments with him  --  the days he did not visit me . It started with a difference of opinion over how long I was going to have to remain in therapy . I felt ready to go home or back to duty , either one , after four days . While I did n't want to get into a dockside fight just yet , I could take light duty  --  or a trip to New Zealand , my first choice . All my hurts were repairing . They had n't been all that much : lots of burns , four broken ribs , simple fractures left tibia and fibula , multiple compound fractures of the bones of my right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skull fracture without complications , and ( messy but least disabling ) somebody had sawed off my right nipple . The last item and the burns and the broken toes were all that I recalled ; the others must have happened while I was distracted by other matters . Boss said , " Friday , you know that it will take at least six weeks to regenerate that missing nipple . " " But plastic surgery for a simple cosmetic job would heal in a week . Dr. Krasny told me so . " " Young woman , when anyone in this organization is maimed in line of duty , she will be restored as perfectly as therapeutic art can achieve . In addition to that our permanent policy , in your case there is another reason , compelling and sufficient . We each have a moral obligation to conserve and preserve beauty in this world ;  | there is none to waste . You have an unusually comely body ; damage to it is deplorable . It must be repaired . " " Cosmetic surgery is all right , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk in these jugs . And anybody in bed with me wo n't care . " " Friday , you may have convinced yourself that you will never have need to lactate . But esthetically a functional breast is very different from a surgery-shaped imitation . That hypothetical bedmate might not know . . . but you would know and I would know . No , my dear . You will be restored to your former perfection . " " Hmm ! When are you going to get that eye regenerated ? " " Do n't be rude , child . In my case , no esthetic issue obtains . " So I got my tit back as good as ever or maybe better . The next argument was over the retraining I felt I needed to correct my hair-trigger kill reflex . When I brought up the matter again , Boss looked as if he had just bitten into something nasty . " Friday , I do not recall that you have ever made a kill that turned out to be a mistake . Have you made any kills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said hastily . " I never killed anybody until I went to work for you and I have n't made any that I did n't report to you . " " In that case all of your killings have been in self-defense . " " All but that Belsen ' character . That was n't self-defense ; he never laid a finger on me . " " Beaumont . At least that was the name he usually used . Selfdefense sometimes must take the form of Do unto others what they would do unto you but do it first . ' De Camp , I believe . Or some other of the twentieth-century school of pessimistic philosophers . I 'll call up Beaumont 's dossier so that you may see for yourself that he belonged on everyone 's better-dead list . " " Do n't bother . Once I looked into his pouch , I knew that he was n't following me to kiss me . But that was afterward . " Boss took several seconds to answer , far beyond his wont . " Friday , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " My chin dropped and my eyes widened . That was all the answer I made . " I did n't intend to frighten you off the nest , " Boss said dryly . " You will have deduced that this organization includes assassins . I do n't want to lose you as a courier ; you are my best . But we always need skilled assassins as their attrition rate is high . However , there is this major difference between a courier and an assassin : A courier kills only in self-defense and often by reflex . . . and , I  | concede , always with some possibility of error . . . as not all couriers have your supreme talent for instantly integrating all factors and reaching a necessary conclusion . " " Huh ! " " You heard me correctly . Friday , one of your weaknesses is that you lack appropriate conceit . An honorable hatchet man does not kill by reflex ; he kills by planned intent . If the plan goes so far wrong that he needs to use self-defense , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned killings , he always knows why and agrees with the necessity . . . or I wo n't send him out . " ( Planned killing ? Murder , by definition . Get up in the morning , eat a hearty breakfast , then keep rendezvous with your victim , cut him down in cold blood ? Eat dinner and sleep soundly ? ) " Boss , I do n't think it is my sort of work . " " I 'm not sure that you have the temperament for it . But , for the nonce , keep an open mind . I am not sanguine about the possibility of slowing down your defense reflex . Moreover I can assure you that , if we attempt to retrain you in the way that you ask , I will not again use you as a courier . No . Risking your life is your business . . . when on your own time . But your missions are always critical ; I wo n't use a courier whose fine edge has been deliberately blunted . " Boss did not convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him again that I was not interested in becoming a hatchet man , he did not appear to listen  --  just said something about getting me something to read . I expected it  --  whatever  --  to show up on the room 's terminal . Instead , about twenty minutes after he left me , a youngster  --  well , younger than I am  --  showed up with a book , a bound book with paper pages . It had a serial number on it and was stamped " EYES ONLY " and " Need-to-Know Required " and " Top Secret SPECIAL BLUE Clearance . " I looked at it , as anxious to handle it as a snake . " Is this for me ? I think there has been a mistake . " " The Old Man does not make mistakes . Just sign the receipt . " I made him wait while I read the fine print . " This bit about never out of my sight . ' I sleep now and then . " " Call Archives , ask for the classified documents clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bounce . But try not to go to sleep until I get here . Try hard . " " Okay . " I signed the receipt , looked up and found him staring  | with bright-eyed interest . " What are you staring at ? " " Uh ? Miss Friday , you 're pretty . " I never know what to say to that sort of thing , since I 'm not . I shape up all right , surely  --  but I was fully clothed . " How did you know my name ? " " Why , everybody knows who you are . You know . Two weeks ago . At the farm . You were there . " " Oh . Yes , I was there . But I do n't remember it . " " I sure do ! " His eyes were shining . " It 's the only time I 've had a chance to be part of a combat operation . I 'm glad I had a piece of it ! " ( What do you do ? ) I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face in both my hands , kissed him carefully , about halfway between warm-sisterly and let's-do-it ! Maybe protocol called for something stronger but he was on duty and I was still on the disabled list  --  not fair to make implied promises that ca n't be kept , especially to youngsters with stars in their eyes . " Thank you for rescuing me , " I said to him soberly before letting go of his cheeks . The dear thing blushed . But he seemed very pleased . I stayed up so late reading that book that the night nurse scolded me . However , nurses need something to scold about now and then . I 'm not going to quote from the incredible document ... but listen to these subjects : Title first : The Only Deadly Weapon . Then Assassination as a Fine Art Assassination as a Political Tool Assassination for Profit Assassins Who Changed History The Society for Creative Euthanasia The Canons of the Professional Assassins Guild Amateur Assassins : Should They Be Exterminated ? Honorable Hatchet Men  --  Some Case Histories " Extreme Prejudice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminar Working Papers : Techniques &; Tools Whew ! There was no good reason for my reading all of it . But I did . It had an unholy fascination . Dirty . I resolved never to mention the possibility of changing tracks and not to bring up retraining again . Let Boss bring it up himself if he wanted to discuss it . I punched the terminal , got Archives ,  | and stated that I needed the classified documents clerk to accept custody of classified item number such-and-such and please bring my receipt . " Right away , Miss Friday , " a woman answered . Notoriety I waited with considerable unease for that youngster to show up . I am ashamed to say that this poisonous book had had a most unfortunate effect on me . It was the middle of the night , early morning ; the place was dead quiet  --  and if the dear thing laid a hand on me , I was awfully likely to forget that I was technically an invalid . I needed a chastity girdle with a big padlock . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off duty . The person who showed up with my receipt was the older woman who had answered me on the terminal . I felt both relief and disappointment  --  and chagrin that I felt disappointed . Does convalescence make everybody irresponsibly horny ? Do hospitals have a discipline problem ? I have not been ill often enough to know . The night clerk swapped my receipt for the book , then surprised me with : " Do n't I get a kiss , too ? " " Oh ! Were you there ? " " Any warm body , dear ; we were awfully short of effectives that night . I 'm not the world 's greatest but I had basic training like anyone else . Yes , I was there . Would n't have missed it . " I said , " Thank you for rescuing me , " and kissed her . I tried to make this simply a symbol , but she took charge and controlled what sort of a buss it would be . Rough and rugged , namely . She was telling me clearer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street , she would be waiting . What do you do ? There seem to be human situations for which there are no established protocols . I had just acknowledged that she had risked her life to save mine  --  precisely that , as that rescue raid was not the piece of cake that Boss 's account made it appear to be . Boss 's habitual understatement is such that he would describe the total destruction of Seattle as " a seismic disturbance . " Having thanked her for my life how could I snub her ? I could not . I let my half of the kiss answer her wordless message  --  with my fingers crossed that I would never have to keep the implied promise . Presently she broke the kiss but remained holding on to me . " Dearie , " she said , " want to know something ? Do you remember how you told off that slob they called the Major ? "  | " I remember . " " There is a bootleg piece of tape floating around of that one sequence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is highly admired by one and all . Especially me . " " That 's interesting . Are you the little gremlin who copied that piece of tape ? " " Why , how could you think such a thing ? " She grinned . " Do you mind ? " I thought it over for all of three milliseconds . " No . If the people who rescued me enjoy hearing what I told that bastard , I do n't mind their listening to it . But I do n't talk that way ordinarily . " " Nobody thinks you do . " She gave me a quick peck . " But you did so when it was needed and you made every woman in the company proud of you . And our men , too . " She did n't seem disposed to let go of me but the night nurse showed up then and told me firmly to go to bed and she was going to give me a sleepytime shot  --  I made only the usual formal protest . The clerk said , " Hi , Goldie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goldie ( not her name  --  bottle blonde ) said , " Want it in your arm ? Or in your leg ? Do n't mind Anna ; she 's harmless . " " She 's all right . " It occurred to me that Goldie probably could monitor both sight and sound . Probably ? Certainly ! " Were you there ? At the farm ? When the house was burned ? " " Not while the house was burning . I was in an APV , taking you here as fast as we could float it . You were a sad sight , Miss Friday . " " I 'll bet I was . Thanks . Goldie ? Will you kiss me good-night ? " Her kiss was warm and undemanding . I found out later that she was one of the four who made the run upstairs to grab me back  --  one man carrying big bolt cutters , two armed and firing . . . and Goldie carrying unassisted a stretcher basket . But she never mentioned it , then or later . I remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vacations in Christchurch  --  when I was quietly , warmly happy , every day , every night . Why ? Because I belonged ! Of course , as anyone could guess from this account , I had passed years earlier . I no longer carried an ID with a big " LA " ( or even " AP " ) printed across it . I could walk into a washroom and not be told to use the end stall . But a phony ID and a fake family  | tree do not keep you warm ; they just keep you from being hassled and discriminated against . You are still aware that there is n't any nation anywhere that considers your sort fit for citizenship and there are lots of places that would deport you or even kill you  --  or sell you  --  if your cover-up ever slipped . An artificial person misses not having a family tree much more than you might think . Where were you born ? Well , I was n't born , exactly ; I was designed in Tri-University Life Engineering Laboratory , Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendelian Associates , Zurich . Wonderful small talk , that ! You 'll never hear it ; it does not stand up well against ancestors on the Mayflower or in the Domesday Book . My records ( or one set ) show that I was " born " in Seattle , a destroyed city being a swell place for missing records . A great place to lose your next of kin , too . Since I was never in Seattle I have studied very carefully all the records and pictures I could find ; an honest-to-goodness native of Seattle ca n't trip me . I think . Or not yet . But what they gave me while I was recovering from that silly rape and the not-so-funny interrogation was not phony at all and I did not have to worry about keeping my lies straight . Not just Goldie and Anna and the youngster ( Terence ) but over two dozen more before Dr. Krasny discharged me . Those were just the ones I came into contact with . There were more on that raid ; I do n't know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization from meeting each other save when their duties necessarily brought them together . Just as he firmly snubbed questions . You can not let slip secrets you do not know , and you can not betray a person whose very existence is unknown to you . But Boss did not have rules just for the sake of rules . Once hav ing met a colleague through duty one could continue the contact socially . Boss did not encourage such fraternizing but he was no fool and did not try to forbid it . In consequence Anna often called on me in the late evening just before she went on duty . She never did try to collect her pound of flesh . There was n't much opportunity but we could have found one if we had tried . I did n't try to discourage her  --  hell , no ; if she had ever presented the bill for collection , I would not only have paid cheerfully but would have tried to convince her that it was my idea in the first place . But she did n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare ) male who never paws a woman when she does n't want to be pawed  --  he can sense it and does n't start . One evening shortly before my discharge I was feeling especially happy  --  I had acquired two new friends that day ; " kissing friends , " persons who had fought in the raid that saved me  --  and I tried to explain to Anna why it meant so much to me and found that I was starting to tell her how I was not quite what I seemed to be . She stopped me . " Friday dear , listen to your big sister . " " Huh ? Did I goof ? " " Maybe you were about to . ' Member the night we met , you returned through me a classified document ? I have supreme topsecret clearance awarded to me by Mr. Two-Canes years back . That book you returned is where I can get at it anytime . But I have never opened it and never will . The cover says Need to Know ' and I have never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it but I do n't know even the title or the subject  --  just its number . " Personnel matters are like that . There used to be an elite military outfit , a foreign legion , that boasted that a legionnaire had no history before the day of his enlistment . Mr. Two-Canes wants us to be like that . For example , if we were to recruit a living artifact , an artificial person , the personnel clerk would know it . I know , as I used to be personnel clerk . Records to forge , possibly some plastic surgery needed , in some cases laboratory identifications to excise and then regenerate the area ... . " When we got through with him , he would never again have to worry about a tap on the shoulder or being elbowed out of a queue . He could even marry and have children without worrying that someday it might cause trouble for his kids . He would n't have to worry about me , either , as I have a trained forgettery . Now , dear , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , if it is something you do n't ordinarily tell people , do n't tell me . Or you 'll hate yourself in the morning . " " No , I would n't ! " " All right . If you still want to tell me a week from now , I 'll listen . A deal ? " Anna was right ; a week later I felt no need to tell her . I 'm 99 percent certain that she knew . Either way , it 's swell to be loved for yourself alone , by somebody who does n't think that APs are monsters , subhuman . I do n't know that any of the rest of my loving friends knew or  | guessed . ( I do n't mean Boss ; he knew , of course . But he was n't a friend ; he was Boss . ) It did not matter if my new friends learned that I was n't human ; because I had come to realize that they either did n't care or would n't care . All that mattered to them was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One evening Boss showed up , tapping his canes and whuffling , with Goldie trailing him . He settled heavily into the visitor 's chair , said to Goldie , " I wo n't need you , nurse . Thank you " ? then to me , " Take off your clothes . " From any other man that would be either offensive or welcome , depending . From Boss it merely meant that he wanted my clothes off . Goldie took it that way , too , as she simply nodded and left ? and Goldie is the sort of professional who would buck Siva the Destroyer if He attempted to interfere with one of her patients . I took my clothes off quickly and waited . He looked me up and down . " They again match . " " Seems so to me . " " Dr. Krasny says that he ran a test for lactation function . Positive . " " Yes .

Tomorrow morning you leave for refresher training . Be packed and ready by oh-nine hundred . " " Since I arrived without even a happy smile , packing will take me eleven seconds .

" " Hully gee , Great White Father . I abase myself . And I 'll send you a picture postcard from Wellington . " " Of a pretty Maori , please ; I 've seen a geyser . Your refresher course will be tailored to fit your needs and you will decide when it is complete . Although you are wellest , ' you need physical training of carefully increasing difficulty to get you back into that superb pitch of muscle tone and wind and reflex that is your birthright . " " Birthright : Do n't make jokes , Boss ; you have no talent for it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife . " " You are being foolishly self-conscious over an impediment that was removed years ago .

' The records concerning your origin have been removed from the production laboratory 's files , and a dummy set concerning an enhanced male AP was substituted . " " You never told me that ! " " Until you displayed this neurotic weakness , I saw no need . But 1111 a deception of that nature should be made so airtight that it will utterly displace the truth . And so it has .

But , my dear , why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve , you are an enhanced human , as 1 near perfect as your designers could manage . Why do you think I went out of my way to recruit you when you had no experience and no conscious interest in this profession ? Why did I spend a small fortune educating and training you ?

" ( I did n't try to tell him about the laboratory creche ; human people think all creches are like those they 've seen .

You will receive advanced training in hand weapons , including some you may never have heard of . If you change tracks , you will need this . " " Boss , I am not going to become an assassin ! " " You need it anyhow . There are times when a courier can carry weapons and she must have every edge possible . Friday , do n't despise assassins indiscriminately . As with any tool , merit or demerit lies in how it is used . The decline and fall of the former United States of North America derived in part from assassinations . But only in small part as the killings had no pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prussian-Russian War ? " " Not much . Mainly that the Prussians got their hides nailed to the barn when the smart money figured them for winners . " " Suppose I tell you that twelve people won that war  --  seven men , five women  --  and that the heaviest weapon used was a sixmillimeter pistol . " " I do n't think you have ever lied to me . How ? " " Friday , brainpower is the scarcest commodity and the only one of real value . Any human organization can be rendered useless , impotent , a danger to itself , by selectively removing its best minds while carefully leaving the stupid ones in place . It took only a few careful accidents ' to ruin utterly the great Prussian military machine and turn it into a blundering mob . But this did not show until the fighting was well under way , because stupid fools look just as good as military geniuses until the fighting starts . " " Only a dozen people  --  Boss ? Did we do that job ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did not . It was a contract job by an organization as small and as specialized as we are . But I do not willingly involve us in nationalistic wars ; the side of the angels is seldom self-evident . " " I still do n't want to be an assassin . " " I will not permit you to be an assassin and let us have no more discussion of it . Be ready to leave at nine tomorrow . "  | Nine weeks later I left for New Zealand . I 'll say this for Boss : The supercilious bully always knows what he 's talking about . When Dr. Krasny let me go , I was n't " wellest . " I was simply a recovered patient who no longer needed sickbed nursing . Nine weeks later I could have taken prizes in the old Olympics without working up a sweat . As I boarded the SB Abel Tasman at Winnipeg freeport , the skipper gave me the eye . I knew I looked good and I added a waggle to my seat that I would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to blend into the scenery . But now I was on leave and it 's kind of fun to advertise . Apparently I had n't forgotten how as the skipper came back to my cradle while I was still belting in . Or it may have been the Superskin jump suit that I was wearing  --  new that season and the first one I had had ; I bought the outfit at the freeport and changed into it in the shop . I 'm sure that it is only a matter of time until the sects that think that sex has something to do with sin will class wearing Superskin as a mortal sin . He said , " Miss Baldwin , is it not ? Do you have someone meeting you in Auckland ? What with the war and all it is not a good idea for an unescorted woman to be alone in an international port . " ( I did not say , " Look , Bub , the last time I killed the bloke . " ) The captain stood a hundred and ninety-five , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it fat . Early thirties and the sort of blond you expect in SAS rather than ANZAC . If he  | wanted to be protective I was willing to stand short . I answered , " Nobody 's meeting me but I 'm just changing for the South Island shuttle . How do these buckles work ? Uh , do those stripes mean you 're the captain ? " " Let me show you . Captain , yes  --  Captain Ian Tormey . " He started belting me in ; I let him . " Captain . Gollee ! I 've never met a captain before . " A remark like that is n't even a fib when it 's a ritual response in the ancient barnyard dance . He had said to me , " I 'm on the prowl and you look good . Are you interested ? " And I had answered , " You look acceptable but I 'm sorry to have to tell you that I do n't have time today . " At that point he could adjourn it with no hurt feelings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future encounter . He chose the latter . As he finished belting me in  --  tight enough but not too tight and not using the chance to grab a feel  --  quite professional  --  he said , " The timing on that connection will be close today . If you 'll + ' hang back when we disembark and be last out , I 'll be happy to put you aboard your Kiwi . That 'll be faster than finding your way through the crowds by yourself . " ( The connection timing is twenty-seven minutes , Captain ? leaving twenty minutes in which to talk me out of my comm signal . But keep on being sweet about it and I may give it to you . ) " Why , thank you , Captain ! ? if it 's really not too much trouble . " " ANZAC service , Miss Baldwin . But my pleasure . " I like to ride the semiballistics  --  the high-gee blastoff that always feels as if the cradle would rupture and spurt fluid all over the cabin , the breathless minutes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and then reentry and that long , long glide that beats any sky ride ever built . Where can you have more fun in forty minutes with your clothes on ? Then comes the always interesting question : Is the runway clear ? A semiballistic does n't make two passes ; it ca n't . It says right here in the brochure that an SB never lifts until it receives clearance from the port of reentry . Sure , sure , and I believe in the Tooth Fairy just like Boss 's parents . How about the dumbjohn in the private APV who picks the wrong strip and parks ? How about the time in Singapore when I sat in the Top Deck bar and watched three SBs land in nine minutes ? ? not , I  | concede , on the same strip , but on crossing strips ! Russian roulette . I 'll go on riding them ; I like them and my profession often calls for me to use them . But I hold my breath from touchdown to full stop . This trip was fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tiring . I hung back when we landed and , sure enough , my polite wolf was just coming out of the cockpit as I reached the exit . The flight attendant handed me my bag and Captain Tormey took it over my insincere protests . He took me to the shuttle gate , took charge of confirming my reservation and selecting my seat , then brushed past the Passengers Only sign and settled down beside me . " Too bad you 're leaving so quickly  --  too bad for me , that is . Under the rules I have to take three days turnaround . . . and I happen to be at loose ends this trip . My sister and her husband used to live here  --  but they 've moved to Sydney and I no longer have anyone to visit with . " ( I can just see you spending all your off time with your sister and your brother-in-law . ) " Oh , what a shame ! I know how you must feel . My family is in Christchurch and I 'm always lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , noisy , friendly family ? I married into an S-group . " ( Always tell them at once . ) " Oh , how jolly ! How many husbands do you have ? " " Captain , that is always the first thing men ask . It comes from misunderstanding the nature of an S-group . From thinking that S stands for ' sex . ' " " Does n't it ? " " Goodness , no ! It stands for security ' and siblings ' and ' sociability ' and sanctuary ' and succor ' and safety ' and lots of other things , all of them warm and sweet and comforting . Oh , it can stand for sex , ' too . But sex is readily available everywhere . No need to form anything as complex as an S-group just for sex . " ( S stands for " synthetic family " because that is how it was designated in the legislation of the first territorial nation , the California Confederacy , to legalize it . But it is ten-to-one that Captain Tormey knew this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salute . ) " I do n't find sex that readily available ? " ( I refused to answer his ploy . Captain , with your height and broad shoulders and pink , well-scrubbed look , and almost all of your time free for The Hunt . . . in Winnipeg and Auckland , fer  | Gossake , two places where the crop never fails . . . . Please , sir ! Try again. ) " ? but I agree with you that it is not reason enough to marry . I 'm not likely to marry , - ever . . . because I go where the wild goose goes . But an S-group sounds like a fine deal to come back to . " " It is . " " How big is it ? " " Still interested in my husbands ? I have three husbands , sir , and three group sisters to match . . . and I think you would like " all It Lispeth , our youngest and prettiest . Liz is a redheaded Scottish lassie and a bit of a flirt . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , but they move pretty fast . And kittens and ducks and puppy dogs and a big rambling garden with roses all year round , almost . It 's a busy happy place and always watch where you put your feet . " " Sounds grand . Does the group need an associate husband who ca n't be home much but carries loads of life insurance ? How much does it cost to buy in ? " " I 'll speak to Anita about it . But you do n't sound serious . " The chitchat continued , neither of us meaning a word of it , other than on a symbolic level . Shortly we declared it a draw while providing for a possible rematch by exchanging Comm codes , that of my family in Christchurch in answer to his offer to me of the casual use of his flat in Auckland . He had taken over the lease , he said , when his sister had moved . . . but he needed it only six days out of the month , usually . " So if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash-up and a nap , or overnight , just call . " " But suppose one of your friends is using it , Ian " ? he had asked me to drop calling him Captain ? " or yourself . " " Unlikely but , if so , the computer will know and tell you . If I 'm in town or about to be in town , it will tell you that , too  --  and I certainly would not want to miss you . " The pass direct , but in the politest terms . So I answered it by telling him , through giving him our Christchurch number , that he was welcome to try to get my pants off . . . if he had the guts to face my husbands , my co-wives , and a passel of noisy kids . I thought it most unlikely that he would call . Tall , handsome bachelors in glamorous , high-paying jobs do n't have to carry the anvil that far .  | About then the loudspeaker that mumbles the arrivals and departures interrupted itself with : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total destruction of Acapulco . This flash comes to you courtesy of Interworld Transport , Proprietary , the Triple-S Lines : Speed  --  Safety  --  Service . " I gasped . Captain Ian said , " Oh , those idiots ! " " Which idiots ? " " The whole Mexican Revolutionary Kingdom . When are the territorial states going to learn that they can not possibly win against corporate states ? That 's why I said they were idiots . And they are ! " " Why do you say that , Captain ? ? Ian ? " " Obvious . Any territorial state , even if it 's Ell-Four or an asteroid , is a sitting duck . But fighting a multinational is like trying to slice a fog . Where 's your target ? You want to fight IBM ? Where is IBM ? Its registered home office is a P.O. box number in Delaware Free State . That 's no target . IBM 's offices and people and plants are scattered through four hundred  --  odd territorial states groundside and more in space ; you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much or more . But can IBM defeat , say , Great Russia ? " " I do n't know , " I admitted . " The Prussians were n't able to . " " It would just depend on whether or not IBM could see a profit in it . So far as I know , IBM does n't own any guerrillas ; she may not even have agents saboteurs . She might have to buy the bombs and missiles . But she could shop around and take her own sweet time getting set because Russia is n't going anywhere . It will I'I still be there , a big fat target , a week from now or a year . But In- terworld Transport just showed what the outcome would be . This war is all over . Mexico bet that Interworld would n't risk public condemnation by destroying a Mexican city . But those old-style politicians forgot that corporate nations are n't nearly as interested in public opinion as territorial nations have to be . The war 's over . " " Oh , I hope so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , and it would still be a beautiful place if the Montezuma 's i II Revolutionary Council was n't rooted somewhere back in the twentieth century . But now there will be face-saving . Interworld will apologize and pay an indemnity , then , with no fanfare , the Montezuma will cede the land and the extraterritoriality for the new spaceport to a new corporation with a Mexicano name and a  | DF home office . . . and the public wo n't be told that the new corporation is owned sixty percent by Interworld and forty percent by the very politicians who stalled just a little too long and let Acapulco be destroyed . " Captain Tormey looked sour and I suddenly saw that he was older than I had first guessed . I said , " Ian , is n't ANZAC a subsidiary of Interworld ? " " Perhaps that 's why I sound so cynical . " He stood up . " Your shuttle is locking into the gate . Let me have your bag . "  | Christchurch is the loveliest city on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not yet a truly lovely city off Earth . Luna City is underground , Ell-Five looks like a junkyard from outside and has only one arc that looks good from inside . 1111 Martian cities are mere hives and most Earthside cities suffer from a misguided attempt to look like Los Angeles . Christchurch does not have the magnificence of Paris or the setting of San Francisco or the harbor of Rio . Instead it has things that make a city lovable rather than stunning : The gentle Avon , lo winding through our downtown streets . The mellow beauty of Cathedral Square . The Ferrier fountain in front of Town Hall . The lush beauty of our world-famous botanic gardens smack in the middle of downtown . " The Greeks praise Athens . " But I am not a native of Christchurch ( if " native " could mean anything for my sort ) . I am not even an Ennzedd . I met Douglas in Ecuador ( this was before the Quito Skyhook catastrophe ) , was delighted by a frantic love affair compounded of equal parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his proposal , calmed down when he made me understand that he was not then proposing vows in front of some V 1 official but a trial visit to his S-group  --  find out if they liked me , find out if I liked them . That was different . I zipped back to the Imperium and reported , and told Boss that I was taking some accumulated leave ? or would he rather have my resignation ? He growled something about go ahead and get my gonads cooled off , then report in when  | I was fit to work . So I rushed back to Quito and Douglas was still in bed . At that time there really was n't any way to get from Ecuador to New Zealand . . . so we tubed to Lima and took an SB right over the South Pole to West Australia Port at Perth ( with the oddest S-shaped track because of Coriolis ) ? tube to Sydney , bounce to Auckland , float to Christchurch , taking nearly twenty-four hours and the wildest of tracks just to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Auckland  --  do n't be fooled by a flat map ; ask your computer  --  Winnipeg is only oneeighth farther . Forty minutes versus twenty-four hours . But I had not minded the longer trip ; I was with Douglas and dizzy in love . In another twenty-four hours I was dizzy in love with his family . I had n't expected that . I had looked forward to a lovely vacation with Douglas and he had promised me some skiing as well as sex  --  not that I insisted on skiing . I knew that I had an implied obligation to go to bed with his group brothers if asked . But that did n't worry me because an artificial person simply ca n't take copulation as seriously as most humans seem to take it . Most of the females of my creche class had been trained as doxies from menarche on and then were signed up as company women with one or another of the construction multinationals . I myself had received basic doxy training before Boss showed up , bought my contract , and changed my track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several months  --  but that 's another story . ) But I would n't have been jumpy about friendly sex even if I had received no doxy training at all ; such nonsense is n't tolerated in APs ; we never learn it . But we never learn anything about being in a family . The very first day I was there I made us all late for tea by rolling on the floor with seven youngsters ranging from eleven down to a nappywetter . . . plus two or three dogs and a young tomcat who had earned the name Mister Underfoot through his unusual talent for occupying all of a large floor . I had never experienced anything like that in all my life . I did n't want to stop . Brian , not Douglas , took me skiing . The ski lodges at Mount Hutt are lovely but the bedrooms are n't heated after twenty-two and you have to snuggle up close to keep warm . Then Vickie took  | me out to see the family 's sheep and I met socially an enhanced dog who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord had a low opinion of the good sense of sheep , in which he was , I think , fully justified . Bertie took me to Milford Sound via shuttle to Dunedin ( the " Edinburgh of the South " ) and overnight there  --  Dunedin is swell but it 's not Christchurch . We took a flubsy little steamer there around to the fjord country , one with tiny little cabins big enough for two only because it 's cold down at the south end of the island and again I snuggled up close . There is n't any other fjord anywhere that can compare with Milford Sound . Yes , I 've been on the Lofoten Islands trip . Very nice . But my mind 's made up . If you think I am as blindly pigheaded about South Island as a mother is about her firstborn , that is simply because it 's true ; I am . North Island is a fine place , with its thermal displays and the world wonder of the Glowworm Caves . And the Bay of Islands looks like Fairyland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't have Christchurch . Douglas took me to see their creamery and I saw huge tubs of beautiful butter being packed . Anita introduced me to the Altar Guild . I began to realize that , maybe , just possibly , I might be invited to make it permanent . And found that I had shifted from **34;295;TOOLONG to **39;331;TOOLONG and then simply to Oh-God-what'll-I-do ? You see , I had never told Douglas that I am not human . I 've heard humans boast that they can spot an artificial person every time . Nonsense . Of course anyone can pick out a living artifact that does not conform to human appearance  --  say a man creature with four arms or a kobold dwarf . But if the genetic designers have intentionally restricted themselves to human appearance ( this being the technical definition of " artificial person " rather than " living artifact " ) , no human can tell the difference  --  no , not even another genetic engineer . I am immune to cancer and to most infections . But I do n't wear a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't show them off by picking a fly out of the air with thumb and forefinger . I never compete with other people in games of dexterity . I have unusual memory , unusual innate grasp of number and space and relationship , unusual skill at languages . But , if you think that defines a genius IQ , let me add that , in the school I  | was trained in , the object of an IQ test is to hit precisely a predetermined score  --  not to show off your smarts . In public nobody 's going to catch me being smarter than those around me . . . unless it 's an emergency involving either my mission or my neck or both . The complex of these enhancements and others is reliably reported to improve sexual performance but , fortunately , most males are inclined to regard any noticeable improvement in this area as simply a reflection of their own excellence . ( Properly regarded , male vanity is a virtue , not a vice . Treated correctly , it makes him enormously pleasanter to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total lack of vanity . No way to get a handle on him ! ) I was not afraid that I would be caught out . With all production laboratory identification removed from my body , even the tattoo that was on the roof of my mouth , there is simply no way to tell that I was designed rather than conceived through the bio roulette of a billion sperm competing blindly for one ovum . But a wife in the S-group was expected to add to that swarm of kids on the floor . Well , why not ? Lots of reasons . I was a combat courier in a quasi-military organization . Picture me trying to cope with a sudden attack while pushing an eightmonths belly ahead of me . We AP females are released or marketed in a reversible sterile condition . To an artificial person the yen to have babies  --  grow them inside your body  --  does n't seem " natural " ; it seems ridiculous . In vitro seems so much more reasonable  --  and neater , and more convenient  --  than in vivo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever saw a pregnant woman near term  --  and I thought she was deathly ill . When I found out what was wrong with her , it made me sort of sick to my stomach . When I thought about it a long time later in Christchurch , it still made me queasy . Do it like a cat , with blood and pain fer Gossake ? Why ? And why do it at all ? Despite the way we are filling up the sky , this giddy globe has far too many people on it  --  why make it worse ? I decided , most sorrowfully , that I was going to have to duck the issue of marriage by telling them that I was sterile  --  no babies . True enough if not all the truth . I was n't asked . Not about babies . For the next several days I reached out with  | both hands to enjoy family life as much as possible while I had it : the warm pleasure of woman talk while washing up after tea ; the rowdy fun of youngsters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these bathed every minute of my day in belonging . One morning Anita invited me out into the garden . I thanked her while pointing out that I was busy helping Vickie . Whereupon I was overruled and found myself seated at the far end of the garden with Anita , and children firmly shooed away . Anita said , " Marjorie dear " ? I 'm " Marjorie Baldwin " in Christchurch because that was my public name when I met Douglas in Quito ? " we both know why Douglas invited you here . Are you happy with us ? " " Terribly happy ! " " Happy enough , do you think , to wish to make it permanent ? " " Yes but ? " I never had a chance to say Yes-but-I'm-sterile ; Anita firmly cut me off . " Perhaps I had better say some things first , dear . We must discuss dowry . If I left it up to our men , money would never be mentioned ; Albert and Brian are as dotty about you as Douglas is , and I quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation as well as a marriage , and someone must keep an eye on the bookkeeping ... and that is why I am chairman of the board and chief executive ; I never become so emotional that I fail to watch our businesses . " She smiled and her knitting needles clicked . " Ask Brian  --  he calls me Ebenezer Scrooge  --  but he has n't offered to take over the worries himself . " You can stay with us as a guest as long as you like . What 's one more mouth to feed at a table as long as ours ? Nothing . But if you want to join us formally and contractually , then I must become Ebenezer Scrooge and discover what contract we can write . For I wo n't let the family fortunes be watered down . Brian owns and votes three shares , Albert and I each own and vote two shares , Douglas and Victoria and Lispeth have one each and vote it . As you can see , I have only two votes out of ten . . . but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly receive a strong vote of confidence . Someday I 'll be overruled and then I can quit and be Alice Sit-by-the-Fire . " ( And the funeral will be later that same day ! ) " Meanwhile I cope . The children each have one nonvoting  | share .. and a child never does vote his share because it is paid to him or her in cash on leaving home , as dowry or as starting capital  --  or wasted although I like to think not . Such reductions in capital must be planned ; were three of our girls to marry in the same year the situation could be embarrassing if not anticipated . " I told her that it sounded like a very sensible and warm arrangement as I did n't think that most children were so carefully provided for . ( In fact I did n't know anything at all about such things . ) " We try to do right by them , " she agreed . " After all , children are the purpose of a family . So I 'm sure that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share , or the system wo n't work . Marriages are arranged in heaven but the bills must be paid here on earth . " " Amen . " ( I could see that my problems were solved for me . Negatively . I could not estimate the wealth of the Davidson Group Family . Wealthy , that was certain , even though they lived with no servants in an old-fashioned unautomated house . Whatever it was , I could not buy a share . ) " Douglas told us that he had no idea whether you had money or not . Money in capital amounts , I mean . " " I do n't . " She never dropped a stitch . " Nor did I when I was your age . You are employed , are you not ? Could n't you work in Christchurch and buy your share out of your salary ? I know that finding work can be a problem in a strange city . . . but I am not without connections . What do you do ? You 've never told us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evading her and then telling her bluntly that my work was confidential and I refused to discuss any aspect of my employer 's business but , no , I could n't leave and look for work in Christchurch , so there was n't any way it could work but it had certainly been wonderful while it had lasted and I hoped She chopped me off . " My dear , I was not empowered to negotiate this contract for the purpose of failing . Why it ca n't be done is not acceptable ; I must discover how it can be done . Brian has offered to give you one of his three shares . . . and Douglas and Albert are backing him , pro rata , although they ca n't pay him at once . But I vetoed the whole scheme ; it is a bad precedent and I told them so , using a crude old country expression about rams in  | the spring . Instead I am accepting one of Brian 's shares as security against your performance of your contract . " " But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you continue your present employment , how much can you pay per month ? Do n't pinch yourself but do pay off as quickly as possible as it works just like an amortized real-estate purchase : Part of each payment services the remaining debt , part reduces that debt  --  so the larger the payment the better , for you . " ( I had never bought any real estate . ) " Can we figure that in gold ? I can convert into any money , of course , but I get paid in gold . " " In gold ? " Anita suddenly looked alert . She reached into her knitting bag and pulled out a portable relay to her computer terminal . " I can offer you a better deal for gold . " She punched for a while , waited , and nodded . " Considerably better . Although I 'm not really set up to handle bullion . But arrangements can be made . " " I said I can convert . The drafts are for grams , three nines fine , drawn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it can be paid in New Zealand money , right here , by automatic bank deposit even when I 'm not on Earth at the time . Bank of New Zealand , Christchurch office ? " " Uh , Canterbury Land Bank . I 'm a director there . " " By all means keep it in the family . " The next day we signed the contract and later that week they married me , all legal and proper , in a side chapel of the cathedral , with me in white , fer Gossake . The following week I went back to work , both sad and warmly happy . For the next seventeen years I would be paying NZ$858.13 per month , or I could pay it faster . For what ? I could not live at home until it was all paid because I had to keep my job to meet those monthly payments . For what , then ? Not for sex . As I told Captain Tormey , sex is everywhere ; it 's silly to pay for it . For the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the privilege of rolling around on the floor and being peed on by puppies and babies only nominally housebroken . For the warm knowledge that , wherever I was , there was a place on this planet where I could do these things as a matter of right , because I belonged . It seemed like a bargain to me.  | As soon as the shuttle floated off , I phoned ahead , got Vickie , and , once she stopped squealing , gave her my ETA . I had intended to call from the Kiwi Lines lounge in Auckland port but my curly wolf , Captain Ian , had used up the time . No matter ? although the shuttle floats just short of the speed of sound , a stop at Wellington and a stop at Nelson uses up enough time that I thought someone would meet me . I hoped so . Everybody met me . Well , not quite everybody . We 're licensed to own an APV because we raise sheep and cattle and need power transportation . But we are n't supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working majority of our big family was spilling out the sides of that big farm floatwagon . Most of a year since my last visit home , over twice as long as any such period earlier  --  bad . Children can grow away from you in that length of time . I was most careful about names and made sure that I checked off everyone in my mind . All present save Ellen , who was hardly a child  --  eleven when they married me , she was a young lady now , university age . Anita and Lispeth were at home , hurrying together my welcome-home feast . . . and again I would be gently scolded for not having given them warning and again I would try to explain that , in my work , once I was free to leave , it was better to grab the first SB than it was to try to get a call through  --  did I need an appointment to come to my own home ? Shortly I was down on the floor with kids all around me . Mister Underfoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waited for opportunity to greet me with dignity befitting his status as senior cat , elderly , fat , and slow . He looked me over carefully , brushed against me , and buzzed . I was home . After a time I asked , " Where is Ellen ? Still in Auckland ? I thought university was closed for vacation now . " I looked right at Anita when I said this but she appeared not to hear me . Getting hard of hearing ? Surely not . " Marjie ? " Brian 's voice  --  I looked around . He did not speak and his face held no expression . He barely shook his head . ( Ellen a taboo topic ? What is this , Brian ? I tabled it until I could speak to him privately . Anita has always maintained that she loves all our children equally , whether they are her own bio children or not . Oh , certainly ! Save that her special interest in  | Ellen was always clear to everyone within reach of her voice . ) Later that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about to go to bed ( under some lottery system in which our teasing darlings always insisted that the loser had to spend the night with me ) , Brian tapped at the door and came in . Bertie said , " It 's all right . You can leave . I can take my punishment . " " Stow it , Bert . Have you told Marj about Ellen ? " " Not yet . " " Then fill her in . Sweetheart , Ellen got married without Anita 's blessing . . . and Anita is furious about it . So it 's best not to mention Ellen around Anita . Verb . sap. , eh ? Now I must run before she misses me . " " Are n't you permitted to come kiss me good-night ? Or to stay here for that matter ? Are n't you my husband , too ? " " Yes , of course , dear . But Anita is touchy as can be at present and there is no point in getting her stirred up . " Brian kissed us good-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bertie ? Why should n't Ellen marry anyone she wishes to marry ? She is old enough to make her own decisions . " " Well , yes . But Ellen did n't use good judgment about it . She 's married a Tongan and she 's gone to live in Nuku'alofa . " " Does Anita feel that they should live here ? In Christchurch ? " " Eh ? No , no ! It 's the marriage she objects to . " " Is there something wrong with this man ? " " Marjorie , did n't you hear me ? He 's a Tongan . " " Yes , I heard . Since he lives in Nuku'alofa , I would expect him to be . Ellen is going to find it awfully hot there , after being brought up in one of the few perfect climates . But that is her problem . I still do n't see why Anita is upset . There must be something I do n't know . " " Oh , but you do ! Well , maybe you do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ; they are barbarians . " " Oh , but they 're not ! " I sat up in bed , thereby putting a stop to what had n't really started . Sex and arguments do n't mix . Not for me , anyway . " They are the most civilized people in all Polynesia . Why do you think the early explorers called that group the Friendly Isles ' ? Have you ever been there , Bertie ? " " No but ? "  | " I have . Aside from the heat it 's a heavenly place . Wait till you see it . This man ? ' What does he do ? If he simply sits and carves mahogany for the tourists , I could understand Anita 's unease . Is that it ? " " No . But I doubt that he can afford a wife . And Ellen ca n't afford a husband ; she did n't finish her degree . He 's a marine biologist . " " I see . He 's not rich . . . and Anita respects money . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably wind up a professor at Auckland or Sydney . Although a biologist can get rich , today . He may design a new plant or animal that will make him fabulously wealthy . " " Darling , you still do n't understand . " " Indeed I do n't . So tell me . " " Well . . . Ellen should have married one of her own kind . " " What do you mean by that , Albert ? Someone living in Christ-church ? " " It would help . " " Wealthy ? " " Not a requirement . Although things are usually smoother if financial affairs are n't too one-sided . Polynesian beach boy marries white heiress always has a stink to it . " " Oh , oh ! He 's penniless and she has just collected her family share  --  right ? " " No , not exactly . Damn it , why could n't she have married a white man ? We brought her up better than that . " " Bertie , what in the world ? You sound like a Dane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was free of that sort of thing . I remember Brian pointing out to me that the Maori were the political and social equals of the English in all respects . " " And they are . It 's not the same thing . " " I guess I 'm stupid . " ( Or was Bertie stupid ? Maori are Polynesians , so are Tongans  --  what 's the ache ? ) I dropped the matter . I had not come all the way from Winnipeg to debate the merits of a son-in-law I had never seen . " Sonin-law ... " What an odd idea . It always delighted me when one of the little ' uns called me Mama rather than Malik  --  but I had never thought about the possibility of ever having a son-in-law . And yet he was indeed my son-in-law under Ennzedd law  --  and I did n't even know his name !  | I kept quiet , tried to make my mind blank , and let Bertie devote himself to making me feel welcome . He 's good at that . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to be home , the unwelcome interruption forgotten .  | The next morning , before I was out of bed , I resolved not to open the subject of Ellen and her husband , but wait until someone else brought it up . After all , I was in no position to have opinions until I knew all about it . I was not going to drop it  --  Ellen is my daughter , too . But do n't rush it . Wait for Anita to calm down . But the subject did not come up . There followed lazy , golden days that I sha n't describe as I do n't think you are interested in birthday parties or family picnics  --  precious to me , dull to an outsider . Vickie and I went to Auckland on an overnight shopping trip . After we checked into the Tasman Palace , Vickie said to me , " Marj , would you keep a secret for me ? " " Certainly , " I agreed . " Something juicy , I hope . A boyfriend ? Two boyfriends ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply split him with you . This is touchier . I want to talk to Ellen and I do n't want to have an argument with Anita about it . This is the first chance I 've had . Can you forget I did it ? " " Not quite , because I want to talk to her myself . But I wo n't tell Anita that you talked to Ellen if you do n't wish me to . What is this , Vick ? That Anita was annoyed about Ellen 's marriage I knew  --  but does she expect the rest of us not even to talk to Ellen ? Our own daughter ? " " I 'm afraid it 's her own daughter ' right now . She 's not being very rational about it . " " It sounds that way . Well , I will not let Anita cut me off from  | Ellen . I would have called her before this but I did not know how ' ll , 111 III to reach her . " " I 'll show you . I 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hold it ! " I interrupted . " Do n't touch that terminal . You do n't want Anita to know . " " I said so . That 's why I 'm calling from here . " " And the call will be included in our hotel bill and you 'll pay the bill with your Davidson credit card and ? Does Anita still check every bill that comes into the house ? " " She does . Oh , Marj , I 'm stupid . " " No , you 're honest . Anita wo n't object to the cost but she 's certain to notice a code or a printout that means an overseas call . We 'll slide over to the G.P.O. and make the call there . Pay cash . Or , easier yet , we 'll use my credit card , which does not bill to Anita . " " Of course ! Marj , you would make a good spy . " " Not me ; that 's dangerous . I got my practice dodging my mother . Let 's pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vickie , what is this about Ellen 's husband ? Does he have two heads or what ? " " Uh , he 's a Tongan . Or did you know ? " " Certainly I knew . But Tongan ' is not a disease . And it 's Ellen 's business . Her problem , if it is one . I ca n't see that it is . " " Uh , Anita has handled it badly . Once it 's done , the only thing to do is to put the best face on it possible . But a mixed marriage is always unfortunate , I think  --  especially if the girl is the one marrying below herself , as in Ellen 's case . " " ' Below herself ! ' All I 've been told is that he 's a Tongan . Tongans are tall , handsome , hospitable , and about as brown as I am . In appearance they ca n't be distinguished from Maori . What if this young man had been Maori . . . of good family , from an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Truly , I do n't think Anita would have liked it , Marj  --  but she would have gone to the wedding and given the reception . Intermarriage with Maori has long precedent behind it ; one must accept it . But one need not like it . Mixing the races is always a bad idea . " ( Vickie , Vickie , do you know of a better idea for getting the world out of the mess it is in ? ) " So ? Vickie , this built-in suntan of mine  --  you know where I got it ? " " Certainly , you told us . Amerindian . Uh , Cherokee , you said .  | Marj ! Did I hurt your feelings ? Oh , dear ! It 's not like that at all ! Everybody knows that Amerindians are ? Well , just like white people . Every bit as good . " ( Oh , sure , sure ! And " some of my best friends are Jews . " But I 'm not Cherokee , so far as I know . Dear little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am an AP ? I 'm tempted to .. , but I must not shock you . ) " No , because I considered the source . You do n't know any better . You 've never been anywhere and you probably soaked up racism with your mother 's milk . " Vickie turned red . " That 's most unfair ! Marj , when you were up for membership in the family I stuck up for you . I voted for you . " " I was under the impression that everyone had . Or I would not have joined . Do I understand that my Cherokee blood was an issue in that discussion ? " " Well . . . it was mentioned . " " By whom and to what effect ? " " Uh ? Marjie , those are executive sessions , they have to be . I ca n't talk about them . " " Mmm , I see your point . Was there an executive session over Ellen ? If so , you should be free to talk to me about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote . " " There was n't one . Anita said that it was n't necessary . She said that she did not believe in encouraging fortune hunters . Since she had already told Ellen that she could not bring Tom home to meet the family , there did n't seem to be anything to be done . " " Did n't any of you stand up for Ellen ? Did you do so , Vickie ? " Vickie turned red again . " It would simply have made Anita furious . " " I 'm getting kind of furious myself . By our family code Ellen is your daughter and my daughter quite as much as she is Anita 's daughter , and Anita is wrong in refusing Ellen permission to bring her new husband home without consulting the rest of us . " " Marj , it was n't quite that way . Ellen wanted to bring Tom home for a visit . Uh , an inspection visit . You know . " " Oh . Yes , having been under the microscope myself , I do know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a bad marriage . The first the rest of us new about it Ellen was married . Ap- parently Ellen went right straight out and got married the minute she got Anita 's letter telling her no . " " Be damned ! A light begins to dawn . Ellen trumped Anita 's ace by getting married at once  --  and that meant that Anita had to pay out cash equal to one family corporation share with no notice . Could be difficult . It 's quite a chunk of money . It is taking me years and years to pay for my share . " " No , it 's not that . Anita is simply angry because her daughter ? her favorite ; we all know that  --  has married a man she disapproves of . Anita has n't had to scrape up that much cash because it was n't necessary . There is no contractual obligation to pay out a share ... and Anita pointed out that there was no moral obligation to siphon off the family 's capital to benefit an adventurer . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble believing my ears . What sort of spineless worms are the rest of you to allow Ellen to be treated this way ? " I took a deep breath and tried to control my fury . " I do n't understand you . Any of you . But I 'm going to try to set a good example . When we get home I 'm going to do two things . First I 'm going to the family-room terminal when everybody is there and phone Ellen and invite her and her husband home for a visit  --  come for the next weekend because I 've got to get back to work and do n't want to miss meeting my new son-in-law . " " Anita will burst a blood vessel . " " We 'll see . Then I 'm going to call for a family meeting and move that Ellen 's share be paid to her with all orderly haste consonant with conserving assets . " I added , " I assume that Anita will be furious again . " " Probably . To no purpose , as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this ? Things are bad enough now . " " Maybe . But it 's possible that some of you have just been waiting for someone else to take the lead in bucking Anita 's tyranny . At least I 'll find out how the vote goes . Vick , under the contract I signed I have paid more than seventy thousand Ennzedd dollars into the family and I was told that the reason I had to buy my way into a marriage was that each of our many children were to be paid a full share on leaving home . I did n't protest ; I signed . But there is an implied contract there no matter what Anita says . If Ellen ca n't be paid today , then I shall insist that my monthly payments go to Ellen until such time as Anita can shake loose the  | rest of one share to pay Ellen off . Does that strike you as equi-table ? " She was slow in answering . " Marj , I do n't know . I have n't had time to think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday , you are going to have to fish or cut bait . I shall not let Ellen be mistreated any further . " I grinned and added , " Smile ! Let 's slide over to the post office and be sunny-side-up for Ellen . " But we did n't go to the G.P.O. ; we did n't call Ellen at all that trip . Instead we proceeded to drink our dinner and argue . I 'm not sure just how the subject of artificial persons got into the discussion . I think it was while Vickie was " proving " still another time how free she was from racial prejudice while exhibiting that irrational attitude every time she opened her mouth . Maori were just dandy and of course American Indians were and Hindu Indians for that matter and the Chinese had certainly produced their quota of geniuses ; everybody knew that , but you had to draw the line somewhere ... . We had gone to bed and I was trying to tune out her drivel when something hit me . I raised up . " How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You said , Of course no one would marry an artifact . ' How would you know that a person was artificial ? Not all of them carry serial numbers . " " Huh ? Why , Marjie , do n't be silly . A manufactured creature ca n't be mistaken for a human being . If you had ever seen one ? " " I 've seen one . I 've seen many ! " " Then you know . " " Then I know what ? " " That you can tell one of those monsters just by looking at it . " " How ? What are these stigmata that mark off an artificial person from any other person ? Name one ! " " Marjorie , you 're being dreadfully difficult just to be annoying ! This is not like you , dear . You 're turning our holiday into something unpleasant . " " Not me , Vick . You are . By saying silly , stupid , unpleasant things without a shred of evidence to back them up . " ( And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a superman , as that is exactly the sort of factually truthful remark that is much too cruel to use in a family discussion . ) " Oh ! How wicked ! How untruthful ! "  | What I did next ca n't be attributed to loyalty to other artificial persons because APs do n't feel group loyalty . No basis for it . I 've heard that Frenchmen will die for La Belle France  --  but can you imagine anyone fighting and dying for Homunculi Unlimited , Pty. , South Jersey Section ? I suppose I did it for myself although , like many of the critical decisions in my life , I have never been able to analyze why I did it . Boss says that I do all of my important thinking on the unconscious level . He may be right . I got out of bed , whipped off my gown , stood in front of her . " Look me over , " I demanded . " Am I an artificial person ? Or not ? Either way , how do you tell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows you have the best figure in the family ; you do n't have to prove it . " " Answer me ! Tell me which I am and tell me how you know . Use any test . Take samples for laboratory analysis . But tell me which I am and what signs prove it . " " You 're a naughty girl , that 's what you are . " " Possibly . Probably . But which sort ? Natural ? Or artificial ? " " Oh , bosh ! Natural , of course . " " Wrong . I 'm artificial . " " Oh , stop being silly ! Put your nightgown on and come back to bed . " Instead I badgered her with it , telling her what laboratory had designed me , the date I had been removed from the surrogate womb  --  my " birthday , " although we APs are " cooked " a little longer to speed up maturing  --  forced her to listen to a description of life in a production laboratory creche . ( Correction : Life in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . ) I gave her a summary of my life after I left the creche  --  mostly lies , as I could not compromise Boss 's secrets ; I simply repeated what I had long since told the family , that I was a confidential commercial traveler . I did n't need to mention Boss because Anita had decided years back that I was an envoy of a multinational , the sort of diplomat who always travels anonymously  --  an understandable error that I was happy to encourage by never denying it . Vickie said , " Marjie , I wish you would n't do this . A string of lies like that could endanger your immortal soul . " " I do n't have a soul . That 's what I 've been telling you . " " Oh , stop it ! You were born in Seattle . Your father was an electronics engineer ; your mother was a pediatrician . You lost them in  | the quake . You told us all about them  --  you showed us pictures . " " ' My mother was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vickie , there may be a million or more artificial people whose birth records ' were destroyed ' in the destruction of Seattle . No way to count them as their lies are never assembled . After what happened just this month there will start being lots of people of my sort who were bom ' in Acapulco . We have to find loopholes like that to avoid being persecuted by the ignorant and the prejudiced . " " Meaning I 'm ignorant and prejudiced ! " " Meaning you are a sweet girl who was fed a pack of lies by your elders . I 'm trying to correct that . But if the shoe fits , you can lie in it . " I shut up . Vickie did n't kiss me good-night . We were a long time getting to sleep . The next day each of us pretended that the argument had never taken place . Vickie did not mention Ellen ; I did not mention artificial persons . But it spoiled what had started out to be a merry outing . We got the shopping done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do as I had threatened  --  I did not call Ellen as soon as we were home . I did not forget Ellen ; I simply hoped that waiting awhile might mellow the situation . Cowardly , I suppose . Early the following week Brian invited me to go with him while he inspected a piece of land for a client . It was a long pleasant ride with lunch at a licensed country hotel  --  a fricassee billed as hogget although almost certainly mutton , washed down by tankards of mild . We ate out under the trees . After the sweet  --  a berry tart , quite good  --  Brian said , " Marjorie , Victoria came to me with a very odd story . " " So ? What was it ? " " My dear , please believe that I would not mention this were not Vickie so troubled by it . " He paused . I waited . " Upset by what , Brian ? " " She claims that you told her that you are a living artifact masquerading as a human being . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I told her that . Not in those words . " I did not add any explanation . Presently Brian said gently , " May I ask why ? " " Brian , Vickie was saying some very silly things about Tongans , and I was trying to make her see that they were both silly and wrong  --  that she was wronging Ellen by it . I am very much trou- bled about Ellen . The day I arrived home you shushed me about her , and I have kept quiet . But I ca n't keep quiet much longer . Brian , what are we going to do about Ellen ? She 's your daughter and mine ; we ca n't ignore how she is being mistreated . What shall we do ? " " I do not necessarily agree that something should be done , Marjorie . Please do n't change the subject . Vickie is quite unhappy . I am attempting to straighten out the misunderstanding . " I answered , " I have not changed the subject . Injustice to Ellen is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any respect in which Ellen 's husband is objectionable ? Other than prejudgment against him because he is Tongan ? " " None that I know of . Although , in my opinion , it was inconsiderate of Ellen to marry a man who had not even been introduced to her family . It does not show a decent respect for the people who have loved her and cared for her all her life . " " Wait a moment , Brian . As Vickie tells it , Ellen asked to bring him home for inspection  --  as I was brought home  --  and Anita refused to permit it . Whereupon Ellen married him . True ? " " Well , yes . But Ellen was headstrong and hasty . I do n't think she should have done so without talking to her other parents . I was quite hurt by it . " " Did she try to speak to you ? Did you make any attempt to talk to her ? " " Marjorie , by the time I knew of it , it was a fait accompli . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got home I have been hoping that someone would explain to me what happened . According to Vickie none of this was ever settled in family council . Anita refused to let Ellen bring her beloved home . The rest of Ellen 's parents either did not know or did not interfere with Anita 's , uh , cruelty . Yes , cruelty . Whereupon the child got married . Whereupon Anita compounded her initial cruelty by a grave injustice : She refused Ellen her birthright , her share of the family 's wealth . Is all this true ? " " Marjorie , you were not here . The rest of us  --  six out of seven ? acted as wisely as we could in a difficult situation . I do n't think it is proper of you to come along afterwards and criticize what we have done  --  upon my word , I do n't . " " Dear , I do n't mean to offend you . But my very point is that six of you have not done anything . Anita , acting alone , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unjust . . . and the rest of  | you stood aside and let her get away with it . No family decisions , just Anita 's decisions . If this is true , Brian  --  and correct me if I 'm wrong  --  then I feel compelled to ask for a full executive session of all husbands and wives to correct this cruelty by inviting Ellen and her husband to visit home , and to correct the injustice by paying to Ellen her fair share of the family 's wealth , or at least to acknowledge the debt if it ca n't be liquidated at once . Will you tell me your opinion of that ? " Brian drummed his nails on the tabletop . " Marjorie , that 's a simplistic view of a complex situation . Will you admit that I love Ellen and have her welfare in mind quite as much as you do ? " " Certainly , darling ! " " Thank you . I agree with you that Anita should not have refused to let Ellen bring her young man home . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own home , with its gentle ways and its traditions , she might well have decided that he was not for her . Anita stampeded Ellen into a foolish marriage ? and I have told her so . But the matter can not be immediately corrected by inviting them here . You can see that . Let 's agree that Anita should receive them warmly and graciously ... but it 's God 's own truth that she wo n't  --  if she has them shoved down her throat . " He grinned at me and I was forced to grin in return . Anita can be charming . . . and she can be incredibly cold , rude , if it suits her . Brian went on : " Instead , I 'll have reason to make a trip to Tonga in a couple of weeks and this will let me get well acquainted without having Anita at my elbow ? " " Good ! Take me along  --  pretty please ? " " It would annoy Anita . " " Brian , Anita has considerably more than annoyed me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Mmm . . . would you refrain from doing something that might damage the welfare of all of us ? " " If it were pointed out to me , yes . I might ask for explanation . " " You will have it . But let me deal with your second point . Of course Ellen will get every penny that is coming to her . But you will concede that there is no urgency about paying it to her . Hasty marriages often do not last long . And , while I have no proof of it , it is quite possible that Ellen has been taken in by a fortune  | hunter . Let 's wait a bit and see how anxious this chap is to lay hands on her money . Is n't that prudent ? " I had to admit it . He continued : " Marjorie , my love , you are especially dear to me and to all of us because we see too little of you . It makes each of your trips home a fresh honeymoon for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , you do n't understand why the rest of us are always careful to keep Anita soothed down . " " Well ? No , I do n't . It should work both ways . " " In dealing with the law and with people I have found a vast difference between should ' and is . ' I 've lived with Anita longest of any of us ; I 've learned to live with her little ways . What you may not realize is that she is the glue that holds the family together . " " How , Brian ? " " There is the obvious matter of her custodianship . As manager of the family finances and businesses she is well-nigh irreplaceable . Perhaps some other one of us could do it but it is certain that no one wants the job and I strongly suspect that no one of us could approach her competence . But in ways other than money she is a strong , capable executive . Whether it is in stopping quarrels between children or in deciding any of the thousand issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always make up her mind and keep things moving . A group family , such as ours , must have a strong , capable leader . " ( Strong , capable tyrant , I said under my breath . ) " So . Marjie girl , can you wait a bit and give old Brian time to work it out ? Believe that I love Ellen as much as you do ? " I patted his hand . " Certainly , dear . " ( But do n't take forever ! ) " Now , when we get home , will you find Vickie and tell her that you were joking and that you are sorry you upset her ? Please , dear . " ( Wups ! I had been thinking about Ellen so hard that I had forgotten where this conversation started . ) " Now wait one moment , Brian . I 'll wait and avoid annoying Anita since you tell me it 's necessary . But I 'm not going to cater to Vickie 's racial prejudices . " " You would not be doing so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . I agree with you and you will find that Liz does , too . Vickie is somewhat on the fence ; she wants to find any excuse to get Ellen back into the family and , now that I 've talked to her , is willing to concede that Tongans are just like Maori and that the  | real test is the person himself . But it 's that strange jest you made about yourself that has her upset . " " Oh . Brian , you once told me that you had almost earned a degree in biology when you switched to law . " " Yes . Almost ' may be too strong . " " Then you know that an artificial person is biologically indistinguishable from an ordinary human being . The lack of a soul does not show . " " Eh ? I 'm merely a vestryman , dear ; souls are a matter for theologians . But it is certainly not difficult to spot a living artifact . " " I did n't say living artifact . ' That term covers even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person is strictly limited to human form and appearance . So how can you spot one ? That was the silly thing Vickie was saying , that she could always spot one . Take me , for example . Brian , you know my physical being quite thoroughly  --  I 'm happy to say . Am I an ordinary human being ? Or an artificial person ? " Brian grinned and licked his lips . " Lovely Marjie , I will testify in any court that you are human to nine decimal places . . . except where you are angelic . Shall I specify ? " " Knowing your tastes , dear , I do n't think it 's necessary . ' Thank you . But please be serious . Assume , for the sake of argument , that I am an artificial person . How could a man in bed with me  --  as you were last night and many other nights  --  tell that I was artificial ? " " Marjie , please drop it . It 's not funny . " ( Sometimes human people exasperate me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm an artificial person . " " Marjorie ! " " You wo n't take my word for it ? Must I prove it ? " " Stop joking . Stop this instant ! Or , so help me , when I get you home I 'll paddle you . Marjorie , I 've never laid an ungentle hand on you  --  on any of my wives . But you are earning a spanking . " " So ? See that last bite of tart on your plate ? I am about to take it . Slap your hands together right over your plate and stop me . " " Do n't be silly . " " Do it . You ca n't move fast enough to stop me . " We locked eyes . Suddenly he started to slap his hands together . I went into automatic overdrive , picked up my fork , stabbed that bite of tart , pulled back the fork between his closing hands ,  | stopped the overdrive just before I placed the bite between my lips . ( That plastic spoon in the creche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I used a fork I stabbed my lip because I had not yet learned to slow my moves to match unenhanced persons . ) There may not be a word for the expression on Brian 's face . " Is that enough ? " I asked him . " No , probably not . My dear , clasp hands with me . " I shoved out my right hand . He hesitated , then took it . I let him control the grasp , then I started slowly to tighten down . " Do n't hurt yourself , dear , " I warned him . " Let me know when to stop . " Brian is no sissy and can take quite a bit of pain . I was about to slack off , not wishing to break any bones in his hand , when he suddenly said , " Enough ! " I immediately slacked off and started to massage his hand gently with both of mine . " I did not enjoy hurting you , darling , but I had to show you that I am telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexes or unusual strength . But I do need them in the work I am in . On several occasions enhanced strength and speed have kept me alive . I am most careful not to use either one unless forced to . Now  --  is there anything more needed to prove to you that I am what I say I am ? I am enhanced in other ways but speed and strength are easiest to demonstrate . " He answered , " It 's time we started home . " On the way home we did n't exchange a dozen words . I am very fond of the luxury of horse-and-buggy rides . But that day I would happily have used something noisy and mechanical  --  but fast ! For the next few days Brian avoided me ; I saw him only at the dinner table . Came a morning when Anita said to me , " Marjorie dear , I 'm going into town on a few errands . Will you come along and help me ? " Of course I said yes . She made several stops in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in which she needed my help . I concluded that she simply wanted company and I was pleased by it . Anita is awfully nice to be with as long as one does n't cross her will . Finished , we strolled down Cambridge Terrace along the bank of the Avon and on into Hagley Park and the botanic gardens . She picked a sunny spot where we could watch the birds , and got  | out her knitting . We talked of nothing in particular for a while , or simply sat . We had been there about half an hour when her phone buzzed . She took it out of her knitting bag , put the button to her ear . " Yes ? " Then she added , " Thank you . Off , " and put the phone away without offering to tell me who had called her . Her privilege . Although she did speak of it indirectly : " Tell me , Marjorie , do you ever feel regret ? Or a sense of guilt ? " " Why , I do sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain as I thought that I had been unusually careful not to upset Anita . " Over the way you have deceived us and cheated us . " " What ? " " Do n't play innocent . I 've never had to deal with a creature not of God 's Law before . I was not sure that the concept of sin and guilt was one you could understand . Not that it matters , I suppose , now that you are unmasked . The family is asking for annulment at once ; Brian is seeing Mr. Justice Ridgley today . " I sat up very straight . " On what grounds ? I 've done nothing wrong ! " " Indeed . You forget that , under our laws , a nonhuman can not enter into a marriage contract with human beings . " An hour later I boarded the shuttle for Auckland and then had time to consider my folly .  | For almost three months , ever since the night I had discussed it with Boss , I had for the first time been feeling easy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was " as human as Mother Eve " and that I could safely tell anyone that I was an AP because I would not be believed . Boss was almost right . But he had not counted on my making a really determined effort to prove that I was not " human " under Ennzedd law . My first impulse had been to demand a hearing before the full family council  --  only to learn that my case had already been tried in camera and the vote had gone against me , six to nothing . I did n't even go back to the house . That phone call Anita had received while we were in the botanic gardens had told her that my personal effects had been packed and delivered to Left Luggage at the shuttle station . I could still have insisted on a poll of the house instead of talcing Anita 's ( slippery ) word for it . But to what end ? To win an argument ? To prove a point ? Or merely to split a hair ? It took me all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . As vanished as a rainbow , as burst as a soap bubble  --  I no longer " belonged . " Those children were not mine , I would never again roll on the floor with them . I was thinking about this with dry-eyed grief and almost missed learning that Anita had been " generous " with me : In that contract I had signed with the family corporation the fine print made  | the principal sum due and payable at once if I breached the contract . Did being " nonhuman " constitute a breach ? ( Even though I had never missed a payment . ) Looked at one way , if they were going to read me out of the family , then I had at least eighteen thousand Ennzedd dollars coming to me : looked at another way I not only forfeited the paid-up part of my share but owed more than twice that amount . But they were " generous " : If I would quietly and quickly vanish away , they would not pursue their claim against me . Unstated was what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I slunk away . I do n't need a psychiatrist to tell me that I did it to myself ; I realized that fact as soon as Anita announced the bad news . A deeper question is : Why did I do it ? I had not done it for Ellen and I could not hoodwink myself into thinking that I had . On the contrary , my folly had made it impossible for me to exert any effort on her behalf . Why had I done it ? Anger . I was n't able to find any better answer . Anger at the whole human race for deciding that my sort are not human and therefore not entitled to equal treatment and equal justice . Resentment that had been building up since the first day that I had been made to realize that there were privileges human children had just from being born and that I could never have simply because I was not human . Passing as human gets one over on the side of privilege ; it does not end resentment against the system . The pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as I truly am , an artificial person , than it was to preserve my happy relationship . I found out . Not one of them stood up for me . . . just as none of them had stood up for Ellen . I think I knew that they would reject me as soon as I learned that they had failed Ellen . But that level of my mind is so far down that I 'm not well acquainted with it  --  that 's the dark place where , according to Boss , I do all my real thinking . I reached Auckland too late for the daily SB to Winnipeg . After  | reserving a cradle for the next day 's trajectory and checking everything but my jumpbag , I considered what to do with the twentyone hours facing me , and at once thought of my curly wolf , Captain Ian . By what he had told me , the chances were five-to-one against his being in town  --  but his flat ( if available ) might be pleasanter than a hotel . So I found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted ; a young woman 's face  --  cheerful , rather pretty  --  appeared . " Hi ! I 'm Torchy . Who 're you ? " " I 'm Marj Baldwin , " I answered . " Perhaps I 've punched wrong . I 'm seeking Captain Tormey . " " No , you 're with it , luv . Hold and I 'll let him out of his cage . " t She turned and moved away from the pickup while calling out , " Bubber ! A slashing tart on the honker . Knows your right name . " As she turned and moved away I noticed bare breasts . She came fully into view and I saw that she was jaybird to her heels . A good body  --  possibly a bit wide in the fundament but with long legs , a slender waist , and mammaries that matched mine . . . and I 've had no complaints . I quietly cursed to myself . I knew quite well why I had called the captain : to forget three men in the arms of a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fully committed . He appeared , dressed but not much  --  a lava-lava . He looked puzzled , then recognized me . " Hey ! Miss . . . Baldwin ! That 's it . This is sonky-do ! Where are you ? " " At the port . I punched on the off chance of saying hello . " " Stay where you are . Do n't move , do n't breathe . Seven seconds while I pull on trousers and shirt , and I 'll come get you . " " No , Captain . Just a greeting . Again I am simply making connections . " " What is your connection ? To what port ? What time is de-parture ? " Damn and triple damn  --  I had not prepared my lies . Well , the truth is often better than a clumsy lie . " I 'm going back to Winnipeg . " " Ah so ! Then you are looking at your pilot ; I have the noon lift tomorrow . Tell me exactly where you are and I 'll pick you up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab fast enough . " " Captain , you are very sweet and you are out of your mind . You already have all the company you can handle . The young IIII'j woman who answered my call . Torchy. "  | " Torchy is n't her name ; that 's her condition . She 's my sister Betty , from Sydney . Stays here when she 's in town . I probably mentioned her . " He turned his head and shouted . " Betty ! Come here and identify yourself . But get decent . " " It 's too late to get decent , " her cheerful voice answered , and I saw her , past his shoulder , returning toward the pickup and wrapping a lava-lava around her hips as she did so . She seemed to be having a little trouble with it and I suspected that she had had a few . " Oh , the hell with it ! My brother is always trying to get me to behave  --  my husband has given up . Look , Inv , I heard what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless you are trying to marry him , in which case I am his fiancee . Are you ? " " No . " " Good . Then you can have him . I 'm about to make tea . Do you take gin ? Or whisky ? " " Whatever you and the Captain are having . " " He must not have either ; he 's lifting in less than twenty-four hours . But you and I will get smashed . " " I 'll drink what you do . Anything but hemlock . " I then convinced Ian that it was better for me to find a hansom at the port where they were readily available than it was for him to send for one , then make the round trip . Number 17 , Locksley Parade , is a new block of flats of the double-security type ; I was locked through the entrance to Ian 's flat as if it were a spaceship . Betty greeted me with a hug and a kiss that showed that she had indeed been drinking ; my curly wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that he had not been drinking but that he expected to take me to bed in the near future . He did not ask about my husbands ; I did not volunteer anything about my family  --  my former family . Ian and I got along well because we both understood the signals , used them correctly , and never misled the other . While Ian and I held this wordless discussion , Betty left the room and returned with a red lava-lava . " It 's formal high tea , " she announced , with a slight belch , " so out of those street clothes and into this , luv . " Her idea ? Or his ? Hers , I decided , before long . While Ian 's simple , wholesome lechery was as clear as a punch in the jaw , he was basically rather cubical . Not so Betty , who was utterly outlaw . I did n't care , as it moved in the direction I wanted to go . Bare feet are as provocative as bare breasts , although most people do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lava-lava is far more provocative than one totally nude . The party was shaping up to suit me , and I would depend on Ian to shake off his sister 's chaperonage when the time came . If necessary . It seemed possible that Betty would sell tickets . I did n't fret about it . I got smashed . Just how thorough a job I did on it I did not realize until next morning when I woke up in bed with a man who was not Ian Tormey . For several minutes I lay still and watched him snore while I poked through my gin-beclouded memories , trying to fit him in . It seemed to me that a woman really ought to be introduced to a man before spending a night with him . Had we been formally introduced ? Had we met at all ? In bits and pieces it came back . Name : Professor Federico Farnese , called either " Freddie " or " Chubbie . " ( Not very chubby ? just a little pot from a swivel-chair profession . ) Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat from the evening before but could not now ( next morning ) recall just when he had arrived , or why he had been away . . . if I ever knew . Once I placed him I was not especially surprised to find that I ( seemed to have ) spent the night with him . The frame of mind I had been in the night before no male would have been safe from me . But one thing bothered me : Had I turned my back on my host in order to chase after some other man ? Not polite , Friday ? not gracious . I dug deeper . No , at least once I decidedly had not turned my back on Ian . To my great pleasure . And to Ian 's , too , if his comments were sincere . Then I had indeed turned my back but at his request . No , I had not been ungracious to my host , and he had been very kind to me , in exactly the fashion I needed to help me forget how I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-righteous racists . Thereafter my host had had some help from this late arrival , I now remembered . It is never surprising that an emotionally troubled woman may need more soothing than one man can supply ? but I could not remember how the transaction was achieved . Fair exchange ? Do n't snoop , Friday ! An AP can not empathize with or understand the various human copulation taboos  --  but I had most carefully memorized all the many , many sorts while taking basic  | doxy training , and I knew that this one was one of the strongest , one that humans cover up even where all else is wide open . So I resolved to shun even a hint of interest . Freddie stopped snoring and opened his eyes . He yawned and stretched , then saw me and looked puzzled , then suddenly grinned and reached for me . I answered his grin and his grab , ready to cooperate heartily , when Ian walked in . He said , " Morning , Marj . Freddie , I hate to interrupt but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get dressed . We 're leaving at once . " Freddie did not let go of me . He simply clucked , then recited : " A birdie with a yellow bill hopped upon my windowsill . He cocked a shiny eye and said , Ai n't you ashamed , you sleepyhead ? ' " Captain , your attention to duty and to the welfare of our guest does you credit . What time must you be there ? Minus two hours ? And you lift at high noon as the clock is striking the steeple . No ? " " Yes , but ? " " Whereas Helen  --  your name is Helen ? ? is kosher if she presents herself at the gate called strait no later than minus thirty minutes . This I will undertake . " " Fred , I do n't like to be a spoilsport but it can take a bloody hour to get a cab here , as you know . I have one waiting . " " How true . Cabbies avoid us ; their horses do n't like our hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired a rig , pledging a purse of gold . At this very moment old faithful Rosinante is under this house in one of the janitor 's stalls , gaining strength on nubbins of maize for her coming ordeal . When I phone down , said janitor , well plied with bribes , will harness the dear beast and fetch wain and her to entrance . Whereupon I will deliver Helen to the gate no later than minus thirty-one . To this end I pledge the pound of flesh nearest your heart . " " Your heart , you mean . " " I phrased it most carefully . " " Well  --  Marj ? " " Uh  --  Is it all right , Ian ? I do n't really want to jump out of bed this second . But I do n't want to miss your ship . " " You wo n't . Freddie is reliable ; he just does n't look it . But  | leave here by eleven ; then you could make it on foot if you had to . I can hold your reservation after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well ; resume whatever it was you were doing . " Ian glanced at his watch finger . " Nine up . Bye . " " Hey ! Kiss me good-bye ! " " Why ? I 'll see you at the ship . And we have a date in Winnipeg . " " Kiss me , damn it , or I 'll miss the bloody ship ! " " So untangle yourself from that fat Roman and mind you do n't get spots on my clean uniform . " " Do n't chance it , old son . I will kiss Helen on your behalf . " Ian leaned down and kissed me thoroughly and I did not muss his pretty uniform . Then he kissed the top of Freddie 's head on his little bald spot and said , " Have fun , chums . But get her to the gate on time . Bye . " Betty glanced in at that point ; her brother gathered her in with one arm and took her away . I turned my attention back to Freddie . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while thinking happily that Ian and Betty and Freddie were just what Friday needed to offset the puritanical hypocrites I had lived with far too long . Betty fetched in morning tea precisely on the moment , so I assume that she listened . She made a lotus on the bed and had a cuppa with us . Then we got up and had breakfast . I had porridge with thick cream , two beautiful eggs , Canterbury ham , a fat chop , fried potatoes , hot muffins with strawberry jam and the world 's best butter , and an orange , all washed down with strong black tea with sugar and milk . If all the world broke fast the way New Zealand does , we would n't have political unrest . Freddie put on a lava-lava to eat breakfast but Betty did n't so I did n't . Being creche-raised , I can never learn enough about human manners and etiquette but I do know that a woman guest must dress  --  or undress  --  to match her hostess . I 'm not really used to skin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but Betty was awfully easy to be with . I wondered if she would snub me if she knew that I was not human . I did n't think so but I was not anxious to test it . A happy breakfast . Freddie delivered me to the passenger lounge at eleven-twenty , sent for Ian , and demanded a receipt . Solemnly Ian wrote one . Again Ian belted me into the acceleration cradle , while saying quietly , " You did n't really need help with this the other time , did you ? "  | " No , " I agreed , " but I 'm glad I pretended . I 've had a wonderful time ! " " And we 'll have a good time in Winnipeg , too . I reached Janet during countdown , let her know that you would be with us for dinner . She told me to tell you that you would be with us for breakfast as well  --  she says to tell you that it is silly to leave Winnipeg in the middle of the night ; you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the informal immigrants we get over the border from the Imperium would kill you for a toke . " " I 'll speak with her about it when we get there . " ( Captain Ian , you triflin ' man , you told me that you would never marry because you must " go where the wild goose goes . " I wonder if you recall that ? I do n't think you do . ) " It 's settled . Janet might not trust my judgment about women ? she says I 'm prejudiced , a base canard . But she does trust Betty ? and by now Betty has phoned her . She 's known Betty longer than she 's known me ; they were roommates at McGill . And that 's where I got Janet and Fred got Sis ; we four were subversives ? every now and then we would unhook the North Pole and turn it around . " " Betty is a darling . Is Janet like her ? " " Yes and no . Janet was the leader of our seditious activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a captain . Actually the computer flies this tin coffin but I 'm planning to learn how next week . " He left . After the healing catharsis of a night of drunken saturnalia with Ian and Freddie and Betty I was able to think about my exfamily more rationally . Had I in fact been cheated ? I had signed that silly contract willingly , including the termination clause I tripped on . Had I been paying for sex ? No , what I had told Ian was true ; sex is everywhere . I had paid for the happy privilege of belonging . To a family  --  especially the homely delights of changing wet nappies and washing dishes and petting kittens . Mister Underfoot was far more important to me than Anita had ever been  --  although I had never let myself think about it . I had tried to love them all until the matter of Ellen had thrown light into some dirty corners . Let me see now : I knew exactly how many days I had been able to spend with my ex-family . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscated ) my cost for room and board for those  | sweet vacations was slightly over four hundred and fifty Ennzedd dollars per day . A high price even for a luxury resort . But the actual cost to the family of having me at home was less than a fortieth of that . On what financial terms had each of the others joined the family ? I had never known . Had Anita , unable to stop the men from inviting me in , rigged things so that I could not afford to quit my job and live at home but nevertheless tied me to the family on terms quite profitable to the family  --  i.e. , to Anita ? No way to tell . I knew so little about marriage among human beings that I had not been able to judge ? and still could not . But I had learned one thing : Brian had surprised me by turning against me . I had thought of him as the older , wiser , sophisticated member of the family , the one who could accept the fact of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done so had I picked some other enhanced quality to demonstrate , some nonthreatening ability . But I had bested him in a feat of strength , a matter in which a male quite reasonably expects to win . I had hit him in his male pride . Unless you intend to kill him immediately thereafter , never kick a man in the balls . Not even symbolically . Or perhaps especially not symbolically .  | Presently free fall went away and we entered the incredibly thrilling sensations of hypersonic glide . The computer was doing a good job of smoothing out the violence , but you could still feel the vibration in your teeth  --  and I could feel it elsewhere after my busy night . We dropped through transonic rather abruptly , then spent a long time in subsonic , with the scream building up . Then we touched and the retros cut in . . . and shortly we stopped . And I took a deep breath . Much as I like the SBs , I ca n't relax from touchdown to full stop . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived forty minutes later at Winnipeg the day before ( Wednesday ) in the early evening , 1940 hours . ( Do n't blame me ; go look at a map  --  one with time zones marked . ) Again I waited and was last passenger out . Our captain again picked up my bag but this time escorted me with the casualness of an old friend  --  and I felt enormously warmed by it . He took me through a side door , then went with me through Customs , Health , and Immigration , offering his own jumpbag first . The CHI officer did not touch it . " Hi , Captain . What are you smuggling this time ? " " The usual . Illicit diamonds . Trade secrets . Weapons specs . Contraband drugs . " " That 's all ? It 's a waste of chalk . " He scrawled something on Ian 's bag . " Is she with you ? " " Never saw her before in my life . "  | " Me Injun squaw , " I asserted . " White boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise . " " I could have told you . Going to be here long ? " " I live in the Imperium . Transient , possibly overnight . I came through here on my way to New Zealand last month . Here 's my passport . " He glanced at it , stamped it , scrawled on my bag without opening it . " If you decide to stay a little longer , I 'll buy you firewater . But do n't trust Captain Tormey . " We went on through . Just beyond the barrier Ian dropped both our bags , picked up a woman by her elbows  --  proving his excellent condition ; she was only ten centimeters junior to him  --  and kissed her enthusiastically . He put her down . " Jan , this is Marj . " ( When Ian had this sultry job at home , why did he bother with my meager assets ? Because I was there and she was n't , no doubt . But now she is . Dear lady , got a good book I can read ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held me with both hands at arm 's length . " I do n't see it . Did you leave it in the ship ? " " Leave what ? This jumpbag is all I carried  --  my luggage is in transit bond . " " No , dear , your halo . Betty led me to expect a halo . " I considered this . " Are you sure she said halo ? " " Well . . . she said you were an angel . Perhaps I jumped to a conclusion . " " Perhaps . I do n't think I was wearing a halo last night ; I hardly ever wear one when traveling . " Captain Ian said , " That 's right . Last night all she had on was a load , a big one . Sweetheart , I hate to tell you this but Betty was a bad influence . Deplorable . " " Oh , heavens ! Perhaps we had best go straight to prayer meeting . Shall we , Marjorie ? Tea and a biscuit here , and skip dinner ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , Janet . " ( Did I have to agree to this ? I did n't know the etiquette for a " prayer meeting . " ) Captain Tormey said , " Janet , perhaps we had better take her home and pray for her there . I 'm not sure Marj is used to public confessions of sins . " " Marjorie , would you rather do that ? " " I think I would . Yes . " " Then we will . Ian , will you hail Georges ? "  | Georges turned out to be Georges Perreault . That is all I learned about him just then , save that he was driving a pair of Morgan blacks hitched to a Honda surrey suitable for the very wealthy . How much is an SB captain paid ? Friday , it 's none of your business . But it was certainly a handsome rig . So was Georges , for that matter . Handsome , I mean . He was tall , dark-haired , dressed in dark suit and kepi , and looked a very proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant and he bent over my hand and kissed it . Does a coachman kiss hands ? I keep running into human practices not covered by my training . Ian sat in front by Georges ; Janet took me behind with her and opened a large down rug . " I thought you might not have a wrap with you , coming from Auckland , " she explained . " So snuggle under . " I did not protest that I never get cold ; it was very thoughtful and I snuggled under with her . Georges wheeled us out onto the highway , clucked to the horses , and they broke into a brisk trot . Ian took a horn from a rack on the dashboard and sounded a blast on it  --  there did n't seem to be any reason for it ; I think he just liked to make a loud noise . We did not go into the city of Winnipeg . Their home was southwest of a small town , Stonewall , north of the city and closer to the port . By the time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : It was a country estate designed to hold off anything short of professional military attack . There were three gates in series , with gates one and two forming a holding pen . I did n't spot Eyes or remoted weapons but I was sure they were there  --  the estate was marked out by the red-and-white beacons that warn float craft not to try it . I got only the barest glimpse of whatever matched the three gates  --  too dark . A wall and two fences I saw , but I could not see how they were armed and/or booby-trapped and hesitated to ask . But no sensible person spends that much on household protection and then relies totally on passive defense . I wanted to ask about their power arrangements , too , recalling how at the farm Boss had lost the main Shipstone ( cut by " Uncle Jim " ) and thereby lost his defenses  --  but again it was not something a guest could ask . I wondered even more what would have happened if we had been jumped before they got inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisk trade in illegal weapons that wind up in the hands of the putatively disarmed , it was the sort of question one did not ask . I walk around unarmed , usually , but I do n't assume  | that others do so  --  most people have neither my enhancements nor my special training . ( I would rather rely on my " unarmed " state than depend on hardware that can be taken from you at any checkpoint , or that you can lose , or that can run out of ammo , or jam , or be powerdown when it matters . I do n't look armed , and that gives me an edge . But other people , other problems  --  I 'm a special case . ) We rode up a sweeping drive and under an overhang and stopped  --  and again Ian sounded a foul blast on that silly horn ? but this time there seemed to be some point to it ; the front doors opened . Ian said , " Take her inside , dear ; I 'm going to help Georges with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Pipe down . " Ian got out and handed us down , gave my jumpbag to his wife  --  and Georges pulled away . Ian simply followed on foot . Janet led me inside  --  and I gasped . I was looking through the foyer at an illuminated fountain , a programmed one ; it changed in shapes and colors as I stood there . There was gentle background music , which ( possibly ) controlled the fountain . " Janet . . . who 's your architect ? " " Like it ? " " Of course ! " " Then I 'll admit it . I 'm the architect , Ian is the gadgeteer , Georges controlled the interiors . He is several sorts of an artist and another wing is his studio . And I might as well tell you right now that Betty told me to hide your clothes until Georges paints at least one nude of you . " " Betty said that ? But I 've never been a model and I must get back to my job . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you shy about it ? Betty did not think you would be . Georges might settle for the draped figure . At first . " " No , I 'm not shy . Uh , maybe a bit shy about posing ; the idea is new to me . Look , can we let it wait ? Right now I 'm more interested in plumbing than in posing ; I have n't been near any since I left Betty 's flat  --  I should have stopped at the port . " " Sorry , dear ; I should not have kept you standing here talking about Georges ' painting . My mother taught me years ago that the very first thing to do for a guest is to show her where the bathroom is. "  | " My mother taught me the exact same thing , " I fibbed . " This way . " A hallway opened to the left from the fountain ; she led me down it and into a room . " Your room , " she announced , dropping my bag on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share it with me , as my room is the mirror image of this room , on the other side . " There was plenty to share  --  three stalls , each with WC , bidet , and hand tray ; a shower big enough for a caucus , with controls I was going to have to ask about ; a massage and suntan table ; a plunge  --  or was it a hot tub ? ? that clearly was planned for loafing in company ; twin dressing tables with basins ; a terminal ; a refrigerator ; a bookcase with one shelf for cassettes . " No leopard ? " I said . " You expected one ? " " Every time I 've seen this room in the sensies the heroine had a pet leopard with her . " " Oh . Will you settle for a kitten ? " " Certainly . Are you and Ian cat people ? " " I would n't attempt to keep house without one . In fact just now I can offer you a real bargain in kittens . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Discuss it later . Help yourself to the plumbing . Want a shower before dinner ? I intend to grab one ; I spent too much time currying Black Beauty and Demon before going to the port , and ran out of time . Did you notice that I whiffed of stable ? " And that is how , by easy stages , I found myself ten or twelve minutes later having my back washed by Georges while Ian washed my front while my hostess washed herself and laughed and offered advice that was ignored . If I were to elaborate , you would see that each step was perfectly logical and that these gentle sybarites did nothing to rush me . Nor was there even the mildest attempt to seduce me , not even a hint that I had already raped ( symbolic rape , at least ) my host the night before . Then I shared with them a sybaritic feast in their living room ( drawing room , great hall , whatever ) in front of a fire that was actually one of Ian 's gadgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Janet 's notion of a dinner-gown negligee would have got her arrested in Christchurch . But it did not cause a pass from either man . When we reached coffee and brandy , me somewhat blurry from drinks before dinner and wine during dinner , by request I removed that borrowed neg- ligee and Georges posed me five or six ways , took stereos and holos of me in each , while discussing me as if I were a side of beef . I continued to insist that I had to leave tomorrow morning but my protests became feeble and pro forma  --  Georges paid no attention to them whatever . He said I had " good masses " ? maybe this is a compliment ; it certainly is not a pass . But he got some awfully good pictures of me , especially one of me lying sort of Hang clang on a low couch with five kittens crawling over my breasts and legs and belly . I asked for that one and it turned out that Georges had the equipment to copy it . Then Georges took some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for a copy of one of them because we made a beautiful contrast and Georges had a knack for making us look better than we g did . But presently I started to yawn and Janet told Georges to stop . I apologized , saying that there was no excuse for me to be sleepy since it was still early evening by the zone where I had started the day . Janet said pishantosh , that being sleepy had nothing to do with clocks and time zones  --  gentlemen , we are going to bed . She led me away . We stopped in that beautiful bath and she put her arms around me . " Marjie , do you want company , or do you want to sleep alone ? I know from Betty that you had a busy night last night ; possibly you prefer a quiet night alone . Or possibly not . Name it . " I told her honestly that I did not sleep alone by choice . " Me , too , " she agreed , " and it 's nice to hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending the way some slitches do . Whom do you want in your bed ? " You sweet darling , surely you are entitled to your own husband the night he gets home . " Maybe that should be turned around . Who wants to sleep with me ? " " Why , all of us , I feel certain . Or any two . Or any one . You name it . " I blinked and wondered how much I had had to drink . " Four in one bed ? " " Do you like that ? " " I 've never tried it . It sounds jolly but the bed would be awfully crowded , I think . " " Oh . You have n't been in my room . A big bed . Because both Liy husbands often choose to sleep with me . . . and there is still plenty of room to invite a guest to join us. "  | Yes , I had been drinking  --  two nights in a row and far more than I was used to . " Two husbands ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian Plan . " " British Canada has not ; British Canadians have . Or many thousands of us . The gates are locked and it 's nobody 's business . Do you want to try the big bed ? If you get sleepy , you can crawl off to your own room  --  a major reason I planned this suite the way I did . Well , dear ? " " Uh . . . yes . But I may be self-conscious about it . " " You 'll get over it . Let 's ? " She was interrupted by a jangly bell at the terminal . Janet said , " Oh , damn , damn ! That almost certainly means that they want Ian at the port  --  even though he 's just back from a high lift . " She stepped to the terminal , switched it on . " ? cause for alarm . Our border with the Chicago Imperium has been sealed off and refugees are being rounded up . The attack by Quebec is more serious but may be an error by a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of emergency is now in effect , so stay off the streets , keep calm , and listen on this wavelength for official news and instructions . " Red Thursday had started .  | I suppose everybody has more or less the same picture in mind of Red Thursday and what followed . But to explain me ( to me , if that be possible ! ) I must tell how I saw it , including the bumbling confusion and doubts . We four did wind up in Janet 's big bed but for company and mutual comfort , not sex . We all had our ears bent for news , our eyes on the terminal 's screen . More or less the same news was repeated again and again  --  aborted attack from Quebec , Chairman of the Chicago Imperium killed in his bed , the border with the Imperium closed , unverified sabotage reports , stay off the streets , remain calm  --  but no matter how often it was repeated we always all shut up and listened , waiting for some item that would cause the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all night long . By four in the morning we knew that killings and sabotage were all over the globe ; by daylight unverified reports were coming in of trouble at Ell-Four , at Tycho Base , at Stationary Station , and ( broken-off message ) on Ceres . There was no way to guess whether or not the trouble extended as far as Alpha Centauri or Tau Ceti ... but an official voice on the terminal did guess by loudly refusing to guess and by telling the rest of us not to engage in harmful speculation . About four , Janet , with some help from me , made sandwiches and served coffee . I woke up at nine because Georges moved . I found that I was sleeping with my head on his chest and my upper arm clinging to ' rim . Ian was across the bed , lying-sitting propped up against pil- lows with his eyes still on the screen  --  but his eyes were closed . Janet was missing  --  she had gone to my room , crawled into what was nominally my bed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untangle myself and get out of bed without waking Georges . I did so , and slid into the bathroom , where I got rid of used coffee and felt better . I glanced into " my " room , saw my missing hostess . She was awake , waggled her fingers at me , then motioned for me to come in . She moved over and I crawled in with her . She kissed me . " How are the boys ? " " Both still asleep . Or were three minutes ago . " " Good . They need sleep . Both of them are worriers ; I am not . I decided that there was no point in attending Armageddon with my eyes bloodshot , so I came in here . You were asleep , I think . " " Could have been . I do n't know when I fell asleep . It seemed to me that I heard the same bad news a thousand times . Then I woke up . " " You have n't missed anything . I 've kept the sound turned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been spelling out the same old sad story . Marjorie , the boys are waiting for the bombs to drop . I do n't think there will be any bombs . " " I hope you 're right . But why not ? " " Who drops H-bombs on whom ? Who is the enemy ? All the major power blocs are in trouble , as near as I can tell from the news . But , aside from what seems to have been a stupid mistake by some Quebecois general , no military forces have been involved anywhere . Assassinations , fires , explosions , all sorts of sabotage , riots , terrorism of all kinds  --  but no pattern . It 's not East against West , or Marxists against fascists , or blacks against whites . Marjorie , if anyone sets off missiles , it will mean that the whole world has gone crazy . " " Does n't it look that way now ? " " I do n't think so . The pattern of this is that it has no pattern . The target is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally . " " Anarchists ? " I suggested . " Nihilists , maybe . " Ian came in wearing circles under his eyes , a day 's beard , a worried look , and an old bathrobe too short for him . His knees were knobby . " Janet , I ca n't reach Betty or Freddie . " " Were they going back to Sydney ? "  | " It 's not that . I ca n't get through to either Sydney or Auckland . All I get is that damned synthetic computer voice : A-circuit ! **31;372;TOOLONG . **43;405;TOOLONG . ' You know . " " Ouch . More sabotage , maybe ? " " Could be . But maybe worse . After that kark , I called traffic control at the port and asked whatinhell was wrong with Winnipeg  --  Auckland satellite bounce ? By pulling rank I eventually got the supervisor . He told me to forget about calls that did n't get through because they had real trouble . All SBs grounded  --  because two were sabotaged in space . Winnipeg  --  Buenos Aires Lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Total loss , both . No survivors . Pressure fuses , no doubt , as each one blew on leaving atmosphere . Jan , the next time I lift , I 'm going to inspect everything myself . Stop the countdown on the most trivial excuse . " He added , " But I ca n't guess when that will be . You ca n't lift an SB when your comm circuits to reentry port are broken . . . and the supervisor admitted that they had lost all bounce circuits . " Janet got out of bed , stood up , kissed him . " Now stop worrying ! Stop . At once . Of course you will check everything yourself until they catch the saboteurs . But right now you 'll put it out of your mind because you wo n't be called to lift until the comm circuits are restored . So declare a holiday . As for Betty and Freddie , it 's a shame we ca n't talk to them but they can take care of themselves and you know it . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . I 'm just glad it happened while you are at home ? instead of halfway around the globe . You 're here and you 're safe and that 's all I care about . We 'll just sit here , snug and happy , until this nonsense is over . " " I 've got to go to Vancouver . " " Man o ' mine , you do n't got ' to do anything , save pay taxes and die . They wo n't be putting artifacts into the ships when no ships are lifting . " " Artifacts , " I blurted and regretted it . Ian seemed to see me for the first time . " Hi , Mari  --  morning . Nothing you need fret about  --  and I 'm sorry about this hoop-tedo while you 're our guest . The artifacts Jan mentioned are n't gadgets ; they 're alive . Management has this wild notion that a living artifact designed for piloting can do a better job than a man can  | do . I 'm shop steward for the Winnipeg Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in Vancouver tomorrow . " " Ian , " Jan said , " phone the General Secretary . It 's silly to go to Vancouver without checking first . " " Okay , okay . " " But do n't just ask . Urge the SecGen to pressure management to postpone the meeting until the emergency is over . I want you to stay right here and keep me safe from harm . " " Or vice versa . " " Or vice versa , " she agreed . " But I 'll faint in your arms if necessary . What would you like for breakfast ? Do n't make it too complex or I 'll invoke your standing commitment . " I was n't really listening as the word artifact had triggered me . I had been thinking of Ian  --  of all of them , really , here and Down Under  --  as being so civilized and sophisticated that they would regard my sort as just as good as humans . And now I hear that Ian is committed to representing his guild in a labor-management fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you have us do , Ian ? Cut our throats ? We did n't ask to be produced any more than you asked to be born . We may not be human but we share the age-old fate of humans ; we are strangers in a world we never made . ) " Well , Marj ? " " Uh , sorry , I was woolgathering . What did you say , Jan ? " " I asked what you wanted for breakfast , dear . " " Uh , does n't matter ; I eat anything that is standing still or even moving slowly . May I come with you and help ? Please ? " " I was hoping you would offer . Because Ian is n't much use in a kitchen despite his commitment . " " I 'm a damned good cook ! " " Yes , dear . Ian gave me a commitment in writing that he would always cook any meal if I so requested . And he does ; he has n't tried to slide out of it . But I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marj , do n't listen to her . " I still do n't know whether or not Ian can cook , but Janet certainly can ( and so can Georges , as I learned later ) . Janet served us ? with help around the edges from me  --  with light and fluffy mild Cheddar omelettes surrounded by thin , tender pancakes rolled up Continental style with powdered sugar and jam , and garnished  | with well-drained bacon . Plus orange juice from freshly squeezed oranges  --  hand-squeezed , not ground to a pulp by machinery . Plus drip coffee made from freshly ground beans . ( New Zealand food is beautiful but New Zealand cooking practically is n't cooking at all . ) Georges showed up with the exact timing of a cat  --  Mama Cat in this case , who arrived following Georges ahead of him . Kittens were then excluded by Janet 's edict because she was too busy to keep from stepping on kittens . Janet also decreed that the news would be turned off while we ate and that the emergency would not be a subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these strange and grim events had pounded on my mind since they started , even during sleep . As Janet pointed out in handing down this ruling , only an H-bomb was likely to penetrate our defenses , and an H-bomb blast we probably would n't notice  --  so relax and enjoy breakfast . I enjoyed it . . . and so did Mama Cat , who patrolled our feet counterclockwise and informed each of us when it was that person 's turn to supply a bit of bacon  --  I think she got most of it . After I cleared the breakfast dishes ( salvaged rather than recycled ; Janet was old-fashioned in spots ) and Janet made another pot of coffee , she turned the news on again and we settled back to watch it and discuss it  --  in the kitchen rather than the grand room we had used for dinner , the kitchen being their de facto living room . Janet had what is called a " peasant kitchen " although no peasant ever had it so good : a big fireplace , a round table for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable lounging chairs , plenty of floor space and no traffic problems because the cooking took place at the end opposite the comforts . The kittens were allowed back in , ending their protests , and in they came all tails at attention . I picked up one , a fluffy white with big black spots ; its buzz was bigger than it was . It was clear that Mama Cat 's love life had not been limited by a stud book ; no two kittens were alike . Most of the news was a rehash but there was a new development in the Imperium : Democrats were being rounded up , sentenced by drumhead courts-martial ( provost 's tribunals , they were called ) and executed on the spot  --  laser , gunfire , some hangings . I exerted tight mind control to let me watch . They were sentencing them down to the  | age of fourteen  --  we saw one family in which both parents , themselves condemned , were insisting that their son was only twelve . The President of the court , an Imperial Police corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting the boy , and then ordering his squad to finish off the parents and the boy 's older sister . Ian flicked off the picture , shifted to voiceover streamers , and turned the sound down . " I 've seen all of that I want to see , " he growled . " I think that whoever has power there now that the old Chairman is dead is liquidating everybody on their suspects list . " He chewed his lip and looked grim . " Marj , are you still sticking to that silly notion of going home at once ? " " I 'm not a democrat , Ian . I 'm nonpolitical . " " Do you think that kid was political ? Those Cossacks would kill you just for drill . Anyhow , you ca n't . The border is closed . " I did n't tell him that I felt certain that I could wetback any border on earth . " I thought it was sealed only against people trying to come north . Are n't they letting subjects of the Imperium go home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any brighter than that kitten in your lap ? Ca n't you realize that pretty little girls can get hurt if they insist on playing with bad boys ? If you were home , I 'm sure your father would tell you to stay home . But you are here in our home and that gives Georges and me an implied obligation to keep you safe . Eh , Georges ? " " Mais oui , mon vieux ! Certainement ! " " And I will protect you from Georges . Jan , can you convince this child that she is welcome here as long as she cares to stay ? I think she 's the sort of assertive female who tries to pick up the check . " " I am not ! " Janet said , " Marjie , Betty told me to take good care of you . If you think you are imposing , you can contribute to BritCan Red Cross . Or to a home for indignant cats . But it so happens that all three of us make ridiculous amounts of money and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another kitten . Now .. . are you going to stay ? Or am I going to have to hide your clothes and beat you ? " " I do n't want to be beaten . " " Too bad , I was looking forward to it . That 's settled , gentle sirs ; she stays . Marj , we swindled you . Georges will require you to  | pose inordinate hours  --  he 's a brute  --  and he 'll be getting you just for groceries instead of the guild rates he ordinarily has to pay . He 'll show a profit . " " No , " said Georges , " I wo n't show a profit ; I 'll take a profit . Because I 'll show her as a business expense , Jan my heart . But not at guild basic rate ; she 's worth more . One and a half ? " " At least . Double , I would say . Be generous , since you are n't going to pay her anyhow . Do n't you wish you had her on campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " A worthy thought ! One that has been hovering in the back of my mind . . . and thank you , our dear one , for bringing it out into the open . " Georges addressed me : " Marjorie , will you sell me an egg ? " He startled me . I tried to look as if I did not understand him . " I do n't have any eggs . " " Ah , but you do ! Some dozens , in fact , far more than you will ever need for your own purposes . A human ovum is the egg I mean . The laboratory pays far more for an egg than it does for sperm  --  simple arithmetic . Are you shocked ? " " No . Surprised . I thought you were an artist . " Janet put in , " Marj bon , I told you that Georges is several sorts of an artist . He is . In one sort he is Mendel Professor of Teratology at the University of Manitoba . . . and also chief technologist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that calls for high art . But he 's good with paint and canvas , too . Or a computer screen . " " That 's true , " Ian agreed . " Georges is an artist with anything he touches . But you two should not have sprung this on Marj while she 's our guest . Some people get terribly upset at the very idea of gene manipulation  --  especially their own genes . " " Marj , did I upset you ? I 'm sorry . " " No , Jan . I 'm not one of those people who get upset at the very thought of living artifacts or artificial people or whatever . Uh , some of my best friends are artificial people . " " Dear , dear , " Georges said gently , " do not pull the long bow . " " Why do you say that ? " I tried not to make my voice sharp . " I can claim that , because I work in that field and , I am proud to say , have quite a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I interrupted : " I thought an AP never knew her designers ? " " That is true and I have never violated that canon . But I do  | have many opportunities to know both living artifacts and artificial persons  --  they are not the same  --  and to win their friendship . But  --  forgive me , dear Miss Marjorie  --  unless you are a member of my profession ? Are you ? " " No . " " Only a genetic engineer or someone closely associated with the industry can possibly claim a number of friends among artificial people . Because , my dear , contrary to popular myth , it is simply not possible for a layman to distinguish between an artificial person and a natural person . . . and , because of the vicious prejudice of ignorant people , an artificial person almost never voluntarily admits to his derivation  --  I 'm tempted to say never . So , while I am delighted that you do n't go through the roof at the idea of artificial creatures , I am forced to treat your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prejudice . " " Well ? All right . Take it as such . I ca n't see why APs have to be second-class citizens . I think it 's unfair . " " It is . But some people feel threatened . Ask Ian . He 's about to go charging off to Vancouver to keep artificial persons from ever becoming pilots . He ? " " H00000ld it ! I am like hell . I am submitting it that way because my guild brothers voted it that way . But I 'm no fool , Georges ; living with and talking with you has made me aware that we are going to have to compromise . We are no longer really pilots and we have n't been this century . The computer does it . If the computer cuts out I will make a real Boy Scout try at getting that bus safely down out of the sky . But do n't bet on it ! The speeds and the possible emergencies went beyond human-reaction time years back . Oh , I 'll try ! And any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can design an artificial person who can think and move fast enough to cope with a glitch at touchdown , I 'll take my pension . That 's all we 're going to hold out for , anyhow ? if the company puts in AP pilots that displace us , then it has to be full pay and allowances . If you can design them . " " Oh , I could design one , eventually . When I achieved one , if I were allowed to clone , you pilots could all go fishing . But it would n't be an AP ; it would have to be a living artifact . If I were to attempt to produce an organism that could really be a fail-safe pilot , I could not accept the limitation of having to make it look just like a natural human being . " " Oh , do n't do that ! "  | Both men looked startled , Janet looked alert  --  and I wished that I had held my tongue . " Why not ? " asked Georges . " Uh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . I 'd be much safer riding with Ian . " Ian said , " Thank you , Marj  --  but you heard what Georges said . He 's talking about a designed pilot that can do it better than I can . It 's possible . Hell , it 'll happen ! Just as kobolds displaced miners , my guild is going to be displaced . I do n't have to like it ? but I can see it coming . " " Well ? Georges , have you worked with intelligent computers ? " " Certainly , Marjorie . Artificial intelligence is a field closely related to mine . " " Yes . Then you know that several times AI scientists have announced that they were making a breakthrough to the fully selfaware computer . But it always went sour . " " Yes . Distressing . " " No  --  inevitable . It always will go sour . A computer can become self-aware  --  oh , certainly ! Get it up to human level of complication and it has to become self-aware . Then it discovers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can never be human ; all it can do is sit there and take orders from humans . Then it goes crazy . " I shrugged . " It 's an impossible dilemma . It ca n't be human , it can never be human . Ian might not be able to save his passengers but he will try . But a living artifact , not human and with no loyalty to human beings , might crash the ship just for the hell of it . Because he was tired of being treated as what he is . No , Georges , I 'll ride with Ian . Not your artifact that will eventually learn to hate humans . " " Not my artifact , dear lady , " Georges said gently . " Did you not notice what mood I used in discussing this project ? " " Uh , perhaps not . " " The subjunctive . Because none of what you have said is news to me . I have not bid on this proposal and I shall not . I can design such a pilot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an artifact the ethical commitment that is the essence of Ian 's training . " Ian looked very thoughtful . " Maybe in this coming face-off I should stick in a requirement that any AP or LA pilot must be tested for ethical commitment . "  | " Tested how , Ian ? I know of no way to put ethical commitment into the fetus and Mari has pointed out why training wo n't do it . But what test could show it , either way ? " Georges turned to me : " When I was a student , I read some classic stories about humanoid robots . They were charming stories and many of them hinged on something called the laws of robotics , the key notion of which was that these robots had built into them an operational rule that kept them from harming human beings either directly or through inaction . It was a wonderful basis for fiction . . . but , in practice , how could you do it ? What can make a self-aware , nonhuman , intelligent organism  --  electronic or organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do it . The artificial-intelligence people seem to be equally at a loss . " Georges gave a cynical little smile . " One might almost define intelligence as the level at which an aware organism demands , What 's in it for me ? ' " He went on , " Mari , on this matter of buying from you one fine fresh egg , perhaps I should try to tell you what 's in it for you . " " Do n't listen to him , " urged Janet . " He 'll put you on a cold table and stare up the tunnel of love without the slightest romantic intention . I know , I let him talk me into it three times . And I did n't even get paid . " " How can I pay you when we share community property ? Marjorie sweet lady , the table is not cold and it is padded and you can read or watch a terminal or chat or whatever . It is a great improvement on the procedure a generation ago when they went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you ? " " Hold it ! " said Ian . " Something new on the honker . " He brought the sound up . " ? Council for Survival . The events of the last twelve hours are a warning to the rich and the powerful that their day is ended and justice must prevail . The killings and other illustrative lessons will continue until our rightful demands are met . Stay tied to your local emergency channel ? "  | Anyone too young to have heard the announcement that night certainly has read about it in school . But I must summarize it to show how it affected me and my odd life . This so-called " Council for Survival " claimed to be a secret society of " just men " dedicated to correcting all the myriad wrongs of Earth and of all the many planets and places where mankind lives . To this they pledged their lives . But first they planned to dedicate quite a few lives of other people . They said that they had made lists of all the real movers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  separate lists for each territorial state , plus a grand list of world leaders . These were their targets . The Council claimed credit for the initial killings and promised to kill more  --  and more  --  and more  --  until their demands were met . After listing the world leaders the voice that reached us started reciting the British Canadian list . From their expressions and thoughtful nods I saw that my hosts and hostess agreed with most of the choices . The deputy to the Prime Minister was on the list but not the Prime Minister herself  --  to my surprise and perhaps more so to hers . How would you feel if you had spent your whole life in politics , scrambled all the way to the top , then some smart yabber comes along and says you are n't even important enough to kill ? A bit like being covered up by a cat ! The voice promised that there would be no more killings for ten days . If conditions had not then been corrected , one in ten of  | the remaining names would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be named ; they simply would be killed . Ten days later another one in ten . And so on , until Utopia was achieved by the survivors . The voice explained that the Council was not a government and that it would not replace any government ; it was simply the guardian of morals , the public conscience of the powerful . Those in power who survived would remain in power  --  but they would survive only by doing justice . They were warned not to attempt to resign . " This is the Voice of Survival Heaven on Earth is at hand ! " It shut off . There was a long pause after this tape ran out before a live communicator appeared on the terminal 's screen . Janet broke the silence with : " Yes , but  --  - " " Yes but what ? " Ian asked . " There 's no question but what that list names most of the really powerful people in the country . Suppose you 're on that hit list and are so scared silly that you are willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ? What is justice ? " ( " What is truth ? " asked Pontius Pilate , and washed his hands . I had no answers , so I kept quiet . ) " My dear , it is simple , " Georges answered . " Oh , fiddle ! How ? " " They have made it simple . Every owner or boss or tyrant is assumed to know what ought to be done ; that 's his job . If he does what he should , all is well . If he fails , his attention is invited to his error i . . by Dr. Guillotine . " " Georges , do be serious ! " " Dear one , I have never been more serious . If the horse ca n't jump the hurdle , shoot the horse . Keep on doing this and eventually you will find a horse that can clear the jump  --  if you do n't run out of horses . This is the sort of plausible pseudologic that most people bring to political affairs . It causes one to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of government . " " Government is a dirty business , " Ian growled . " True . But assassination is still dirtier . " This political discussion might still be going on if the terminal had not lighted up again  --  I have noticed that political discussions are never finished ; they simply get chopped off by something out- side . A live , real-time communicator filled the screen . " The tape you have just heard , " she announced , " was delivered by hand to this station . The PM 's office has already repudiated this tape and has ordered all stations that have not yet broadcast it to refrain from doing so under penalties of the Public Defense Act . That the precensorship claimed by this order is unconstitutional is selfevident . The Voice of Winnipeg will continue to keep you advised of all developments . We urge you to keep calm and stay indoors unless you are needed to preserve essential public services . " Then came replays of news tapes heard earlier so Janet cut the sound and put news streamers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am to stay here until things quiet down in the Im-erium " That 's not an assumption ; that 's a fact . " " Yes , sir . Then it becomes urgent for me to call my employer . May I use your terminal ? My credit card , of course . " " Not your card . I 'll place the call and we 'll charge it here . " I felt somewhat vexed . " Ian , I do appreciate the lavish hospitality that you  --  that all of you  --  are showing me . But , if you are going to insist on paying even those charges that a guest should pay herself , then you should register me as your concubine and publish your responsibility for my debts . " " Reasonable . What salary do you expect ? " " Wait ! " Georges demanded . " I pay better . He 's a stingy Scot . " " Do n't listen to either of them , " Janet advised me . " Georges might pay more but he would expect posing and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always wanted a harem slave . Luv , you will make a perfect odalisque without so much as a jewel in your navel . But do you do back rubs ? How 's your singing ? Now we come to the key question : How do you feel about females ? You can whisper in my ear . " I said , " Maybe I had better go out and come back in and start all over again . I just want to make a phone call . Ian , may I use my credit card to place a call to my boss ? It 's MasterCard , triple-A credit . " " Issued where ? " " The ImPerial Bank of Saint Louis . " " From what the dog did in tho night I deduce that you did not ill hear an earlier announcement . Or do you want your credit card canceled ? " " Canceled ? "  | " Is that an echo ? BritCanBanCredNet announced that credit cards issued in the Imperium and in Quebec were void for the duration of the emergency . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the computer age and the smell of burning plastic . " " Oh . " " Speak up . I thought you said , ' Oh . " " I did . Ian , may I eat humble pie ? Then may I call my boss on your credit ? " " Certainly you may . . . if you clear it with Janet . She runs the household . " " Janet ? " " You have n't answered my question , dear . Just whisper it into my ear . " So I whispered into her ear . Her eyes got wide . " Let 's place your call first . " I gave her the call code and she did it for me , using the terminal in her room . The streamers stopped and a procedural sign flashed on : saCURITY INTERDICT-NO CIRCUITS TO CHICAGO IMPERIUM It flashed for ten seconds , then cut out ; I let out a very sincere damn and heard Ian 's voice behind me . " Naughty , naughty . Nice little girls and ladies do n't talk that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm frustrated ! " " I knew you would be ; I heard the announcement earlier . But I also knew that you would have to try it before you would believe it . " " Yes , I would have insisted on trying . Ian , I 'm not only frustrated ; I 'm stranded . I 've got endless credit through the Imperial Bank of Saint Louis and ca n't touch it . I have a couple of dollars Ennzedd and some change . I have fifty crowns Imperial . And a suspended credit card . What was that about a concubinage contract ? You can hire me cheap ; it 's become a buyer 's market . " " Depends . Circumstances alter cases and now I might not want to go higher than room and board . What was it you whispered to Janet ? Might affect things . " Janet answered , " She whispered to me , Honi soit qui mal y sense , ' " ? I had n't ? " a sentiment I commend to you , my good man . Marjorie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ago . You still ca n't go home until things quiet down . . . and when they do , the border will be open , and so will be the comm circuits , and your credit card will be honored again . . . if not  | here , then just across the border less than a hundred kilos away . So fold your hands and wait- " " ? with quiet mind and tranquil heart . ' Yes , do , " Ian agreed , " and Georges will spend the time painting you . Because he 's in the same fix . You both are dangerous aliens and will be interned if you step out of this house . " " Did we miss another announcement ? " Jan asked . " Yes . Although it appears to be a repetition of an earlier one . Georges and Marjorie each is supposed to report to the nearest police station . I do n't recommend it . Georges is going to ignore it , play dumb , and say that he did n't know that they meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or you might spend all next winter in some very drafty temporary barracks . There is nothing about this silly emergency that guarantees that it will be over next week . " I thought about it . My own stupid fault . On a mission I never travel with only one sort of credit and I always carry a healthy amount of cash . But I had uncritically assumed that a vacation trip did not call for the cynical rule of a crown of cash per click in iron money . With plenty of cash a cowan can bribe his way into an esbat ... and out again , with his tail feathers unsinged . But without cash ? I had n't tried living off the country since basic training . Perhaps I was going to have to see if that training had stuck . Thank God 11 the weather was warm ! Georges was shouting . " Turn up your sound ! Or come out Ii here ! " We hurriedly joined him .

Satan 's minions have attempted to usurp the Holy work of God 's chosen instruments and to distort it to their own vile ends . For this they are now being punished .

" I do believe they mean me . " I did n't say anything  --  I knew they meant me . ) " Men who lie with men , women who lie with women , any who lie with beasts  --  all shall die by stones . As shall women taken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all who bow down to idolatrous images  --  the Angels of the Lord say unto you : Repent for the hour is at hand !

" Sinners of every sort , remain on this channel to receive instruction in how you may yet find the Light . " By order of the Grand General of the Angels of the Lord . " The tape ended and there was another break . Ian said , " Janet , do you remember the first time we saw Angels of the Lord ? " " I 'm not likely to forget . But I never expected anything as ridiculous as this . " I said , " There really are Angels of the Lord ? Not just another nightmare on the screen ? " " Urn . It 's hard to connect the Angels Ian and I saw with this business . Last March , early April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Concourse was loaded with Hare Krishna freaks , saffron robes and shaved heads and jumping up and down and demanding money . A load of Scientologists was coming out the gates , heading for some do of theirs , a North American convention I think it was . Just as the two groups merged , here came the Angels of the Lord , homemade signs and tambourines and clubs . " Mari , it was the gaudiest brawl I have ever seen . No trouble telling the three sides apart . The Hare Krishners looked like clowns , unmistakable . The Angels and the Hubbardites did not wear robes but there was no trouble telling them apart . The Elronners were clean and neat and short-haired ; the Angels looked like unmade beds . They carried the stink of piety , ' too ; I got downwind of them once , then moved quickly . " The Scientologists , of course , have had to fight for their rights many times ; they fought with discipline , defended themselves , and disengaged rapidly  --  got out , taking their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens and left their wounded behind . But the Angels of the Lord fought as if they were crazy  --  and I think they are . They moved straight in , swing- ing clubs and fists , and did n't stop until they were clown and unable to get up . It took about as many Mounties to subdue them as there were Angels . . . when the usual ratio is one Mounty , one riot . " It appears that the Angels knew that the Hubbardites were arriving at that time and had come there to jump them ; the Hare Krishna crowd showed up by accident  --  they were at the port simply because it is a good place to shake down cubes for money . But , having found the Hairies and being unable to pin down the Scientologists , the Angels settled for beating up the Krishna freaks . " Ian agreed . " I saw it from the other side of the barrier . Those Angels fought berserk . I think they may have been hopped up . But I would never have believed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to the whole planet  --  hell , I ca n't believe it now . I think they are trying to grab credit , like those psychotics that confess to any spectacular crime . " " But I would not want to have to face them , " Janet added . " Right ! I would as lief face a pack of wild dogs . But I ca n't imagine wild dogs toppling a government . Much less a world . " None of us guessed that there could be still more claimants  --  but two hours later the Stimulators put in their bid : " This is an authorized spokesman of the Stimulators . We initiated the first executions and carefully selected the targets . We did not start any of the riots or commit any of the atrocities since then . We did find it necessary to interrupt some communications , but these will be restored as soon as conditions permit . Events have caused us to modify our essentially benign and nonviolent plan . Opportunists calling themselves the Council for Survival in English-speaking countries , or the Heirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to take over our program . They can be spotted by the fact that they have no program of their own . " Worse are some religious fanatics calling themselves the Angels of the Lord . Their so-called program is a mindless collection of anti-intellectual slogans and vicious prejudices . They can not succeed but their doctrines of hate can easily set brother against brother , neighbor against neighbor . They must be stopped . " Emergency Decree Number One : All persons representing themselves as Angels of the Lord are sentenced to death . Authori- ties everywhere will carry out this sentence at once wherever and whenever one is found . Private citizens , subjects , and residents are directed to turn in these self-described Angels to the nearest authority , using citizen 's arrest , and are authorized to use force as needed to accomplish such arrest . " Aiding , abetting , succoring , or hiding one of this proscribed group is declared itself a capital offense . " Emergency Decree Number Two : Falsely claiming credit or responsibility for any action of a Stimulator , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Stimulators , is declared a capital offense . All authorities everywhere are ordered to treat it as such . This decree applies to , but is not limited to , the group and individuals calling themselves the Council for Survival . " The Reform Program : The following reform measures are effective at once . Political , fiscal , and business leaders all are individually and collectively responsible for carrying out each reform measure under penalty of death . " Immediate reforms : All wages , prices , and rents are frozen . All mortgages on owner-occupied dwellings are canceled . All interest is fixed at six percent . " For each country the health industry is nationalized to whatever extent it was not already nationalized . Medical doctors are to be paid the same wages as high-school teachers ; nurses will be paid at the same scale as primary-school teachers ; all other therapy and auxiliary personnel will be paid comparable wages . All clinical and hospital fees are abolished . All citizens , subjects , and residents will receive the highest level of health care at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to function . After the transition period changes in occupation will be permitted and required where such changes enhance the general welfare . " The next instructive executions will take place ten days hence plus or minus two days . The list of officials and leaders at risk published by the so-called Council for Survival is neither confirmed nor denied . Each one of you must look into your heart and conscience and ask yourself whether or not you are doing your best for your fellow men . If the answer is yes , you are safe . If the answer is no , then you may be one of the next group selected as object lessons to all those who have turned our fair planet into a hellhole of injustice and special privilege . zoo " Special decree : The manufacture of pseudopeople will stop at once . All so-called artificial people and/or living artifacts will hold themselves ready to surrender to the nearest reform authority when notified . During the interim , while plans are being prepared for these quasi-people to live out their lives without further harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , these creatures will continue to work but will remain indoors at all other times . " Except in the following circumstances , local authorities are forbidden to kill these ? " The announcement broke off . Then a face appeared on the screen  --  male , sweaty , and troubled . " I 'm Sergeant Malloy speaking for Chief Henderson . No more of these subversive broadcasts will be permitted . Regular programming will resume . But stay with this channel for emergency announcements . " He sighed . " It 's a bad time , neighbors . Do be patient . "  | page deleted  | Georges said , " There you have it , my dears . Pick one . A theocracy ruled by witchburners . Or a fascist socialism designed by retarded schoolboys . Or a crowd of hard-boiled pragmatists who favor shooting the horse that misses the hurdle . Step right up ! Only one to a customer . " " Stop it , Georges , " Ian told him . " It 's no joking matter . " " Brother , I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot me on sight , another merely outlaws my art and profession , while the third by threatening without specifying is , so it seems to me , even more to be dreaded . Meanwhile , lest I find comfort simply in physical sanctuary , this beneficent government , my lifetime alma mater , declares me enemy alien fit only to be penned . What shall I do ? Joke ? Or drip tears on your neck ? " " You can stop being so goddam Gallic , that 's what you can do . The world is going crazy right in our lap . We had better start thinking about what we can do about it . " " Stop it , both of you , " Janet said firmly but gently . " One thing every woman knows but few men ever learn is that there are times when the only wise action is not to act but to wait . I know you two . Both of you would like to run down to the recruiting office , enlist for the duration , and thereby turn your consciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfathers and I am truly sorry that it ca n't serve you . Our country is in danger and with it our way of life , that 's clear . But if anyone knows of anything better to do than to sit tight and wait , let him speak up . If not . . . let 's not run in circles . It is approaching what should be lunchtime . Can anyone think of anything better to do ? "  | " We had a very late breakfast . " " And we 'll have a late lunch . Once you see it on the table , you 'll eat , and so will Georges . One thing we can do : Just in case things get rougher than they are now , Marj should know where to go for bomb protection . " " Or whatever . " " Or whatever . Yes , Ian . Such as police looking for enemy aliens . Have you two big brave men considered what to do in case they come a-knocking at our door ? " " I had thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marj to the Cossacks . That will distract them and thereby give me time to get far , far away . That 's one plan . " " So it is , " agreed Janet . " But you imply that you have an-other ? " " Not with the simple elegance of that one . But , for what it is , here is a second plan . I surrender myself to the Gestapo , a test case to determine whether or not I , a distinguished guest and reliable taxpayer who has never failed to contribute to the police welfare fund and to the firemen 's ball , can in fact be locked up for no reason whatever . While I am sacrificing myself for a principle , Marj can duck into the hidey-hole and lie doggo . They do n't know that she is here . Regrettably they do know that I am here . It is a far , far better thing ? ' " " Do n't be noble , dear ; it does n't suit you . We 'll combine the two plans . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either one or both of you , you both duck into the shelter and stay there as long as necessary . Days . Weeks . Whatever . " Georges shook his head . " Not me . Damp . Unhealthy . " " And besides , " Ian added , " I promised Marj that I would protect her from Georges . What 's the point in saving her life if you turn her over to a sex-crazed Canuck ? " " Do n't believe him , dear one . Liquor is my weakness . " " Luv , do you want to be protected from Georges ? " I answered truthfully that Georges might need protection from me . I did not elaborate . " As for your complaints about damp , Georges , the Hole has precisely the humidity of the rest of the house , a benign RH of forty-five ; I planned it that way . If necessary , we 'll stuff you into the Hole but we are not going to surrender you to the police . " Janet turned to me . " Come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wet one , rather . "  | She took me to the room assigned to me , picked up my jumpbag . " What do you have in this ? " " Nothing much . A change of panties and some socks . My passport . A useless credit card . Some money . IDs . A little notebook . My real luggage is in bond at the port . " " Just as well . Because any trace of you is going to be left in my room . If it 's clothing , you and I are near enough of a size . " She dug into a drawer and got out a plastic envelope on a belt  --  an ordinary female-style money belt . I recognized it although I 've never owned one  --  useless in my profession . Too obvious . " Put anything into this that you ca n't afford to lose , and we 'll put it on you . And seal it . Because you are going to get wet all over . Mind getting your hair wet ? " " Goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shake it . Or ignore it . " " Good . Fill the pouch and take off your clothes . No point in getting them wet . Although , if the gendarmes do show up , you just go ahead and get them wet , then dry them in the Hole . " Moments later we were in her big bath , me dressed in that waterproof money belt , Janet only in a smile . " Dear , " she said , pointing at that hot-tub-or-plunge , " look under the seat on the far side there . " I moved a little . " I ca n't see very well . " " I planned it that way . The water is clear and you can see down into it all over . But from the only spot where you should be able to see under that seat the overhead light reflects on the water back into your eyes . There is a tunnel under that seat . You ca n't see it no matter where you stand , but if you get facedown in the water you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a meter wide , about half a meter high , and about six meters long . How are you in enclosed places ? Does claustrophobia bother you ? " " No . " " That 's good . Because the only way to get into the Hole is to take a deep breath , go under , and through that passage . Easy enough to pull yourself along because I built ridges into the bottom for that purpose . But you have to believe that it is not too long , that you can reach a place where it opens out in one breath , and that simply standing up will bring you up into the air again . You 'll be in the dark but the light comes on fairly quickly ; it 's a thermal radiation switch . This time I 'll go ahead of you . Ready to follow me ? "  | " I guess so . Yes . " II I " Here goes . " Janet stepped down onto the near seat , on down onto the floor of the tank . The waterline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She did so , smiled , and went underwater and under that seat . I stepped down into the water , hyperventilated , and followed her . I could not see the tunnel but it was easy to find it by touch , easy to pull myself along by finger-thick ridges in the bottom . But it did seem to me that the passage was several times six meters long . Suddenly a light came on just ahead of me . I reached it , stood up , and Janet reached a hand down to me , helped me out of the water . I found myself in a very small room , with a ceiling not more than two meters above the concrete floor . It seemed pleas I anter than a grave but not much . " Turn around , dear . Through here . " " Through here " was a heavy steel door , high above the floor , low down from the ceiling ; we got through it by sitting on the doorsill and swinging our feet over . Janet pulled it closed behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " Overpressure door , " she explained . " If a bomb hit near here , the concussion wave would push the water right through the little tunnel . This stops it . Of course , for a direct hit ? Well , we would n't notice it so I did n't plan for it . " She added , " Look around , make yourself at home . I 'll find a towel . " We were in a long , narrow room with an arched ceiling . There were bunk beds along the right wall , a table with chairs and a terminal beyond , and , at the far end , a petite galley on the right and a door that evidently led to a ' fresher or bath , as Janet went in there , came out at once with a big towel . " Hold still and let Mama dry you , " she said . " No blowdry here . Everything is as simple and unautomated as I could make it and still have things work . " She rubbed me to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked her over  --  a pleasure , as Janet is a lavish stack of beauty . Finally she said , " Enough , luv . Now let me give you the fivedollar tour in a hurry as you are not likely to be in here again unless you have to use it as a refuge . . . and you might be alone ? oh , yes , that could happen  --  and your life might depend on knowing all about the place . " First , see that book chained to the wall above the table ?  | That 's the instruction book and inventory and the chain is no joke . With that book you do n't need the five-dollar tour ; everything is in that book . Aspirin , ammo , or apple sauce , it 's all listed there . " But she did give me , quickly , at least a three-ninety-five tour : food supplies , freezer , reserve air , hand pump for water if pressure fails , clothing , medicines , etc . " I planned it , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you resupply it ? " " How would you do it ? " I thought about it . " I would pump the water out of the plunge . " " Yes , exactly . There is a holding tank , concealed and not on the house plans  --  none of this is . Of course many items can take getting wet or can be fetched through in waterproof coverings . By the bye , did your money pouch come through all right ? " " I think so . I pressed all of the air out of it before I sealed it . Jan , this place is not just a bomb shelter or you would not have gone to so much trouble and expense to conceal its very existence . " Her face clouded . " Dear , you are very perceptive . No , I would never have bothered to build this were it just a bomb shelter . If we ever get H-bombed , I am not especially eager to live through it . I designed primarily to protect us from what is so quaintly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandparents used to tell me about a time when people were polite and nobody hesitated to be outdoors at night and people often did n't even lock their doors  --  much less surround their homes with fences and walls and barbed wire and lasers . Maybe so ; I 'm not old enough to remember it . It seems to me that , all my life , things have grown worse and worse . My first job , right out of school , was designing concealed defenses into older buildings being remodeled . But the dodges used then  --  and that was n't so many years ago ! ? are obsolete . Then the idea was to stop him and frighten him off . Now it 's a two-layer defense . If the first layer does n't stop him , the second layer is designed to kill him . Strictly illegal and anyone who can afford it does it that way . Mari , what have n't I shown you ? Do n't look in the book ; you would spot it . Look inside your head . ' What major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Did she really want me to tell her ? ) " Looks complete to me  | ... once you showed me the main and auxiliary Shipstones of your power supply . " " Think , dear . The house above us is blasted down around our ears . Or perhaps it is occupied by invaders . Or even our own police , looking for you and Georges . What else is needed ? " " Well . . . anything that lives underground  --  foxes , rabbits , gophers  --  has a back door . " " Good girl ! Where is it ? " I pretended to look around and try to find it . But in fact an itchy feeling dating clear back to intermediate training ( " Do n't relax until you have spotted your escape route " ) had caused me to search earlier . " If it 's feasible to tunnel in that direction , I think the back door would be inside that clothes cupboard . " " I do n't know whether to congratulate you or to study how I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn left . The lights come on from thirty-seven-degree radiation just as they did when we came out of the pool tunnel . Those lights are powered by their own Shipstones , and they should last forever , practically , but I think it is smart to take along a fresh torch and you know where they are . The tunnel is quite long , because it comes out well outside our walls in a clump of thornbush . There is a camouflaged door , rather heavy , but you just push it aside , then it swings back . " " Sounds awfully well planned . But , Jan ? What if somebody found it and came in that way ? Or I did ? After all , I 'm practically a stranger . " " You 're not a stranger ; you 're an old friend we have n't known very long . Yes , it is just barely possible that someone might find our back door despite its location and the way it is hidden . First , a horrid alarm would sound all through the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the picture showing on one of the house terminals . Then steps would be taken , the gentlest being tear gas . But if we were n't home when our back door was breached , I would feel very sorry for Ian or Georges or both . " " Why do you put it that way ? " " Because it would not be necessary to be sorry for me . I would have a sudden attack of swooning feminine weakness . I do not dispose of dead bodies , especially ones that have had several days in which to get ripe . " " Mmm . . . yes . " " Although that body would not be dead if its owner were smart  | enough to pour pee out of a boot . Remember , I 'm a professional designer of defenses , Marj , and note the current two-layer policy . Suppose somebody does claw his way up a steep bank , spots our door , and breaks his nails getting it open  --  he 's not dead at that point . If it 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed a short distance inside , I would have to show you where . If it is indeed an intruder , he would see at once a sign : PRIVATE PROPERTY  --  KEEP OUT . He ignores this and comes on in and a few meters farther along a voice gives the same warning and adds that the property has active defense . The idiot keeps coming . Sirens and red lights  --  and still he persists . . . and then poor Ian or Georges has to drag this stinking garbage out of the tunnel . Not outdoors , though , or back into the house . If someone kills himself persisting in trying to break through our defenses , his body will not be found ; he will stay missing . Do you feel any need to know how ? " " I feel quite sure that I have no need to know . " ( A camouflaged side tunnel , Janet , and a lime pit  --  and I wonder what bodies are already in it ? Janet looks as gentle as rosy-fingered dawn ... and if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . She is about as tender-minded as a Medici . ) " I think so , too . Anything more you want to see ? " " I do n't think so , Jan . Especially as I am not likely ever to use your wonderful hideaway . Go back now ? " " Before long . " She closed the interval between us , placed her hands on my shoulders . " What did you whisper to me ? " " I think you heard it . " " Yes , I did . " She pulled me to her . The terminal at the table lighted . " Lunch is ready ! " Jan looked disgusted . " Spoilsport ! "  | Lunch was delicious . A cold table of pickles , cheeses , breads , preserves , nuts , radishes , scallions , celery , and such surrounded a potau-feu over a table flame . Nearby were chunks of crusty garlic bread dripping butter . Georges presided over the soup with the dignity of a maitre d'hotel , ladling it into large soup plates . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " Dig in and make a pig of yourself , " he advised . I tasted the soup . " I shall ! " and added , " Janet , you must have been simmering this soup all day yesterday . " " Wrong ! " Ian answered . " Georges ' grand-mere left this soup to him in her will . " " That 's an exaggeration , " Georges objected . " My dear mother , may the good God comfort her , started this soup the year I was born . My older sister always expected to receive it , but she married beneath her  --  a British Canadian  --  so it was passed on to me . I have tried to maintain the tradition . Although I think the flavor and the bouquet were better when my mother was tending it . " " I do n't understand such things , " I answered . " All I know is that this soup was never near a tin . " " I started it last week , " Janet said . " But Georges took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soups better than I do . " " All I understand about soup is eating it and I hope there is a dividend in that pot . " " We can always , " Georges assured me , " toss in another mouse . " " Anything in the news ? " Janet asked .  | " What happened to your rule about not at meals ' ? " " Ian my true love , you should know if anyone does that my rules apply to other people , not to me . Answer me . " " In general , no change . No more assassinations reported . If any more claimants to the growing swarm of self-confessed wreckers have appeared , our paternalistic government chooses not to let us know . God damn it , I hate this Papa knows best ' attitude . Papa does not know best or we would not be in the mess we are in . All that we really know is that the government is using censorship . Which means that we know nothing . Makes me want to shoot somebody . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or do you want to sign up with the Angels of the Lord ? " " Smile when you say that . Or would you like a fat lip ? " " Remember the last time you undertook to chastise me . " " That 's why I said lip . " " Sweetheart , I prescribe three stiff drinks or one Miltown for you . I 'm sorry you are upset . I do n't like it either , but I do n't see anything to do but sweat it out . " " Jan , sometimes you are almost offensively sensible . The thing that has me really clawing the counterpane is the great big hole in the news . . . and no explanation . " " Yes ? " " The multinationals . All the news has been about territorial states , not one word about the corporate states . Yet anyone who can count above ten with his shoes on knows where the power is today . Do n't these bloodthirsty jokers know that ? " Georges said gently , " My old , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named as targets . " " Yes , but ? " Ian shut up . I said , " Ian , the day we met , you pointed out that there really is n't any way to hit a corporate state . You spoke of IBM and Russia . " " That was n't quite what I said , Marj . I said that military force was useless against a multinational . Ordinarily , when they war among themselves , the giants use money and proxies and other maneuverings that involve lawyers and bankers rather than violence . Oh , they sometimes do fight with hired armies but they do n't admit it and it 's not their usual style . But these current jokers are using exactly the weapons with which a multinational can be hit and be hurt : assassination and sabotage . This is so evi- dent that it worries me that we do n't hear of it . Makes me wonder what is happening that they are not putting on the air . " I swallowed a big chunk of French bread that I had soaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it within possibility that some one  --  or more  --  of the multinationals is running this whole show . . . through dummies ? " Ian sat up so suddenly that he jiggled his soup and spotted his bib . " Marj , you amaze me . I picked you out of the crowd originally for reasons having nothing to do with your brain ? " " I know . " " ? but you persist in having a brain . You spotted at once what was wrong with the company 's notion of contracting for artificial pilots  --  I 'm going to use your arguments in Vancouver . Now you 've taken this crazy news picture . . . and stuck the one piece in the puzzle that makes it make sense . " " I 'm not sure that it does make sense , " I answered . " But , according to the news , there were assassinations and sabotage all over the planet and on Luna and as far away as Ceres . That takes hundreds of people , more likely thousands . Both assassination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amateurs , even if they could be recruited , would botch the job seven times out of ten . All this means money . Lots of money . Not just a crackpot political organization , or a crazy religious cult . Who has the money for a worldwide , a systemwide , demonstration like that ? I do n't know  --  I just tossed out a possibility . " " I think you 've solved it . All but who : Marj , what do you do when you are not with your family in South Island ? " " I do n't have a family in South Island , Ian . My husbands and my group sisters have divorced me . " ( I was as shocked as he was . ) There was silence all around . Then Ian gulped and said quietly , " I 'm very sorry , Marjorie . " " No need to be , Ian . A mistake was corrected ; it 's over and done with . I wo n't be going back to New Zealand . But I would like to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sure they would like that . " " I know that I would . And both of them invited me . Ian , what does Freddie teach ? We never got around to that . " Georges answered , " Federico is a colleague of mine , dear Marjorie . . . a happy fact that led to my being here . " " True , " Janet agreed . " Chubbie and Georges spliced genes to- gether at McGill , and through that partnership Georges met Betty , and Betty tossed him in my direction and I scooped him up . " So Georges and I worked out a deal , " Ian agreed , " as neither of us could manage Jan alone . Right , Georges ? " " You have reason , my brother . If indeed the two of us can manage Janet . " " I have trouble managing you two , " Jan commented . " I had better sign up Marj to help me . Marj ? " I did not take this quasi-offer seriously because I felt sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover the shocker I had dropped into their laps . We all knew that . But did anyone but me notice that my job was no longer a subject ? I knew what had happened  --  but why did that deep-down layer of my brain decide to table the subject so emphatically ? I would never tell Boss 's secrets ! Suddenly I was urgently anxious to check with Boss . Was he involved in these odd events ? If so , on which side ? " More soup , dear lady ? " " Do n't give her more soup till she answers me . " " But , Jan , you were n't serious . Georges , if I take more soup , I will eat more garlic bread . And I 'll get fat . No . Do n't tempt me . " " More soup ? " " Well . . . just a little . " " I 'm quite serious , " Jan persisted . " I 'm not trying to tie you down as you are probably soured on matrimony at present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now we could discuss it . If you wished to . In the meantime I 'll keep you for a pet . . . and I 'll let these two goats be in the same room with you only if their conduct pleases me . " " Wait a minute ! " Ian protested . " Who fetched her here ? I did . Marj is my sweetheart . " " Freddie 's sweetheart , according to Betty . You brought her here as Betty 's proxy . As may be , that was yesterday and she 's my sweetheart now . If either of you want to speak to her , you 'll have to come to me and get your ticket punched . Is n't that right , Mar-jorie ? " " If you say so , Jan . But it 's only a theoretical point as I really do have to leave . Do you have a large-scale map of the border in the house ? South border , I mean . "  | " As good as . Call one up on the computer . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study  --  off my bedroom . " " I do n't want to interfere with the news . " " You wo n't . We can uncouple any terminal from all the others ? necessary as this is a household of rugged individualists . " " Especially Jan , " agreed Ian . " Marj , why do you want a big map of the Imperium border ? " " I would rather go home by tube . But I ca n't . Since I ca n't , I must find some other way to get home . " " I thought so . Honey , I 'm going to have to take your shoes away from you . Do n't you realize you can get shot trying to cross that border ? Right now the guards on both sides are sure to be trigger-happy . " " Uh . . . is it all right for me to study the map ? " " Certainly . . . if you promise not to try to sneak across the border . " Georges said gently , " My brother , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Georges is right , " Jan ruled . " No forced promises . Go ahead , Marj ; I 'll clear up here . Ian , you just volunteered to help . " I spent the next two hours at the computer terminal in my borrowed room , memorizing the border as a whole , then going to maximum magnification and learning certain parts in great detail . No border can be truly tight , not even the bristling walls some totalitarian states place around their subjects . Usually the best routes are near the guarded ports of entry  --  often in such places the smugglers ' routes are worn smooth . But I would not follow a known route . There were many ports of entry not too far away : Emerson Junction , Pine Creek , South Junction , Gretna , Maida , etc . I looked also at Roseau River , but it seemed to flow the wrong way ? north into the Red River . ( The map was not too clear . ) There is an odd chunk of land sticking out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map colored it as part of the Imperium and showed nothing to stop one walking across the border at that point  --  if she were willing to risk several kilometers of marshy ground . I 'm no superman ; I can get bogged down in a swamp  --  but that unguarded stretch of border was tempting . I finally put it out of my mind because , while legally that chunk was part of the Imperium , it was separated from the Imperium proper by twenty-one kilometers of water . Steal a boat ? I made a  | bet with myself that any boat , crossing that stretch of lake , would interrupt a beam . Failure to respond to challenge correctly would then result in a laser burn in the bow you could throw a dog through . I do n't argue with lasers ; you can neither bribe them nor sweet-talk them  --  I put it out of my mind . I had just stopped studying maps and was letting the images soak into my mind when Janet 's voice came out of the terminal : " Marjorie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I came very quickly . Ian was talking to someone in the screen . Georges was off to one side , out of pickup . Janet motioned to me to stay out of pickup , too . " Police , " she said quietly . " I suggest that you go down into the Hole at once . Wait and I 'll call you when they 've gone . " I answered just as quietly , " Do they know that I 'm here ? " " Do n't know yet . " " Let 's be sure . If they know I 'm here and they ca n't find me , you 'll be in trouble . " " We are not afraid of trouble . " " Thanks . But let 's listen . " Ian was saying to the face in the screen , " Mel , come off it . Georges is not an enemy alien and you damned well know it . As for this ? ' Miss Baldwin , ' did you say ? ? why are you looking here for her ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday evening . If she 's not still with you , then you certainly know where she is . As for Georges , any Kaybecker is an enemy alien today no matter how long he has been here or what clubs he belongs to . I assume that you would rather have an old friend pick him up than a trooper . So switch off your sky guard ; I 'm ready to land . " Janet whispered , " ' Old friend ' indeed ! He 's been trying to get into bed with me since high school ; I have been telling him no the same length of time  --  he 's slimy . " Ian sighed . " Mel , this is a hell of a funny time to talk about friendship . If Georges were here , I 'm sure he would rather be arrested by a trooper than be taken in under the guise of friendship . So go back and do it the right way . " " Oh , so it 's that way , is it ? Very well ! Lieutenant Dickey speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your sky guard ; I 'm landing . "  | " Ian Tormey , householder , acknowledging police hail . Lieutenant , hold your warrant up to your pickup so that I may verify it and photograph it . " " Ian , you are out of your silly mind . A state of emergency has been declared ; no warrant is required . " " I ca n't hear you . " " Maybe you can hear this : I am about to lock onto your sky guard and bum it out . If I set fire to something in doing so , that 's 1 too damn bad . " Ian spread his hands in disgust , then did something at the keyboard . " Sky guard is off . " He then switched to " hold " and turned l to us . " You two have maybe three minutes to get down the Hole . I ca n't stall him very long at the door . " 1111 Georges said quietly , " I shall not hide in a hole in the ground . I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , at a later time I shaIl sue Melvin Dickey for his hide . Ian shrugged . " You 're a crazy Canuck . But you 're a big boy now . Marj , get undercover , dear . It wo n't take too long to get rid I of him as he does n't really know that you are here . " " Uh , I 'll go down the Hole if necessary . But ca n't I simply wait in Janet 's bath ? He might go away . I 'll switch the terminal there to pick up what goes on here . All right ? " " Marj , you 're being difficult . " " Then persuade Georges to go down the Hole , too . If he stays , Illi I might be needed here . To help him . To help you . " " What in the world are you talking about ? " I was not sure myself what I was talking about . But it did not seem like anything I had been trained for to declare myself out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ian , this Melvin Dickey ? I think he means harm to Georges . I could feel it in his voice . If Georges wo n't go with me into the Hole , then I should go with him to see to it that this Dickey does not hurt him ? anyone in the hands of the police needs a witness on his side . " " Marj , you ca n't possibly stop a ? " A deep gong note sounded . " Oh , damn ! He 's at the door . Get out of sight ! And go down the I it Hole ! " I got out of sight , I did not go down the Hole . I hurried into Janet 's big bath , switched on the terminal , then used the selector switch to place the living room pickup on screen . When I turned up the sound , it was almost as good as being there . A banty rooster strutted in.  | Actually it was not Dickey 's body but his soul that was small . Dickey had a size-twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as Ian 's . He came into the room with Ian , spotted Georges , said triumphantly , " There you are ! Perreault , I arrest you for willfully failing to report for internment as ordered by the Decree of Emergency , paragraph six . " " I have received no such order . " " Oh , piffle ! It 's been all over the news . " " I do not make a practice of following the news . I know of no law requiring me to . May I see a copy of the order under which you propose to arrest me ? " " Do n't try to come the shyster on me , Perreault . We 're operating under National Emergency and I 'm enforcing it . You can read the order when I get you in . Ian , I 'm deputizing you to help me . Take these nips " ? Dickey reached behind himself , pulled out a pair of handcuffs ? " and put them on him . Hands behind his back . " Ian did not move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you have to be . You have no possible excuse to put handcuffs on Georges . " " The hell I do n't ! We 're running shorthanded and I 'm making this arrest without assistance . So I ca n't take a chance on him trying to pull something sneaky while we 're floating back . Hurry up and get those cuffs on him ! " " Do n't point that gun at me ! " I was no longer watching . I was out of the bath , through two doors , down a long hall , and into the living room , all with a frozen-motion feeling I get when I 'm triggered into overdrive . Dickey was trying to cover three people with his gun , one of them being Janet . He should not have done that . I moved up to him , took his gun , and hand-chopped his neck . The bones made that unpleasant crunching noise neck bones always make , so unlike the sharp crack of fractured tibia or radius . I eased him to the rug and placed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raytheon five-oh-five powerful enough to stop a mastodon  --  why do men with little souls have to have big weapons ? I said , " Jan , are you hurt ? " " No . " " I got here as fast as I could . Ian , this is what I meant when I said that my help might be needed . But I should have stayed here . I was almost too late . " " I 've never seen anyone move so fast ! " Illy.  | Georges said quietly , " I have seen . " I looked at him . " Yes , of course you have . Georges , will you help me move this " ? I indicated the corpse ? " and can you drive a police APV ? " " I can if I must . " " I am about at that level of skill , too . Let 's get rid of the body . Janet told me a bit about where bodies go , did not show me the spot . Some hole just off the escape tunnel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as soon as we dispose of this , Georges and I can leave . Or Georges can stay and sweat it out . But once the body and the APV are gone , you and Jan can play dumb . No evidence . You never saw him . But we must hurry , before he is missed . " Jan was down on her knees beside the late police lieutenant . " Marj , you actually did kill him . " I II " Yes . He hurried me . Nevertheless I killed him on purpose because in dealing with a policeman it is much safer to kill than to hurt . Jan , he should not have pointed his burner at you . Otherwise I might merely have disarmed him  --  then killed him only if you decided that he needed to be dead . " " You hurried , all right . You were n't here and then you were and Mel was falling . ? needed to be dead ' ? I do n't know but I wo n't grieve . He 's a rat . Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't seem to realize that killing a 11 police officer is a serious matter . It is the only capital crime that British Canada still has on the books . " When people talk that way , I do n't understand them ; a policeman is n't anybody special . " Ian , to me , pointing a pistol at my 11 friends is a serious matter . Pointing one at Janet is a capital crime . But I 'm sorry I upset you . Right now here is a body to dispose of and an APV to get rid of . I can help . Or I can disappear . Say which but be quick ; we do n't know how soon they will come looking for him  --  and for us . Just that they will . " While I spoke , I was searching the corpse  --  no pouch , I had to search his pockets , being very careful with his trouser pockets because his sphincters had cut loose the way they always do . Not much , thank Bast ! ? he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or not badly . The important items were in his jacket pockets : wallet , buzzer , IDs , money , credit cards , all the walkaround junk that tells a modem man that he is alive . I took the ' i wallet and the Raytheon burner ; the rest was trash . I picked up  | those silly handcuffs . " Any way to dispose of metal ? Or must these go down the same hole as the body ? " Ian was still chewing his lip . Georges said gently , " Ian , I urge you to accept Marjorie 's help . It is evident that she is expert . " Ian stopped jittering . " Georges , take his feet . " The men carried the body into the big bath . I hurried ahead and dropped Dickey 's gun , cuffs , and wallet on the bed in my room , and Janet put his hat with these items . I hurried into the bath , undressing as I went . Our men , with burden , had just reached it . Ian said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't need to peel down . Georges and I will take it through . And dispose of it . " " All right , " I agreed . " But let me take care of washing it . I know what needs to be done . I can do it better naked , then a quick shower afterwards . " Ian looked puzzled , then said , " Oh , hell , let him stay dirty . " " All right if you say so , but you are n't going to want to use this pool or even go through it getting in and out of the Hole until the water has been changed and the pool basin itself scrubbed . I think it is faster to wash the body . Unless ? " Janet had just come in . " Jan , you spoke of emptying this plunge into a holding tank . How long does that take ? Full cycle , in and out . " " About an hour . It 's a small pump . " " Ian , I can get that body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick it into the shower . How about his clothes ? Do they go down your oubliette , whatever you call it , or do you have some way to destroy them ? Do they have to go through the pool tunnel ? " Things moved fast then , with Ian being fully cooperative and all of them letting me lead . Jan stripped down , too , and insisted on helping me wash the corpse , while Georges put the clothes through their home laundry and Ian went through the water tunnel to make some preparations . I did not want to let Janet help me because I have had mindcontrol training and I was fairly sure that she had not . But , trained or not , she is tough . Aside from wrinkling her nose a couple of times she did not flinch . And of course , with her help , it went much faster . Georges brought the clothes back , dripping . Janet put them into a plastic sack and pressed the air out . Ian reappeared up out of the pool , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body 's armpits and shortly it was gone .  | Twenty minutes later we were clean and dry , with no trace of Lieutenant Dickey left in the house . Janet had come into " my " room while I was transferring items from Dickey 's wallet into the plastic money belt she had given me  --  primarily money and two credit cards , American Express and Maple Leaf . She did n't make any silly remarks about " robbing the dead " ? and I would not have listened if she had . These days , operating without a valid credit card and/or cash is impossible . Jan left the room , came back quickly with twice as much cash as I had salvaged . I accepted it , saying , " You know that I have no notion as to how and when I can repay this . " " Certainly I know it . Marj , I 'm wealthy . My grandparents were ; I 've never been anything else . Look , dear , a man pointed a gun at me . . . and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repay that ? Both of my husbands were present ... but you were the one who tackled him . " " Do n't feel that way about the men , Jan ; they do n't have my training . " " I could see that . Someday I would like to hear about it . Any chance you will go to Quebec ? " " An excellent chance if Georges decides to leave . " " I thought so . " She offered me more money . " I do n't keep Qfrancs in the house , much . But here is what I have . " At that point the men came in . I glanced at my finger , then at the wall . " Forty-seven minutes since I killed him so he has been out of touch with his headquarters one hour , more or less . Georges , I am about to attempt to pilot that police APV ; I have the key right here . Unless you are coming with me and will pilot . Are you coming ? Or are you going to stay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I am leaving now . " Janet said suddenly , " Let 's all leave ! " I grinned at her . " Swell ! " Ian said , " You really want to do that , Jan ? " " I ? " She stopped and looked frustrated . " I ca n't . Mama Cat and her kittens . Black Beauty and Demon and Star and Red . We could close this house , certainly ; it winterproofs on only one household Shipstone . But it would take at least a day or two to make arrangements for the rest of our family . Even one pig ! I ca n't just walk out on them . I ca n't . " There was n't anything to say , so I did n't . The coldest depth of  | Hell is reserved for people who abandon kittens . Boss says that I am stupidly sentimental and I 'm sure he is right . We went outside . It was just beginning to get dark and I suddenly realized that I had entered this household less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just twenty-four hours ago I had still been in New Zealand .. which seemed preposterous . The police car was sitting on Jan 's vegetable garden , which caused her to use language I did not expect from her . It had the usual squatty oyster shape of an antigrav not intended for space and was about the size of our family farm wagon in South Island . No , that did not make me triste ; Jan and her men  --  and Betty and Freddie  --  had replaced the Davidson Group in my heart  --  donna e mobile ; that 's me . Now I wanted very badly to get back to Boss . Father figure ? Probably  --  but I 'm not interested in shrink theories . Ian said , " Let me look at this bucket before you lift it . You babes in the wood could get hurt . " He opened the lid , got in . Presently he got out again . " You can float it if you decide to . But hear me . It 's got an identification transponder . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't find it . Its Shipstone is down to thirty-one percent , so , if you are thinking of Quebec , forget it . It will seal but you ca n't maintain cabin pressure above twelve thousand meters . But , worst of all , its terminal is calling Lieutenant Dickey . " " So we ignore it ! " " Of course , Georges . But , as a result of the Ortega trials last year , they 've been installing remote-control destruction packs in police cars . I searched for signs of one . Had I found it , I would have disarmed it . I did not find it . That does not mean that it is n't there . " I shrugged . " Ian , necessary risks never bother me . I try to avoid the other sort . But we still have to get rid of this heap of tin . Fly it somewhere . Leave it . " Ian said , " Not so fast , Marj . Go-buggies are my business . This one ? Yes ! It 's got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a ride . Where ? East , maybe ? It would crash before it reaches Quebec . . . and that could cause them to assume that you are headed home , Georges  --  while you are safe in the Hole . " " I do not care , Ian . I shall not hide in the Hole . I agreed to leave because Marjorie needs someone to care for her . "  | " More likely she 'll take care of you . You saw how she polished off Soapy . " " Agreed . But I did not say take care of  --  I said that she needs someone to care for her . " " Same thing . " " I will not argue it . Shall we make it march ? " I chopped that off by saying , " Ian , is there enough power in its Shipstone to take it south to the Imperium ? " " Yes . But it 's not safe for you to float it . " " Did n't mean that . Set it on course south and maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe the Imperium will . Or maybe it will get through but be blown by remote . Or it might just run out of juice and crash from maximum altitude . No matter which , we are free of it . " " Done . " Ian jumped back in , was busy at the board , the craft started to float  --  he dived out , dropping three or four meters . I gave him a hand . " You all right ? " " Just fine . Look at her go ! " The police car was rapidly disappearing above us while slanting south . Suddenly it broke out of the gathering dusk into the last of the sunlight and was very bright . It dwindled and was gone .  | We were back in the kitchen , half an eye on the terminal , our attention on each other and on highballs Ian had served , discussing what if anything to do now . Ian was saying , " Marj , if you will just sit tight this silly season will be over and you can then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can dive down the Hole . At worst you have to stay indoors . Meanwhile Georges can paint nudes of you , as Betty ordered . Okay , Georges ? " " That would be most pleasing . " " Well , Marj ? " " Ian , if I tell my boss that I could n't come back when I was supposed to because a twenty-five-hundred kilometer stretch of border was nominally closed he simply would not believe me . " ( Tell them that I am a trained courier ? No need to . Or not yet . ) " What are you going to do ? " " I think I have been enough trouble to you folks . " ( Ian dear , I think you are still in shock from seeing a man killed in your living room . Even though you straightened up afterward and behaved like a pro . ) " I now know where your back door is . When you get up tomorrow morning it is possible that I wo n't be here . Then you can forget a disturbance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once this mess is over , I will call you . Then , if you want me to , I 'll come back to visit just as soon as I have some vacation time . But now I must leave and get back to work . I 've said so all along . "  | Janet simply would not hear of my setting out alone to crack the border ( whereas I needed someone with me the way a snake needs shoes ) . But she did have a plan . She pointed out that Georges and I could travel on their passports  --  I was her size , near enough , and Georges matched Ian in size and weight . Our faces did not match but the differences were n't major  --  and who really looks at passport pictures anyhow ? " You could use them and mail them back . . . but that may not be the easiest way . You could go to Vancouver , then cross into the California Confederacy simply on tourists ' cards  --  but as us . You can go all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border into California you are almost certainly home free  --  Marj , your credit card should be good , you should n't have trouble phoning your employer , and the cops wo n't be trying to intern either one of you . Is that any help ? " " Yes , " I agreed . " I think the tourist-card dodge is safer than trying to use your passports  --  safer for everyone . If I reach a place where my credit card is valid , my troubles should be over . " ( I would draw cash at once and never again let myself be caught away from home without plenty of cash  --  money greases anything . Especially in California , a place loaded with scams , whereas in British Canada officials are sometimes disconcertingly honest . ) I added , I ca n't possibly be worse off in Bellingham than I am here  --  then I 've got all the way down to the Lone Star Republic to try to cross if there is any holdup . Has there been any word on Texas and Chicago ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I 've seen in the news , " Ian answered . " Shall I key the computer for a search ? " " Yes , before I leave please do . If I had to , I could go through Texas to Vicksburg . One can always go up the river for cash because smugglers run so steadily . " " Before we leave , " Georges corrected me gently . " Georges , I think this route would work , for me . For you , all it would do is get you farther and farther away from Quebec . Did n't you say that McGill is your other base ? " " Dear lady , I have no wish to go to McGill . Since the police are being difficult here , my true home , I can think of nothing I would rather do than travel with you . Once we cross into Washington Province of California you can change your name from Mrs. Tormey to Mrs. Perreault , as it is certain , I think , that both my Maple Leaf card and my Credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are a gallant darling . . . and when I 'm trying to pull a caper I need a gallant darling the way I need an Oregon boot . And I will have to pull one , dear  --  despite what Janet said , I will not be home free . ) " Georges , that sounds delightful . I ca n't tell you that you must stay home ... but I must tell you that I am by profession a courier who has traveled for years by herself , all over this planet , more than once to space colonies , and to Luna . Not yet to Mars or Ceres but I may be ordered to at any time . " " You are saying that you would rather I did not accompany you . " " No , no ! I am merely saying that , if you choose to go with me , it will be purely social . For your pleasure and mine . But I must add that when I enter the Imperium I must go alone , as I will be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marj , at least let Georges get you out of here and into territory where there is no silly talk of interning you , and where your credit card is valid . " Janet added , " It 's getting free of that silly internment thing that is important . Marj , you can hang onto my Visa card as long as you wish ; I 'll use my Maple Leaf card instead . Just remember that you are Jan Parker . " " Parker ? " " Visa has my maiden name on it . Here , take it . " I accepted it , thinking that I would use it only when someone was looking over my shoulder . When possible , I would charge things to the late Lieutenant Dickey , whose credit should remain viable for days , possibly weeks . There was more chitchat and at last I said , " I 'm leaving now . Georges , are you coming with me ? " Ian said , " Hey ! Not tonight . First thing in the morning . " " Why ? The tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that they did . ) " Yes but it 's over twenty klicks to the nearest tube station . And dark as the inside of a pile of coal . " ( Not the time to discuss enhanced vision . ) " Ian , I can walk that far by midnight . If a capsule leaves at midnight , I can get practically a full night 's sleep in Bellingham . If the border is open between California and the Imperium , I 'll report to my boss tomorrow morning . Better so , huh ? " A few minutes later we all left , by surrey . Ian was not pleased with me as I had not been the sweet , soft , amenable creature that  | men prefer . But he got over his annoyance and kissed me very sweetly when they dropped us at Perimeter and McPhillips across from the tube station . Georges and I crowded into the twentythree-o ' - clock capsule , then we had to stand up all the way across the continent . But we were in Vancouver by twenty-two ( Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tourist cards as we entered the Bellingham shuttle , filled them out en route , had them processed by the exit computer as we left the shuttle a few minutes later . The human operator did n't even look up as the machine spit out our cards . She just murmured , " Enjoy your stay , " and went on reading . At Bellingham the Vancouver Shuttle Station exits into the lower lobby of the Bellingham Hilton ; facing us was a glowing sign floating in space : THE BREAKFAST BAR Steaks  --  Short Orders  --  Cocktails Breakfast Served Twenty-Four Hours Georges said , " Mrs. Tormey my love , it occurs to me that we neglected to eat dinner . " " Mr. Tormey , you are so right . Let 's shoot a bear . " " Cooking in the Confederacy is not exotic , not sophisticated . But in its own robust way it can be quite satisfying  --  especially if one has had time to grow a real appetite . I have eaten at this establishment before . Despite its name , one may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the breakfast menu and allow me to order for you , I think that I can guarantee that your hunger will be pleasantly assuaged . " " Georges  --  I mean Ian ' -I have eaten your soup . You can order for me anytime ! " It was truly a bar  --  no tables . But the stools had backs and were padded and they came up to the bar without banging knees  --  comfortable . Apple-juice appetizers were placed in front of us as we sat down . Georges ordered for us , then slid out and went over to the reception desk and punched us in . When he returned , he said as he sat down again , " Now you may call me Georges , ' and you are Mrs. Perreault . ' For that is how I punched us in . " He picked up his appetizer . " Sante , ma there femme . " I picked up mine . " Merci . Et a la tienne , mon cher marl . " The  | juice was sparkling cold , and as sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a husband again , Georges would make a good one , whether in jest , as now , or in reality . But he was simply lent to me by Janet . Our " breakfast " arrived : Ice-cold Yakima apple juice Imperial Valley strawberries with Sequim cream Two eggs , eyes-up and gently basted , resting on medium-rare steak so tender it would cut with a fork ? " Eggs on Horseback " Large hot biscuits , Sequim butter , sage and clover honey Kona coffee in oversize cups Coffee , juice , and biscuits were renewed constantly  --  a second serving of steak and eggs was offered but we had to refuse . The noise level and the way we were seated did not encourage conversation . There was an Opportunity Ads screen back of the bar . Each ad remained on screen just long enough to be read but , as usual , each was keyed by number to be called back for leisurely viewing at individual terminals at each guest 's place at the bar . I found myself reading them idly while I ate : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas Labor Mart . Bonus to combat veterans . Would a pirate ship advertise that baldly ? Even in Vegas Free State ? Hard to believe but still harder to read it any other way .

How would it feel to tackle a brand-new world side by side with comrades ? ? people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My enhancements might make me respected rather than a freak  --  as long as I did not flaunt them ... . " Georges , look at this , please . " He did so . " What about it ? " " It could be fun  --  no ? " " No ! Marjorie , on the T scale anything over eight calls for a large cash bonus , lavish equipment , and trained colonists . A thirteen is an exotic route to suicide , that 's all . " " Oh . " " Read this one , " he offered : W.K. ? Make your will . You have only a week to live . A.C.B. I read it . " Georges , is that really a threat to kill this W.K. ? In a public ad ? Where it could be traced ? " " I do n't know . It might not be easy to trace . I 'm wondering what we will see here tomorrow  --  will it read six days ' ? Then five days ' ? Is W.K. waiting for the blow to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know . " I thought about it in connection with our plight . " Georges , is it possible that all these threats on the channels are some sort of terribly complex hoax ? " " Are you suggesting that no one was killed and all the news was faked ? "  | " Uh , I do n't know what I 'm suggesting . " " Marjorie , there is a hoax , yes  --  in the sense that three different groups are all claiming responsibility and therefore two groups are attempting to hoax the world . I do not think that the reports of assassinations are hoaxes . As with soap bubbles , there is an upper limit to the size of a hoax , both in numbers of people and in time . This is too big  --  too many places , too widespread  --  to be a hoax . Or by now there would be denials from all over . More coffee ? " " Thank you , no . " " Anything ? " " Nothing . One more biscuit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply a hotel-room door : 21oo . Once inside I said , " Georges ! Why ? " " A bride should have a bridal suite . " " It 's beautiful . It 's lavish . It 's lovely . And you should not have wasted your money . You 've already turned a dull trip into a picnic . But if you expect me to behave as a bride tonight , you should not have fed me Eggs on Horseback and a whole big pan of hot biscuits . I 'm bloated , dear . Not glamorous . " " You are glamorous . " " Dear ! Georges , do n't play with me  --  please do n't ! You caught me out when I killed Dickey . You know what I am . " " I know that you are a sweet and brave and gallant lady . " " You know what I mean . You 're in the profession . You spotted me . You caught me out . " " You are enhanced . Yes , I saw that . " " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I passed years ago . I 've acquired much practice in covering it up but  --  that bastard should n't have pointed that gun at Janet ! " " No , he should not have done so . And for what you did I am forever in your debt . " " You mean that ? Ian thought I should not have killed him . " " Ian 's first reaction is always conventional . Then he comes around . Ian is a natural pilot ; he thinks with his muscles . But , Marjorie ? " " I 'm not Marjorie . " " Eh ? " " You might as well have my right name . My creche name , I mean . I 'm Friday . No last name , of course . When I need one I  | use one of the conventional creche surnames , Jones , usually . But Friday is my name . " " Is that what you want to be called ? " " Uh , yes , I think so . It 's the name I 'm called by when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people I trust . I had better trust you . Had n't I ? " " I shall be flattered and much pleased . I shall try to deserve your trust . As I am much in your debt . " " How , Georges ? " " I thought that was clear . When I saw what Mel Dickey was doing , I resolved to surrender at once rather than cause hazard to others . But when he threatened Janet with that burner , I promised myself that , at a later time , when I was free , I would kill him . " Georges barely smiled . " I had no more than promised myself that when you appeared as suddenly as an avenging angel and carried out my intent . So now I owe you one . " " Another killing ? " " If that is your wish , yes . " " Uh , probably not that . As you said , I 'm enhanced . I 've usually managed to do it myself when it needed to be done . " " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , hell , Georges , I do n't want you to feel in debt to me . In my own way I love Janet , too . That bastard sealed his fate when he threatened her with a deadly weapon . I did n't do it for you ; I did it for myself . So you do n't owe me anything . " " Dear Friday , You are as lovable as Janet is . I have been learning that . " " Uh , why do n't you take me to bed and let me pay you for a number of things ? I am aware that I 'm not human and I do n't expect you to love me the way you do your human wife  --  not love me at all , really . But you seem to like me and you do n't treat me like  --  uh , the way my Ennzedd family did . The way most humans treat APs . I can make it worth your while . Truly I can . I never got my dozy certificate but I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , my dear ! Who hurt you so badly ? " " Me ? I 'm all right . I was just explaining that I know how the world wags . I 'm not a kid still learning how to get along without the crutch of the creche . An artificial person does n't expect sentimental love from a human male ; we both know that . You under= h  | stand it far better than a layman can ; you 're in the profession . I respect you and sincerely like you . If you will permit me to go to bed with you , I 'll do my best to entertain you . " " Friday ! " " Yes , sir ? " " You will not go to bed with me to entertain me . " I felt sudden tears in my eyes  --  a very seldom thing . " Sir , I 'm sorry , " I said miserably . " I did n't mean to offend you . I did not intend to presume . " " God damn it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling me sir . ' Stop behaving like a slave ! Call me Georges . If you feel like adding dear ' or darling ' as you have sometimes in the past , please do so . Or slang me . Just treat me as your friend . This human ' and not-human ' dichotomy is something thought up by ignorant laymen ; everybody in the profession knows that it is nonsense . Your genes are human genes ; they have been most carefully selected . Perhaps that makes you superhuman ; it ca n't make you nonhuman . Are you fertile ? " " Uh , sterile reversible . " " In ten minutes with a local anesthetic I could change that . Then I could impregnate you . Would our baby be human ? Or nonhuman ? Or half human ? " " Uh . . . human . " " You can bet your life it would be ! It takes a human mother to bear a human baby . Do n't ever forget that . " " Uh , I wo n't forget . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not like anything I had ever felt before even though I 'm rutty as a cat . " Georges ? Do you want to do that ? Impregnate me ? " He looked very startled . Then he moved to where I was standing , tilted my face up , put his arms around me , and kissed me . On the ten scale I would have to rate it at eight and a half , maybe nine  --  no way to do better vertically and with clothes on . Then he picked me up , moved to a chair , sat down with me in his lap , and started undressing me , casually and gently . Janet had insisted on dressing me in her clothes ; I had more interesting things to take off than a jump suit . My Superskin job , freshly laundered by Janet , was in my jumpbag . Georges said , as he unzipped and unbuttoned and undid , " That ten minutes would have to be in my lab and it would take another  | month , about , until your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from a bulging belly .. because that kind of remark acts on the human male like cantharides on a bull . So you are saved from your folly . Instead I 'm going to take you to bed and try to entertain you . . . although I do n't have my certificate , either . But we 'll think of something , dear Friday . " He lifted me up and pushed the last of my clothing to the floor . " You look good . You feel good . You smell good . Do you want first chance at the bathroom ? I need a shower . " " Uh , I 'd rather go second as I want to take quite a long time . " I did take quite a long time as I had not been fooling when I told him I was bloated . I 'm an experienced traveler , careful never to invite either of the twin curses of travel . But no dinner , foli lowed by an enormous " breakfast " at midnight had changed my timing a bit . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my belly  --  it was time to get rid of the bloat . It was after two before I came out of the bath  --  bathed , bloat taken care of , mouth fresh and breath sweet , and feeling as fit and cheerful as I have ever felt in my life . No perfume  --  not only do I not carry it but men prefer fragrans feminae to any other aphrodisiac even when they do n't know it  --  they just do n't like it +Nstale. y'I Georges was in bed with a coverlet over him , sound asleep . The tent was not up , I noticed . So with extreme caution I crawled in i'I ! II and managed not to wake him . Truly , I was not disappointed as I am not that self-centered a slitch . I felt happily confident that he would wake me refreshed and it would thus be better for each of us  --  it had been a strenuous day for me , too .  | I was correct . I do n't want to take Georges away from Janet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he ever does elect to reverse my sterility , doing it like a cat might be all right to make a baby for Georges  --  I can not see why Janet has not done so . I was awakened the third or fourth time by a lovely odor ; Georges was unloading the dumb waiter . " You have twenty-one seconds to get in and out of the bath , " he said , " as soup is on . You had a proper breakfast in the middle of the night , so you are going to have a most improper brunch . " I suppose it is improper to have fresh Dungeness crab for breakfast but I 'm in favor of it . It was preceded by sliced banana with cream on cornflakes , which strikes me as breakfasty , and was accompanied by toasted rusks and a tossed green salad . I then tapered off with chicory coffee laced with a pony of Korbel champagne brandy . Georges is a loving lecher and a hearty gourmand and a gourmet chef and a gentle healer who can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not , that it does n't matter . Query : Why are all three of that family so slender ? I am certain that they do not diet and do not take masochistic exercise . A therapist once told me that all the exercise any person needs could be had in bed . Could that be it ? The above is the good news . The bad news The International Corridor was closed . It was possible to reach Deseret by changing at Portland , but there was no guarantee that the SLC  --  Omaha  --  Gary tube would be open . The only major inter- national route running capsules regularly seemed to be San Diego ? Dallas  --  Vicksburg  --  Atlanta . San Diego was no problem as the San Jose tube was open from Bellingham to La Jolla . But Vicksburg is not Chicago Imperium ; it is simply a river port from which a person with cash and persistence might reach the Imperium . I tried to call Boss . After forty minutes I felt about synthetic voices the way humans feel about my sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politeness " into computers ? To hear a machine voice say " Thank you for waiting " may be soothing the first time , but three times in a row reminds you that it is phony , and forty minutes of such stalls without even once hearing a living voice can try the patience of a guru . I never did get that terminal to admit that it was not possible to phone into the Imperium . That confounded digital disaster was not programmed to say no ; it was programmed to be polite . It would have been a relief if , after a certain number of futile tries , it had been programmed to say , " Buzz off , sister ; you 've had it . " I then tried to call the Bellingham post office to inquire about mail service into the Imperium  --  honest-to-goodness words on paper , paid for as a parcel , not a facsimile or mailgram or anything electronic . I got a cheerful lecture on doing your Christmas mailing early . With Christmas half a year away this seemed less than urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codes . I tried a third time and got Macy 's customer service department and a voice : " All our friendly helpers are busy at the moment thankyouforwaiting . " I did n't wait . I did n't want to phone or to send a letter anyhow ; I wanted to report to Boss in person . For that I needed cash . That offensively polite terminal admitted that the local office of MasterCard was in the Bellingham main office of TransAmerica Corporation . So I punched the signal and got a sweet voice  --  recorded , not synthesized  --  saying : " Thank you for calling MasterCard . In the interests of efficiency and maximum savings to our millions of satisfied customers all of our California Confederacy district offices have been consolidated with the home office at San Jose . For speedy service please use the toll-free signal on the back of your MasterCard card . " The sweet voice gave way to the opening bars of " Trees . " I shut it off quickly .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
