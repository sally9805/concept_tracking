It seems that Wendy got to the bottom of a box of Cracker Jack one day and found no free toy , as advertised . Recalls her mother : " She was so sad-faced . " Wendy wrote to Borden to complain , but received no response . So she and her father composed a complaint asking the court for a replacement box of Cracker Jack and $19 to cover court costs . Says Wendy in her suit : " I feel since I bought their product because of their claim , they broke a contract with me . " Borden officials pleaded for a little understanding , pointing out that since 1912 they have packed some 16 billion little prizes in those boxes ; they sent Wendy a letter of apology and a coupon good for one free box of Cracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope next time they 'll have toys in the Cracker Jack . " Says her father : " It was just meant to be a nice , educational experience for her . " Not to mention for Borden.
