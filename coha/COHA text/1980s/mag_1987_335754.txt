" There 's going to be a lot of celebrating in Miami , " predicted a jubilant Roberto Arguello . The president of the Nicaraguan American Bankers Association was exulting last week because the Reagan Administration had just modified its immigration policy to provide asylum for 200,000 Nicaraguan exiles , including 75,000 in South Florida . <P> Exultation was not shared , however , by the legions of other Central American refugees the Administration refuses to welcome . Democratic Congressman John Joseph Moakley of Massachusetts , sponsor of legislation to prevent the deportation of Salvadorans and Nicaraguans , accused the Administration of " playing politics with people 's lives " in helping Nicaraguans ( reflecting U.S. aversion to the Sandinista regime ) while ignoring ; Salvadorans ( to avoid suggesting that they might have reason to flee from a government the U.S. supports ) . Said Moakley : " If El Salvador were under Communist leadership , they 'd have the welcome wagons out waiting . "
