The Socialist-led coalition of Italian Premier Bettino Craxi is moving ahead with an austerity package that it hopes will check government spending and curb double-digit inflation . The program , involving sharp cuts in social benefits and a new round of taxation , has already aroused considerable opposition , mostly from powerful labor unions and the Communist Party . But Craxi ' s two-month old government appears determined to push ahead , despite the unpopularity of such a program by French Socialists . " The right way is . . . substantially that which the French government has already undertaken , " Labor Minister Gianni de Michelis , the second-ranking Socialist in the government , recently told an Italian newspaper . The economy was in such bad shape that " there was no other choice " to the new program , he added . But many observers and economists are skeptical as to whether this program will fare any better than others that preceded it . The spending cuts in social security costs like health care , pensions and family benefits are new . But there are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much mutilation and whether the proposals go far enough to correct the imbalances plaguing the economy . Economic statistics are not encouraging . This year GNP is expected to decline - for the third year in a row - by more than 1 percent . Unemployment has reached record levels of more than 10 percent . The annual inflation rate is expected to be more than 15 percent , above this year ' s 13 percent target . And the 1983 budget deficit is estimated at about $58 billion . The core of the budget proposal , hammered out for a Sept. 30 deadline , is the decision to slice $26 billion off a borrowing limit for 1984 of $83 billion . Had the debt been allowed to soar that high it would have meant a deficit equal to 21 percent of gross national product , a level that would dwarf the 3 to 4 percent ratio prevalent in most developed economies . This will mean on the one hand increased taxes expected to net at least $6 billion . The package includes an increase in taxes on both bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have violated construction regulations . Most controversial , however , are some of the provisions designed to reduce government spending by $19 billion . About $3 billion is expected to come from reduced health care benefits . And social security and pension cuts are to bring in another $3 billion . Craxi defends the package as essential to bring inflation down to 10 percent by December 1984 and to stimulate enough recovery next year to make GNP grow by 2 percent . But some say the measures presented to Parliament this month will not go far anough . Also under discussion are even more controversial proposals that include a new wage-indexation agreement , opposed by unions , that would give real teeth to an antiinflationary incomes policy and a wealth tax that has the middle classes up in arms . One positive development is that for the first time in many years the five-party coalition of Socialists , Christian Democrats , Liberals , Republicans and Social Democrats , appears firmly united behind the austerity package . In itself this is no guarantee of economic health . The real wrangling will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on wealth . But it does mean the 1984 budget is likely to be approved by the end of the year and will not be subject to traditional delays . In September the coalition pushed through Parliament a new streamlined " budget session " procedure that is expected to make final budget ratification possible before the end ofDecember.
