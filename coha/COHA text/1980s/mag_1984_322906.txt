For two months , relative calm had settled over Lebanon under a peace plan adopted by its warring factions and backed by nearby Syria . The peace fell apart last week . In the northern seaport of Tripoli , a smoldering feud between a fundamentalist Sunni Muslim group known as Tawheed and the pro-Syrian Arab Democratic Party , whose militiamen are sometimes called the Pink Panthers because of their raspberry-colored fatigues , erupted in the worst violence so far this year . Before a truce was called at week 's end , at least 100 people had been killed and more than 200 wounded , most of them civilians . That brought the total number of deaths in the Tripoli fighting since January to 400 . The Lebanese government of Prime Minister Rashid Karami , which has been unable to extend its authority to Tripoli , also saw its tenuous grip around the city of Beirut loosen somewhat . Ten people were wounded when fighting erupted once more between rival Christian and Druze militias in the hills overlooking the capital .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
