TRIAL BY FIRE Merrill Womach is n't wearing his real face . He lost it in a fiery inferno 18 years ago when the twin-engine plane he was flying crashed into a clump of trees and burst into flames . Merrill also lost the skin on his hands , legs and feet . About the only skin that was n't burned off was that on his upper torso , back and arms . Today , when you look at the face of Merrill Womach , you are looking , really , at his chest , arms and stomach grafted onto the scar tissue of what was once a very handsome face . Yet when one gazes at the reconstructed visage of Merrill Womach , and then spends time talking with this amazing man of courage and conviction , one learns some valuable lessons about what is beautiful and what is not . His wife , Virginia , said it best in the Womachs ' book , Tested By Fire ( Revell , 1976 ; $6.95 ) : " Handsome is knowing the person behind the face . Handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handsome is n't what a person looks like . It is what a person is . And Merrill is the most handsome man I know . " Most of you probably have n't seen Womach , a strong , medium-built man of 52 . But you 've probably heard his voice . And there 's a world of contrast between the rough , uneven  --  and some would say , unpleasant  --  face of Womach and his beautiful , soothing tenor voice . His voice is heard daily in nearly three-quarters of the funeral services in the United States and Canada . If you 've been to a funeral in the last two decades , chances are you 've listened to Womach singing those old favorites that seem so much a part of our deepest souls and which bring peace and hope during times of personal loss . Womach is the founder  --  and the voice  --  of National Music Service , which provides taped music systems to funeral homes . Singing for the bereaved is a vocation he has pursued since childhood . " I found way back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings to a family who has lost a loved one , " he related during a recent Los Angeles interview sandwiched between his busy schedule of meetings and speaking engagements . " I decided at that young age that , if given the opportunity to be a part of a work like this , I would do it for the rest of my life . " When I was in high school and college in Spokane , Washington , I sang at many funerals , sometimes two or three a day . After talking with some funeral directors and my young bride , Virginia , we decided it would be much better if I recorded my songs on tape for the homes . That way they could use me when they wanted and I would always sing perfectly . " The first tapes and playback units were installed in two Spokane funeral parlors in 1959 . At the time , Womach was subsisting on the meager salary of $375 a month as a minister for a small church . " But we had saved enough to buy a tape recorder for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording that makes it sound like I 'm present right there in the home . We did those first recordings in the church . The tapes were duplicated in my basement and I made the playback units myself . " And I 'm not a carpenter , " he added with a laugh . " If you could only see those things ! " . In the summer of 1959 , Merrill resigned his pastorate and began to market National Music Service in cities outside Spokane . Those first few years , while he was bootstrapping himself into business , are years he remembers with vividness . " Needless to say , during this time we had a horrible financial problem , " he said . " Looking back , I can see it was one of the many ways God used to strengthen our family , to prepare us for the trials that followed my accident . But at the time . . . whew ! " There was a period of a few months , he said , when breakfast for his family of five often consisted of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.95 and that would be our food for a few days . There were days when it was 20 below zero and , because I did n't have bus fare , I 'd walk seven miles to work . " For two years , Merrill crisscrossed the west coast , visiting funeral directors and selling the National Music Service concept . A pilot , he often flew his own plane , one of the few possessions he and his family owned . Money to keep the Womachs alive came from occasional speaking and singing engagements at churches and rallies like those conducted by Youth For Christ . His life style , obviously , was one of constant pressure , travel deadlines and lonely hotel rooms . " I was working so hard that in 1961 I collapsed five times , " he recalled . " In my own church in Spokane they had to carry me home once because I fainted dead away . I was exhausted . " By that year , though , National Music Service was beginning to take off . But it was while completing one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family at Thanksgiving  --  that Womach 's life was radically changed by the airplane accident . He recalled the accident without the slightest sense of uneasiness . " I had flown to Los Angeles , written up six orders and gone on to San Diego . Then I started flying back north . I was flying through Oregon when a snowstorm became so severe that I put down on a small emergency landing strip at Beaver Marsh . " I spent the time that night playing an organ in the home of the motel owner . He was so happy to have someone playing it that he called over the whole town  --  a few dozen people  --  and they all sang with me until midnight . " The next morning he awoke early . The weather was much better . If it stayed that way , he could make it to the family get-together in spite of having spent the night in Beaver Marsh . Completing his pre-flight check list , Womach taxied his twin-engine Piper Apache to the runway , covered with a few inches of snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . Less than a minute later , having just cleared the treetops , the engines died without warning . As he was to learn later , the snow and slush from the runway had lodged within the induction intakes of the engine and frozen . Starved of oxygen , the engine died . " I had to land immediately , " Womach remembered . " Ahead of me was forest . I did n't want to tangle with those trees . Below was Highway 97 , but I saw that if I landed there I would lock horns with a semi-truck and several cars . I had to head back toward the runway . I made the turn and went back , hoping that if I did n't make it , I could use the sparse trees ahead to cut off my wings and lessen the impact of the crash . " Fifty yards short of the landing strip , the plane stalled and hit a tree , knocking off one wing . Womach was knocked unconscious for a moment as the plane spun around backward and , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , the fuselage hit a tree . On impact the plane exploded , " he recalled . " The force of the explosion was so great that two men eating breakfast at Beaver Marsh , a mile away , said the whole restaurant shook . They knew it must be me , so they immediately drove to see if they could help . " Meanwhile , enveloped in flames , I tried to get out of the plane . All I could see was fire . I reached for the door and for my seat belt release at the same time . The belt was jammed . I tried again . In desperation , I tore it with both hands  --  a 500-pound test seat belt  --  and it broke . Man , was the adrenaline pumping through me . Freed , I jumped into the snow . " Unaware of how badly he was burned , Womach stumbled through the snow , unable to see . " My flight became a nightmare of running , tripping , falling , getting up again , " he said . " Branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my escape . " Gradually , though disoriented , he made his way toward the highway , where the two men from the restaurant found him . Putting him in the back seat , they raced toward the hospital at Klamath Falls . As he lay in the back seat , in excruciating pain , Womach said God began to take over his situation . " God took care of a need I did n't even know existed at that moment , " he said . " Many burn victims die soon after being burned because of the shock . But I never went into shock . Instead , I had this sudden urge to sing , an urge I feel God gave . I sang all the way to the hospital . It was a song called ' Wonderful Peace , ' and it 's about the peace you ca n't find on earth . I certainly could not have found any peace in my circumstances at the moment because , by the laws of nature , I should have been taking my last breath back there in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the guys driving me to the hospital were amazed . They said I sang better in the back seat than I had the night before . And I 've found that 's true . My voice is better now , after the accident . " As Womach was being rushed to the hospital , his family and relatives were assembling in Spokane , wondering why he had not already called them from the airport for a ride home . The tension had mounted . The family finally started to eat , listening on edge for the ringing of the phone . " When the doctors finished wrapping my burns , I realized I needed to call my family , " Merrill said . " I used to do some ventriloquist work and , since I could n't move my face , I talked to Virginia using my ventriloquism . The nurse held out the phone and I told Virginia that I had been in an accident but everything was fine . She did n't really know how bad things were until she arrived at the hospital a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that although she was told by the doctors that her husband would not look the same , she saw him in the distance and begged God not to let that ugly man be her husband . His blackened face , swollen to the size of a basketball , made him an ugly sight as he lay there . But Merrill had heard her come in and said , " Who 's there ? " Virginia immediately went to his side , patting him on the shoulder . A few seconds later , overcome with emotion , she excused herself and went into the waiting room , where she fainted . " Virginia was the type of person who fainted at the sight of anything unpleasant , " Merrill said . " Once , when the doctor said our youngest son had broken his collar bone , she fainted . " Virginia fainted three times that first day . The third time her heart stopped beating for several minutes and the doctors and nurses had to revive her . But then God gave her superhuman strength . During the next 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then in Spokane , she was his ever-present nurse . Several times a day she pulled scabs from his face and soaked his burned fingers in a solution that prevented them from growing together like webbed feet . Experienced nurses could not stand the sight or smell of the burned flesh on Merrill 's body , but Virginia was constantly there , providing comfort and help . What sustained Merrill and Virginia during this ordeal was a vision Merrill had one night in the hospital at Klamath Falls . Merrill said he saw a scene before him in which the colors were deep and brilliant . There was a hill , and at the bottom of the hill was a river . There was a boat on the river and a man was in the boat . On the other side of the river , Merrill says he saw a house , brilliantly lit . " Virginia , the man is Jesus , " Merrill told his wife at his bedside . " And He is motioning for me to get into the boat . " Virginia remembers stifling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can go down the hill and get into the boat with Him or I can stay here . It is so beautiful . I would like to go with Him , but I would also like to stay with you and the children . " Virginia told Merrill that she loved him and so did their children , Dan , Judie and Marlene . But the decision was his . " I knew what I would do , " Merrill related . " I would live . " Immediately the scene disappeared . Recounting that incident brought Merrill to the point of tears . " I felt I had something more to do , that God wanted me to stay on earth for a reason . I knew I was to live , and that was a real source of comfort during my recovery . " Not that Merrill did n't experience depression during the next year of numerous skin graft operations . " There were some times when not even the most comforting of Bible verses could bring me out of the dumps . But usually God would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presence . " Eventually Merrill began singing again . At first it was painful ; he had to endure not only physical pain , but the stares and gasps of insensitive people . Today , 18 years and many operations later , he still has some discomfort about his hands and face . " One eyelid does n't work too well , " he said . " Sometimes when the weather is very dry my lips draw apart and crack . But the doctors did a fantastic job reconstructing my face . It is such a difficult part of the body to work on . " The airplane accident was almost two decades ago , but it is still the pivotal point in Womach 's life . Although his business was already going , and he was known throughout the country as a church singer and speaker , he says the quality of his work changed after the crash . National Music Service is still expanding . Soon Merrill will open offices in Australia and Great Britain . He has expanded his business to include a record company . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to use . But it is in his other line of work , speaking before church groups , that Merrill notes the biggest changes . Now he has a message of hope to deliver to those in despair . When he talks with audiences , he does n't dwell on the macabre details of his accident ; instead he tells people how God works in circumstances to provide supernatural strength to endure . He relates how Godwas with him during his entire crisis , how seemingly unrelated incidents  --  when added up  --  show how God worked . " I should have died in the accident , " he said . " I should have been blinded , my lungs should have seared . And yet I can see perfectly , and many people say my voice has improved . I also know that during the years preceding the accident God worked in our family to prepare us for the year of ordeal we went through . And God continues to protect us today . " As part of the evidence to support that later statement , Merrill related that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . He was home only 14 days . He has amassed more than 2,000 hours of flying his own planes since the accident . All this without serious incident or fear . And as he talks with people today , he tells them what he feels God has taught him as a result of the accident . On faith : " Across the country , especially on television , people are being told that if they have enough faith , God will heal them of anything . If they are n't healed , they are told they must have sin in their lives . That kind of statement is keeping more people depressed and discouraged than anything I know . I asked for healing ; and others prayed over me for healing . I strongly believe God can miraculously transform my face into a baby 's skin even now . But He does n't . Yet I 'm healed . God chose not to heal me physically and that gives me an important entr  --  e when talking with others who have experienced accidents similar to mine . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked me up out of bed and put me on the road again . They feel this was God 's will operating in my life . They ask how they can know God 's will . I tell them I did n't hear some voice saying , ' Get up . ' I did know , though , that God had left me with my voice and the desire to sing . I do n't think He wanted me to sit around and wait , saying , ' What now ? ' It says in the Bible , ' I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me . ' It 's a continuing process . I use up what He gives ; He gives more . He gave me enough strength to get out of bed ; then He provided enough strength to stand before an audience ; then He gave me the strength to sing . That 's how God 's power and will works , you step out and begin doing . " On helping others in despair : " I learned some valuable lessons about ministering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even today I ca n't go to a person and say , ' Yeah , I know just how you feel , ' and try to comfort them in that way . I do n't know how they feel because I 'm not them . What I do is Continued on page 81 Trial by Fire continued from page 67 go to people and say , ' I really ca n't relate to where you are , I ca n't relate to the pain you 're experiencing , but I 'm here because I care . If there is anything I can do , please use me . ' That is much better than saying , ' Hey , smile . God is still the same . He still loves you . Cheer up ' " On suffering : " Many times there has been a need for suffering to bring out the will of God . If there was n't a need for suffering , then God would not have allowed His own Son to go through such pain . Yet Jesus suffered like no man ever . And many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , I might add , died in faith . They died believing in God and believing that God could rescue them . There was no sin in their lives . Yet they were sawed asunder , pulled apart . . . all of these things . God simply allowed this to take place because suffering is part of the Christian walk . " On the future of the world and the church : " I see some unpleasant years ahead , financially , socially and politically . It keeps getting worse . I think the church is pretty soft . Right now it 's popular to be a Christian . We even have a Christian president . But Christians are going to face some tribulation in the years ahead . And there is an awful lot of doctrine that leads a person to think that if things happen that are bad , then there must be something wrong in their relationship with God . The church must recognize that tribulation is what makes it strong . The Christian community is pretty weak today . What will happen when real trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about trouble , few people who have survived the fieryordeal that Merrill Womach has weathered . He has survived without a hint of bitterness . He does n't dwell on the pain , the stares of others , or what might have been . Instead he talks about the mercy of God , a mercy he feels allowed him to survive the accident and continue to spread hope and joy to people through his songs and his testimony . When one suggests that he must have been born with lots of moxie to begin with , Merrill wo n't deny that he has a streak of perseverance . But he quickly adds , " I would be nothing but a pile of ashes in the Oregon forest without God 's intervention . Every breath I take is given by Him . And when I quote people my favorite Bible verse , ' I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me , ' the emphasis is not on the ' I , ' but on the ' Christ . ' He is the reason I 'm alive today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
