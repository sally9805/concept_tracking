Only one week after Televangelist Pat Robertson formally declared his presidential candidacy , he received a chilling political baptism . Press accounts disclosed that Robertson 's first child had been conceived out of wedlock and that the former minister had misstated his wedding date to conceal the fact . Robertson , who has condemned sex before marriage , said he had merely tried to " protect his family " in previously suggesting that he had been married in March 1954 rather than on Aug. 27 . <P> Robertson 's first son was born ten weeks after the wedding . Robertson said that he and his wife Dede considered March 22 , 1954  --  the candidate 's birthday  --  their true marriage date " because our son was conceived that day . " " I have never , ever indicated that in the early part of my life I did n't sow some wild oats , " Robertson declared last week . " But I also said that Jesus Christ came into my life , changed my life and forgave me . " The candidate 's reaction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was indignant . " I think it is outrageous to intrude into a man 's family in the guise of journalism . " <P> Other discrepancies about Robertson 's past have also surfaced . The campaign had claimed that the candidate did graduate study at the University of London in 1950 ; in fact , he took a single summer course . Several weeks ago Robertson emphatically denied ever suggesting that only Christians and Jews were fit to govern . But TIME has obtained an audiotape of a January 1985 broadcast of the The 700 Club in which he says exactly that . Last week Robertson waffled on his earlier denial , saying that " sometimes one misspeaks and sometimes one forgets . " <P> As he fielded questions about what is gospel and what is apocrypha in the life of Robertson , the candidate professed to see a political plus . " You are proving that I am a human being , " he told reporters . Being human is one trait that a growing number of candidates from both parties have firmly established by now .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
