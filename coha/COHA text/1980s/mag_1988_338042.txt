The U.S. Supreme Court is sometimes asked to play God . Last week it turned down the chance to play doctor . In a closely watched case , the Justices declined to decide whether alcoholism is a disease . But they did rule 4 to 3 that the Veterans Administration is not required to view it as one . Two recovered alcoholics sued the VA when it refused to extend the period in which they were entitled to education benefits . Usually veterans receive such benefits only within ten years of leaving the service . The plaintiffs claimed that their drinking qualified them for a special extension offered by Congress to disabled vets provided their disability is not due to " willful misconduct . " The VA , however , deems most alcoholism to spring from just that . The Justices ruled that the VA policy is acceptable . Even among those who consider alcoholism a disease , they argued , " the consumption of alcohol is not regarded as wholly involuntary . " Though the decision is not expected to affect medical-insurance benefits or hospital treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think the decision is wrong , " said Kirk Johnson of the American Medical Association . " To say that primary alcoholism is equivalent to willful misconduct is an anachronism .
