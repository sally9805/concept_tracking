 | " We must be careful , " said John Erickson , " that perestroika does n't turn out to mean peredyshka . " Perestroikarestructuring ? is Mikhail Gorbachev 's buzzword for political and economic change in the Soviet Union . Peredyshka ? breathing space ? was Lenin 's secret foreign policy in the years he was trying to consolidate Bolshevism . Erickson , director of defense studies at Edinburgh University and one of the West 's leading historians of Soviet military affairs , knows all about Lenin 's breathing space . But like many other worried Europeans , he is trying to assess what restructuring means for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . The concern : Ultimately , it could weaken the U.S. commitment to Western Europe . The force that drives restructuring is the fear of Gorbachev and his supporters that " without it , there 's a real danger of losing what has already been achieved , of going backward . " That is the analysis of Prof. Jeffrey Gleisner , a Sovietologist at Leeds University in England . The Soviet Union has had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward edge of military technology . It is chipping into the frozen treasures of Siberia . It has created an enormous merchant marine and a Navy of global reach . It has even avoided the rust-belt effect in heavy industry . But these achievements have been bought at the price of consumer starvation . The only way the Soviet consumer can be compensated for 70 years of deprivation is by savings on defense . That is why the phonetic overlap of perestroika and peredyshka rings so ominously in the ears of European strategic experts such as Erickson . The so-called zero-zero concept regarding intermediate-range nuclear forces ( INF ) undoubtedly offers the Soviet Union breathing space . It is a powerful consideration behind the Soviet position as Secretary of State George Shultz discusses arms control with leaders in Moscow this week . Zero-zero means eliminating INF weapons from the European strategic zone . As discussed at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik , the agreement would confine the versatile Soviet SS-20 missile to east of the Ural Mountains . In return , America 's cruise missiles and Pershing 2s would leave Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Vigor , a British Defense Ministry analyst puts it , although the Soviets " might eventually be able to defend against cruise they have no hope of dealing with Pershing 2 " except by diplomatic means , or by getting deep into strategic defenses . Given the awesome costs of matching America 's Strategic Defense Initiative , particularly in the short-range dimension , the sacrifice of SS-20 seems a cheap price to pay for the economywide benefits of zero-zero . " Of course , " concedes Christopher Donnelly , director of the Soviet Studies Center at Sandhurst , Britain 's West Point , " Gorbachev wants to demonstrate domestically that he has improved the Soviet Union 's security position . " But in concrete terms , it is the financial relief offered by zero-zero that really counts for him . Zero-zero promises a stronger Soviet Union in the long run , through a more contented work force , a larger civilian economy and a slower timetable for matching the United States in intercontinental SDI . Still , zero-zero almost certainly  | means a weaker Europe . The last six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the alliance 's 38-year history has done . Academic reflection on the consequences of a weakening of the American guarantee to Europe has been a staple of editorials in British and West German newspapers for a decade . " Europe can not count on America keeping 300,000 troops on the wrong side of the Atlantic forever , " is a sentiment that sober journalists have put to their readers hundreds of times . The conventional wisdom was to agree and take no further notice ? not even when a move by Senator Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) to withdraw 100,000 Americans failed in the Senate by the narrowest of margins . Then there was Reykjavik , and an Arctic wind sent shivers through every European NATO capital . President Reagan 's willingness there to negotiate over the heads of his allies was enough alone for the chilling effect . Since then , the Americans have absorbed the European concern ; to what effect is not yet apparent . U.S. strategists differ about how to deal with short-range missiles and guard against cheating . There is speculation that Shultz , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week actually calculated to prevent agreement . Gorbachev anticipated that American tactic with a new plan ? aimed mainly at European opinion ? to negotiate away short-range missiles while INF talks continue . It may impress publics , though not governments . In what was billed as a major foreignpolicy speech in California , Reagan merely exuded optimism about the prospects for an agreement , but without new details about his own position . The net effect is that America 's allies are on guard , unable to take long-term comfort from what they are hearing . Disparity of numbers Why is Europe so frightened by the thought of U.S. withdrawals of missiles , troops , or ? worse ? both ? The simplest economic analysis demonstrates that the European Economic Community has both a larger population and a larger economy than either of the superpowers . But its wealth and manpower do not translate into equivalent military force . The Soviet Union maintains 30 divisions in East Germany , Poland , Hungary and Czechoslovakia . Britain and West Germany , the two highest-spending NATO members , field only 15 divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-range nuclear missiles there . Britain , West Germany , Belgium and Holland between them deploy no more than 127 , fewer depending on what 's counted , and the warheads are under American control . The disparities abound in every other military sector . The British and West German air forces have 700 combat aircraft in the Central Region , the Soviets 2,900 . In tanks , the figures are 9,000 for European NATO states , 19,500 for the Soviet Union ; in artillery pieces , 4,000 and 10,000 , respectively . If the French forces , which do not belong to NATO 's " integrated military structure " are included , the ratios improve slightly . But counting in the best of the Warsaw Pact forces , those of East Germany , Poland and Czechoslovakia , immediately makes the imbalance greater again . And looming within the whole equation is the factor of Soviet and Warsaw Pact reserves . " Remember , " says Christopher Donnelly , " the Russians throw nothing away . We have recently had reports of Soviet conscripts ' being trained on ancient T-34s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Soviet military warehouses are stuffed with equipment  | Western armies would have junked long ago . The personnel are available to man it . Conscription is an instrument of social control throughout the Soviet bloc that adds 1.3 million trained men to its military reserves each year . NATO can not begin to match these resources . West Germany has a reserve Army of 600,000 , by far the largest in Western Europe . But the real source of reinforcements is the United States . The REFORGER ( Reinforcement Germany ) program can put a whole division into the Central Region in 24 hours . Its symbolic effect is even greater than its material importance . REFORGER demonstrates the United States ' will as well as its capability to stand by Europe . No matter that the Soviets have 30 divisions in the Soviet Union that can be moved at short notice . It is the knowledge that the U.S. could strengthen its forces in West Germany in a crisis that has calmed European fears for the last 20 years . Thatcher 's concerns The prospect of zero-zero has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret Thatcher visited her French and West German counterparts before traveling to Moscow three weeks ago . Their counsel coincides with her outlook . All three major European leaders concede that they can live with zero-zero . But the collateral is that the Soviet Union must simultaneously reduce its shortrange nuclear systems ? SS22 and 23 , which are substantially larger than NATO 's complement of the Lance and Pershing 1 equivalent ? and also show willingness to negotiate downward its tank and tacticalaviation strength to Western European levels . If the Soviets refuse , and if they should succeed nonetheless in talking the present or the next U.S. administration into zero-zero unilaterally , the prospect is that Western Europe will abandon its subordinate military role and seek means to assure its own defense outside the American guarantee . That does not mean that Western Europe will increase its conventional forces . Spending on tanks and aircraft not only is politically unpopular in most Western European states , but it also is seen as pointless . The electorates of the NATO nations know they can match the Soviets at that level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern European counterparts ? dominated by the state and its military ? when all their post-World War II drives have been in the opposite direction . The probability , as a result , is that Britain and France ? and even West Germany , though it has renounced nuclear weapons ? will seek to make themselves a free-standing nuclear bloc by the next century . France , of course , already has the foundation with its own national force . French alternatives Britain 's " independent " nuclear deterrent is currently an American gift . But the cost of modernizing the French deterrent encourages Paris to look favorably on British offers of cooperation , and at least one British political party , the up-and-coming Social Democratic Party , has made an U.S. troops man a Pershing 2 in west Germany Anglo-French deterrent a plank of its platform . The French , on their own account , are seeking to forge a military axis with West Germany outside NATO . Its vehicle would be the moribund Western European Union . Britain could not afford to stand aside if the other two brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western European Union , with its own deterrent , would be a third force in the NATOWarsaw Pact confrontation of which both of the superpowers would have to take account . Of course , Western Europeans would prefer not to have to go that way . But what they fear from zerozero , as Christopher Donnelly puts it , is that " by small steps Russia will achieve a nuclear-free Europe . " Though a nuclear-free Europe would probably make Americans and quite certainly the Soviet leadership feel less at risk , it would make Europeans ? unilateralists and pacifists apart ? feel more threatened than they have been since the heyday of Stalinism . Zero-zero would then be seen as a triumph of peredyshka ? breathing space . Little wonder that , while the two superpowers prepare for the next summit , the European men in the middle are considering some perestroika of their own ? a restructuring of their defenses that would not leave them at the mercy of agreements negotiated between Washington and Moscow .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
