Ten years ago , two federal judges in Chicago approved what was then a record $200 million settlement in an important antitrust lawsuit brought against companies that manufacture the cartons that breakfast cereals and a host of other products come in . The settlement should have put an end to the litigation , but what has happened since is one of the stranger legal battles in the federal courts-and one that resulted last week in an unusually harsh opinion by the U.S. Court of Appeals here . The opinion , written by Appeals Court Judge Harlington Wood Jr. , nailed the U.S. attorney ' s office , Senior Judge Hubert L. Will of U.S. District Court and several of the Chicago lawyers instrumental in bringing the antitrust suit . The controversy involves about $6 million left over when all claims had been paid to victims of the alleged price-fixing conspiracy and the time for filing late claims had passed . In 1983 , Will and District Court Judge Edwin Robson , who has since died , approved a plan to use the leftover money to set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wasn ' t a proper use of the funds and ruled in 1984 that the leftover money should go to the federal government . Will and the lawyers tried again . This time , they proposed giving half the money to the firms that brought the original suit as sort of a bonus ; the other half was to go to two Chicago law schools to fund research projects involving antitrust and complex litigation . The U.S. attorney ' s office here was notified of the proposed settlement , according to the lawyers involved , and expressed no interest in opposing it . About two months later , the U.S. Justice Department learned of the plan and attempted unsuccessfully to intervene before Will . The Appeals Court saw the new proposal as an attempt to circumvent its earlier ruling . " The circumstances of this case call into question the power of this court and the enforcement of its judgments , " Wood wrote . Wood characterized the comments of one lawyer during oral arguments as imprudent and accused Will and lawyers involved in the settlement of attempting to rewrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Appeals Court removed Will from the case , ruled that the federal government no longer has any right to the leftover funds and ordered Loyola University to give back the $1. 2 million grant it had received under the second plan . The University of Chicago was to have received $156 , 000 but never got the money . Wood , with Appeals Court Judges Richard Cudahy and Michael S. Kanne concurring , said Will was headed in the right direction by giving away the leftover funds to a worthy use but disagreed with the result , pointing out the antitrust settlement resulted from " a nationwide case " and suggesting instead that a new judge might want to give the $2 million now remaining to the newly created Federal Judicial Center Foundation in Washington , D.C. Some lawyers wonder , though , exactly what legal distinction the Appeals Court finds between a foundation created by Congress and the University of Chicago , with a nationally respected law school that happens to be located in Chicago . White-collar criminal law Former federal prosecutors always have found a home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the scramble to recruit lawyers who have had experience as assistant U.S. attorneys seems to be accelerating with the increase in white-collar criminal defense work . The latest career moves to report include that of Thomas Anthony Durkin , a federal prosecutor in the days of former U.S. Atty . Dan Webb and lately in solo practice . Durkin joins 80-lawyer Arnstein &; Lehr and will head up that firm ' s white-collar crime division . Durkin represents Sam Cali , one of the futures traders indicted earlier this month in connection with the federal investigation at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . Leaving the U.S. attorney ' s office is Ted S. Helwig , who becomes a partner later this month at 270-lawyer Katten Muchin &; Zavis . Helwig has been deputy chief of the appeals division under U.S. Atty . Anton Valukas and was involved in the investigation that resulted in indictments of former employees of First Commodity Corp. of Boston . Helwig joins another former prosecutor , Sheldon T. Zenner , who is in charge of Katten Muchin &; Zavis ' white-collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case &; Brown loses its identity Sept. 1 when it merges with the larger and older Schuyler , Roche &; Zwirner . Schuyler , which handles a broad range of commercial litigation , will gain the expertise that Walsh , Case &; Brown has in savings and loan law and other areas , says Paul S. Gerding , a member of Schuyler ' s mergers committee.
