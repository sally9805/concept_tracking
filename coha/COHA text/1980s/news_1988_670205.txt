SIOUX CITY , Iowa  --  Kirk Scheelhaase hunts cattle auctions by day to build up his herd , and voters by night to build up Massachusetts Gov . Michael Dukakis . Tall and big-fisted , he is a striking contrast with the slight Northeasterner he champions in the Democratic presidential caucuses Feb. 8 . Months ago  --  before he even was aware of what was happening  --  Mr. Scheelhaase was subtly courted by the Dukakis camp . Now as the rural coordinator for two dozen precincts outside Sioux City , the 30-year-old farmer courts others . " They give you a goal , " he says , " but you try to do better . " It is a contest in organizational politics waged across Iowa today in both parties . A good organization can ' t save a bad candidate , but a mediocre one can hurt the best . By tradition and necessity , Democrats expend the most energy . But lessons learned in 1980 and the advent of politician-preacher Pat Robertson have led Republicans to invest more resources as well . " Everything is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GOP Sen. Robert Dole ' s state campaign . " I fully expect it to become a race where organization inevitably is going to be an important factor . " Buoyed by recent polls , the Dole campaign hopes to pump up voter turnout to record levels to maximize its potential victory over archrival Vice President George Bush . In the tightly bunched Democratic field , Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt seeks to save his candidacy by mounting a major drive to contact as many as 500 , 000 registered voters in the final weeks . Organization is an article of faith among political operatives , especially in the Iowa caucuses . The campaigns must persuade their supporters to leave their warm homes on a winter ' s night , farmers driving country roads in the dark , to attend 7 p. m. meetings that  --  especially in the case of the Democrats  --  may drag on well into the evening . " You ' re trying to get these people to come out for two hours at night to stand up for you , " says Rep. Gephardt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurdle is one reason that former Sen. Gary Hart may have trouble translating his lead in some Iowa polls into concrete results Feb. 8 . Four years ago , the Colorado Democrat cleverly used organization to finish second in Iowa and become an instant celebrity . Today , his late re-entry in the race and lack of a state organization help explain his insistence that the New Hampshire primary , rather than Iowa , will be the first real test of his renewed effort . The caucuses here , rich in personal politics , are also deeply ingrown . Fewer than a third of the registered Republicans and Democrats statewide will participate . Old rivalries simmer behind allegiances to different campaigns . Harry Smith , a craggy lawyer for labor ' s muscle , goes with Mr. Gephardt . John O ' Brien , whose clients include the Roman Catholic archdiocese , backs Illinois Democrat Sen. Paul Simon . Mr. O ' Brien ' s son runs the Simon county campaign , while a niece is chosen by the Gephardt forces to captain the biggest precinct in the city . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those with a proven record of attendance , in the belief that they will be the most likely to turn out again . That emphasis led both parties to greatly underestimate the turnout in 1980 , raising questions as to the ability of what were judged well-organized campaigns to identify their supporters . More broadly , critics argue that the attention paid to organization can distort the priorities of a campaign and give it too narrow a focus when a candidate would be better off broadening his message . New York Rep. Jack Kemp , who stresses his own youthfulness and desire to bring new blood into the GOP , here in Iowa has devoted more energy to appeals to the elderly on Social Security : The elderly have a better track record of showing up at caucuses . Instead , it is the 63-year-old Mr. Bush who gambles on young Republicans in a sophisticated mailing designed to bring out the 18-to-35-year-olds . " On a winter ' s night in February . . . will you be there ? " asks the holiday brochure in which Mr. Bush pledges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS . " Republicans don ' t require prior registration in the party , and voting demands little more than coming to the caucus and signing a card . By contrast , Democrats ask all participants to register and to vote in a process that requires a camp to have 15% representation to have any chance of getting delegates . That puts a greater premium on organization among the Democrats . Yet despite the extra emphasis , Democratic turnout still trails Republican . Leaders play down the impact of party rules , but the differences do mean that it ' s easier for a GOP outsider like Mr. Robertson to break into the process than it is for a Democratic outsider like Jesse Jackson . Candidates who reach out to new participants must measure the potential gains against the savings of focusing on the old . Here in Woodbury County , fewer than 2 , 000 Democrats have voted in the past two presidential caucuses , compared with 4 , 394 who voted in the 1986 primary for lesser offices . How the campaigns use the lists of previous attendees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat Bruce Babbitt , whose support is in pockets elsewhere in the state , is reluctant to invest in going beyond the caucus attendees . The strong local Simon organization will make calls to both lists , but even then he is scarcely reaching a third of the registered Democrats here . Gov . Dukakis ' s campaign " sweetens " its list by adding groups where he runs well  --  Greek-Americans most obviously . But none is so ambitious as Rep. Gephardt , whose final push depends on contacting better than 17 , 000 Democrats . In 1984 , Democrat Walter Mondale mounted a similar drive that netted only an estimated 5 , 000 new caucus-goers statewide . It made no difference to the outcome then ; for Mr. Gephardt , the same votes would be crucial in his struggle for position . Labor , which gave Mr. Mondale muscle in 1984 , remains important to Democrats in Iowa , but it is divided among the candidates and often worn down by wage cuts and strikes . The question for each GOP organization is how close the turnout comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Sioux City that year , Mr. Bush defeated Ronald Reagan with 982 votes , while Mr. Dole finished seventh with 21 . " He did so poorly eight years ago , he can be ' new , ' " says George Wittgraf , the Bush state chairman , and that energy of newness can boost a campaign . This year , aided by the organization of Sen. Charles Grassley , the Dole campaign sets targets based on a Republican turnout 30 , 000 to 50 , 000 above 1980 . Though these may be scaled back , the assumption remains that participation will still be larger than eight years ago . One reason for the higher projections is the presence of Mr. Robertson ' s campaign , which has taken as many as 30 , 000 voter registration cards for distribution to supporters . So far , though , this has translated into very modest increases in GOP registration in counties like Woodbury . Supporters of the television evangelist are intensely active in some precincts here , but he himself has appeared far less than other GOP contenders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are distributed .
