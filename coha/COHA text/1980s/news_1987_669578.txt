One major question is being asked : ' ' How long will the United States government and Congress go on blindly supporting Israel at the heavy expense of the American taxpayer when Israel ' s policies and actions sometimes ignore and damage America ' s vital interests and those of its friends and allies ? ' ' // Paradoxically , it is not primarily Americans but thoughtful and moderate Israelis who are today asking this question . They recognize Israel ' s basic dependence on the United States for a multibillion-dollar annual subsidy and for strong political support , without which Israel ' s future could be bleak . They also recognize that even without formal security ties , Israel has received far more favorable treatment and forbearance than we have shown our NATO and other allies who are much more important to our security and economic interests. // // Certainly in the past we have had disagreements with Israel , going back to the Suez crisis in 1956 when Israel invaded Egypt and withdrew only when President Eisenhower threatened to cut off aid . But while differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their national interests , there are limits that should not be exceeded if continuing cooperation is desired . In one of the two most recent cases , Israel exceeded that limit. // THE first , Israel ' s role in the arms deal with Iran , should not have surprised us , for as early as the 1960s when I was serving as ambassador to Iran , top-ranking Iranians informed me that Israel was cooperating with the Shah ' s government , supplying aid to the Iraqi Kurds who were rebelling against the Iraqi government. // The second , the Pollard spy case , was indefensible - an arrogant and insensitive act against a friendly country and people who have done more for Israel than the rest of the world has . The Israeli government ' s absurd denial that there was any high-level knowledge has further discredited it , particularly after it promoted Col. Aviem Sella , the spymaster who ran Mr. Pollard , to command of Israel ' s second most important air base. // How has our relationship with Israel reached such a point and what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Israeli government is primarily responsible . Because of Israel ' s past , it does have a ' ' siege mentality . ' ' But apparently also it has become so used to getting whatever it wants from the US Congress and government , using the powerful Israeli lobby in Washington , that it no longer feels any constraints. // Abba Eban , one of Israel ' s most respected leaders , and three Cabinet ministers called for an investigation of ' ' the entire system ' ' that made the Pollard affair possible . Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused , saying the matter ' ' is closed , ' ' but later backed down and agreed to a two-member commission. // The US Congress also bears a responsibility for Israel ' s ' ' misjudgment . ' ' Why ? Because members have often let themselves be influenced or intimidated by promises of votes and campaign contributions or threats of opposition by Washington ' s most powerful lobby - the Israeli lobby that takes direction from Israel. // Lobbies are a way of life in our political system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of many examples is the way Congress has treated the administration ' s request for authorization to sell ( not give ) AWACS aircraft and other defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia , a friendly and moderate Arab nation that sits on about 40 percent of the world ' s oil reserves and could face serious defensive problems , particularly if Iran wins the war with Iraq . When the Israeli government opposed the sale and the Israeli lobby said ' ' no , ' ' Congress would not budge . The sale of AWACS was , however , subsequently approved. // Some thoughtful members of the American Jewish community who strongly support Israel have long been concerned about the Israeli lobby ' s direct connection with the Israeli government . They recognize this is a direct intervention by a foreign government into our internal affairs that could eventually boomerang. // When I was serving as assistant secretary of state some years ago , a Jewish friend explained to me how the Israeli lobby got its direction . ' ' The Israeli Embassy knows , ' ' he said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So when Congress is deliberating on a matter of concern to Israel and it is important to get several thousand telegrams on the desks of key members of the Congress , calls are made through pay telephones to private numbers throughout the country by embassy staff to get the word out . When time permits , embassy attaches are also dispatched on tours to brief lobby leaders and go over strategy with them. ' ' // On another occasion , a congressional leader explained to me that although only about 50 percent of eligible Americans vote , the Jewish communities are extremely civic minded and almost 100 percent vote . In important urban communities with a 10 to 20 percent Jewish population , their votes count for 20 to 40 percent of the votes cast . That is a powerful incentive for some members. // Today , Israel ' s image in the US is tarnished . Even before the full impact of the Pollard affair , a survey by the Chicago Council on Foreign Affairs showed that while more than half the American public would favor sending troops if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in defending countries such as Israel and South Korea. // A free , independent , and democratic Israel is of great importance to the US in the volatile and explosive Middle East . American support for Israel , however , has been impaired by the Pollard affair and by the efforts of Israeli extremists to annex the West Bank and deny a ' ' homeland ' ' of some sort to the Palestinian people. // So what can be done to get US-Israel relations back on a durable track ? // First , there should be a reappraisal by our government of US-Israel relations . Israel should be informed of exactly where we stand on key issues affecting major US interests in the Middle East . Contrary to the Israeli lobby pitch , US and Israeli objectives are not always the same , and in some instances have not been compatible . While only Israel can decide its policies in light of its perception of its national interests , it should be made clear by the US that when Israeli policies or actions adversely affect US interests , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel are concerned. // And certainly the time is long overdue for members of our Congress to think twice when US and Israeli policies differ , before jumping on the Israeli lobby bandwagon. // //
