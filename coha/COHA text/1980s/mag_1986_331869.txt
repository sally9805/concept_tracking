She is certainly a chip off the old blocker , but while her dad is associated with a major household appliance , Norie Shanta Perry is a lot smaller than even a bread box . Last week in Evanston , Ill. , little Norie became the newest addition to the family of Sherry and William ( " the Refrigerator " ) Perry . Born eight weeks prematurely , she weighed in at a delicate 3 lbs . 10 1/2 oz. , a tiny fraction of her famous father 's 300-plus lbs . She will be the third lady in the Perry household , joining Mom and her three-year-old big sister Latavia . " Now I 'm outnumbered three to one , " quipped the Chicago Bears defensive tackle , who celebrated by pass ing around chocolate cigars . Though Mrs. Perry has already gone home , the diapered " fridgette " will have to stay in the hospital about three more weeks . Imagine a Perry who is supposed to gain weight .                @ @ @ @ @
