Talking with Afghanistan 's three top leaders <P> When TIME Diplomatic Correspondent Strobe Talbott arrived at the Presidential Palace in Kabul last week , he found President Babrak Karmal as affable in manner as he was doctrinaire in his pronouncements . At the beginning and the end of a 90-minute interview , the first Kar mal has had with an American journalist , the President and party leader kissed Talbott on both cheeks in the traditional Afghan greeting , urging him to " come back some time and hunt Marco Polo sheep in our beautiful mountains . " Karmal spoke mostly in English , which he said he learned in King Zahir 's prisons during the 1950s , and proudly recited the opening lines of the U.S. Declaration of Independence , explaining that he ad mired Americans as people with " a great revolutionary and anticolonialist tradition . " Karmal 's chef de cabinet and one of his principal military aides were more comfortable speaking Russian . <P> Karmal , 52 , is a revolutionary of un abashedly pro-Soviet leanings . In the mid- ' 60s he formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hewed closely to Moscow 's line . After the 1978 coup that brought rivals in a more in dependent party faction to power , he was sent off into diplomatic exile as Ambassador to Czechoslovakia . In December 1979 , when the Soviets invaded and killed his predecessor , Hafizullah Amin , Karmal emerged as the new leader . <P> Western observers are convinced that Karmal was in the U.S.S.R. at the time of the invasion , that he broadcast his inaugural address as President from Tashkent , and that he was flown into Afghanistan only after the Soviet occupation force was in place . " Lies and fabrications , " said Karmal , adding that he had been living secretly in Afghanistan for a few months during the previous regime , and that it was he who " requested " the So viet intervention on instructions from the Afghan party central committee . <P> Karmal insisted that the war is going well : " We have defeated the counterrevolutionary bandits even though we have not yet completely destroyed them . " Most of the fighting , he said , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviets : " The limited contingent of our Soviet friends is to be held in reserve , as a potential force to be used against the massive outside aggression in this undeclared war that is being waged against us by terrorists operating from some 80 bases in Pakistan . <P> They are armed by the American imperialists and the Chinese hegemonists , and funded by the petrodollars of Saudi Arabia . If the outside interference were to stop , we could solve all our problems in a matter of months , and the limited contingent of our Soviet friends could go back to their home in the peace-loving U.S.S.R. " <P> The U.S. and other backers of the mujahedin , Karmal claims , are not really interested in a Soviet pullout : " The forces of hegemonism and imperialism do not want the contingent to withdraw . Why ? Because for them the continued presence here of our friends is a pretext that they can exploit against the Soviet Union . "                    @
