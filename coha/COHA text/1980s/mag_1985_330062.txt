Since the beginning of airline deregulation in 1978 , U.S. airlines have engaged in several costly and sometimes disastrous battles over fares . Last week the skirmishing resumed as American Airlines slashed prices on more than 2,400 routes by as much as 70% . Within 24 hours , American 's new Ultimate Super Savers prices were matched by United , TWA , Delta , Pan Am , Western , Northwest and Republic . <P> American 's new fares take effect Feb. 18 . The one-way fare from New York to Chicago , for example , will drop to $69 , compared with the full rate of $268 . New York-to-Los Angeles flights , which are $469 at coach fare , went down to $129 . Among the restrictions : a 30-day advance purchase requirement and a 25% penalty if tickets are not used . <P> Such restrictions failed to discourage potential passengers . Reservations lines were jammed last week as consumers rushed to book trips . To cope with the crush , American ticket agents were put on a six-day work week , part-timers were asked to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which expects to sell some 5 million seats at the new fares over the next three months , hopes to hit discounters like People Express hard by pampering passengers at comparable prices . <P> To Wall Street , American 's move looked like an attempt to get out in front of the competition by jumping off a cliff . Many airlines are already losing money , and discount fares may mean bigger losses . Stock prices of all the large airlines that joined in last week 's fare war fell sharply . American went down 2 7/8 points to 34 1/4 , while United dropped from 47 5/8 to 43 7/8 . Even shares of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas , the two major civilian aircraft manufacturers , were hurt , since the fare war may cut demand for planes by driving some carriers out of business .
