December 1983 : In a few days it will be Christmas . I have been snowed in for several days here in my cabin in the Ozarks , but that is of no account . Along toward the end of the month , I always go into town and stock up on extra feed for the chickens , dogs , cats , as well as supplies for myself . There 's usually a week or more during January when the mile and a half of lane out to the mailbox is impassable to a truck . The weather came a bit early this year , but I was prepared . // The lane is a county road , and after the school bus routes have been cleared , the man who drives the township grader may clear my way . But the machine is undependable and held together with baling wire and Ozark ingenuity , so it may not get here before the snow melts . // A few years ago after another heavy snow , he did clear the lane . It was bitterly cold , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the driveway and invited him in for coffee . He accepted , drove the grader up to my cabin , and turned it off . The second he did so , a look of distress swept his face . He had forgotten that his battery was n't holding a charge , and now that the engine was off , he 'd never get it started . I happened to have a battery charger , so while the coffee percolated , he hitched the grader to the charger . We sat by the wood stove , talking of roads and weather , and by the time we 'd emptied the coffeepot , he was able to start the engine . Country living requires cooperation . // Fifteen years ago I was working in a city , living in the suburbs and had an hour 's drive to work each day . I grew to loathe winter , dreading the drive on slippery , congested highways . Winter was an enemy I had to fight ; but now I am a commercial honey producer and plan my sales trips so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I repair equipment , label honey jars , prepare for the spring bee season and putter around in the barn or cabin . Winter is no longer an enemy . It has become a time of quiet and peace . // The mailman has not been able to get through on the back roads for a few days , but he 's going to try to make it today , so I 'll walk down to the mailbox later . It 's a journey that I enjoy at any time of the year . The dogs like it , too , and in more benign weather they rush on ahead joyfully . When the drifts are hip high , as they are today where the lane skirts the cliffs of the Jack 's Fork River , which runs 250 feet below , I try to urge the dogs to break a path , but they look at me wisely and pretend that they are too loyal and obedient to do anything but walk at my heels . Pantywaist dogs , I scold . That makes them wag their tails happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? // My son phoned last week from Boston and asked what I was going to do for Christmas . Not much , I admitted ; what was he going to do ? Well , he certainly hoped to have a tree and said I should too . I protested against cutting a tree and bringing it into the cabin and covering it with little shiny things . He agreed , but suggested decorating one outdoors . So I declared the pine outside the three big windows in the living room to be my Christmas tree and hung suet on it as a gift to the blue jays , the nuthatches and the red-bellied woodpeckers . The woodpeckers already have found it . // The feeder with birdseed on it goes across those three big windows , and the usual winter birds are feeding there  --  juncos , cardinals , titmice , tree sparrows and finches , both purple and gold . The red-bellied woodpeckers like it , too , and when they come so close , I can see the faint reddish tinge on their bellies . This morning I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't come to the feeder because they are not seed eaters , but they congregate where there are other birds , and they feed on the sumac and dogwood berries that they find at the edge of the field . // Inside , the dogs and cats are luxuriating in the warmth of the wood stove . The public radio station outdoes itself in programming during Christmas week . Last night I heard Bach 's B Minor Mass . It feels snug and cheerful and peaceful here . // I was supposed to go to a meeting today of a group concerned about a proposal to develop the Jack 's Fork River for recreational purposes  --  an environmental , economic and personal disaster . But the meeting has been called off . Winter on the banks of the Jack 's Fork has canceled it and mocks the making of plans . It 's not a proper time of year for social activism anyway , but a time for privacy and indwelling , a time for gifts and gratitude for good things that are here now . // I see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suet I 've hung there for him and the other birds , and he has seen the red-bellied woodpeckers feeding on it . It wo n't be long until his curiosity and need to eat overcome his caution . I 'm glad I 'll be here to see that . Witnessing it will be a Christmas gift in return . // Afterward I 'll go out and split firewood enough for a couple of days and stack it beside the wood stove . Then I 'll break up bits of a dead branch on the white oak that grows by the driveway for kindling tomorrow morning 's fire . That 's about as far ahead as I think it wise to plan , any farther would be hubris .
