All writers are vain , selfish , and lazy , and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery . Writing a book is a horrible , exhausting struggle , like a long bout of some painful illness . One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand . For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention . And yet it is also true that one can write nothing readable unless one constantly struggles to efface one 's own personality . Good prose is like a windowpane . <P> From Why I Write , 1947 <P> Left-wing literary criticism has not been wrong in insisting on the importance of subject-matter . It may not even have been wrong , considering the age we live in , in demanding that literature shall be first and foremost propaganda . Where it has been wrong is in making what are ostensibly literary judgements for political ends . To take a crude example , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better writer than Stalin-as he is , of course ? To say " X is a gifted writer , but he is a political enemy and I shall do my best to silence him " is harmless enough . Even if you end by silencing him with a tommy-gun you are not really sinning against the intellect . The deadly sin is to say " X is a political enemy : therefore he is a bad writer . " <P> From Literature and the Left , 1943 <P> Is it wicked to take a pleasure in spring , and other seasonal changes ? To put it more precisely , is it politically reprehensible , while we are all groaning under the shackles of the capitalist system , to point out that life is frequently more worth living because of a blackbird 's song , a yellow elm tree in October , or some other natural phenomenon which does not cost money and does not have what the editors of the left-wing newspapers call a class angle ? <P> From " I Write as I Please , " 1946 <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset , but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers ; tin pacifists somehow wo n't do . Hitler , because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength , knows that human beings do n't only want comfort , safety , short working-hours , hygiene , birth-control and , in general , common sense ; they also , at least intermittently , want struggle and self-sacrifice , not to mention drums , flags , and loyalty-parades . <P> From a review of Mein Kampf , 1940 <P> Most of us still have a lingering belief that every choice , even every political choice , is between good and evil , and that if a thing is necessary it is also right . We should , I think , get rid of this belief , which belongs to the nursery . In politics one can never do more than decide which of two evils is the lesser , and there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like a devil or a lunatic . <P> From Writers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
