Our articles are a bit like letters to the world , and sometimes the world writes back . A year ago , TIME published excerpts from the best-selling book Life and Death in Shanghai , the gripping account of Author Nien Cheng 's ordeal during the Chinese Cultural Revolution . When Cheng , who now lives in Washington , opened her mailbox a few weeks ago , she found a package of some 50 letters from sixth-graders in Alberta , Canada , who were deeply moved by her story . They wrote after Teacher Loretta Hofmann used TIME 's excerpts last semester in a history course on China at Airdrie Elementary School near Calgary . <P> On learning about the ransacking of Cheng 's home , her confinement to a tiny cell for 6 1/2 years and the murder of her daughter , Blake Hardy wrote , " I think that was horrible what they did to you , and for no reason at all ! I feel that you are a very brave and courageous lady . " Warren Driessen was blunt : " Sometimes I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The children were struck by Cheng 's assertion " I would rather die than tell a lie " and her refusal to confess to trumped-up charges . <P> The students wondered how she withstood such treatment . " I do n't know why you just did n't confess and get out of there , " wrote Damian Banick . " But I admire your courage . " Declared Nickie Borley : " I would have died if they put me through that kind of pain . " Said Jacquie Hollingsworth : " I 'm not sure that I would have stood up for what I believed in , like you did , but then again , I 'm not half as brave as you are . " Nearly all had questions : " Do you have nightmares ? " " Do you still have scars from the handcuffs and the kicking ? " " Did you ever get a proper apology ? " <P> Cheng , 73 , plans to tell Mrs. Hofmann 's class that " self-discipline is everything for one 's character . " Finding time to answer all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has received  --  may take some doing . And more may be on the way . Soon after the packet arrived from Canada , Cheng received a telephone call from Joan Audrish , a teacher in Factoryville , Pa. ; she plans to use the TIME excerpts to teach her ninth- and tenth-graders about the Cultural Revolution . As for Cheng , she is doing some studying herself , boning up on U.S. history in preparation for becoming an American citizen . Says she : " I have n't been so happy since 1966 , " the year her old life was shattered by the Cultural Revolution .
