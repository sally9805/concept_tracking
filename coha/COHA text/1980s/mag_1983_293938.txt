THE KINGDOM BY THE SEA by Paul Theroux <P> Houghton Mifflin ; 353 pages ; $16.95 <P> Modestly ironic accounts of crocodiles evaded , sheep's-ear soup survived , and thieving camel drivers overcome are what a proper travel book requires . The author labors at gaudy landscapes because they make good backdrops for sketches of himself in jaunty poses ; the reader tolerates this hamminess because tales of bandits and dysentery make him feel snug in his armchair . Writing such stuff is an honest dodge , and in recent years no one has dodged more expertly than Paul Theroux in The Great Railway Bazaar ( Europe and Asia ) and The Old Patagonian Express ( North and South America ) . <P> An unspoken compact between author and reader , however , assumes that the author should more or less enjoy his journeying . Not everything about it , not the fleas and the sandstorms . In general , though , a good travel writer should like what he sees and , in the manner of a Labrador retriever who wanders , admire each new vista slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What 's the point ? <P> Theroux violates the unspoken rule in his third travel book , subtitled A Journey Around Great Britain . Here he loathes almost everything he sees and despises each new horror more than the one before . Since there is no reason to believe that he is wholly wrong in his judgments , he convinces the reader that to visit this wretched shore would be an act of lunacy . <P> Theroux had lived for eleven years in London , he writes ( " I had come to dislike the city " ) , but knew little about the rest of England . He decided to travel around its coast and those of Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales , going mainly by foot and rail , as is his custom , and avoiding cathedrals and castles on principle . The prem ise sounds delightful ; the practice was catastrophic . Man was so vile that few prospects pleased . The author found defeated respectability at best , tackiness and decay as a matter of course , buildings meanly and cheaply made , people ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> " Walking south from Littlestone was drearier in sunshine than it would have been in fog or rain , because the bright light exposed every woeful bungalow ... " " Most villages and towns wore a pout of rejection . " " None of this made the town of Portsmouth visibly interesting , because nothing could . " " I saw that Dawlish was small and dull . " " Every house was identical , and equally ugly . " " I saw British people lying stiffly on the beach like dead in sects . " " I came to hate Aberdeen more than any other place I saw . " " Up close , Deny was frightful . " " I decided that I had seen few places on earth more depressing than Strobane in the rain . " " If I had only one word to describe the expression of Eng land 's face I would have said : insulted . "
