SHORTAGES COME and go , but one commodity never seems in short supply : investment advice . Pension funds are finding this is especially true as they return to buying real estate after a two-year lull . As always , the trick is deciding whose advice to take . That ' s the problem facing many pension-fund managers as they confront a host of advisers offering to invest in real estate on their behalf . From maybe six pension fund advisory firms specializing in real estate a decade ago , the ranks have swollen to possibly 150 . Until Prudential Insurance Co. of America first pooled pension-fund money in 1970 to buy a variety of properties , real estate was either an impractical or forbidden investment for most pension funds . Peter Aldrich , Eastman &; Waltch Inc. , a Boston pension adviser , says of Prudential ' s pioneering : t was a simple , straightforward beginning . A dreadnought like the Prudential behind it was needed . " What really piqued pension funds ' interest in real estate was the 1977-78 economic environment : a dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . Today pension funds are believed to have invested $18. 6 billion in real estate . Greenwich Research Associates , a Connecticut consultant , estimates that could grow to $40 billion within three years . THIS INFLUX OF MONEY hasn ' t gone unnoticed . Wall Street firms , banks , syndicators and some defectors from insurance companies have formed their own management firms to handle real estate investments for pension funds . As a rule , the firms are paid between 1% and 1. 25% of the net asset value of the funds each year . But it hasn ' t been uninterrupted good times for the advisers . Just as many of them were getting started in 1981 and 1982 , the real estate market slackened . Jittery investors retrenched on their real estate holdings , and even Prudential for a time was unable to handle the withdrawal of pension investments in its care with cash on hand . That left many of these firms with plenty of advice but no one to listen . Some Wall Street firms , banks and syndicators have been disappointed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension funds . And Thomas Gochberg , president of Smith Barney Real Estate , says it took his firm three years to come up with its first $20 million . But after seven years , Smith Barney now manages $300 million in real estate , a tripling in just the last year . Others report new interest as well . Prudential says contributions to its largest real estate account rose by $865 million during the last six months of 1983 , compared with only a $50 million gain from October 1982 through March 1983 . THOUGH THEY STILL dominate the field , insurance companies are plainly worried by their new rivals and the defections of some of their top people to these firms . Indeed , as Claude Ballard , who left Prudential for Goldman , Sachs &; Co. , says , " There ' s been an acceleration of musical chairs . " Compensation for top people is often well into six figures , according to those in the industry , and often includes stock , bonuses and fractional ownership of properties they buy . To counter this , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can pay better and act quicker . New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. two years ago established Copley Real Estate Advisors , which manages $3 billion in real estate . Equitable Life Assurance Society and Prudential are pondering similar moves . Joseph O ' Connor , president of Copley , says the subsidiary status enables him to buy or sell properties as quickly as any competitor . Competitors argue that the insurance companies still have a staid , cautious attitude that isn ' t suited for real estate . Mr. Gochberg of Smith Barney adds , " We ' re the only one to buy a property out of foreclosure ( for a pension fund ) . That ' s turned out to be one of the best deals we made . " With time , pension funds ' sophistication has grown too . William Ramseyer of Pension Realty Advisors Inc. , a San Francisco consultant , says pension funds are moving from " first generation " investments , such as a piece of a large fund owning diverse properties , to direct investment in a few properties . THOSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s the question of valuing a pension fund ' s stake when the time comes to withdraw . With direct ownership there ' s more risk but fewer questions about valuations . To appeal to pension funds , advisers are carving out niches for themselves based on the kinds of returns a particular pension fund will need to pay future retirees ' benefits . Mr. Ramseyer says the annual rates of return after adjustments for inflation can range from 3% on the most conservative types ( buying a building and then leasing it back to the seller ) to 10% on more risky investments . Some pension funds are selecting several real estate investment advisers instead of just one and having them propose properties for acquisition . The theory is that the competition will enable the pension fund to get the best deals available . Other pension funds , such as General Electric Co. ' s and Ohio ' s state fund , have developed their own capability to buy real estate . How these different approaches and advisers work out remains to be seen . " The proof is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that ' s several years off . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
