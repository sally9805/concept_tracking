After two days of brutally frank talks , a Soviet concession . " In a difficult world situation , we had I difficult talks . " So said West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt last week , summarizing a mission that had been fraught with perils . Washington had done little to hide its misgivings about the first visit by a Western leader to the Soviet capital since the invasion of Afghanistan six months ago . Like some of Bonn 's allies , the U.S. was apprehensive that Schmidt might undermine Western solidarity by appearing as an appeaser , eager for detente for Europe at any price . Schmidt 's political foes at home , mindful of national elections in October , had predicted that the Chancellor would return empty-handed and compromised . <P> The Kremlin 's evident jubilation over his trip was scarcely reassuring . He had asked that the meeting be treated as a " working visit , " with a minimum of pomp . When a tense but determined Schmidt stepped down from his white and blue Luftwaffe jet at Moscow 's Vnukovo II Airport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrei Gromyko were on hand , along with a goose-stepping honor guard . Belying rumors about his ill health , Brezhnev strolled briskly across the Tarmac to greet Schmidt . The ceremony was clearly intended to convey the Kremlin 's satisfaction that the Soviets were no longer considered in moral quarantine by the West . <P> Neither Schmidt nor his nervous allies had cause to worry about the summit 's outcome . After two days of intense and often brutally frank discussion with Brezhnev and his top aides , the Chancellor returned home with his reputation as a statesman intact , and with a promise of progress on arms-reduction talks . The Soviets , reported Schmidt , had abandoned two key preconditions for entering into negotiations with the U.S. on limiting the deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe . " This is not a breakthrough , " Schmidt told the Bundestag on his return , but " it opens a chance of preventing an unfettered arms race in this field . " <P> <P> In effect , Moscow had backed away from the inflexible position that it had adopted last December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new medium-range nuclear strike force in Western Europe by 1983 . The NATO force would consist of 572 Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles capable of striking Soviet territory . That force was aimed at countering the expanding Soviet arsenal of comparable weapons that already face Western Europe , which include 50 Backfire bombers and 200 medium-range SS-20 missiles . The Kremlin refused all offers to bargain with the Western allies on mutual reduction of intermediate-range systems unless NATO rescinded its deployment decision .
