BANKRUPTCY As USUAL LAST September Frank Lorenzo , the chairman of Continental Airlines , faced what could have been one of those case studies for which his alma mater , Harvard Business School , is famous : a money-losing carrier was sinking fast in a business dependent on expensive equipment , plagued by high labor costs , and rocked by ferocious competition from some fourteen nonunion , cut-rate airlines that have sprung up since the industry was deregulated in 1978 . To keep the company solvent , he needed to pare labor costs , reduce scheduled flights , ground unneeded airplanes , and cut fares . Lorenzo 's solution was unorthodox by classroom standards and suspect by courtroom ones . He filed for bankruptcy using one federal law ( Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code ) to avoid complying with another ( the National Labor Relations Act and its companion law the National Railways Labor Act ) . He may get away with it . Lorenzo was running a regional airline , Texas International , when he launched nonunion New York Air in 1980 to compete with Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time accused him of using Texas Internal assets to start a nonunion operation . Not surprisingly , the unions viewed this as threatening . Ill feeling turned to vehement distrust the next year when Lorenzo made a bid for Continental . Continental employees , along with Al Feldman , the popular chief executive at the time , made a counter offer for the airline . Texas International pilots exhorted a meeting of Continental workers with horror stories of working life under Lorenzo . Tim Gilmartin , a spokesman for the pilots ' union in Denver , reported that Lorenzo and Texas pilots signed a contract under the good offices of a federal labor mediator and three days later Lorenzo refused to honor the agreement . ( Lorenzo , responding through spokesman Bruce Miller , said , " There was indeed an agreement reached on certain components of the master contract , but never an agreement on the entire contract . To say that we signed a contract and reneged is totally false . " The National Mediation Board refused to comment . ) The bidding war dragged on and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid collapsed , Feldman committed suicide in his office . Lorenzo won the airline . Despite employees ' evident discomfort with the new management , they were willing to cooperate with Lorenzo . Continental 's pilots gave him $100 million in concessions last year . Until the bankruptcy filing , Lorenzo was seeking another $150 million in cuts this year , which would have sliced the airline 's costs by 10 percent . Negotiations , against the backdrop of an $84 million loss in the first half of the year , appeared to be making progress . Mechanics and noncontract workers had given up the $50 million asked of them , flight attendants had offered a proposal detailing $40 million worth of give-backs as their share , and the pilots had agreed in principle to concede their $60 million share . But on the Wednesday before the filing , Stephen Wolf , Continental 's president , abruptly quit ? " for personal reasons , " according to the official explanation . It seems more likely that Wolf stepped down because Lorenzo had decided to turn Continental into a smaller , cut-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow play . Lorenzo took over the president 's spot the next day , and two days later declared bankruptcy . He cut service from seventy-seven cities to twenty-five , reduced the work force from twelve thousand five hundred to four thousand , and cut flight crews ' salaries in half . In filing for bankruptcy , Lorenzo had only one purpose : to eliminate the need to negotiate with employees . The unions are now screaming bad faith and union busting . Lorenzo claims that the pilots were dilatory in negotiations and that Continental would have soon run out of cash . The airline simply could n't have operated much longer under the old contracts , Lorenzo argues . But of course the unions agreed ; that 's why they were making concessions . Continental had the bankruptcy proceedings closed to the public when it came time to review its finances , which makes it all the more difficult to determine how long the airline had to survive . What is clear is that Lorenzo first thought Continental could be saved with $150 million in concessions and then suddenly decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely more profitable ? sort of airline . Lorenzo is not the first to use Chapter 11 to avoid negotiating with his unions . Last spring Wilson Foods , the nation 's biggest pork processor , sought bankruptcy protection despite $60 million in net assets . Wilson threw out its labor agreements and cut wages in half . Union members struck , then signed the new agreements dictated by the company . They are back at work , but challenging the company 's filing in bankruptcy court . Like Wilson , Lorenzo has taken cunning advantage of the built-in conflict between bankruptcy and collective bargaining laws . Chapter 11 sensibly provides that , when possible , creditors be put on hold to give a failing company a chance to reorganize , salvage its operations , and save jobs . This means breaking contracts , although the contracts Congress had in mind when it wrote the law were mainly debts to banks and other creditors . Labor agreements are contracts , too , but of a very solemn sort . The National Labor Relations Act declares that " the policy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstructions to the free flow of commerce .. . by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining . . . . " In other words , society has a special interest in seeing that labor and management come to terms and stick to those terms . Collective bargaining is , well , the American way . Nevertheless , the courts have held that a labor contract is still a contract , and , as part of a detailed reorganization plan , can be abrogated under Chapter 11 . They have had little success , though , in coming up with a formula for when that 's allowed . The Second Circuit first said the equities on both sides should be balanced . In another case , the court said a labor agreement can only be rejected if it is clear the company can not survive any other way . The Third Circuit watered that test down in a case now before the Supreme Court , saying that the debtor does n't need to show the contract is fatal , just burdensome . At least one court has recognized that breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reorganization . Last March , a Wisconsin bankruptcy judge threw the Tinti Construction Company out of court for bad faith because it had offered no reorganization plan aside from its desire to cut its labor costs . Lorenzo 's desire is no less urgent . But by Continental 's own admission , the airline does't need to restructure its finances . Continental 's spokesman , Bruce Miller , said , " nobody has been pressured from creditors . " Chapter 11 's principal author , Representative Don Edwards , Democrat of California , says the law was never meant to be a blunt instrument in the service of union bashing : " If that 's what Continental is doing . . . we 'll plug the loophole . " Maybe the bankruptcy judge in Houston hearing Continental 's case will make that unnecessary . A labor agreement should only be abrogated as a last resort , following a detailed financial reorganization plan and compelling evidence that without that relief the company will founder . In the abstract , Lorenzo 's moves make fine business sense . Indeed , his ruthlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 11 to autocratically reject collective bargaining is not just an abuse of the bankruptcy code . It is a cavalier dismissal of how Americans have defined a portion of their democracy .
