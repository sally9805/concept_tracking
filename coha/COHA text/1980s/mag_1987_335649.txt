Bombs exploded at the offices of the ruling Radical Civic Union Party in four Argentine cities one morning last week . No one was injured , and no one claimed responsibility , but Vice President Victor Martinez blasted both " the extreme left and the ultra-right . " Both sides , he said , had trampled on the " state of rights " that Argentines have enjoyed since 1983 , when Raul Alfonsin became the country 's first elected President after almost eight years of military dictatorship . <P> The motive for the bombings was fairly certain . A day earlier , the five- member Supreme Court had upheld a law granting immunity to about 200 military officers accused of committing human rights abuses during the " dirty war " waged by the military against suspected leftists between 1976 and 1979 . Under the law , which was signed by Alfonsin in early June , only about 50 Argentines , including former top government officials , military commanders and police chiefs , are subject to prosecution for crimes , such as murder , kidnaping and torture , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect grants amnesty to hundreds of lower-ranking officers on the ground that by following orders , they were merely observing " due obedience " to their military superiors . <P> Last week 's court action centered on a legal appeal by three former aides to General Ramon Camps , the onetime police chief of Buenos Aires province . The court decision led to the immediate release of the three officers , along with scores of others who were being held on human rights charges . Camps , who was convicted last December , was not affected by the ruling , and will continue serving a 25-year sentence . Among the five former junta leaders already convicted are ex-President Jorge Rafael Videla and a onetime navy chief , Admiral Emilio Massera , both of whom are serving life terms . <P> The due-obedience law has been widely criticized , particularly by relatives of the 9,000 or more people who disappeared during the dirty war and are presumed dead . Declared Hebe de Bonafini , president of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo , an organization of parents whose sons and daughters disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think the government is with the people . It 's like a dictatorship . Everything is fixed . " Even Federal Prosecutor Julio Cesar Strassera , who led the government case against junta leaders two years ago , was quoted by a Spanish newspaper as calling the law an " error " and an " absurdity , " adding that " society knows perfectly well what happened during those years . " In Buenos Aires , a newspaper cartoon carried the caustic caption " To err is human , to forgive is divine , to approve due obedience is Argentine . "
