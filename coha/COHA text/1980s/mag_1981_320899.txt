Hunger strikers lose favor <P> When he formed his government earlier this month , Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald was bitterly critical of the British government . Reason : Whitehall 's unyielding approach to the members of the Irish Republican Army who were conducting hunger strikes in the Maze Prison near Belfast . But last week FitzGerald declared he was much more sympathetic to Whitehall 's tactics . That turnabout led the London Times to editorialize : " There has been a remarkable improvement in relations between the British and the Irish governments over the past few days . " <P> One reason for the change was Ireland 's indignation about the riots that had exploded in Dublin the previous Saturday when 15,000 demonstrators , organized by I.R.A . supporters , marched on the British Embassy . Some 500 of the protesters engaged in pitched battles with the police . In the melee , the fiercest confrontation in the republic since the 1920s , about 200 civilians and policemen were injured , and the damage to property amounted to more than $2 million . <P> What was more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuttling two overtures toward a possible settlement . First , they dismissed a three-man International Red Cross delegation as " pawns of the British . " Then they refused a British offer to " clarify " Whitehall 's position on possible steps to ameliorate their treatment unless the I.R.A . ' s prison representative could attend the talks . The British could not accept this condition , since it might be seen as recognition of the I.R.A . command structure . <P> There was also opposition last week to a march by some 3,000 supporters of the hunger strikers from Newry to Dublin , 70 miles away . Reported Justice Minister James Mitchell : " We have received thousands of calls and messages and letters about Saturday 's proposed march , and 98% of them have called upon us to ban it . " Nonetheless , the Irish government decided to let the march go on , while ordering in troops to guard against any possible violence . As it happened , there was none . <P> Meanwhile , two more young prisoners were at the point of death in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynch , 24 , who had been convicted of weapons offenses , had both gone more than 60 days without food . Doherty was elected last month to the Irish Parliament , whose membership is open to all Irishmen , north and south . If Doherty and Lynch die , two other I.R.A . prisoners stand ready to join the hunger strikers . <P> But for the time being at least , the British government saw less reason than ever last week to give in to the protests .
