The 600 or so guests who gathered last week on the roof of the garage at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles were treated to a strange sight . As a chorus line of cheerleaders kicked and a bevy of multicolored balloons rose in the sky , a huge cloth dropped to reveal a two-story model of a camera . Polaroid was pulling out all the f-stops to introduce the Spectra , a new instant camera that will sell for a steep $150 to $200 . <P> Polaroid hopes that the Spectra will revive its instant-camera sales , which plunged from a record 9.4 million units in 1978 to 3.5 million last year as more and more shutterbugs turned to superior 35-mm cameras .
