The infamous CIA manual on guerrilla warfare might have been written with the jungles of Nicaragua in mind , but its chief effect so far has been to provoke conflict in Washington . Last week skirmishes were raging not only between the Reagan Administration and Capitol Hill but within the CIA . Five middle-level agency officials , targeted to be disciplined for their part in drafting the contentious primer , said they were being used as scapegoats . Congressional critics charged that the five were victims of a cover-up designed to protect senior officials , notably CIA Director William J. Casey , who has supervised the covert assistance to anti-Sandinista contras . <P> The latest flap began when President Reagan received the disciplinary recommendation from the CIA 's inspector general . Reagan had ordered the internal investigation amid a continuing clamor over sections of the manual that advocated the " neutralization " of local Nicaraguan officials . Critics seized upon that term as a code word for assassination . Furthermore , they charged , the manual shows that the CIA is violating a 1982 congressional amendment barring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reagan responded with the credulity-straining explanation that the word neutralization meant nothing more than " you just say to the fellow that 's sitting there in the office , ' You 're not in the office any more . ' " <P> The White House blamed the manual on a single , " lowlevel " contract operative , identified pseudonymously as John Kirkpatrick . The still secret inspector general 's report apparently suggested that Kirkpatrick resign , two employees be suspended without pay and three others receive formal letters of reprimand . New York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan compared the disciplinary measures with canceling " weekend privileges for a month . " <P> Both the Senate and the House Intelligence Committees are expected . to reopen their investigation of the guerrilla manual in early December . Some legislators even want to see the matter referred to the Justice Department . Says Democratic Congressman Norman Mineta of California : " The CIA and the President owe us some answers , and the inspector general 's report fails to give them . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
