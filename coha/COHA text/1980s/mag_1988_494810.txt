IT COULD HAVE been a lot worse , say Democrats . Michael Dukakis got 112 electoral votes . That 's a 750 percent improvement over Walter Mondale ! Duka ? kis 's 46 percent of the popular vote is the highest losing percentage the Democrats have gotten since 1964 . Not only that , but the Democrats gained Senate seats , House seats , state legislative seats , and a governorship . That is a rare achievement for a losing party in a presidential race . " Coattails ? " observed Representative Patricia Schroeder . " Bush got elected in a bikini . " On the other hand , think of it this way : the Democrats lost to George Bush and Dan Quayle . Last year a Democrat ? ic senator quipped , " If we ca n't beat George Bush , we 'd better find another country . " Well , they did n't beat George Bush . But there 's an election in Canada later this month . How 's this for an irony ? Democrats used to wear but ? tons saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap turned out to be slightly wider this year than it was in 1980 and 1984 . In the last two elections , however , it William Schneider is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute . did n't make any difference . Both men and women voted for Ronald Reagan . This year it made a difference . Ac ? cording to the exit polls , women were either evenly split or gave a slight edge to Dukakis . Men voted for Bush by a wide margin . In other words , men elected Bush . The gender gap got the Democrats . Here are three explanations for what happened to the Democrats this year : ( a ) Dukakis lost because he ran a lousy campaign . Implication : If Dukakis had run a better campaign , or if the party had put up a better candidate , the Democrats would have won . Not to worry . ( b ) Dukakis lost because of peace and prosperity . Implication : The Demo ? crats lose because they always seem to run at the wrong time ( like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get really bad under the Bush administration . Not to worry . ( c ) Dukakis lost because the country does n't want to buy what the Democrats have to sell . You just ca n't market liberalism these days . Implication : The Democrats ca n't win for the foreseeable future . Start worrying . The correct answer is all three . The Dukakis campaign really did n't have anything to sell the voters . So it was forced to sell off Dukakis as a liberal . He was the first remaindered candidate in the history of American politics . The Republicans knew from the outset that if the elec ? tion were a referendum on Bush , they would lose . Bush just had too many negatives : the wimp image , his upper-class origins , his repeated lapses of judgment ( Marcos , Noriega , Iran-contra , Quayle ) , and the normal desire for change after eight years . So the Republicans turned the election into a referendum on Dukakis . The central issue in the campaign became Dukakis 's values instead of Bush 's judgment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time denying it . He is a Massachusetts liberal . It just was n't anything he planned on talking about during the campaign . The fact is , Michael Dukakis never had to defend his values before this year . Liberal values are not controversial in the Democratic Party . And they are no big deal in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , where the Republican Party is a joke . Suddenly last summer , Dukakis came face to face with real Republicans . And like Sebastian Venable , he got eaten alive . Bush used the Pledge of Allegiance and the " tank com ? mercial " to convey the idea that Dukakis was weak on defense ( with , perhaps , the subliminal message that a son of Greek immigrants was not a real American ) . Bush used the ACLU issue and the furlough ad to portray Dukakis as soft on crime ( with , perhaps , a subliminal appeal to white racism ) . Dukakis 's chosen theme of competence got sunk in Boston Harbor . How did Dukakis respond ? By doing nothing . Which confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wimp . He 's the wimp . " Dukakis thought he could win the presidency the same way he won the Democratic nomination ? by being the " remainderman . " During the primaries , he watched the other candidates either self-destruct ( Hart , Biden ) or de ? stroy one another ( Gephardt , Gore , Jackson ) . Dukakis just picked up the pieces and walked away with the nomina ? tion . He thought he could summer in the Berkshires and wait for George Bush to destroy himself . In March , a week after Super Tuesday , when Dukakis won Florida and Texas , he came in an embarrassing third in Illinois . The next week Jesse Jackson beat him in Michigan . Everyone started screaming advice at Dukakis , but the governor refused to panic . He knew that if he stayed cool , he was n't going to lose to Jesse Jackson . That 's exactly how Dukakis responded when the same thing happened to him in August . After Bush went negative on Dukakis , Demo ? crats started pressuring him to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it all before . No one would believe those preposterous commercials anyway . " We used to read this stuff and laugh and say , ' How can this be ? Why would people take this seriously ? ' " his chief secre ? tary recalled to the New York Times . If Dukakis refused to take Bush seriously enough , Bush took Dukakis far too seriously . His anti-Dukakis commer ? cials had an ominous , threatening quality . Bush depicted the governor of Massachusetts as a menace to the republic . Over Jaws-like theme music , the ads closed with the line , " America ca n't afford that risk . " It worked . Dukakis 's unfavorable ratings doubled from 25 percent in July to 50 percent in October , according to the NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll . The view that Dukakis would do a better job than Bush of maintaining a strong national de ? fense dropped by ten points . In July , Dukakis beat Bush , 40 percent to 24 percent , as the candidate who would be tougher on crime . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 27 percent . In June , 30 percent of the public la ? beled Dukakis a liberal . In October , the figure reached 51 percent . Dukakis 's great weakness was his total inability to sus ? tain a theme . He started out with competence , until his campaign proved otherwise . Then he told people that the 17 million added jobs under Reagan were not " good jobs at good wages . " How many people like to be told that their jobs stink ? He ran television commercials talking about the nation 's " sham prosperity . " But to most people , sham prosperity is a lot better than what they had under Jimmy Carter . Dukakis spent a week or so on the " middle-class squeeze , " during which he came up with approximately one new program a day . In the second debate with Bush , he hit upon the worst theme of all . " Tough choices will be required , " he told the nation , " choices I am prepared to make and Mr. Bush is not prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think we can keep this long expansion going . " The American people were asked to choose between a candidate whose theme was " We 're all right , Jack , " and a candidate who said , " Eat your broccoli . " Finally , Mr. Competence became Mr. " On-Your-Side . " We got a dash of Gephardt nationalism and some warmed-over Mondale populism . The Dukakis campaign could never decide what it wanted to sell . So the Republicans took over the marketing . " Even though Dukakis avoided the interest group endorsements , " a GOP strategist told the Los Angeles Times , " we were able to define him as a liberal because he did not have any overall theme or identi ? ty of his own . " WHY HAS liberalism become such a scare word ? The reason is that Reagan has changed the shape of American politics . He has created a powerful political co alition that brings together a variety of interests united by one thing ? a distaste for big government . The key constituency in the Reagan coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , these voters thought of themselves as beneficiaries of government ser vices . Now they think of themselves as taxpayers . Three things happened to change their view of government . In the 1960s the War on Poverty ended up in controversy and failure . As a result , social welfare programs began to lose their middle-class constituency . In the 1970s the inflation crisis gave rise to a tax revolt . The wrath of the middle class was aimed at big government , which was seen as poisoning the nation 's economy . And in the 1980s Reagan 's anti-government program produced , or at least coincided with , a six-year economic recovery . Look at how Dukakis and Bush approached middle-class voters . When Dukakis talked about " the middle-class squeeze , " he was dealing with middle-class voters the same way Democrats have always dealt with constituen ? cies : " You 've got a problem . We 've got a program . " He had a program to help with college tuition expenses , a program to meet child-care needs , a program to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to encourage affordable home mortgages . These programs were all inge ? niously designed to be " self-financing . " Middle-class vot ? ers tend to be suspicious of government programs . They are afraid that the programs are going to end up costing them money and helping other people . Bush addressed middle-class voters quite differently . He said , " You 're in a financial squeeze ? Here 's what we 're going to do for you . We 're going to keep the recovery going . " The solution middle-class voters want is n't programs . It 's prosperity . And that is exactly Bush 's mandate ? to keep the recovery going . If he does that , he will be a fine president . If he does n't , he will be in deep doo-doo . The Reagan coalition also includes business interests that favor a deregulated business environment . It includes religious conservatives who oppose judicial activism . It includes neoconservatives who want a more aggressive foreign policy . And it includes white voters motivated by racial fear and resentment . The two constituencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 25 years are Southern whites and Northern urban ethnics ( formerly called the Archie Bunker vote , now the Morton Downey Jr . vote ) . These voters see the federal government as the protector of black interests and the promoter of the civil rights agenda . FDR brought together a coalition of interests who wanted something from government . The Reagan coali ? tion is its mirror image ? groups that want less from gov ? ernment . To the amazement of many observers , the coali ? tion held together this year for George Bush . What keeps it together is the perception of a common threat , namely , liberalism . Reagan voters fear that liberals will regain control of the federal government and use it , as they did in the past , to carry out an agenda that includes taxes , regulations , social reforms , and anti-military policies . Bush kept the coalition together because he succeeded in dramatizing the liberal threat . A THE very end of the campaign , Dukakis used eco ? nomic populism to rally the Democratic Party base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as badly among Democrats as George Bush did this year . In the end , Duka ? kis pulled the Democratic Party together better than either Carter in 1980 or Mondale in 1984 . Then why did n't he win ? Because the Democratic base has shrunk . You ca n't win elections any more just by holding the Democratic Party together . Exit polls show Democrats and Republicans evenly balanced among 1988 voters . In fact , Dukakis re ? claimed a majority of Reagan Democrats . But they com ? prised less than ten percent of the electorate . Former Dem ? ocrats who voted for Reagan are still around , of course . It 's just that a lot of them no longer call themselves Democrats . The class-warfare strategy worked for Harry Truman in 1948 . It almost worked for Hubert Humphrey in 1968 . But it did n't work for Michael Dukakis in 1988 . Like Nixon and Reagan before him , Bush used social populism to undercut the Democrats ' economic populism . Bush countered Du ? kakis 's claim " I 'm on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working man is going to decide on . I 've got those values on our side . " National Journal has produced a map of county-by-county results for the 1988 presidential election . Dukakis carried the black belt counties of the South . He carried the liberal belt along the Northern tier ? New England , New York , the upper Midwest , and the Pacific Coast from Seattle to San Francisco . He carried the Hispanic belt in south Texas and New Mexico . He carried Hawaii , which is an Asian archipelago . He carried a scattering of farm belt counties in Missouri , Illinois , and Iowa . And he carried Appalachia , where there are a lot of poor whites but few blacks . In presidential voting , the Democratic Party is now close to becoming a party of blacks and white liberals . In other words , the Jackson constituency and the Dukakis constitu ? ency . The two together are far from a national majority . And they do n't even get along with each other . THEN WHY do the Democrats still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidential level are rarely ideological . Challengers , who are often un ? known to the voters , find it hard to engage incumbents on the issues . Since most incumbents are Democrats , the Dem ? ocratic Party has a continuing advantage ? so long as it can keep ideology from seeping into state and local voting . There are two ways Democrats try to keep this from happening . One is to run on competence . Democrats are generally rated better at providing the kinds of benefits and services people want from government . The other is to exploit the advantages of incumbency . This means main ? taining a good , and well-publicized , record of constituency service . " We do better the closer we get to people 's gar ? bage , " one Democratic consultant told the Washington Post . Dukakis ran for president on competence ? as if he were running for governor . Only it did n't work . You ca n't ex ? clude values from a presidential election . Democrats have been engaged in " rethinking " what their party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what have they come up with ? Pragmatism . 1988 proves that pragmatism is not enough . Dukakis , of course , is the ultimate pragmatist . He repre ? sents the post-ideological generation of Democrats , those who grew up with the civil rights and anti-war movements and remain loyal to those values , but have mastered a new , technocratic style of politics . By putting Lloyd Bentsen on the ticket , Dukakis forged the ultimate pragmatic coali ? tion . Bentsen is a Tory Democrat , a remnant of the pre-ideological tradition of the Democratic Party . Like Duka ? kis , Bentsen sees the Democrats as a governing party , not as a party of activists . With Dukakis and Bentsen on the ticket , the pre-ideological and post-ideological traditions joined forces . And it made a lot of liberals nervous . Jesse Jackson , for one . Jackson went along with the tick ? et , but he never quite concealed his reservations about it . How could the Democrats win if they did n't say anything ? In agreeing to support the ticket , Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it your way . I 'll do what I can to help . " But there was another message : " This had better work . " It did n't . When a party loses over and over again , as the Democrats have now done in five out of the last six presi ? dential elections , it faces the likelihood of a fundamentalist revolt . At every Democratic convention , someone delivers the party 's revival speech . Jackson gave the speech this year , just as Edward Kennedy did in 1980 and Mario Cuomo did in 1984 . Each of them defined the party 's tradi ? tions , ideals , and values . The delegates cried and cheered . Their souls were saved . The party then compromised its traditions , ideals , and values by nominating someone else . Now Jackson is saying that the " centrists " have had their chance . They got Super Tuesday , superdelegates , Dukakis , Bentsen , a meaningless platform , and a timid campaign . Enough compromises , says the left . Next time we want a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they failed . THE MODERATE position ? pragmatism ? has col- apsed . So there is nothing between those who want to reaffirm the party 's old-time religion and those who want to turn to the right . The problem is that both positions are unrealistic . By moving to the left , the Democrats are only going to make things worse for themselves . Whenever they put up a liberal ticket , the Democrats get locked out of the South . It was n't supposed to happen this year , not with Bentsen on the ticket and Dukakis running on competence rather than ideology . But the minute Dukakis was exposed as a liberal , the lock closed . The South was lost . It was not quite as bad as in previous years , however . Forty-six per ? cent is better than 40 percent . It is equally unrealistic to argue that the Democrats should abandon liberalism . The Democratic Party is a lib ? eral party . That is not likely to change , nor should it . The country does not need two Republican parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , conserva ? tives nurtured their anti-government doctrines for 50 years until the Great Inflation of the 1970s finally brought them to ascendancy . In any case , the nominating process will not allow for much backsliding . No matter how many superdelegates there are , primary voters and caucus participants still con ? trol the outcome . And Democrats who choose to partici ? pate in those activities are strongly tilted to the left . This does not mean that the most liberal candidate will neces ? sarily win the nomination . It means that the Democratic nominee must be acceptable to liberals , just as the Re ? publican nominee must be acceptable to conservatives . Jimmy Carter , for instance , was widely distrusted by liberals . But he was legitimized by the civil rights issue . No Democrat who got all those black votes could be consid ? ered outside the tent . When Lloyd Bentsen ran for presi ? dent in 1976 , he was very far outside the tent ; he ended up with just 4,000 votes . Today there is good reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done his service for the cause . THE LESSON of 1988 is that the Democrats have to run a thematic campaign . But the theme can not be liberal ? ism . There are plenty of themes a good Democrat can run on without repudiating liberalism . Paul Kirk is right when he says , " I do n't think we need to go back and try to rediscover the soul of the Democratic Party . " The Democrats need three things to regain the White House ? the right opportu ? nity , the right campaign , and the right candidate . The right opportunity comes when there is a strong desire for change . Watergate created a powerful market for change in 1976 , for instance , as did inflation and the hos ? tage crisis in 1980 . A lot of Democrats thought the Iran-contra scandal and the stock market crash would do the same thing this year . But peace and prosperity prevailed , and the tide for change receded as the campaign went on . The right campaign means finding out what the voters want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . After eight years of Eisenhower , youth , dynamism , and vigor sold very well . In 1968 , when the country was being torn to pieces , the voters desperately wanted order . After Watergate , 1976 saw a big market for morality . And in 1980 , after Jimmy Carter , people were looking for leader ? ship . None of these themes was ideological . They were based on a shrewd assessment of the times . The right theme for 1988 might have been competence , given Rea ? gan 's failings as a manager . But it never really sold . When things are going well , who worries about competence ? The right candidate is the biggest problem of all . What the Democrats need is a tough liberal . That is not an oxy ? moron . It is what Dukakis meant when he said , " I 'm a liberal in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy . " It is also what Bush meant when he said , " No , you 're not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jimmy Carter and Wal ? ter Mondale . " What 's the difference between FDR , Truman , and Ken ? nedy on the one hand , and McGovern , Carter , and Mon-dale on the other ? To begin with , the first three are n't around anymore . Ben Wattenberg calls this the " dead lib ? eral " syndrome . Dead liberals are good . Living liberals are bad . But there is another difference . Roosevelt , Truman , and Kennedy ( as well as LBJ ) were all tough guys . They could n't be pushed around by the Russians or by the spe ? cial interests in Washington . McGovern , Carter , and Mon-dale ( and , for that matter , Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey ) had the image of weak liberals . All of them were respected for their integrity . But none was considered tough enough for the job . Tough liberals win . Weak liberals lose . What happened to Dukakis this year is that his image changed . He started out looking tough when he took on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Republi can campaign turned him into a wimp . His support dropped to 40 percent ? about the same as where McGov ? ern , Carter , and Mondale ended up . Only when he came back swinging did Dukakis begin to rise again in the polls . Ideology is a problem , but one that can easily be over ? come . Just find the right theme . That 's what Reagan did in 1980 . The polls showed that his right-wing in the snow . Reagan was elected in spite of , not because of , his ideology . He offered people something they wanted ? leadership . No Democrat is going to win the presidency these days because he is a liberal . But with the right campaign , he can win despite being a liberal . WHY DID the Democrats lose ? The party 's main fac- ions are giving you three reasons to choose from . Professional politicians , hoping to avoid intraparty war ? fare , are saying that Michael Dukakis , for all his talk of competence , proved to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one ? dirty , per ? haps , but effective . This line is being taken by , among others , the head of the Democratic state chairmen 's associ ? ation , Rick Wiener of Michigan , who says , " This election was not a rejection of the Democratic Party , but of the campaign run by Dukakis . I do not think he is out of the American mainstream , as Bush portrayed him . If Bush 's charges had been effectively answered , it would have been a different election . " On the left of the party , in Jesse Jackson territory , the explanation for defeat is that Dukakis yielded too much to " conservatives , " wrote a pablum platform instead of a ringing , liberal one , and nominated a Tory , Lloyd Bentsen , instead of Jackson , who finished second in the primaries and deserved the spot . Jackson told the Wall Street Journal that " some want us to spend our time and efforts pursuing Democrats who 've defected . But I think our future is in pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left out ? blacks , Hispanics , women . We should enlarge the franchise , not change it . " Jackson especially targeted the Democratic Leadership Council , which has emerged in the last four years as the main moderate-to-conservative voice in the party and rep ? resents the third ( and correct , I think ) point of view . DLC leaders such as Sam Nunn and Chuck Robb say that Dem ? ocrats keep losing the presidency because they are not credible on the " threshold issues " of national defense and " values . " According to Nunn , " There 's no way that we can continue to hand the Republicans the military forces , the flag , and the keys to the jail and expect to win . " The DLC ? often derided as the " Southern white boy 's caucus , " but actually much broader in membership than that ? is in the process of establishing a think tank and a citizens network to develop and sell ideas that will attract both minorities and middle-class voters who are turned off by the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalism . " It also wants to change party nominating procedures ? how , is not quite clear yet ? to enable a moderate to win the Democratic presidential nomination . Nunn , who decided not to run in 1988 , sounds like he will be more enthusiastic in 1992 . Others in the DLC mold include Lloyd Bentsen , Albert Gore , Richard Gephardt , Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton , and Bill Brad ? ley ( the lone non-DLC member on this list ) . The DLC 's political case is this : the Democrats have lost five out of the last six elections , winning narrowly only with a Southern moderate following a recession and a historic national scandal . " I do n't blame Dukakis for this loss , " said DLC Executive Director Al From . " This is the longest losing streak since right after the Civil War . " From observes that Dukakis got a larger percentage of the votes of self-identified Democrats ( 82 percent ) than any candidate since Lyndon Johnson . " Our problem is not a failure to mobilize our core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats . " According to CBS-New York Times exit polls , only 37 percent of the electorate identifies itself as Democrat now , down from 53 percent in 1964 and 46 percent in 1980 . " Jackson wants to bring out new voters , but that 's a solution offered time after time and never realized , " said From . " If our appeal is to the dispossessed , we 'll get only the dispossessed to vote for us . To win , we have to go where the people are . " Nunn said , similarly , " Every time you attempt to go left , you will bring out at least equal numbers of voters against you on the right . " Jackson emphatically wants to take the party left on defense , foreign policy , and the economy . While his 1988 primary opponents tended not to challenge him , Nunn and other DLC leaders say they will do so now . Nunn said that " of all the 1988 candidates , Jackson spoke about issues the most . He should be treated with real respect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public statement yet made about Jackson by a party official comes from a non-DLC member , Mark Siegel , a member of the Democratic National Committee , former Jewish affairs liaison in the Carter White House , and the party 's former executive director . He told the Wall Street Journal , " If Jesse Jackson takes over the Democratic Party , the party as we know it may be destroyed , and on the national level the Republicans will dominate American politics . The issue is ideology , not race . " For that , and for opposing Jackson 's Middle East position and past anti-Semitic remarks , Jackson reportedly is moving to have Siegel ousted from his at-large seat on the DNC . Combat between the DLC and Jackson is nowhere near that bitter yet , but Nunn indicated that he is not willing to concede that Jackson is the sole , dominant political leader of black America . " We ought to acknowledge a lot of black leaders , " he said , mentioning as examples Atlanta Mayor           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
