But the relics he handles are deadly. // Captain Vander Mast is one of the Belgian Army ' s top bomb hunters . He is part of a special military unit that does nothing but dig up munitions left over from World War I , including about 20 tons a year of aging chemical weapons. // ' ' I ' m afraid these things don ' t get any better with age , ' ' Vander Mast says , as he leads the way onto a concrete storage platform at the Army ' s Bomb Disposal Center , near this tiny Belgian village. // // Stacked on the open platform , like so many pieces of firewood , is row upon row of old chemical artillery shells . The storage platforms are not enclosed , although the bombs are sheltered by aluminum roofs to keep the sun off . This is crucial , since high temperatures can cause the gas inside the metal casings to expand , forcing out the lead filling plugs used on many World War I chemical arms. // Vander Mast stoops in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The slightest brush from his pencil , however , and half of a badly corroded fuse crumbles to the ground . Such disturbances pose no threat of sparking an explosion , he says , but do underline the problem of stockpiling such weapons. // Once exposed to the air , the decay of the metal shells accelerates . Officials regularly find leaking weapons tucked among the stockpile . These are usually placed in airtight canisters . Leaking chemicals have burned the hands of soldiers handling the arms , but no bomb-squad fatalities have been linked to such exposure. // Finds from Flanders to France // EXPERTS calculate that three out of 10 projectiles used in World War I never exploded . This explains the high number of unexploded armaments being found seven decades after the war. // In the past , the Belgians sealed old chemical munitions in concrete and tipped them into the sea . But in recent years , as environmental objections to ocean dumping mushroomed , they stockpiled the armaments. // They now have about 150 tons of vintage chemical arms - all stored at this small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most brutal battles of World War I took place. // But as the commander of the bomb-disposal unit points out , ' ' If you go to the other side of the border , it doesn ' t vanish . ' ' Col. Cory Deseyn is referring to the sweep of the World War I battlefront , stretching from Flanders in Belgium to northern Italy. // In France , weapon-disposal teams dig up 80 tons of old chemical weapons a year - German , British , and French shells . ' ' The stuff is still in good shape - it ' s still dangerous , ' ' says Rene Teller of Protection Civile , the agency charged with disposal. // Fishermen in the Baltic Sea have burned their hands pulling up remnants of German chemical weapons hastily sunk by the allies after World War II . Even in Britain , where chemical weapons were produced but never used , authorities stumble across the occasional cache of toxic munitions . The latest find was last year : 150 chemical artillery shells and mortars at an abandoned World War I arms depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dismantle and destroy old chemical arms . The United States is developing a similar capability - aimed mainly at destroying huge stockpiles of obsolete weapons stored at eight sites across the continental US. // But it ' s in Europe that the legacy of chemical weapons production seems to linger most dangerously. // A 70-year legacy // THE first use of poison gas in World War I was in Belgium - just a few kilometers from Poelkapelle . On a warm April afternoon in 1915 , German troops opened the valves on 6 , 000 canisters of liquid chlorine , sending a greenish-yellow cloud wafting over French positions at Langemark . In a single day , 5 , 000 French troops died . Another 10 , 000 were injured , and the era of large-scale chemical warfare had dawned. // Huge stocks of chemical arms were produced during both World Wars - but only used in the first. // Potential disposal problems never entered the calculus of European war planners . In the scramble to clean up battlefields after World War I , the Belgians pushed unexploded bombs into trenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result , bomb-removal teams today often find conventional and chemical bombs in the same hole . Belgian officials figure about 10 percent of the weapons they dig up are chemical. // ' ' Whenever there ' s a big road construction project anywhere in this area , we get a lot of calls , ' ' says Vander Mast. // The problem is especially acute in environmentally sensitive West Germany . Hitler ' s Army not only produced chemical weapons , but also developed more deadly nerve agents . After the war , the allies seized nearly 270 , 000 tons of chemical weapons , packing most of it on boats that were sunk in the North and Baltic Seas. // In Munster , a village nestled among the fields of northern Germany ' s Luneburg Heath , a massive cleanup is under way at the site of one of world ' s first chemical weapons facilities. // Chemical bombs tested in the surrounding hills during both World Wars are still being recovered . Some patches of ground are so contaminated with old poisons that no one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The West German Ministry of Defense operates a high-temperature furnace on the site , but admits it will take years to complete the cleanup . Bombs are X-rayed - to help identify their contents - then sawed open to separate the poisons from the explosive charges. // In September , a powerful explosion rocked the plant after workers failed to fully separate explosive charges from the chemicals . No one was injured , but the plant will be closed for at least six months for repairs. // Getting rid of old weapons isn ' t cheap // ' PEOPLE are discovering that it ' s much more expensive to destroy chemical weapons than it is to produce them , ' ' says Dr. Adolf-Henning Frucht , a chemical weapons expert in West Berlin. // Indeed , even old research facilities can spark controversy . In the Spandau section of West Berlin , officials have launched a massive cleanup at the site of one of the Third Reich ' s main chemical weapons research laboratories. // In the confused closing days of World War II , the Germans scurried to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ' s thought that many dangerous chemicals and nerve agents ended up in a well or were buried by the retreating German forces . No one knows how long it will take to do the excavation - or what they ' ll find. // Even after years in the ground , the chemical contents of bombs can be highly toxic. // ' ' Chemicals lose some potency over time , but not enough , ' ' says Gerhard Magin , the West German chemist at Munster who specializes in disposal issues . The rate of decay depends on many factors - such as the type of compound and whether it is exposed to the atmosphere. // Bombs filled with phosgene and hydrogen cyanide , materials used in World War I , are as poisonous now as they were when produced , Dr. Magin says. // In 1984 , workers at a British military cemetery in Ypres , Belgium , noticed that a swath of grass between the headstones had turned brown . The problem was traced to a leaking mustard-gas shell buried deep in the ground .

Investigators still aren ' t sure what caused the blast , although it is known that the soldiers died while trying to move some armaments. // //
