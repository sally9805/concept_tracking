As the first chill of winter swept across South Africa last week , a few white families braved the weather to relax on King 's Beach , a strip along the Indian Ocean in the eastern Cape city of Port Elizabeth . Parents reclined under striped umbrellas as black maids took the children to play in the waves . Not far away , a colored ( mixed race ) man , his wife and two small children enjoyed a picnic on the sand . For a brief time last month , such racially mixed scenes were countenanced by law at Port Elizabeth , after the state Supreme Court struck down local city ordinances that reserved beaches like King 's for whites only . But as the Pretoria government appealed the decision , apartheid once again ruled the seashore : thus last week 's black and colored beachgoers were outside the law . <P> Farther north , in Durban , a leading coastal resort , Mayor Henry Klotz was pondering his status as an outcast from President P.W . Botha 's National Party . Last month Klotz balked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best beaches for whites only . The beaches were the scene of confrontations between blacks and whites last summer . After his refusal to endorse the segregation plan , Klotz was suspended for " acting disloyally and contrary to the interests " of the party . Declaring that he was " duty bound to act in the interests of all the citizens , " the mayor resigned his membership . <P> At a time when the government holds an estimated 3,000 antiapartheid activists in detention , seaside segregation represents but a small facet of local life . Nonetheless , government efforts in support of whites-only bathing are generating skepticism about President Botha 's proclaimed intentions to reform the political system . Editorialized the Johannesburg Sunday Star : " It is almost impossible for the most moderate black , colored and Indian leaders to offer their services in seeking a negotiated constitution when Mr. Botha 's men are fighting to keep them and those whom they lead off the beaches , off white land , out of white group areas and the best schools . " <P> The Port Elizabeth court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Allan Hendrickse , head of the opposition Labor Party and a member of the Botha Cabinet , took a dip at King 's Beach . His action drew a strong rebuke from President Botha , who threatened to drop him from the Cabinet , dissolve Parliament and call a general election unless Hendrickse apologized . Hendrickse backed down , but two Port Elizabeth city councilors fought the restrictive beach ordinance up to the Supreme Court . The stricture was ruled invalid on a technicality , and Hendrickse announced that he was prepared to test the waters at other whites-only beaches . <P> The issue has provoked a backlash among white residents on the Natal and eastern Cape coasts . Many are supporting the rightist Conservative Party , which now forms the official opposition in the whites-only legislative House of Assembly . To buttress their case that segregation must be maintained in traditionally white bathing areas , the Conservatives point to " uncivilized " behavior by blacks , including topless bathing by black women , a practice that is anathema to many whites .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
