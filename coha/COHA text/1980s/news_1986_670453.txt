At the moment , the two sides are arguing over how definite a prospect was discussed at talks this month in Reykjavik , Iceland , on the elimination of all nuclear weapons in 10 years. // The Russians quote President Reagan as having raised the possibility of a total ban on nuclear weapons within 10 years and as having said that such an agreement , if achieved , might be signed when Mikhail S. Gorbachev , the Soviet leader , visits the United States for a summit meeting . The Americans insist that a ban on nuclear arms was meant to be a distant goal and that nothing concrete was agreed to in Iceland. // But the debate over the prospects has not cast much light on the question of whether such an attractive-sounding political goal is desirable militarily , and hence whether national leaders would ever agree to it. // // ' Somehow Tongue-in-Cheek ' // " I don ' t see how the Soviets could possibly consider it , " one retired general who continues to analyze strategic affairs said . " I think they proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arrangement might appear to favor the Soviet Union by " making the world safe for conventional warfare , " this analyst said , such an argument is not wholly persuasive because the Soviet Union would be reluctant to leave China , Britain and France with unopposed nuclear missile forces. // Nor is the idea palatable to the senior American military leaders who met this morning with President Reagan to discuss the future course of arms negotiations. // Their advice is considered likely to touch on the military ' s insistence that the President , who has often spoken of his desire to leave the world free of nuclear weapons someday , must not abandon military practicalities on the road to this dream. // For years , the military scorecard in Europe has prompted officers such as Gen. Bernard P. Rogers , the top military commander in the Atlantic alliance , to argue for an increase in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ' s conventional strength . But even General Rogers has never held out hope that nuclear weapons could be done away with altogether . <> <> ' We Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional force we are able to build , I still believe that we should retain some nuclear weapons and retain a first-use option , " he told an interviewer last spring . " I do not think that it is possible to reduce to a point that there are none on the face of the earth. " // Even setting aside the prospect of eliminating all nuclear weapons , the prospect of a phased elimination of ballistic missiles , the Administration ' s more modest goal , could create potential problems , according to some analysts. // At first , they say , the withdrawal of intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe would threaten to leave behind an imbalance in shorter-range nuclear missiles. // Under the formal plan put forward by the Administration at Reykjavik , this imbalance would be addressed by a quick freeze on such short-range systems , followed by the elimination of all ballistic missiles , including long- and short-range types . Other sorts of nuclear weapons , ranging from artillery to bombs , would remain in place . But no detailed assessment has been made of which side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reassuring Europeans // Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger spent several days last week reassuring European defense ministers that American negotiators in Geneva would be careful not to compromise the deterrent umbrella over Europe. // Those assurances might be harder to provide at the point , 10 years hence under the Administration ' s proposals in Iceland , when ballistic missiles such as the MX , the submarine-based Trident , or the planned mobile Midgetman were eliminated. // Mr. Weinberger explains that the President ' s arms control proposals require a " recalculation " of the strategic equations that have been taken for granted over the years . This work , he says , is just beginning . The military itself does not quite know how much money would be required for conventional forces in Europe to permit the withdrawal of what the military calls " theater " nuclear arms there , or what new technologies might be available to offset the elimination of ballistic missiles from the military balance. // Later on , with ballistic missiles gone , the technical prowess of the United States could prove a severe problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials believe that advanced American bombers and cruise missiles , using Stealth technologies to elude Soviet defenses , could give the United States an advantage once both sides dismantled their ballistic missiles . <> <> A Precarious Balance Seen // Other analysts of military affairs are not so certain . Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia , the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee , said that eliminating the missiles could leave the " strategic balance resting precariously on the shoulders of our respective bomber and air defense forces. " // In a recent speech , Senator Nunn said the Soviet Union has hundreds of radar installations , thousands of interceptor aircraft and tens of thousands of defensive missiles to ward off air attacks . The United States has nothing of the kind to protect itself , and would have to make an immense investment in such hardware to protect both the American continent and Europe. // If the United States is serious in its offer to eliminate ballistic missiles , it must believe that it would be better off in a world in which bombers and cruise missiles would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians to propose the total elimination of nuclear arms implies that they believe the United States and its allies could not build up a preponderance in conventional arms . <> <> Not the First Time // The Iceland talks did not mark the first time that the Soviet Union has proposed a timetable for eliminating nuclear weapons . In January 1986 , the Russian negotiators at Geneva suggested eliminating all nuclear weapons by the year 2000 . The phased reductions proposed at that time would have begun with the elimination of medium-range missiles , including American Pershing II and cruise missiles and Soviet SS-20 missiles stationed in Europe. // But that proposal was rejected out of hand by the Americans , who said it amounted to little more than a publicity gesture . Now that the American side is saying publicly that it shares this goal , at least in the long run , the questions raised by the military analysts suggest that both sides may be playing to emotions rather than military common sense . <> <> ICELAND SUMMIT : GIVE AND TAKE <> <> First Five Years <> <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary understanding to make 50 percent cuts in strategic , or long-range , weapons including ballistic missiles , bombers and cruise missiles . <> <> Second Five Years <> <> The White House contends that President Reagan proposed to eliminate all ballistic missiles , of all ranges , in the second five years , leaving intact the remaining 50 percent of other strategic arms . <> The Soviet Union says that it responded to President Reagan with a proposal to eliminate the remaining 50 percent of all strategic weapons . <> U.S. officials had been ambivalent on whether President Reagan agreed that there could be a ban on all strategic weapons . They now say that they have " no quarrel " with the Soviet contention that Mr. Reagan endorsed Mr. Gorbachev ' s proposal to eliminate all strategic weapons , but they insist no formal agreement was reached . <> Mr. Gorbachev said that President Reagan agreed to eliminate all long-range weapons , " albeit without special enthusiasm.
