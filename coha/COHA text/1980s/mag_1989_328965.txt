All seemed well when Washington lawyer Thomas Root , 36 , climbed into a Cessna 210 Centurion and took off from National Airport at 6:33 a.m . Thursday . He often piloted himself on business trips , and the 156-mile jaunt to Rocky Mount , N.C. , that his flight plan called for appeared routine . Two hours into his trip , however  --  and some 45 minutes after he was expected to land  --  Root radioed the Federal Aviation Administration at Leesburg , Va. , that he was suffering chest pains and having difficulty breathing . <P> As his plane crossed North Carolina and headed south over the Atlantic , it picked up a small convoy of escorting military craft that tried to make radio contact but failed . Root appeared to have suffered a heart attack ; pilots saw / him sprawled in the Cessna 's cockpit , apparently unconscious . For almost four hours the Cessna droned over the Atlantic on automatic pilot at about 10,000 ft . Finally , it ran out of fuel 15 miles from the Bahamian island of Eleuthera and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle into the sea and sank within six minutes . <P> Then came what seemed a miracle . Four medics who had been following the flight for its last hour aboard an Air Force C-130 cargo plane parachuted into the ocean , expecting at most to recover a body . To their amazement , they saw Root swimming toward them . Coast Guard Captain Dr. James Rahman later theorized that carbon monoxide leaking into the Cessna 's cabin caused Root to pass out but that the crash revived him . <P> He was bleeding from the abdomen and had fractured ribs , injuries presumed to have been caused by the crash . Root was flown to a hospital in Hollywood , Fla. , where he was reported first in critical , then in stable condition . Wife Kathy , 35 , sent him a tongue-in-cheek message : " Root , you really did it this time . " <P> But on Friday Hollywood police chief Richard Witt made a startling report . Exploratory surgery had led doctors to conclude that Root 's injuries resulted from a gunshot wound  --  apparently inflicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder burn surrounded the entrance hole . <P> After quizzing Root for 40 minutes , Andrew Alston , an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board , said the pilot admitted keeping a .32- cal . revolver in his plane 's glove compartment . But Root insisted that he recalled nothing about his flight from the moment he blacked out from " a shortness of breath " until it ended in the water . <P> Had Root tried to commit suicide and staged an elaborate show to make his death look like an accident ? Brett Geer , a brother-in-law who talked with Root in the hospital Friday , speculated that the lawyer 's gun may have gone off during the crash . Root , a father of three , is an avid gun collector . Last April , in a check of the Virginia hangar where he kept his plane , the police found 35 weapons ; one was unregistered . <P> One possible motive for suicide came to light when North Carolina 's secretary of state disclosed that his office was investigating Root 's role in an alleged security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his law practice , which specializes in helping investors get radio-station licenses . Root , who is said to be in financial difficulty , is under investigation by the U.S. Customs Service as a possible drug smuggler .
