Soaring 45 stories over downtown Dallas , the office tower called Lincoln Plaza looks like nothing more than an especially elegant variation on the modern commercial building . Mahogany granite and smoked glass combine to give it a handsome , robust exterior . Full-grown , verdant trees shade its attractive walkways , and at the apex of its triangular base a small waterfall gurgles and sparkles in the sun . Lincoln Plaza is not only beautiful  --  it has brains . Computers and closed-circuit monitors check the temperature on each floor , the location of every elevator and the status of all doors ( locked or unlocked ) . When a clerical worker began pilfering from his employer 's offices , the computers identified the owner of the electronic card key that was used to enter the burglarized rooms . The suspect was quickly apprehended . Says Steven Cole , the building manager : " I was very impressed . " <P> Welcome to the world of smart buildings , a marriage of architecture and computers that is the latest word in high-rise high tech . Walk into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically , triggered by infrared sensors that detect the slightest movement ; leave and the lights shut themselves off twelve minutes later . Desktop terminals linked to a centralized computer system offer instant access to the latest stock market quotations . A sophisticated telephone system automatically routes long-distance calls along the least expensive circuits . The elevators flash the current weather reports and talk to their passengers in a low , clear tone : " Going up . " <P> In the lobbies , computerized directories cross-list tenants by company , individuals ' names and service category . Sometimes they even offer calendars of arts and sports events , airport maps , taxi phone numbers and shuttle-bus guides . One particularly futuristic tower will soon permit a tenant at any display terminal to call up a lunch menu on the screen , punch in his order and have food delivered to his desk from one of the building 's restaurants . <P> Smart buildings have sprung up in Los Angeles ( Grand Financial Plaza ) , Chicago ( One Financial Place ) , Arlington , Va . ( Crystal Gateway III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under construction in Denver and New York City . " Tenants want their buildings as smart as their communications equipment , " says Geoffrey Wharton , a partner at Tishman-Speyer Properties in New York City , which is developing a smart building for the Equitable Life Assurance Society . Says William Caffery , a technology analyst at the Gartner Group , a research firm in Stamford , Conn. : " Communications is the air conditioning of the 1980s . " <P> The technology does not come cheap . Builders figure that electronic gadgetry and the wire and cable networks that connect them add about 2% to construction costs . Average rent at Chicago 's gleaming One Financial Place , a $220 million , 40-story chrome-and-marble trade palace that looks more like a hotel than an office building , runs from $29 to $33 per sq . ft. , which is 20% higher than space in the city 's other top commercial buildings .
