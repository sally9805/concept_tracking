Following Reagan-Gorbachev at Geneva comes another U.S.-Soviet confrontation at the summit . This time , though , the summit sits at somewhere under 20 feet and the summiteers are the world 's three best pole vaulters , Billy Olson , 27 , and Joe Dial , 23 , of the U.S. , and the U.S.S.R. 's overarching Sergei Bubka , 22 . Since the start of the year , the three have bettered one another 's indoor records six times , and during the past fortnight they have gone height to height in U.S. indoor track-and-field meets from New York to California and back again . The visiting Bubka emerged on top , winning three of the five meets and twice setting new records , the last at 19 ft. 6 1/4 in . Despite earlier cross-country tensions among the three , Bubka observed diplomatically at the finale , " Our competition is friendly competition . They will make further success . "
