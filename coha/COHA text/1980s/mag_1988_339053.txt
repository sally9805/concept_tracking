When TV Actress Valerie Harper and Lorimar Productions sued each other last year , it looked as if the case might drag on until 1992 before it even went to trial . After all , the Los Angeles court system is clogged with 150,000 new civil cases a year . But , instead , the mutual breach-of-contract suits  --  a fallout from Harper 's departure last summer from the NBC series Valerie  --  went to trial together last week . The shortcut ? With the blessings of the state court , both sides got together and hired a private judge . " I 'm very happy to have my day in court so quickly , " says Harper . <P> Former Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Hogoboom , who is hearing the suits , is one of several hundred so-called rent-a-judges active across the nation . The judges , who are retired from the regular bench , preside for fees that usually range from $150 to $300 an hour . In many cases , they act merely as arbitrators or nonbinding mediators . But in California and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also conduct proceedings  --  like the Harper- Lorimar trial  --  that have most of the trappings of regular court sessions , including depositions , witnesses and verdicts . The parties in the Harper- Lorimar dispute will jointly pay court costs of $15,000 a week , including $250 an hour for Judge Hogoboom . The case will be decided by a panel of jurors selected from the public jury rolls . <P> " More and more parties are agreeing to use the system , " says Harper 's attorney , Barry Langberg . The major reason is cost control . An early court date saves on attorney fees . So does the shorter proceeding that often results from special agreements between the two sides , such as a pact not to challenge the credibility of each other 's expert witnesses . The parties can also select a judge with experience relevant to their case , instead of taking the randomly assigned jurists of the public courts . <P> The rent-a-judge option began in 1976 in California , the state that still accounts for more than half of all such proceedings . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired judge , Joseph Wapner of TV 's People 's Court , which is in effect a televised private proceeding . But the system has spread . Judicate , a Philadelphia-based network of some 450 judges , has handled nearly 800 cases this year in 34 states . In some of the states where hired judges can conduct virtual trials , the verdicts can also be reviewed by the regular appeals courts . <P> Where rent-a-judge trials are appealable , those involved contend that only about 5% to 10% of such cases are taken to a higher court . Because both sides have chosen the judge , " it is hard , even for the losing party , not to accept the decision , " says William Polkinghorn , senior counsel for Bank of America , who takes part in about half a dozen such proceedings each year . Though popular first in contract and labor disputes , rent-a-judging has spread to malpractice , family law and other areas : 70% of Judicate 's caseload involves personal-injury suits .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
