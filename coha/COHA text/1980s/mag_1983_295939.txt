The Democrats , all together now , propose an opposition budget <P> Hoisting high their glasses of Harp Lager , Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill hailed St. Patrick 's Day at a luncheon in the Speaker 's lair on Capitol Hill . But the tableau of bipartisan spirits , which reflected the compromises that have been attained so far on Social Security and a $5 billion jobs program , may be the last symbolic display of unity for a while . Beneath the blarney was brewing what could turn out to be a bloody partisan battle . After the lunch was over , the House Budget Committee passed a plan designed by the Democratic leadership that sets up a showdown over the budget for fiscal 1984 , which begins in October . <P> Two years ago , Reagan won passage of his program for cuts in domestic spending and taxes by rolling over the House leadership with the help of a handful of dissident conservative Democrats . Last year a strained bipartisan budget compromise was reached that left the foundations of the Reagan approach in place . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , Speaker O'Neill passed the word to fellow Democrats that they would attempt to roll back Reaganomics with a budget plan of their own this year . <P> To start off the effort , Oklahoma Democrat James Jones , chairman of the Budget Committee , set up a series of briefings during which members filled in questionnaires designed to shape a party consensus . For example , 43% of the Democrats who participated in the poll voted for a 5% real increase in defense funding , and 41% preferred a 3% increase . In response , the leadership fashioned a consensus approach for its budget proposal , calling for 4% more defense spending , far below Reagan 's proposal for 10% growth . The Democrats also agreed on a plan to raise $30 billion in new revenues , perhaps by limiting the 10% income tax rate cut due to take effect in July , and to restore funds that have been cut from such domestic programs as child nutrition , food stamps and social services . " We know that behind the smokescreen of voodoo economics is the real need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democrats ' version of the budget . <P> Despite the committee 's approval of the budget package by a straight party vote , the fragile Democratic consensus may break down on the floor of the House : members will have to wrestle with the political problems inherent in hiking taxes and trimming defense funds in the face of presidential opposition . Even if the budget resolution passes the House , the far more contentious decisions over exactly which taxes to raise and which military programs to cut will have to be resolved in the Ways and Means , Appropriations , and Armed Services committees . Nor will the Republican-controlled Senate be an easy sell : despite G.O.P. sentiment to scale back Reagan 's defense increases , leaders in the upper chamber bowed to Administration pressure and delayed consideration of the budget until after Easter .
