Among the daily concerns of the residents , the contest for governor between the Republican-Conservative candidate , Lewis E. Lehrman , and the Democrat-Liberal , Lieut . Gov . Mario M. Cuomo , has not rated highly . Yet as the election nears , many are voicing opinions on the candidates and the issues , and in many cases their statements echo the messages the candidates have been broadcasting. // " Sweet Cider " reads the big red sign at Robert J. Bruce ' s Fruit Farm , and under it in letters bigger still , " Another family for Lehrman/ Emery . " The sign went up on Monday. // " I believe Lehrman more than I do Cuomo , " said the 69-year-old Mr. Bruce as he boxed fresh-picked Red Delicious apples and Macouns , a hybrid that is his favorite . " He promises to give jobs and get the people back to work , and this is what the country needs . I think Cuomo , he ' d be a carbon copy of Carey , and we need a change - too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 15 and 20 people during the height of harvesting his 6 , 000 trees , on the border between Cazenovia and Nelson . He says he knows what he ' s talking about when he says the biggest reason people are leaving New York State is because of taxes , a Lehrman refrain. // " I travel from here to Florida all the time , " said Mr. Bruce . " Four months of every year , I take a load of apples and I go to the farmers ' markets there and I see a lot of people , and they tell me why they left. " // Madison County is a Republican stronghold , a hilly country of dairy farms and clapboard houses with pumpkins on the front porches . But while the latest count showed registered Republicans outnumbering Democrats by more than 2 to 1 , people still like to call themselves " independents " when asked // For all the staunch Lehrman supporters like Mr. Bruce , there are other people asking questions about Mr. Lehrman , questions that Mario Cuomo would have them ask by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " I don ' t like Lew Lehrman ; he ' s trying to buy it , " said Pat Mahoney , a machine operator in the Oneida Ltd. silver factory who said he was an independent . He stopped to talk after picking up a slice of pizza during his half-hour lunch break. // " I want Cuomo because he was Lieutenant Governor , so he ' s next in line , " Mr. Mahoney explained . " Like they say , he has the experience. " // Dr. Ray Bepko , a psychologist with a red beard , has lived in Hamilton , the town that includes Colgate University , for four years and is part of the new migration of Democrats and independents trickling into the district. // Of Mr. Cuomo he says : " He ' s a New Yorker , O.K. ? My feeling is Lew Lehrman is attempting to buy the New York State governorship on his way between his homes in Pennsylvania and Greenwich , Conn. , as a stopover on his way to Washington . He ' s spending something along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected to a job that pays $85 , 000 a year ? It doesn ' t make sense to me. " // Other people shrug off this lopsided equation of election expenses to job remuneration . " He ' s got it , let him spend it , " said Michael Seamans , a 38-year-old maintenance man at the silver factory . " The only thing Lehrman ' s got going for him is the death penalty . That ' s why I ' m voting for him. " // Mr. Lehrman ' s tough-on-crime message has been heard here . " I think , with the crime , it has to be stopped someplace , " said Ellen Saccucci of Dolgeville , who was shopping at the Oneida Ltd. discount outlet . " Our laws are too lenient and flexible on that . Nobody ' s safe. " // But as for Mr. Lehrman ' s support of the death penalty , she says : " There I ' m on the fence . We ' ve seen where innocent ones were put to death. " // Mario Cuomo may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-New York City sentiment that Mayor Koch did in the primary race . " Cuomo as a Democrat is pretty well received up here , " said David W. Hollis , editor and publisher of The Oneida Daily Dispatch , which circulates in Madison County . The paper just endorsed Mr. Cuomo along with a number of local Republican officeseekers. // " I don ' t think people perceive him as being representative of New York City , " Mr. Hollis said . " As Lieutenant Governor , he had the affiliation with the rural affairs cabinet . He ' s been up here , not just campaigning , and I think that means a lot to people. " // Still , Mr. Hollis believes , Madison County will ultimately go to Mr. Lehrman , but the strength of the Republican turnout remains to be seen . " I don ' t think there ' s a lot of burning , pit-of-the-stomach politics , " Mr. Hollis said of the Governor ' s race , " and Lew Lehrman doesn ' t instill that . You don ' t see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s a kind of quiet reaction. " // " A lot of people have other concerns other than politics , " Mr. Hollis added. // Rosemary Pooler was a stand-in for Mr. Cuomo the other night in the Green Room at the Colgate Inn , and Gary Lavine was for Mr. Lehrman . The appearance of surrogates is an accustomed happening at candidates ' nights here , and these two - a member of the state ' s Public Services Commission and the counsel of the State Senate ' s Insurance Committee - knew their parts well. // Mrs. Pooler emphasized Mr. Cuomo ' s " many years of experience and insight . " He is , she said , " a man of strength and compassion who sticks to his beliefs and his word. " // Mr. Lehrman , according to Mr. Lavine , " represents a new approach to state government . " " A more decent human being than Mario Cuomo you are not going to find , " Mr. Lavine acknowledged , adding : " But his views are mushy , fuzzy . He stands mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when the panel , which included local Congressional and State Assembly candidates , had finished answering questions distributed to the audience beforehand by the League of Women Voters , a big man rose from the crowd of 70 to make a point . He was Nick Zupan , a Democrat who has a local sand and gravel company , oil drilling operations in other states and who voted for President Reagan. // " I don ' t care about Lew Lehrman or Mario Cuomo , because they don ' t know this district , " he said . " They don ' t even know we exist up here . All I hear is clean air and E.R.A. We won ' t have any clean air and E.R.A. if we don ' t bring industry and do something for the farmers in New York State . We ' re talking about New York City , U.S. Government ; we ' re covering world problems . They ' ll be representing the 111th District . Now I want to know what they ' re going to do for the farmer.
