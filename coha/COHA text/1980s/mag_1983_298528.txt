The President prepares for some prickly company <P> It will be Ronald Reagan 's first and only chance to be host at a Western economic summit meeting , * and for months , the President has been planning to make the three-day occasion memorably different from its eight predecessors . Above all , Reagan hopes to give the heads of government of Britain , France , West Germany , Italy , Japan and Canada a chance to chat in a relaxed , informal and authentically all-American style over the Memorial Day weekend . His choice of venue , the restored confines of colonial Williamsburg , seems perfect . <P> After arriving by U.S. Marine Corps helicopter , the leaders of the West will be taken by horse-drawn carriages to the Georgian-style Governor 's Palace . During their stay , the dignitaries will dine on such regional delicacies as batter-fried crayfish , Southern-fried chicken and Tex-Mex chile con carne , prepared under the direction of Chef Pierre Monet , formerly of Maxim 's in Paris . At the President 's insistence , the leaders will not even be burdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House aide put it , " The challenge is to keep things as natural as possible . " <P> If the discussions are as uninhibited as the schedule , then expressions of disquiet can be expected from at least a few of the Western leaders . The chief bone of contention : Reaganomics and stratospheric U.S. budget deficits . <P> A foretaste of what may be in store at Williamsburg came last week from French President Franois Mitterrand . At a press conference following a meeting with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , Mitterrand lashed out at American economic policy and complained that " it is not normal for the U.S. budget deficit to be paid by us in Europe . " His meaning : U.S. shortfalls are the prime cause for continuing high international interest rates ; these , in turn , could squelch the hesitant economic recovery in Western Europe . As a side effect , the level of interest rates has powerfully augmented the value of the U.S. dollar against other major Western currencies . Mitterrand therefore called for a " new Bretton Woods " conference among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of stable exchange system between Western currencies that prevailed from 1944 until 1971 . <P> To a great extent the French and the other allies have reason to complain . The enormous U.S. deficits require extensive borrowing and keep money tight on both sides of the Atlantic ; if they continue , they risk causing renewed world recession . The 3 West Europeans , including the Socialist Mitterrand government , also feel aggrieved because they are making rigorous efforts at fiscal austerity . As a percentage of national output , the projected U.S. deficit ( 6.3% of G.N.P. ) is nearly twice as large as those of France , Britain and West Germany , and more than three times as great as Japan 's . The rise in value of the U.S. dollar has another adverse effect since the cost of petroleum is denominated in U.S. dollars , meaning that francs , marks and other currencies buy less oil . This year the slippage of the franc against the dollar will add an estimated $1 billion to France 's oil bill .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
