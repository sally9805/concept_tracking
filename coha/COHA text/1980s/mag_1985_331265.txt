This week 's cover story , an unusual and intimate encounter with a group of people living in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn , is rooted in a particular locale , across Upper New York Bay from the glittering office towers of Manhattan and within sight of the Statue of Liberty . But the setting could have been any town or neighborhood in America where people are struggling against poverty and distress  --  and where other people are reaching out to help and comfort them . Hardship and helping know no season , of course , but it seemed that Christmas week would find Americans readier to respond to such a story . <P> Senior Writer Roger Rosenblatt , who reported and wrote the story , decided early on to focus on Sisters Geraldine and Mary Paul and their Center for Family Life . " These two remarkable nuns , carrying out their vows to practice charity , came in 1978 to an area that was as poor and dangerous as you could find in New York City , " says Rosenblatt . " But theirs was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real needs of the neighborhood . " <P> Over a period of six weeks , Rosenblatt met with countless residents of Sunset Park . By agreeing not to use their real names and agreeing to change some details of their lives , he persuaded them to talk with extraordinary candor . He also drew on copious background information provided by Reporter- Researcher Zona Sparks about Sunset Park . <P> As his reporting progressed , Rosenblatt came to see that poverty was " only the context for a fundamental exchange between the nuns and their clients , between giving and needing . This story is about a group of people who simply do not want to lie down and die , and about another group of people who refuse to let them . " Capturing this Sunset Park spirit are illustrations by Martin Wong , a Chinese-American painter making his first appearance in TIME . <P> On Sunday , Dec. 29 , a syndicated TV network of 104 stations , assembled by LBS Communications , will broadcast a one-hour special called TIME 's Man of the Year . Produced by Reeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first-ever look at how TIME 's editors , writers and correspondents select the Man of the Year and produce the stories for the cover package .
