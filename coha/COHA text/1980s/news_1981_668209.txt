The little boy made it a Norman Rockwell scene . The blue cap with white lettering spelling out SOX was pulled down to the tops of his ears . A little tuft of blond curled from beneath the cap in the back . Slowly , he circled a pack of reporters who had backed Carlton Fisk into the far corner of the baggage room in the visiting clubhouse at Fenway Park , firing questions nonstop at the hero of the day . After listening patiently for a few minutes , nine-year-old Casey Fisk turned away , offering to no one in particular with a deadpan expression on his face : " What ' s the big deal anyway ? It was only a three-run homer . " With that , he left Carlton Fisk on his own to be probed for the depths of his emotions , from the time he got up anxiously at 5:30 a.m. to the moment he entered the Chicago clubhouse , carrying his own three bats and catching equipment , hero of the White Sox ' 5-3 Opening Day win at Fenway Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2-0 Boston lead in the eighth inning and sent the Red Sox reeling . " It was a great feeling , " he said , being prompted time and again to say it was more pleasurable than his dramatic home run in the sixth game of the 1975 World Series , something he refused to do . " That was the World Series , " he said . " There was more focus on it . I knew when I hit that one that it was going out of the park . The only question then was whether it was fair or foul . " Today , I didn ' t think it was a home run . I thought it was going to be off the wall , which made me excited because all I wanted to do was knock in at least one run . Make it 2-1 and get us back in the ballgame . I didn ' t know it was a home run until I got to second base and saw the umpire give the signal that it was gone . " Fisk was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush fell over Fenway Park at the point of impact . The crowd really didn ' t know which way to react after reacting to Fisk in various ways all afternoon . " I didn ' t notice anything about the crowd when I went around the bases . When I turned second , I looked into our dugout and saw our guys dancing around , and that made me happy . " Our Guys . . . Carlton Fisk calling the Chicago White Sox our guys , after being such a fixture with the Boston Red Sox for so long . . . " I had been with the Red Sox organization for 14 years , " he said . " This was my 10th Opening Day at Fenway Park , but my first with the visiting team . I was nervous , but I didn ' t feel any pressure . I honestly wasn ' t concerned about how the fans were going to react to me . " I thought it would be mostly positive , which I feel it was . I knew there would be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I don ' t think I ever gave them any reason in all of the years I played here to feel any differently . " If some are mad at me ( for leaving as a free agent ) , they simply don ' t know the whole story and probably never will . It hasn ' t all been told yet . " Yes , this was an emotional experience . I was more nervous today than I was my first game as a rookie . But it was a nice kind of nervous . An exciting nervous , when you want to go out and play some hardball , which is what happened after my first time at bat . " Fisk grounded to the pitcher in the first , got a lucky single on a windblown popup in his second chance and was struck out by Dennis Eckersley before taking advantage of old friend Bob Stanley in a relief role in the eighth . There were two on and one out , and his team was down by two runs when Fisk came to the plate against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the plate because Stanley has one of the best sinkers in the league . And that ' s what he threw me . " " Was it wet or dry ? " was the question , referring to Stanley ' s growing prominence as one of the best spitball pitchers in the major leagues . " Wet , " laughed Fisk , " and he ' s got one of the best ones . " On his way around the bases and back to the dugout ( where he bunny-hopped the last three steps into the arms of his teammates , Fisk was looking for his wife Linda in the stands . " I was looking for her , " he said , " but I didn ' t know where she was sitting . I wanted to give her some kind of sign . Something for recognition . When I got into the dugout , Casey was so excited he didn ' t know what to do with himself . " After the game there were so many members of the media looking for his time that Fisk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where the baggage is stored . He remained behind a pile of trunks at the request of the media even though he was reluctant to do so . " I don ' t want them ( his new teammates ) to think I ' m any different , " Fisk said . " But if you guys want to do it here , it ' s OK with me . " Fisk had a plate of food sitting on a trunk in front of him , but he never got a chance to touch it for nearly an hour . At times during the interviews he simply stopped and smiled to himself , as if saying inwardly : " This is just too much to believe . " " I thought it was a good baseball game , " he said . " You generally remember Opening Days more than any other game of the season unless you get to the playoffs or World Series . There is something special about playing in an opener . " Because of the sun and shadows in the park today , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s why I told our pitchers to keep the ball up in the strike zone ( rather than down as they usually would ) because it was tougher to see the ball up high . " Eckersley really pitched well for them . I went to the plate trying to hit against him like I was catching him , trying to figure out what he was going tothrow next . That wasn ' t the smart thing to do . " I really didn ' t have much input before the game when we went over the Boston hitters . You know , when you are on a team so long , you just don ' t sit in the dugout and watch your own guys trying to figure out their strengths and weaknesses . I think they are going to have the type of team that can beat anyone on a given day , either with their bats or their pitching . But I haven ' t second-guessed myself about believing . I did what I had to do in view of the circumstances . " When the conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of his father with a quarter in his hand . " Dad , " he said excitedly , " look what I just found out on the field . " Carlton Fisk took the quarter , examined it slowly , as he placed one arm around his son ' s shoulder and pulled him to his side . " Son , " he answered , showing his New Hampshire background , " you better go out and look for more . " The youngster didn ' t . He circled behind his dad , dropped to his knees , and started unbuckling his father ' s shin guards , which normally would have been removed an hour before .
