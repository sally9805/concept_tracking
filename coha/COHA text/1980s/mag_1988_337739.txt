On this raw , gusty winter morning , Mary Goodrum is wishing she were someplace else than the cab of an 18-wheeler on an abandoned Texas airfield . <P> Goodrum is hunched over the wheel of a Freightliner , straining with all her 106-lb. might to maneuver 61 ft. of tractor-trailer into a parking space that does n't look large enough for two Corvettes . Like most novice truck drivers , she is confronted by too many tasks demanding simultaneous attention : eyeballing six side-view mirrors , working a gargantuan steering wheel and a muscle-wearying clutch pedal , and monitoring an instrument panel befitting a 727 . Goodrum eases the rig back until . . . kerplunk , she mashes into a barricade of tires . <P> Disgusted , Student Goodrum , 49 , jumps out and watches an instructor effortlessly slide her rig back into the hole . She joins other dejected novices who have flunked the backing test . " This is grueling , " she sighs . <P> Nothing is very easy here at the American Truck Driving School of Texas , a boot camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a driver who may never have driven a car with a stick shift and , in three weeks of nonstop instruction , turn the greenhorn into a licensed , road-ready trucker . That means endless hours of double-clutching around a 3.2-mile course of rutted concrete while dodging orange traffic cones and 50 other student truckers . <P> An instructor warns new recruits of the rigors : " You ca n't come in here with a hangover . This is no vacation . We 're giving you nothing . You 're going to work for it . " Rows of bleary-eyed , mostly young faces nod grudgingly . Most have forked out $3,000 in tuition fees for practical reasons  --  they want better jobs and more money  --  and they prefer what Curriculum Director George Beaulieu promises them the next day : " M-O-N-E-Y . Big trucks , big bucks . " <P> And the jobs are out there for the picking . Thanks to deregulation of the trucking industry in 1980 , there is a growing demand for nonunion drivers . Tighter licensing procedures and drug screening have worsened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a variety of offers , some paying more than $30,000 a year . <P> No wonder , then , that such a motley class has assembled here on the bleak prairie outside Waco . There are a former helicopter pilot and a nurse , out-of- work oil roughnecks and two grandmothers , a bookkeeper and a county jailer . Even a computer programmer . People with lives gone sour or careers on hold . People treading water , looking for a break . For them the open road beckons as a great new beginning . " I 'll make my husband 's $45,000 within two years , " whispers Goodrum . She and a friend have enrolled so they can travel the country with their trucker husbands . An appliance technician is here because " there are too many technicians in Fort Worth . " The pilot " wants to see life on the ground " and sock away a retirement kitty .
