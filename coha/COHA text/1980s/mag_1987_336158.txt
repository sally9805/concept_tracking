For the Soviet Union it was a case of the unthinkable becoming reality : Glasnost , a 55-page unauthorized journal of comment whose editor had served nine years in prison for his dissident views , was being allowed to circulate freely . In a country for so long enmeshed in secrecy , a publication openly printing what it pleased was certain to be quashed . In early August the paper Vechernaya Moskva ( Evening Moscow ) accused the new journal of waving " anti- Soviet banners . " The future for Glasnost and its editor , Sergei Grigoryants , looked bleak indeed . <P> But nothing has happened . Glasnost , like Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev 's policy of the same name ( meaning openness or public disclosure ) , has survived and expanded . Two weeks ago , the second edition of the magazine , now up to 184 pages , was distributed . Among the articles : details of new emigration rules and recent actions by the KGB  --  subjects barely covered by the official press . Whether the Vechernaya Moskva article was intended as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only two years ago Grigoryants would have been bundled off to a labor camp . Instead , like the editors of the country 's 8,500 approved newspapers and 1,500 magazines , he remains at liberty to test the boundaries of press freedom , Soviet style . <P> Since Gorbachev came to power in 1985 , calling for greater candor in reporting domestic affairs , censorship of the press has come under increasing challenge by editors and reporters . Many now feel free to debate government action , criticize officials , stir up controversy and publish readers ' opinionated letters about the bureaucracy , all without consulting the censors of Glavlit , the organization that protects state and military secrets . Articles on drug addiction , prostitution and youth gangs are unveiling the darker side of Soviet society . Disasters such as mine accidents , floods and train crashes , once ignored by the press , are now routinely covered . " We are working on enthusiasm and adrenaline , " says Dmitri Biryukov , 32 , foreign editor of the weekly Ogonyok ( Little Flame ) . <P> Perhaps the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stilted Izvestia . The official government newspaper is selling 8 million copies a day , up from 6.7 million two years ago , thanks to its transformation under Editor Ivan Laptev into a lively collage of reporting and commentary . " For Soviet readers , Izvestia is the most interesting newspaper around , " says Ogonyok 's Biryukov . In early August the paper published an interview with a military officer whose duty it is to push the launch button at a nuclear missile center . Never before had a Soviet publication reported in such detail on a missile site and the men who operate it .
