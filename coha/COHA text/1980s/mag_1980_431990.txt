 | He spent the better part of a lifetime imagining the moment of death . He pictured it on trains , in a shower , in the lobby of the United Nations , on the face of the Statue of Liberty . He even imagined directing his own ideal death : first he would devour a splendid meal and then be killed by " a smashing blonde . " In the end , however , the Master of Suspense died , as he had lived , quietly . At 80 , Alfred Hitchcock ? Sir Alfred since January ? succumbed to natural causes last week in his home in Los Angeles surrounded by his wife of 53 years , Alma , his daughter and his three grandchildren . He made 54 feature films during a prodigious career that started in silent films and incorporated every technological advance in the medium 's history . The Hitchcock film became a genre unto itself , eagerly awaited by movie lovers the world over , leaving behind a stream of images that have become archetypes of suspense , anxiety , passion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : there will be no new Hitchcock filtns to look forward to . " Hitch is a gentleman farmer who raises gooseflesh , " Ingrid Bergman said at last year 's American Film Institute tribute to the director . The young Francois Truffaut , writing in 1954 , put it differently : " He is the man we love to be hated by . " For years Hitchcock was unanimously hailed as a master manipulator , a prankster-craftsman whose sole purpose was to capture his audience in his elegant traps . Pantheon : For the sheer entertainment of " The 39 Steps , " " The Lady Vanishes , " " Rebecca , " " Notorious , " " North by Northwest " and " Psycho , " he deserves a place in the cinematic pantheon . But there have proven to be as many ways of looking at a Hitchcock film as there are Hitchcock films to look at . Where one critic salutes " North by Northwest " as " a prime example of contentless virtuosity , " another produces a 100-page analysis of its intricate Oedipal content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technician ; to his admirers , everything from a profound moralist to a Catholic metaphysician . The controversy that surrounds Hitchcock 's work is at the heart of the eternal debate about the nature of movies as art , and of popular culture itself . Perhaps no man better embodied the ambiguous role of the modern popular artist . His life was as compulsively designed as his films , which were so meticulously planned before shoot-@# ing that he saw the act of filming almost as a redundancy . Born in Edwardian London , the son of a greengrocer and educated by Jesuits , the solitary boy received a lesson in guilt and obedience when he was taken to a police station and locked in a cell for five minutes . " This is what we do to naughty boys , " announced the officer in what has become Hitchcock 's favorite explanation for his lifelong fear of the police . Ghoul : Whatever naughtiness he retained came out only on the screen . In his private life he remained a model ? almost a parody ? of reticent British propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in his shirtsleeves . He moved to Hollywood in 1939 to make " Rebecca " and lived there the rest of his life , playing out his public image as a droll , macabre ghoul on the " Alfred Hitchcock Presents " TV show . But he remained a shy , private outsider , disdaining the glitter of the town 's social whirl for the pleasure of quiet domesticity . Hollywood 's attitude of distant respect can be heard in producer David O. Selznick 's assessment : " Not a bad guy .. . although not exactly a man to go camping with . " Repression , in Hitchcock 's case , was the mother of invention . He once confessed to the journalist Oriana Fallaci that he was " frightened of everything : burglars , policemen , crowds , darkness , Sundays . " Also of arguments , his own movies , and eggs ( " They revolt me , " he said , and one immediately recalls the unforgettable image of Jessie Royce Landis stubbing out her cigarette in an egg yolk in " To Catch a Thief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me much . I do n't understand how people can waste so much time over sex : sex is for kids , for movies ? a great bore . " Embrace : Yet few filmmakers have ever used the medium with such sensuous grace , such visceral power . What image of tortured , obsessive sexuality can match the 360-degree tracking shot that surrounds Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak as they embrace in " Vertigo , " a feverish green light illuminating their kiss as reality literally blacks out behind them , the present obliterated in Stewart 's necrophilic desire to turn Novak into the image of his lost , dead love ? Hitchcock 's earliest British films , such as " Blackmail , " showed the influence of the German expressionist cinema , and if his later style became more fluid , romantic and humorous , he always maintained the expressionist 's bias : not to capture reality on film , but to create his own reality ? a closed , insulated world in which the audience 's responses could be cali-@#  | brated with a scientist 's precision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man Who Knew Too Much , " and the following year with " The 39 Steps . " Along with the lighthearted " The Lady Vanishes , " these fleet-footed entertainments became the most beloved of Hitchcock 's British period and were frequently invoked by critics to denigrate his Hollywood films as swank , solemn concessions to commercialism . Their popularity has obscured the brilliance of such less familiar early works as " Rich and Strange " ( 1932 ) , a fascinating nonthriller about a pair of naive newlyweds on a disillusioning world tour , or his appropriately dark adaptation of Joseph Conrad 's " The Secret Agent , " called " Sabotage , " in which the director shocked his audience by blowing up a bus carrying an innocent child and a puppy . Many of the motifs that he would develop more fully in America can be seen in these films . One of his favorites was the " wrong man " theme , in which an innocent is pursued by both the criminals and the police .

He concocted unusual settings for scenes of violence ( the famous climax of " The Man Who Knew Too Much " in the Royal Albert Hall , in which a musician 's cymbals become the symbol of the impending moment of death ) and had a penchant for making the villains more interesting than , and often almost as sympathetic as , his heroes . Complexity : Hollywood brought out Hitchcock 's paranoid romanticism and its undertones of sexual guilt , misogyny and morbid obsession . " Notorious , " his masterpiece of the ' 40s , can be enjoyed purely as an elegant spy thriller , but it is at heart a love story of troubling complexity , in which only the finest moral line separates Cary Grant ? who forces Ingrid Bergman to marry a Nazi spy ? from the spy ( Claude Rains ) , who loves her with equal ardor .

" It was the great ' 50s and early ' 60s films ? " Strangers on a Train , " " Rear Window , " " Vertigo , " " North by Northwest , " " Psycho , " " The Birds " and " The Trouble With Harry , " his study in pure whimsy ? that started the critical elevation of Hitchcock from the status of entertainer extraordinaire to that of major artist . The young French critic-filmmakers ? Truffaut , Claude Chabrol and Eric Rohmer ? compelled us to consider the unorthodox proposition that a mainstream commercial moviemaker could be a profound interpreter of the human condition . While the critical battles raged ( and still rage ) , Hitchcock himself adopted the impassive mask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the subject matter ; I do n't care about the acting ; but I do care about the pieces of film and the photography and the sound track and all the technical ingredients that made the audience scream , " he told Truffaut in a book-length interview . His love of technical challenges inspired " Rope , " a 1948 film that gives the illusion of having been shot in one uninterrupted take . ( Actually , it was shot in eight ten-minute takes . ) For him , the pleasure of " Psycho " was solely in seeing an audience " aroused by pure film . " Nightmares : To the skeptics , this is proof enough of Hitchcock 's shallow , manipulative esthetic ( as if all film were not " manipulative " ) . To his champions , it bespeaks merely a frustrating reluctance to discuss larger meanings . But does it matter what an artist says about his own work ? Or even if he grasps its implications ? The wonder of Hitchcock 's coldly conscious artistry is that it allowed the most dangerous unconscious impulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made exquisite entertainments out of his own ? and our ? deepest nightmares . " He is essentially apuritan , " concluded Bernard Herrmann , the late film composer . " Yet , it 's the puritanical artist that achieves real sexual expression because he conveys his ideas poetically through atmosphere . " And it is the true popular artist who can make millions of fans respond as one . Cheap thrills are a perishable commodity . We outgrow the haunted house at an amusement park . But Hitchcock 's movies have already passed the test of time ; the best of them , revisited , get better and better . Dazzlingly sophisticated ? and utterly primal ? they are as good a definition of the magic and power of movies as any we are likely to get .
