txt THE ILLINOIS Appellate Court Tuesday reversed the 1979 conviction of Thomas J. Curoe , a former assis- , tent United States attorney here , who was sentenced to 30 months ' probation after being convicted of diverting funds from an estate he administered as a private attorney . The appeals court ruled that Curoe had been indicted by a grand jury on the basis of unsworn testimony . He was indicted not by the grand jury that investigated the case , but by a second grand jury that heard the evidence summarized by a prosecutor who had not been sworn as a witness ; the court said . Observers said it is not uncommon for evidence to be passed to a subsequent grand jury , but it usually is passed by sworn testimony or bywerbatim reading of transcripts . " We believe it would be anomalous if an indictment could be returned solely upon the unsworn representations of a witness appearing before the grand jury . . . . No citizen would be immune from the indignities , time , and expense involved in defending against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ' testimony ' of a person who need not fear suffering the penalties of contempt or perjury for giving false evidence , " the court said . CUROE WAS CONVICTED of converting $326,000 of the estate to his personal account by transferring the money from the estate account through several checks . His defense was that he had taken money for investments that would earn more interest than could be earned in a bank , and that he had covered withdrawals : from the estate account with promissory notes . The appellate court commented that the evidence against him in the trial court " clearly established " that Curoe intended to deprive the heirs of the money , and that the promissory notes were " unsecured , unverified , and unwitnessed . " Curoe voluntarily disbarred himself from practicing law after an investigation by the Attorney Registration and Discipline Commission of the Illinois Supreme Court . As a federal prosecutor in the 1960s , Curoe won respect and attention for convicting scores of tax cheaters.                @ @ @ @ @
