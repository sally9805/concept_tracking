 | Just as he seemed to be controlling the damage from the Iran-Contra debacle , Ronald Reagan now finds his administration ensnared in another crisis that could be every bit as threatening to national security . A growing sex-forsecrets scandal in the supersensitive U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union has the President scrambling once again to appear in command but not responsible for the episode . By blaming the Kremlin while hinting broadly that the implications for U.S.-Soviet relations " are widespread , " the President has so far avoided heavy damage , but leaders of both the State Department and Marine Corps are coming under heavy fire . For now , as the bad news tumbles down , Reagan insists that the Soviets will not occupy their new complex in Washington until the U.S. is convinced that its new Moscow embassy is secure . It 's likely , however , that the new diplomatic complex , rising next to the current embassy , will have to be destroyed and rebuilt because it is hopelessly riddled with snooping devices , all of which may never be detected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major security breach mounting , a shaken Washington is looking at embassies in other capitals , fearing that they may be equally vulnerable . And with State Department plans to construct new embassies in six Communist nations ? East Germany , Hungary , Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia and China ? over the next two years , the search for solutions is already well under way . Remedies for the problem are expensive , however , and the quick fixes now under consideration would seem to do little to address longterm security concerns . The arrest last week of still another Marine ? Sgt. John Weirick , 26 , of Eureka , Calif. ? on suspicion of espionage during a 1981-82 tour at the Leningrad consulate brings to four the number of Marine guards implicated in the evolving scandal . There are also indications that the " fraternization " with Soviet women , as the State Department delicately puts it , is not limited to embassy guards . U.S. officials say that improper contacts with Soviet citizens , as well as other problems , have led to the recall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support employes . The Americans had replaced some of the Soviet workers who were pulled out last fall amid a diplomatic showdown . The current debacle , the worst ever to hit U.S. embassy security , is sending tremors through the White House and the Pentagon , but the diplomats in the State Department , and particularly Secretary of State George Shultz , have been hardest hit . With Shultz in Moscow this week for three days of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze , security specialists at State must insure that he will have secure communications . President Reagan refused to scrub the trip , saying it must not seem that the U.S. was " run out of town . " Yet there remains a strong presumption that the old embassy is a security sieve , infested with electronic bugging devices believed to have been hidden by the Soviets with the connivance of the Marines . Washington has shipped to Moscow a trailer with state-of-the-art gear said to insure that Shultz can send and receive messages without interception . In the embassy , he may use a new 8-by-10-foot cubicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room whose security may have been broken . More unsettling news about the old embassy came from two lawmakers who flew to Moscow for snap inspections . Representatives Dan Mica ( D-Fla. ) and Olympia Snowe ( R-Me. ) discovered in the existing building substandard security alarm systems and heard Marine complaints that diplomats paid no heed to security procedures . Snowe called the situation inside the embassy a " hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil ' tendency towards ... security . " The two also said they found " hard evidence " of bugging in the new embassy but declined to elaborate . Back home , as the Central Intelligence Agency and other departments weigh solutions , the rhetorical heat is being turned up by lawmakers ? and not all of them are Democrats . Embarrassed by yet another scandal during Reagan 's watch , the Senate Republican leadership has proposed tough measures curbing U.S. travel by Cuban and East-bloc envoys and demanding that the Kremlin pay for removing embassy bugs . " If the Soviets play this dangerous game , " says Senate Minority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can play . " At the White House , Reagan aides maintain that the President can not be blamed for the scandal . True , they concede , his own advisory panel did warn in 1985 of trouble brewing at the Moscow embassy , and a Senate panel echoed the caution only last year . But they also argue that the problems predate Reagan 's arrival ? and , in fact , such espionage is far from new . What are new are the apparent extent of the damage and the alleged cooperation of Marine guards , whose service projects an image of utter incorruptibility . Much of the past spying has occurred because the Americans either failed to take into account Soviet cleverness or were simply negligent . In the 1950s and 1960s , for instance , U.S. diplomats in Moscow felt their cars provided airtight security . They slowly tumbled to the fact that their radios had been " adjusted " by Soviet mechanics to serve as twoway radios , broadcasting all that was said to the KGB . More recently , in the 1970s , Marines were caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Russian women , the Marines were blackmailed by the KGB into selling the only documents they could lay hands on ? the contents of burn bags . In perhaps the most curious instance , a shipment of typewriters from the U.S. wound up in an unguarded embassy room adjacent to the workshop of one " Radio Sasha , " resident Soviet electronics wizard . When the typewriters went into use , U.S. officials found many had been transformed , no doubt by Sasha , into transmitting devices . " If they see a vulnerability , " says a veteran U.S. envoy , " they exploit it . " Soviet efforts to undermine security at U.S. embassies are nothing new . If the stories of KGB defectors are credible , the campaign is strongest , and most effective , in Eastern Europe , followed by friendly Third World countries . Other targets for KGB penetration of U.S. stations : Hong Kong , New Delhi , Paris , Brussels , Geneva and Vienna . Older Marines , tighter rules For years , the CIA has pointed out security problems to the diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the recom mended precautions cost big money . But others ? as investigators from two congressional panels , the Pentagon and a special presidential commission are already learning ? require just plain old common sense . Some prescriptions , for instance , would require that : Marines sent to sensitive posts be married , older ? over 25 ? and more experienced , having served at least one hitch . Employing younger leathernecks and depriving them of females is to invite disaster . One proposal calls for guards to take twice-yearly lie-detector tests , as CIA employes now do . Moscow might also be made a special hardship post , with Marines rotated every 90 days . Embassy workers avoid using word processors or even electronic typewriters , both of which emit signals that may be picked up . When possible , employes should shun electronic transmissions and instead use the tried-and-true diplomatic pouch . Only architectural and engineering firms with security clearances be hired to build top-secret embassy communications centers . Although clearances are now required , a survey has shown that 30 centers ? including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper credentials . Obviously , some of the other proposed remedies will be expensive , requiring more-elaborate facilities and well-paid security personnel . The most expensive single project , however , could well be in Moscow . As U S. News first reported last year , the new embassy compound is so shot through with bugs , many sown in concrete used for the foundation and walls , that the $191 million structure may be a total loss and need to be destroyed . Any hope that the new embassy was not completely vulnerable vanished last week with disclosure of a yet unpublished Senate Foreign Relations Committee report . It found that a Soviet emigre named Herman Silber was hired in  | 1975 by the San Francisco architectural firm of Skidmore , Owings and Merrill to help design the new embassy . Apparently working without security clearances , he finished in about five months , then vanished . Moscow later said he died of a heart attack . Commented an astounded Senator Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt . ) : " Our general contractor is the KGB . . . . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . " Not all the news on the horizon is bleak , however , and some solutions under consideration could actually wind up saving money . Intelligence experts in Washington want the State Department to drop its $250 million plan to link all embassies by computer . Even amateur hackers have shown that the most sophisticated system can be cracked with enough time , effort and brains . For all the hand wringing in the U.S. , America has resorted to aggressive tactics of its own in the unending superpower spy war . It planted bugs in the chancery of the Soviet Union 's new $65 million Washington diplomatic complex when it was being built in 1979 . It is ironic that the Moscow spy caper now could provide the excuse some have long sought to prevent the Soviets from using their new Washington embassy , still unoccupied . Approved during the cozier days of detente , the complex sprawls atop one of the capital 's highest hills , vastly improving Moscow 's access to sensitive U.S. government telecommunications . In the long run , America 's Moscow losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the vacancy sign at the Soviet Embassy .
