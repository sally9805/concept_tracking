txt ARE YOU READY for spring ? I never am . It comes upon us so suddenly . Just as we 've all had our fill of winter , suddenly the trees burst into fresh green finery and every item in our wardrobes seems old and dreary . It 's a good time to perk up the wardrobe with something new and springy . How about a terrific new crocheted handbag ? They 're quick and easy to make and the variations are limited only by your imagination . Spring seems to be the season for carrying things around , and , just by varying its size , this crocheted bag can become a generous-size tote with an eye towards beach season . Or go to the opposite extreme : Make It tiny and It becomes a colorful piece of jewelry to be worn around the neck on a twisted cord . A little bigger and it 's a disco bag . Or a change purse . The choice is yours ! Yarn choice is yours , too , and never was it so wide . Stores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shiny silks , butcher string , even ribbons , cords , and raffia . Nearly anything flexible enough to crochet will do . If you live in a big city , you 'll probably have access to specialty shops with all sorts of interesting ' summery yarns with a high cotton or linen content . If you ca n't find these off-beat , nubby yarns , do n't despair . Even dime stores carry an interesting range of crochet cot tons and heavier rug yarns . DO N'T OVERLOOK bits and pieces of strings and yarns you may have around the house . They can add stripes of color and texture to your bag . Woolly yarns might be a bit too wintery for a spring bag , particularly in deep colors . But if you have some brights around , they might do ? especially if you combine them with some springy-looking cotton yarns . So pack away your serious leather handbags and make a whole wardrobe of fresh new ones . The ecru " string " yarns are a natural ( no pun intended ! ) for spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your closet . Or combine colors to mix and match with your existing wardrobe . Colors can be worked in stripes . Or use two colors at once for a tweed effect . Using two yarns at once also makes a much stronger bag , which is impor tant if you want an oversize bag to double as a tote . TO BEGIN : Rather than give you a specific recipe for a particular bag , I 'm going to explain the concept of a pouch bag . Then you can vary it as easily as a casserole ! This bag is done with the most basic single crochet stitch ? the one you probably learned as a child . If you never did , you can get the basic technique in Columbia . Minerva 's " Beginners Crochet " or " Learn to Crochet . " Begin by making the base : actually a solid circle or " doily . " Chain four stitches into the ring ( your first round ) . Then , in the second round , increase in every stitch ( 12 se ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 sc ) , then , in every third , fourth , etc . You have to keep adding stitches , as the circle is getting larger . Continue in this way until you get a circle the desired size of the base of your bag . When you reach this point , simply continue the single crochet stitches without in creasing at all . Because your doily ca n't expand " out , " it expands " up , " like a tube . Keep crocheting until the tube is almost as high as you want your finished bag to be . AT THIS POINT . make a row of double crochet mesh . Work one double crochet , chain one and skip one stitch , continuing in this way until you get a fillet " mesh . " This is where your drawstring will go . Top with a few more rows of single crochet and finish off with a decorative edging such as a shell stitch or picot edge . Then feed a cord or ribbons through the mesh , draw them up , and voila ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or Main Street ? and welcome spring ! Q ? I want to do a needlepoint with a Japanese theme . My question is , how can I achieve that misty , foggy background of trees that this project portrays ? A ? Study Japanese paintings . Very often , white clouds of fog are painted in a clear-cut manner against a gold background , and figures and landscapes are silhouetted dramatically behind them . For a soft , misty effect you could start dark at the bottom , mixing two threads of close color together in the needle , getting lighter as you go upwards . This will give subtle shading . You should experiment on an odd scrap of canvas first to establish the correct coloring . Q ? Can you tell me how I can get a blueprint to make a quilting frame ? A ? I have included this in my book , " Quilts of America , " published by Oxmoor House . It is easy to make and can be combined with the stretcher strips you can buy inexpensively from an art store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library ; but keep reading ? I will include detailed instructions soon in a column . Q ? When I took my framed needlepoint down from the wall , the glass broke . I put it back on the wall without glass , and now the lower right-hand side is buckling out . What can I do ? A ? If your picture was framed on stretcher strips , all you have to do is dampen your needlepoint with cold water and a sponge . The canvas will shrink within the stretcher edges and , when dry , will be perfectly flat . If the framer glued your work it is best to take the whole thing apartand remount it on the stretchers , following the procedure I 've just described .
