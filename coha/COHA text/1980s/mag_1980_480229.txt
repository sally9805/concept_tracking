SO FAR there have been only a handful of sexual harassment cases decided in the federal courts , and none has reached the Supreme Court . The typical case involves a young woman who is hired as an office worker and , after a few months during which she has become eligible for promotion to a secretarial position , is invited to lunch by her supervisor . He says he wants to discuss her fitness report and future prospects with the firm , and that this can best be done in a quiet setting . After a cocktail or two , he makes a sexual advance , indicating that her prospects would be materially enhanced were she to consent . Replying that she will " ne'er consent , " and , unlike Byron 's Julia , meaning it , she proceeds to file a complaint with higher management . After a cursory investigation , an embarrassed higher management decides to take no action , or arranges a transfer , or , in the extreme case , discharges her as a troublemaker . Rarely , if ever , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the sexual advances are more direct . A physical assault in the stockroom serves to demonstrate ( and is intended to demonstrate ) what the job will require of the female applicant ; it is a job description of sorts . Promises of promotion and salary increases are made behind a file cabinet by bosses with busy hands . Sometimes , quite apart from the man making it , the proposition is tempting , promising a position with " greater responsibilities " combined with an airline ticket to romantic places on company ( but not unaccompanied I business . And 14 there is even a case , and surely not a unique case , where a frustrated middle manager discharges his assistant because , though spurning his persistent advances , she readily submits to a co-worker 's . ( The co-worker happens to be the son of a vice-president of the firm . ) These various episodes tell a familiar story , one known to many men , most working women ( or so we are told ) , and to all movie-goers who have seen it told sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ( to go back in time a bit ) a Franchot Tone or George Brent makes a sophisticated pass at a Rosalind Russell or Claudette Colbert and in return gets a resounding slap on the face . But while most cases of sexual harassment do not end in what can fairly be described as tragedy , they are surely not suitable material for comedy and ought not to be treated as such . One well-known law professor maintains that sexual harassment of working women " has been one of the most pervasive but carefully ignored features of our national life . " For the failure to recognize this , and do something about it , a price is about to be paid : the sexual harassment of working women has now been declared a discriminatory and , therefore , unlawful employment practice under federal law , and the enforcement of that law has been made the business of one of Washington 's most zealous administrative agencies , the Equal ' Employment Opportunity Commission . In April of this year , the EEOC issued its Interim Guidelines on Sexual Harassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to the inconsistency and indecision that have characterized the courts ' handling of this issue . OMEONE UNFAMILIAR with recent developments in the so-called federal system might well wonder how local lechery is properly the business of the national government . What clause of the Con-stitution authorizes this sort of reg-ulation ? The answer is , if the compa-ny is one employing a minimum of fifteen persons , it is an " industry af-fecting commerce , " and , as such , is subject to federal regulation . After all , the Constitution expressly authorizes Congress to regulate commerce among the states , and only a slight rearrange-ment of the terms is required to show how the power of Congress to reg-ulate commerce implies the use of the commerce power to regulate acts of Congress , at least those that would be consummated in a commercial setting . Furthermore , as these things are seen from Washington , almost every setting is commercial and subject to federal regulation , including private schools and colleges . As I was told by one EEOC official ( who found it amus-ing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry affecting interstate commerce because it buys a lot of equip-ment outside Connecticut . It also gath-ers " raw material " from around the country and the world , then works on that material for a term of years , and finally sends it ? reprocessed , one might say ? to a national and world market . Who is to say that this does not make it a commercial enterprise ? Certainly not the prestigious universities ; they find it more convenient to appoint vice-presidents for compliance than to take the government to court . Thus , some of the cases under investigation by the EEOC involve allegedly lecherous professors and their female students who , in exchange for sexual favors , are promised high grades and other marks of preferment . ( Yale has already been hauled into federal court on sexual harassment charges . ) This , it is explained in the literature , is a widespread practice , although in my experience , which may be parochial or atypical , the literature has got it backwards . Professor Berns , is n't there something I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of the EEOC 's jurisdiction over sexual harassment is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . When the bill that became this law reached the floor of the House of Representatives , the pertinent section read as follows : " It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual , or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation . terms , conditions , or privileges of employment , because of such individual 's race , color , religion , or national origin . " Nothing was said about sex . It was courtly Howard Smith of Virginia ? " Judge " Smith as he was known during his many years as chairman of the House Rules Committee ? who introduced the amendment to insert the word sex after the word religion . No champion of the rights of man , let alone women , Smith obviously thought that by adding this provision he would kill the legislation . Of course , he insisted he was serious in his professed concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letter asking Congress to do something ? what , she did not say ? about the some 2.661,000 more women than men living in the United States making it difficult , if not impossible , for " every female to have a husband of her own . " But his colleagues were not deceived by this bit of persiflage . Edith Green of Oregon , a staunch proponent of women 's rights , opposed the amendment precisely because she feared it would " jeopardize our primary purpose , " which was to do something about racial discrimination . Despite her efforts , however , the amendment was adopted ; and despite its adoption , the bill became law , and the EEOC was launched . Still , one would have thought ( and I have no doubt that , had they been asked , the members of the 88th Congress would have thought ) that sexual discrimination is one thing and sexual harassment quite another . When a firm pays a man more than it pays a woman doing comparable work , that is discrimination on the basis of sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly men fsay , doctors ) . more than it pays another class of workers , mostly women t say , nurses ) , doing ( ( comparable " work , that is , or might in time prove to be , discrimination on the basis of sex . ( The EEOC is vigorously pursuing this business of comparable work . ) But are women as a class being treated unequally when some , but not all , of them are being propositioned with a promise of a pay raise ? In what sense , then , is the sexual harassment of a woman a form of discrimination against women ? To refuse to hire a black person simply because he is black is surely discrimination against a class of persons and , as much , is surely forbidden by the statute . To refuse to hire or to pay lower wages to a woman simply because she is a woman is discrimination against a class of persons and , just as clearly as in the first case . is surely forbidden by the statute . But , to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some ? but surely not of all ? ? women is a form of discrimination against women as women ? T HE EEOC 'S answer to this simpleminded objection was best expressed in a 1977 federal court case . What is a violation of Title VII , said the court , is not that the supervisor demanded sex but that it be made a condition " he would not have fastened on a male employee . " But surely that depends on the sexual proclivities of the supervisor ? Some may prefer women , but others may prefer men . Are they all guilty of discrimination ? Two years earlier , a different federal court made this point when it said that it would be " ludicrous to hold that the sort of activity involved here was contemplated by the Civil Rights Act because to do so would mean that if the conduct complained of was directed equally to males there would be no basis for suit . " And it is no answer to this to say that , while possible . it is highly unlikely that an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favors of a female stenographer and the next day of a male mailroom clerk . Are there no female office managers ? Besides , it is not the office manager who commits this form of sexual harassment , not the office manager as an individual male or female ; it is the company in whose name he or she offers the job , promotion , or salary increase . He or she might be sued as an individual in a state court ? in some jurisdictions sexual harassment is treated as assault or battery , for example ? but only Bausch and Lomb , or the Bank of America , or the Public Service Electric and Gas Company may be sued for sexual harassment in a federal court ; and it is not easy to understand how the Bank of America can be said to be discriminating on the basis of sex if some of its branch managers proposition female tellers and others proposition male tellers . In terms of discrimination , I would have thought such a company could claim to have an exemplary record . Be that as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " it is much too late in the day to contend that Title VII does not outlaw terms of employment for women which differ appreciably from those set for men " ; so said a federal judge in 1977 . What he seems to have meant is that , typically , it is the man who supervises , the man who makes the sexual advance , and the woman , not the man , who is asked to do more than ought to be required of an employee . Under current social conditions . as Catherine A. MacKinnon argues in Sexual Harassment of Working W omen , " no man would be in the same position as a woman , even if he were in identical circumstances . " Which is to say , no man would be in the same position as a woman , even if he were in the same position as a woman . Logically and biologically , says MacKinnon , it might be reasonable to equate the sexual harassment of men and the sexual harassment of women , but in this society , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enacted in order to ensure women their rights , it is not reasonable . This is the theory on which the EEOC is proceeding . From all that appears in the " Interim Guidelines , " women as well as men can harass and men as well as women can be the victims of harassment . This regulatory neutrality conforms to the Constitution as well as to the various provisions of the Civil Rights Act , which are both gender blind and color blind . But so Iont. , as American so- ciety remains sexist , as well as racist , or so long as women , as well as blacks , are victims of past discrimination , the commission 's efforts will he extended mainly if not exclusively on their behalf . Thus , it is the female worker who is being invited ? indeed , encouraged ? to file complaints of harassment with the commission , and it is on her behalf that the commission . after investigating the complaints , will either file suit in the federal courts or issue , to the complainant , a Notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the guidelines do not contain a definition or description of sexual harassment . We are told that it may be " either physical or verbal in nature , " but there is not a clue as to what sort of act or what sort of language will be held to constitute the offense . This , said the EEOC , will be done " on a case by case basis , " and American employers will have to wait on these events . One thing , however , is made very clear : whatever the offense proves to be , the employer will be held responsible for it ? " regardless of whether the specific acts complained of were authorized or even forbidden by the employer and regardless of whether the employer knew or should have known of their occurrence " ; so say the guidelines . Nothing will be gained by the employer showing that the supervisor lacked authority to make the offer of preferment or was , in fact , violating company policy when he made it ; or even that the sexual advance was made away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state this in terms familiar to lawyers who remember their tort law on vicarious liability ? there is no recognition of the practice of employ . ees , or servants , or agents , to go off on a " frolic and detour " of their own. * By deciding to impose strict liability on the employer , the EEOC hopes to influence the federal courts , which have been divided on the issue . It is easier to see where the employer 's responsibility begins than where it will end . In the cases now being collected and processed by the commission , the supervisor 's advances were spurned and his conditions rejected . But it does not always work this way . What is the commission going to do when the proposition is accepted and , the supervisor being a man of his word , the compliant woman is hired , promoted , or given a salary increase denied to others ? Will an " honest madam , " in Shakespeare 's phrase , be entitled to bring an action against the employer ? Could it not be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or . at least , is denying herself ) an equal employment opportunity ? And what sort of an investigation would be required to determine whether she has a justified complaint ? ( In the case coming closest to this situation , the woman did her part by yielding , but the supervisor reneged , and not only reneged but promoted another woman , and the first woman sued . Can she recover damages from the company ? Can she recover if it can be proved that the second woman also yielded ? ) And what about the compliant woman 's male co-worker ? Since the typical supervisor is male and , for the time being at least , not homosexual , can it not be said that this male co- * " It is not contested that the defendant was possessed of a cart and horse , or that plaintiff was proceeding on foot across a certain public and common highway , to wit , Bishopsgate Street , or that he was struck by said horse and cart which was coming from the direction of Shoreditch and was being driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , as a consequence , that plaintiff suffered a fracture of the leg , causing him pain and great expense , and additional expense in having to retain diverse persons to superintend his business for six calendar months ; but , nevertheless , if the servant , instead of being on his master 's business at the time and acting against his master 's implied commands , was going on a frolic of his own , then the master is not liable . " w .... ? ? ? ? 1111N , r worker is being denied an equal employment opportunity ? Catherine MacKinnon thinks he might have a case . Whatever his other qualifications , he obviously has less to offer the lecherous supervisor , and simple justice would suggest that he be entitled to maintain an action under Title VII . Of course , he will have to show that the woman was promoted because she yielded to the sexual advance , and he will have to prove that she did in fact yield . Collecting these statistics will be burdensome , difficult . and expensive , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the others , the EEOC will have to rely on traditional investigative techniques , here applied to what at least some of the persons involved regard as their private lives . M ORE DISQUIETING still are suggestions in the guidelines , which EEOC officials do not hesitate to confirm , that employers now have " an affirmative duty to maintain a workplace free of sexual harassment and intimidation . " To squeeze these juices out of the already crumpled pulp of Title VII , the commission has to argue that it is an unlawful employment practice to fail to prevent such things as sexual banter in the work place . What is here declared to be an unlawful employment practice is the failure to provide a working environment " uncontaminated " by sexual harassment . Thus , a statute forbidding discrimination with respect to the " conditions " of employment ? which would seem to mean that , just as an employer may not discriminate with respect to " compensation " ( by paying women less than men ) , or with respect to " terms . ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 or with respect to " privileges " of employment ( by denying them holidays or rest periods given to men ) , so it may not discriminate with respect to conditions of employment ( by demanding more of women by way of qualifications or output than it demands of men ) ? this statute is now being interpreted to require employers to provide working conditions that meet the commission 's idea of an environment free of what it calls intimidation . From this reading of the statute , an employer discriminates when he intimidates , and he intimidates when he fails to cleanse the office or shop floor of polluting talk , or pictures , or whatever . ( This too , will be worked out " on a case by case basis . " ) Enforcement of this provision will not be an easy task . The Playboy centerfolds that decorate walls in the warehouse or the " girlie " calendars hanging above the desk of the Parts Department foreman will . admittedly , present no evidentiary problem . They are readily visible and , upon complaint , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order has been obeyed . ( Whether such an order can survive constitutional challenge ? on freedom of expression grounds ? is something else again . ) But what about oral harassment , that is , talk , whistling , or vulgar noises ? And obscene gestures ? Here the commission will be dealing not with what was said by a supervisor to a subordinate ? which , because it was said in private , is difficult enough to ascertain ? but with what was said or done by one worker to another worker . Lewd whistling might pollute the atmosphere , but , depending on how it is received , it might not ; and the two cases will be difficult to distinguish . Fortunately , in these sexually polluted atmosphere cases , the commission will not hold employers strictly liable for the unappreciated ) acts , words , sounds . or gestures of their male employees ; they will be liable only if they fail to take " immediate and appropriate corrective action , " Employers will , of course , be grateful for this uncharacteristic display of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect them to cooperate eagerly with the teams of inspectors dispatched by its regional offices to determine whether the atmosphere has , in fact , been cleaned up . Nevertheless , employers will make a serious mistake if they think they need only be concerned with how their male employees behave . While I hesitate to say that by their dress women can themselves pollute a working environment , I do think they can be accessories before the fact of its pollution . As the commission has acknowledged , however grudgingly , women can be provocative ; and it would be unfair to admonish or , in the grave case , to discharge the whistling office boy while ignoring the nubile stenographer whose " daring d ? colletage " may have provoked his whistle . Rather than having to devote what will surely be thousands of hours investigating such cases , it might be preferable to impose dress codes on female employees . T HE MOST SERIOUS objection to this may be constitutional : if it is a constitutional right to express one 's hostility to the country by affixing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , contrary to board of education regulations , school children have a constitutional right to express themselves by wearing armbands. women may have a constitutional right to express themselves with clothing . Then , too , some women , and especially those who like men and look upon the workplace as a good place to meet and attract them , will resent being told what to wear at work and what not to wear ; and like the women of Iran , they are not likely to be mollified by the reassurance that it is all in a good cause . But their resentment will have to be weighed in the balance with the indications that men can be aroused by what women wear and , on occasion , can be provoked to do or say things they may later regret . As I was informed by officials in the EEOC 's Office of Policy Implementation , it was the commission 's recognition of this provocation problem that partly explains the absence in the guidelines of a precise description of what constitutes sexual harassment . Perhaps , then , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male in the office said or did but what the female said or did , including what she wore . They will be grossly unjust if they do not because , contrary to the assumption in sexual harassment literature , it is women , not men , who are ultimately responsible for what might be called the moral tone of any place where men and women are assembled , even , I think , the workplace . ( Tocqueville observed this of American women 150 years or so ago , and I think it is still true . ) In general , men will be what women want them to be . ( " Do you want to know men ? " asked Rousseau , " Study women . " ) An employer 's " affirmative duty to maintain a workplace free of sexual harassment " will require that he take account of the power women have over men . 011,111.1.1 . Mr " This is certain to cause employers all sorts of trouble , especially if they try to impose dress codes ; but here the EEOC can be of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical male employer , rather than engaging in a running battle with his female employees ( who will constantly remind him of the greater freedom allowed by other companies ) , will eagerly adopt and enforce them . Here , for the commission 's own guidance , is a modest proposal : Rule 2 ( Rule 1 will have to deal with slit skirts ) : " The nipples of the female breast ( see 45 Code of Federal Regulations 11.3a ) shall not he allowed to protrude so far as to be visible in outline through the dress , blouse , or sweater . " In a few years ? say , by 1984 ? we can expect the Federal Register to have many pages of such rules . 0 N MARCH 24 , 1978 , President Carter issued Executive Order 12044 , " Improving Governmental Regulation . " Its purpose was to ensure , to the extent possible , that regulations be simple and clear , that legislative goals be achieved effectively and efficiently , and that unnecessary burdens , on the economy as well as on individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major impact on the economy , or any part of it , their issuance must be accompanied by what is called a " regulatory analysis , " explaining the problems , the alternative approaches to dealing with it , and justifying the approach being taken . If , on the other hand , the agency determines that its regulations will not have a major impact on the economy , it is required officially to say so . This the EEOC did when , in the Federal Register , it published its " Interim Guidelines on Sexual Harassment . " I have no disposition to quarrel with this assessment ; adherence to the guidelines may impose some economic costs on industry , but these costs will probably be insignificant and , anyway , unlike the costs of putting " scrubbers " on the nation 's coal-burning furnaces , are probably incalculable . If enforced in the same zealous spirit that has sometimes characterized the commission 's work in the area of racial discrimination , however , the guidelines will certainly have an impact on the commercial environment and on the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impact other than , or in addition to , the one nominally sought by the commission . Their enforcement will take the national government into an area where it does not belong and require it to do things that ought not be done by a government founded on liberal principles . In our time , the government may fix prices , limit emissions , forbid effluents , bus children , set quotas , prescribe diets , and proscribe medicines , and some sort of case can be made for each of these regulatory policies . ( Rather the COWPS , EPA , OSHA , FDA , EEOC , FTC , and the rest than ? to take the extreme cases ? runaway inflation , unbreathable air , undrinkable water , explosive grain elevators , poisoned mothers and deformed babies , or morally corrupting television programs . ) But now this national government is threatening the essentially and necessarily private realm of the erotic . Of course , this will be denied by the commission . It will protest that its concern is the workplace , not the bedroom ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workplace . That its purpose is the prevention of sexual harassment , not the inhibiting of romance ; but in its efforts to identify the one . the commission will intrude upon the other . That it will not interfere with the easy and sometimes playful familiarity that characterizes the relations of men and women . That its simple goal is a workplace where men look upon women as equals and not as sex objects ; but even the man at work is aware that women are different and that the difference is sexual , and that to deny the difference is to destroy the relationship . That it will provide no congenial forum for the malicious and false accusation ; but men will accept that assurance only at their peril . That it will never use its power vindictively against firms or organizations that have the courage or temerity to oppose it but there are organizations ? a couple of little private and wholly privately funded colleges come to mind that can demonstrate the worthlessness of such assurances . That it is aware that women can provoke men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it will not admit that Rousseau was right when he said that women give the law in love because , " according to the order of nature , resistance belongs to them . " In the sexual harassment literature there is no such thing as romance ; there are only commercial or power relationships ? marriage , prostitution , or harassment ? in which women are required to exchange " sexual services for material survival . " And there is no such thing as nature . That , the feminists say , is the trouble with the law : it reinforces the pernicious and unscientific view that there is an essential difference between men and women , and it is this view that is responsible for sexual harassment . It encourages men to define women on the basis of their sexuality , while , according to nature , the differences between men and women are insignificant . One 's sexual identity is determined by social factors ? as MacKinnon puts it , the most salient determinents of sexuality " are organized in society , not fixed in nature ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws . Feminists complain about certain aspects of the criminal law and specifically that , while sexual harassment is technically a crime in most jurisdictions , the rules of procedure and evidence make it difficult to gain convictions . Juries are cautioned to be especially careful in their evaluation of testimony , to take account of the emotional involvement of witnesses , and the fact that the alleged offenses take place in private , thus making it difficult to determine the truth respecting them . As MacKinnon says , the law gives men a " right to be let alone " and makes of this a " shield behind which isolated women can be sexually abused one at a time . " But by respecting the privacy of the erotic relationship , the law gives men and women together the right to be let alone , and does this not in order to allow men to beat their wives or harass their secretaries with impunity ? although these may be seine of the consequences ? but to allow them to desire each other , enjoy each other , give pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each other . Thus , traditionally , love has been seen to be none of the government 's business .
