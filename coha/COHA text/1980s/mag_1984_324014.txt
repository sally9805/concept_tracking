Skou Tour : 1922-1984 <P> When Guinea was preparing for independence from France in 1958 , President Charles de Gaulle proposed that it join in a Franco-African community that was to maintain political and economic ties to France . The leaders of all twelve other former French colonies in Africa decided to participate , but not intense , eloquent Ahmed Skou Tour . Said he to De Gaulle : " We prefer poverty in liberty to riches in slavery . " <P> That single act , Tour would often say over the next quarter-century , was the proudest moment of his life . It also represented a high point for both Guinea and Tour , a son of a poor farmer who became the West African nation 's first and only ruler . When Tour died last week at 62 in a Cleveland hospital , to which he had been rushed for treatment of a worsening heart condition , he left behind a record of thoroughgoing repression , oppression and tyranny that began to abate only a few years ago . Lamented France 's Le Monde : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , it was the one that Skou Tour promised to his people 26 years ago . " <P> Tour grandly styled himself the Supreme Father of the Revolution . To Guineans , he was the " Big Elephant , " known for his broad shoulders and great stamina . Often his elephantine power was used to crush those he thought opposed him . In the 1970s , he ordered thousands of people arrested . By 1976 , according to Amnesty International , at least 2,900 citizens had " disappeared . " Many were sent to detention camps , where some prisoners were locked in cells that were too small to allow them to stand up or lie down and were put on the infamous " black diet , " completely deprived of food or water . Of Guinea 's nearly 6 million inhabitants , 2 million now live in exile in the Ivory Coast , Sierra Leone and other neighboring countries . <P> Economically , Guinea fared little better under Toure . Despite its vast resources of bauxite ( used to make aluminum ) , diamonds and iron , Guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is $290 , life expectancy is less than 40 years , and the infant mortality rate is tragically high . In the rundown capital of Conakry , there has been little new construction in 25 years . Businesses must provide their own services , even such basic ones as electricity and water . Malnourished children play listlessly in the streets . <P> Tour showed an affinity for independence at an early age . One of seven children , he was expelled from school at 15 for leading a protest against colonialism . After taking a job at Conakry 's post office , he found that his charm and speaking talent made him a natural leader in the developing labor movement . Endowed with limitless energy , he was a brilliant orator who could - and often did-hold audiences captive for hours . <P> His early successes led to his involvement in West African politics as well as to various local governmental posts . He became mayor of Conakry in 1955 , and was elected to a seat in the National Assembly in Paris one year later .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
