PIAF by Pam Gems <P> Affinity is the most potent magic the theater has to offer . When Jason Robards plays Eugene O'Neill or Julie Harris portrays Emily Dickinson , the evening is transfiguring - both radiantly illuminating and deeply moving . That is what is happening on the stage of Broadway 's Plymouth Theater , where Jane Lapotaire plays Edith Piaf as if she is being flayed alive and only the lacerated nerve ends glow in the dark like neon . <P> Lapotaire renders Piaf , the diminutive poet-songstress of the pre-dawn city blues , with matchless psychological fidelity . She gives us Piaf , whom the French called the Sparrow , as an eagle in courage . She makes us know Piaf soul-seared , the Paris gutter urchin , the cagey whore whom the world came to hold in the embrace of fame but who could not keep her own life from seeping through her splayed fingers , at 47 in 1963 spent by alcohol , morphine , sex and cancer . <P> Some people are bathed in a perverse glory , as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piaf was one of these , and Lapotaire never lets us forget it . The play unfolds through sketchy vignettes , some of which are disconcerting , such as the ones that have Marcel Cerdan , the French middleweight champion and Piaf 's love of loves , being played by a black , and a Marlene Dietrich who is downright frumpy . A medal of merit should be struck for Zo Wanamaker ; as the prostitute pal of Piaf 's who later achieves smug respectability , she is a perfect foil for Lapotaire , and their scenes together are wickedly droll . <P> - T.E .
