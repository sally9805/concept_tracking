" During the 1970s ' , " says Paul Simon , " we were not only competing against the memory of Simon and Garfunkel , but against each other . It was tense . We ' ve always been very competitive , and we obviously have very different musical tastes . But it ' s mellowed in the past few years , and I saw the Central Park concert as a chance to be positive toward each other , to be good guys , and if we were lucky , to be a popular success. " // The story of Mr. Simon and Mr. Garfunkel is a tale about a close , competitive friendship , and how it has influenced the music they ' ve produced , separately and together . It ' s about how two partners in a relationship that dates back to childhood chose to split up at the height of their success , spent the next 11 years pursuing their own musical interests at a wary distance , and found themselves unexpectedly drawn back together last September. // It was then that Mr. Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Central Park . A half million people showed up , and the experience proved so satisfying for them that it set the stage for further collaboration . A 90-minute cable television special based on the concert began playing on Home Box Office last week . A record album of the event is due for release this month . Mr. Simon and Mr. Garfunkel have set plans for a half-dozen concert dates together this spring in Europe and Japan . And if all goes well there , they ' ll return to do a concert tour of the United States , and then record a new album of original material. // When Mr. Simon and Mr. Garfunkel stopped singing together in 1970 , they were at the height of their popularity . " Bridge Over Troubled Water , " their sixth album of songs written by Mr. Simon , had just been released and was on its way to becoming one of the biggest selling records in pop-music history. // But even then , their interests were diverging . The differences were never articulated , and they never split formally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their last joint album . Mr. Simon , always the more experimental of the two , wanted to move beyond the confines of two voices and an acoustic guitar to explore other kinds of music . Mr. Garfunkel , who had begun an acting career in Mike Nichols ' s " Catch 22 " during the recording of " Bridge , " was also interested in expanding his vocal range . In tandem with Mr. Simon , he had been mostly limited to singing harmony , and he was eager to try recording his own versions of tunes by other songwriters. // Part of the subsequent tension in the relationship stemmed from Mr. Simon ' s belief that Mr. Garfunkel played it too safe musically - something Mr. Simon views less harshly today than he once did . " Obviously we have a different concept of what an album should be , " Mr. Simon says . " Artie works in a narrow range that he does extraordinarily well . He ' s more of a romantic than me . He likes ballads , as of course we know , tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t recognize the differences between his songs because he doesn ' t set them up . It ' s ballad , ballad , ballad. // Mr. Garfunkel has never offered apologies for his more limited interests , and his preference for lavishly romantic tunes from a small group of songwriters including Jimmy Webb and Stephen Bishop . " I ' ve never felt comfortable doing uptempo songs , " he explains . " People say ' Look at how many ballads he does . ' Well , ballads are my forte . It ' s the first tie theory . If you have two ties , and one ' s your favorite , why go out for a major occasion wearing your second favorite ? The artist Kenneth Noland painted stripes , in shades from deep purple to salmon . I ' m the same way musically . Others choose to work from a larger palette . My ear just doesn ' t enjoy the mix of delicate and bombastic. // Mr. Simon ' s apparently does . " Generally I like things rockier than Artie - not heavy metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes . Actually I ' ve experimented with a lot of sounds : Latin , gospel , reggae . I even had a Brazilian period . " Indeed , Mr. Simon has played with musicians including Urubamba , a South American band ; the Dixie Hummingbirds , a group of black women gospel singers ; and the famed session musicians from Muscle Shoals , Alabama , who play something Mr. Simon characterizes as white rhythm and blues. // These contrasting musical preferences are also mirrored in their personal styles . Mr. Garfunkel ' s is more contained and linear , befitting someone who was trained in math and architecture ; Mr. Simon ' s is more eclectic and unpredictable . " Paul typically says something like ' I think it ' s time to change my friendships and then does , ' says Mr. Garfunkel . " I find that interesting . Or he ' ll decide every five years or so that his apartment needs a whole different look and change it . It ' s a sense of new era for new era ' s sake. " // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical paths through the 1970 ' s , both managed to sharpen their craft and achieve new kinds of recognition . Mr. Garfunkel , long regarded by critics as the less creative of the two , emerged as an original , interpretive singer . " Mr. Garfunkel has become a compelling song stylist and an understated but remarkably musical vocal technician , " Robert Palmer wrote in The Times after Mr. Garfunkel ' s last concert at Carnegie Hall . " He has the rare ability to put a song over with a maximum of feeling , a minimum of fuss and an admirable control of pitch , timbre and phrasing. " // Mr. Simon evolved not only into ! more sophisticated and resourceful songwriter with compositions such as " Late in the Evening , " " Kodachrome " and " My Little Town , " but also as a solo performer who could bring considerable energy and feeling to his best songs . Following his release of the album " Still Crazy After All These Years " in 1975 , Mr. Simon was awarded a Grammy as the year ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were each able to build substantial followings in the 1970 ' s , neither one was ever as successful as the two had been together - a fact neither of them were above joking about . When Mr. Simon asked Mr. Garfunkel to join him on a television special in 1977 , the comedy show was built around just that theme . In one sketch , co-written by Mr. Simon , Charles Grodin , playing the role of director , calls the two partners over following a rendition of " Old Friends . " " The sound of you and Artie singing together is so much better than the sound of either one of you singing alone , " Mr. Grodin tells them , blithely oblivious to the hurt he might be inflicting , " that whatever petty differences you might have had in the past , I strongly urge you to take a long hard look at them. " // In fact , the two performers continued intermittently to sing together during the 1970 ' s , although never in a full-scale concert . In 1972 , they performed briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid-70 ' s , Mr. Garfunkel showed up on stage at the end of Mr. Simon ' s concerts , to sing a few songs with him . Twice they even recorded songs together - " My Little Town , " Mr. Simon ' s tune about their childhood in Forest Hills and a new version of the 1959 hit " What a Wonderful World , " which they sang with James Taylor. // Several factors prompted the Central Park concert together last fall . On the one hand , the competitive tensions that permeated the Simon and Garfunkel relationship through the 1970 ' s began to dissipate as their individual musical identities grew stronger . Perhaps too , they were more open to a collaboration because each one had suffered a recent and unaccustomed professional disappointment : Mr. Simon over the negative critical and commercial reaction to " One Trick Pony , " the film he had spent more than three years writing , scoring and starring in ; Mr. Garfunkel by virtue of the tepid sales of his most recent album , " Scissors Cut , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in Nicholas Roeg ' s 1980 film , " Bad Timing - A Sensual Obsession. " // Mr. Garfunkel ' s receptivity to a reunion was also influenced by a personal tragedy . In 1979 , Laurie Bird , the actress with whom he had been living for several years , committed suicide . " I lost the center of my life when I lost Laurie , " he says . " After that I was a bachelor again , and that made me more predisposed toward old friends , and one in particular . " Finally , there was the simple fact that both Mr. Simon and Mr. Garfunkel were between projects when the Central Park concert offer arose. // Originally , Mr. Simon was asked by promoter Ron Delsener to do the concert alone , and when Mr. Simon first called Mr. Garfunkel , it was to ask whether he might want to join him for a few songs at the end of the concert . " Then I thought , " said Mr. Simon , ' Oh boy , I ' m going to be the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do that . ' " Instead , they agreed to do the whole concert together , but almost immediately a familiar tension set in . Mr. Simon wanted to use a backup band . Mr. Garfunkel did not. // " It was going to be a very big outdoor show , and I couldn ' t imagine one guitar putting out enough for 200 , 000 or 300 , 000 people , " Mr. Simon explained . " Besides , I love working with a band . I love it when it starts rocking. " // Mr. Garfunkel , characteristically , was more conservative . " I just felt that the more variables you control in an open air show , the better . I thought we ' d be safer if we put all our eggs in three baskets - my voice , Paul ' s voice and Paul ' s guitar. " // Rehearsals were tense - in part because Mr. Garfunkel had never before tried harmonizing on some of the uptempo tunes from Mr. Simon ' s solo period , or singing in front of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Artie , the band will jell , and when it does , you ' ll want to sing . You ' ll like it . ' " Indeed , Mr. Garfunkel found that in concert , despite a feeling of tenativeness , he was comfortable singing even Mr. Simon ' s rockier tunes. // Coincidentally , both Mr. Simon and Mr. Garfunkel also turned 40 last fall . If that seems like an advanced age to be performing pop music for an audience largely composed of teen-agers , each of them seemed to have come to terms with the dilemma. // " People ask , ' Can you do this forever ? ' " says Mr. Garfunkel , " and I say that depends on what ' this ' means . Once ' this ' was candy-coated , danceable and sexy . Now I ' m interested in working in an idiom that ' s a little more complex , but not so complex that you don ' t reach people. " // Mr. Simon finds himself , at 40 , in an unusually positive frame of mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this field , " he says . " You produce good work and it has an impact . You may sell less records as you get older , but so what ? Frank Sinatra doesn ' t often sell a lot of records , but he ' s a very significant force among a certain group of people . He ' s not Metternich , but people listen . I ' ve thought about this since John Lennon died . It ' s funny , because I ' m not one who thought he was doing great work , but I was surprised at how moved everyone was by his death , including me . For me it was because he was still going out and trying things , and it ' s tough to make music for 20 years. // Neither Mr. Simon nor Mr. Garfunkel listens to much current pop music , however . Mr. Garfunkel leans more to Bach , and to favorite 1960 ' s performers such as Joni Mitchell , the Beatles , the Beach Boys and James Taylor . Mr. Simon listens to a smattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heads and Philip Glass , but he , too , has a preference for the pop music of the 1960 ' s. // And now Simon and Garfunkel , one of that decade ' s most popular groups , are going to try making music together again . Mr. Simon is interested in writing the sort of ballads he avoided for so long as a solo performer . Mr. Garfunkel is more receptive to singing Mr. Simon ' s uptempo tunes , and playing in front of a band . Both of them would like to recapture the best feelings of the past , but neither one is willing to settle for that . " There ' s a Ricky Nelson tune that expresses it best for me , " says Mr. Garfunkel . " It ' s got a line that goes , ' If memories is all I played , I ' d rather drive a truck .
