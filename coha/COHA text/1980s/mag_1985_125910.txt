The continuum of rutted quagmire that passed for the course at last Saturday 's TAC national cross-country championships in Raleigh , N.C. , would have been better suited to tug-of-war or mud wrestling . But cross-country runners always play it as it lies , and few seem to revel in the elemental challenge as much as Pat Porter and Lynn Jennings , who won the men 's and women 's races , respectively , going away . // Porter 's training regimen around his home in Alamosa , Colo. ranges from rarified runs along mountain trails at elevations up to 10,000 feet to quadricepburning slogs through the sands around Great Dunes National Monument . Jennings prefers the fecund forests that surround her home in Durham , N.H. In the woods there , she says , she achieves a running nirvana by becoming " one with the mud . " // Both Porter and Jennings won in the mud Saturday by seemingly skimming over the ankle-deep puddles and rain-drenched rolling hills of Meredith College with remarkably similar wire-to-wire dominance . This was Porter 's fourth consecutive TAC victory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven consecutive national championships won by Indiana 's legendary Don Lash from 1934 to 1940 . More immediately , it marks Porter as America 's best hope to break European and African dominance at the world cross-country championships in March in Neuch ? tel , Switzerland . His previous best finish in the world championships was fourth in 1984 . " He could win it , and he will definitely win it before his career is over , " said Bob Sevene , coach of Athletics West , Porter 's club . " Pat is only going to get better . " // Jennings 's win in the women 's 5,000-meter race was the latest and most decisive step in a yearlong comeback . She set five personal bests last summer and is now fulfilling the promise she showed when she won the TAC junior cross-country championship in 1977 at the age of 17 . After that , she had slowed her training to concentrate on-earning a degree at Princeton . People said she was burned out from too much , too soon , but she says she was just hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , " said Lesley Welch , the second-place finisher. // Porter , 26 , and Jennings , 25 , are prime examples of a new breed of American distance runners : They avoid the perils of overracing in rich road competitions and focus on cross-country as the basis for all-around running excellence and longevity . " It 's what the Europeans have been doing for years , " said Joe Vigil , Porter 's trainer and the coach at small-college distance-running power Adams ( Colo . ) State . " It 's going to lengthen careers and enhance performance . " // And if the NCAA championships five days before the TAC were any indication , America 's distance-running talent is getting deeper . The University of Wisconsin took both the men 's and women 's team titles  --  a first for the NCAA  --  both with homegrown athletes . On a snow-covered golf course in suburban Milwaukee , Badger senior Tim Hacker exhibited his miler 's speed in winning the men 's 10,000 in 29:17.8 . In the 5,000-meter women 's race , the aptly named Suzie Tuffey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16:22.5 . The NCAAs ended in tragedy . A small plane carrying members of the Iowa State women 's team , the second-place finisher , back to Ames crashed in an ice storm in Des Moines . All seven people on board were killed , including coach Ron Renko , his assistant , Pat Moynihan , and three runners . // When Porter arrived for the TAC , he had n't raced since October , when he finished second to Ethiopia 's Wodajo Bulti in the IAAF World Cup 10,000 meters in Australia . He felt well rested and confident and was quoted as saying there was " no way " anyone would beat him in Raleigh . // Porter 's style is pure guts  --  get out front early and stay there . Before the race , which was held in 40 ? cold and a light rain before a few hundred kindred spirits , Porter 's chief rivals , Bruce Bickford and Ed Eyestone , decided to collaborate on strategy . " We basically knew Pat was going to go out and hammer it , " said Eyestone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Bick and I decided we 'd get behind him , push each other and try to run him down . " // Even though the first 400 meters of the course were likened by Eyestone to a rice paddy , Porter emerged from a pack of 360 runners and going into the first uphill turn took a slight lead over the two conspirators . But Porter had no intention of cooperating with their plans . He immediately stretched his 6-foot , 135-pound frame into a quarter-miler 's stride and opened a 25-yard lead . // " Pat just put it into overdrive , " said Eyestone , who had faded to fifth the year before after trying to stay with Porter . " I thought , ' No way he can keep that up under these conditions . ' So I went to Plan B  --  maybe try to reel him in later . I did n't do much reeling . " // Instead , Porter had the field reeling . " I do n't come back , " he explained later , with some satisfaction . With 3,000 meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared by Vigil , who was watching from an archery field , Porter gave him the thumbs-up sign . // " Ed and I were doing quite a bit of talking , trying to encourage each other , " said Bickford , the reigning TAC 10,000-meter champion . " But Pat was just too strong . Finally , I just said to Ed , ' How the hell does the guy do it ? ' " // Well , there was always the chance he would fall , which he did with only 800 meters to go . // " My face went right in the mud  --  squish " a laughing Porter said after the race as he scraped caked mud off himself with paper towels . " But I had so much adrenaline , I just popped right up . I still could n't see anybody . " // Porter finished in 30:33.1 . Bickford was 120 meters and 21.3 seconds back . Eyestone was third , and Hacker , in a bid for the first men 's national cross-country double in 25 years , finished fourth . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1982 NCAA and TAC champion , separated themselves from the field early . The two are friends , Jennings having recently written a feature story about Welch for Boston Running News . // Friendship or not , Jennings broke away to a 20-meter lead over Welch at the 2,000-meter mark and finished more than 140 meters ahead in 17:27.9 . Christine McMiken was third , and 1983 champion Betty Springs fourth . // " The footing was atrocious  --  I loved it , " said Jennings , who is also good friends with Porter . While they traveled together on the European summer circuit , Jennings promised to knit Porter a sweater of Icelandic wool if he won in Raleigh . " I learned a lot about keeping cool from Pat , " said Jennings . " He 's been a great help , so now all he has to do is pick out his colors. " // Had Porter 's influence included imparting his philosophy of running ? " No , Lynn 's just gutsy , " he said . " I think she knew that she was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are , everybody is waiting for you to make your move . She did , and that was it . " // That was it for you , too , Pat .
