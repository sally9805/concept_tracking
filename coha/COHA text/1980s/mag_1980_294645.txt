LOOK BACK IN ANGER by John Osborne <P> The voice of Osborne is the voice of Thersites . He rails against the world around him , which he abominates as degraded and contemptible . The rhetorical force of his tirades provides the driving tempo of his plays . What is fascinating about his most potent dramas-Look Back in Anger , Inadmissible Evidence , The Entertainer-is that the hero whiplashes not only the world but also himself . <P> Without his self-lacerating venom , Jimmy Porter ( Malcolm McDowell ) would be an intolerable bully . As it is , he humiliates his upper-class wife Alison ( Lisa Banes ) , who hides behind a stiff upper lip and an ironing board . He hectors his live-in friend Cliff ( Raymond Hardie ) , with whom he has some sort of male-bonding kinship . And he browbeats his actress mistress Helena ( Fran Brill ) , who moves in when Alison leaves . <P> When Look Back in Anger opened in 1956 it was greeted as a fusillade against British social inertia .

" To day , two other lines that begin and end this speech are more striking : " Why , why , why , why do we let these women bleed us to death ? . . . No , there 's nothing left for it , me boy , but to let yourself be butchered by the women . " In 1980 Anger seems most like a battle royal of the sexes . <P> This admirable revival at off-Broadway 's Roundabout Theater honors all concerned . Malcolm McDowell stalks the boards with the frustrated fury of a caged lion . There is a poignant dignity in Banes ' Alison , a fever in the loins of Brill 's Helena , and Hardie 's Cliff is the sort of buddy you would want in the front lines . - T.E.K.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
