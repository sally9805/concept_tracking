High court plugs a leak-and gets a flood of criticism <P> Frank W. Snepp III was one of the last Americans to be evacuated by helicopter from the roof of the U.S. embassy in Saigon in the frantic hours before the city 's fall on April 30 , 1975 . Snepp , then 31 and a senior analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency , with 4 years experience in Viet Nam , thought the agency 's withdrawal planning had been shockingly inept , particularly in that hundreds of local CIA collaborators were simply left behind to meet whatever fate awaited them . After he returned to Washington , where he was awarded the agency 's Medal of Merit , he quit to write Decent Interval , a critical account of the CIA 's performance during South Viet Nam 's final days , published in 1977 . <P> But in making the switch from agent to tattletale author , Snepp made a mistake : he ignored the written pledge that CIA employees make never to publish " any information " about the organization without submitting it for prior review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court slammed Snepp hard for his transgression . By a 6-3 vote , the court ruled that the CIA secrecy pledge is very much a legally enforceable contract . In their terse nine-page opinion , Chief Justice Warren Burger and the other five men in the majority noted that Snepp had " deliberately " violated his " obligation " to his former employer , and that the Government was well within its rights to sue him for breach of contract . Moreover , said the majority , a lower court had acted perfectly properly in ordering Snepp to " disgorge the benefits of his faithlessness . " That meant Snepp had to turn over all of the money he had made ( $115,000 so far ) from Decent Interval . <P> Snepp , the son of a North Carolina state judge , had signed two secrecy agreements during his eight years with the CIA . But when the CIA demanded to see his manuscript , Snepp refused . He maintained that he was obliged to submit only classified or nonpublic information . And his book , he insisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , which has been troubled by the spy-and-tell books of another former agent , Philip Agee , decided to take Snepp to court to show that the secrecy pledge was not to be trifled with . <P> In 1978 a federal district court judge in Virginia , Oren Lewis , granted an injunction barring Snepp from writing anything else about the CIA without clearance ; Lewis also ordered Snepp to forfeit his " illgotten gains " from Decent Interval . Last year an appeals court was only slightly more sympathetic to Snepp 's pleas . It upheld the injunction and gave its blessing to some form of financial penalty-but not to confiscation of Snepp 's earnings . Still not satisfied , Snepp decided to appeal to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the prior-clearance requirement impinged on his First Amendment right of free speech . <P> In its decision last week , however , the majority chose to decide the case as a question of contractual obligations and rejected Snepp 's First Amendment argument . The court said that the CIA had a need to impose " reasonable restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to the effective operation of our foreign intelligence service . "
