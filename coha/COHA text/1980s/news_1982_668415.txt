SANTA BARBARA , Calif. - President Ronald Reagan keeps being drawn to show business as surely as old athletes drift back to dreams about their glory days . On this latest trip out West , Reagan made his first stop at the University of Nevada in Reno , famous for having served as the setting for a number of movies . The school ' s press release for the visit dealt solely with its history as a movie prop , and one alumnus described the campus as a Nevada version of Schwab ' s Drug Store . He said students once flocked there in hopes of being " discovered " while serving as extras in such opuses as Clifton Webb ' s " Mr. Belvedere Goes To College . " While in Nevada , Reagan also attended a Republican fund-raiser at the garish Las Vegas home of entertainer Wayne Newton . Rich Garoslovsky of the Wall Street Journal described the scene in his pool report for the rest of the White House press corps who were kept away from the event : " Wayne was there to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair glistened in the sunshine ; he sported a tan Sonny Bono would kill for . He was wearing a dark suit ; no gold chains were evident . " National security adviser Wiliam Clark , who was allowed inside , reported that Newton had some " arrogant-looking swans " on the grounds of the estate . The flight into Las Vegas joined the list of all-time " white knuckle " specials . As the United 727 press charter swooped toward the airport , shivering in turbulence , it suddenly shot skyward again , then angled sharply and made a steep descent , pitching left and then right in desert winds of nearly 40 mph . The pilot explained afterward that a single-engine plane landing in front of the charter had crashed , forcing him to abort his landing . Faced with a choice from the traffic control tower of circling until the small plane could be cleared from the runway or diverting quickly to another runway , the pilot chose the latter approach . The small plane , it was later learned , was pitched on its nose by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s handlers keep him as far from the press as possible , especially on his vacation trips when he is sequestered at his ranch in the mountains about 20 miles from here , while the press is kept at a beach-front hotel . Knowing Reagan would be virtually incommunicado for the next few days , the press pool on Air Force One Friday afternoon devised a way to get presidential recognition . As Reagan disembarked at Point Magu Naval Air Station near here to begin the last leg of his trip to the ranch , the handful of reporters shouted in unison , like a football cheer , " Solidarity ! " Reagan , who heard the noise over the drone of the plane , turned and cupped his ears . " What ? " he asked . " 1-2-3 , " the countdown began again . " Solidarity ! " " What ? " The reporters tried another word : " Poland ! " It elicited a newsworthy responce . " I think it ' s horrible , " Reagan said of the government ' s move against the Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject during his regular weekend radio broadcast . The White House staff and press corp have been fighting a running battle with the management of the Sheraton Santa Barbara , which serves as headquarters when Reagan is at the ranch . On previous visits , reporters have been charged as much as $145 a day for a room rented to a regular tourist for $79 . White House officials have been negotiating for a better deal . This time , a two-page letter from the hotel proprietor , Buddy Taub , greeted each reporter . " I sincerely regret the apparent lack of communication afforded our hotel regarding our rate structure , " it began . He claimed that when the White House first discussed rates he took into consideration " free use of the press room . " In fact , White House officials say he charged $800 a day for the shabby function room that serves as a press room . Taub also claimed " loss of business which we never anticipated would exceed $250,000 yearly . . . " At any rate , he has finally reduced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wrote in an article in this month ' s Washington Journalism Review that the hotel had " Moorish architecture and boorish managment , " he was exiled this trip to the hotel " annex " a couple of blocks away , the first White House reporter to be assigned to the Sheraton ' s Siberia .
