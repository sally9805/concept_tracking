The bewildering array of new ways to finance buying a home <P> " I made the last payment on the house I today , " cries Willy Loman 's widow at the conclusion of Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman . " We 're free and clear . " Many Americans still consider owning a home a virtual birthright , as well as a necessary inflation hedge . But today people are being forced to find ingenious and complex schemes to beat the high cost of achieving Loman 's dream . <P> Mortgage rates in many areas have now surged to 16% or higher , and last week 's tightening of credit will undoubtedly push them up farther . Although housing prices actually declined during the past three months , the cost of a home is still at levels that would have been considered exorbitant just a few years ago . The median price of a home in March was $66,700 , up 7% in the past twelve months . In 1971 the average price of a new house was $25,200 . <P> Today 's high cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old-fashioned as Willy Loman 's Studebaker . Virtually all banks in California stopped making such loans last fall . Hundreds of thousands of would-be buyers now simply can not afford the big down payment or steep monthly charges involved in those loans . Herman J. Smith , president of the National Association of Home Builders , says that only about 4% of first-time home buyers can qualify for a 15% mortgage on a median-priced house . Therefore , people are turning to so-called creative home financing . <P> One solution has been for sellers to lend money to the buyers at a more affordable 11% or 12% . That cuts down on an owner 's profit , but at least makes it possible to sell property in today 's sluggish market . The National Association of Realtors estimates that half of home sales now involve some sort of seller financing . <P> Such deals , though , take business away from savings and loans or other lending institutions . Thus they are searching for ways to provide affordable mortgages , while still making a profit . Last month the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to issue variable-rate loans with interest charges that rise and fall with prevailing rates . The cost of the mortgage could be adjusted as often as each month according to an agreed-upon index , such as the yield on U.S. Treasury bills . Under this plan , a mortgage signed today at 15% might increase to 18% in a year or so , if interest rates continue to rise . <P> Lenders like the new mortgages because they do not have to worry about the loans becoming unprofitable . Many financial institutions today still have mortgages on their books at 6% interest , at a time when they are paying 17% or more to depositors . But the variable rate loans are unpopular with borrowers because of the uncertainty over the level of monthly charges . The payment on a $60,000 30-year mortgage at 9% is $483 , but that same loan at 15% would be $758.
