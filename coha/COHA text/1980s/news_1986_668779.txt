Q-This letter is in regard to the outlandish and decrepit condition of the billiard table in our clubhouse . The cloth on the table is worn and torn and has not been replaced for more than nine months . Because our board of directors will not act , I feel that the holder of the 40-year recreation lease on the clubhouse should either make the repairs himself or force the board to . What do you think ? A-You are right . It is the responsibility of the board of directors to keep clubhouse equipment in good repair . I am not privy to the terms in your recreation lease , but it probably states that maintaining the facility and its personal property is the responsibility of the association . The lease holder could force the association to better maintain the property , but it is not likely to happen over a ripped pool table cover . Q-Our association is in big trouble . It is less than 2 years old and already several members are quite delinquent in making their assessment payments . The board has advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that doesn ' t solve our problem , since we could only collect when the units are sold . How can we force these owners to pay their share ? A-Your board is doing the right thing . By filing the liens , they are securing the apartments as a guarantee against permanent non-payment . In the meantime , the board may have to increase all member ' s assessments to generate enough revenue to run the condo until the attorneys can be successful with their foreclosure suits against the delinquents . It could take a year or more . I have no magic answer for you . If personal meetings with the non-payers have had no effect , and the same is true with contacts from the attorneys , about all you can do is report their credit record to their mortgagor and the credit bureau and hope they would like to clear their records . Problems of this type can be kept to a minimum by tightening up your unit-selling procedures . Be sure prospects can afford to live in your complex . Pre-purchase interviews should emphasize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q-Is there available data on what the maintenance charges should be for small condominium shopping centers ? We have built a 24-unit small business center and do not have a budget to go by . A-The best publication that I can find is " Commercial Condominiums , " by F. Scott Jackson and James Laughlin and published by the Community Associations Institute , 1423 Powhattan St. , Alexandria , Va. 22314 . It has 474 pages and costs $41. 50 . Q-We have a situation where two members of our board of directors place bowls of cat food daily under a tree in our parking lot to attract hungry cats . Do we have any recourse to stop this practice ? A-About the time I am ready to say there is nothing about condominiums I have not heard , someone sends me a letter about a directors ' brunch for stray cats . If any readers would like to send in replies to this one , I will print the most humane . Q-In a recent column you said that the president of the condo board of directors should vote on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our seminar several months ago said your answer was incorrect . They said that Robert ' s Rules apply and the president may vote only to break what would otherwise be a tie vote . I would appreciate your comments . A-I hold to what I said before . In a general meeting of the membership , the rules you quoted apply . But , in a meeting of an elected " board of management " where the president is an elected director , he should vote on every issue . The people elected him or her to make decisions and direct , not break , ties . They have a right to know how every director feels on every issue . Directors do not even have the right to abstain , unless a conflict of interest is at issue . Except in those few cases , abstentions should be counted as " yea .
