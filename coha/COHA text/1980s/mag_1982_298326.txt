The first major upset of the political season occurred in New York last week . That result meant soft-spoken liberals will be the Democratic candidates for two important vacant governorships . In two heated House races , the candidates ' family ties and their economic ideologies are likely to be decisive factors in November . <P> Upset personality <P> The favorite was the feisty mayor of New York City , colorful and combative , immensely popular in the city he seemed to symbolize , and endorsed by the retiring Governor and most of the state 's political leaders . His challenger was the man he had beaten in a mayoralty race , the principled but somewhat colorless Lieutenant Governor , who had never won an election in his own right and was being outspent 2 to 1 in the current contest . But confounding both the polls and the pols , Mario Cuomo last week convincingly beat Edward Koch in New York 's Democratic gubernatorial primary . <P> The race lent itself less to analysis than to psychoanalysis . Many polls showed the mayor leading by about 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electorate 's ambivalent feelings about Koch , who is charming one moment , grating the next . <P> The results turned more on complex personality considerations than on substantive issues . On his way to winning re-election as mayor with 75% of the vote last year , Koch pledged at Jerusalem 's Wailing Wall that he would not abandon his beloved boroughs to run for higher office . But when Governor Hugh Carey decided not to seek a third term , Koch , 57 , set his sights on Albany . Some city voters seemed determined to keep Koch home : he ended up only splitting the city vote with Cuomo . ( In the 1977 mayor 's race , Koch topped Cuomo by a 55%-to-45% margin . ) Upstaters turned out in heavy numbers to vote 2 to 1 for Cuomo . They were rankled by Koch 's ill-advised interview with Playboy magazine earlier this year , in which he called rural life " a joke , " and put off by his wisecracking city style . <P> Cuomo , 50 , was smoother and less controversial , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor unions , minorities , liberals and upstaters . At a time when Koch and other fiscally conservative Democrats are thought to be the vanguard of a new wave of neoliberalism , Cuomo spoke of restoring the " soul of the Democratic Party " with values " that have been shared by a generation . " Among them : " Government has an aggressive role to play that 's deeper than preparing us for war or simply taking care of the rich . " <P> These ideals will make the November general election an ideological clash . Cuomo 's opponent is Lewis Lehrman , 44 , a drugstore-chain heir who pumped $3.7 million of his own into a record-setting $7 million primary campaign . Lehrman , a supply-side conservative who backed Ronald Reagan , champions the gold standard and , unlike Cuomo , believes strongly in capital punishment . Said Lehrman after last Thursday 's primaries : " Now it will be a choice between two points of view , two ways of looking at the world . " <P> California dreaming          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
