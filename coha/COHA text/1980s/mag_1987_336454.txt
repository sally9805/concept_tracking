Correspondent Jeanne McDowell found Sex Researcher Shere Hite settled serenely on a satiny love seat in Hite 's rococo Manhattan apartment . Instead of the antimale polemicist that McDowell had been warned about , she discovered a soft-spoken woman with a passion for classical music and antique clothes .

" The book makes men sound like smugly apathetic brutes who do n't care about depriving women of emotional sustenance , " he says . All of which confirms what Hite learned long ago : if you make people angry , they will listen . And , of course , read .
