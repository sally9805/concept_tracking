He is a young-looking 33 , and has never held public office . But when Joseph P. Kennedy II , the second of Robert Kennedy 's eleven children , announced last week that he will seek the Democratic nomination for the congressional seat to be vacated next year by outgoing Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill , he had the weight of history behind him : his uncle John F. Kennedy won Massachusetts ' Eighth Congressional District in 1946 . " That seat , " said another uncle , Senator Edward Kennedy , " obviously has special meaning to our family . " <P> Kennedy 's announcement made him an instant  --  though not necessarily overwhelming  --  favorite in a field of at least nine potential Democratic candidates , including two well-known local politicians and James Roosevelt Jr. , F.D.R. 's grandson . Commented State Senator George Bachrach , one of the top contenders : " Any time a Kennedy enters a race , he automatically becomes the front runner . " <P> That maxim may hearten Ted Kennedy , 53 , who is once again casting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the one in the Oval Office . The uncle 's ambition could affect the nephew . If Edward Kennedy runs for President in 1988 , he will vacate the Senate seat he has held for 23 years , possibly making room for another Bay State Kennedy . Voters in the politically savvy Eighth District , which includes Harvard University and M.I.T. , may not want to elect a novice who might start campaigning for higher office within the year . They have grown accustomed to long-term representatives : O'Neill has served since 1952 . The usually left-of-center district may also object to the neoliberal tone of Joseph Kennedy 's announcement speech : " The days of taxing and spending are over , " he proclaimed . " What 's needed in Washington is . . . someone who knows how to balance the books , get action and utilize some creativity . " <P> The younger Kennedy has demonstrated such credentials through the Citizens Energy Corp. , a successful nonprofit firm he founded in 1979 to provide low- cost heating oil to the state 's poor . If he persuades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might help give Congress its first brother- sister act . His sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend , 34 , a public interest lawyer on leave from her job in the Maryland attorney general 's office , is said to be considering running for the Second District in suburban Baltimore , where she has lived for about two years .
