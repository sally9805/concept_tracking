txt DO N'T KNOW what you 'll be doing Christmas Day , but I 'll be counting birds . So will 32,000 other people across the United States , Canada , Mexico , Central America and the Caribhon n Besides giving conservationists a rough idea of which birds need additional protection , the Christmas Count is the social event of the year for the International ornithological set . If you do n't participate in it , you 're not considered a serious birder . It 's an enormous undertaking . In California atone , G4 cities and towns report counts ; in Texas , 59 ; in New York , 53 . If you think counting birds in Brooklyn on Christmas Day is a waste of time , consider that the Brooklyn birders have , recorded such oddities as a yellowrumped warbler , a great blue heron and three very cold parakeets undoubtedly escapees . I 'm a lifelong back yard birder , but it was n't until lust fall that a friend suggested I join the Count . I had never heard of the Christmas Bird Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the anticipation and anxiety of troops counting down for a beach landing . BY TILE TIME we packed In our binoculars last Christmas Day , my 32,000 colleagues and I had counted 49,000,000 birds , give or take a sparrow or two . That was down a whopping GO million from 1979 , " That Was n't unusual , " says Bob Arbib , head counter of American Birds , which runs the count for the Na . Vona Audubon Society , " because it was probably just a lot of blackbirds . If one roost moves , you can lose 20 million birds . " There were 1,350 local counts last year , and about 10 percent of them had five or fewer participants . Five counts had only a single observer . The biggest count occurred in the area of York , Pa. : 4 million birds recorded . The count is conducted in rain , snow or whatever else the weather throws at you . At Baines Junction , in Canada 's Yukon , for example , nine spotters sighted nine species and 171 individuals  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 11 below . For some , the count starts In the dead of night . Owls , as any good birder knows , // aRIMpO Devoted ornithologists count on Christmas the day to keep their eyes on the skies // are only one of several nocturnal species that defy detection during the day . There are also whippoorwills ( which some people think say " whip . poor-weell , poor-wills which actually call out ' poor-Jill-fp " , black-crowned night herons and nighthawks . A good birder never goes to sleep . INSTRUCTIONS I received In the mall were very firm about all of this . " We expect everyone will start no later than 7 a.m. and quit no later than 5 p.m. dusk , " my orders read . " The count goes on even if it rains or snows . There are no cancellations . " The mimeographed letter , signed by the local Count Committee , let us know the import of our mission : " Do n't let us and others down . " It was like the squadron leader used to talk in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat , please owl before dawn , " it continued . To group leaders such as myself I had volunteered to lead two friends , the count letter added : " Announce to your followers that they should keep silent and stay behind you , and that they should attempt to contribute as much as possible by scanning for birds in opposite directions from the leader . " What had I gotten myself into ? I thought the count would be a lark so to speak , a fun way to spend Christmas . Now I had the feeling that the future of science was resting on my binoculars , that entire species could be put in jeopardy in the blink of an eye . THE DAY after I received this letter , I got a call from one of the members of the Count Committee . " I 'm just calling to remind you to look for hairy woodpeckers , " ho said . " You know , the count is ' depending on your area to come up with a hairy woodpecker . " Your area , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year that yielded a few hairys . " " Oh , " I responded , as non-committally as possible . " You know what a hairy Woodpecker sounds like , do n't you ? " asked the committeeman . " It 's almost like a kingfisher 's rattle . Have you ever heard a kingfisher ? " " Well , not exactly , . ... " " A hairy woodpecker , " he tried again , " sounds something like a downy woodpecker , but in the hairy the call is more like a ' pick , ' whereas in tho downy it 's more like a ' peck . ' " " I see , " I lied . The difference in notes , even when he imitated the two , was not apparent to me . It quickly became clear that I would have to rely on sight alone . NEXT CAME a devastating setback . My two " followers " canceled out a few days before Christmas . Neither , I am sure , had seen the official count letter , which made all cancellations plainly illegal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future counts . The fearsome instructions and lack of troops notwithstanding , I nevertheless was determined to fulfill my mission . I would cover the entire area , about 5 square miles , myself . I would not be responsible for the demise of ornithology . And then my whole world collapsed . On Christmas Eve , I lost my wallet . My situation seemed hopeless : I was not an expert birder , I was a group leader without a group . And now I was without a driver 's license at a time when I was counted on to drive 10 miles at the crack of dawn to my assigned area . Out of desperation , I explained my plight to the local police . " Could I drive without a license , just this one time ? " I pleaded . ? " Yes , " a policeman who was also a part-time // libmpo Birders follow in Santa 's wake , but they are n't out there looking for reindeer // birder assured me . " I 'll vouch for you if there 's trouble . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From high atop a slope called Mulholland Hill in Lafayette , Cal. , I watched hawks soar through the early morning stillness . One red-tail alighted briefly on a power pole while I peeked at him through my binoculars from directly below . He seemed to know I was counting him and wanted to make sure I had him correctly identified . I saw bins later in the day perched on another pole waiting to get counted by some other birder , no doubt . WHICH BRINGS us to one ofthe most frequent questions about the count : " How do you know you 're not counting the same bird twice ? , ' The answer is , " You do n't . " Of course , no one ever gives this answer . The suitable thing to say is that " Birds hove their own territories , just like dogs and cats . " Sure , I tabulated 316 robins , 1 mockingbird , 13 scrub jays , 2 steller 's jays , and several dozen birds of common species . The most uncommon bird I found was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades of gray . As for hairy woodpeckers , I came across a pair of them in the tall , arching . trees of a stream in the canyon below the hill . I was cure they were hairys  --  not because they " picked , " which they did not , but because of their size and coloration . To be absolutely certain , I flushed them from tree to tree for about a half mile to check their wing patterns . All seemed right . AT ABOUT 3:30 In the afternoon , the stillness and fog turned to showers . Flocks of robins crisscrossed the road to head for cover . I counted as ? many as I could from my car . The final episode of Count Day came that night when I turned in my findings . I had seen more than 600 birds . The turn-in site was a Knoll room crammed with birdwatchers  --  many of them drenched from the rain and shuddering from the winter freeze  --  and their paraphernalia . Soup , bread and coffee were served , courtesy of the Audubon Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birder gets a meal , mention of his name in the official national count book and , if he 's really lucky , mention of the best birds he spotted on the Rare Bird Alert telephone recording , which lists all of the rare birds seen locally . In Chicago the number is 675-8466 , and the recording also lists local bird counts amateurs catihelp I did n't stay for the count compilation , which lasted well into the night . But I did hear from the sbuirsdpepectople . One of my sightings turned out to be " Did you really see a blue-gray gnatcatcher ? " committee member asked . I had turned in a half-page of detailed notes based on the sightings of this one bird  --  where I had seen it , at what time , what it was doing , etc . " How big was the tail ? " the caller demanded . " Did it flick up or down ? What color was it ? How ' long did you watch it ? " After 10 minutes of intensive quizzing , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks . " I felt a bit hurt after trying so hard and then having to put up with such harassment . I wondered if my blue-gray was really going to be accepted . When the next Rare Bird Alert telephone recording was aired , mention was made of the sighting of numerous uncommon birds seen on the count  --  but no blue-gray gnatcatcher. was crushed . I felt like the dog who returns the stick but gets no pat on the head . But the wounded feelings healed in a few days and I began to miss the lonely camaraderie of the big watch , Now I 'm counting the days again . Indopondont Wows Alliance
