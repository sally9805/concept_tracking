Zhao comes calling on the U.S. " There is a saying , " Premier Zhao Ziyang once remarked of his agricultural experiments in China 's Sichuan province , " ' When you cross the river , you grope for the stones ' But you must cross the river . You can not just jump over it . " This week Zhao will apply that delicate maxim to the troubled waters of Chinese-U.S. relations , which until three months ago were in their most turbulent state since Richard Nixon 's opening to China in 1972 . As he left Peking for his first visit to the U.S. and talks with President Reagan this week , Zhao indicated a disarming willingness to help eliminate the obstacles that have stood in the way of closer relations between the two countries . Among the major difficulties : Washington 's granting of political asylum to Chinese Tennis Player Hu Na ; Peking 's curtailment of cultural exchanges with the U.S. ; a Chinese boycott of American agricultural products ; and , most troublesome of all , U.S. arms sales to Taiwan . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve such problems . He has traveled abroad relatively little and speaks no English . Yet he is at ease with foreigners and has a reputation as a deft , and occasionally witty , diplomat . After he became a member of the Politburo in 1979 , he surprised many Chinese , long bored by tight restrictions on dress , by appearing in public in a Western tie and jacket , the first high official to do so since the Cultural Revolution . Like most of China 's present leaders , Zhao was brutalized by the Red Guards . In 1967 he was paraded through the streets of Canton in a dunce 's cap and denounced as " a stinking remnant of the landlord class . " He has come a long way from that parade , and in the process has effected a more substantive revolution of his own . His agricultural reforms as governor of Sichuan ( among them : allowing peasants to keep some profits ) increased productivity by 25% . They were subsequently adopted for the nation as a whole . <P> Deng Xiaoping , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was so impressed that he promoted Zhao to the top government post of Premier in 1980 . Since then Zhao has assumed increasing responsibility for foreign policy and emerged as the leading proponent of closer ties with Washington . At a Western-style news conference for U.S. and Canadian reporters last week in Peking 's Great Hall of the People , Zhao , 64 , dapper in a trim-cut suit and polka-dotted tie , fielded questions for more than an hour . He seized the occasion to set the tone of his forthcoming visit , sketching out areas of cooperation between the U.S. and China and skillfully down-playing difficulties of the past . When reporters alluded to one of the more recent " difficulties " - President Reagan 's reference to Taiwan as the " Republic of China " during his visit to Japan in November-Zhao acknowledged that the President 's feeling of friendship for Taiwan was understandable . In a noteworthy gesture of conciliation , Zhao added that he would not ask Reagan to stop U.S. arms sales to Taiwan " completely and immediately . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
