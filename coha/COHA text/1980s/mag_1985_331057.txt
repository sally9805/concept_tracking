Every week Americans eagerly scratch coins or other objects across the surfaces of some 40 million " instant-win " lottery tickets to find out if they have hit the jackpot . But whether they jump for joy or toss away another losing ticket in disgust , the national love of lotteries has made big winners of two Atlanta-based companies , Scientific Games and Dittler Bros . They are the undisputed champions of instant-win games , one of the most popular forms of legalized gambling . <P> The two firms , which in 1984 produced 1.5 billion tickets for games in eleven states , control 70% of the instant-win lottery business in the U.S. Scientific Games ' lottery revenues rocketed from $100,000 in 1973 to $30 million in 1983 . Dittler Bros. , a wholly owned subsidiary of Southam , a Canadian newspaper group , does not publicly report sales or earnings . <P> The Atlanta companies joined forces in 1974 after Scientific Games developed the idea for instant-win lotteries . The concept was based on promotional contests that Scientific , then barely a year old , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent for the games , performing all marketing , design and administrative work , while Dittler is the printer . <P> Dittler was founded in 1902 by Brothers Emil and Alex Dittler as a printer of railroad schedules . But by the 1970s it had expanded its product range to include business cards , hotel directories and contest tickets . Says Dittler Chairman Gilbert Bachman : " We had already produced literally billions of promotional game tickets for other companies , so it was just a matter of taking our know-how and applying it to the instant lottery ticket concept . " <P> Until the advent of instant lotteries , state-sponsored games were conducted by drawing . While such contests still have 70% of the market , scratch-ticket lotteries are growing in popularity because of the instant gratification  --  or dejection . Today , for a bet of $1 , a lucky player can collect up to $100,000 . <P> About 80% of all instant-win lottery tickets are sold in five states : Colorado , Illinois , Michigan , New York and Pennsylvania . Dittler and Scientific Games expect their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Oregon signed a contract calling for the delivery of at least 100 million instant-win tickets in 1985 . California is expected to approve a lottery later this year . <P> The games are also popular abroad . Dittler Bros. printed a total of 50 million tickets in 1984 for Argentina , Australia , Canada and Israel . Says Robert Mote , a vice president of Scientific Games : " People everywhere like to know if they are winners  --  immediately . "
