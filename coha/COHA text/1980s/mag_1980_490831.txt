THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IV E have noticed that in many  --  perhaps in most  --  public and private conversations about the crisis in Soviet-American relations that has been touched off by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan there comes a moment when argument ceases and a silence falls . Such a discussion usually takes its departure from President Carter 's declaration , in his State of the Union Message , that the United States will use whatever means arc necessary , including military force , to protect the Persian Gulf area from any outside intervention  --  meaning , of course , Soviet intervention  --  and it proceeds with inquiry into how this is to be done . The ensuing debate in government circles and in the press and on television has precipitated what George Kerman has called the greatest " militarization of thought and discourse " since the Second 1,1/orld War . Proposals for strengthening United States forces in the Middle East and elsewhere abound , and it seems almost impossible to pick up a newspaper or turn on the television these days without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapid Deployment Force or of new American bases around the world or of an across-the-board military buildup . Most of these speculations were inspired by the situation in the Middle East , but it is a striking peculiarity of the proposals that have been made so far that none of them solve the problem at hand ; namely , how to make good on the President 's vow to protect the Persian Gulf from Soviet aggression . The assumption seems to be that the United States should prepare to fight a conventional land war with the Soviet Union in the Middle East , yet in Iran , for example , the Soviets would now enjoy an estimated fiveto-one advantage in conventional forces in a war , and , as several observers have pointed out , not even the most warlike American strategists have put forward any proposal that would correct the imbalance . In fact , the whole discussion has remained oddly detached from the crisis that provoked it . It is at this point in the debate when all imagin-able American conventional countermeasures have been canvassed and their inadequacy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes little sense to propose defenses whose futility is known in advance , the new crop of strategists for some reason draw back from outlining the next , possibly remedial step . However , a recent headline in the Times spelled out what that step would probably have to be . " STUDY SAYS SOVIET THRUST IN IRAN MIGHT REQUIRE U.S. ATOM ARMS , " the headline said , and the story beneath reported that a Defense Department study had found that " American forces could not stop a Soviet thrust into northern Iran and that the United States should therefore consider using tactical ' nuclear weapons in any conflict there . " The Times story carried the public discussion a step further than it usually goes , but one does not have to be a military specialist to see that the questions do not end there . After all , would the Soviet Union sit by while the United States launched nuclear missiles ? " tactical " or otherwise  --  at its troops ? For that matter , having foreseen the defeat of our conventional forces , and our probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to strike first ? Or would they find that in order to counter this probability they were " required " to make the first use of nuclear weapons  --  of which they possess an abundance , although our armchair strategists sometimes seem to forget it . In short , what the Defense Department study appeared to depict as the end of one story would also be the beginning of another  --  a far more terrible story , which is certainly told in Defense Department studies that have not yet been leaked to the Times . But even to pose these questions , or to ask what other moves and countermoves the two superpowers might make once the nuclear threshold was crossed , is to remember that all such moves , from the use of tactical weapons on up to the final conflagration , have been carried through to their logical conclusions in numberless scenarios that now lie waiting in computers in Washington and Moscow . It is quite possible that in these highly elaborated plans of action the phase of conventional war would be regarded as so much waste motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story makes clear , all the decisive weapons in any direct encounter between the superpowers arc nuclear . The problem is not one of American weakness . Our tactical nuclear forces do indeed nullify the Soviet advantage in conventional forces in the Middle East , just as their strategic nuclear forces nullify our tactical forces , and so on , until every last missile has been launched and both countries have been obliterated . Neither country is militarily weak in the face of the other , but both are weak to the point of helplessness in the face of the nuclear peril . The strategic planners on both sides know that as soon as the first shot is fired between American and Soviet troops , the two nations will be reckoning their fates in megatons and mega-deaths , not in numbers of tanks or Army divisions . This is why , in all the crises and wars of the post-Second World War period , no such shot has ever been fired , and it is why it must never he fired . Under conditions like these , discussions of conventional war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being unreal . They resemble not so much serious plans for our national defense as reveries on past wars that are as extinct as we soon may be if we try to wage one again . Since avoidance of nuclear destruction is the greatest interest that any nation could have , why is it that when we are brought face to face with it we grow silent instead of seeking some diplomatic way out of the impasse ? Do we feel that by pronouncing the name of doom we make it a little bit more real and therefore a little hit more likely ? Do we feel a natural embarrassment in the presence of a new form of the obscene ? Do we feel that to speak casually of something as vast and inapprehensible as the end of the world would , like taking the name of God in vain , he blasphemous ? Or do we perhaps for a moment pass in advance into the zone of extinction , and fall silent in anticipation of the great silence that would descend upon the entire earth if the Russians and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war ? ? ? MicroWonder v. En-Gen EACH year , the Young Lawyers Committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York stages a moot-court competition for law students throughout the country . The competition is tough , the prizes are substantial ( sets of law hooks and some silver trophies ) , and the honor of finishing high can be a feather in the cap of anyone who intends to set out on a career in law . There are other national and regional moot-court competitions , and many law schools offer courses in moot court , but the competition run by the Young Lawyers Committee , known simply as the National Moot Court Competition , is the oldest such tournament in the United States , and is also one of the most widely respected . A couple of weeks ago , the thirtieth annual National Moot Court Competition reached its concluding rounds , in the Bar Association 's headquarters , on West Forty-fourth Street , and we went over to see how things were going . Teams from twenty-seven law schools had made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which began last August and included teams from a hundred and sixty-two schools  --  and , on the afternoon we stopped by , all but four of the twenty-seven had been eliminated and it was time for the semifinals . At around three o'clock , we spoke with Sharon E. Grubin , this year 's chairperson of the Young Lawyers Committee , and Deborah E. Lans , this year 's secretary , in a room on the main floor . They explained that they , together with other members of the committee , had dreamed up the imaginary case that was being argued in this year 's competition . The case  --  MicroWonder , Inc. , v. Environmental Genetics Laboratories , Inc. ? was extremely complicated , dealing with biochemistry , molecular biology , and patent law , and presenting some tricky constitutional issues . " In a lower court  --  supposedly  --  a jury awarded MicroWonder a hundred and fifty-eight million dollars in damages , to be paid by Environmental Genetics , or En-Gen , as it 's called , " Ms. Lans said . " But the judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series of interrogatories , or special questions  --  and the petitioner , MicroWonder , asked that the case he tried before another jury . But En-Gen , the respondent , asked that the case he retried without a jury , and this is where the constitutional questions come in  --  questions involving the Seventh Amendment . " She handed us a transcript of the case , and we saw that it had originated in Krypton City , in the state of Krypton , and that supposedly it had already been argued in a United States District Court and in the Court of Appeals for the Twelfth Circuit . " There is no Twelfth Circuit , of course , " Ms. Grubin said . " And a lot of the names are whimsical  --  for instance , one of the judges in the transcript is called Katz , and two others are named after my cats . But the case really deals with some important issues . One of our goals each year is to find a problem that is being discussed a lot in legal circles  --  one that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Seventh Amendment has to do with the right to a jury trial in suits at common law , Recently , some ll rs ? ? ? ? .. niss lllllllll Vint " ' cases have grown so enormously complex  --  especially when they deal with modern technology  --  that juries have n't been able to understand them . Some judges have n't been able to understand them , either  --  at least , not without help . This is a subject of increasing concern among lawyers . Not long ago , in fact , Chief Justice Burger encouraged the bar to consult as to whether jury trials are appropriate in such complicated cases . " The semifinal round was about to begin , so we thanked the two lawyers and walked over to an improvised courtroom , where a three-member team from the University of Denver was about to take on a three-member team from Texas Tech University . ( During the competition , each school was permitted to have either two or three people on its team , and a team 's score after each round was based both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five black-robed men were on the bench  --  two real judges and three real lawyers  --  and after the law students posing as lawyers had presented their cases and had answered a barrage of questions from the bench Texas Tech was declared the winner of that contest . Meanwhile , another semifinal argument was taking place in an improvised courtroom upstairs  --  before three black-robed men and two black-robed women  --  and in that one Boston College defeated the Illinois Institute of Technology . At about six , we went up to the Carter Room ( named for James C. Carter , a past president of the Bar Association ) , on the second floor , where cocktails were being served to the team members and also to about three hundred guests , many of them members of the bar . Before long , we fell into conversation with a tall , mustached young man named Seymour Joseph , who is a member of the University of Denver team . He told us that even though his team had just lost , he felt exhilarated . " We 've been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Denver has n't participated in this competition for more than fifteen years , so we think we 've done awfully well to come this far . " Dinner , with a main course of Yankee pot roast , was served in the adjoining reception room , and at about eight o'clock the final round began , in the large meeting hall just across the way , with the afternoon 's winners  --  Texas Tech and Boston College  --  facing each other . The bench , which was acting as the United States Supreme Court , consisted of Judge Wilfred " Just like you , David . He was born in February , too ! " Feinberg , of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ; Judge Leonard I. Garth , of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ; Judge Edward R. Becker , of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ; judge Charles I ) . Breitel , the former chief justice of the New York Court of Appeals ; Haliburton Fales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case ; James E. S. Baker , the president of the American College of Trial Lawyers ; and Morrell E. Clark , Jr. , the president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York . During the next two hours , while about three hundred people sat listening , the two teams argued their cases . At the conclusion of their arguments , the judges left the room to deliberate , and in about twenty minutes they returned . Judge Feinberg announced that the winner was Texas Tech . The members of the Texas Tech team  --  Fred D. Raschke , R. Jeanette Robison , and David B. Weinstein  --  embraced each other , and the audience applauded . As people began to leave the meeting hall , we spoke with Judge Breitel , a strong-faced man with keen eyes behind horn-rimmed glasses , who was wearing a black judicial robe . " I 've been involved in a lot of moot courts , and I 've taught a lot of classes , and I 'm convinced that this is one of the most broadening experiences a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In law school , it 's unusual to get experience in appellate proceedings , so this gives these people something they might never have otherwise . And we often get feedback from the students who participate here , telling us how much they feel they 've henefitted . I have a hunch we 'll he hearing from these young people again . " Watching the Stars OUR friend Richard likes basket-11/4 , ball , and can execute a jump shot with the best of them . Ile led us down to Madison Square Garden the other night to see the New York Stars , a team that plays in the Women 's Pro Basketball League . We headed for the crowd that was waiting to enter the main arena , but Richard gently guided us around the hack of the building to the Felt Forum , on Eighth Avenue . " The frivolous people are here to see the Rangers  --  they play on skates  --  hut we 're here on serious business , " Richard said . " The Stars have a game against the Houston Angels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best basketball team in the city . Right now , they 're going for their twelfth win in a row , but I think they 're going to have a tough time tonight . " We asked Richard if he 'd seen the team before . " Oh , yes  --  in December , " he said . " I really love basketball , and I wanted to see hnw good they were . Besides , I was stuck in the city during the Long Island Rail Road strike . I saw them again before a Knicks game . They are sometimes the opening act for the Knicks . " We took our seats half an hour before game time , and looked around the Felt Forum . " This is really a dive , " Richard said . " Look at that low ceiling . This setup reminds me of a church league . " Soon the Stars filed in at a slow run  --  eleven young women dressed in shiny royal-blue warmup suits . About a thousand people applauded them . " Wel , they look as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced a figure-eight lay-up drill , which went nicely with some disco music that was coming over the loudspeaker system . The Angels were at the opposite end of the court , practicing their own drills . Then the Stars began a foul-shooting drill that involved lots of handclapping . " The men pros would never do that , " Richard told us . " It 's too collegiate . It 's not cool . " The Stars gathered around their coach  --  Dean Meminger , a former Knick  --  who was wearing a natty gray windowpane-check suit and was biting his nails . The players were introduced , the national anthem was sung by a young man from a local school  --  a cappella and full of mistakes  --  and the game was under way . " Watch No. 11 , Sharon Farrah , " Richard said . " She 's a rookie guard for the Stars , drafted No. 1 out of the University of Missouri . She 's a tough kid . She looks as if she really wanted to do harm to someone . Best snarl I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , No. 10 . She 's only five feet three , and looks as if she were n't afraid of anything . She can scoot around all night . She can dribble faster than I can talk . And there 's No. 6 , Gail Marquis , who 's my favorite . She scores a lot , and she sure can bound . She 's also beautiful . The best thing about her is that she does everything without changing her expression . It 's hard to he cool when you 're getting hit in the stomach with four or five elbows , but she is . She 's cooler than Walt Frazier was . Positively serene . Oh , and there are the Young twins . Faye and Kaye , No. 22 and No. 20 . I 've seen them in two games and one yogurt commercial . Now that I think about it , they 're my favorites . They may not be as good as some of the other Stars , but they really take the game seriously . In fact , that 's why I like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole forty-eight minutes . A lot of the men pros are zombies until the fourth quarter . If the referees gave out technical fouls for snoozing , most N.B.A. trams would be in trouble . I do n't worry about whether the women play better than the men . They 're good , period . And they 're my height . They give you your money 's worth . " The Stars did have a tough time . They watched the smaller and faster Angels , who ref used to fade , run around them on the way to a ten-point lead . The Stars did n't catch up until the end of the third quarter , and they just managed to win , by a point . The final basket was made by No. 12 , Pearl Moore . When she played for Francis Marion College , she scored over four thousand points  --  a college-basketball record for women and men . Pearl Moore 's shot was a short jumper off a drive , delivered from beneath a crush of Angels . " Wow !

A couple of days later , in his column , Earl Wilson wrote : Sly Stallone was wearing a very dark beard . He looked like a great blackberry pie with a face in the middle . Slickly neat in a grey suit , he moved about quickly , authoritatively , at Maxwell 's Plum .

" independent " in this case meaning that nobody in the organization actually gets paid to utter opinions on the cinema  --  showed up the other night at Cannon 's Bar &; Grill , at 108th Street and Broadway , drank several pitchers of beer , and made a numbing amount of noise . The occasion was the fifth annual selection and announcement of the winners of the Ira Awards . With the exception of the eponymous Ira Hozinsky , all the judges  --  there were a dozen present at Cannon 's , a neighborhood tavern  --  hold or are working toward degrees , mainly undergraduate , from Columbia , a neighborhood university . Hozinsky , who works for an export management company , has attended Brooklyn College off and on in recent years . A friend of his , George Robinson , was the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , during his tenure , developed a technique for reducing his reviews to conversational shorthand . " Nah , do n't bother , " Robinson used to tell people . " Ira saw it and did n't like it . " It seems that at that time someone Hozinsky knew was giving him free passes to about two hundred screenings per year . This fact impressed several of Robinson 's other friends , and upon organizing what was first known as the Columbia Film Critics Circle and later evolved into the New York Independent Film Critics they decided to christen their annual prizes the Iras . Hozinsky is the only living legend in the group . He has collar-length brown hair , hangs that descend to the dark frames of his eyeglasses , and a squarish , irregularly bearded face . When he smiles , only his bottom teeth show . " In a way , you could say that we 're more film nerds than film critics , " said a member of the group named Mason Wiley , who told us that he graduated from Columbia Journalism School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're the sort of people who go to sec a film at the Museum of Modern Art and rush to get a seat in the front row .
