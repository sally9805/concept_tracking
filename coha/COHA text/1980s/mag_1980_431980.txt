 | After 25 years of studying ghosts and inestigating psychic phenomena , I have learned to listen closely . Now , as I was talking to Douglas Johnson , an engineer with a prominent Philadelphia firm , I was listening with all my might . tie was telling me the story of a nightmare he 'd lived through several years earlier while traveling in Virginia on business . He 'd sent for me to see if I could make some sense out of the strange events he 'd experienced . " When I awakened at dawn ; ' Doug was saying , " a weight  | " When I awakened at dawn , " Doug was saying , " a tremendous weight was pressing on my chest . I could n't see it , but it was so powerful I thought I would n't be able to breathe another second . I clenched and unclenched my fists and tried to roll over , but I could n't budge . This terrible force was crushing down on me , harder and harder , until I felt my life being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange bed hundreds of miles from home , I was sure I was going to die ! " Doug Johnson swallowed hard . " You do believe me ? " " Every word . " I assured him . He twisted uncomfortably in his seat . He was hesitating and I knew why . Tales of ghosts and hauntings are acceptable from writers and artists ? but not from engineers . " I 've never told anyone about this before ? " " I can appreciate how you feel , " I said . " But do n't worry . To me. an experience in a haunted room is neither strange nor inexplicable . Please continue . " Doug cleared his throat and went on , " Just as I thought I would surely expire from lack of oxygen . the weight lifted . I could n't believe what I was seeing . Suspended over me was a black form ? a badly misshapen figure with grotesque stumps for arms and legs , and a face like a smashed-in bulldog 's with violently distorted features . I lay stiff with shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise . Suddenly , without warning , it vanished ! " I lay there for long seconds before I realized the room was ice cold . I was shivering . Then gradually the air got warmer and my heart began to beat steadily again . " Anyone looking at Doug Johnson would size him up as a levelheaded man , practically impossible to intimidate . Yet , that night in the Virginia motel , something had almost frightened him to death . What had it been ? Doug had come to his own conclusion . " There was an evil spirit in that room with me ? there had to be ! " I shook my head . " I do n't think so , " I said . " There was something there all right , but I suspect it was a thought force of some kind rather than an evil spirit . " My years of research into psychic phenomena had convinced me that thoughts can be things . We not only think them , we can see , feel , hear . and touch them . Thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are connected to . " When a person experiences a traumatic event , he feels a powerful emotional response , " I explained . " This response remains behind in a kind of psychic ether . Days , months , even years later , when another sensitive mortal steps into that mental atmosphere , he will pick up or tune into those thoughts . It 's much the way a person tunes into the sound waves all around him on his radio . If you 're one of the people able to pick up thoughts out of the atmosphere , " I told Doug , " your mind will reenact the scene that once took place . " " What do you think took place in that motel room ? " " I do n't know , " I replied . " But something happened there and I 'm going to find out . I 'm headed south next week to do some research . I 'll make it a point to stop at that town in Virginia and stay in that same room . " T he motel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Appomattox River . I checked in at dusk and asked for the same room Doug had occupied . Luckily it was free . It was small , with the usual furnishings : double bed with tweedy bedspread , long , low chest , metal rack with three wire hangers . On one wall hung a dark-framed mirror , and over the bed a picture of a  | dirt path winding through a wood . There was a tiny bathroom with a stall shower . Within minutes I had my small suitcase unpacked . was undressed and ready to step into the shower . As I pulled back the shower curtain , I thought I heard a sound from the bedroom . I paused and listened . Dead silence . Still , I had a distinct feeling that I was not alone . I slipped on my robe and went back into the bedroom . A figure at my elbow sent my senses reeling ? until I realized it was nothing more deadly than my raincoat hanging outside the bathroom door ! I smiled to myself for such foolishness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed before 10 p.m .. weary from a long day 's driving , but far from exhausted . In fact . I felt quite expectant . Something was waiting there to be realized by me . I lay in bed wondering what it might be . I could almost feel my eyes and ears tingling with anticipation in the darkness . Then it happened . An indistinct sound came from the door at the left side of the room . I listened hard , every sense alerted . Gradually the sound grew louder . It was a series of gasps . Someone was making a desperate effort to breathe ! I lay perfectly still and listened . I knew that no one was , in fact , at my door breathing with difficulty . I knew I was alone . Yet not alone . A memory was there trying to talk to me . I did n't move a muscle . The struggling breaths ceased . Then I heard the sound of something heavy ? like a body , too weighty to be carried ? being dragged across the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I saw the figures . There were two people at the foot of my bed . One was a dark-haired man of about 20. and on his back he carried a small blond boy of about sev- en or eight . The boy 's head was soft and limp , His arms hung over the older man 's chest . My mouth opened , but I could n't speak . Anyway . I knew there was no need to . Then the two forms faded into the night . I closed my eyes briefly . When I opened them , another scene revealed itself . The metal jaws of a bright yellow crane were trying to catch up a large piece of wreckage . Then the crane vanished . The next morning I inquired of the desk clerk , the chambermaid , and the motel owner whether any unusual or traumatic events had taken place at that motel or in the neighborhood over the years . From the desk clerk I got an uncomprehending stare . The chambermaid told me there had been a train derailment in a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said . I did n't think that what I was looking for would have occurred that far away . I persisted . I found the motel owner and spoke to him . I told him I knew there was a train track close by because I 'd heard the train whistle at night . Had there been a wreck on that line ? He thought a moment and shook his head . ' . dope . Had there ever been an accident involving tractor trailers or large trucks on the highway in front of the motel ? No. the motel owner could n't recall any . I left the haunted motel and made my way to a nearby plantation that was on my list of places to visit for research into psychic phenomena . I told the owner about my night in the motel room , ending with my opinion that an accident involving a large vehicle had occurred close by . Suddenly she sat forward in her chair . " You 're right . " she said . " there was ! Sometime in the 1930s , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a load of passengers skidded  | on that bridge and broke through the guardrail . The bus plunged into the river and everyone on board was killed . " She put a hand on my arm . " And I clearly remember , it did indeed take a huge crane to pull that wreckage out of the river ! " Hours later I drove to Richmond and made my way to a local newspaper office where I spent hours looking through old clippings . At last I found what I was looking for . In December 1935 , a large interstate bus went into a skid on the old bridge and plunged over the rail . The bus driver was crushed to death behind the wheel . Before a rescue could be attempted everyone had drowned . Now I had my explanation for the puzzling phenomena in the little motel room . Doug Johnson ? and I ? had psychically picked up on that earlier tragic event . Our subconscious minds had tuned into those past happenings and relayed the information to our conscious minds . Doug was able to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus driver had experienced in his last moments . I 'd heard the sounds of people trapped underwater in the bus and trying to get their breaths . And then I 'd tuned into the sound of the bodies being dragged up the embankment . And , finally , I 'd seen the crane that was used to lift out the crushed bus . The accident was a matter of journalistic record . It had actually happened . But I could not find any information about the dark-haired rescuer I had envisioned or about the little blond-haired boy on his back . W by did these experiences reveal themselves to Doug and me and probably to few others who had stopped at that motel ? I suspect it 's because of empathy ? the capacity to feel very strongly what other people feel . Not everyone who comes upon a haunting site experiences the paranormal . Only those of us who have a sensitivity to a past trauma are able to tune in on it . Then there 's another reason that could explain why I saw those past events so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident ? one in which both my parents were killed in a car crash 25 years ago . After completing my newspaper search in Richmond , I called my husband ( who works for the same engineering firm as Doug ) and told him the whole story . " Please ask Doug if he ever drove a bus or truck , " I asked him . " I feel he did and that that 's why he could pick up what the bus driver went through that day . " I do n't have to ask him , " my husband said . " I can tell you right now . He does drive a truck on occasion . In fact , if any of our equipment has to be shipped in an emergency , it 's Doug who handles it . " There you have it . Today , Doug still shakes his head in wonder at the experience . And I keep searching for stories and proof of even more " inexplicable " events . What may seem incomprehensible or even impossible to most of us is , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a past event and a person in the present who can re-experience it .
