The fighting has fallen into a pattern and the war is deadlocked , according to rebel commanders and fighters interviewed in Afghanistan in five and a half months of travel through the country with rebel convoys . The Soviet-backed leaders of Afghanistan have not permitted visits by Western reporters to the Government side of the front. // The Russians have said repeatedly that they will negotiate with the existing Communist Government in Kabul on a withdrawal of Soviet troops only after Western and other aid to the rebels is cut off. // Rebel leaders are unanimous in saying that the Russians , estimated at 118 , 000 troops , must withdraw to the last man and tank and that they will not accept any formula that would keep the Communist Government in place . The rebels say that if any attempt is made to impose a diplomatic solution on them , they will fight on alone . They say they believe a long struggle lies ahead. // // No Quick Solution Seen // Reagan Administration officials in Washington and many Western diplomats , military authorities and scholars agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of these sources , the United Nations-sponsored negotiations in Geneva , where indirect talks aimed at the eventual withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan have been under way since 1982 , are merely a forum for a propaganda initiative for the Russians. // These sources say the Russians are eager to picture themselves as genuinely interested in peace while gaining time to educate a new generation of Afghans who will give them a reliable surrogate army and political and administrative group to run the Government. // They say the United States and other countries should increase aid to the rebels to prod the Russians into negotiations to withdraw . <> <> U.S. Offers to Be Guarantor // At the meeting in Geneva last month between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev , the Soviet leader , some American officials said they detected a readiness by the Russians for a negotiated settlement. // To encourage this , American officials in Washington said , the United States offered this month to act as a guarantor to a " comprehensive and balanced settlement " that would include the withdrawal of Soviet troops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In the fighting itself , rebel commanders and fighters say their forces in one area or another have become more active , pressing in on some outposts or harassing a major garrison town . They say the Russians send a large tank column to the beleaguered point and it punches its way through , bringing relief supplies and scattering the rebel forces . It then withdraws. // The rebels filter back to their posts and gather men and supplies to make up for what has been lost . A few months later or perhaps the next year the cycle is repeated , with no permanent change in fixed positions . <> <> A Flow of Refugees // The cost for the rebels has been great . Hardly a village has escaped damage , either through direct action or because of the disruption of commerce and trade . Schools , hospitals , factories and much else created in 20 years of modernization starting in the 1950 ' s have been destroyed . The attrition continues . An average of 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 refugees are estimated to flee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European medical workers who have lived for as long as six months in remote areas of the country agree that the Afghans have not been traumatized by the war. // Dilapidated trucks , often captured Soviet vehicles using Soviet gasoline , travel across the country from east to west carrying passengers and goods . Farmers plow their fields , and shepherds tend their flocks of goats and sheep . Villagers can be seen repairing a mud wall , clearing a small irrigation ditch or putting a new door on a house. // In the city of Khanabad in Kunduz Province , bordering the Soviet Union , not a single house is habitable . A rebel commander , asked where the people had gone , said : " The rich managed to go to the United States or Europe . Others went to Pakistan . But almost all are in villages right here. " // He pointed to green paddy fields , planted with the rice almost ready for harvest , that stretched from the edge of Khanabad to the distant mountains where the irrigation system ended . <> <> A Living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European medical workers as well as Afghans themselves say Afghanistan remains a living and viable society. // The question is how long this will continue to be the case . American and Pakistani officials and others who monitor the situation say they believe that the Russians have greater staying power and that a prolonged struggle could mean death for the insurgency. // " If the war takes a long time , that will not be to our advantage , " said Shamsuddin Majrooh , who headed a committee that drafted a liberal Constitution for Afghanistan in the 1960 ' s . Now 80 years old , he lives with his son in Pakistan . " Our human resources and food supplies will be exhausted , " he said. // " Gradually people will have to turn to the Russians for help , and the Russians will be able to establish a position in Afghanistan . " <> <> Morale Seems High // For the moment , rebel morale seems high and new recruits continue to join the cause. // Seen on a trip to Balkh Province , bordering the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sent south to Pakistan for arms and training . Scores of village youths had walked for two or three days and crowded into the leader ' s compound . Some carried letters of recommendation from a rebel leader in their villages. // Others had letters from their fathers . " Please take my son , " one of them said . " I have many children and no land and can not feed them all. " // Asked about the availability of recruits , a score or more local commanders in many parts of Afghanistan said they could easily double or triple their forces if they had enough weapons and enough money to feed and clothe them . <> <> ' If We Had Better Weapons ' // " Despite the shortage of weapons and weapons of poor quality , if we have been able to achieve what we have in the past six or seven years , you can imagine what we could achieve with proper weapons , " said Pir Sayyid Ahmed Gailani , a leader of one of the traditionalist political parties. // The thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the so-called fundamentalist parties . " It is a fact the war will be prolonged , " he said . " If we had better weapons and could attack larger bases , we could make the war very expensive and they might want to leave. " // American diplomatic and military officials in Washington say it must be made more difficult for the Russians to stay in Afghanistan than to leave . They say that now is the time to increase military and humanitarian aid , while the morale of rebel soldiers and civilians is high . Rebel leaders agree. // There is strong support for the rebels in the Reagan Administration and Congress . Many American officials say any appeasement of the Russians in Afghanistan would send the wrong message to Moscow . <> <> The Flow of Arms // A steady flow of small arms and ammunition , mostly of Chinese manufacture but paid for by the United States , is reaching the fighting fronts , according to foreign travelers in Afghanistan . In recent months there has been a noticeable increase in the number of helicopters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This appears to indicate that the rebels are getting better antiaircraft weapons , probably Soviet-style SAM-7 missiles . Rebel commanders say they are firing more long-range ground-to-ground missiles to hit the Russians in their garrisons and city strongholds. // According to the Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad , Pakistan , about 5 , 000 rebels are killed in fighting each year . The organization estimates that 2 , 500 Afghan Government troops and an equal number of Soviet troops are killed each year. // In interviews in Washington , several American officials said the current level of Soviet casualties could be easily sustained by the Soviet Union . They maintained that only a higher level of military and political attrition would induce the Russians even to consider a withdrawal. // Proponents of increased military aid for the rebels marshal a series of arguments to support their view . They say the Russians must be forced to bring in more troops , which , they said , would bring a higher level of fighting that would in turn lead to an increase in Soviet casualties. // That , they said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Soviet Union and would attract more international attention . The objective would be to increase sympathy for the Afghan cause so that more nations would be willing to link the withdrawal of Soviet troops with a settlement of unrelated issues , such as a reduction in nuclear arms. // There are many who disagree , including scholars who have studied the Soviet Union and politicians and journalists in India and Pakistan . They say a forced withdrawal from Afghanistan , and the abandonment of a Communist ally , is unthinkable because of the example this would set in Eastern Europe and even in the Moslem republics of Soviet Central Asia. // And they say increased American visibility would make the Afghan war seem like nothing more than an extension of the superpower conflict , providing additional justification for India and other third-world countries to remain neutral. // There are also those who strongly oppose any linkage that would make it more difficult to negotiate with the Russians on nuclear arms . <> <> Ready for a Lifetime of War // But this is all part of a debate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebels and their supporters . The rebels say victory can come only at the point of a gun . They appear psychologically prepared for a lifetime of war . With or without more help , they say they have no doubt of the outcome. // Abdul Haq , a general commander of rebel forces in the Kabul area , summed up the situation this way : // " The Arabs share our religion , but they are busy with the Palestine and Israeli problems and the war between Iran and Iraq. // " The Western countries are far away and have different languages , cultures and systems of government . So there is no one really behind us . No matter . If someone helps us , we say yes and take the help . If someone does not help we do not care . We will do what we should do. " // If only one rebel is left alive , a young soldier said in a separate interview as he sat with his comrades in a cave in the Jegdalek Valley , south of Kabul , he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " will keep on fighting.
