A self-exam for cancer <P> Each month millions of women check their breasts for suspicious lumps in an effort to detect cancer early . Now doctors are urging men to perform a monthly self-examination of their own , this one aimed at cancer of the testicle . <P> The disease , though rare , is occurring with greater frequency . In the past 40 years , the incidence of reported cases has almost doubled in the U.S. Today it affects about four of every 100,000 men annually ; an estimated 4,000 new cases are diagnosed each year . Once found primarily in older men , it now is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 20 and 34 , causing 9% of all male cancer deaths in that age group . <P> No one knows why testicular cancer is increasing-or indeed why it strikes . It appears most frequently among white middle-and upper-class men . Two groups run 40 times the normal risk of developing the disease : men with a testicle that failed to descend from the abdominal cavity into the scrotum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetus ; and men with a testicle that descended only after they were six years old . Preliminary studies suggest that undescended testicles may be more frequent in boys born to women who received the hormone diethylstilbestrol , or DES , during pregnancy . The hormone was widely prescribed in the 1940s and 1950s to help prevent miscarriage . <P> Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco are beginning a three-year study of 250 patients with the disease to explore the connection with DES as well as other possible influences , including race , social class , on-the-job exposure to chemicals , even the type of underwear favored . One theory holds that men who wear tight shorts run a greater risk of developing the disease . <P> Although testicular cancer used to be regularly fatal , it is now often curable . Treatment may involve surgery , radiation and/or a combination of drugs , most notably cisplatin , which was first used experimentally only a decade ago . Even in severe cases , more than half the patients are cured . When the disease is detected early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say physicians , is the best way to find the disease early . The exam should be performed after a warm bath or shower , when the scrotal skin is most relaxed . The telltale sign is a lump the size of a pea . Doctors caution that a lump does not necessarily mean cancer , but it should be reported promptly to a physician and checked .
