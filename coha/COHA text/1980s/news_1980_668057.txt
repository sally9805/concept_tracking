DEER LAKE , Pa. - Monday morning Muhammad Ali arose with the sun , although there was some question as to which act occasioned the other . He is the greatest , after all . His greatness is immense , intergalactic , cosmic . The sun , well , it will burn out some day . But Ali - never . His pursuit of a fourth heavyweight championship began at dawn . The pursuit of his pursuers - his fans and press - had begun in darkness . In the parking lot of his rustic training camp , three early 20ish men who had driven through the night from New Jersey sat sipping beer , waiting for his appearance . A television crew from Scranton also waited . So it shall ever be for Ali . He moves in people , around them , through them , and always with them . Whether they be 300,000 Chinese in Peking , or three half-stewed New Jersey kids at dawn , Ali plays to them . This particular morning , Ali was in top form . No , not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop on a three- mile run . His magic show was wonderful , however . " I got to do something to break the boredom of training , " said Ali , inviting the Jersey boys , the TV crew and his bodyguard Rahaman into the small office adjoining the gym . There were tricks with ropes , cards , coins , and handkerchiefs . Ali has a caseful of props and a well-practiced routine , complete with stage banter . The Jersey Boys were willing dupes . Ali stripped off his soggy sweatshirt for his performance and was bare to the waist . Those recent pictures of his belly were no exaggeration . It is full blown and chaotic . Noting this , one of the Jersey Boys whispered out of Ali ' s hearing , " I ' d like to see him make his gut dissappear . " Wouldn ' t Ali love that ? Now you see it , now you don ' t . Too bad . Lana Shabazz is on intimate terms with Ali ' s famous belly . She feeds it , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves leach-like to Ali ' s grocery bill . Lana Shabazz is a celebrity in her own right - her cookbook is on the stands and her benign face has been seen on several talk shows . Her kitchen , with the big nine-burner stove , is always bustling . " I ' m not worried about Ali , " said Lana . " He is no trouble to feed , really . I ' ve been giving him a lot of steaks and chops and vegetables . He ' s laying off the bread and potatoes . And desserts . Although Ali , you know , he loves the desserts . " At breakfast , the Scranton television crew filmed Lana serving Ali a plate of three scrambled eggs and toast . Ali thought this rather dull , so he said to Lana , " Where ' s the cake and donuts , Lana Shabazz ? " " You know you can ' t have no cake and donuts , Ali . " " Who says I can ' t have no cake and donuts ? Who is paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreated from the table . Later , the television crew let Ali watch its video playback . There was Lana giggling as she stood over her chop board . Ali sat mesmerized and watched the entire playback , wearing the earphones to hear himself . One of his lines made him particularly happy . At the breakfast table , he had pulled out one of those large yellow legal pads . " This is my diary , " he said . " With this I will tell the world every detail of my miraculous comeback . " I got everything on here . Like here , I just wrote , " Entertained three white boys this morning . First time they ever saw a nigger do magic . " Ali ' s Method for Racial Harmony is simple and direct . Nothing is so sensitive that it can ' t be talked about . All ethnics are welcome . The world is his ministry , even if his Black Muslim religious doctrine doesn ' t quite allow for that . It is one of his most endearing contradictions . Ali ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - at age 38 - and his inability to give it up . After he beat Leon Spinks in September 1978 to regain the title for the third time , he said he wanted to go on to bigger , more important things . And so he became an American statesman and traveled to Russia , China , and the Third World . Even now , Ali refuses to admit he misses boxing . This question was put to him after his afternoon workout . " I ' m in trouble if I can ' t live without boxing , " he said . " I got ta stop soon . I enjoy the getting there and winning , but not the training . " Bundini Brown , the combination shaman-adviser who has been with Ali for longer than he can remember , believes Ali ' s actions and not , in this case , his words . " He never will admit it , that ' s him , " said Bundini . " But he ' s back . So why ask that man if he missed boxing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s hitting the heavy bag . " He had to miss it , because that was what God gave him to do . He gave him that - boxing - as a stop , look and listen sign , and then he be able to give love to the people and bring them together . " The workouts - the ones Ali claims to hate - don ' t appear to inflict hardship on him . His gym is open to the public , folding chairs are set up , and there he is , on stage again . How many boxers are applauded for doing three minutes on the heavy bag ? He drew more applause Monday when he sparred with a young welterweight and middleweight to hone his rusty defensive skills . " These boys are 10 times as fast as Weaver , and you see how hard it is for them to hit me , " Ali announced . After the sparring , Ali sat on a stool in the ring and answered questions . " Do you have a prediction on Weaver , champ ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I promise to whup Weaver . " The rhyme seemed to please Ali . The day had gone well . The papers weren ' t signed - and maybe still aren ' t - but Ali talked as if his fight with Mike Weaver , the WBA champion , were a foregone conclusion . " It ' s in Brazil , " he whispered confidentially . He slipped a figure of $7.7 million - his purse - into the conversation . The public had been entertained , and now he reclined on the sofa in the little office that had been the site of the magic show . Ali tried to explain why he feels perfectly capable of fighting again , and why he isn ' t listening to the doctors - including his former physician Ferdie Pacheco - who claim he is foolish to risk his health . " Some people call it a risk because their reason and logic clash with my goal , " he said . " It ' s an easy fight . This man ( Weaver ) is easy . I see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tate beat him - and just got hit . How am I going to lose ? " On a scale of 10 , I ' m a 9 1/2 , and Weaver is about a 6 . He hasn ' t had enough experience , his reflexes are not really fast , and he doesn ' t have much speed and intelligence . You ever hear him talk ? The only way he talks is slow . He ' s as dumb as Joe Frazier . " Don ' t tell me about his left hook . It ' s not as hard as Frazier ' s or Shavers ' or Foreman ' s . And I am known for taking a punch better than any heavyweight who ever lived . Ain ' t that right , Rahaman ? " That ' s right , Ali . " " If Weaver ain ' t careful , " Ali continued , " the most dangerous time in his life will be between the time he beat Tate and the time he ' s boxing me . " He ' ll feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me real quick . When I was young , I fought Archie Moore , Lavorante , Doug Jones , Alonzo Johnson , and then Liston . Weaver , he jumps right on Ali . " Then there ' s the night clubs , the parties , the limousines . He ' s got to turn all that down , and it takes years to turn that down . It took me a long time to turn that down - that ' s how I lost the first Frazier fight , and the first Norton fight . I was still in my glory and partying too much . " And then he ' s gon na say , I ' m not going to run today , or I ' m not going to run that hard . This Ali , he ' s an old man ; he ' s shot . I ' m 27 , he ' s 38 ; I canwhup him . ' " Never far from Ali ' s mind is his age , and the uniqueness it lends his enterprise . True to form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old age is only the record of one ' s whole life , " he said . " Who said that ? " he was asked . " I did . That ' s my saying . " " Do you worry about growing old ? " " No I don ' t , and here ' s why . I got eight beautiful children - seven daughters and one son - and just to see them growing up is worth living for . To see them going to school and getting married . " All of life can be good . When I ' m an old man I ' ll be able to look at the record books and watch the young boys try to break my records . " The record book - a place in history - Ali insists , is what this comeback is all about . " Nothing like going down with a good name in history , " said Ali . " I want to go down as the greatest athlete in the history of the world . I know Babe Ruth was great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I win the heavyweight title four times , I am not only great , I am inhuman .
