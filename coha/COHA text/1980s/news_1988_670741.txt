One is a " Dear Paul " letter from Mario Cuomo , written shortly after the Governor appointed Paul T. Gentile to the position in December 1987 . It includes this assertion : " I have no doubt that the correctness of my selection will be reaffirmed over and over again in the years to come. " // Mr. Gentile , who took over when Mario Merola died after 15 years in office , is about to enter his last week as District Attorney . He is a career prosecutor whose attempts to remain in the Bronx office sputtered last summer in a venomous primary campaign and collapsed when Democratic leaders in the borough withdrew their support for him and endorsed Robert T. Johnson , a former prosecutor and Criminal Court judge . He went on to win the election and will take over on Jan. 1. // // Uncertain Future // Mr. Gentile is now concerned about his future ; he said he does not know what he will do after he leaves office . But he is also wondering about the past year , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping that people will look back and say that in that difficult period , he got the ship through the storm , " Mr. Gentile said this week in an interview. // " Maybe the captain got thrown overboard , " he added , " but the ship got through. " // Mr. Gentile will have served for a little more than 14 months . He was the chief assistant in the office when he became acting District Attorney on Oct. 27 , 1987 , the day Mr. Merola died suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage . He then went through a selection procedure and was officially appointed to the post by Governor Cuomo . <> <> Doubts About a Judgeship // Mr. Gentile ' s legacy has not yet been fully defined , but even he concedes that his stewardship will probably be remembered in tandem with a political campaign that was remarkably bitter . He also concedes that the fallout from that election has made it highly unlikely that he will realize his desire to be appointed a judge - something that most retiring district attorneys , particularly a 45-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little doubt that Mr. Gentile ' s legacy will be far different from that of Mr. Merola , who dominated the office with his bluster and swagger and who never had any trouble getting the people of the Bronx to re-elect him. // And it will not be surprising if Mr. Gentile ' s time in office becomes obscured . Lawyers and judges in the art deco Bronx County Courthouse are already anticipating the arrival of Mr. Johnson , who will become the first black district attorney in New York State . Mr. Johnson has called the racial milestone he achieved both " historic " and " long overdue. " // Mr. Gentile remains the District Attorney until the first of the year , and until then , he said , he is " running full speed ahead . " But most of his staff is not ; lawyers there usually take a holiday during what is historically one of the slowest times of the year at the courthouse. // In the last few weeks , Mr. Gentile has achieved a measure of respect that eluded him for much of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations of corruption in several Bronx school boards brought him headlines for something other than election foibles . He held a series of well-attended news conferences , and reporters from as far away as Montreal and Los Angeles called him for comment . In November he said he expected indictments " soon , " but he said this week that it appeared doubtful there would be any before Jan. 1 . <> <> Indictments Are Up // By some standards his stewardship could be seen as a competent one . In the first 11 months of the year , the office handled a record number of criminal indictments - 8 , 730 , up by almost 500 from the same period the previous year . Among the cases that went to a jury trial , the office had a slightly higher conviction rate , 59 percent , than in the last 10 months of Mr. Merola ' s service , according to the State Office of Court Administration. // And Mr. Gentile said he thought certain steps he had taken - including the establishment of a bias unit and programs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hailed as wise ideas. // Still , in the long run , the question of what Mr. Gentile actually did in office may prove less intriguing than why he failed to hold onto his position . When he backed out of the race last June , Mr. Gentile explained that it was simply because he was a " terrible politician . " There were few who disputed that. // In the interview this week , he said that in his 10 years as the chief assistant in the Bronx office , he had constantly explained to his friends why he would never try for the top job . " The step between number one and number two is a mile , " he said he told them . " It ' s political . It ' s elected . " <> <> Two Competed but Neither Won // Even when he became the acting top prosecutor , there was no certainty that Governor Cuomo would keep him in the office . He vied with Philip F. Foglia , a top attorney in the Bronx office who by almost all accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hostility from that competition later boiled over in the primary campaign , with each man campaigning as the rightful heir to Mr. Merola and neither winning. // Amid allegations that Mr. Gentile had trouble knocking down - including charges that he used office funds for campaign purposes and misstated the number of times he had been married - he faltered . The fatal blow was an exchange with the United States Attorney , Rudolph W. Giuliani , who accused Mr. Gentile of leaking unverified reports from an old F.B.I. file that linked Mr. Foglia to the mafia. // Mr. Gentile was never formally charged with wrongdoing , and an investigation by the special state prosecutor , Charles J. Hynes , determined that he broke no laws . But the whole episode - including Mr. Giuliani ' s characterizations of him as a " sneaky creep " and a " pathetic jerk " - served to discredit him and create the impression that he was unfit for office . With politicians fleeing him , he left the race. // Asked now whether he could have done anything to head off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I don ' t know . I don ' t know . " <> <> Photo of Giuliani // In any event , he said , he is trying to concentrate on the positive aspects of his tenure and to bear no grudges . One of the framed mementos on the office wall is a photograph of him at a dinner seated next to Mr. Giuliani. // Although Mr. Gentile stops being District Attorney on Jan. 1 , he will have one more month in office , helping Mr. Johnson with the transition . Mr. Gentile might well have remained in the number two job for all of his professional life , but his unexpected thrust into the number one position has ultimately left him with no position at all. // That situation , he said , is " one of life ' s little ironies , " but then he shrugged and denied having any regrets . " So somebody asks , ' Are you glad you did it ? ' The answer is yes . Being District Attorney was and is , as far as your adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live that out. " //
