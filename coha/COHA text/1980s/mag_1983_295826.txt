There is plenty to cheer in Kate Nelligan ' s acting in Plenty <P> The way most actors tell it , success is the Holy Grail , achieved only after pain , struggle and years spent waiting on tables between auditions . Kate Nelligan , on the other hand , has to think of other conversational gambits . To her the Grail came parcel post , wrapped in bright holiday paper and crowned with a bow the size of a best-acting award . She has , in short , never had to pant after a part and rarely received so much as an unkind word from a reviewer . What she has experienced is the acclaim of the London critics , and after her new play , David Hare 's Plenty , opened off-Broadway in October , almost embarrassingly ecstatic reviews in New York as well . <P> This week , when Plenty opens at Broadway 's Plymouth Theater , there will doubtless be more gushing . Though the play has flaws , Nelligan seemingly has none . Her performance is so unique , mesmerizing and shattering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else in the role . She plays Susan Traherne , who as a girl of 17 was dropped behind German lines in France to work as a British courier . The character is never able to recapture the purity of her wartime zeal . As the play follows her through the next 20 years , shifting backward and forward through time , her personality hardens into madness , and she brings ruin not only to herself but her husband , who is movingly played by Edward Herrmann . <P> " It 's a great role , " says Nelligan . <P> " Susan has great power and is one of the most truly glamorous characters in the world , very sexy but saying to the world , ' If you touch me , I 'll kill you . ' Four years ago , when I was 27 and doing the part in London , I overplayed the power . I now allow more light in the power and permit myself early scenes . You tend to carry things lighter as you get older . " <P> One of the keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose Public Theater brought Plenty to the U.S. , is her " tremendous self-confidence , " and that , apparently , is something she has always had . Brought up in London , Ont. , where her father worked for the city parks system , she seems to have been bottle-fed selfesteem . " There were six children , " she says . " But my mother always made me feel that I would do something important , which stood me in good stead . " She can not remember a time when she did not work hard , and when she was only 16 , she entered the University of Toronto . That is where she discovered the theater . <P> As Nelligan describes it , there was no flash of light when she first stood on a stage , no epiphany or dreams of glory . Just the opposite : she was comfortable . " I did n't feel elated or ecstatic , just at home . " She wanted to stay in such a pleasant place-the theater , that is . In her second year , she auditioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was seeing applicants at Yale . She was accepted , but then ran into a problem : insufficient funds .
