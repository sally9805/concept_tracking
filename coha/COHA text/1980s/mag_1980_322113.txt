New movement in the hostage crisis , but no breakthrough yet <P> Two short , unshaven young men in blue jeans and olive-drab flak jackets walked up to the door of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini 's modest house in the Tehran suburb of Jamaran . They were immediately ushered inside . The two visitors had been mere university freshmen until a year ago . On Nov. 4 , 1979 , they joined an estimated 500 other militants in seizing and occupying the U.S. embassy . Now , while their comrades downtown were preparing to celebrate the first anniversary of the siege , the two young men were reporting to Khomeini to elicit his " guidance " about the vote by the Majlis , or Iranian parliament , setting conditions for the release of the hostages . <P> After almost three hours , Khomeini , accompanied by his son Ahmed , emerged and went next door to a half-completed mosque , where he frequently holds court in a cushioned , blue-draped chair on a balcony . Other students were already gathered there , segregated by sex , according to strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allahu Akbar " ( God is great ) and holding aloft Khomeini portraits . One of the militants stepped forward and read a prepared text . The Majlis decision , it declared , " does not mean the end of the conflict with America . As our Imam has said , we shall fight against world-devouring America until we die . " <P> But then , couched in the familiar rhetoric of revolution , came the declaration that many in the U.S. had been waiting and hoping for : the militants would turn the hostages over to the Iranian government . The students said they wanted to march off to the battlefront and help defend Iran against " America 's puppet , " Iraq . Said the militants ' spokesman : " If the great leader of the revolution grants us permission , we will from now on delegate the responsibility for the safeguarding of the hostages to the government and will engage in the most important current issue of the revolution , defense of the Islamic homeland . " For his part , Khomeini lavished praise on the militants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have destroyed the myth of U.S. invincibility . I do n't have the words to thank you . May God reward you for your service . " But during his private meeting with the two militants earlier , Khomeini had formally endorsed the transfer : " It is a correct move to delegate the issue to the government . " <P> That order , followed by the ritual on the mosque balcony , made possible the first step in the hostages ' long , still treacherous journey home . Iran demanded a quick U.S. reply to the conditions set by the Majlis . Administration experts , however , were not about to speed up their painstaking consideration of the Iranian demands . Secretary of State Edmund Muskie warned that " the process . . . will require time , patience and diplomacy . "
