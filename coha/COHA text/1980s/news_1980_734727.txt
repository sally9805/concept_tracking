txt In these days of increased consumer awareness , who would order a product sight unseen , selling for an undetermined price and made by a company that has spent much of the past year hovering near bankruptcy ? William Power of West Bloomfield Township . Mich .. did , and he 's proud of it . The product is a 1981-model Plymouth Reliant compact car ; he put a $100 deposit on it in mid-July . It did n't bother him that Chrysler Corp . was a month away from producing its first Reliant or that the price he was quoted was a vague $6,000 to $7,000 . " That 's a little more than I thought it would be , but if that 's what they think its worth , then that 's what it 's worth , " he says . Buyers Galore Other people around the country apparently think the same way . Last week , when Chrysler rolled its first front-wheel-drive " K " - car off the assembly line here , it claimed enough wholesale dealer orders to fill its production schedule through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial buyers to equal a second month 's output . No one knows how many of the cars headed for dealers are already spoken for by retail customers like Mr. Power . But it is more than a few , and the number is growing . " Our business was running slower than the Pigeon River , " says Frances Pettit , an owner of Pettit Dodge Inc. in Waynesville , N. C. Thanks to the " K " - car , she says , " now we have a lot more lookers " to try to convert into buyers . Advance orders from people eager to buy a car nobody else owns yet are n't unusual in Detroit ; a couple of times in recent years , General Motors Corp . was even besieged with orders for certain high-priced , specialized models it was still trying to keep secret . But the " K " - cars are n't rare sports cars or luxurious rolling ego trips aimed at the wealthy . They 're small , bread-and-butter family sedans that will be built in volume for Everyman . More important , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are products of an auto maker that may be the world 's shakiest . The company is on its way to a $1 billion loss this year , and it 's keeping 1981 Plymouth Reliant its doors open with government-backed borrowed money . What 's more , it has n't tried to hide the fact that it must sell a lot of " K " - cars to survive . But that 's precisely why some people are placing early , blind orders . Mr. Power , who retired from Chrysler in 1971 after 38 years as a skilled tradesman there , is buying a Reliant to help his former employer : " They were good to me , so I figure I should be good to them , " he says . He also thinks his purchase may help several friends at Chrysler keep their jobs . The pleas of Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca in television ads persuaded Mrs. VerGene Golden , a Lonona , Wis. , homemaker , to plunk down a deposit for a " K " - car station wagon " with all the extras . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard and makes it seem that so much is at stake " that she decided to lend him a hand . She and her husband , a plumbing contractor , were particularly impressed that the pitch came straight from the chairman . Hopes Abound Does she ever worry that Chrysler will go out of business and make her new car an orphan ? " That bothers me to an extent , " she concedes , but " these days you just want something you can put your faith in . We 're hoping that the car will be an outstanding product . " Eldon Walter , a Kansas City , Mo. , accountant , was also nervous about Chrysler 's precarious state at first , but now he figures that " if something happened to Chrysler , that would be a prime opportunity for somebody else to set up a business servicing its cars . " He still has n't committed himself to buy a " K " - car because he thinks he might save money by buying a left-over 1980-model Chrysler . ( Chrysler recently confirmed the new compacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's weakening : " I can afford a new car , so it 's a question of whether my ego is big enough to want the mystique " of owning a " K " - car while it is still novel . he says . For Clarence Folk , a retired Pittsburgh steelworker , it 's a matter of patriotism . He wants better mileage than his 1979 Plymouth Volare is delivering but would never own a foreign car . So three months ago , he says , he told a local dealer he wanted a " deluxe " Aries station wagon , the Dodge version of the " K " - car . The dealer promised me the first one on the lot would be mine , " Mr. Folk says . While many Chrysler dealers seem willing  --  if not thrilled  --  to take advance orders from people like Mr. Folk , some , surprisingly , are n't . Robert Lam , business manager at Dodge City U.S.A. in Topeka , Kans. , is one of them . He reports some 30 inquiries a week about the new models . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many cars we 'll get , and we do n't want a whole lot of folks mad at us . " A Texas dealer who is also spurning early orders figures that he 'll be able to sell the first " K " - cars he gets right off the lot , anyway . That attitude has irritated some would-be buyers elsewhere . Patricia Sikes , a Colorado Springs homemaker , says she and her husband were attracted to the cars ' front-wheel-drive feature to help them scale 11,000-foot. snowy mountain passes when they go skiing . Yet , rather than work out a sale . Mrs. Sikes says , a dealer they visited made clear that if they did n't take a " K " - car on his terms , someone else would . " We were given the distinct impression that there was going to be very little ' dealing ' on these cars , " she says . " It seems they intend to soak every penny out of them . We are n't going to be pressured into buying an over-priced automobile . " The dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first year is n't the key to success , " notes a Detroit Chrysler dealer . " People always want something new , and they do n't care if it is good , bad , pretty or ugly . The second-year response will be the real indicator . "
