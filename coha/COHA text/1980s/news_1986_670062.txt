At MCI Communications Corp. , marketing once meant grabbing home telephone users . The pitch was for low-priced long-distance service ; the medium was often TV . The idea was to get people to dial toll-free numbers and sign up . Now MCI and its competitors are seeking more-sophisticated customers : big corporations . The shift makes sense . Most residential users have already chosen a long-distance company , in " equal-access " elections after the break-up of American Telephone &; Telegraph Co . Also , big businesses generate more than half of all revenue from long-distance calls . But wooing corporate users is tough , especially for MCI . It could run into more trouble than its rivals because its previous strategy of stressing low prices for residential customers  --  often ignoring business users  --  worked well . " The large user is cynical and skeptical about MCI , " says Howard Anderson , the president of Yankee Group , a Boston consulting firm . To change that perception , Washington-based MCI has recruited heavily to build a 400-member group of sales and technical people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their predecessors . Their mission is to build long-term relationships with corporate customers and to develop products for these " national accounts . " To win more business from big users , MCI believes it must help customers plan communications strategy . By contrast , MCI ' s sales people used to employ what one MCI official calls an " Avon-lady " approach  --  ringing doorbells , selling a few long-distance lines and then disappearing . " The old approach was very hit and run , rape and pillage , go out and make a sale without any real concern for the needs of the client , " says Rennie Crabtree , an Annapolis , Md. , consultant who developed a two-week training course for MCI ' s new national accounts group . AT &; dominates the big-business market , with an estimated 95% share . MCI , while starting out as a supplier of private-line service to business customers , until recently seemed content with a tiny portion of the market . Instead it focused on building its network and winning residential accounts . Its commercial-sales people got their kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCI takes a longer view . In training sessions , national accounts team members learn how to work with customers by acting out case studies . When they play salesman , they must diagnose the customers ' problems and devise solutions . All the while , they dote on details such as shaking hands and knowing where the light switches are before making slide presentations . They practice teamwork by playing volleyball and trivia games . A new compensation plan reinforces the approach . Account executives are rewarded for , say , meeting with senior executives of target companies or developing services requested by customers . Jonathan Crane , MCI ' s vice president of national accounts , wants customers to view his salesmen as partners who solve problems . In California recently , MCI modified a contract with Security Pacific National Bank , forgoing some short-term revenue for sake of a long-term relationship . To forge closer ties with customers , MCI is also doing more entertaining . On Super Bowl Sunday , it gave a brunch for key customers , who gathered at its Denver office to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Customers have been treated to balloon rides . The company also has been entertaining clients at professional golf tournaments  --  a perk associated with its sponsorship of a " long-distance-driving " contest . MCI got a big boost in February when it acquired Satellite Business Systems , a high-tech carrier , from International Business Machines Corp . MCI gained , among other things , the capability to offer satellite-based videoconferencing and data transmission . And IBM , which became MCI ' s biggest shareholder ( with an almost 17% stake ) , now is its biggest customer and a powerful ally . With its new high-tech offerings just starting to reach the marketplace , MCI looks for rapid growth in corporate accounts . It expects national accounts by 1990 to generate 50% of MCI revenue . Last year big users accounted for 7% or 8% of MCI ' s $2. 54 billion in revenue . This year the level may reach 10% . But to succeed MCI now must deliver on its promises . That will require developing even-more-advanced products for voice and data transmission  --  a formidable task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , " says Mr. Anderson of Yankee Group . " They ' re rookies . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
