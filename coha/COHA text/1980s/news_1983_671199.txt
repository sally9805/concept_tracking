But all this seems as temporary as the dreary weather that has beset usually sun-baked Arizona for much of this season . New statistics from the Census Bureau ' s computer tapes indicate that Phoenix , despite its current troubles , is , in fact , fat city when compared with a Cleveland or a Baltimore , and that it is not alone . Other growing cities in the West and South , the figures show , are undergirded by prosperity and stability that sets them even further apart from the old cities of the Northeast and Middle West than has been generally believed . <> <> Poorer Cities , Richer Suburbs // Findings of the 1980 census show that the country ' s central cities have been becoming poorer and their suburbs richer , and that there are also marked differences in living habits , households , employment , age and other characteristics between people who live within cities ' limits and those in outlying areas. // Yet those differences are not nearly as great as are the disparities between the central cities in this region and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South and West now appear to be doing significantly better than large cities in the North in a number of categories , including income , employment and racial patterns. // For several years , it has been apparent that the larger cities in the Northeast and Middle West have been losing population , while the Southern and Western cities have been gaining. // In addition to confirming these population shifts , the new statistics give the first detailed information on important changes occurring with them . An analysis of this information as it pertains to the country ' s 22 largest cities and their suburbs - 11 in the North and 11 in the South and West - showed the following trends : // - A growth in household income from 1970 to 1980 for cities in the South and West , compared with a decline for cities in the North. // - A big loss of blue-collar employment over the decade for the Northern cities but a substantial gain for cities in the South and West . The Sun Belt cities also had a greater increase in white-collar and service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northern cities , but a higher percentage of both blacks and Hispanic people in suburbs in the South and West . In other words , Southern and Western suburbs were more accessible to minorities than suburbs in the North . <> <> A Matter of Debate // The regional differences between large urban areas have been a subject of national debate for some time . The issue is considered important not only for measuring the quality of life in American cities but also for establishing national policies for the distribution of public funds. // The Reagan Administration argued in its national urban policy report , submitted to Congress last year , that overall regional differences were declining and the states were more capable of assuming additional responsibilities for cities than they were 25 years ago , when the burden began shifting to the Federal Government. // At the same time , high Administration officials have acknowledged that some of the regional disparities are greater now than they have ever been in the past , and in a number of respects the big cities fall into that category. // The 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the analysis of census information provided a fairly even division for drawing comparisons . For example , New Orleans and San Francisco in the Sun Belt , both of which are old , with close-in boundaries , share many of the characteristics of Northern cities . In the North , Columbus , Ohio , and Indianapolis , with low population density and declining dependence on heavy industry , are like Sun Belt cities in some respects . <> <> Shift in Blue-Collar Work // One of the most dramatic differences for the regions was in employment . In the Northern cities , the number of people in bluecollar jobs , which in the past have provided entry into the labor force for the poor , declined by 1. 64 million from 2. 675 million , in the years 1970 to 1980 . This 63 percent loss was far higher than the cities ' population decline . The Southern and Western cities , however , gained 253 , 000 blue-collar employees , a 22 percent increase over the 1 , 171 , 000 they had in 1970 . Nationally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed an even larger gain , 37 percent , in white-collar employment , which in recent years has become the predominant part of the central city labor force in all regions . The Northern cities , by contrast , had a 3 percent loss. // In other areas , the 1980 census found household income almost $2 , 000 higher on the average in the Southern and Western cities . And differences in personal income between the cities and suburbs was much less in Southern and Western cities than in the North. // As for poor minorities , the Northern cities had the larger share of blacks ; Southern and Western cities had the larger share of Hispanic people , who are higher on the income scale than blacks . <> <> Decline of Cities // In a recent study on regional trends , Allan C. Ornstein , of Loyola University of Chicago , linked the rapid rise in black populations in Northern cities to the cities ' economic decline. // " For the 11 Frost Belt cities , " he wrote , " the median black population was 38. 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970 , 22. 9 percent in 1960 and 15 percent in 1950 . For all 11 Sun Belt cities , the median black population was only 17 percent in 1980 , compared to 10. 7 percent in 1950. " // " In general , " he continued , " the continuous exodus of much of the white population from the major cities of the Frost Belt , accompanied by restrictive policies against blacks in the adjacent suburbs , has led to a decline in the tax base and has stimulated business flight and job losses to the suburbs and Sun Belt. " // Phoenix and New York City provide a stark contrast that makes these differences more easily understood . New York has 10 times as many people as Phoenix on less land area . Its five boroughs cover 300 square miles , while Phoenix sprawls over 360 miles of desert and is still spreading . <> <> Loss of Population // From 1970 to 1980 , New York lost 10 percent of its population , while Phoenix gained by 31 percent . New York lost 25 percent of its blue-collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households had a median annual income in 1980 of $13 , 855 , less than the national average of $16 , 851 . Phoenix was above the national average . Its median household income was $17 , 419 . In New York , 38 percent of the households had incomes under $10 , 000 ; in Phoenix 26 percent did. // The suburbs of the two cities provide a different picture . In New York ' s suburbs the median household income was $23 , 740 , almost $10 , 000 more than for the city , and more than $5 , 000 above the $18 , 085 median in the Phoenix suburbs. // In New York 13. 5 percent of the people were over the age of 65 , as against 9. 6 percent in Phoenix . Blacks made up about 25 percent of New York ' s population , and Hispanic people , 20 percent ; Phoenix was 4. 9 percent black and 15. 1 percent Hispanic . Minority groups in the Phoenix area were more evenly distributed between city and suburbs . New York suburbs were 7. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 1. 4 percent black and 11. 2 percent Hispanic . <> <> Mobility of Residents // As would be expected , Phoenix had a more mobile population , despite the fact that 23. 6 percent of New Yorkers were foreign-born , as against 5. 7 percent of Phoenix ' s residents . In Phoenix 22. 5 percent of the people said they had moved from abroad or from another state in the last five years . In New York 8. 4 percent did. // And the differences go on , many of them additional signs of the differing well-being of residents in the two cities . In New York , for example , 33 percent of the households with children were headed by a single mother , as against 6. 3 percent in Phoenix . It takes New Yorkers an average of 38 minutes to get to work ; in Phoenix it takes just 22 minutes despite the great distances separating homes and businesses. // Aside from the mass migration of people and jobs from the North to the Sun Belt in recent years , a major reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cities in the South and West have been able to expand their boundaries , taking in areas previously classified as suburban . <> <> The ' St. Louis Syndrome ' // In Phoenix , annexation has been an obsession , a determination to avoid what city officials call " the St. Louis syndrome , " a reference to the fact that in the last century St. Louis decided it would never need to be larger and adopted a constitutional barrier to expansion . As a result , St. Louis is no longer among the country ' s larger cities and has been overwhelmed by its suburbs. // Throughout the 1970 ' s and into the 1980 ' s , Phoenix has warred with suburbs and ranchers for more space . It has resorted to a device of annexing very narrow strips of land that creep out and surround much larger territory in order to keep other governments out . On a map its jagged borders wear hollow , rectangular appendages . Recently , the city went around a mountain range to the south to annex new land for commercial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , said the sprawl was being attacked by new incentives to build self-contained " villages " within the city , each with jobs , housing and lower density than the city has known in the past. // Every day brings assurances of continued growth . A mortgage banker , Kenneth P. Braun , senior vice president of the Abacus Group , a banking and investment concern , predicted that Phoenix would be " one of the nation ' s major new defense and high technology centers " by the year 2000 . <> <> Some Disturbing Signs // But there are disturbing notes along with this . According to the 1980 census , poverty is spreading out of the 40-square-mile depressed area south of downtown , where most of the city ' s poor lived in 1970 . The number in poverty increased in that area , to 87 , 000 from 68 , 000 over the decade , but they no longer make up the majority of the city ' s poor . And as a result the city is planning to disperse its human resource centers to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influx of unemployed people from other regions may continue past the current recession , just as New York and other northern cities were flooded with impoverished people from the South in the 1950 ' s and 60 ' s . The daily soup lines at a shelter run by the St. Vincent de Paul Society contain refugees from New York , Cleveland , Detroit and other Northern cities who say they came here to find jobs , only to find themselves among a growing surplus of unemployed. // But this city , with its meager welfare services , is not prepared to care for poor refugees as New York and other Northern cities were in the past . While the homeless have been camping outdoors in tents and hovels and the surrounding businesses have been complaining about their presence , Mayor Margaret Hance and the City Council have been seeking ways for other levels of government to help the city care for them. // After Mayor Hance announced the appointment of a task force " to bring some light to this problem , " the state government arranged some temporary shelter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s reluctance to take on such responsibilities , said editorially : // " The task force may recommend sometime this summer that the city retain a consultant to ascertain that the homeless are really homeless and that they do indeed shiver on cold nights . After staff comment on the consultant report , the City Council may consider the matter - and table it for further consideration. " <> <>  --   --  Next : Ethnic patterns. //
