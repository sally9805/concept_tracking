It is 11 o'clock on a sparkling summer morning , and over on the Boardwalk they are already crowding into the casinos-thousands of Ali Babas in brightly colored polyesters , searching for treasure in those vast air-conditioned caves . Dice are rolling , cards are turning , and there are hands attached to most of the slot machines , which occasionally gratify with spurts of change . It is the busiest time of year in the new Atlantic City , which has high hopes of becoming the Las Vegas of the East , and the ebb and flow of the surf has given way to an even more soothing sound : great sums of money changing hands . <P> But on the front porch of Lorna Shuster 's guesthouse , where a few survivors of the old Atlantic City gather , the only thing exchanged is conversation . The name of the place is actually the Montpelier Guesthouse-it is at 7 South Montpelier Avenue-but a passerby would never know . Someone stole the sign a few weeks ago , and Shuster , whose detached , philosophical nature hides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear in a hurry to replace it . Why should she be ? Her regulars , all Jewish and all from Philadelphia , come back year after year , from the beginning of July through Labor Day , and they know where she is . " My people have been coming to Atlantic City since they were children , " she says , " long before I was here . " <P> Shuster , 48 , and her husband Nachum , 64 , an Orthodox rabbi , came from Israel and have owned the three-story house for only eight years . But by local standards that makes them oldtimers . Atlantic City 's history is conveniently divided between B.C. and A.C.-before and after the casinos . Since the first casino opened only three years ago , the Shusters are definitely B.C. , and so , of course , are their guests . They are a vanishing breed , living life slowly in a town that wants to move at top speed , watching with dismay as old landmarks give way to new parking lots and glitzy , glass-and-ormolu gaming houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 65 , who are sisters , have been summering in Atlantic City since they were in diapers . Rappaport 's husband died two years ago , but Geetie 's husband Lou , 66 , whom she met on the beach near by in 1933 , is with her now . Lou , who was born in Atlantic City , remembers walking on the girders of Convention Hall , where the Miss America contest is held , when it was being built in the late ' 20s . <P> Esther Halperin , 77 , who wears the kind of art deco glasses that curl at the sides , spent her honeymoon in Atlantic City in 1925 , at a kosher hotel on Virginia Avenue . She had two older sisters , and her parents refused to let her marry before they did , so she was forced to elope . " We only had 2 days , " she recalls . " We were married on a Tuesday , and I had to be back Friday night to light the candles . My in-laws were very religious . " Her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ago . " He loved Atlantic City , " she says sadly . Also at the Montpelier are Mildred Locke , 60 , and Bill Joblin , 64 , who are dating but have separate rooms . Through a tragic coincidence , both their spouses died of leukemia , and since they had known each other before , it seemed natural that they become friendlier .
