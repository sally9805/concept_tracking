With Hart taking two more states , the Democrats face a messy scramble <P> The political odds are still heavily in Walter Mondale 's favor . So why does he seem anxious and downhearted ? And why is Gary Hart , who still figures to be an also-ran at the San Francisco convention eight weeks from now , so full of zip and good cheer ? <P> Mondale 's malaise derives from a fact that hit home again last week : Democratic voters refuse to embrace him firmly and finally . He faces the distinct possibility that he may not amass a majority of committed delegates by the end of the primary season on June 5 , thus setting off a messy preconvention scramble that could further divide his party . Hart 's buoyant mood is understandable too . The Colorado Senator has won four of the last six primaries , including landslides last week in Nebraska and Oregon . The two outdoorsy , overwhelmingly white states were prime Hart territory , and in both he beat Mondale by 59% to 27% , giving him the largest margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hart expected to demonstrate his Western power again by winning the Idaho caucuses this week . <P> Indeed , Hart will probably finish the spring having won most of the primaries and perhaps even a majority of the cumulative popular vote . Yet Mondale still has a wide lead in total delegates ( 1,564 to 941 , as of last Saturday ) because of his victories in the big industrial states , his support from the Democratic Establishment and the arcane provisions of delegate-selection rules that his vanguard helped draft two years ago . Even if Hart should sweep the five remaining primaries on June 5 , including those in California ( 306 delegates at stake ) and New Jersey ( 107 ) , his delegate total would still be just about 1,200-well short of the 1,967 needed to nominate . Mondale at the same time would probably have 1,600 delegates who were actually elected as Mondale delegates , and another 200 who have said they support him ; he would thus be within 200 votes of nomination . The question would then be whether Mondale , coming out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates to make up that shortfall . " I think by the time of the convention , we 'll have enough delegates , " said Mondale last week , backing away from aides ' earlier predictions that he would have the needed majority just after the last primary . Countered Hart : " The Democratic Party will not nominate a candidate who loses both California and New Jersey . " <P> Although only 24 delegates were at stake in Nebraska , Hart spent five days there the week before the primary . The popular young Governor , Bob Kerrey , taped TV commercials endorsing Hart and made campaign appearances with him . Mondale whizzed through the state once , for seven hours . He lost all 93 counties to Hart . In a primary-eve speech , the winner teased his absent opponent . " I 've been traveling around here and in Oregon , and I have n't found him . Have any of you seen Mr. Mondale out here ? "                    @
