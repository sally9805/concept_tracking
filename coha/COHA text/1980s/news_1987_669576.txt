That question is coming into sharper focus as the superpower dialogue on arms control intensifies , and as Mr. Gorbachev plunges into his third year in power , seemingly bent on a major overhaul of the Soviet economy. // Kremlin watchers in the US are arguing whether a stronger , more confident , and more open Soviet Union serves American interests . They are also debating a more fundamental question : Are the reforms being touted by Gorbachev real , or merely the illusory creations of Soviet propagandists ? // // If Congress and the American public do not believe that the Soviets are serious about change , the prospects not only for arms control , but also for scientific exchanges and joint economic projects are going to be dimmed. // The debate is over how far-reaching Gorbachev ' s reforms really are - or , indeed , whether they are reforms at all . For example , does Gorbachev ' s policy of glasnost ( candor or openness ) really mean the opening of a closed society ? // And does the release from detention of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet human rights policies under Gorbachev , or is it merely a sop to Western public opinion meant to influence the arms control debate ? // The answers to those questions are assembled from the position the Soviets take on a wide variety of issues , such as the number and kinds of exchange programs they agree to , the issuance of travel or emigration visas , and the treatment of dissents. // Ambassador Steven Rhinesmith , who heads President Reagan ' s initiative to expand exchange programs with the Soviets , says , ' ' It ' s an extraordinary time in US-Soviet relations . . . The whole field of people-to-people , cultural exchanges is being used to expand the political dialogue. ' ' // But Vladimir Bukovsky , a former Soviet dissident and head of Resistance International , an activist group , warns of growing ' ' confusion ' ' being sowed by ' ' this so-called campaign of glasnost. ' ' // ' ' The Soviet authorities , ' ' he warns , ' ' want to maximize the public perception of change while giving up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchers in the US that the driving force behind glasnost is the need to reform the Soviet economy . Years of torpor were encouraged by a government lockgrip on information and by avoiding independent inquiry on such basic questions as whether the Soviet system was performing up to par. // That , according to a number of analysts , is clearly changing. // Richard Schifter , assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs , says , ' ' Things are happening in the Soviet Union that are meaningful. ' ' // But he cautions , ' ' I would be concerned that there has been too much euphoria in reaction to it. ' ' // In Mr. Schifter ' s view , changes in Soviet behavior on human rights have unquestionably benefited some individuals who have been released from prison . But he suspects the releases signaled more of a concern for Western public opinion than a rethinking of Soviet human rights policies. // ' ' I think that Gorbachev is aware that the Soviet Union has been damaged internationally by its human rights policies . He ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system. ' ' // The prime beneficiaries of glasnost appear to be the Soviet intelligentsia , who now have access to a more stimulating intellectual life with the release of previously banned books , films , and plays , and the simultaneous encouragement to critical thinking and innovation. // In particular , the release of dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov is , according to a number of Western analysts , directly tied to the goal of bolstering intellectual inquiry by demonstrating that it is now ' ' safe ' ' to question the system - within limits . And the positive publicity in the West is seen as an added bonus. // ' ' They ( the Soviet authorities ) can ' t improve economic performance or force creation of high-tech by repressive measures alone , ' ' Mr. Bukovsky says. // Bukovsky is one of a number of Soviet emigres who have been writing opinion articles for newspapers , testifying at various forums , and holding public demonstrations . Their consistent theme : The Soviet system has not changed , even though the rhetoric has. // Says Dr. Yuri Tuvim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Gorbachev ) is at least trying to start the country to work . He ' s using the bureaucracy to do this . But he ' s not introducing any single mechanism which will not permit the new bureaucracy also to become corrupt like the last one. ' ' // According to Ambassador Rhinesmith , the Soviets are now facing a ' ' delicate problem . ' ' It is , he says , ' ' how to move from control to a guided creativity. ' ' // A ' ' new attitude ' ' is apparent in Moscow , he says , which holds that ' ' the Soviet people can handle information. ' ' // Accordingly , he says , the Soviets are becoming more and more receptive to exchange programs with the US , in which ideas are shared , images are compared , and - he hopes - attitudes are changed. // Rhinesmith says the US should capitalize upon this emergent situation . ' ' In an open debate , ' ' he says , ' ' we have nothing to lose. ' ' // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Western publications are still not widely available in the Soviet Union . Although Soviet jamming of the British Broadcasting Corporation has recently stopped , jamming of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty continues. // The State Department ' s Schifter notes that , despite the release of some prominent dissidents , there has been no official admission that they were wrongly imprisoned , and no change in the repressive laws used to put them behind bars. // Some experts are arguing that the current fluidity in Soviet thinking points up the need for greater exchanges on the grass-roots level - exchanges that will encourage even more progressive steps. // There now exists a desire ' ' to be seen as more of a part of the world , ' ' not only in the Soviet Union , but in its East-bloc allies , says Stephen Hayes , director of the American Center for International Leadership , which sponsors exchanges with the Soviet Union and Hungary , among other countries. // ' ' I think they genuinely want a different type of relationship with the United States - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But is that propaganda by another name ? // Rhinesmith concedes that a recurrent theme in US-Soviet exchanges is opposition to the Reagan administration ' s plans for space-based defense systems. // But Mr. Hayes suggests that is part and parcel of the exchange of ideas . ' ' They ' re trying to influence the decisionmaking process as much as possible through their contacts . And , frankly , we are , too. ' ' // But Bukovsky and others see pitfalls ahead . ' ' The danger is that the Soviet Union is too skillful in manipulating public opinion , ' ' Bukovsky says. // ' ' The question , ' ' he says , ' ' is not how far these so-called changes will go , but how long they will continue. ' ' // He predicts that in five years , resistance to Gorbachev will solidify , disillusionment will set in , and glasnost and human rights will be forgotten. // In retrospect , he says , this period of attempted rapprochement will be seen as ' ' a temporary retreat before the next offensive. ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by becoming a more open society , they would become less of a threat militarily. ' ' // But until there is clear and convincing evidence that will happen , he says , ' ' We have to keep our guard up. ' ' // //
