" Make , movement , rarity , " says Los Angeles Lawyer Jack Quinn . " That 's what the serious collector looks for . " Muses Hans Rohrer , a computer manager in Munich : " These pieces are reverse time machines . They exude a flavor  --  even a musty smell  --  of yesterday , a bit of immortality . " Rohrer keeps all his yesterdays in a drawer at home . Quinn keeps the family immortality collection snug in a bank vault , although his journalist wife Joan has been known to wear several pieces of it , simultaneously , on her wrist . <P> After years of neglect and ignominy , including having their movements cannibalized for spare parts and their cases melted down , old wristwatches , particularly models made from the early 1920s through the ' 40s , have come into their own . Auction houses are getting " record prices " for vintage Rolexes and collectible Cartiers , according to Daryn Schnipper , a watch expert at Sotheby Parke Bernet . Sotheby 's had four major auctions in New York in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , established several new highs including a record for a 1935 Cartier Tank ( $10,000 ) . <P> It is eloquent testimony to the persistent high stylishness of premium wristwatches that jewelry shops in Milan and Paris will display a 1920s Patek Philippe , made of platinum and curved to conform to the wrist , right next to a new gold model . Antique stores in London will sell , say , a reversible Jaeger- le Coultre or a vintage Audemars Piguet , with only two small windows at the top of the solid gold case , as objets of decorative jewelry , like a piece of Lalique crystal . On the tony reaches of Madison Avenue , Watch Entrepreneur Stewart Unger last fall opened Time Will Tell , a watch boutique that sells everything from period Cartier ( a 1930 Tank at around $2,500 ) to certified Mickey Mouse watches ( $500 . ) " The demand is just about to bubble over , " predicts Edward Faber , who shows a lavish collection of oldies in his jewelry gallery off Fifth Avenue . " These watches are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on view in period movies like Chinatown and Chariots of Fire . They also show up with some regularity in fashion layouts of Giorgio Armani , Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein . The oldtimers first started to become salable , however , with the late ' 70s interest in retro clothes and in reaction to the flood of maddeningly accurate quartz and digital models available at the local pharmacy . " You can get a wafer-thin watch that keeps perfect time for $20 at a dime store , " scoffs Sig Shonholtz , who runs the Second Time Around Watch Co. in Los Angeles . " So what else is there ? The only thing left is backlash . It 's humanizing to have something quirky and mechanical on your wrist . "
