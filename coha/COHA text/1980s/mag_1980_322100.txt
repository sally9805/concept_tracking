Tom Roller 's warehouse is a monument to bureaucratic bumbling . A stroll through it stirs up visions of shattered , best-forgotten programs for the public good , and the rise and fall of federal agencies . Of course Roller does n't see it that way . He prefers to think of his 12,000-sq. - ft. warehouse on the Iowa state fairground in Des Moines as the U.S. Government 's very own garage sale . <P> Roller operates the warehouse for the surplus property division of Iowa 's department of general services for the benefit of some 1,500 public agencies in Iowa . A beneficent act of Congress requires that federal excess property be offered to state and local agencies , virtually free of charge , before it is put on public auction . That means before all those cigar-chomping characters who excel at turning a profit from reselling Government castoffs can lay hands on it . <P> At first glance the warehouse , with its mounds of gas-mask bags , ponchos , entrenching tools , field jackets , might be confused with some kind of Army-Navy store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus to equip the national guard of a modest-size Central American dictatorship . G.I. helmets and uniforms , for instance , are much in demand as props for high school drama departments . <P> Almost routinely , Roller has become arms dealer for the " Cedar Rapids Air Force . " He has snagged four UH-1B helicopters for medical evacuation use by the city . Two fly ; the others are being cannibalized for spare parts . List price for these helicopters : about $250,000 each . They cost Cedar Rapids only $10,000 , for repair and refitting . In addition , Roller has provided 17 two-seater Hughes TH-55 helicopters , some without engines , others near wrecks . Four operable craft have risen , phoenix-like , from the wrecks of the 17 . <P> But , Roller says , " when you think of Army surplus , you think of only a fraction of what the Federal Government generates . " Roaming his domain , Roller glows as he handles a 400-ft. roll of computer paper . " These are neat , " he says . " Schools can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rows of red and orange desk calendars , nameplate holders , In and Out boxes . " Somebody in the Government thought they 'd brighten up offices with these things , " explains Roller . " Now we are brightening up county clerks ' offices in Iowa . " County clerks are abandoning their 1917 Remingtons for the reconditioned electric typewriters that line the shelves of the warehouse . Roller regularly sends a truck to Washington , D.C. , where " quite serviceable typewriters " can be obtained for Iowa agencies at between $50 and $75 ( list cost when new : $200 and up ) . <P> Modern Government does not run on military and office equipment alone . Through the warehouse come potter 's wheels , musical instruments , looms , stretchers , record players , 50-lb. boxes of nails , humidity gauges , bottles of chemicals , screwdrivers and pliers of every shape and size , salt-tablet dispensers , ear slugs , potato peelers , X-ray film projectors , buckets of paint , faucets , even 59 forceps for delivering babies .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
