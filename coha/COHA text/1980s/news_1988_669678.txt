' ' Things are happening so fast to the environment . The question is whether our institutions , political processes , and values can shift quickly enough , ' ' says Lester Brown , president of Worldwatch Institute , a global environmental research and policy group. // As an example of this need , environmentalists point to predictions of an accelerated greenhouse effect - global warming - caused by the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. // // ( Scientists say EPA should focus on stopping new pollution , Page 6. ) // No one knows whether or not the greenhouse effect caused the heat wave and drought in the United States this summer . But models constructed by the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) predict that if current energy-use and production trends continue , temperatures worldwide will rise 1. 5 to 4. 5 degrees Celsius by 2030 . To postpone the effects to 2075 , lawmakers need to start thinking now about how to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , the institute says. // ' ' It could take four more years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four to enact legislation , ' ' says Irving Mintzer of WRI . Experts ' estimates of how long it would take to carry out such legislation varied from 20 to 50 years. // ' ' Societies have to cross a certain threshold of awareness and concern about an issue before there can be an effective political response , ' ' Worldwatch ' s Mr. Brown says. // It is not easy to pin down what pushes societies to that threshold . Some historians and analysts say that , in the past , people seemed to react strongly to perceived or real crises they thought would affect them directly - such as toxic waste dumps - as opposed to ' ' creeping problems , ' ' like acid rain. // ' ' One of the things we know about attentive publics is that when they personalize or identify with the risks , it ' s then that they are moved to act , ' ' says Daryl Chubin , senior analyst for the Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress. // In the 1960s and ' 70s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toxic waste that oozed up into people ' s backyards. // ' ' Our method of doing environmental protection really has depended on a crisis mentality , ' ' says Robert Rycroft , director of George Washington University ' s program in Science , Technology , and Public policy. // Partly because of the environmental movement ' s success and an increase in research being done on the environment , problems today tend to be more subtle but also potentially more damaging , analysts say . The potential impacts of acid rain , global warming , and ozone depletion stretch out over several generations . The recent stir over the greenhouse effect was triggered by the unusual heat and the drought in the US this summer . Two bills have been introduced in the US Congress to cut carbon dioxide emissions . One calls for a 20 percent reduction by 2000 , the other calls for a 50 percent reduction. // The sponsors realize both these figures may be unrealistic . But no one interviewed for this article thought public concern was deep enough to pressure lawmakers to enact costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crisis is a short-term orientation that worked in the past to environmentalists ' advantage . But I ' m not sure it does anymore , ' ' Dr. Rycroft says . ' ' Sometimes the problems stretch out too long to be able to show real crisis. ' ' // Crisis-type language hasn ' t disappeared . But parties to environmental disputes are depending increasingly on scientific research to support their positions. // ' ' That means ( environmental groups ) are having to do a little more of their own research , a better job of analyzing other people ' s research , a better job of talking about risks , ' ' Rycroft says. // The plodding pace at which scientific consensus emerges , and the often subdued effect it has on the general public and political institutions , may be no match for the rapid deterioration of ' ' spaceship earth , ' ' say some science policy specialists in their gloomier moments. // But they also are quick to cite change. // Recently , public interest in the environment and even in environmental science seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll taken in July , 65 percent of Americans polled agreed that ' ' protecting the environment is so important that requirements and standards can not be too high , and continuing environmental improvements must be made regardless of costs. ' ' // Although positive responses have been increasing since the question was first asked in 1981 , pollsters warn that this does not necessarily translate into public willingness to actually bear the costs of higher environmental standards. // Contributions to environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council are up this summer. // The Worldwatch Institute has sold more of its annual ' ' State of the World ' ' reports than ever before. // It is also selling record numbers of its more technical reports , a possible indication that more people are interested in the nitty-gritty aspects of environmental policies designed , not just for crisis-patching , but for the long term , Brown says. // ' ' The question in the ' 70s was always how to implement our ideals .
