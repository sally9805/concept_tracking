From the rim of a valley near the biblical city of Sodom on Israel 's Dead Sea , the cave of Nahal Hemar ( Hebrew for Asphalt River ) is clearly visible in the face of the opposing limestone cliff , 9 ft. above the valley floor . Over the centuries , hyenas and nomadic shepherds have used the cave for shelter , and since the 1940s discovery of the famed Dead Sea Scrolls in another cave 40 miles to the north , Bedouin shepherds have scoured through Nahal Hemar vainly seeking similar treasures . Had the Bedouins probed deeper into the cave floor , their search might have been rewarded . In 1983 Archaeologists David Alon of the Israeli Department of Antiquities and Museums and Ofer Bar-Yosef of Hebrew University , digging 3 ft. down , unearthed a cache of spectacular Neolithic ( late Stone Age ) artifacts about 9,000 years old . <P> Discovery of the finely wrought objects was kept under wraps , awaiting the beginning of the 20th anniversary celebration of Jerusalem 's Israel Museum , which last week placed them on display . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found : a life-size limestone human face decorated with bands of red and green . Also dug from the cave : basket and box fragments made of woven rushes waterproofed with asphalt , delicate thumbnail- size human heads and a rodent figurine , carved wood and bone tools , clay , stone and wooden beads and a human skull adorned with asphalt . Perhaps most remarkable are the fabrics , which are woven in eleven intricate designs , some resembling knotted macrame , others fine mesh . <P> Concerned that their Neolithic treasures would quickly disintegrate if exposed to humidity and sunlight , museum officials placed them in a darkened room , under glass and resting on a bed of blue and white silica gel that absorbs moisture . To view the objects , visitors press a button , which turns on display lights ( filtered to block any destructive ultraviolet light ) for only 90 seconds . <P> The Nahal Hemar discovery should banish forever any popular notions that Neolithic man was brutish and dull .

" These objects are so exquisite that they give us a new view of what our ancestors were like . "
