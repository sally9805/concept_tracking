For a month Ronald Reagan had been playing something of an unaccustomed role : the overanxious suitor . At nearly every opportunity , he betrayed his eagerness to meet with his Soviet counterpart . Two days after Mikhail Gorbachev was named Soviet Communist Party leader , Reagan invited him to a tete-a-tete in the U.S. The President 's desire did not diminish even after a Soviet guard shot and killed a U.S. officer in East Germany . Said Reagan in a Washington Post interview following the shooting : " I want a meeting even more so , to sit down and look someone in the eye . . . to make sure nothing of this kind happens again . " <P> His attitude dismayed much of the U.S. foreign policy establishment , moderates as well as hard-liners . Declared former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski : " This posture is disadvantageous and in bad taste . It is undesirable for us to be pleading for a summit with them . " Privately , some of Reagan 's senior advisers agreed . They suspected that Gorbachev 's coyness about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was setting up a snare instead . <P> On the symbolic day of Easter Sunday , Gorbachev made his move . In an interview with Pravda , he announced a freeze on Soviet deployment of intermediate-range missiles in Europe until November and invited the U.S. to do the same . He also proposed a freeze on strategic offensive arms and a moratorium on the development of space weapons while arms negotiations are under way in Geneva . Almost as an aside , he mentioned that both powers had expressed " a positive attitude " toward a summit . " Confrontation , " Gorbachev said , " is not an inborn defect of our relations . " <P> In one stroke , Gorbachev had taken the arms talks public and implied that a summit was linked to progress in Geneva . The warm words from Washington , it seemed , had only brought another Soviet negotiating gambit . Gorbachev had timed the announcement for maximum effect . It coincided with antinuclear demonstrations in Europe and came on the eve of a visit by a U.S. congressional delegation . It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands , the one NATO country still deciding whether to install U.S. missiles . If the Dutch proceed , deployment would begin Nov. 1 ; Gorbachev 's unilateral moratorium on SS-20 missiles , naturally enough , is in effect until November . <P> The Administration reacted with annoyance . Snapped White House Spokesman Larry Speakes : " At first blush , the proposal for a moratorium seems to revive prior Soviet efforts designed to freeze in place a considerable Soviet advantage . " The Soviets have deployed some 414 triple-warhead medium-range SS-20 missiles , two-thirds of which are aimed at Europe , while NATO has installed only 104 of the 572 single-warhead cruise and Pershing II missiles that it hopes to put in by 1988 . Paul Nitze , Reagan 's special adviser on arms control , said Moscow 's new proposal was worse from the American standpoint than the final Soviet position before the breakoff of the Geneva talks in November 1983 . Back then , the U.S.S.R. would have kept only 120 SS-20s in Europe , while the U.S. would have deployed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Soviets have developed a successor to the SS-20 , making the old missile expendable . Said one Administration aide : " They 're just offering to stop what they were going to stop anyway . "
