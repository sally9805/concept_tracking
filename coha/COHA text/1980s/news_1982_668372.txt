One of the nagging worries about television - ask any parent - is that it withers the desire to read , especially in children . No doubt about it , what we read and how much we read are affected somehow by television . The medium is no more than 30 years old , and already as influential a part of our culture as work , school or church . Yet we ' re still unsure about how it alters our lives , including our reading habits . Often television deters us from books . On the other hand , sometimes it stimulates us to read . In 1977 , for example , an esteemed bit of literature was broadcast on public television : " I Claudius , " by Robert Graves . Prior to the telecast , sales of the book , for the most part , were limited to college campuses , where professors appended it to those infernal lists of required reading that plagued us all as students . Within four weeks after the introduction of " I , Claudius , " the series , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was at the top of the best- seller lists for paperback fiction in the United States , and as Alistair Cooke , host of Masterpiece Theatre , put it , that can not be a bad thing . Now , five years after its introduction on public television , " I , Claudius " returns on commercial television this week as WSBK-TV ( Channel 38 ) in Boston presents the entire 13-hour series over six consecutive nights , beginning Monday at 8 o ' clock . " I , Claudius " stars John Hurt , Brian Blessed , and , in the title role , the British actor , Derek Jacobi , who has delivered stunning performances in the past two years on American television , first as Hamlet and then as Hitler in " Inside the Third Reich . " Let ' s begin , though , by addressing the most conspicuous features of " I , Claudius , " the sex and violence . There are now three versions of " I , Claudius . " The original and spiciest was shown in England in 1975 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pregnant sister , slavering over gobs of the murdered embryo , a surprising lapse in British good taste . The version broadcast on PBS was edited a bit more to reduce the sex and violence , and the third version , which will be shown this week , has been edited even further to make it more acceptable for syndication on commercial television , although there remain scenes violent and sexual enough to worry not only the Rev. Donald Wildmon , but also executives at Ch. 38 . Ten days ago , they were still wrestling with the notion of additional editing . About the story : Graves introduces the tale by imagining that the aged Claudius , having written his memoirs of the empire , meets with the oracle Sibyl , who assures him that his work will lie hidden for 1900 years or near , and then be revealed to an astonished world . The cast is difficult to follow at times , " I , Claudius " being an account of the Roman empire during 78 years , from the Age of Augustus in 24 B.C. through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D .. Anyone who endured the agonies of Latin I , II , III and IV will have a leg up in sorting out ancient Rome ' s literary , military and political characters who weave their way in and out of " I , Claudius . " This is a story of love and hate , of passion and perversity , of the endless cruelties and clashes between the emperors and the private citizens of Rome , all with their own ambitions , vices and idiosyncracies . Host of the syndicated version is not Alistair Cooke , but Anne Bancroft . " The incredible thing about I , Claudius , ' " she says , " is that everything you are about to see for the next 13 episodes really happened . It ' s all true , and you will be more and more astonished as each story unfolds . " I Claudius " is more than routine television , drawn as it is from two celebrated works of literature , " I , Claudius " and " Claudius , the God , " both by Graves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making the decisions for Ch. 38 about what to cut is the general manager , Daniel Berkery . " The presumption , " he said the other day , " is that we are not going to cut anything , but we are going to look at it carefully to make sure it doesn ' t violate community standards . " Berkery does not sound like a loose man with the scissors . " There are only three scenes in films that shocked me , " he said . " One was the opening rape scene in Death Wish . ' Another was the homosexual rape in Deliverance , ' and the third was the Russian roulette scene in The Deer Hunter . ' " We know there ' s an audience out there for this work . We think it ' s small , but we might be surprised . " " Running I , Claudius ' is part of an overall strategy for Ch. 38 to position ourselves in the Boston market , " he said . " This is a station that runs Gorilla at Large , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week with I , Claudius . ' " Lord knows it ' s not that we ' re schizophrenic , but we want to show that we ' re not just a station that runs sports and syndicated material . " " With I , Claudius ' though , we felt it was approprite for the Boston market because of the level of education and sophistiation here . This town has , if you will , the ring of the Athens of America . " If I were running a station in Memphis , Tenn. , I might think twice about running I , Claudius . ' " Boston ' s sophistiation notwithstanding , there are likely to be howls of protest , not about the violence , but rather the sex . The British are not as tight-cast as we Americans about nudity and four- letter words . That is why the British version and in some scenesthe public broadcasting version included orgies in full sight and full undress , sexual couplings filmed in ceiling mirrors , and an emperor ' s daughter competing with a famous prostitute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The orgy scenes are among the most graphic ever shown on American television . Well , we ' ve come a long way in 19 centuries . We ' ve outlawed murder , more or less , although the sex in ancient Rome is pretty much the same sex that can be found in Boston ' s Combat Zone or New York ' s Times Square or along the beach in Santa Monica . Indeed , sometimes we ' ve got the Romans beat thumbs down since we ' ve got sex on credit cards , a swing now , pay later phenomenon . When " I Claudius " comes to commercial television , though , what do we worry about ? Not the violent gladiator games , nor the garrottings nor the beheadings nor the other violent acts . No , cruelty is something we understand . Sex is another matter . Graphic murder on television is one thing , graphic sex or even frontal nudity , as it ' s called , is quite another . Let us turn our faces away from sex on television , then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in everyday conversation , and above all else , let us shield our eyes from the naked breast . Blindness , after all , is in the eye of the beholder.
