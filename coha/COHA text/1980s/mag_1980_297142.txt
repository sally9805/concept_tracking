The Presidency <P> Presidential transitions never run the way the people involved want them to run , or the way the nation expects . Politics and Government simply can not be programmed like an IBM training course for junior executives . Which is to say the Reagan transition , with its arguments , leaks , hesitations , minor embarrassments , excessive personnel and plethora of reports , is doing pretty well . <P> The Cabinet is forming , and so is the White House staff . The Administration-to-be has established a beachhead in Washington , gathered a talent pool , decreed that ceremony will be upgraded and the Inaugural Parade shortened . <P> In this environment of presence without power almost everything gets exaggerated-hopes , doubts , people , events . More telling portents are those subtle rituals of deliberation , delegation , explaining and announcing that Reagan and his people are now conducting . <P> Almost every normal transition has provided a preview of the tone and method of the new Administration . Kennedy formed his Government in the sagging elegance of his Georgetown home and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nixon installed himself on the 39th floor of New York City 's majestic Hotel Pierre , and , as he chose the members of his Administration , the world waited far below . <P> Ronald Reagan really is behaving like a chairman of the board . He is remarkably removed from the daily hubbub of the transition . He is plainly not aware of many of the details about the process and just as plainly uninterested in knowing about them . But it is he who decides-from instinct , from experience and from his trust in his advisers who make the recommendations . <P> While Reagan made two forays out of his Pacific redoubt to remind the world of his smile and desire to work with Congress and other powerful people , he has talked very little . The flow of commentary on appointees , world events and national issues that Presidents-elect in other times have been lured into has been avoided . His image is compressed and contained , drawn deliberately and somewhat vaguely as the power that is felt behind the stage , emerging only for the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear on a President who truly intends to change directions . <P> Preliminary recommendations from the Reagan transition task forces have sent a minor shock wave through the capital . For most of the past 40 years this city has been used to new Presidents ' promising dramatic departures but actually only reassembling existing ideas and programs under new slogans . Already Reagan has been urged by his advance scouts to reconsider the proposed new MX missile system and seek a cheaper and more imaginative modification of our current missile arsenal . It has been recommended that upon taking office tie declare a national economic emergency ; that he seek congressional authority for a series of radical steps to bolster the private sector . <P> Nobody is yet very sure if many-or any-such suggestions will actually be translated into Government action . But in addition to its conservative direction , there is the first faint hint that Ronald Reagan 's Administration is willing to take risks in the hope of getting results . This is an approach that has not been tried very much in Washington in recent years .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
