When he arrived in Moscow last week , a Soviet official asked to see some identification . " My face is my passport , " replied Vladimir Horowitz , 81 , returning to his homeland for the first time since he fled to the West 61 years ago . The pianist , who is to perform two concerts in Moscow and Leningrad under a new U.S.-Soviet cultural exchange , was reunited with his niece Elena , 70 , and visited relatives and old friends including Elena , daughter of Composer Alexander Scriabin , who had idolized Horowitz since her youth . While authorities have given the maestro a less than warm welcome , Horowitz clearly retains a special place in the hearts of the Soviet people .

" I think he will remember this until the end of his life , " said Composer Sergei Chedbotarev . " And we will too . "                  @ @ @
