Are black youths more likely to commit crimes than whites ? A glance at the nation 's prison population would suggest that the answer is yes . But a surprising new federally funded study says not necessarily . In 1976 University of Colorado Sociologist Delbert Elliott began to follow a nationwide cross section of 1,700 young people , ages 11 to 17 at the time . Periodically they reported to him , in confidence , any episodes of their own criminal or delinquent behavior , whether or not they were caught . The finding after ten years : those who were white reported nearly as many crimes as blacks but fewer were arrested . This held true , Elliott found , whether he was considering less serious crimes , such as underage drinking or petty vandalism , or whether he measured major lawbreaking , such as assault or drug selling . <P> The study suggests that economic class is an important factor in how youths are treated by the juvenile justice system , whether they are black or white . Elliott believes that when more affluent youths run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find lenient treatment from police , and that courts are more willing to release them into the custody of parents who can promise counseling and special schools . Says he : " When lower-class families do n't have these options , the court has little alternative but to order a jail term . "
