IT 'S MY TURN Directed by Claudia Weill Screenplay by Eleanor Bergstein <P> It 's My Turn confirms what Starting Over suggested : that Jill Clayburgh is Hollywood 's most adorable klutz . Her skinny limbs jut out at odd angles , like folding yardsticks . Her face seems the work of an impish sculptor who added an Emmett Kelly nose to those handsome features . Her hair has declared war on itself . She hunches over her food as if protecting it from invaders , and swallows champagne in one gulp , as if it had an egg in it . She moves like an awkward little girl who in her mid-30s is still Daddy 's favorite . She is very dear . <P> Kate Gunzinger ( Clayburgh ) , a Chicago math professor , is at a crossroads in her professional and personal life . Does she accept a more prestigious position in New York and leave her amiable goof of a lover ( Charles Grodin ) ? Does she commit herself to a charmingly direct ex-baseball player ( Michael Douglas ) ? Both men try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does she go left , right or back to Square 1 ? Curiously , the movie sees Kate not so much at a turning point as jogging on a treadmill where you meet the nicest people . For this reason , the film could serve as the basis for a superior sitcom . <P> If It 's My Turn were a triple-A ball player , the scouting report might read : " Excellent singles hitter , moderate speed , covers a lot of ground , good prospect for the majors . " Screenwriter Bergstein has a flair for funny lines that arise from the characters , and Director Weill has drawn fine performances from a large , likable cast . Some movies show , others reveal . It 's My Turn is a minor revelation . <P> - R.C.
