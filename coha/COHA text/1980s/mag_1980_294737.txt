Formaldehyde leads the list <P> Employees of the local social services department looked forward to their relocation to a new building in downtown San Francisco last year . But almost as soon as the move occurred , one of them was plagued by headaches , skin rashes , a dry throat and coughing . Puzzled doctors prescribed so much medication that she was hospitalized twice for drug reactions . Depressed by her strange illness , she had to stop working temporarily . <P> The woman was the victim of a new type of environmental blight : indoor pollution . By caulking seams , using multi-pane windows and packing walls with insulation , building owners can halve fuel needs for heating and cooling . But the saving comes at a price : seepage of fresh air from outside is so sharply reduced that pollutants from the building itself can accumulate to dangerous levels . <P> Calling such indoor smog an emerging health problem , the Comptroller General has cited half a dozen harmful substances detected in unusual quantities in super-sealed buildings . Among them : carbon monoxide and nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaky furnaces ; the radioactive gas radon , which results from the natural decay of radium , an element found in soil , rocks and other building materials ; and numerous particles of dust , soot and asbestos . <P> But the substance stirring the most concern-and the apparent source of the California woman 's illness-is formaldehyde , a gas given off by , among other things , poorly installed foam insulation . Although colorless , the gas has a pungent odor , can irritate the eyes and nose and can cause dizziness and vomiting . If animal tests are any indication , it can also create more serious problems . Subjected to prolonged high concentrations of formaldehyde , at levels comparable to those in some buildings , rats and mice developed cancerous tumors in their noses . <P> Industry spokesmen note that formaldehyde has long been used safely in products from nonwrinkle fabrics to fiberboard and drugs . The lab results , they say , can not be extrapolated to humans . But many officials disagree . Massachusetts banned the sale of formaldehyde-based foam insulation last year , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Government , which now employs tax incentives to spur use of energy-saving insulation , including formaldehyde foam . Acting on the conclusion of a scientific advisory panel that there is indeed a cancer risk involved , the Consumer Product Safety Commission is slated to vote this week on whether to restrict foam insulation .
