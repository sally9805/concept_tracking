FAIRFIELD , Conn.  --  General Electric Co. reported third-quarter earnings rose 23% from last year ' s restated earnings on the strength of its plastics , financial services and medical systems businesses . John F. Welch Jr. , chairman of the industrial and consumer products , broadcasting and financial services concern , said third-quarter results " position us well to achieve our objective of a second consecutive year of strong double-digit earnings growth . " Analysts said one sour note was lower profit from major appliances because of problems with refrigerator compressors . Third-quarter earnings rose to $815 million , or 90 cents a share , from the restated $661 million , or 73 cents a share . Revenue fell 1% to $9. 31 billion from $9. 4 billion . However , GE said revenue rose 7% for the quarter after accounting for businesses it bought and sold beginning in 1987 . Earnings were restated to reflect adoption of new income tax accounting rules . Without the restatement , earnings rose 16% , which GE called a " more meaningful " comparison . " Earnings were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. McCoy , an analyst at UBS Securities Inc . " Sales increased better than expected . " However , he noted that troubles at GE ' s major appliance business hurt third-quarter operating margins for the entire company , although margins , at 9. 6% , were still above the 9. 4% of last year ' s third quarter . GE shares rose 12. 5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , to close at $44. 125 . Profit at major appliances , GE said , " was considerably below " a year ago because of higher material costs , competitive pricing and a one-time provision for warranty costs on GE refrigerators that use the company ' s new rotary compressors . The compressor trouble is a major embarrassment for the company because the manufacture of rotary compressors and GE ' s decision to use rotary instead of reciprocating compressors in large refrigerators two years ago were promoted as a major technological innovation . However , refrigerators bigger than 21 cubic feet too often don ' t cool properly , forcing GE to fix them under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said GE won ' t abandon rotary compressors , but for the time being will put them only in its smaller refrigerators . " We ' ll continue to work on rotary technology , " the spokesman said . GE originally switched to rotary compressors because they are generally cheaper to make . Operating profit at National Broadcasting Co. fell because of the cost of covering the political conventions . But a spokesman said GE still expects the unit to post a " nice increase " for the year . In addition to big operating earnings increases at GE ' s medical systems , plastics and financial services businesses , GE said cost cutting at the lighting , motors and electrical distribution and control businesses boosted third-quarter earnings at those units . Aircraft engine operating profit was " slightly ahead " of last year ' s strong third quarter , the company said . For the nine months , earnings fell 5. 6% to $2. 38 billion , or $2. 63 a share , from a restated $2. 52 billion , or $2. 76 a share .
