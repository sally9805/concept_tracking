DANIEL Directed by Sidney Lumet ; Screenplay by E.L . Doctorow <P> We know that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow , the Depression-era bank robbers and murderers , were really a couple of lovable kids who just got their stars crossed . The movies told us so . Now audiences are to be instructed in the exemplary lives of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg . Sure they were convicted and executed for conspiring to pass atomic secrets to the Soviet Union . But we know that the 1950s were a time of anti-Red hysteria ; the sitting judge on the Rosenberg case might have been Joe McCarthy . How do we know ? Daniel tells us so . Alas for Sidney Lumet , history hangs like a crape cloud over his new film . The Rosenberg File , just published to a chorus of raves , scrupulously documents Julius Rosenberg 's involvement with a Soviet spy ring ; Ethel was probably a knowledgeable but passive member of the cabal . Since the authors ' preliminary findings were published in 1979 , Daniel 's angry grimace looks like a rictus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grant Lumet and Screenwriter E.L . Doctorow ( whose novel , The Book of Daniel , the film follows closely ) creative license and a clean slate . Daniel is , after all , the story not only of Paul and Rochelle Isaacson , but also of their children Daniel and Susan and their attempts to understand and revive what the film 's press notes describe as the Isaacsons ' " dream of social justice . " <P> The film flashes fro and to in both time and style , alternating the fluorescent glare of the late 1960s , as Daniel ( Timothy Hutton ) searches for the truth about his parents , with the hazy twilight glow of his parents ' day , when spellbinding romantics saw a golden future for American Communism . <P> The oldtime Communists were a strange breed : passionate and crafty in agitating for civil and union rights but blinkered idealists against the evidence of repression , even genocide , within the Soviet Union . These radical " good Germans " had their excuses , as do all true believers .

Paul Isaacson ( Mandy Patinkin ) was the party 's star tummler , strutting as vivaciously on Death Row as he would have on the Borscht Belt . And Rochelle ( Lindsay Grouse ) was a righteous , steel-rimmed Yiddish mama . <P> As fact or as fancy fiction , Daniel rarely achieves its ambitions . Hutton , Grouse , Amanda Plummer ( as Susan ) , Ellen Barkin ( as Daniel 's wife ) and Tovah Feldshuh ( as a childhood friend ) are among the most talented and persuasive of young stars ; here they are either given little to do or are buried in charmless roles . One brief sequence suggests the film 's potential power .
