Not long ago I was invited to read some tale of mine before an assembly of physicians who had , as it happened , a visionary captain . This man knew his Emerson : Emerson in " The American Scholar " had famously noted what he called the " amputation " of society , each trade and profession " ridden by the routine of ... craft . " " The priest becomes a form , " Emerson wrote , " the attorney a statute-book ; the mechanic a machine ; the sailor a rope of the ship . " And the doctor a CAT scan . The doctors ' visionary captain was out to ignite an Emersonian idea . He would set down among the doctors a fable-maker : a writer . What he had in mind was interpenetration , cutting through the dividing membrane of craft , peopling one cell with two temperaments . The pu pose of the experiment would be to increase the doctors ' capacity to imagine . The doctors , he explained , too often do not presume a connection of vulnerability between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctors ' own flesh ; too often the doctors do not conceive of themselves as equally mortal , equally open to fortune 's disasters . The writer , an imaginer by trade , will suggest a course of connecting , of entering into the tremulous spirit of the helpless , the fearful , the apart . The writer will demonstrate the contagion of passion and compassion that is known in medicine as empathy and in art as insight . This , then , is the plan . The writer , though igCynthia Chick is the author of Art &; Ardor , Levitation : Five Fictions , and The Cannibal Galaxy . She is at work on a new novel . norant of every scientific punctilio , will command the leap into the Other . That is how tales are made . And so , not suspecting what would come of it , I began to read out a narrative about a sexually active , intellectually sophisticated , faraway planet where the birth of children is no longer welcome , and finally , for prurient technological reasons , no longer possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , illicitly and improbably ; and everything ends in barbarism and savagery . In short , a parable . Also a satire , outfitted in drollery and ribaldry . Drenched , above all , in metaphor . The tale of a lascivious planet too earnestly self-important to tolerate children could only have been directed against artifice and malice , sophistry and self-indulgence ; it could only have pressed for fruitfulness and health , sanity and generosity , bloom and continuity . My story and its barren conclusion were , I thought , a contrivance that declared itself on the side of life ; and therefore , presumably , on the side of the doctors themselves . In bringing metaphor to the doctors , surely I was obeying their captain , and opening the inmost valve of the imagining heart ? A rumbling . A stirring , a murmuring , a collective hiss . Here were the doctors , all at once ranked before me , a white-coated captious tribe , excited , resentful , bewildered , belligerent . They accused me of obscurantism . They wanted plain speech . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fable , image , echo , irony , satire , obliqueness , double meaning , the call to interpret , the call to penetrate , the call 62 HARPER 'S MAGAZINE i MAY to comment and diagnose . Before the use of metaphor they felt themselves stripped and defenseless ; it was clear I had sickened them . Now the argument may be urged that physicians are themselves abundantly given over to metaphorical speech and thought ; that they live every hour under the raucous wing of the Angel of Death and Crippling , whose devastating imagery they can not deny , and whose symbols they read cell by cell , X-ray by X-ray ; that ambiguity and interpretation are ineluctably in the grain of their tasks ; that all medical literature , however hidden in obscure vocabularies in abstruse journals , is , case after case , a literature of redemption through parable : new cases remember past cases . But dismiss all this . Say that the doctors have rejected metaphor as not of their realm ? as inimical to their gravity . They do it because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be , they are serious men and women . The struggle to heal , the will to repair the shattered , the will to redeem and make whole ? this is what we mean when we speak of lives lived under the conscientious pressure of our moral nature . And metaphor , what is metaphor ? Frivolity . Triviality . Lightness of mind . Baubles . To talk in metaphor to serious men and women , to talk of metaphor to serious men and women , is to disengage oneself from the great necessary bond of community . It is to cut oneself off from the heat of human pity ? and all for the sake of a figure of speech . If the doctors think this way ? if numbers of other serious men and women think this way ? it may be , first , because they associate metaphor with writers and artists of every sort , and , secondly , because they associate writers and artists with what we always call inspiration . It is n't only that doctors like to keep away from inspiration on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for serious people , mainly a matter of valuing stability over spontaneity , or responsibility over elation . Something there is in inspiration that hints of wildness ? a wildness even beyond the quick streak of possession , that brings resolution without warning . Serious people are used to feeling an at-homeness in their minds . Inspiration is an intruder , a kidnapper of reason , a burglar who shoots the watchdogs dead . Inspiration chases off sentries and censors and monitors . Inspiration instigates reckless cliff-walking ; it sweeps its quarry to the edge of unfamiliar abysses . Inspiration is the secret sharer who flies out of pandemonium . All these characteristics do suggest that inspiration is allied to the stuff of metaphor . Is n't metaphor the poetry-making faculty itself ? And where does the poetry-making faculty derive from , if not from inspiration ? It is in fact a truInspiration is one of those ideas which can , without objection , claim a clear history ; but never the history of poetry . Its genesis is in natural religion , or , rather , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an essay rather unsuitably called " History " ? it might more accurately have been named " Anti-History , " since it annihilates the distinction between Then and Now ? Emerson recounts a picturesque conversation with " a lady with whom I was riding in a forest who said to Inc that the woods always seemed to her to wait , as if the genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the wayfarer had passed onward ; a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the fairies , which breaks off on the approach of human feet . " Now that is a very pretty story , but only because in Emerson 's day the woods around Concord were safe , and the civilization of genii and fairies long finished . Inspiration may end in daydream or fancy , but it sets our in terror . For us Pan is all poetry , a charming faun with a flute ; among the Greeks he caused panic . Fairies and all the other spirits of natural religion were once malevolent powers profoundly feared . Devout Athenians on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frightening away the spirits as a somber religious duty . Emerson , reading history as benign nature , reads natural religion as a sublime illumination ? " The idiot , the Indian , the child and the unschooled farmer 's boy , " he announces , " stand nearer to the light by which nature is to be read , than the dissector or the antiquary " ? whereas for its historical adherents , its flesh-and-blood congregants , the religion of nature was mainly panic , dread , and desperate appeasement of the uncanny . Poetry , including Emersonian poetizing , seeps in only after two millennia have exhausted and silenced the fairies ; only after the great god Pan is indisputably , unexaggeratedly , dead . In natural religion there are no metaphors ; the genii are there ; the poetry is not yet born . The genii are there , potent and ubiquitous . They are in the birds and in the beasts , in the brooks , in the muttering oaks ? the majestic Zeus himself got his start as a god who spoke out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still follow its process , and there is nothing metaphoric in any of it . Apollo was a latecomer to Delphi . Earthquake-prone , the place had once belonged to Gaea , the earth goddess , and the shrine was built over a gorge , or pit , a sort of saucer in the ground , within sight of the mountains of Pamassus . Excavations have uncovered no crack or opening of any kind in the floor of the saucer , but a certain gas was said to issue from a hole in the earth : the narcotic stench of decomposition ? below lay the carcass of the terrible python Apollo slew . An underground stream flowed there , prophetic waters called Kassotis ; these too had narcotic properties . The agent of divination ? the enthusiast , the sibyl possessed by the god ? was at first , apparently , a young virgin . Then the rules were changed , no one seems to know why , and now the votary had to be a respectable , often married , woman of at least fifty ? she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was the Pythoness , or Pythia , Apollo 's oracle , the incarnation of everything we mean , in our own civilization and language , by inspiration . Her method was to induce frenzy . She chewed the leaves of a narcotic plant , drank from the narcotic spring , breathed in the narcotic vapor . A number of attending priests , called the Holy Ones , members of important local families , waited until she seemed on the brink of seizure and then led her to a tripod , the seat of the god 's speaking . These notables already had in hand the question the god was to treat , The answer came , in the moment of possession , from the mouth of the sibyl either as howls or murmurs ? cascades of gibberish flooded the shrine . When the Pythia 's vatic fit was over , the priests had to take up the task of interpretation , a role both intellectual and political . It is conceivable that their interpretations were composed in advance , since the questioner 's predicament had been submitted in advance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the priests now and then accepted a bribe in exchange for a politically favorable interpretation . Still , they were without doubt men of no small gifts : they were in fact devoted to their ingenious versifying , and would sometimes set their interpretations in the meter of Homer or Hesiod , or else in succinctly ambiguous prose that , no matter what the future brought , was always on the mark . The replies of the oracle were famously broad , ranging from family court matters to statecraft . The priests , like most priests everywhere , tended to think conservatively , though they were not unenlightened , and were capable of liberal decisions : the occasional manumission of slaves , for instance . Delphi , the fount of inspiration , was in essence would be an untruth ? that because the oracle 's infusion of the god-spirit at Delphi had nothing to do with our idea of religion as conscience , Greece was a society that paid no attention to the moral life . We know otherwise , from Socrates , Plato , and Aristotle preeminently ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , Greek speculation . What else is the story of Antigone if not a story of conscience ? What else is tragedy if not moral seriousness ? And beyond these , the mind of science , the mind of art , are Greek . There is not one Greece , but a hundred : heroes side by side with slaves , reason side by side with magic , the self-restraint of Epictetus side by side with sensuousness . It is the Greeks , W. H. Auden reminds us , " who have taught us , not to think ? that all human beings have always done ? but to think about our thinking . " If one nation can be measured as more intelligent than all other nations that ever were , or were to be , that is how we can measure the Greeks . And the priestly interpretations at Delphi were themselves grounded in an immensity of human understanding : ambiguity is psychology ; ambiguity is how we sort things out , how we decide . " Nothing in excess " is a Delphic inscription . Yet what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps this statement shocks you with its instant absurdity . You will want to say , What ? A nation of myth , and you claim it has no metaphor ? Are n't myths the greatest metaphors of all ? And surely the most blatant ? Or you will want to listen again to the priestly interpretations at Delphi : are n't these , in their fertility of implication , exactly what we mean by metaphoric language ? The answer in both instances , I think , is no . Remember that mythology took on the inwardness of poetry only when the gods were no longer efficacious , only after they had ascended out of the reality of their belief system into the misted charms of enchantment . And even now , when we read that Apollo slew the python , what do we learn ? We learn that snakes are dangerous and that the gods are brave and strong . For Apollo 's constituents , the aversion to snakes ? and also their strange sacredness ? was confirmed ; so was the reverence for Apollo . If there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods ought to be emulated ; or else that it is hubris to suppose thebravery of the gods can be emulated . But why , you will say , why speak of " learning , " of " lessons " ? Do we go to the gods for schooling , or for self-revelation ? Look , you will say , how humanly resplendent : each god represents an aspect of human passion . Here is beauty , here is lust , here is wisdom , here is chance , here is courage , here is mendacity , here is war , and so on and so on . Is n't that metaphoric enough for you ? Observe : there is no god or goddess who stands for the still , small voice of conscience . As for the Delphic riddles : they were recipes , not standards . They were directions , not principles . Nor was there any consistent social compassion inherent in their readings . The oracle remembered nothing . The voice of conscience did not speak through the god at Delphi , or through any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Greece , especially among the geniuses ; it could be found almost anywhere , except in religion , among the people . The reason is plain . Inspiration has no memory . Inspiration is spontaneity ; its opposite is memory , which is history as judgment . When conscience flashed out of Greece , as it did again and again , it did so idiosyncratically , individually , without a base in a community model or a collective history . There was no heritage of a common historical experience to universalize ethical feeling . To put it otherwise : there was no will to create a universal moral parable ; there was no will to enter and harness metaphor for the sake of a universal conscience . By turning their religious life into poetry , we have long since universalized the Greeks . They are our psychology . We have ravished their cosmos and their beliefs to explain ourselves to ourselves . But that is our doing , not theirs . The Greeks , with all their astonishments , and in spite of the serenity of " Nothing in excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept slaves . Greeks enslaved foreigners and other Greeks . Anyone captured in war was dragged back as a slave , even if he was a Greek of a neighboring polis . In Athens slaves , especially women , were often domestic servants , but of 150,000 adult male slaves , 20,000 were set to work in the silver mines , in ten-hour shifts , in tunnels three feet high , shackled and lashed ; the forehead of a retrieved runaway was branded with a hot iron . Aristotle called slaves " animate tools , " forever indispensable , he thought , unless you were a utopian who believed in some future invention of automatic machinery . In Athens it was understood that the most efficient administrator of many slaves was someone who had himself been born into slavery and then freed ; such a man would know , out of his own oppressive experience with severity , how to bear down hard . A foreigner who was not enslaved lived under prejudice and restriction . Demosthenes tells about the humiliCRITICISM 65 ation of a certain Euxitheus , a prosperous Athenian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be overheard speaking with an un-Athenian accent . Euxitheus had to prove that his father had in fact been Athenian-born , or his own status would drop to that of resident alien , stripping him of his property and his rights , and endangering his freedom . That the Greeks called all foreigners " barbarians " is notorious enough ; but it was not so much a category as a jeer . It imputed to all foreign languages the animal sound of a grunt or a bark : bar-bar , bar-bar . So there is much irony in our having universalized Greece through poetizing it . The Greeks were not only not universalists ; they scorned the idea . They were firm in despising the stranger . They had no pity for the stranger . ' As a society they never undertook to imagine what it was to bethe Other ; the outsider ; the alien ; the slave ; the oppressed ; the sufferer ; the outcast ; the opponent ; the barbarian who owns feelings and deserves rights . And that is because they did not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any y historical metaphor to contain memory . e come now to a jump . A short jump across the Mediterranean ; a long jump to the experience of another people , less lucky than the Greeks and ? perhaps because Less lucky ? collectively obsessed with the imagination of pity ; or call it the imagination of reciprocity . The Jews ? they were named Hebrews then ? were driven to a preoccupation with history and with memory almost at the start of their hard-pressed desert voyage into civilization . The distinguished Greeks had their complex polity , their stunning cities ; in these great cities they nurtured unrivaled sophistications . The Jews began as primitives and nomads , naive shepherds as remote from scientific thinking as any other primitives ; in their own culture , when at length they established their simple towns , they had no art or theater or athletics , and never would have . A good ( - as , - can be made ? though not a waterright one ? that the Jews did not become students and scholars until they learned how from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , finally , the Jews carried the memory of 400 years of torment . Unlike the citizen-Greeks , their history did not introduce civics ; it introduced bricks without straw , and the Jews who escaped from Rameses ' Egypt were a rough slave rabble , a mixed multitude ; a rowdy , discontented , rebellious , ragtag mob . A nation of slaves is different from a nation of philosophers . Out of that slavery a new thing was made . It should not be called a philosophy , because philosophy was Greek , and this was an envisioning the Greeks had always avoided , or else had never wished to invent , or else had been unable to invent . I have all along been calling this new thing metaphor . It came about because thirty generations of slavery in Egypt were never forgotten ? though not as a form of grudge-holding . A distinction should be drawn between grudge-holding and memory ; they are never the same . As for grudge-holding , it was forbidden to the ex-slave rabble . The helping hand , says Exodus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy 's donkey or ox going astray , you must bring it back to him . If you happen on your enemy 's donkey collapsed under its burden , you may not pass by ; you must help your enemy relieve the animal . The Egyptians were cruel enemies and crueler oppressors ; the ex-slaves will not forget ? not out of spite for the wrongdoers , but as a means to understand what it is to be an outcast , a foreigner , an alien of any kind . By turning the concrete memory of slavery into a universalizing metaphor of reciprocity , the ex-slaves discover a way to convert imagination into a serious moral instrument . Now a fair representation of the Delphic Oracle is not the work of a minute ; this we have seen , and it is a paradox . Inspiration , which is as sudden and as transient as an electrical trajectory , takes a long time to delineate , possibly because latency ( a hidden prior knowing ) and unintelligibility are in its nature . It is in the nature of metaphor to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered as metaphoric memory , can be spoken in a moment ; in a single sentence . What this sentence is , we know ; we have built every idea of moral civilization on it . It is a sentence that conceivably sums up at the start every revelation that came afterward . It has given birth and tongue to saints and prophets , early and late . Its first dreamers are not its exclusive owners and operators ; it belongs to everyone . That is the point of its having been dreamed into existence at all . The sentence is easily identified . It follows sixteen verses behind " Love thy neighbor as thyself , " but , majestic as that is , it is not the most majestic , because its subject is not the most recalcitrant . Our neighbor is usually of our own tribe , and looks like us and talks like us . Our neighbor is usually familiar ; our neighbor is usually not foreign , or of another race . " Love thy neighbor as thyself " is a glorious , civilizing , unifying sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , difficult in performance . And it reveals at once the little seed of parable : the phrase " as thyself . " " Thyself " ? that universe of feeling ? is the model . " As thyself " becomes the commanding meraphor . But we are still , with our neighbor , in Our Town . We are still , with the self , in psychology . We have not yet penetrated to history and memory . The more compelling sentence carries us there ? Leviticus 19 , verse 34 ? and you will hear in it history as metaphor , memory raised to parable : The stranger that sojoumeth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you , and you shall love him as yourself ; because you were strangers in the land of Egypt . Two chapters on , Leviticus 24 , verse 22 , insists further : You shall have one manner of law , the same for the stranger as for the home-born . " A similar injunction appears in Exodus , and again in Deuteronomy , and again in Numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treating the stranger as an equal both in emotion and under law , appears thirty-six times in the Pentateuch . It is there because a moral connection has been made with the memory of bondage . Leviticus 24 , verse 22 , demands memory , and then converts memory into metaphor : " Because you were strangers in the land of Egypt . " Bondage becomes a metaphor of pity for the outsider ; Egypt becomes the great metaphor of reciprocity . " And a stranger shall you not oppress , " says Exodus 23 , verse 8 , " for you know the heart of a stranger , seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt . " There stands the parable ; there stands the sacred metaphor of belonging , one heart to another . Without the metaphor of memory and history , we can not imagine the life of the Other . We can not imagine what it is to be someone else . Metaphor is the reciprocal agent , the universalizing force : it makes possible the power to envision the stranger 's heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences ? Nowhere beyond the reach of the Pentateuch did the alien and the home-born live under the same code . The Romans originally had a single word , hostis , to signify both enemy and stranger ; in early Roman law , every alien was classed as an enemy , devoid of rights . In Germanic law the alien was rechtsunfahig , a pariah with no access to justice . The Greeks made slaves of the stranger and then taunted him with barks , There have been , and still are , religio-political systems that have incorporated the teaching of contempt , turning the closest neighbors into the most despised strangers ? a loathing expressed in words like " untouchable , " " dhimmi , " " deicide . " In our own country , slavery thrived under the wing of a freedom-proclaiming Constitution until the middle of the last century . And in 1945 , a British camera on a single day in a single German deathcamp just liberated photographed a bulldozer sweeping into five pits 5,000 starved and abused human corpses at a time , a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfit for the right to live . By now you will have noticed that I have CRITICISM 67 sea , for example . If you know wine , says the image , you will know the sea ; the sea is for sailors , but wine is what we learn at home . Inspiration calls for possession and increases strangeness . Metaphor uses what we already possess and reduces strangeness . Inspiration belongs to riddle and oracle . Metaphor belongs to clarification and humane conduct . This is the meaning of the contrast between the Oracle at Delphi and the parable of servitude in Egypt . Inspiration attaches to the mysterious temples of anti-language . Metaphor overwhelmingly attaches to the house of language . Should it , then , seem perplexing that both the oracle and the parable are identically dedicated to interpretation ? The chief business of the priests at Delphi is practical interpretation . The incessant allusion to Egyptian bondage is again for the purpose of usable interpretation . And still the differences are total . Because the Delphic priests must begin each time with a fresh-hatched inspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any universal principle or precept . Principles and precepts derive from an accumulation of old events . Delphi never has old events ; every event in that place is singular ; the cry from the tripod is blazingly individual , particular , peculiar unto itself . From the tripod rises the curse of nepenthe ; amnesia ; forgetting ; nor is it the voice of the race of humanity and its continuities we hear . The tragedy of the Delphic priests is not that their interpretations are obliged to start from gibberish . After all , what goes in as raw gibberish comes out as subject to rational decision , and it is more than conceivable that social principles might be extracted from a body of such decisions . But the priests think consciously only of their own moment . Their system is not organized toward the universalizing formulation . The tragedy of the priests is that , cut off from the uses of history , experience , and memory , they are helpless to make the future . They may , in a manner of speaking , " prophesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not construct a heritage . They have nothing to pass on . They can not give birth to metaphor ; one thing does not suggest another thing . In a place where each heart is meant to rave on in its uniqueness , there is no means for the grief of one heart to implicate the understanding of another heart . In the end , inspiration and its devices turn away from the hope of regeneration . Nowadays much of American literature is included in this Delphic fix . Certain novelists claim that fiction must express a pure autonomy ? must become a self-sufficient language-machine in order to be innovative ; others strip language bare of any nuance . These aestheticians and minimalists , seeming opposites , both Delphi , is also a priest of interpretation ; but what it interprets is memory . Metaphor is compelled to press hard on language and storytelling ; it inhabits language at its most concrete . As the shocking extension of the unknown into our most intimate , most feeling , most private selves , metaphor is the enemy of abstraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be , declares the parable of Egypt , if you did not take the memory of slavery as your exemplar ! Think how ironic your life would be if you passed through it without the power of connection ! Novels , those vessels of irony and connection , are nothing if not metaphors . The great novels transform experience into idea because it is the way of metaphor to transform memory into a principle of continuity . By " continuity " I mean nothing less than literary seriousness , which is unquestionably a branch of life-seriousness . Now , if all this has persisted in sounding more like a lecture in morals than the meditation on language it professes to be , it may be worth turning to that astonishing comment in T. S. Eliot 's indispensable essay on what he terms " concentration " of experience . " Someone said , " says Eliot in " Tradition and the Individual Talent , " " The dead writers are remote from us because we know so much more than they did . ' Precisely , and they are that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of memory . The dead writers have turned metaphoric ; they contain our experience , and they alter both our being and our becoming . Here we have an exact counterpart of biblical memory : because you were strangers in Egypt . Through metaphor , the past has the capacity to imagine us , and we it . Through metaphorical concentration , doctors can imagine what it is to be their patients . Those who have no pain can imagine those who suffer . Those at the center can imagine what it is to be outside . The strong can imagine what it is to be weak . Illuminated lives can imagine the dark . Poets in their twilight can imagine the borders of stellar fire . We strangers can imagine the familiar hearts of strangers .
