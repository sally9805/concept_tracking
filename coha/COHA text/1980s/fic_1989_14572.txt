( Sounds of subway trains as an overture in the darkness , a roar and rattle and hiss , as of a giant dragon . When lights come up , we see JOSE in front of a kiosk . Fourteen , thin , intense , she crackles with energy and a sometimes manic humor . There is a fragility about her that makes people want to protect her . She is dressed in a wild , patchwork style  --  layers of clothing  --  and wears sunglasses and several men 's wristwatches . She is drunk . SGT . FRANK , a burly , plainclothes police detective in his 40 's , appears from behind the news kiosk . ) JOSE ( Tries to light a cigarette , but her matches keep going out . To SGT . FRANK . ) Hey !

If you and me get together , you can call me Ho-say . Whaddya think ? CARLOS FAVA We not gettin ' together . JOSE We do n't have to have a baby right away . I mean , I do n't mind if you want to get to know me first . Although my mama said I 'm real complicated . Or maybe that was my dead daddy said that just before I killed him . ( Pause . A wistful note creeps into her voice . ) I just think I might feel more . Oh , y'know , solid with a baby of my own to hold . ( Lights out on JOSE and CARLOS . In the darkness steam swirls over the stage , and we hear a hissing sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see two bag ladies , sleeping on benches under mounds of rags. ) p. 12 JOSE ( Entering , she approaches the benches . ) Hey ! Anybody home ? DALLAS ( DALLAS sits up on her bench and swivela her head like a periscope . She is blind , also ancient , tattered , yet oddly aristocratic in these surroundings . She has a shrill , imperious voice . ) Who 's there ? JOSE ( No realizing DALLAS is blind . ) Hi . I 'm Josephine . You can call me Jose . DALLAS ( Clutching her blankets . ) Go away ! Lowanda , tell it to go away ! LOWANDA ( LOWANDA stirs and slowly sits up . An ancient , wild black woman , like a witch from a fairy-tale book , hair sticking out in clumps . ) What you doin ' here ? JOSE Just looking around . LOWANDA Go look someplace else .

For once in my life I 've got a good man , and Jose is n't going to scare him off . ( Lights out on Mrs. THOMPSON and SGT . FRANK , up on LOWANDA and DALLAS . JOSE appears with sandwiches and coffee in styrofoam cups . She goes to one bench , sets the coffees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mound of rags . ) JOSE Hey ! I got some food ! LOWANDA Who 's that ? JOSE Jose . Remember me ? Look : hot coffee and sandwiches . LOWANDA Sandwiches ? Where 'd you get sandwiches ? JOSE From the food wagon . LOWANDA What kinda sandwiches ? JOSE Peanut butter and jelly . DALLAS Who 's that ? JOSE Me . Josephine . DALLAS I do n't know a Josephine ! Did she call long distance ? p. 20 LOWANDA That girl Jose . She brung sandwiches . JOSE And coffee . DALLAS I smell it ! Just like the Biltmore . JOSE ( Removing lid from one coffee , she holds it to DALLAS ' lips . ) Yeah . It 's nice . C'm on . Try a little . LOWANDA Gim me a sandwich . And coffee . ( JOSE does . LOWANDA tears off the plastic wrap and eats ravenously . ) JOSE ( To DALLAS . ) Would you like your sandwich ? DALLAS I certainly do .

LOWANDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You need a place , there 's some old cans way downstairs nobody uses anymore . DALLAS Bathrooms , not cans ! And they 're locked up . You know that . LOWANDA She smart , she can bust the lock . JOSE Why n't you live there ? LOWANDA Too far down for us to walk back up . Done it once , that 's enough . JOSE ( Turns to go . ) Well , thanks . p. 22 LOWANDA Name 's Lowanda , if you need me . ( JOSE stops and smiles radiantly . ) ( Lights out on LOWANDA , DALLAS , up on CARLOS . JOSE enters with a small box . ) JOSE This time you 're gon na love it . CARLOS FAVA Holy Mother ! You back . JOSE Go on . Open it . CARLOS FAVA I got enough neckties . JOSE This is something I know you want . C'm on ! CARLOS FAVA ( He ca n't resist opening box . ) Hey ! What 's this ? JOSE The best fucking knife you ever saw . CARLOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open it up . It 's got everything : can opener , scissors CARLOS FAVA ( Opens knife , ca n't help admiring all the gadgets . ) Not bad . JOSE And y'know what ? I got my own place now . CARLOS FAVA Yeah ? JOSE Fixed up an old can on the downtown side . Way under the trains . Real nice . You can come and visit when you want a little quiet . p. 23 CARLOS FAVA Maybe . JOSE See ya . ( She starts to walk away . ) CARLOS FAVA You might . ( Lights out on CARLOS . In the darkness we hear the Dylan song , " Tambourine Man . " As lights come up on JOSE , she is sitting on the mattress in her bathroom apartment with a portable stereo cassette player on her knees . Her stuffed animals are arranged in front of her like an audience . She has a bottle of whiskey and is quite drunk . ) JOSE ( She takes a drink . ) Hey , Daddy . There 's your song . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stereos , Walkmans , radios ? Man , our house was full of that shit . You were a real good thief , like me . ( Pause . ) ' Member how you 'd sing loud , and try to get Mama to sing too ? But she 'd say , " I do n't I ove you anymore , John , because you 're a drunk and a dope-head . " And then you 'd say , " Do n't worry , Lani , I do n't love you more'n you do n't love me . " ( Pause . ) It 's real tiring to have mothers and fathers talk like that all the time in your house . Because sometimes a kid needs a little room to feel things out . Like when you hear a person talk on TV and he says , this is really true . Or your teacher says you got to do it this way . Or your priest says you got to believe God is love . So how does a kid find out , without a little quiet of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside ? ( Pause . ) Sometimes talking to grownups is real depressing . p. 24 CARLOS FAVA ( Enters and stares at decorations . ) Not bad . How 'd you find this place ? JOSE Hey , it 's you ! ( She jumps up . ) I got a real estate agent to sell it to me cheap : only half a million because it 's so far under the earth . The closer you get to sunlight , the higher the price . And , man , by the time you get to ground level , next to Walgreen 's , you 're well over two million . CARLOS FAVA ( Walking around inspecting things . ) Still smells like a can . JOSE Yeah , well , I do take shits in here . But I been spraying it with perfume . CARLOS FAVA ( Touching the stuffed animals . ) Nice bears . JOSE Be careful with the animals . CARLOS FAVA ( Turns to her with a smile . ) They bite ? JOSE Some people . Not you . No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CARLOS FAVA You see me carryin ' a bear around ? JOSE Any one you want . You pick . How ' bout this blue one ? CARLOS FAVA Men do n't play with toys . p. 25 JOSE Okay , so do n't . But these are animals . Better'n most people , y ' know ? CARLOS FAVA Yeah . JOSE Like when I used to go to the zoo . I 'd wan na crawl right in the cages with the animals . Even the polar bears everybody said were dangerous . I 'd think , maybe for most people they 're dangerous , but the bears would know I 'm different . CARLOS FAVA You sleep down here ? JOSE Yeah . I broke the lock . It was real easy . Nobody 'd been down here in centuries . CARLOS FAVA They do n't use these old cans ' cause of the bums . JOSE Cleaning up , though : man , you should 've seen me ! At home , Mama could n't get me to do the damn dishes . Down here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor on my fucking hands and knees . Got rid of all the rat shit . Playing my music ; man , I was even singing while I fixed up this place . CARLOS FAVA Maybe you get a job cleanin ' for people . JOSE I do n't clean for nobody else ! This my own place . CARLOS FAVA You ai n't afraid somebody gon na find you down here ? JOSE I got other stuff to worry about . Big stuff , like inflation and nuclear war . p. 26 CARLOS FAVA One night , while you asleep , somebody gon na off you . Or worse . JOSE Man , you should 've seen me trying to get the mattress down here ! Found it in the street , and here I am , dragging it along the sidewalk , my fingers freezing off Anyway , this big guy sees me , and he says he 'll help me . CARLOS FAVA Not for nothin ' ? JOSE Whaddya think ? So this guy rolls up the mattress , and I make a scene , blast my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't notice this guy , bumping down the stairs with my mattress . But it was late , like two or three in the a.m. , so there were n't too many people but the regulars . CARLOS FAVA You playin ' games ai n't got no rules you ever heard of . JOSE How long you been living on the streets ? CARLOS FAVA I know my way around . JOSE Why n't you go back home ? CARLOS FAVA My mama got enough troubles . JOSE How ' bout your daddy ? He still alive ? CARLOS FAVA Oh , yeah . JOSE Living with your mama ? CARLOS FAVA No , old Papi do n't live there . He live right in his laundromat up in Harlem . Cleanest place on the block . Nice and hot , in the winter . Sometimes I walk by , look in the window , and see old Papi sittin ' in the steam , smokin ' a cigar and watchin ' his TV like he ai n't got a care in the world . When I see him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goddam throat with the glass . p. 27 JOSE Hey , you and me got a lot in common ! We both a couple a murderers ! CARLOS FAVA You make too many jokes . JOSE Tony and me , we used to tell jokes all the time . Did I tell you the one about the guy from Mexico who wanted to win the lottery ? CARLOS FAVA Forget it . JOSE I 'm just trying to get to know you . CARLOS FAVA ( Turns his back to her . ) Believe me : this is one person you do n't wan na know . JOSE Well , anyway . ( Picks up the blue bear and strokes it . ) If you need a place to sleep , I got this big mattress . CARLOS FAVA ( His back still to her . ) Okay , Ho-say . ( From this point on , CARLOS calls JOSE " HO-SAY , " although everyone else rhymes her name with " toes . " Lights dim out on CARLOS and JOSE , up on benches where LOWANDA and DALLAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the hissing sound of trains in the distance . ) LOWANDA ( Waking and sitting up . ) Later and later it 's getting , every minute . JOSE ( Entering with coffee and sandwiches . ) Hey ! Here 's the coffee and sandwich lady . ( Handing LOWANDA her coffee . ) I put plenty a mild and sugar . Careful , it 's hot . p. 28 LOWANDA ( Drinks a few sips . When a train down below grinds to a noisy stop , she listens intently . ) Hunh . You hear that ? She coming closer . JOSE That 's just the train . LOWANDA That the Angel of Death screaming . She some hungry lady . JOSE ( Unwrapping a sandwich . ) Here , have some sandwich . I got one baloney and one cheese . Which one you want ? LOWANDA Baloney . ( Grabbing sandwich from JOSE . ) Eat for Death . Such a smart lady , goes for alla the old people first , saves young girls for last . Like dessert . JOSE Can you hold this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOWANDA Death gon na eat you , Jose , you do n't get outta here . You falling right into her big open mouth . JOSE Oh , I 'm okay . I think I got a new guy . Name 's Carlos . He 'll take care a me . LOWANDA Do n't trust no men . ( As she eats her sandwich . ) They got this hole in their brains , where God pulled out a piece to make women . DALLAS I hear you Lowanda . I hear you eating . You ca n't fool me . That dirty girl brought sandwiches and coffee , and I want mine . Hurry up , now ! p. 29 JOSE ( Brings DALLAS her food . ) Here . I did n't wan na wake you up . DALLAS Dallas never sleeps . You think people sleep in Hell ? ( She takes a bite of the plastic-wrapped sandwich . ) What 's the matter with this sandwich ? My teeth bounce right off the bread . ( She explores sandwich with her tongue and fingers while JOSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic on ! You want me to die ? JOSE Here , drink the coffee , and I 'll take the plastic off . I forgot about it . DALLAS ( Takes coffee and sips it with one finger extended . ) Any time you do something , you do it with your whole self . Otherwise , forget about it . LOWANDA ( Leaning toward DALLAS and gesturing with her sandwich . ) That why you living down here , Dallas ? DALLAS When I lived at the Biltmore Hotel , maids stole all my jewelry . Here , they leave me alone . JOSE ( Handing DALLAS her unwrapped sandwich . ) It 's okay now , Dallas . LOWANDA All the maids down here , they leave you alone , hunh ? How ' bout the butler , old woman ? He touch your jewels ? p. 30 DALLAS Trash ! Making fun of blind people . Who knows what we see with our secret eyes ?

DALLAS I have teeth . LOWANDA ( Applauds . ) Thank God you got something since they took your eyes . DALLAS Yes . I was playing Lady Macbeth , and Macbeth hit me with a chair . Such a violent man he was . We were living together , you know , and he was so lovely each time after he hurt me . I 'm sorry , Dallas , he 'd cry . Sorry , sorry , such big tears rolling right down onto his collar .

CARLOS FAVA Did n't have no place else to watch it . JOSE Oh . ( Beat . ) Okay . ( Watching him curiously . ) You ought a try some whisky . Makes you feel warm inside , like somebody loves you .

Now I 'm on my own time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARLOS FAVA Shut your face ! JOSE You do n't wan na talk about it ?

JOSE I had a lotta great experiences with my old man before I chunked him up in the food processor and fed him to the dogs . ( Beat . ) Almost did with my step-daddy , too . And I could with Sgt. Frank . CARLOS FAVA Shit ! You stay away from that dude . I seen you talkin ' to him . JOSE You did ? When ? CARLOS FAVA ( Looking away , he relights the joint . ) I watch you sometimes .

JOSE ( Pulling a bag of peanuts out of her knapsack . ) I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share . ( She sits down next to him , opens peanut bag and coke , offers him some . ) One thing you got ta be careful of down here is the rats . One time I forgot and left half a sandwich , another time some popcorn . Those rats 'll eat anything , even the plastic bags ! p. 36 CARLOS FAVA ( Eating peanuts , but still watching TV . ) They eat kids like you , too . JOSE ( Also eating . ) I ai n't a kid ! Anyway , I spray the place before I sleep . And if that do n't work , I go off into the tunnels , places even the rats do n't know . You wan na go with me sometime ? CARLOS FAVA Maybe . ( He looks at her attentively for the first time . ) How come you dressed like a boy ? JOSE Why you wan na know ? CARLOS FAVA I do n't like it . JOSE Yeah ? Well , it 's protection .

JOSE But if we did , you 'd hit me . Right ? CARLOS FAVA ( Grabs her shoulder . ) Lissen , Jose : Your old man hit your mama ? JOSE Yeah . CARLOS FAVA He hit you ? JOSE Sometimes . CARLOS FAVA Your mama hit you ? JOSE She did till one time I pulled a knife on her . Then she did n't no more , but I do n't remember that too clear , because I was officially insane . CARLOS FAVA What 're you sayin ' ? JOSE Six months in the crazy ward at City Hospital . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a my life . Every day I saw Tony and talked to him . CARLOS FAVA Who 's Tony ? JOSE My brother ! What 's the matter with you ! Do n't you fucking remember anything ? CARLOS FAVA Sorry , baby . JOSE Tony never hit nobody , he just walked away when he did n't wan na be around . He 'd gim me a kiss , and he was out , into the rain or snow . I 'd watch his skinny shadow under the street lights with the red Nite Owl sign blinking on and off . p. 38 CARLOS FAVA Okay , Tony , he walked away . That was cool . JOSE Yeah , that was real cool . Especially the day after Christmas when he got into his fucking Chevy and slammed it into a fucking brick wall . CARLOS FAVA Shit ! JOSE Cops said he skidded on the ice , because Mama told ' em we were such a fucking happy family . ( Closes her eyes to stop the tears . ) I guess he died from an overdose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness . ) Your father and I love you , Jose . JOSE Did I tell you that joke about the guy who wanted to win the lottery ? LANI THOMPSON Josephine ? Open that door . Carl loves you , now you know that . This is for your own good . CARLOS FAVA ( Agitated , he turns off TV , jumps up . ) What I say is , I hate that shit ! These words , man , they give us these words while they kickin ' us and hittin ' us . Like we supposed to use words to wipe out the pain . JOSE ( Trying to calm him down . ) Okay . Okay . CARLOS FAVA ( Pacing back and forth . ) I do n't wan na hear no love talk outta people whose mouths is fulla blood ! Like my papi , he think he can clean hisself up by runnin ' a laundry and sittin ' in the steam ! Well , I seen my mama plenty times lyin ' on the floor , tellin ' me through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! And I say , love is like a dirty word in this world . p. 39 JOSE Yeah , but maybe , if you loved me CARLOS FAVA Forget about it . JOSE Well , just maybe , y'know . I mean , you would n't have to say anything . And you would n't have to hit me , either . CARLOS FAVA You can keep the TV . ( He exits . ) JOSE But I would like a baby . And a big house , where we could live by ourselves . Okay ? Because I think kids ought a live without grownups . ( She begins to prop up her stuffed animals in a group on the bed . ) So that 's why kids ought a have babies when they 're kids , and when they get too old , they ought a go somewhere else , where they could n't touch the kids . ( Addressing the stuffed animals . ) Whaddya think , guys ? ( Closing her eyes . ) Whaddya think , Tony ? ( Lights out on JOSE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , very far away , screeching to a stop . Silence , then the wailing of the wind echoing in the underground chambers . Lights up on LOWANDA and DALLAS on their respective benches , under mounds of newspaper . ) LOWANDA ( Wailing along with the wind . ) Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ! p. 40 DALLAS ( Without raising her head . ) Shut up ! LOWANDA It 's cold down here ! What happened to the heat ? DALLAS ( Raising herself up on her elbow . ) At the Biltmore I wore red lipstick . LOWANDA ( Also half-sitting , rearranging the news-papers over her feet . ) I need blankets and sandwiches ! I did n't eat anything for too long is why I 'm cold . DALLAS Jose brought us sandwiches . ( Beat . ) We ate caviar with sour cream at the funeral for my eyes . LOWANDA Ahhhhhhhh ! My toes is blue ! Somebody stole my shoes ! DALLAS I do n't think you ever had shoes . Not like me . I had shoes , oh , yes , at the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sweet little shoes . LOWANDA Someday I 'm gon na have more shoes than you , you can bet . You old bat . ( She shivers violently . ) Ahhhhhhhhhhhh ! JOSE ( Enters with blankets . ) Hey , Dallas . Hey , Lowanda . I do n't know how come it 's so cold down here , but I 'm bringing you some blankets . LOWANDA Oh , Jose , you like a little angel . Lookit my toes . They gon na fall off from the cold . Frostbite , I 'm gon na get down here . p. 41 JOSE ( Wrapping a blanket around LOWANDA 'S feet . ) Yeah , your feet sure are blue . Maybe this blanket 's not enough . I got to find you another sweater . LOWANDA Or a coat , maybe ? And some hot soup ? JOSE Yeah , sure . ( Crossing to DALLAS , wrapping blanket around her . ) Here , Dallas . This better ? DALLAS ( Muttering to herself . ) No , no , no , no , NO ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , never , never , NEVER ! AHA ! ( She rummages around in her tangled hair . ) I hate these tangles . What do they take me for , anyway ? They want me to lie around with my hair uncombed all day ? ( Pulling something out of her hair . ) Here it is . One of them bugs , just the kind I remember . That 's a roach , I can tell by the feel of it . LOWANDA Wan na feel my travel iron ? DALLAS I 've felt that damn thing too many times now . In case you did n't notice , it never gets hot . LOWANDA Whaddya expect ? I 'd haveta plug it in . DALLAS Someday you 'll plug it in and find out it does n't work . And probably never did , even though you remember ironing twenty-seven nylon stockings with it just ten years ago . That 's the way things are , in case you did n't notice . ( Still feeling around in her hair . ) Ha ! Got another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got a comb . Turn around . ( JOSE takes out her comb , DALLAS turns around obediently , and JOSE gently combs DALLAS ' hair . ) LOWANDA Who 's got time to iron stockings ? DALLAS Oh , we 've all got time , in between this and that and the pressures of waking and sleeping . Suddenly a door opens , and there 's the ironing board , waiting , with your stockings piled up at one end like a mound of Easter eggs . LOWANDA You got some eggs ? I sure am hungry . DALLAS That 's how it was when I lived in technicolor . Blue is what I most remember , but even that probably is n't as good as I think it was . LOWANDA When I go home , I 'm gon na iron , only the most important things , because in ten years a lotta big things get wrinkled . DALLAS It was the color of a a fat blue crayon , or those tiles I saw once in a Greek church , little chips of sky a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got them color eyes . She say , look right here in my eyes . That 's how she pull you through . JOSE ( She continues to comb DALLAS 'S hair . ) Last night I had this dream : I was wearing my mama 's diamond ring , and it broke in three pieces . Just when I was reaching out for something , but I do n't remember what . p. 43 DALLAS Ow ! Watch out ! Do n't forget my hair 's coming out of my head ! JOSE Sorry . Maybe if you lean forward a little . ( DALLAS leans forward . ) So each one of these ring pieces fell into the ground . Two of ' em started to grow , little bushes with shining red flowers like drops of blood DALLAS I remember red . JOSE But the third one fell down through a hole , like the one Alice fell into . DALLAS Oh , yes . ( Referring to the combing . ) That 's nice , Jose . Do I know Alice ? JOSE You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you something , Jose : that Alice is not your type . JOSE Hold still . So you know what I did ? I went down the hole after that one piece . I could feel myself falling and falling LOWANDA SANDWICH TIME ! JOSE You got ta wait about an hour . DALLAS You got all the bugs ? Thank you , little Jose . ( She feels JOSE 'S face , then pats her cheek . ) Why did they turn off the heat at this hotel ? We paid our bills , did n't we ? p. 44 LOWANDA This ai n't a hotel ; it 's the morgue . JOSE No , lissen . I got a great idea . You , me and Dallas , we 're gon na get outta here . We 're gon na live in a big house someday , with a TV in every room . Whaddya think ? LOWANDA Yeah , even the bathrooms . I wan na watch game shows when I 'm taking a shit . DALLAS Ladies do n't shit ; they excrete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOWANDA Sure . Ai n't it time for the food truck ? DALLAS They excrete strawberry ice cream . JOSE Yeah , and pistashio on the weekends . LOWANDA I never been so hungry ! DALLAS Oh , yes , you 're always . You could eat a hundred sandwiches a day , and your whining would still sound like an air raid siren . LOWANDA A hundred sandwiches on white bread . I 'd eat till I busted open . Got any wine , Jose ? JOSE No , but I got a little whiskey . ( She pulls out a small bottle and gives each of them a drink . ) I should 've thought of this before , to warm you up . ( She takes a drink herself. ) p. 45 DALLAS Pretty good for cheap stuff . JOSE What 's the matter with your face , Dallas ? You got sores all over , especially around your mouth . DALLAS Do I ? I hurt everywhere , so I did n't notice . ( She feels her face and mouth . ) Yes , yes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll pick up some first aid stuff when I get the sandwiches . LOWANDA And cigarettes ?

And more whiskey , please . JOSE ( Gives DALLAS another drink . ) Take my smoke . I got more . ( She puts cigarette in DALLAS 'S mouth . ) LOWANDA Hey , Jose , you wan na see my travel iron ? JOSE ( Lighting herself another cigarette . ) Sure . LOWANDA ( Displays her iron . ) Nice , see ? Still shiny , even at the bottom . Wan na feel how smooth ? p. 46 JOSE Sure . Nice . LOWANDA This is how I 'm gon na straighten everything out when I live in a nice place again . Gon na have a big bed with satin covers in a big room with big windows . And white curtains . JOSE Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and I swear when I go , I 'm taking you with me . DALLAS That would be sweet , Jose . Very sweet . JOSE And you know one thing we 're gon na have in this house of ours ? Dogs and cats . Lots of ' em . All the lost , skinny dogs and cats , we 'll feed ' em and brush ' em till they 're fat and silky , and they all can sleep on our beds . DALLAS I do n't want to sleep with animals , Jose . All that hot breath and scratching . And fleas . LOWANDA You got so many bugs , Dallas , whaddya you care ? DALLAS Now I got bugs , now , because this place is n't so nice . And someone turned off the hot water . But when we live with Jose , I 'm having a shower every day and washing my hair . JOSE Sure , Dallas . You can have your own private bath . DALLAS I 've got to find a bathroom now , Jose . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . I 'm strong . p. 47 LOWANDA ( Waving newspapers at them . ) Jose , you help that blind old lady take a shit . Lowanda 's tired a helping . JOSE ( As LOWANDA scrambles for the whiskey bottle , JOSE keeps talking to DALLAS until they are out of view . ) Dallas , you got ta be open to the animals . Our dogs ' n cats 're gon na be clean , no bugs at all , and they 're gon na be so sweet and kind As lights dim out on JOSE and the old women , a single light picks up Mrs. THOMPSON and SGT FRANK . ) SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Something has got ta be done , Mrs. Thompson . You 've got ta take responsibility . LANI THOMPSON I 'm tired . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI If you do n't take her back fast , I got ta report to Child Welfare . They 're gon na put her in a foster home . LANI THOMPSON She wo n't stay there either . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I do . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI I can see she ai n't easy , but she got a great heart . And I do n't want her giving it to the wrong people . LANI THOMPSON Tony was the only one who had any influence on her . p. 48 SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Yeah . LANI THOMPSON Jose had this thing with animals . The summer before Tony.left , Jose had a black kitten with long hair and big yellow eyes JOSE ( Enters as SGT . FRANK backs into the shadows . ) Mama , where 's the kitten ? LANI THOMPSON I do n't know . She must be in your room . JOSE No . I looked . And she did n't come out to meet me . LANI THOMPSON Maybe she 's sleeping under the bed . JOSE No , she 's not . Did Tony take her to night school with him ? LANI THOMPSON Why would he do that , Jose ? JOSE I do n't know . Maybe to show his friends ? LANI THOMPSON Kittens do n't belong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe she followed Tony to school . I 'm gon na look outside . ( She exits . ) LANI THOMPSON ( Calling after her . ) Do n't go out now , Jose . Dinner 's almost ready . We 'll find the kitten later . JOSE ( An offstage wail . ) Mama ! She 's dead , Mama ! Somebody killed her , right here in the street ! MAMA ! ( SGT FRANK returns to Mrs. THOMPSON 's side. ) p. 49 LANI THOMPSON What could I say ? Nobody killed her . She got run over . That 's what happens in the city . All the time . But not to Jose 's kitten , no , that kitten had to be killed , and it had to be my fault . Because if it was n't , it would 've been Tony 's . ( PAUSE . ) Maybe it was my fault . I do n't know . I could n't hold onto anything , not her father , not Tony , not Jose . That time she ran away for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus . Holding an empty whiskey bottle , Tony said , and when she opened her eyes , the first thing she said was , " I hate Mama . " ( Lights up on bathroom area . JOSE and CARLOS are lying on the mattress watching TV . We see the flickering screen , but the sound  --  Latin music  --  is very low . ) JOSE I got ta admit , I like being here with you . Y'know ? CARLOS FAVA Yeah . JOSE ( PAUSE . ) Hey . You think there 's a God ? CARLOS FAVA I do n't know . Maybe . Some kind a god that lives in the church and do n't look out at the fucked-up world he lives in . JOSE I think there 's a God , and I think all the shit that happens is his fault . Now that my daddy 's dead . For a while I thought it was Mama 's fault , especially after Tony , but I 'm not mad now . I just hate her in a plain sort of way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the last . She said , " I hate you ! " when I would n't believe her lies about her father . And then he left us . Then when Tony ( Beat . ) She tried to kill me . I told her to go ahead . Did she tell you that ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI No , she did n't . LANI THOMPSON What was there to live for ? With the men gone , we did n't have a family . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI You had you and Jose . LANI THOMPSON I wish I was different . I wish I was strong and could stop everything from crumbling away . But I 'm not . I 'm a person who does n't even make a shadow in the afternoon sun . And I 'm a person who does n't want her daughter to live with her anymore . Not now . ( LIGHTS OUT ON HER AREA . ) CARLOS FAVA You should n't hate your mama . JOSE Yeah , well , I 'm not into forgiveness . CARLOS FAVA Mamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay off , okay ? I want you to tell me what to do , I 'll let you know . This is my place you 're hanging out in . CARLOS FAVA ( Getting up . ) Okay . I 'm outta here . p. 51 JOSE Where you going ? CARLOS FAVA Got ta work . JOSE ( Reaching for him . ) Hey . No , I do n't want you to go . You can tell me what to do sometimes . CARLOS FAVA Yeah ? JOSE Yeah . If you 're real fucking careful . CARLOS FAVA Okay . But I got ta go soon . ( He sits down next to her again . ) JOSE You like doing that ? Hustling guys ? CARLOS FAVA How many times I got ta say ? I do it for the cash . JOSE You close your eyes when you 're doing it and pretend you 're somewhere else ? CARLOS FAVA Look , Jos , there 's too many kids like you hustlin ' , livin ' like a roach . They got old faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl . You no older than my sister Joanna . If she went out on the streets , I 'd kill her . JOSE Yeah , but I need the money . I do n't get enough stealing , and I 'm sick a Frank . He do n't give nothing for nothing . CARLOS FAVA ( Taking money out of his jacket . ) Here . You need cash , you just ask me. p. 52 JOSE No , lissen : what if you and me got jobs somewhere ? CARLOS FAVA I do n't know how to do nothin ' but hustle . And make movies . JOSE Yeah , those kind a movies . No , I mean , maybe we could work in a store selling something like sandwiches , or tee shirts , or even , y'know , music equipment , which I know a lot about . CARLOS FAVA You do n't make money sellin ' stuff in stores . And you too young . JOSE Well , shit , I got no choice then , do I ? Because I wan na get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Lowanda and Dallas with me . You wan na come ? We 're gon na go someplace real beautiful , like California . I mean it . We 're gon na live by an ocean , with trees and grass and flowers . Every morning we 're gon na wake up and smell roses . CARLOS FAVA Okay , but do n't hustle , Jos . You hear me ? JOSE You know what ? I love you . CARLOS FAVA No . Do n't do it . JOSE Why not ? You do n't love me ? CARLOS FAVA ( No looking at her . ) If I could love anybody But I been livin ' too foul . I do n't touch women . I sell myself to johns only and I 'm not gay . I go down on them , they go down on me , and I feel nothin ' . ( Beat . ) Except sometimes I get high on the power I got . I see my old papi Carlos down on his knees like the rest of the guys . Worshippin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you do n't like to touch women , but could we just  --  I mean , only for a second  --  hold hands ? And then , if it 's real awful , we do n't have to do it again . CARLOS FAVA ( Turning to her and extending his hand tentatively . ) Okay . JOSE ( Taking his hand . ) Okay . ( BEAT . ) Hey , remember when you said you had all those names ? CARLOS FAVA Yeah . JOSE Say ' em again ! CARLOS FAVA Carlos , Juan , Pedro , Pedro , Christos , Jesus , Maria Fava . JOSE Where 'd you get ' em all ? CARLOS FAVA What you wan na know for ? JOSE Because . CARLOS FAVA ( PAUSE , as he considers . ) Okay . I got a name from each one of my mama 's lovers after my papi left . What a tough guy , big Carlos . Used to beat my mama up and make me watch . Then later , in the dark , I 'd hear this puffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the difference between fuckin ' and beatin ' people up . I tried to make Mama see , but she kept goin ' for the same type of guy , over and over , till she was one purple and yellow bruise . p. 54 CARLOS FAVA ( cont 'd ) ( PAUSE . ) Then she found Maria . I said , Hey , Mama , you crazy ? This is a woman . Yeah , Honey , Mama said . But I ai n't had no luck with men . ( CARLOS withdraws his hand from JOSE 's . ) Now , sometimes when I stop by to drop off some cash , I see them laughin ' and talkin ' , paintin ' each other 's fingernails . I try to figure it out . Maybe men and women ca n't be together . Maybe the only reason they 're ever together is to make babies , and maybe we do n't need babies anymore . JOSE Yeah . Well , maybe you do n't . But I sure do . ( Somewhere in this subterranean world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bathroom area , up on LOWANDA and DALLAS , who are walking around , DALLAS leaning on LOWANDA , and both of them wrapped in blankets which trail behind them . ) LOWANDA Something bad gon na happen , I feel it in my elbows . DALLAS What do you know about anything ? LOWANDA A lot , I tell you , especially in my elbows , who never lie . DALLAS Now there are nothing but lies , and it 's been that way a long time .

DALLAS What color did you say mine are ? LOWANDA Yellow . p. 56 DALLAS Oh . That 's odd . I keep seeing my feet in little red shoes . JOSE ( Enters with CARLOS . ) Hey , Lowanda ! Hey , Dallas !

I want to feel his face . JOSE ( CARLOS starts to back away , but JOSE grabs his hand . ) It 's okay . Please ?

( TO CARLOS . ) Good morning , I 'm Dallas . Is it morning ? JOSE No , it 's night time . DALLAS Good night , then . JOSE ( Pulling a bottle from her pocket . ) Who wants a drink ? DALLAS I do .

FRANK BIAGGI So when I see her hangin ' out with that Carlos guy who 's draggin ' her down into bad shit  --  if you 'll excuse my language  --  I get more than just worried . Y'unnerstand me ? LANI THOMPSON I do n't want her to get hurt , Sgt. Frank . I do love her . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI You got ta get her back . LANI THOMPSON She hates it here . Oh , I know she forgets ; sometimes she gets lonely . But she would n't really come back . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Not on her own , she wo n't . You got ta go and get her . LANI THOMPSON How do you think I could do that ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI I 'm not here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I could just go to Port Authority and say , " Jose , you 've got to come back now , " and she 'd do it ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI No . I do n't think so . LANI THOMPSON And then , what if she did come back ? Fights all the time , stealing money . Showing up at the beauty salon , throwing fits in front of the customers , trying to get me fired . I need that job . p. 87 SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Seems to me you got everything figured out in advance , Mrs. Thompson , and it 's always negative . Now , if I was Jose 's mother LANI THOMPSON That 's easy for you to say , is n't it ? You do n't know me and you ca n't be a mother , but because you 're a man and wearing a badge , you can tell me how to run my life . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI ( Losing his cool , he yells in frustration . ) This is not some fucking game ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't yell at me . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI That kid is dying to have you rescue her ! All that kid wants to know is you love her and need her and you 'll do whatever you can to make it possible for her to come home . LANI THOMPSON She wo n't listen . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI That 's because Jose knows you do n't mean it , Mrs. Thompson . She 'll lissen when you talk from your heart . I do n't need to be a mother to know that . Because everybody 's the same on that score , y'unnerstand me ? LANI THOMPSON I suppose . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Okay . I said what I got to say . ( He turns away , then stops and turns back . ) But sometimes the adults got ta make the effort . Because it 's a lot to ask kids to do it all the time . And this is a goddamn fourteen-year-old kid we 're messing around with ! ( Guilt-ridden , LANI stands rooted to the spot as lights cross fade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watches , and JOSE is removing more from her bra and her boots and her upper arms under her sweater. ) p. 88 CARLOS FAVA This is it , baby ! You the perfect thief . JOSE Yeah , I got all kinds a talent . CARLOS FAVA You and me . We can get all the shit we want . JOSE Got any now ? CARLOS FAVA Do I look like a man that 's high ? I got ta take this stuff and do some distributin ' . JOSE Where you gon na sell ' em ? CARLOS FAVA ( Stuffing watches in his pockets . ) Do n't ask . You should n't know too much . JOSE You know something ? I wan na decide how much I should know . CARLOS FAVA Look , baby , you 're just a girl . JOSE Right . When I 'm stealing watches , I 'm your partner . But when I wan na know something , I 'm just a fucking girl . CARLOS FAVA Whaddya want from me ? I treat you nice , do n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just thought , y'know , for a guy who 's gon na be a father CARLOS FAVA What ? JOSE Yeah . I was waiting to surprise you , in case you did n't notice . I guess I 'm pregnant . p. 89 CARLOS FAVA You ca n't be . JOSE Sure I can . From the other night . CARLOS FAVA You ca n't be a mother ; you 're just a kid . JOSE Oh , I been waiting to be a mother for a long time . Maybe always . Lissen , y'know , we 're gon na be a family now . We 're gon na do things different from our old fucked-up families . No more living like a roach . We 're gon na be fine . CARLOS FAVA I ca n't be a fuckin ' father ! JOSE Sure you can . It 's easy when you got a good heart . CARLOS FAVA No , Jos . You still do n't know me . I got a bad heart , worse than any heart you ever thought of . I am shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine is ever gon na come into this world ! JOSE Un-hunh . Well , this is my kid too , and I say different . ( Lights cross fade to LOWANDA and DALLAS . JOSE enters , carrying sandwiches and coffee . She is restless and jittery . ) LOWANDA You got food , Jose ? DALLAS Sandwiches ? LOWANDA What kinda sandwiches ? I been thinking about turkey , sliced real thick , with mayonnaise. p. 90 JOSE I do n't know . I think it 's tuna again . DALLAS ( Reaching out for hers . ) I like tuna , Jose . And I smell the coffee . LOWANDA ( TO DALLAS . ) Whaddya mean , you smell ? You stink , like me . Like this whole stinking place . DALLAS Coffee , that 's what I smell ! Not you or me . I got used to us . JOSE ( Handing them coffee and sandwiches . ) I put lots a milk and sugar in the coffees . Here , Dallas , I 'll unwrap it for you . ( JOSE tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That fucking Carlos do n't wan na have this baby . LOWANDA Get rid a him , Jose . DALLAS ( As she 's eating . ) We do n't need him to have our baby . We 'll do just fine on our own . LOWANDA You got any money saved yet ? Maybe it 's time we should go . DALLAS I have been feeling restless . JOSE No , I got no money anymore . I been giving it all to him . LOWANDA What for ? He ca n't get his own cash ? p. 91 JOSE Well , we been getting high a lot , and it costs . LOWANDA Quit that shit , Jose . Just drink . Costs less and it 's better for the baby . JOSE Yeah , but I really like it . Takes the top of my head off , y'know , like I 'm going fast on this elevator up through the roof and right into the stars . Whiskey 's different . It 's warm and slow and dizzy . But you stay down here on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A hot bath , maybe for two hours . With bubbles in it . And I 'll never get it if we do n't get to our house by the seashore . LOWANDA Ca n't always get what you want . Time you both learned that one . JOSE Lissen , maybe I 'll get outta here for a while and pick up some cash . Then I 'll come back to get you . DALLAS Do n't leave us , Jose . I 've got bugs in my armpits . JOSE I 'm not talking really leaving . I got no place to go and nobody to be with but you . DALLAS Maybe you 'd like to sell my little gold picture frame , Jose ? JOSE Hell , no ! That 's important to you , Dallas . DALLAS Yes , but When I think about standing with my feet in the ocean , squishing my toes in the wet sand , listening to the waves rumble like lovers p. 92 JOSE Okay , I got an idea . Just give me twenty-four hours , and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . LOWANDA Do n't get yourself hurt , honey . JOSE No , this is something I can do with my eyes closed . It ai n't gon na hurt much at all . DALLAS In one day I 'm going to walk right into the ocean and feel the spray on my face ? JOSE Absolutely . You got my word . We 're all gon na be together at the seashore . ( Lights cross fade to SGT FRANK , standing by kiosk . He keeps glancing at his watch , finally sees JOSE approaching . His face lights up ; then he replaces his delight in seeing her with a stern , fatherly face . ) SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Where you been ? I been waiting half an hour . JOSE I got held up on official business . See , there was this meeting with some guys from the planet Mars SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Yeah , yeah . Put the crap in a can and bury it . JOSE You ai n't happy to see me ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Not when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to go . ) Okay . p. 93 SGT . FRANK BIAGGI ( Grabs her arm . ) What 're you doing ? JOSE Well , if you 're tired of waiting , you probably wan na go home to bed . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Yeah , right . Okay , I 'm sorry . I love waiting . Next time I wo n't say a word . JOSE ( Teasing , provocative . ) Yeah ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Yeah . So what you wan na talk about ? JOSE Lissen , Frank , I need money . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI ( Drops her arm . ) How much ? JOSE I du n no . Five hundred , at least . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI I ai n't got that kinda money . JOSE Yeah , but you could get it . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Why would I wan na do that ? JOSE Because I 'm gon na spend the whole night with you . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI What 're you thinking ? JOSE You can do whatever you want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been thinking about , I 'll do . p. 94 SGT . FRANK BIAGGI No . I do n't do that kinda stuff . JOSE C'm on ! Dressing up , weird positions SGT . FRANK BIAGGI ( Torn between desire and his fatherly impulses . ) And when is this gon na be ? JOSE It 's got ta be tonight . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI I ca n't . JOSE We 'll go to a hotel . Look , Frank , I do n't wan na wait . I need the cash now . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI So that creep can deal more shit ? JOSE No , it got nothing to do with Carlos . This is for me . It 's important . I 'm gon na go straight , Frank , I mean it . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Yeah ? ( BEAT . ) I ca n't do this , Jose . Whaddya think I am ? JOSE Whaddya you care , old man ?

A swirl of smoke , and stark lights up on the bathroom area . ) CARLOS FAVA ( Enters . ) Jos ? JOSE ? C'm on , do n't hide on me . Get out here NOW ! p. 95 LANI THOMPSON ( A voice only . ) Jose ? Jose ? Come back . I 've been dreaming about you crossing this dark river . Do n't drown , darling . CARLOS FAVA Where are you ? Where 'd you put the rest of the cash ? ( Looks frantically around , under mattress , etc . ) C'm on , c'm on , I need it NOW ! ( He swirls around as though someone is behind him . ) Who 's that ? Okay . Come on outta there . ( He advances slowly on unseen assailant . ) I hear you . You ai n't gettin ' away . ( Pulls out a knife , makes short jabs at the air . ) I got you , y'hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Okay . Okay , now . ( Back to the money problem . ) So , where is it ? Fuck , man , this ai n't funny . ( He slashes with his knife at the mattress , rips it open , looking for the money . ) Got ta get some , got ta have it . ( Stands , thinking in a jittery way . Then he gets an idea . ) Oh , yeah . All right . ( He pockets the knife and runs out . ) ( Lights cross fade to LOWANDA and DALLAS , sleeping on their benches . CARLOS enters , hurried but quiet . He crosses to DALLAS and rummages around for her gold picture frame. ) p. 96 DALLAS ( Cries out in her sleep . ) Ahhhhhhhhhh ! CARLOS FAVA You just go right on sleepin ' , old lady , you know what 's good for you . DALLAS Who 's there ? LOWANDA Who 's that ? ( She sits up , sees CARLOS . ) Hey , it 's Jose 's boy ! Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( CARLOS finds the picture frame , but DALLAS grabs his arm . ) DALLAS He 's taking my gold picture ! ( TO CARLOS . ) Let that go . It 's all I 've got left . CARLOS FAVA Look , old lady , I do n't wan na hurt you . So take your fuckin ' hand off my arm . LOWANDA ( Grabs her travel iron and advances on CARLOS . ) Get outta here now or I 'm gon na smash you . CARLOS FAVA With what ? That little thing ? ( He suddenly realizes the iron is worth some money . ) Yeah , okay . Gim me that . I 'm gon na sell that , too . ( He jerkes away from DALLAS and tries to grab the iron , which LOWANDA is waving at him . ) LOWANDA ( Struggling with him . ) I kill you if you hurt it . p. 97 CARLOS FAVA ( He tries to peel LOWANDA 'S fingers away from the handle . ) Yeah , I 'm scared a you , big woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron away , but DALLAS hits him from behind . He swings around . LOWANDA kicks him hard in the shins . ) CARLOS FAVA Hey ! ( He turns back , and as he does , he hits LOWANDA backhand in the face with the iron . ) LOWANDA ( As she falls . ) Aieeeeee ! DALLAS What happened ? Lowanda ? Where are you ? CARLOS FAVA ( Shocked by what he has done , he bends over LOWANDA , touches her face . She does n't respond . He shakes her ; no response . ) Oh , shit , oh , shit , oh , shit ! I 'm outta here ! ( He runs out with the iron and the picture frame . ) DALLAS ( Feeling her way toward LOWANDA 'S body . ) Where are you , old crocodile ? Where are you , my darling ? ( Her foot bumps LOWANDA 's body . She gasps and slowly lowers herself , hands out , to the floor , where she kneels , feeling LOWANDA 's face . ) Oh , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bathroom area. ) p. 98 CARLOS FAVA ( Runs in looking for JOSE . ) I did n't mean it , baby , I did n't mean it . She gon na be okay , that old dame . JOSE ! Where are you ? Oh , fuck , I got ta get outta here ! ( Realizing he 's holding picture frame and iron . Sets them down in a corner . ) Give it back to the old dames . ( Starts to run out , stops , whispers frantically . ) You were s'posed to wait for me , baby . ( He runs out . ) ( In the darkness we hear a screeching of train brakes , a crash and an explosion . Lights up on JOSE waiting by kiosk . ) JOSE ( Consulting her watches . ) What the hell . ( Sees SGT FRANK hurrying up . ) So how goddamn long does it take to go to a goddamn bank ? ( Sees his hesitation . ) SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Lissen , Jose , I got something to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money , Frank . I did everything I could . It was n't my fault you did n't touch me . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI I ai n't talking money right now . JOSE Yeah ? Well , I am . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI No , I I just heard something you ought a know . p. 99 JOSE What ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI About those old dames you take care of . JOSE What about ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI This is bad , Jose . The big , black woman is dead . JOSE What ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Smashed right in the forehead , all caved in . And you know who they think done it ? ( No response from JOSE . ) That guy a yours . The old , blind lady said she heard his voice . JOSE ( Beating at SGT FRANK with her fists . ) Cut it out , Frank ! Do n't tell me this crap ! Carlos would n't do nothing like that ! I just saw Lowanda and Dallas . yesterday . They were fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . JOSE NO ! Everything 's fine ! We 're going to the seashore . ( She starts to run off , then turns back . ) Where are they ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Down to the morgue . But your guy run off . We got everybody out looking for him . JOSE ( Running . ) Noooo ! NO ! I did n't hear nothing you said ! You fucking liar ! p. 100 SGT . FRANK BIAGGI ( Calling after her . ) Jose ! Jose ? ( Pulling new bills out of his wallet and counting them , he says , more to himself . ) You still want your money ? ( Lights out on benches . In the darkness we hear the Dylan song , " Tambourine Man " and the rumble and roar of the trains . Then lights up slowly on JOSE , in bathroom . She sits on the mattress , gun in her hand , surrounded by her stuffed animals . The cassette player near her plays the Dylan song . ) JOSE Did n't leave me one fucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , he could 've had my mother . Or me . I 'm dead already . ( Deep breath . ) Okay , I guess I got ta do it . I mean , why not , y'know ? I could 've thought of plenty of reasons , like having our own family and all , but I do n't know , the way things are coming down See , if there were just this one person left I could talk to , I mean , really talk ( Looking upward . ) So , whaddya think , Tony ? Do n't it seem like the best thing ? Yeah ? And then we 'll probably be together , after . I mean , seems like you been waiting for me . ( She inspects gun . ) I wonder what it feels like . One minute you 're here , with your eyes open , looking around , and then what ? Pain ? No , probably not . Just dark , I guess . Just nothing . And then , a few minutes later , I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll come and take me somewhere . And then I 'll finally have someone I can be with forever . Y'know ? Somebody who 's not gon na leave or get something outta me but who 'll just be there . And maybe Lowanda 's there too ? So we could have our family anyway . It 'll just be different , that 's all . ( Pulls a stuffed animal onto her lap . ) You coming with me , little girl . Do n't you worry : you got a mama and a grandma and a uncle Tony gon na be with you . ( Addressing the other stuffed animals . ) Stay close to us , you guys . ( Pause . ) Pray for us , okay ? ( She takes a deep breath , clutches stuffed animal as lights fade . ) Shit , I loved that guy ! ( The lights go out . Silence , then a loud gunshot that echoes in the subway chambers . We hear a train start up again , like a slow drum beat , followed by hissing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling her way with her cane. ) p. 101 DALLAS Jose ? It 's Dallas . Lowanda sent me . She said you 're in big trouble . Now , I do n't know , it might have been the Mafia or some bad men from Memphis . You never can tell , can you ? Lowanda said I 've got to get you out of here . She ca n't do it herself . She 's dead , you know . It 's not fair of her , dying that way , and she feels guilty , let me tell you . ( DALLAS ' cane bumps into the mattress . She delicately probes around with the cane until she finds JOSE 'S body . ) Oh , you 're sleeping , are you ? Well , it 's time to get up , my dear . Time to leave while we still can . ( She slowly lowers herself down to mattress . ) What an odd smell . ( Feeling around in sudden panic . ) Jose ? Jose ? ( She sits beside JOSE 'S body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun . ) Oh , no . No , no , no . ( She bends over JOSE 'S body as though over a baby , smoothes JOSE 'S hair . ) Shhhhh . Shhhhh . Do n't cry . ( She rocks back and forth , keening quietly . ) Do n't cry . It was only life . ( SGT FRANK and Mrs. THOMPSON enter UL . ) LANI THOMPSON I do n't know why I said I 'd do this . You know she wo n't come back to me . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Yeah , well , I 'm glad you came , Mrs. Thompson , but I got ta tell you Jose is pretty upset . p. 102 LANI THOMPSON It 's horrible here . Oh , what 's the point ? ( She starts to back away . ) I 'm afraid I can't.do it . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI ( Grabs her arm and pulls her forward . ) Just talk from your heart . Okay , over here is the bathroom where she 's been living with her boyfriend . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of Mrs. THOMPSON . ) DALLAS ( Raises her head . Fierce . ) Do n't come in here . This is a private place . SGT . FRANK BIAGGI Dallas ! What 're you doing ? ( He sees JOSE 'S body . ) Oh , my god ! ( He tries to block Mrs. THOMPSON 'S view . ) We got ta get outta here , Mrs. Thompson . LANI THOMPSON ( Pushing past him , she sees JOSE 'S body . A shocked intake of breath . Then she begins to scream . ) Ahhhhhhh ! DALLAS Would you tell that woman to shut up ? SGT . FRANK BIAGGI ( Putting his arm around Mrs. THOMPSON 'S shoulder , he tries to lead her out . ) C'm on , Mrs. Thompson . DALLAS Who is that terrible woman ? p. 103 SGT . FRANK BIAGGI This here 's Jose 's mother , Dallas . She got a right . DALLAS Oh , no , she 's not her mother . No , no , she 's got no right at all . ( TO LANI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIAGGI ( Guiding the sobbing LANI out . ) Shhh , shhh . Come with me . DALLAS ( Back to addressing JOSE . ) You did n't wait . I was coming . Did you think I 'd gone off and left you ? How could I do that ? I need you , Jose . Oh , my little one . ( She listens intently . ) I remember , Jose . I do . I said I 'd come across that river and bring you back . Now I 've got to bring two of you . ( PAUSE . ) What a black river ! Oh , look , there 's the ferryman , coming right up to the shore . What does he want ? Money ? ( Addressing the invisible ferryman . ) I do n't have anything . No , wait ! Do n't go . My friends are on the other shore . ( She listens . ) Well , how about this ? You take my heart . Why not , I do n't mind . Then , when I get my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She listens again . ) All right , now . All right . ( A beautiful smile , as she " hands over her heart . " ) Thank you . This is not difficult at all . ( She waves her hand , excited . ) See , there they are ! You see those two , standing with their bare feet in the water ? The little one , you know , she 's my daughter . And the other one 's my sister . But who 's that tall boy standing there with them ? p. 104 ( Lights out . End of play. )
