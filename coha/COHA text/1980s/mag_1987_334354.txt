A little national-pride music , maestro . Thank you . Our very own United States of America ( rooty-toot-toot ) makes the best TV beer commercials ( tantara ) in the universe . Nobody else is close , unless it is some race of advertising geniuses in the Crab nebula , and that is not close , and anyway the Crabs do not have John Madden or Mickey Spillane , so forget them . <P> However  --  some really gloomy national-shame music now , if you please  --  it is also true that most of what the U.S. makes and labels as beer ( gronk , honk , sound of oboists performing underwater ) is fizzed up and flavorless , the worst brew in the universe . Why this should be so is puzzling . Other nations do not find it impossible to brew serious beer . The Germans and Austrians are masters , of course . Scandinavians , Dutch and French are experts . Italians see no point in beer , but what they make is drinkable . Mexicans produce good summer-weight cerveza . Canadian beer includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as Moosebreath by truck drivers in the Northeast . Japanese export beer tends to be thin and disappointing , which is to say it tends to taste far better than our mainstream belly wash . For that matter , Ladakhi Buddhists in remote Himalayan valleys make beer better than ours in open earthenware pots , in which dazed microorganisms swim for the shore . Furthermore . . . <P> But it is time to turn off Vermont 's Interstate 91 into White River Junction . White River is an old railroad town and , as some old-timers brag , an old bootlegging town , an old red-light town . Those glories are long gone , and just now it is simply an old town , at the confluence of the White and Connecticut rivers . The surrounding country is some of the handsomest in New England , but there is a scuffling , head-down quality to South Main Street , out by the Legion hall . It is just the place for a brewery , though the last of the old breweries in Vermont went out in the 1890s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Hampshire , the big , mass-market Anheuser-Busch operation in Merrimack . And only one very small outfit in Massachusetts , an enterprising Boston pub called the Commonwealth Brewing Co . Ltd. , which turns out a variety of sturdy ales and porters for consumption on the premises . It is true that the somewhat misleadingly named Boston Beer Co. sells Samuel Adams , a good , chewy boutique lager that yuppies buy for nearly $7 a six-pack on payday , but the stuff is made in Pittsburgh . To the north , Maine Coast Brewing sells a tart , beer-flavored beer called Portland Lager at a stiff $5.35 a pack , but despite the sea gull , lighthouse and sailing ship on its label , Portland is made by a brewery in Eau Claire , Wis.
