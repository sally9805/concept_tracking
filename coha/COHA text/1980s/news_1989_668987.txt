Edmund Gwenn , the actor , lay dying , barely able to speak . Finally his lips parted and everyone leaned close , anxious to hear the final words of the great one . " Dying , " Gwenn muttered , " is easy . Comedy is difficult . " Not for the Bulls , it isn ' t . They died Tuesday in losing 106-98 to the Atlanta Hawks , and they looked pretty funny doing it . Especially the way they threw the ball away 29 times , which accounted for 40 Atlanta points , and got off a season-low 58 shots , which is how many you ' d expect to see in a game of eight-minute quarters . Of course , the Bulls looked a little high schoolish against the Hawks . " We couldn ' t get the ball past halfcourt , " moaned Michael Jordan , who led the Bulls with 32 points despite being weakened by the flu . " We played terrible . We made bad decisions on the break . We didn ' t execute the offense . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many . The turnovers cooked the Bulls , who dropped their seventh home game after losing 11 at the Stadium all of last season and fell to 27-20 , blowing a chance to pass the Hawks ( 29-19 ) in the standings . " We asked ourselves , Are we a fifth-place ballclub ? ' " said the Hawks ' Cliff Levingston . " And we said , We ' re not , so let ' s go out and prove it . ' " That the Hawks did , with a smothering defense that limited Bill Cartwright , who was booed frequently in the second half , to only two shots in 41 minutes . " They fronted Bill and helped on the inside , and it caused us a lot of problems , " said Horace Grant . Actually , almost everything the Hawks did caused the Bulls problems . Led by Dominique Wilkins ' 36 points and Reggie Theus ' 19 points , 8 assists and 5 steals , this was a determined Atlanta team , and not just to square the season series with the Bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize is we bottomed out last week , " said Malone , who had 17 points and 9 rebounds . " This is a new situation . " Which is what the Hawks , picked by many to win the National Basketball Association title this season , discussed Monday in a 90-minute team meeting before staging their own version of the St. Valentine ' s Day Massacre . " One look in Moses ' eyes , " said Glenn " Doc " Rivers , " and I knew we were going to win this game . " Of course , it helped when Wilkins scored 18 points in the first quarter . " We were calling my number early , " said Wilkins , " and I had it going . " The Bulls could blame that on All-Star coach Lenny Wilkens , who played a disappointed Wilkins only 15 minutes for the East squad in Sunday ' s game , prompting Wilkins to say he " should have stayed home . " It was the Bulls who appeared unconvinced that the All-Star break was over Tuesday . " We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig ( Hodges , who participated in Saturday ' s three-point contest ) and I had any reason to be tired . " But the Bulls seemed awfully weary in falling behind 29-24 after one quarter and then 53-39 late in the first half before scoring the last six points of the second quarter . " They just seemed to want it more than we did , " said Grant , who led the Bulls with eight rebounds . The Hawks went back up by 13 after the first 3 minutes of the second half , but with Jordan going on a binge , scoring 13 points and combining with Sam Vincent ( 14 points ) to get the team running , the Bulls cut the Hawks ' lead to 73-72 late in the third quarter . This , however , was a more determined Hawks ' team , not the one that squandered big leads in both previous losses to the Bulls . " Even when they cut it to one , we felt confident , " said Wilkins . " We kept our composure . " And the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they committed a turnover . They also could have pulled within a point with 9 : 31 left , but Jordan missed two free throws . ( Tiring , he missed two more later . ) Then Hawks rookie Duane Ferrell put back a missed shot , Malone hit a jumper , Theus and Rivers added jumpers , Theus scooped in a driving layup down the middle and Atlanta led by nine points with 5 minutes to go and extended the lead to 11 in the last minute . " Tonight we were aggressive , " said Theus , who had 16 points all told in the three previous games against the Bulls . " We played like our backs were against the wall . " Which is where the Bulls could find themselves if they continue to play like they did . Blindfolds , gentlemen ?
