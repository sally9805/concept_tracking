The Washington conference that led to the book Terrorism : How the West Can Win attracted an international galaxy of Cabinet ministers , legislators , military officers and scholars . Some highlights of what they said : <P> " A purely passive defense does not provide enough of a deterrent to terrorism and the states that sponsor it . It is time to think long , hard and seriously about more active means of defense  --  defense through preventive or pre-emptive actions against terrorist groups before they strike . <P> " We will need to strengthen our capabilities in the areas of intelligence and quick reaction . Intelligence will be particularly important , since our societies demand that we know with reasonable clarity just what we are doing and against whom we are acting . Experience has taught us that one of the best deterrents to terrorism is the certainty that swift and sure measures will be taken against those who engage in it . " Clearly there are complicated moral issues here . But there should be no doubt of the democracies ' moral right , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State George Shultz <P> " The most powerful totalitarian state of our time is also the principal supporter and sponsor of international terrorism . In the late 1960s , Soviet theorists began to emphasize the ' armed road ' as the way to achieve power in the western hemisphere . They have set about supporting terrorist groups in this hemisphere . These technicians in violence and propaganda are called national liberation movements . <P> " The United Nations ' acceptance of so-called national liberation movements as legitimate is a good indicator of the moral confusion that has come to surround this view of violence as the preferred method of political action . Since the 1970s , the U.N . General Assembly has passed numerous resolutions asserting its support for the right of ' national liberation movements ' to ' struggle by all means . . . to achieve power . ' It has consistently condemned countries for attempting to defend themselves against terrorist violence . The distinction between legitimate and illegitimate use of force has not so much been blurred as stood on its head . " <P>  --  Former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinction between state and society , public and private , government and individual , the distinction that lies at the heart of humane belief . For the terrorist , as for the totalitarian state , there are no innocent bystanders , no private citizens . Terrorism denies that there is any private sphere , that individuals have any rights or any autonomy separate from or beyond politics . There are thus no standards according to which the individual citizen , or the threatened society , can attempt to come to terms with the totalitarian terrorist . There is no way to satisfy his demands . " <P>  --  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan
