Bear Hug <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> TIME 'S cover of Jan. 15 , 1979 ( below ) , is just as timely for this year . The only change , distressingly enough , is that the contemplative Russian bear depicted there is now on the move : Afghanistan Jan. 7 is caught between its jaws , and paw prints are discernible in Iran and elsewhere around the Persian Gulf . I dread to think what updating will be necessary for your cover a year from now . <P> <P> Edward E. Plowman Washington , D.C. <P> <P> It looks as though we 've just witnessed the birth of the Afghanistan S.S.R. And as in Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 1968 , there is damn little that anyone can do about it . <P> <P> Joseph W. Mosser Rehoboth Beach , Del . <P> <P> The Soviet Union is in Afghanistan because the U.S. is not in Iran . <P> <P> Morris Kessler Plantation , Fla . <P> <P> Soviets in Afghanistan . Soviets in Cuba . Hostages in Iran . I 'm tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we quit talking and kicked somebody . <P> <P> Mike Stroud St. Louis <P> The invasion of Afghanistan lays bare the basic untruths upon which the Soviet state is founded . It did not commit an act of war in the name of Communism . Nay , it did it for the lust of empire . <P> <P> Michael Gold Eugene , Ore . <P> <P> What a pity you did not wait just a little longer to make your Man of the Year award . You could easily have chosen that friendly , honest and trustworthy Soviet fellow who ordered the invasion of Afghanistan , Leonid Brezhnev . <P> <P> William R. Gregory Rensselaer , N. Y. <P> <P> Performance in the Pulpit <P> After a long decline , there does seem to be a renewal of interest in developing preaching skills Dec. 31 . Many of us who came out of the seminaries in the 1950s thought there must be a better way to communicate the message , because preaching seemed to encourage passive congregations and ego-inflated ministers . Preparation and delivery of sermons got less effort than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <P> I myself employed a speech instructor to work with me on my preaching after noticing that I was bored halfway through the sermon . <P> ( The Rev. ) C. Fred Jenkins , Stated Clerk <P> Presbytery of the Western Reserve <P> Cleveland <P> In spite of the admiration I have for the preachers you covered , I still feel the most important things happening in the Body of Christ today probably involve less well-known men and women of God , working in groups of fewer than 100 . <P> Doug Norquist St. Paul <P> As a member of an " unprogrammed " meeting of the Religious Society of Friends ( Quakers ) , I wish your article on preaching had mentioned that many find God without the debatable aid of a hired vocal ministry . <P> William Cooper Martinez , Calif . <P> Some believe that preaching is dead , others think it is dormant , many of us still believe that preaching can be decisive . Thanks for the lift ! <P> ( The Rev. ) James M. Logan <P> Catalina Baptist Church <P> Tucson <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and art investing Dec. 31 , I find myself overwhelmed with rage . Michael Demarest finished his article lamenting " the scarcity of beautiful things . "
