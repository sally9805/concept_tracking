It 's election time , but no dark horses run on this turf <P> At a time when New Hampshire primary voters were heading for the polls , a pleasantly round-faced woman economist named Zinaida Vladimirova Baturina waited for a trolleybus outside the Moscow office building where she works . It was 5 p.m. in the Soviet capital , and the orange glow of twilight hung in the western sky . Twenty minutes later Zinaida Vladimirova reached her destination , a neighborhood campaign office . She had promised to put in an evening 's work as an agitator ( local volunteer ) in the windup of this week 's election of 1,500 deputies to the Supreme Soviet . As she settled beside the telephone , she prepared to advise voters on how to mark their ballots before putting them into the urna ( ballot box ) . <P> New Hampshire it is not . In Soviet elections there are no races among the candidates , no startling upsets in the making , no dark horses snorting in anticipation of last-minute runs . Ever since Lenin dissolved the freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled through interlocking hierarchies : the nonelected Communist Party Politburo and Central Committee , and the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet , which meets in full session only about 48 hours a year . Still , the Soviets insist on going through the motions of an election for this nominal parliament , if only to pay homage to the trappings of democracy . If it were not for the fact that there is practically no freedom of choice , the Soviet electoral process would look almost normal . <P> <P> Getting a 100% turnout of all eligible voters 18 or older is the main task of the million or so agitatori attached to the Soviet Union 's 176,982 electoral commissions . During the 60-day preparation for the elections , teams of two or three agitatori visit every household , from the fruit farms of Moldavia on the Rumanian border to the Eskimo fishing villages of Kamchatka on the Pacific . Some ward-level political banter takes place during these house calls . Irate voters are likely to grumble , " The hot-water system does n't work here " or " When are we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellings in the Soviet Union are assigned by the state , the agitatori are targets for this kind of consumer frustration , and in theory at least , they report the complaints and requests of the electors to local authorities . <P> Very rarely does a Soviet tell the agitatori that he or she does not intend to vote . In Stalin 's time , not voting literally led to a midnight knock on the door and a one-way ticket to Siberia . Now there are no overt punishments , but a notation may be entered in the non-voter 's police file . <P> The voters can drop the ballots into the urna without marking them , signifying assent , or they can step into the booth and cross out the name of the approved candidate , even going so far as to write in another name . The catch-22 is that write-in candidates have no chance ; all winners need official approval . The only suspense is how close to 100% each district can come . Anything below a 99% turnout is unthinkable . After the last elections , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people voting for the official candidate and 185,422 either voting against or writing in another name .
