Will the old guard finally yield to the next generation ? <P> Kremlin receiving lines often provide some clues about who is up and who is down in the Soviet leadership . But when Yuri Andropov failed to appear at the annual gala marking the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution on Nov. 7 , his ten comrades on the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo neatly sidestepped the protocol problem . Instead of forming a line to shake hands with their guests , they bunched together behind their table in a Kremlin banquet hall . It was symbolic confirmation of the vexing problem that faced the Soviet Union as it prepared for the second transition of power in only 15 months : there was no obvious candidate to fill the vacancy left by Andropov . Says Cornell University Political Scientist Myron Rush : " Since nobody is in a strong position , practically everybody is in a strong position . " <P> The rules of thumb that have applied in past races will undoubtedly hold true this time as well . The new Soviet leader will be chosen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to be a member of the powerful party Secretariat , which controls the day-to-day affairs of the Communist Party , and he will probably be an ethnic Russian . To rule effectively , he will have to count on the support of some combination of backers from the three main pillars of Soviet power : the party bureaucracy , the military and the technocratic elite . But imponderables remain . Will the small group of men , whose average age is now 67 , choose a successor from the older group and risk another short-lived regime or will they make the bold decision to turn power over to a younger generation that is thinly represented in the inner circle of power ? <P> Should the Soviet leadership opt for age over youth , there was always standby Candidate Konstantin Chernenko , 72 , who took Andropov 's place on the Lenin Mausoleum during the military parade through Red Square in November and was named chairman of Andropov 's funeral committee last week . Chernenko worked his way to positions on the Politburo and the Secretariat largely by serving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been his boss 's hand-picked heir . But he lost out , probably when the military and party colleagues decided to back Andropov . Since then , Chernenko has given every appearance of being a team player ; he nominated Andropov for the top party post after Brezhnev 's death , and for President of the Soviet Union seven months later . <P> The white-haired , grandfatherly Chernenko might still be the nostalgic favorite of entrenched and aging bureaucrats who remember the old days under Brezhnev . But Chernenko 's experience outside the cumbersome party machine is limited , and he has failed to project an image of strong leadership . The impression has no doubt been reinforced by his unfortunate tendency to stumble over long words while reading prepared speeches .
