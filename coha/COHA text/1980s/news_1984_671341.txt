By the end of this year , the Navy is expected to award a billion-dollar contract for the first of a new type of destroyer , a descendant of those lean and fast " tin can " warships that Hollywood found so attractive in World War II . With American commercial shipbuilding too high priced to compete in the world market , the prospect of such lucrative business from the Defense Department has put three of the nation ' s top shipyards in fierce competition for a program that could generate many tens of billions of dollars into the next century. // Scores of the Arleigh Burke class vessels , also known by the military designation , DDG-51 , are planned through the 1990 ' s . The lead ship ' s price is estimated at $1. 1 billion , with the average cost of later models estimated at $700 million , according to testimony earlier this month before the Senate Armed Services Committee by Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman Jr. // // Field Narrowed to 3 // In 1980 , the Navy initiated design studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field to three : Bath Iron Works , a subsidiary of Congoleum , in Bath , Me . ; Todd Shipyards in Los Angeles , and the Ingalls Shipbuilding division of Litton Industries in Pascagoula , Miss. // There have been worries in industry circles here that Congress might try to reduce the Navy ' s shipbuilding budget by a billion dollars this year , a sum coincidentally close to the cost of the first DDG-51 . A Navy spokesman declined comment on the program , saying the matter is " very sensitive now at budget time. " // " Any new start is vulnerable , " said the Senate majority whip , Ted Stevens , Republican of Alaska , who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee ' s defense subcommittee . " The lead DDG-51 might stay , but it will be tough to get authorization for another. " // The first shots in the DDG-51 budget contest could be fired on Wednesday , when the House Armed Services Committee ' s seapower subcommittee will hold hearings on Navy shipbuilding . Those hearings are designed to evaluate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now is that Senator Stevens is probably correct and that at least one DDG-51 will be built. // The question then becomes whether Bath in Maine , Todd in Los Angeles or Ingalls in Mississippi will get the nod . Analysts watching the development battle seem to feel that Bath and Todd are the likely winners. // <> <> ' Todd Needs the Business ' // " All three companies can build a good ship , " said John Simon , an analyst for Amdec Securities in Los Angeles . " Bath has the lowest hourly labor expenses . Todd needs the business the most , but is the most expensive . Ingalls already has a lot of work and would be the least affected by not getting the contract. " // Mr. Simon said that a failure by Todd to win at least some of the DDG- 51 work " could be virtually a disaster " for the company . If privately held Bath wins , he added , many experts expect it to go public. // Like Mr. Simon , Wolfgang Demisch , an analyst for First Boston in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workload among the three companies , rather than technological factors . " I don ' t think anyone expects Ingalls to get a piece of it , " he said . " Ingalls already has a powerful position with the CG- 47 . Todd is quietly starving , so the Navy might be tempted to go to the West Coast . Bath could be a second- source for the DDG-51 . " ( The CG-47 is a guided-missile cruiser Ingalls is building. ) // Armed with the latest weaponry against planes , missiles , submarines and surface ships , the DDG-51 is intended to protect carriers , supply convoys or other large naval operations . It is the first class of American warship designed with an air-filtration system against nuclear , biological and chemical warfare. // " The DDG-51 represents the future of this shipyard , " said G. J. St. Pe , an Ingalls vice president . " It is very critical and we have an extensive , full-time effort to position ourselves . " The Ingalls position , however , is echoed by the concern ' s competitors. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely important for two reasons , " said James McGregor , a spokesman for Bath . " The commercial shipbuilding market is almost nil , and the backbone of our military work since the mid-1970 ' s - the FFG- 7 Oliver Hazard Perry class guided- missile frigate - will end in 1986 . Unless there is new commercial work , we need the DDG-51 to maintain current work levels. " // The company has competed closely with Todd and Ingalls , Mr. McGregor said , with the Navy choosing Todd as a second source for the FFG-7 . In 1982 , however , it selected Bath as a second source for the CG-47 Aegis guided-missile cruisers , whose lead ship was built by Ingalls . Bath now has contracts for two of these , but the future of the Aegis project at Bath depends on how successfully the company bids head-to-head against Ingalls , Mr. McGregor said . Last fall , Bath received only one out of three. // But Ingalls has had its problems with Congress over shipbuilding in recent years . Last May , the Senate Permanent Subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy contracts with the company . Since then , Ingalls has reached settlements with the Navy and the General Accounting Office on how much the Navy would pay toward modernization costs at the Pascagoula yard . It also recently agreed to return $4 million in overpayments to the Navy. // Nonetheless , Mr. St. Pe called the DDG-51 a " natural opportunity " for Ingalls , given the company ' s work in the late 1960 ' s and 1970 ' s on the Spruance class destroyer fleet , to which the DDG-51 is viewed as a supplement . George A. Sawyer , Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Shipbuilding and Logistics , told the House Appropriations Committee in 1982 that " there is a great deal of similarity in some aspects of DDG-51 and DD-963 , in the propulsion and machinery areas . " The Spruance class is designated DD-963. // <> <> Strategic Reasons Cited // Hans K. Schaefer , president of Todd , said the DDG-51 contract would result in the immediate hiring of 150 engineers and a gradual buildup of some 2 , 000 blue-collar workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead ship provides impetus to the shipyard , " he said . " The Navy may want to keep a West Coast yard viable " for strategic reasons , he added . Out of the projected $1. 1 billion package , about $300 million would go directly to the shipbuilder , with the rest for weapons and support , he said. // It is common Navy practice to select at least two suppliers for major warships , with the low bidder being awarded the lead ship and more follow-on vessels . In the CG-47 competition , Mr. McGregor said , Bath knew Ingalls had an advantage from building the first ship , but hoped to gain on other factors , such as yard efficiency . The company might have suffered from failing to negotiate a contract extension with its union , he said . Its current union contract expires in June 1985. // With both political parties seeking ways to shrink the Pentagon budget this year in the face of skyrocketing Federal deficits , the prime factor in the DDG-51 program may not be which company looks best to the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much it can spend on a new destroyer without looking like a spendthrift. // In testimony this month before the Senate Armed Services Committee , Adm . James D. Watkins , the Chief of Naval Operations , said the Navy was requesting funding in the next fiscal year for 23 new ships and six modernizations of existing ships . Besides the lead DDG-51 , new construction would include a Trident submarine at about $1. 8 billion , four attack submarines at about $680 million each , and three CG-47 cruisers at about $1. 1 billion each. // Reactivation of the battleship Missouri is also planned . Admiral Watkins called the DDG-51 " affordable in the numbers required. " // In the budget battle for DDG-51 , perhaps the last big Pentagon shipbuilding contract of the 20th century , Republican Senators William S. Cohen of Maine and Pete Wilson of California , both members of the Armed Services Committee , are expected to play important roles. //
