Sony 's wee Watchman makes viewing a moveable minifeast <P> Good evening , this is your anchorman , Harry Hairspray , with the Six O'clock News . Tonight 's top story : VIDEO GOES VEST POCKET . <P> " You are no doubt wondering why my voice seems so tinny and my head is smaller than a peanut . That is because you have tuned in on the new Sony Watchman , the slender , hand-held TV set no larger than a walkie-talkie . Even at $349.95 , Watchman was one of the hottest ( and hardest to find ) novelties in the stores this holiday season . Those mini-masters at Sony who shrank stereo music three years ago into the oft-imitated Walkman have scored again with this 19-oz. marvel and its 2-in. screen . <P> " The company has shipped all 10,000 of the Watchmans imported so far , and American distributors despair of getting enough to fill their back orders . Reason : the Japanese are buying the Lilliputian sets in such quantities ( more than 5,000 per month ) that the U.S. market remains on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales it can get . Profits for its most recently reported quarter fell sharply . Watchman is bound to help . ' Every piece we get we could sell 20 times , ' says Sony 's Miami-based Southeast regional manager , Barry Mitchell . In Dallas , Neiman-Marcus Merchandise Manager Robert Ackerman describes the Watchman as ' a sellout in every one of our 18 stores . ' <P> " Even though I look very small , you will have noticed by now that my black-and-white image is sharp and clear whether you are using batteries or the plug-in adapter provided with the set . A number of small-screen TVs are now on the market , but none can match Watchman 's remarkable compactness . The ? %-in. - thick picture tube achieves its thinness through a significant technological twist . Instead of beaming electrons from some distance behind the tube face , as do conventional sets , Watchman 's emitting gun rests alongside the tube and shoots the electrons across it . The picture is then pulled into view by powerful minimagnets . <P> " Sony plans to adapt this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV set the size and thinness of a painting hanging on the living-room wall may soon be a reality . In fact , the West German firm of Siemens AG , using a different technology , has built a prototype 14-in. screen just 2.3 in. thick . The prototype will have a more immediate application as a computer accessory than as a home TV screen . But one slender advantage is already possible : the Siemens screen can be folded up for storage or transport . <P> " Meanwhile , Sony expects the Watchman to alter , or at least extend , any number of viewing habits . People can gaze at the gadget on the beach , carry it into stadium stands to catch instant replays , use it for soap-opera breaks while at school or work , or take it along on car trips . Predicts Warren Zorek , the manager of the consumer electronics department at Bloomingdale 's in Manhattan : A color version should be on the way before too long , and it is n't farfetched to foresee hand-held video-game attachments and personal computer compatibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
