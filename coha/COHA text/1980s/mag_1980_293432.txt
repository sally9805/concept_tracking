After a long trial , the jury lets Bert Lance go <P> The trial was as meandering as the Suwannee River . For 16 weeks , lawyers argued their cases before Atlanta Judge Charles A. Moye Jr. - with the help of courtroom bombast , some 20,000 documents and 173 witnesses , including testimonials from luminaries like Lillian Carter . Finally , after mulling over the evidence for eight days , the jurors last week reached a verdict . They found former Budget Director Bert Lance not guilty on nine counts of bank fraud , but deadlocked on three other counts of banking violations . As the jurors filed out of the courtroom , several of them waved at Lance and his wife LaBelle . Beamed Lance afterward : " We just plain licked ' em . " The next day he reported that his close friend Jimmy Carter had congratulated him in almost the same words he used in 1977 , only weeks before Lance resigned from the Administration . Carter 's message last week : " Bert , I 'm still proud of you . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 counts of conspiracy , false financial statements and misapplication of bank funds from 1970 to 1978 . During much of that time he had served as president of either the Calhoun ( Ga . ) First National Bank or of Atlanta 's National Bank of Georgia . After the prosecution finished its case three weeks ago , Judge Moye dismissed the conspiracy charge and 13 other counts because of insufficient evidence . The remaining charges accused Lance of misusing bank funds in making improperly secured loans totaling about $1 million to his wife , son and friends and of submitting false financial statements to influence loans . At the heart of the case was Lancelot , a partnership that Lance and his wife established in 1973 , ostensibly to make charitable contributions . But the prosecution claimed that in 1974 , Lance buried personal debts of $710,000 in Lancelot so that he would appear more wealthy when applying for loans . <P> Lance denied the charges , as well as any intention of hurting the banks . In an emotional summation that left some jurors weeping , Defense Attorney Nickolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't understand how we trust folks down here . If you find Mr. Lance guilty of anything , you will have ruined the reputation , life and character of one of the South 's finest men . " <P> The jury apparently agreed . Said Juror William Savage , 37 , a carpenter : " We knew the financial statements were wrong , but there was n't enough evidence to show that he had actually intended to make false statements . " Anthony Tigner , 25 , a railroad porter , admitted that the jury was leaning toward conviction on at least one charge , but added , " Certain people felt the defendants were not guilty , regardless of the evidence . "
