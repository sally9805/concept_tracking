When the Summer Olympics were held in Los Angeles 52 years ago , TIME 'S pre-Games coverage amounted to one column of miscellaneous notes and statistics . ( Sample : the 69-member Brazilian team was so strapped for funds it had to sell bags of coffee to finance its stay . ) We have come a long way since 1932 . This week TIME marks the return of the Summer Games to the U.S. with one of the biggest editorial issues in its history . In addition to 15 pages of convention coverage , the magazine contains a 38-page Special Section , by far TIME 'S largest Olympic undertaking . Under the direction of Assistant Managing Editor Walter Bingham and Senior Editor Jose M. Ferrer III , Special Projects Art Director Tom Bentkowski , along with dozens of writers , photographers , correspondents and reporter-researchers , put together a preview of the quadrennial event that offers not only a sense of its vastness but , in Ferrer 's words , " creates a sense of focus . Our stories introduce a relatively small number of U.S. and foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide to the myriad individuals and statistics involved in the Games . " <P> Among those individuals are 18 athletes from nine countries ( Britain , China , Egypt , Greece , India , Italy , Japan , Kenya and the U.S. ) whom TIME has photographed against one of their homeland 's famous symbols or landmarks . This 14-page photo essay , with captions by Senior Writer Paul Gray , provides dazzling evidence of the artful eye of Photographer Neil Leifer , who also took the cover picture of U.S. Track and Field Star Carl Lewis at the Statue of Liberty . " Not only was this the best assignment I 've ever had , " says Leifer , " it was the best I 've ever heard about . " It was certainly one of the longest : 18 months from first proposal to final prints , involving substantial amounts of planning , travel and especially diplomacy . " Persuading star athletes to interrupt their training schedules and sometimes go hundreds of miles to pose for pictures took a lot of cajolery , " recalls Leifer . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early so we could shoot in late-afternoon light and convincing the Chinese that I indeed wanted to shoot at the Great Wall and not at the Temple of Heaven , even though the temple was in Peking and the Wall a 2-hour drive away . " Leifer was aided in his planning by Deputy Picture Editor Michele Stephenson and Staff Assistant Antonio Suarez , who helped with the entire assignment . <P> No one , however , was able to foresee some of the difficulties Leifer was to encounter . In England he found his first choice for a backdrop , Big Ben , sheathed in scaffolding . Result : the shoot underwent a fast change of locale to Windsor Castle . Scaffolding also loomed as a potential problem at the Statue of Liberty , which was scheduled to be shut down late last year for repair and refurbishing . Leifer quickly corralled the busy Carl Lewis and got him to pose last October in what was then the only prototype of the U.S. Olympic uniform . " The real difficulty , " says Leifer , " was getting him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light is best . Carl hates to get up early . "
