By Jonathan Rotenbert A personal computer could be one of the most wonderful , most useful , most enthralling things to enter your life . It could also be one of the most perplexing , time consuming experiences you ' ve ever had . The problem for most consumers is not so much using personal computers - using a computer is not nearly hard as you may think . The problem is getting started . There ' s a lot of hype for personal computers , each one claiming to be better than the rest . It ' s not clear how to evaluate these advertising claims . You ' re probably not exactly sure what a computer could do for you , and probably wouldn ' t know what features to look for or compare . The salesman all seem very helpful , but you ' re just not sure what questions to ask them . Honest , it ' s not as complicated as it all seems . Personal computers have become appliances - like your toaster or hi-fi - designed to perform a useful function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer scientist to use a personal computer . Here are some of the basic questions you may have been wondering about , with some straight answers . Once you get over the initial confusion , you ' ll find that personal computers are really pretty easy to understand . What do personal computers do ? The most common applications for personal computers fall into three categories : home , business and school . They are used in the home for entertainment ( computer games ) , education ( teaching programs that supplement elementary education , especially in mathematics and language ) , personal finance ( tax planning , stock analysis , checkbook reconciliation ) and learning computer programming . Businesses use personal computers for filing , general ledger , payroll , forecasting and word processing . In schools , the personal computer is used primarily in conjunction with computer literacy programs . An exciting new application for personal computers is called telecomputing . The way telecomputing works is that you purchase a $200-$400 device for your computer , called a modem . The modem lets you connect your computer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of a local phone call and a $2- $15 hourly usage fee . These services include : up-to-the-minute stock and commodities quotes , news services , airline reservations , restaurant reviews , theater reservations , electronic banking , electronic shopping , encyclopedias , personal computer programs and electronic mail . It is important to remember that a computer by itself is useless , unless programmed to do something . The programs , or software , for personal computers are sold like records are sold for stereos . What is the difference between a personal computer , a calculator , a video game and a mini computer ? There is e gray area between the personal computer and these other kinds of equipment . A calculator works only with numbers , while a computer can process numbers and words . A computer can be programmed and can be expanded with additional memory and accessories , while most calculators can not . There are also calculators that look like computers , and computers that look like calculators , but don ' t let this confuse you . A video game fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal computer . However , video games are restricted to playing games and performing simple computer functions . Personal computers can be programmed to work like video games , but have far greater potential to be used in practical applications . Personal computers are also more costly . Mini computers are the predecessors to personal computers . The personal computer has a " brain " similar in design to the one in these refrigerator sized systems , but is miniaturized onto a tiny slice of silicon . The personal computer is thus substantially less expensive . The mini computer is practical in larger business applications , where very high speeds and large memory capacities are critical . How much do personal computers cost ? For home and school applications , about $200-$2500 ; for most business applications , about $2000-$9000 . For $200 , you can get a minimal system which plugs into your TV set for display and into a cassette recorder for storage . Such a system would be very limited in terms of practical applications , but might be ideal if you wanted to get started without making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the $400-$1200 range . Some come with a TV display built in , others require the use of your television set . Some offer full color displays , while others are black-and-white . All use standard cassette tapes for storing programs and information , which is impractical for business applications , but acceptable for most other applications . Using a cassette tape , it can take the computer 30 seconds to 3 minutes to read in a program . The next level up for home and school run in the $1200-$2500 range . These computers use floppy disks for program and information storage . A floppy disk looks like a miniature phonograph record . A computer equipped with a floppy disk reader can read in programs in just seconds . For more complicated applications , especially applications involving extensive financial data or computer graphics , a computer in this range will be necessary . Take note , however , that most personal computers can be purchased in a minimal configuration for a few hundred dollars . They can be expanded as your needs grow , with plug in accessories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for business use . The majority can be used for both . Business configurations tend to be more expensive than home versions because the business person usually requires a printer ( a unit that prints information on paper ) and a greater memory capacity . Business computers are often sold as complete packages , with programs and repair service , which further adds to their cost . What about the software ? Software , or the programs , for home and school computers runs $5- $100 per package , averaging about $15- $20 ; business software runs in the $50-$500 range , depending on the complexity of the package . Should I buy now , or wait for better , cheaper equipment to be introduced ? It depends . If you feel that you have an application now , you should definitely shop around and decide if you can justify the cost . Chances are , there will eventually be something better ( though probably not much less expensive ) , but you don ' t know whether it will come out in six months or five years . Never count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer industry is notorious for incredible products that never make it to market . If you don ' t feel that you can justify the investment now , you ' re probably better off waiting . You may want to consider whether the computer could be used to save money or time for you , as this savings could pay for the computer several times over . Don ' t feel too paranoic about being stuck with obsolete equipment . It is unlikely that there will be any developments in the next few years so revolutionary as to really obsolete current personal computers . If I do buy now , what should I look for ? You want to select a system which will meet as many of your needs as possible for the best price . Some of the needs you will have , but may not realize now , are : dealer support ( will the dealer be able to help you when you have problems or when you want to expand your computer ) ; software support ( this means : are programs available for the applications you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and can you afford them ) ; ease of use ( do you feel comfortable using the computer ) ; expandability ( as your needs grow , how easy will it be for the computer to provide a reasonable turn around time on repairs ) ; and warranty ( what is and isn ' t covered in the warranty , and for how long ) . The most important suggestion I can offer is shop around . As you look at the different systems , you ' ll begin to develop a clear idea of what a personal computer can and can ' t do for you . Be sure to insist that every sales person sits you down and shows you how to use each computer . The ' test drive ' is very important . And , by all means , go to the Northeast Computer Show . You can see and try out as much equipment in one day at shows like this as you can driving around to different computer dealers in a month .
