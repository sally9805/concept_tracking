in 1966 , the communist leaders of Rumania were surveying their country 's birthrates with mounting despair . For nine straight years , the fertility of Rumanian women had plunged until it was well below the replacement level . The cause , the government concluded , was a state decree in 1957 that had legalized abortion and made it readily available on request . With a fee of less than $2 and only slight danger , abortion had become for Rumanian women a procedure as routine as having a tooth filled . Consequently , they had given up most other methods of contraception and depended almost entirely on abortion as their leading method of birth control . By 1965 , four out of every five conceptions were ended in abortion . What could be done ? One way out of their quandary , the nation 's leaders concluded , would be to make abortion more difficult . But instead of consulting demographers about the possible consequences , the Rumanian government took immediate action . In State Decree Number 770 on November 1 , 1966 , the government severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pronatalist measures , such as birth premiums and reduced taxes for couples with children . Nine months later , Rumania 's reluctant mother heroines , as they 've been called , responded in an extraordinary burst of proletarian fervor . In September 1967 , the number of births tripled over the previous December . For the year of 1967 , both the crude birthrate and the number of births were twice that of 1966 . Newspapers reported instances of three new mothers sharing a single hospital bed . Doctors urged women to stay at home to have their babies to save space . There was even a shortage of nurses , since most of them were pregnant , too . The Rumanian government had succeeded far beyond its wildest hopes . It had unleashed what is believed to be the sharpest increase in the fertility of a large population in the history of the human species . Immediately after 1967 , Rumanian fertility rates dropped by 50 percent as women began to find other means of contraception . ( A further reason for the drop is that , in contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country became pregnant at the sound of the government 's whistle , now most had just given birth and were removed from the running for at least a few months . ) But over the next decade , Rumania doubled its rate of population increase and produced an estimated 39 percent more babies than might otherwise have been expected ( compared to an " excess " of 34 percent during America 's baby boom ) . The Rumanian baby boomlet , which on a graph looks less like a pig in a python than a giraffe in a python , is also producing predictable dislocations as it pushes through the age cycle . In 1972 , Rumania abruptly had twice as many children in kindergarten as the year earlier . In the late 1980s , it will have twice as many people entering the labor force and marrying ( and thereby producing an " echo " boom of their own ) . Around the year 2040 , Rumania can expect even a tomb boom . An extreme case ? Perhaps , but the pressures to promote fertility are growing every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britain , Luxembourg and East and West Germany  --  have more annual deaths than births . Many others  --  including Belgium , Denmark , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Norway and Sweden  --  are facing imminent population decline . None of these countries is taking it lightly . The prime minister of Luxembourg has complained of a " suicidal attitude " among his citizens . And as early as 1976 , France 's President Valery Giscard d'Estaing warned that no country with a middle-sized population could realistically aspire to grandeur . ( At the time of Napoleon , France was one-fifth of Europe 's population ; it is now one-20th . ) The West Germans were running a TV show with titles such as " Are the Germans Dying Out ? " and in Australia , where the boom had been strongest , words like " madness " were used to describe the drop in fertility . One demographer , Charles Westoff , believes that European fertility could drop as low as 1.5 children per mother ( the lowest rate ever recorded was 1.8 for those born in 1907 in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year 2000 is not whether we shall have to reward women to have children but how much the reward will have to be . The question America 's baby-boom mothers are posing for the future is whether or not their lowered fertility will prevail . At a time when women are having only half as many children as their mothers , the family is increasingly being described as " obsolete " or " extinct . " The place of women in the family has certainly changed : They marry later , go to work before having their first child and return to work after having their children . So many of them have left the home , whether through working or divorce , that the traditional American family is more likely to be found in the pages of The Saturday Evening Post than on Main Street . Today , the old-style nuclear family of a breadwinner husband , housewife mother and one child is only 16 percent of all households . Add another child and the percentage falls to less than 10 percent . Most Americans spend some part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the questions remain : Has the baby boom pulled the pins from underneath the family ? Has it lost the will to reproduce itself ? Or is what we are seeing a healthy adaptation to change ? Will future generations , like salmon thrashing upriver to spawn , continue to obey the primordial impulse to procreate ? Demographers , still feeling the embarrassments of the baby boom and the baby bust , are understandably cautious . Few of them think , for example , that the current total birthrate of around 1.8 children per mother could hold up . . . but it might . The problem is that there are too many unknowns . Half the births of 1980 were to women who were not yet married in 1975 . In the next five years , 10 million women now aged 15-19 , about whose fertility habits little is known , will enter their prime reproductive years . All our assumptions about fertility could be changed by what they do . Or even by technological change . Back in 1900 , people thought New York City could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stall all the horses . A significant victory by the Right to Life organization , for example , could have a similar impact on fertility ( but presumably not as severe ) as Rumania 's State Decree Number 770 . The previous low fertility mark for a group of American women was set by the 1906-10 group . There is , unfortunately , a problem with projecting future births . It is that no one can say for certain whether women are merely delaying births or not having them at all . The 1946-50 group , for example , is at least biologically capable of producing babies until the year 2000 , when its youngest members turn 50 . That leaves plenty of years for these women to change their minds about having children or to make up for lost time . The 1946-50 women might well follow the pattern of their mothers born in 1910.25 , whose childbearing was curtailed in their younger years by the Depression , but who caught up with a vengeance immediately after World War II . Demographers have asked women how many children they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The baby boomers plainly expect fewer . Between 1967 ( the first year the Census Bureau collected such data ) and 1978 , the average number of births expected by 18- to 34-year-old wives dropped from 3.1 to 2.3 . The decline was most drastic among white college graduates , who in 1978 expected to have only L9 children apiece . Yet , even these guesses may be high . Women contemplating children do not anticipate the interruption of a divorce , for example , or difficulty in conception . One government demographer , Arthur Campbell , has shown that if women now really have as many babies as they say they will , their fertility would have to rise by as much as 20 percent in their later years . And as they grow older , women are often forced to reduce their expectations . When they were teen-agers in 1967 , baby-boom women born in the late 1940s said they expected to have 2.719 babies apiece . Just five years later , in 1972 , these same women scaled back their expected families to 2.282 children each . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices of the present , not the future . Perhaps the biggest mystery in the minds of baby-boom women is the question of how many ever will have children . Fully 15 percent of the boom ' s college-educated women say they expect to remain childless  --  and seem to mean it . In recent years , the proportion of childless women in their 20s has doubled ( to 41 percent for those 20-24 ) and now 18 percent of all women born in the peak baby-boom years of 1954-60 say they never expect to have children . Ultimately , their childbearing may come to resemble not their mothers but their grandmothers in 1908 who achieved the all-time record low fertility largely because 22 percent of them had no children at all . As for those women who say they will have children , the time is fast approaching for them to fish or cut bait . However improbable , no fewer than 22 percent of all childless women 30-35 claim that they will eventually have two babies . So far , these women have been able to reconcile their acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by telling themselves that they will catch up later . But time must eventually force a reckoning . In 1981 , a half-million more wornen will cross 35 ? often seen as the last chance for childbearing  --  than in the previous year . By the end of the decade , 18 million women will face the Catch-35 dilemma . There is already anguished pillow talk in baby-boom households as the decision is faced . Will a child hurt my career ? What will our parents think ? For some women , this will be the time of Torschlusspanik ( literally , " closing-time panic " ) in which they see their last chance to fulfill their fantasies about motherhood and femininity . Some will grab for it all  --  husband , baby and career  --  and try to bear up under the inevitable strains . Other women will perhaps reluctantly recognize that , for them , fertility delayed was fertility denied . Later was never . No one should under-estimate the pull of parenthood . Betty Rollin. who had opened the ' 70s with her assault on mandatory motherhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels like I 've missed something . " According to novelist Anne Roiphe , " There 's a difference between what one says at 20 and what one says at 38 . We 're seeing a whole rash of people having babies just in the nick of time . " And here is Paula Cizmar , a baby-boom feminist , wrestling with her decision in a magazine article : " On my next birthday I will be 30 and I do n't want to be a casualty of the war between my politics and my biological clock . " Cizmar questions her motives : " Why do I want to have a baby ? Am I simply afraid miss something if I do n't ? " And , like the baby boomer she is , she worries that she will somehow fail to live up to her own high expectations : " Combining motherhood with work presents me with a horrible possibility  --  two opportunities to succeed or fail . And suppose I fail at both ?

' ' " I 'm afraid that Mrs. Pumpelly will not be able to accommodate you , " returned the butler stiffly . " That 's all right . We kin park on the lawn . " " That is out of the question ! " replied Grafton sternly . It was gradually dawning upon Uncle Ezra 's limited intelligence that , possibly for some reason unknown to him , he was not wanted . The Hoskinses were a stubborn breed and Ezra was a Hoskins . " Look here , mister ! We 're guests ez much ez anybody ! It 's mighty queer if a feller ca n't park his car in front of his own niece 's house . " " Mrs. Pumpelly can not have her friends inconvenienced ! " Grafton announced . " If you do n't move , I 'll send for the police ! " " Send fer ' em , if you want to ! " shouted Ezra , now thoroughly angry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' you kin tell Edna I 'm ashamed of her fer treat-in ' her own uncle this way . It 's most supper-time , " he added plaintively . " We 're goin ' to put up right here . " Edna , observing the impasse from her window , decided to take a hand herself . Shrouding her elephantine figure in a pink wrapper , she hurried downstairs and came waddling across the lawn . Now , although none of the Pottsvillians had been invited to the party , it would have been contrary to the laws of human nature for them not to have treated the Pumpelly blow-out just as they would any other free show . Practically the entire populace was now congregated along the edge of the lawn . Ezra , perceiving that the public was with him , gained courage . " You jackanapes ! " he taunted the majestic manservant . " Fer two cents I 'll swat y ' in the kisser ! " " Go it , Popeye ! Y ' c'n lick him ! " incited the crowd . The empurpled Grafton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding herself together the best she could , arrived to insist upon his carrying out her orders . Uncle Ezra , in all innocence , assuming that she had come to welcome him , hastened to her . " It 's me , Edna ! It 's your Uncle Ezra ! " he informed her . " I writ ye we was comin ' .. Here , children ! Go see your Aunt Edna ! " Ceasing their acrobatics , the four gamins made a dash for her . " Auntie Edna ! Auntie Edna ! " they shrilled . For an instant she hung on dead center . Should she admit the relationship before this jeering multitude and thereby lose caste forever in Pottsville , or should she face it out ? ( To be concluded in the March issue . ) Dilemma continued from page 118 riving . We can see this in the age-specific birthrate for older women . In 1970 , the birthrate for women 30-34 having their first child was 7.3 per thousand . In 1977 , as the first baby boomers entered the 30-34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well-known women like Erica Jong and Paula Prentiss and Nora Ephron were issuing their first children in their mid-30s . I have been talking of the baby-boomers as if they were solely responsible for the baby bust . So far , they have been . But future fertility deals with the next generation . Will it be the same or different ? To put it another way , has the baby boom introduced new ideas and habits of family and fertility that the succeeding generation will inherit and carry forward ? Or are the changes carried by the baby-boom generation exclusive to it ? Will a new , smaller generation act differently and reverse all the changes the boom babies brought to the family in the ' 70s and ' 80s ? This takes us back to the " relative income " hypothesis of Richard Easter-lin . Once again , Easterlin sees a self-generating mechanism in which fertili-ty operates like a metronome , rocking back and forth from boom to bust to boom again . Large numbers of women born during the boom will be relatively disadvan-taged and produce few fe-males @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce large num-bers . The fate of these groups is therefore inex-tricably bound to its size . Even the former " marriage squeeze " will reverse . In the mid-1980s , the smaller group of women born after the baby boom will be able to look for marriage partners among the last , large group of baby-boom men . These men of " bachelor bulge , " in turn , will face a shortage of available younger women and may turn to older baby-boom women as a suitable new supply of potential mates . ( The bachelor boom has already begun in Britain , where there are five percent more Englishmen at 20-24 than younger women . ) Easterlin is convinced that this generation will perceive its improved affluence and raise its fertility over the next two decades . Other demographers , most notably Charles Continued on page 128 Dilemma continued from page 120 Westoff of Princeton , take the opposite view : Namely , that the social and economic trends which contribute to low fertility are here to stay . The movement from traditional , agrarian society to modern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline in fertility . As children have been transformed from an economic asset to a liability and as infant mortality has declined , the rationale for having more children has accordingly diminished . Westoff also argues that the Easterlin hypothesis ignores the sweeping changes in women 's status and expectations . These include : The Devaluation of Marriage . Due in part to the baby boomers , marriage is no longer defined as the only legitimate status for a woman . Married couples with children as a percentage of all U.S. households dropped from 44 percent in 1960 to 32 percent in 1979 . If countries like Sweden and Denmark are reliable lead indicators , the attrition will continue . Marriages declined in Sweden by 30 percent between 1966 and 1975 . In Denmark , the proportion of unmarried 20- to 24-year-olds rose to more than 60 percent in 1975 . According to an annual poll of American college freshmen , the percentage who feel that raising a family is an important goal in life fell from 71 percent in 1969 to 57 percent in 1979 . Cohabitation . The doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than a decade means that most of one million women have been effectively removed from childbearing . Many of them are experimenting with " trial marriages " and will someday marry and have children . But cohabitation delays it . And , as Westoff has pointed out , cohabitation is increasingly regarded as a permanent life style . In Denmark , one-quarter of all women 18-25 live with a man to whom they are not married . And one out of every four of them rejects the idea of ever marrying . Divorce . The men and women of the baby boom have all but killed off the traditional marital idea of one partner forever . It is hard to imagine that any future generation will be able to revive it . One Wall Street firm has estimatedthat by 1985 there will be more divorces in the United States than first marriages . Working Women . Of all the changes brought to women 's lives , this clearly would be the hardest to roll back . Current estimates are that two out of three women in their prime childbearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages continue to rise , that fact alone will continue to change the economics of childbearing . Babies will not be worth the cost of forfeited salaries . Only a massive increase in day care , they say , could weaken the link between market wages and the price of children and thereby allow increased fertility . Easterlin 's answer to the problem posed by changed women 's career and family values is essentially that they focus attention on the wrong thing . He maintains that the Procreation Ethic of the 1950s has not been rejected but rationalized out of sight by baby-boom women who have been forced into the job market by their husbands ' deteriorating economic situation . They could easily embrace the Procreation Ethic again  --  as they did in the ' 40s and ' 50s . Westoff 's reply is that women 's roles have changed so radically since the mid- ' 40s that they can not be compared . Easterlin , for example , holds that , as young men 's opportunities improve in the 1980s and 1990s , women will marry them quicker and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Westoff counters that such an argument is sexist at heart : " Why enlarged economic opportunity will not be exploited by women as well as by men is not explained . The notion that women are all anxious toquit their jobs and return to the kitchen and nursery as soon as economic conditions permit misses what I believe are quite permanent changes among increasing proportions of young women in their perceptions of what life is all about in the late 20th century . " Westoff then goes on to an interesting speculation . As independent as women have become , what if the present trends were to lead to full economic equality ? There would be just as many female bankers as male bankers . Both sexes would receive the same wages . What , then , would be the consequences for marriage and fertility ? The institution of marriage , he says , would lose one of its few remaining sociological rationales . If traditional marriage were described in strictly contractual terms , it might sound like this : Women offer their sexual , companionate and maternal services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's income . Westoff admits this is " hardly a romantic view of the relationship " but one that does help explain why the institution has lasted . Under a full-equality system , however , women would be economically independent of marriage . They would be free to enter into any relationships on other grounds . But what motivation would they have ? Sexual and emotional companionship are increasingly available outside of marriage , as witness the popularity of cohabitation . Childbearing is the other prime function of marriage . But that , as we have seen , is in full retreat . Childlessness both inside and outside of marriage is increasing . His conclusion is inevitable . Women will not make the choice to return to the Procreation Ethic . In fact , good times will only cement them more firmly into the work force and result in further atrophy of marriage and the family . The downward trend in fertility will continue into the next century until the American population reaches a peak of about 253 million in the year 2015 , when it will begin to decline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain why women who are economically free to give up the maternal way of life would ever want to return to it . Thus , as in the ' 30s , the survival of the species is once again under discussion ; the debate has come full circle .
