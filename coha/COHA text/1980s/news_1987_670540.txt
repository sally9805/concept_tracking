Mr. De Palma ' s films are well known for their perverse streak , to put it no more strongly than that . His screenwriter , David Mamet , takes a notoriously disenchanted view of the American scene . Given the two men ' s reputations , there was an unusual amount of curiosity before the movie opened about how they would handle their venerable material . Prohibition Chicago , yes ; but a bang-bang television program that had had Walter Winchell as its resident moralist ? Surely Mr. De Palma and Mr. Mamet weren ' t going to be wholly in earnest. // In the event , the most unexpected thing about the movie , it has been generally agreed , is how straight they have decided to play it . There are local twists and limited turns ( and there is no Walter Winchell ) ; but critics who came hoping to see an ironical reworking of the old G-man legend have been sent away disappointed. // True , Kevin Costner , in an engaging portrayal , makes Eliot Ness more human and less of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the same intrepid crusader . If he learns how to bend the rules in the course of his crusade , we feel that he is still inwardly incorruptible , and if he eventually dispatches a hardened killer when he doesn ' t absolutely have to , it is only after being subjected to maximum provocation. // He has also been fitted out with a wholesome young family , and at one point he teases his adoring wife about calling their new son " John Edgar . " But we can be sure that it is the most playful of jokes . John Edgar Hoover is still in his heaven. // Not , of course , that the film is anywhere near as unsophisticated as this may make it sound . Mr. De Palma ' s direction is bold and ingenious , and he contrives some electrifying little touches. // Capone at the opera , for example , watching " I Pagliacci " while two of his henchmen are carrying out a killing for him in another part of town . After the performance , champagne is brought on ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sparing and carefully judged ) ; one of the singers , still wearing his makeup and his clown ' s costume , raises his glass with a plump smile that suddenly makes him seem like an effete double of the overweight Capone , who is an untiring performer himself , and who knows how to clown , too. // It is imaginative moments like these that make " The Untouchables " disconcerting . How could anyone who had dreamed them up expect us to swallow the more simple-minded elements in the movie ? And some of those elements are very simple-minded indeed. // There are the scenes with the eager , toothy , bespectacled little accountant , for instance , who keeps insisting that the way to get Capone is on income-tax violations . No one will listen to him ; even Ness wears a patronizing smile . But he keeps plugging away ( won ' t anyone listen ? ) ; he also runs cheerfully amok with a shotgun when he realizes that the gangsters are actually killing people , and eventually comes to a gory end in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit expendable ) . // The effect of such scenes is to make us wonder whether anything in the film can be taken seriously . There are other scenes that ought , in principle , to make a direct assault on our feelings . A little girl has been blown up by a gangster ' s bomb , and her mother comes to see Ness when his morale is at its lowest , to assure him that she has faith in him . A poignant enough incident , you might suppose ; certainly there is no hint of caricature about the way it is presented . Yet invisible quotation marks hover round it , and most of the other outwardly straightforward scenes in the movie , lending an ironic distance. // For much of its length , in fact , " The Untouchables " seems to have been made in a spirit of pastiche , with mildly absurdist undertones . Other sequences , by contrast , are exercises in extravagance and self-indulgence . An ambush on the Canadian border turns into a scene from a Western ; a baby carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staircase during a shootout at a railroad terminus , and obliging commentators won ' t fail to recall the Odessa Steps sequence in " The Battleship Potemkin . " <> <> Lack of a Central Myth // Between mock seriousness and directoral trickiness , what remains ? A few episodes are genuinely exciting . Sean Connery invests Malone , the veteran patrolman whose help Ness enlists , with more authority than the part deserves . ( In conception Malone - the one good apple in the Police Department barrel - is just as much of a comic-strip character as the other members of Ness ' s team . ) There are suavely filmed sequences making the most of Chicago landmarks , grandiose interiors , rich period detail. // But none of this , while it keeps you watching , is enough to compensate for the lack of a commanding central myth . Much cruder gangster films have projected far more emotional power. // If there is a mythic dimension to the movie , it can only be the one provided by Robert De Niro in his portrayal of Capone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capone who cultivates his image and enjoys the limelight , a prima donna who has the press eating out of his hand and who delivers accomplished after-dinner speeches ( though he is liable to round off the evening with a display of psychopathic fury ) . // The gangster as great communicator - it is a novel interpretation , and as far as it goes an arresting one . But it doesn ' t sufficiently allow for the Napoleonic element in Capone ( the Capone of cinematic myth , that is , not the real man ) , and it doesn ' t permit him to dominate the action as ferociously as he does in most movie versions of the legend . Its strengths are primarily those of comedy. // There is nothing wrong with that in principle , and De Niro himself turns in a satisfyingly sardonic performance . But elsewhere the humor of the movie has a way of being not so much cruel as brutish . In one scene , Malone blows out the brains of a gangster whom he pretends to be interrogating , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ' t know is that first gangster is already dead . But the audience knows , and the laughter that greeted the incident on the evening I saw the movie was as ugly as the incident itself. // In the end , for all its virtuosity , " The Untouchables " has something hollow about it . You feel that it is a product of Hollywood ' s decadence , that it is playing cleverly and self-consciously with energies that it doesn ' t naturally possess. //
