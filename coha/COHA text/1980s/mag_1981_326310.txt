When Nancy Reagan first arrived at George Washington University Hospital , her husband deadpanned : <P> " Honey , I forgot to duck . " The President , a onetime radio sportscaster , borrowed that line from Prizefighter Jack Dempsey , who said it to his wife in 1926 after losing the world heavyweight championship to Gene Tunney . <P> The crack was the first in a barrage of good-humored quips that Reagan tossed off after the shooting . The remarks , made before he had learned that other victims had been critically injured , did much to reassure his family , his staff and the American public that he was still healthy enough to laugh . They were also the envy of at least one other comedian . Said Johnny Carson to his audience at Hollywood 's Academy Awards ceremony : " I was tempted to call him and ask if he had any more of those one-liners I could use . " <P> Examples of the President 's jests : <P> &gt; To surgeons , as he entered the operating room : " Please tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , upon coming out of anesthesia in the recovery room ( paraphrasing Comedian W.C. Fields ) : <P> " All in all , I 'd rather be in Philadelphia . " <P> &gt; In another note , recalling a Winston Churchill observation : " There 's no more exhilarating feeling than being shot at without result . " <P> - In a third note : " Send me to L.A. , where I can see the air I 'm breathing . " <P> &gt; In yet another note written while surrounded by medical staff : " If I had this much attention in Hollywood , I 'd have stayed there . " <P> - Complimented by a doctor for being a good patient : " I have to be . My father-in-law is a doctor . " <P> - To an attentive nurse : " Does Nancy know about us ? " <P> &gt; To a nurse who told him to " keep up the good work " of his recovery : <P> " You mean this may happen several more times ? " <P> - To Daughter Maureen : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> - Greeting White House aides the morning after surgery : " Hi , fellas . <P> I knew it would be too much to hope that we could skip a staff meeting . " <P> - When told by Aide Lyn Nofziger that the Government was running normally : " What makes you think I 'd be happy about that ? "
