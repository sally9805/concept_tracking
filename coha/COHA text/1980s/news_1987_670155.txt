While North Korean President Kim Il Sung was being hugged by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on a state visit to Beijing in May , other Koreans were in town  --  from South Korea . Some had come to compete in a badminton tournament , others to attend a conference on dams . The other Koreans got considerably less attention than Mr. Kim . The badminton match did make the sports news , but the conference went unpublicized . As the muted coverage shows , while Beijing and Seoul are developing ties , the Chinese want to do so with as little publicity as possible . Improved relations could mean easier access to South Korea ' s technological and managerial expertise ; China ' s dilemma is that it must move gingerly to avoid antagonizing the Communist regime in Pyongyang and losing the tug of war with Moscow for North Korea ' s affections . South Korea , on the other hand , would benefit from trade relations , and even more important , a diplomatic breakthrough with China would embarrass its archenemy to the north . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambassador to South Korea , the Beijing-Seoul relationship " is going places . It may take time , but it is coming . " Though their countries lack diplomatic relations , South Koreans and Chinese regularly visit each others ' countries for sports events and international meetings . South Koreans routinely visit relatives in China , and executives from Seoul also make frequent trips . Chinese officials , likewise , travel to South Korea . Trade is growing and becoming more open and direct , even though it still is largely conducted through intermediaries . Several Chinese trading companies are setting up shop in Seoul , and South Koreans are expanding operations in Hong Kong to serve the China trade . Still , the biggest stumbling block to stronger ties is North Korea , China ' s ally and  --  to hear the Chinese propaganda machine tell it  --  blood brother . While Seoul has nothing to lose and everything to gain from expanding the relationship , Beijing must be more cautious . Upsetting Pyongyang risks pushing Mr. Kim closer to the Soviet Union , North Korea ' s other major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to justify undercutting a communist ally to promote ties with the ally ' s capitalist foe . But China has some leeway . Beijing believes Mr. Kim can ' t ignore China and move entirely into the Soviet sphere . And South Korea has equipment , know-how and management skills that China desperately needs for its modernization . South Korea is a popular subject for research by Chinese looking at alternative development models . The country seems to offer a model that combines rapid growth , large foreign-exchange earnings through exports and strong political controls in the early years of development . One of the biggest changes in the past year is South Korea ' s increasing willingness to talk about relations with China  --  a hush-hush subject earlier in the decade . " It isn ' t a matter of if we ' re going to have closer relations with China , but when , " says Park Soo Gil , assistant foreign minister . " It could take five years , or it could take a decade . " A South Korean executive who visits China regularly puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Koreans . They envy us . And they would like to maintain a closer relationship  --  as much and as soon as possible . " For Seoul , anything that embarrasses archenemy North Korea is good , and improving ties with China does exactly that . South Korean companies , meanwhile , long for the day when China will become a major market for their manufactured goods and a supplier of raw materials . Some South Koreans emphasize patience in forming relations with China , which must maintain an outward show of unity with North Korea . Yet many Chinese , including some government officials , express contempt for Kim Il Sung and his personality cult . For them , Mr. Kim ' s brand of communism is all too reminiscent of Mao Tse-tung ' s personality cult during the Cultural Revolution . According to one Korean executive , the North Korean dictator once even wrote a letter to Mao ' s wife denouncing Mr. Deng , China ' s current leader , as a " running dog of the American imperialistic warmongers . " Ambassador Lilley says the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea is " the dubious benefit of its relations with Pyongyang . " But geopolitics have for years prevented faster progress in promoting relations between Beijing and Seoul . In the 1970s , then U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger suggested that Beijing and Moscow establish diplomatic relations with South Korea in return for Japanese and U.S. recognition of North Korea . Kim Il Sung , who has long opposed anything that institutionalizes two Korean nations , scotched the idea . More recently , China has pushed for an air route that would link the two Koreas to China and Japan . Currently , flights from Japan to China fly around the air space of both Koreas . Again , North Korea isn ' t interested . For years , the Chinese have urged the U.S. to curtail its hostility toward North Korea in order to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula . This year , the U.S. allowed its diplomats to talk to their North Korean counterparts at social occasions . In the long term , U.S. officials hope that developing ties between China and South Korea will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four powers with strong interests in the region  --  the U.S. , China , Japan and the Soviet Union . But everyone agrees that hope for real change will come only after the 75-year-old Mr. Kim leaves the scene . Meanwhile , trade between China and South Korea is by all accounts increasing . Trade through Hong Kong alone grew 7% to $646 million in 1986 , according to Hong Kong government figures . Officials at Hongkong &; Shanghai Banking Corp. , the chief financier of Chinese-South Korean trade , estimate that total trade between the two countries exceeded $1. 2 billion last year . But so far , the goal of selling in the Chinese market has been as elusive for South Korea as it has for others . Last year , as China restricted imports because of a foreign-exchange crunch , South Korean exports to China through Hong Kong fell 22% to $276 million . Chinese exports to South Korea soared 48% to $370 million . The 1988 Olympics in Seoul offer further hope for growth in ties between Seoul and Beijing . After coming to last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to attend the Olympics , despite North Korea ' s objections . " Those contacts may become some stimulant for future developments , " says Cho Choong Hoon , chairman of Korean Air.
