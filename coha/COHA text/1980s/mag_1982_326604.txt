" So proclaimed the large , white handbills attached last week to walls , bulletin boards and trees on the campus of Bir Zeit University in the Israeli-occupied West Bank . The message continued : ' " The Islamic trend should be permitted to spread , particularly in Palestine . The Communists and the troublemakers , the enemies of Islam , have made many attempts to disturb our active life at the university . " The spokesmen of the " Islamic trend " were identified at the bottom of the page as the Islamic-controlled student councils of Najah University in Nablus , Hebron College in Hebron and eight other student groups in the West Bank and Gaza . <P> In one of the more remarkable developments on the West Bank since the Israeli occupation began 14 years ago , student supporters of a Khomeini-type Islamic fundamentalism are challenging the hitherto undisputed dominance of the leftists within the intellectual leadership of Palestinian nationalism .

In a sparsely furnished off-campus room last week , several earnest students explained their new-found beliefs to TIME Jerusalem Bureau Chief David Aikman . Said Samir Namir , 21 , a Middle East studies and political science major : " We are trying to return to the origins of Islam . In the past 100 years , all of the non-Islamic solutions attempted in the Arab world have failed . " Added bearded Ziad Hamdan , 21 : " Islam is the only solution to the problem of Palestine .
