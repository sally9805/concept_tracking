Nearly every aspect of life in South Africa is a stark study in black and white . That was clearer than ever last week after a strong swing to the right in a whites-only national election . A jubilant State President P.W . Botha , whose party increased its seats in Parliament , went on national television after declaring victory and said , " The outside world must accept that the white electorate is here to stay and has a special duty in South Africa . " To Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu , one of the country 's best-known blacks , the election carried a very different lesson . Said the 1984 Nobel Peace laureate : " We have entered the darkest age in the history of our country . " <P> The ruling National Party , which has been in power since 1948 , won 52% of the popular vote and 123 of the 166 elected seats in the all-white House of Assembly . But the surprise winner was the far-right Conservative Party , a group of former Nationalists who broke away from the party five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concessions to the country 's 30 million nonwhites . It received 26% of the vote and increased its parliamentary strength from 17 to 22 seats . <P> While the right was getting stronger , parties advocating changes in apartheid , the country 's system of racial separation , were the big losers . The Progressive Federal Party won just 14% of the vote , and its seats in Parliament dropped from 25 to 19 . The P.F.P. was the official opposition party in the outgoing Parliament , but that role will now be assumed by the Conservatives . The New Republic Party , another liberal group , lost four of its five seats . Acknowledged Progressive Leader Colin Eglin : " I can not deny that the results pose a major setback for the P.F.P. and the concept of a reform alliance developing into an alternative government . There is no doubt that the election in its totality represents a lurch to the right . " <P> The three-month election campaign was marked by ferment and friction among the country 's 5 million whites . Afrikaners , the descendants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely cohesive group that generally opposed change . But in recent times a growing number of them have been discussing the need for fresh approaches to racial policies . Leaders of the powerful Dutch Reformed Church and professors from several universities have called for new thinking about old problems .
