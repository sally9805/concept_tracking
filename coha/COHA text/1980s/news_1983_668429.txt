OSSINING , N.Y . - The 53-hour standoff at Sing Sing ended early today when cheering inmates released the last of 17 hostages and locked themselves in their cells . A few hours later , the head of the state ' s correction system promised that conditions at the prison would change . " We ' ll make recreation schedules more reasonable , and rules concerning packages will change , " Correction Comr . Thomas Coughlin said as he prepared to tour Cell Block B , where the uprising began Saturday . The freed guards , half of whom had less than a year ' s experience , were taken to a hospital checkups and sleep . All were reported in good condition . Coughlin said after his inspection that inmates had drenched the cellblock with water from fire hoses and that a cursory search had turned up many homemade weapons . " The inmates just totally trashed the place in terms of junk , " he said . " They didn ' t do very much damage . " All the inmates remained locked in their cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days , with inmates being fed in their cells and being allowed out only to see visitors . The prison , once known as Sing Sing and now called the Ossining Correctional Facility , had 2134 inmates today , 20 under capacity , Coughlin said . Several police and prison inquiries are under way . Their chief goal is to identify which of the 618 inmates of Cell Block B took part in the insurrection . Coughlin estimated the number of participants at between 20 and 150 . He did not rule out prosecution of inmates . Coughlin said a few guards who had indentified with their captors were among the four released last night , four hours before the final 12 walked to freedom . Another of the 17 hostages had been released earlier yesterday . Coughlin said the demands of the inmates differed little from problems that concern inmates in any prison in New York State . " I didn ' t have any problem saying , when I saw their list , that they are right , " he said of the inmates ' requests .

At 12:28 a.m. today , the watch commander at the prison announced over the guards ' walkie-talkies that the last hostage had been freed . One by one , the hostages , some of them dazed and looking tired , walked out of the cellblock . Their fellow workers applaued . " Glad to be out , " a correction officer said when asked how he felt . Cheers were heard from the cellblock . " Hey , thanks a lot , " a prisoner yelled through bars to reporters 200 yards away . Another inmate told reporters that prison administrators deserved no credit for ending the crisis . " It ' s not the administration that did this , " he said . " It ' s us and you . " At 1:40 a.m. , special state officers retook the cellblock . Gov . Mario Cuomo had refused to deal with the inmates until the hostages were freed . He praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dozens , maybe hundreds of hard decisions were made and most were made without time for reflection , " he said at 1 a.m . The inmates seized 19 hostages about 7:30 p.m . Saturday and released one almost at once to take messages to prison administrators . They released a second hostage Sunday . The inmates repeatedly said they did not want " another Attica , " referring to the 1971 riot at the upstate New York prison where 43 prisoners and guards were killed , most of them by State Police gunfire . At Ossining , the inmates said the state agreed to 10 conditions to end the takeover , but said they were afraid that if the list were not publicized , officials would renege . The list included regular mail and package deliveries , recreational and other programs , regular rules for prisoners awaiting transfer and the presence of reporters when the hostages were freed . The prisoners said they also had been assured there would be no retaliation against any inmate .

A Corrections Department spokesman , Lou Ganim , said the uprising began spontaneously during a recreation period , when inmates move freely in the cellblock . One man among 200 began shouting complaints , Ganim said , and when two guards tried to calm him , more shouting erupted and some inmates began breaking furniture . The prisoners had no food , and complained of hunger during the standoff . The heat in the cellblock was turned off , and prisoners put black strips of plastic over broken windows to keep out the cold . Several hostages were allowed to speak to reporters . One , who identifiedhimself as Marcus Mendez , said : " Mr. Cuomo , I ' m begging you to get me out . Help us . Everybody ' s OK , nobody ' s hurt . Mr. Cuomo , you are my only hope .
