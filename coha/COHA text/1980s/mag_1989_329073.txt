Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rounded up the usual expressions of ambiguity last week to deny reports that he had been talking to the Palestine Liberation Organization . Asserting for the umpteenth time that he never had and never would , Shamir did admit that he has been holding " get-acquainted " talks with a Palestinian from the West Bank identified with the P.L.O . But , he insisted , " there 's absolutely no negotiation with the P.L.O. , direct or indirect . " <P> As politicians  --  especially Middle Eastern politicians  --  are wont to do , Shamir was fudging the facts . Jamil Tarifi , a West Bank lawyer associated with the P.L.O. , confirmed the talks and implied that he would report on the meeting to P.L.O . chairman Yasser Arafat . By meeting with Tarifi , insisted Labor Party official Yossi Beilin , Shamir made the P.L.O . leader implicitly part of the bargaining process . Said Beilin : " That there is negotiation with the P.L.O . is quite clear . " <P> In fact , such a dialogue is well under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. on terms for elections in the occupied territories . Last week the P.L.O . offered a new list of conditions for its participation . The various parties interpreted the list to serve their own political ends . Some , including members of Israel 's Labor Party , considered Arafat 's terms relatively moderate because he reportedly dropped a demand for the total - withdrawal of Israeli troops before elections take place . Others read the terms , such as the long-standing demand for an independent Palestinian state , as confirmation of Arafat 's insufficient flexibility . Arafat , true to his own ambiguous style , conveniently chose to highlight his more rigid points to the Arab world . <P> That kind of double-talk is , unfortunately , the common coin of the Middle East dialogue . As principal exponents of the opposing sides , Shamir and Arafat have more than occasionally been guilty of talking out of both sides of their mouth . Each has proved a master at sounding comparatively moderate to international listeners , but appealing to ancient strains of chauvinism when addressing their constituents .
