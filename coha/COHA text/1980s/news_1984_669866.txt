HAVANA , Cuba  --  The large , ornate Havana-Libre Hotel once symbolized the corrupt regime of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista . Today the Miami Beach-style hotel reflects economic stagnation under President Fidel Castro . In the prerevolutionary 1950s , when Havana attracted rich American pleasure-seekers , the hotel was a spiffy part of the Hilton chain . Today it ' s on the edge of physical ruin . The rooms reek of mildew and the hallway carpets rot under the guests ' feet . It ' s a testament to Cuba ' s starvation for capital . Signs of the country ' s hard-currency dearth are everywhere : in the factories , bereft of modern equipment and limping along on old machinery ; in the sad disrepair of Havana ' s buildings , many of them reflections of architectural beauty and bygone affluence ; in the old Chevies and Plymouths dating back to the 1940s and 1950s that chug along the streets . " The country is chronically short of convertible currency , " says Penelope Hartland-Thunberg , an economist at Georgetown University ' s Center for Strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Center for Cuban Studies in New York , adds : " The old cars are the most obvious sign . It ' s the same with the factories . The whole phone system is obsolete . You can hardly find a copying machine , and when you do it probably doesn ' t work because they can ' t get the spare parts they need . " According to a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency analysis , Cuba suffers from shortages of consumer goods and spare parts for transportation and industrial machinery . Food is rationed , and black markets flourish . The Cuban government is trying to turn this around . The communist regime wants more hard currency to finance needed imports and it is promoting tourism and clothing production to attract money from abroad . " They ' re making strong efforts in tourism , with some success , " says Mrs. Hartland-Thunberg . Cuba recently held a fashion show to publicize its new clothing designs . " It was an enormous success , " says Ms. Levinson . " All the big European houses were there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to redress the country ' s basic problems : dependence on  --  and economic domination by  --  the Soviet Union . Nearly all the country ' s sugar production  --  up to 80%  --  goes to Soviet-bloc nations for prices far above market levels . That ' s a nice subsidy for a stagnant economy , but the island gets paid largely in rubles or barter , leaving it without significant foreign exchange for trading with other nations . Due partly to a bad harvest this year , Havana has had to reschedule payments on part of the $3. 5 billion it owes Western banks and government . In addition , Cuba owes an estimated $9 billion to Eastern-bloc countries , primarily the Soviet Union . A portion of Moscow ' s $4. 5 billion in annual economic aid to Havana is through loans . Thus , even if Cuba does increase its sugar production , it will have to dedicate much of the additional output to repaying Soviet-bloc debts . " They ' re locked in , " says Mrs. Hartland-Thunberg , the economist . Cuba ' s aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . With the U.S. , Cuba ' s natural trading partner , out of the picture because of Washington ' s economic boycott against the island , Mr. Castro is looking to Canada , Japan and Western Europe . He is pushing " joint venture projects " to attract foreign investment in such industries as tires , machinery and pharmaceuticals . But Cuba ' s high tax on profits , unreliable labor force and lack of legal safeguards generally discourage corporate investment in the island ' s industry . Mr. Castro also is trying to lure tourists to his beaches . The tourism effort appears to be the more successful . New facilities  --  " fairly modest but fairly nice , " says Mrs. Hartland-Thunberg  --  are available at Varadero Beach and Cayo Largo . But Canada , Europe and Japan are a long way from Cuba , and thus far the effort hasn ' t had a major impact on the economy . Most of the tourists , says Mrs. Hartland-Thunberg , are from Eastern-bloc nations , and they don ' t help the island ' s foreign-exchange problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being restored , and the little Ambos Mundos Hotel where Ernest Hemingway once toiled at his typewriter , has been refurbished . These efforts are aesthetically pleasing , but it ' s questionable whether they can make a significant difference in Cuba ' s economic life as long as two broader problems remain . One is the U.S. economic boycott , which doesn ' t seem likely to end as long as Cuba continues its foreign-policy adventurism in Africa and Central America . The other is the economic rigidities , and lack of incentives , imposed by the island ' s socialist order . Ms. Levinson of the Center for Cuban Studies says the government is moving more toward a system of incentives , but they " aren ' t based on the accumulation of goods " For example , she says , unproductive workers may have greater difficulty in getting good housing , always in short supply in Havana . But rigidities in the pay system remain . For example , Cuba ' s minister of public health , Dr. Sergio del Valle , says a newly trained doctor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ' s $450 ; for a mature and experienced doctor , the pay is $600 . Economic distinctions between beginners and old-timers are minimal , and upward mobility based on merit is practically nonexistent . Absenteeism is a major problem .
