From those two initial watercolors in 1981 - ' ' W.D. Snodgrass , You Sentimental Fool ' ' and ' ' Silly Man , Come Out of the Storm ' ' - grew an exceptionally fertile , and largely unprecedented , artistic collaboration . The resulting series of paintings and poems , entitled ' ' Who Killed Cock Robin ? , ' ' proved to be some of the more significant work each artist has produced. // For Mr. McGraw , the paintings were among his first to become commercially successful . For Snodgrass , the poems are among the most lyrical he has written , and represent a fresh burst of creativity 25 years after his initial success. // // Although the two artists live at opposite ends of the country - Snodgrass in Delaware and McGraw in southern California - and have met infrequently , they continue to collaborate . The Cock Robin poems are included in Snodgrass ' s most recent anthology , ' ' Selected Poems , 1957-1987 . ' ' And next spring , the University of Delaware will issue the first volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin ? ' ' // Oklahoma-born McGraw still speaks with a native drawl reinforced by a California casualness . He wears a rakish bow tie , sneakers , and no socks , and talks in animated bursts . Snodgrass , who continues to teach at the University of Delaware , is a classic eminence grise . Tall and silver-haired , he sports a flowing , Karl Marx-ish beard and a sotto voce demeanor . Both men showed great humor and deference - and a slight tendency to disagree - during the following interview . The discussion took place with Hilary DeVries in Philadelphia , after a reading by Snodgrass of his poems , in ' ' The Death of Cock Robin ? , ' ' at the Giannetta Gallery. // This is the first time you two had ' ' performed ' ' together , isn ' t it ? // McGraw : I had not heard you read your works until last night. // Snodgrass : Oh , that can ' t be true ! // McGraw : I had only heard a tape . It was very interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be farther from the truth , other times you were right on target. // De ( Snodgrass ) , your poems have undergone a major stylistic and thematic change since collaborating with Del . What was it that first attracted you to his paintings , other than the fact that they were about your poems ? // Snodgrass : I hadn ' t written light things , in a way virtuoso things , since the beginning of my career . I had finished a big cycle of poems on the Nazis called ' ' The Fuehrer Bunker ' ' and I thought I would leave it and go on . . . . But it also has to do with Del ' s paintings and their quality of playfulness . Del , I think , wants to keep a quality of improvisation in his work all the time , a sort of tossed-offness . Usually , I might be working on a poem for 10 , 12 , 20 years , and most of it is very carefully planned and plotted ahead of time. // Del , what first attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had read De ' s work in college and responded to it . Later , when I was going through a divorce and I was looking around for someone I could identify with , I picked up ' ' Heart ' s Needle ' ' again , which is about him losing his child during a divorce , and that was it . I had read enough of his work so that I saw the two sides : I saw a darkness and a lighter side. // I had never seen De ' s work as dark as everyone said . I gave a talk about De and a man came up to me and said , ' ' How do you two get along ? He ' s so dark . ' ' And I said I ' d never seen him as dark . He ' s got a great sense of irony ; he will laugh at himself . He talks about darkness , but the only way he can look at it for a lifetime is with humor. // At the time , my whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to leave . . . and De was able to speak of these things with a certain amount of gentleness or humor or irony . That ' s the way I read the poems. // It ' s amazing ; people still don ' t understand the way I work . They see it as light . But I ' m not Peter Max ! I feel in my work that I deal with very serious issues . I just think that the way to approach them is through the back door . And that means being a little humorous in my approach to painting , to be childlike . You ' re not hitting the viewer with a 20-pound sledge , but with a little hammer. ' ' // Snodgrass : For you , childlike is always good . And it isn ' t so for me . But there is always humor present and a seriousness . . . . It ' s easy to get to wallowing in your own seriousness , and that ' s dangerous . For me , after having immersed myself in something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicking up my heels. // How does this stylistic similarity affect your individual artistic processes ? // McGraw : That ' s what so interesting about art : you have to work out from this situation that you ' ve lived through . And maybe you wouldn ' t pick the life that you ' ve lived . But if you ' re honest , you ' re forced to respond to it . Even though I do extract images from his writings , it has to be sifted through my own life experience. // The way I work with his poems is , I read through and find some thread that I ' m interested in and I circle certain words in different-colored pencils and then I go to the dictionary and the thesaurus and I take it as far as I can . I have to do that before I can come up with images . I did that with one poem of his , and the circled words became the title of the painting. // And how does the poet work ? // Snodgrass : Any way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes the same way twice . I just want to be fired off ; I ' m not picky about how . . . a chain of associations , whatever will do that , I ' ll take it and go with it . Very often Del and I misunderstand each other . And should . For example with your big triptych , ' ' Who Killed Cock Robin ? , ' ' I hadn ' t known what the title of the painting was and I had just looked at it and sort of free-associated and come up with something quite different from what the painting is really about. // And it ' s quite right for you to take whatever you can from my writing , whether it has much to do with what my writing is about or not . You know , your painting called ' ' The Locked House ' ' ? It has almost nothing to do with my poem , which is about who is responsible for the bust-up of a marriage. // McGraw : I saw that house as home , the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that house ( in my painting ) warm and glowing . The little windows are not dark ; they ' re illuminated . And I ' ve got that candy-coated thorn guarding it . That ' s what I thought you were doing in the poem . You felt bad that all these things were ( happening in your marriage ) , when actually the vandals ( a threatening image in the poem ) were ourselves. // Snodgrass : Yeah , sure . We should have known that the danger wasn ' t from the vandalism from outside but from our own vandalism. // Can you give an example of what the painter has learned from the poet ? // McGraw : De knocked me out with ' ' Storm Family ' s Anthem , ' ' which he wrote after seeing the chair that I had used in several paintings and hadn ' t known was the chair that my grandmother had rocked me in . We didn ' t have a rocking chair . We didn ' t have a lot of money , and my grandmother had rocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that was what I had been painting until he nailed it in the poem. // Snodgrass : Yes , that poem was in response to the chair . And Del sees things all the time in my work that I hadn ' t seen but which now I do see. // You ' ve been called a ' ' painter ' s heir to Whitman . ' ' And many of your images also come from a strong folk art tradition , don ' t they ? // McGraw : Oh , absolutely. // Snodgrass : I ' ve always seen Whitman as the competition . He ' s our greatest poet by far , and I ' ve got to beat him , that sort of thing. // McGraw : I began painting in that terrible period of minimalism . And I was painting striped paintings and I never knew when to end them . You ' re laughing , but it was true . For the paintings with De ' s work I write a sentence , a fragment actually ; I lay down the pencil image in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and if I think it ' s going to work I pin it up on the wall and I start another one . But while I was at Cranbrook Academy of Art , I saw a folk art exhibit , including a sculpture of a horse and a black man , and I thought , ' ' This is great . The artist has made this for one reason - he had to . ' ' I started collecting folk art in that era , which brings me to a point . When I visited De in upstate New York , I looked at his collection of records and things that interested him and he had these wonderful primitive carvings , painted in primary colors , and I would have bought them , no doubt about it . I said to De , ' ' Isn ' t it odd that we ' re alike ? ' ' And he said , ' ' Of course not ! ' ' // So your connection has as much to do with personality and taste as it does with purely artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we choose to surround ourselves , the art on his walls , the music that he picks . For example , I spent money on my daughter ' s piano lessons and I really wanted her to play the harpsichord . And De ' s wife , Kathy , plays the harpsichord wonderfully . He loves the recorder ; I would love to have the time to play . So we have a whole base that ' s similar. // Snodgrass : It also has to with the fact that we ' re both basically middle-class , monogamous men who sometimes get into periods when we don ' t seem that way at all . But the important thing is . . . He doesn ' t try and control how I respond to his painting , and I don ' t control his response to my poems . I ' m just glad to have him respond . I ' m not the authority on my poems , anyway. // McGraw : This is what is great about this man ; this dribbly 35-year-old painter comes to him responding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oh , come on ! // McGraw : No , he ' s the man who buys so much of my work and has allowed me in four years to travel so far . And I ' d be interested in this , you ' ve had other artists who wanted to work with you. // Snodgrass : Yeah , but they didn ' t have the kind of attitude you do . With you I can go my way . I ' m free to misunderstand you and you are free to misunderstand me. // What do the specific constraints of your individual art forms have to do with the success of this collaboration ? In other words , why a dialogue between a poet and a painter instead of the other disciplines ? // Snodgrass : I think there is a good reason . A poem is so compressed , with so many different images in there , that it can take you in all sorts of directions other than the direction that it may take a regular reader. // McGraw : I have to read and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a novel or a play . They aren ' t explosive at all . And what I tend to want to do , which isn ' t right , is illustrate . When I read a poem , I have no desire to illustrate it. // Snodgrass : A poem can send you off in odd angles from its own direction . It can explode you off into side alleys. // McGraw : I don ' t care for illustration , because there is nothing of me there . As an artist , I have to respond with my own life experience. // //
