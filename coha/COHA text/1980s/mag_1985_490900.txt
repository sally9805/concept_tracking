THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment HE Bahais of Iran  --  an indige-TH industrious religious group numbering about three hundred thousand  --  are in extremely serious trouble , both as individuals and as a whole , The cause of their difficulties in Ayatollah Khomeini 's Islamic Republic of Iran is essentially their singular religion , which is a nineteenth-century heretical offshoot of Shiite Islam , the traditional majority faith in the country . Proclaiming the oneness of all religions , the oneness of God , and the oneness of mankind , the Bahais ' founder , a Persian nobleman known as Baha Allah , preached equality of the sexes , racial harmony , and universal education , among other tenets abominable to the Persian establishment . For such preachings , he was imprisoned , tortured , and then exiled until his death , in 1892 . Ever since the religion was founded , the history of the Iranian Bahais has been one of sporadic persecution , and now , under the rule of Ayatollah Khomeini , they are in peril of collectively following an even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to is , pure and simple , the world 's foremost contemporary example of the genocide of a noncombatant people . Consider these offenses against the Bahais : The lingering prejudice against them in Iran has become institutionalized . As that nation 's largest non-Islamic minority , they have been virtually outlawed  --  deprived of whatever rights and liberties are still available under the Khomeini regime . Merely being a member of the Bahai community is now , in effect , a crime . Bahai property has been confiscated . The young are denied education in state-run schools . The adults are prohibited from performing meaningful labor . And , because Bahai marriages are not recognized , Bahai wives are classified as " prostitutes " and the children are labelled " bastards . " The Bahais are summarily accused of being agents of the enemies of the Islamic Republic of Iran ; namely , Americans , Zionists , loyalists of the late Shah , Iraqis , Communists  --  indeed , anyone who differs with the Ayatollah . The fact that the Bahai World Center is in Haifa , Israel  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ottoman Empire  --  is proof positive , in the eyes of the ruling mullahs , of a Bahai-Zionist conspiracy . Bahai shrines and religious sites are often taken over for other purposes or are desecrated and destroyed . To divert attention from Iran 's economic miseries and the unending war with Iraq , the mullahs have incited Shiite mobs to loot , terrorize , beat , and sometimes kill Bahais in well-organized pogroms . Many Bahais physically and financially able to flee the country have done so , leaving their possessions and their relatives behind . And , lastly , with a design not seen in four decades , the Iranian government has set about erasing the Bahais 311 , and their culture from the land . Recently , wholesale arrests and imprisonment of Bahais have led to torture and to execution , by firing squad and hanging . The torture , under the guise of interrogation to uncover anti-Iranian activities and the names of other Bahais , involves such devices as the bastinado , the rack , the rubber hose , and psychological torment . In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body with a chador as they whip her , so that they will not have to view a woman 's bare flesh  --  a sight that is anathema to a good Shiite man . The only aspect of this eradication of a people which remains to be carried out is a more efficient , mechanized method of extermination . If all this is reminiscent of another people at another time in another country by the hand of another despot , one should not be surprised . The world is notorious for blithely forgetting even the recent past . Just before invading Poland , in 1939 , Adolf Hitler is reported to have told his associates that since public opinion soon ignored the genocidal slaughter of the Armenians by the Turks during the First World War the same public would also ignore the obliteration of other peoples by the Germans during the coming war . Today , international bodies and individual governments routinely deplore the Bahais ' plight with puny appeals and redundant calls for further inquiries , and news of recent Bahai executions continues to consist of two-inch items on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ? Possibly nothing . What can be done ? Something can always be done . Genocide  --  defined as the intentional destruction of any national , ethnic , racial , or religious group , in whole or in part  --  was declared an international crime by a United Nations convention in 1948 . The edict has been ratified by ninety-six countries  --  including Iran ( which was a signatory in 1956 ) ? but not by the United States , the one nation that could perhaps put some teeth in it . The Senate 's thirty-six-year refusal to approve the genocide convention , despite even the flagrant reminder of its importance in present-day Iran , has in recent years been the obstructionist work of Jesse Helms , the newly reelected God-fearing senator from North Carolina . But , Helms or no Helms , the Senate could act . Even a first , small step , like ratifying the convention , would be something . ? AYOUNG woman we know writes : Robert Fitzgerald , the poet and translator of the Odyssey , the Iliad , and , very recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well ( some with his classics master from his Choate days , Dudley Fitts ) , died last week , at the age of seventy-four . While I was at Radcliffe , Mr. Fitzgerald was Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard , and he took time from his herculean labors  --  he was then beginning his translation of Virgil  --  to teach an afternoon course during the fall semester in the standard metres of classical and also English poetry . Mr. Fitzgerald , whom we occasionally glimpsed on non-class days wearing his beret and riding his bicycle down Oxford Street , did not address us by our given names in the classroom , and he believed in teaching by example . For a lesson on trochaic tetrameter catalectic , we found four English models on a mimeographed sheet : Home we bring the bald whoremonger : Romans , lock your wives away ... Lonely in the Regent Palace , sipping a banana blush ... In delay there lies no plenty ; Then come kiss me , sweet-andtwenty ! Youth 's a stuff will not endure .

Everyone is JUST so BORING ! Oh , they send me half to sleep . Culled from a Latin legionary song translated by Robert Graves ; from Sir John Betjeman ; from Shakespeare ; and from a former student , respectively . He read all of them aloud . And each week our past week 's attempts at formal verse came back with his discreet mark in the corner : NB , NTB , NTG , or NG ( Not Bad , Not Too Bad , Not Too Good , or Not Good ) . There was also a rare NAAB  --  Not At All Bad  --  and anyone whose paper was so graced was jealously feted . Mr. Fitzgerald retired from the Harvard faculty in 1981 , becoming Boylston Professor Emeritus , and two years later a party was held here in New York , at the Italian Cultural Institute  --  one of the grand old buildings on Park Avenue  --  to honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many months before he became seriously ill , and I remember how hale he looked , and how a sigh of anticipatory pleasure ran through the audience when , carrying his Harvard book bag , he walked jauntily up to the table where he was to read . That evening , before opening his bound galleys , Mr. Fitzgerald mused out loud for a few moments . " You know , " he said , " after a while we get to thinking about what these tales mean to the young people , these old stories , and sometimes it 's hard to know . But last spring my wife was walking through an academic setting , and two young women came up before her on the path , wheeling bicycles . And before they turned off she heard one young woman say to the other , ' You know what I said to him ? I said , " You know that scene where Hector gets dragged by his ankles through the blood and the dust ? Well , " I said , " I hope that happens to you. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to fulfill an assignment , I handed in ninety-odd lines of blank verse  --  nearly ten times the amount requested . The following week , after class , Mr. Fitzgerald asked me if I might stay a moment , and when the other students had trickled out he brought out my poem . Every one of the ninety lines was metrically wrong , except for one or two places where , by what must have been an accident of English grammar , I had slipped into iambic pentameter . Mr. Fitzgerald motioned that I should perhaps sit down . I did , and we sat into the twilight while he discussed every syllable in every line . " I think that if we do this you will get it , " he said . " Think oom pah , oom pah , oom pah . It 's like breathing . " In " Spring Shade , " a collection of Mr. Fitzgerald 's own poems , from 1931 to 1970 , the last lines of the book 's first poem read : The dead Sleep light this wind being overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we received an invitation from Wildlife Conservation International , a division of the New York Zoological Society , that bore a large drawing of a very feathery bird , with the legend " Led through the dense tropical rain forest by a local Gimi guide , the researcher crouches inside a blind to observe the mating display of a bird of paradise . As they watch this splendid creature , the Gimi envisions the spirit of his ancestor ; the scientist one of the last of a spectacular species . " The particulars followed : there was soon to be an evening meeting in the Salon Vendome of the Hotel Parker Meridien on the subject of New Guinea 's birds of paradise . " The Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea is the homeland of 18 species of birds of paradise , " the invitation noted . Wildlife Conservation International , we learned when we joined a large throng in the Salon Vendome , has installed a research site in Papua New Guinea at Ubaigubi , which is accessible in the wet season only by helicopter , and here David and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitats , and working with the local people to encourage them to protect the birds . These locals belong to the Gimi , a language group of ten thousand people living in the Eastern Highlands . With Western assistance , they have built a small tourist lodge for the convenience of visitors who do not mind coming in and going out by helicopter , and the proceeds of such tourism go to the Gimi as an incentive to them to curtail their killing of the birds for the money their skins can bring . Stimulated by this example , the government of Papua New Guinea recently designated an area of more than a thousand square kilometres on Crater Mountain as a national wildlife refuge . The three speakers of the evening , Dr. Donald Bruning and the Gillisons , were introduced by Dr. William Conway , the general director of the New York Zoological Society . He started with a quotation from the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea , the Right Honorable Michael T. Somare , who has written a foreword to the 1979 book " The Birds of Paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William T. Cooper . So-mare said that from the dawn of history New Guinea has been famous for the beauty of its birds of paradise , and that more than four hundred years ago Spanish and Portuguese explorers took home tales of the birds ' magnificence . " But man is seldom content to witness beauty , he must possess it , " Somare wrote . Shortly after those tales were heard , the first skins of the birds were traded in Europe . The birds , however , had long been part of the everyday village life of nearly all Papua New Guinea . People imitated the movements of the birds in their dances . " We shared the environment which was our home , and involved these birds in our spiritual life , " Somare wrote . Dr. Conway went on to speak df Wildlife Conservation International . He listed some of the institute 's interests , and continued , " Each of these projects is a joint program with colleagues and officials in the nations concerned  --  none more so than the birds-of-paradise project in Papua , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoological Society scientists , they are only a part of the team , which includes officials of the government of Papua and advisers from the village of LTbaigubi , where so much of the work is taking place . In this connection , I am especially pleased to be able to welcome here this evening the honorable Renagi Lohia , Ambassador to the United Nations from Papua New Guinea . He is sitting right over here . " He paused , and the audience , applauding , craned necks to look at the honorable Ambassador , bushy-haired and smiling , sitting in the middle of the house with his wife . The birds-of-paradise project , said Dr. Conway , " is uniquely multidisciplinarian : an extraordinary blending of talent and **25;7122;TOOLONG , cultural , artistic , anthropological , and ecological . " He went on to say something about the evening 's speakers . Donald Bruning is the curator of ornithology at the Bronx Zoo . Dr. Gillian Gillison is an anthropologist and has devoted herself to the study of myth and ritual , psychoanalysis , kinship , and art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David Gillison is a wildlife photographer and an artist who became fascinated by the life of other peoples at the age of sixteen , when he lived with a group of desert nomads in Central Australia . Besides working for Wildlife Conservation with his wife , he teaches art and photography at Lehman College . Dr. Conway said we would recognize the Gillisons ' name from their work in the National Geographic . " And now , " he concluded , " Dr. Donald Bruning . " Dr. Bruning told the audience that New Guinea , the second-largest island in the world ( after Greenland ) , is situated just south of the equator and just north of Australia . Most people picture it as a tropical island of dense jungle , but it is not all the same . There are dramatic contrasts : a wet , humid northern coast , a semi-dry southern coast , river valleys , high mountains , rolling hills , huge waterfalls . New Guinea was divided into two at the end of the Second World War . Indonesia administers the northwestern half , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papua , until it attained independence , in 1975 . The island has a great range of populations , habitats , and wildlife . Over twelve thousand species of flowering plants have been described , and there are probably several thousand yet to be discovered . There are also thousands of moths and butterflies , with new species being continually described in scientific journals as exploration goes forward . " There are over seven hundred species of birds , " said Dr. Bruning , " but , because of isolation , there are only a hundred and fifty species of mammals . " Unfortunately , he added , time is running out for much of the forest . Lumbering , mining , and agriculture are rapidly carving away parts of the large tract of forest remaining . ( Slides illustrated this sad fact . ) These practices lead to the destruction of local wildlife habitats and create a significant erosion problem . " As the forests and streams go , so does the wildlife , including the unique group the birds of paradise , " said Dr. Bruning . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New Guinea . In 1929 , The New ? Lee Crandall , curator of birds , had brought back to the Zoological Society the first birds of paradise  --  forty birds of nine species . ( There are forty-two species in all , thirty-six of them unique to New Guinea and nearby islands . ) For many years thereafter , the Zoo had the largest collection in captivity . The last bird died in 1969 , after twenty-seven years in the Zoo , and a new collection was contemplated , but the situation had changed greatly in forty years , emphasis having shifted from mere collecting to the propagation and conservation of rare species . In the nineteen-seventies , Wildlife Conservation International funded a study of the plume trade to determine the effect of traditional hunting of birds of paradise . This helped lead to the passage of laws in 1975 by the independent Papua New Guinea government which affirmed earlier laws forbidding the export of plumes without special permits . In the late nineteen-seventies , the society once more explored the possibility of assembling a new group of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most common species should be acquired , to establish longterm breedings . If these were successful , the society hoped to assist the Papuan government in setting up programs for endangered species . In 1979 , David Gillison came to the Zoo to tell Bruning of the work he and his wife were doing in Papua . Since Brun- Optimism ? ing was about to leave for Australia , Gillison suggested that he go to Papua and visit Ubaigubi . He went , and stayed there four days , watching birds from blinds that Gillison had had the villagers build . Later , Bruning visited officials at the Baiyer River Sanctuary , which is part of Papua New Guinea 's park system , and interested them in preserving the birds of paradise . Two years later , the Gillisons came to New York happy and excited , because the local people had agreed to give control of some of their land to the provincial government to create a protected area for the birds . Then the idea for a tourist lodge was born , and the Zoo made plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , other birds were collected , cleared by the government , and brought to New York  --  the first of their kind to be seen here in ten years . American zoos made arrangements to visit some of the regions of Papua New Guinea that were doomed to destruction , to salvage what they could of the wildlife . Partly as a result of these visits , New York 's Zoological Society now has over twenty birds of paradise , with twelve on exhibit . Dr. Gillian Gillison , who spoke next , had told us earlier that her introduction to Wildlife Conservation International came about gradually . She and her husband , with their little daughter , Samantha , first went to Ubaigubi in 1973 and stayed two years . FEBRUARY 4 , 1985 They returned , on behalf of the National Geographic Society , in 1979 . " Although we made contact with Wildlife Conservation as far back as ' 79 , " she said , " our association did n't become official until ' 83 . " She now showed slides of bamboo flutes that are much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunting music like the sound of birds singing and calling , and they are peculiarly important to Papuans , " she said . When New Guinea boys are ten years old , we learned , they are separated from their mothers , taken to the Men 's House , and taught the mystery of the flutes . They are told that " to become real men they must be like the birds of the forest , gorgeously decorated and bound together in a loyal fraternity , competing for dominance , so that the most beautiful and expressive among them will come to the fore as they are needed , and , in the darkness of the Men 's House , the men perform short plays and skits " portraying birds . The boys , upon seeing the flutes for the first time in their lives , are told that the flutes were invented long ago by a woman . Men stole the flutes from her , but she died without telling other women what the men had done . The flutes give immense power to organize and control society , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow into strong men , and so men must keep this secret from women . " As a woman , I , too , was , of course , excluded from men 's rituals , " Dr. Gillison said . " Men often speak of the rain forest as a sacred realm  --  as their refuge from women and from their ordinary life within the settlement . When they play flutes in the forest , their spirits soar with the birds , escaping women on the ground below . " Dr. Gillison went on to say , " I was able to work only as a collaborator with David Gillison . He came to New Guinea as an artist and photographer to conduct a separate study of male ritual and body decoration , looking for parallels between his work as a Western artist and images in New Guinea art . To David , the men said repeatedly , ' If you want to understand us and to know our rituals , you 've got to understand the birds . ' They took him with them into the rain forest to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They told him , she said , that they modelled their rites of initiation upon the behavior of a certain bird when it emerges from its nest . When the Gillisons first went to Ubaigubi , they found the villagers occupying about twenty compounds scattered along a mountain shelf . Many people still follow a segregated pattern of living . Men and initiated boys sleep in the Men 's House , and mothers , wives , and daughters in smaller houses around the edges of the compound . Gardens surround the houses . A man may visit his wife but even today he generally returns to the Men 's House to sleep . When Dr. Gillison asked women what happened to their sons after they left home to enter the Men 's House , she was told that they had no idea . The Papuans believe that the spirits of the dead enter birds of paradise and sometimes rebuke poachers , saying , " You are shooting at your brothers . " David Gillison , however , said in his turn that the spirit of reverence toward birds did not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temptation to sell the valuable skins was strong . During his work , the conversation always turned to the birds of paradise . The men insisted that he go into the forest and sit for hours in blinds . Thus he was able to see the whole complex ritualistic display of the birds ' courtship behavior , which he illustrated for the audience with a succession of remarkable slides .
