Three men are seated around the table ; CHARLIE DONOVAN . the manager , PHIL BUTLER , public relations head , JERRY SIMMONS , operations director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel Donovan taps his pencil impatiently , obviously waiting for somebody . &nbsp; DONOVAN ( checking his watch ) Thirty minutes late . Think she 'll show ? &nbsp; MATTHEWSShe 's got to . She 's the damn owner now . &nbsp; DONOVANShe did n't last week . She was having a guava facial . As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is , the conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY-BODYGUARD enters , clearing the way for MRS . RACHEL PHELPS , a flashy , striking woman in her early forties . Despite the designer clothes she favors , there is the hint of something less refined about her . She carries a Pekinese dog , CHA-CHA on her left hip . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians ' baseball . The men applaud , but their hearts are barely in it . The Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and Rachel sits . &nbsp; RACHEL ( CONT . ) I know that it may not seem the same without Donald here this year , but I promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history . Several eyes roll up around the room . &nbsp; RACHEL ( CONT. ) ( picking up a newspaper ) Unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that . . .

"  --  4  --  Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away . &nbsp; RACHEL ( CONT . ) Obviously , Donald did n't feel that way or he would n't have left the team to me . And I was more than showgirl . I was a dancer . Now , I know some of you have doubts about my ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out about it . This causes a few nervous glances in the room . &nbsp; RACHEL ( CONT . ) Spring training begins in two weeks .

Donovan , Butler and Simmons pour over the list . &nbsp; RACHEL ( CONT . ) I could sit here and tell you what a great year we 're gon na have , but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency . We have n't won a pennant in 30 years . We have n't even finished in the first division for 15 . Obviously it 's time to make some changes . What do ya think ? &nbsp; SIMMONSI never heard of half these guys . And the ones I do know are way past their prime . &nbsp; DONOVANMost of these guys never had a prime . &nbsp; BUTLER ( pointing to the sheet ) This guy here is dead . &nbsp; RACHELCross him off then . &nbsp; BUTLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  5  --  &nbsp; RACHELIt 's time to shake things up , Charlie .

That 's why I 'm movin ' you up to General Manager . Congratulations . Rachel sticks out her hand . Donovan shakes it somewhat feebly , bewildered by this whole development . &nbsp; RACHEL ( CONT . ) Well , that should do it for today . Thank you , gentlemen . Let 's get to work .

( referring to the roster ) Some of these guys are furniture movers ? &nbsp; RACHELI 'm serious about this , Charlie . It 's no secret I 've never liked Cleveland much . The weather 's lousy , downtown is a pit , the stadium 's falling apart , and we ca n't draw dick . Another couple of years of this and I 'm gon na have to start feeding Cha-Cha dog food .

Phelps , you ca n't just up and move a team on a whim . . .  --  8  --  &nbsp; RACHELIt 's hardly a whim . Miami 's offered to build us a new stadium  --  62,000 capacity , 45 V.I.P. boxes , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 12 million dollar media guarantee ; 45 percent of the concession gross , all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs . No other franchise in baseball can match that deal . &nbsp; DONOVANEven so , the League 'll never let us leave Cleveland . We got a lease with the city . &nbsp; RACHELThe lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year . ( pushing across a copy of the lease ) Paragraph 40 , line 17 . Donovan looks at it , the paragraph highlighted in yellow . &nbsp; RACHEL ( CONT . ) If we play bad enough , we should be able to come in under that . &nbsp; DONOVANWhat are you saying ? You want us to lose ? &nbsp; RACHELNo , we 've been losing . What I want us to do is finish dead last . Donovan is stunned .

Vaughn goes in his locker and finds that a slit has been cut in the back of his cap to accommodate his pigtail . Suppressed laughs are heard from several corners of the locker room . 30 INT . CLUBHOUSE - MORNING Brown is addressing his troops before the first workout . &nbsp; BROWNWelcome to Spring Training , gentlemen . Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open , that nobody 's a lock at any position , and that talent is n't everything . They 'd rather see desire and discipline in a player .

Dorn and Gentry a good 10-yard lead , but Hayes is coming like a buliet . We go to SLOW MOTION as Hayes draws even at the 80-yard mark and blasts on by to win by five . This kid is fast . Brown and Pepper give each other the " Who was that Masked Man " look . &nbsp; BROWNGet him a uniform . 35 EXT . THE PRACTICE FIELD - LONG SHOT - DAY The players are spread out on the field doing calisthenics , counting off in unison . 36 TAYLOR struggling through a series of pushups . He glances over in disbelief at Vaughn and Cerrano , who are doing them like pistons in competition with each other . Cerrano even starts doing them one-handed . Hayes is n't doing them at all ; merely pulling his head up and down while leaving his body on the ground . &nbsp; HARRISC'mon , Hayes , let 's do ' em right . &nbsp; HAYESHey , my philosophy is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAGE - DAY Taylor is crouched behind the plate , warming up his arm .

So , I want the absolute truth here . Are you 100 percent ? &nbsp; TAYLORYeh . Would I bullshit about somethin ' like that ? &nbsp; BROWN ( walking away ) You better if you wan na make this team . Taylor smiles and fires one full-speed down to second . It bounces two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAGE - DAY Brown is watching batting practice . Hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual worthy of Babe Ruth  --  rubbing dirt on his hands , stretching , knocking dirt off his spikes , twirling the bat , etc . A real slugger 's routine . &nbsp; BROWNC'mon , Hayes , this is n't the All Star Game . Get up to the damn plate . Hayes gets in and takes his stance . On the first pitch , he takes a mighty cut and hits a pop-fly to the pitcher 's mound . We take QUICK CUTS of the next three pitches . Hayes takes prodigious swings at all of them , producing three more pop-ups , none out of the infield . Brown calls a halt .  --  22  --  &nbsp; BROWN ( CONT . ) Well , you may run like Mays , but you hit like shit . &nbsp; HAYESMy stroke 'll come back once I get warmed up . &nbsp; TEMPLE ( referring to some stats ) Never did get warmed up last year . Hit .211 at Maine . I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise . His speed could be a big asset . &nbsp; PEPPER ( aside ) For what ? Running back to the dugout ? &nbsp; BROWNYou got ta stop swingin ' for the fences though , Hayes . All you 're gon na do is give yourself a hernia . With your speed you should be hittin ' the ball on the ground , leggin ' ' em out . Every time I see you hit one in the air , you owe me twenty pushups . &nbsp; HAYESHey , no problem . The next pitch comes in . Hayes swings and pops it up . &nbsp; HAYES ( CONT . ) Shit . As he gets down to do his twenty , Brown turns to Temple . &nbsp; BROWNSometimes you can teach a guy to hit . You ca n't teach him to run . 39 BROWN AND PEPPER coming over to where Vaughn is tossing some casual warm-up pitches to Jake .  --  23  --  &nbsp; BROWN ( CONT . ) All right , Vaughn , they tell us you 're a pitcher . Let 's see what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better view . Vaughn goes into his wind-up and fires a screaming fast ball that Taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch . The ball rockets an inch over Brown 's head , and slams into the backstop . Brown stands frozen a second , contemplating his brush with eternity , then turns to Pepper . &nbsp; BROWNNice velocity . &nbsp; PEPPERSounded like it . &nbsp; TAYLORSorry , Lou , I was n't quite expectin ' that much octane . Brown turns to the Clubhouse Man who 's holding a speed gun . &nbsp; BROWNHow much ? &nbsp; CLUBHOUSE MAN96 miles an hour . &nbsp; BROWN ( to Pepper ) Better teach him some control before he kills somebody . 40 RODGER BECK fielding grounders at third base . He plays them off to his left side a bit , almost as if he 's afraid to get bit by them . &nbsp; BROWNC'mon , Beck , get in front of the damn ball . ( making like a bullfighter ) Do n't give me this ole ' bullshit . &nbsp; BECKI took one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; BROWNI 'm deeply moved . Every time you play it off your hip , you give me forty sit-ups.  --  24  --  &nbsp; DORNWhat ! That 's Little League shit . &nbsp; BROWNSo is this . Brown strikes an effeminate fielding position , like Betty Grable shying from a mouse . Dorn burns . 41 PEDRO CERRANO in the batting cage , knocking the cover off pitch after pitch with his black bat . &nbsp; BROWNJesus , this guy hits a ton . How come nobody else picked up on him ? &nbsp; TEMPLE ( to the batting practice pitcher ) Okay , Harris , that 's enough fast balls . Throw some curves . Harris winds and throws a fair-to-middlin ' curve ball . Cerrano swings and misses it a foot . &nbsp; BROWNOh . Beck approaches Brown at the cage . &nbsp; DORNLou , I wan na have a word with you here . &nbsp; BROWNSure . &nbsp; DORN ( whipping out his contract ) Those penalty sit-ups you want me to do ? I got it right here in my contract that I do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do ya think of that ? Everyone around the batting cage has stopped what they 're doing to see how Brown will react . Brown looks at the contract a second , then drops it on the ground , unzips his fly , and gives it a golden shower . On Dorn 's stunned face , we . . . CUT TO :  --  25  --  42 BECK doing sit-ups in the infield . Vaughn walks by and smiles . 43 LONGSHOT - PRACTICE FIELD Practically every member of the team is doing penalty calisthenics somewhere on the field . &nbsp; PEPPER ( to Temple ) We got anybody left playin ' baseball out there ? 44 INT . THE LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON Taylor , Hayes and Vaughn drag in , looking beat from the day 's workout . &nbsp; TAYLORShit , the way I played today , I would n't be surprised if they red-tagged me already . &nbsp; HAYESWhat do ya mean ? &nbsp; TAYLORRed tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you , ' cause you just died and went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , afraid to open it now . &nbsp; TAYLOR ( CONT . ) Do n't worry , they do n't cut anybody the first day . Vaughn is still not so sure . He sits down on his locker stool and glances over toward STEVE HARRIS a starting pitcher , whose locker is adjacent . As Harris takes off his jersey we see three SPLOTCHES OF GREASY SUBSTANCES on his chest , just inside the button line . &nbsp; VAUGHNWhat is that stuff ? &nbsp; HARRIS ( pointing to them in order ) Crisco , Bardahl , Vagisil . Any one of ' em will give you another 2-3 inches drop on your curve ball .  --  26  --  Vaughn ca n't believe this . &nbsp; HARRIS ( CONT . ) Course if it 's cold and I got a shirt on under my jersey , I just rub a little jalapeno inside my nose and get it runnin ' . I need to load up the ball a little , I just wipe my nose . &nbsp; VAUGHN ( revolted ) You put snot on the ball ? &nbsp; HARRISAt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I have n't got an arm like yours . Vaughn just looks at him incredulous . TAYLOR AND CARRANO Taylor is undressing , but his attention is diverted by Cerrano whose stall is right next to him . Cerrano has set up an altar in his locker . In front of his bats , which are lined up like sentinels , is a table covered with pictures of baseball players , figurines of saints , several lit candles and , in the middle , a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth . Cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats . He finishes an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll . &nbsp; TAYLORWhat are you doin ' there , Pedro ? &nbsp; CERRANOBats . They are sick . &nbsp; TAYLORSo are mine . Is somethin ' goin ' around ? &nbsp; CERRANONo hit curve ball . Straight ball , hit it very much . Curve ball , bats are afraid . I ask Jo-Buu to come .

Do n't celebrate in front of guys who just died . &nbsp; HAYESWhat if we 're one of the deceased ? Taylor goes into the locker room . Hayes and Vaughn hang back . Cerrano is already at his locker . He 's got two snakes this time and some kind of voodoo head dress on . He sprays a patch of white paint on the locker door from a spray can , draws a symbol  --  30  --  door . No tag . He kisses the snake , leaving some white paint on his lips , like a kid who 's just had a glass of milk . Taylor , exhausted from the game , lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Cerrano offers a hand . Taylor shakes it and breaks a weary smile . 47A GENTRY opens locker , slumps on stool .

Hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open . This does n't tell him much , however , because he 's got his eyes closed . He stands that way a beat ot two , then opens one eye . Seeing no tag , he turns and walks double-time out of the locker room , as if he had to get to the john . He comes outside , turns a corner , and starts leaping around like a wild man . 49 VAUGHN drawing strength from Hayes , walks resolutely to his locker and whips it open . There hanging from the top hook is the " red death .

I counted up your ballots for team captain and I think you chose the right guy . If you had n't , I woulda told you he won anyway . Mr. C for the year  --  Jake Taylor . The team breaks into applause and whistles as Taylor 's name is announced . Dorn is the only one who seems unhappy about it . As Taylor accepts the congratulations of his teammates , he turns to Vaughn . &nbsp; TAYLORForget about Dorn .

I belong to the church of three-run homers . &nbsp; HARRISAll right , let 's bow our heads . Many of the players follow suit .

MUNICIPAL STADIUM PRESS BOX - DAY We get our fist glimpse of HARRY DOYLE , the Indians ' 55-year-old radio announcer . Harry 's never walked past a bar in anger . He 's been with the Indians through thin and thinner . &nbsp; DOYLE ( on the air ) Hello , everybody , Harry Doyle here , welcoming all you Friends of the Feather to another season of Indians baseball . ( pouring some Jack Daniels in his Coke ) A lotta new faces for the tribe this year , as they take on the defending American League champs , the New York Yankees . And listen to the roar of the crowd as the Indians takes the field ! Doyle leans out the press box window with his mike , trying to pick up the sound of a couple guys CLAPPING down below . &nbsp; DOYLE ( CONT . ) Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doyle takes a hit of his spiked Coke . 65 DOWN ON THE FIELD A YANKEE HITTER flies out to Hayes , who makes a " basket " catch a la Willie Mays . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) High fly ball , centerfield . Hayes under it now . . . Oh , makes a basket catch , Willie Mays style , and the side is retired . 66 THE INDIAN DUGOUT The team comes in off the field to much enthusiasm and back-slapping.  --  41  --  &nbsp; BROWNAll right , way to look , way to look . Nice catch , Hayes . Do n't ever fuckin ' do it again .

Rudia knocks it down , gets up , fires to first . Too late ! Hayes beats it ! Doyle leans out the window again trying to pick up some cheering . &nbsp; DOYLEAnd so the string is broken . Maybe things will turn around a little for the Indians this year . 69 THE BLEACHERS Our four fans ( from here on known as the Bleacher Band ) , overjoyed by Hayes ' hit , start beating the tom-toms and singing a fight song they 've composed called " In the Land Of Burning Waters " to the tune of the old Hamms Beer jingle .  --  42  --  &nbsp; BLEACHER BANDIn the land of burning waters , waters Lurks the Injun nine , oh so fine , we Love those mighty Redmen , Turn their foes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes comes back to the bag , where the Yankee FIRST BASEMAN is waiting for him . &nbsp; FIRST BASEMANShowed some real power on that one , Slugger . &nbsp; HAYESI plan to get at least a double out of it . Hayes reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of the pairs of black leather gloves he bought earlier . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) And now Hayes is putting on a pair of black gloves , sending a little message to the Yankees . &nbsp; HAYES ( to the First Baseman ) Bought a hundred of these , one for each base I plan to steal . Excuse me , here , I got ta take my first step toward the Hall of Fame . Hayes takes his lead-off and crouches , ready to steal . &nbsp; FIRST BASEMANYou look real sharp , but you 'll never steal second with your shoe untied . Hayes looks down at his shoe . It 's not untied . He notices too late that the PITCHER is throwing over to pick him off . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) Brewster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for the bag , but never gets there ; his face smashing up against the First Baseman 's glove , which is already holding the ball . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) ( CONT . ) He got him .

Hayes lies in the dust humiliated . &nbsp; DOYLEWell , so much for that . Doyle takes a long pull on his Coke and we GO INTO A MONTAGE depicting the Indians ' progressive disintegration in this game . We see : A ) THREE FIELDERS converging on a short pop fly into left field . They all collide and go down in a heap as the ball drops untouched . B ) BECK playing a grounder off his hip . He fumbles it , picks it up , fumbles it again . No play . C ) TAYLOR crouched behind the plate , but up off his haunches , ready to throw . We hear the voice of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got ta be goin ' . . . get the throw up . Do n't bounce the damn ball . The runner on first takes off as the pitch comes in . Taylor catches the ball and fires down to second . The ball sails three feet over the second baseman 's head and on into center field . Taylor stands there , disgusted . &nbsp; TAYLOR 'S VOICE ( CONT . ) Nice throw , dickhead . D ) CERRANO striking out on a curve ball . He bawls his bat out on the way to the dugout . E ) THE THREE FIELDERS we saw before , converging on another pop fly into short left . This time all three dive off at the last instant to avoid a collision . Once again the ball drops untouched . END MONTAGE . 71 THE SCOREBOARD It shows Yankees 4 , Indians 0 after five innings . 72 DOYLE UP IN THE BOOTH There are two empty Coca-Cola cups near the mike . He 's working on a third .  --  44  --  &nbsp; DOYLETop of the sixth . Rookie sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can close the book on Winters . . . Vaughn stands on the mound rubbing up the baseball with the same intensity we saw in the locker room . &nbsp; TAYLOREasy does it , Ricky . We 're only four down . We 're still in this thing . &nbsp; PEPPERDo n't worry if you 're off the plate on a few pitches . Does n't hurt to put the fear of God in a hitter . Vaughn nods and continues to grind the ball as Pepper and Taylor leave . The Yankee Hitter steps in . Vaughn winds and fires a screamer . Taylor has to leap high to come down with it . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) First pitch is a little high . . . The Yankee Hitter is slightly unnerved by this pitch . &nbsp; YANKEE HITTERThis guy kinda wild ? &nbsp; TAYLORI figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat . ANOTHER PITCH to the Yankee hitter . It 's outside . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) Ball four . ANOTHER PITCH to a SECOND YANKEE HITTER . It 's low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a THIRD YANKEE HITTER . He has to jump over it . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) Low , and Vaughn has walked the bases loaded on twelve straight pitches . ( MORE )  --  45  --  &nbsp; DOYLE ( Cont 'd ) By the laws of probability , you 'd think one of those coulda drifted over the plate . THE BLEACHER BAND Bobby gives the downbeat and , in honor of Vaughn , the three men stand to pound out a version of " Wild Thing " on the tom-toms . Bobby does the vocal . &nbsp; BOBBYWild thing , You make my heart sing , You walk everything . Pepper has reached the mound . . . &nbsp; PEPPEROkay kid . I think we got ' em scared enough now . Time to get a few of ' em out . Vaughn nods . He 's plenty upset with himself . &nbsp; PEPPER ( CONT . ) Just relax , and keep the arm up on top . Got ta throw strikes . No place at the inn for this guy . He gives Vaughn a pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Yankee hitter , HAYWOOD , stands in . He 's the first baseman who tagged Hayes out . &nbsp; HAYWOODHey , Taylor , what you doin ' back up here ? &nbsp; TAYLORCould n't cut it in the Mexican League . Vaughn , determined to throw a strike , winds and delivers . The ball is a perfect strike , right down the middle . Haywood crushes it to deep left field . Vaughn drops his head , not even bothering to look . &nbsp; VAUGHNOh , shit . . . The ball lands in the second deck ; a grand slam home run .  --  46  --  &nbsp; PEPPER ( to Brown ) Looked like a strike anyway . You want me to go get him ? &nbsp; BROWNNo , let 's see how he reacts . Vaughn paces around on the mound , rubbing up the ball . The next hitter , COLEMAN , steps in . Vaughn gets up on the rubber , his face set . He winds up and fires one right into Coleman 's back . Coleman goes down in a hurry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aimin ' at . &nbsp; BROWN ( CONT . ) I think you can go get him now . Both benches are up on the dugout steps ready to come out . The only thing holding them back is that Coleman is being tended to by the trainer . The home plate umpire thumbs Vaughn out of the game . Vaughn comes down to protest , but Pepper quickly grabs him and hurries him off the field . &nbsp; PEPPERC'mon , kid . As soon as Coleman gets up , he 's gon na be lookin ' for you . Coleman finally gets to his feet , still a little shaken . He looks around for Vaughn , but he 's already disappeared into the dugout . Coleman walks down to first under his own power . Brown signals for a new pitcher and the players on both sides begin to return to the benches . 73 VAUGHN walking alone down the tunnel to the locker room . He angrily knocks one of the overhead light bulbs out with his glove . 74 DOYLE IN THE PRESS BOX - LATER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mike , plus a near-empty bottle of Jack Daniel's.  --  47  --  &nbsp; DOYLESo , a tough start for the Erie warriors , as they drop a heartbreaker to the Yankees , nine to nothing .

He hit the damn homer . Coleman was just picking his nose in the on-deck circle . Vaughn nods slowly . &nbsp; TAYLOR ( CONT . ) Forget the other stuff . It coulda happened to anybody . Besides , Haywood did n't hit it that good . That ball would n't have been out of a lotta parks .  --  48  --  &nbsp; VAUGHNOh yeh , name one . &nbsp; TAYLOR ( after a pause ) Yellowstone .

Meanwhile , Brown is going jaw to jaw with Wingo , outraged at the call . Brown pulls a carrot out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who immediately thumbs him out . 119 LYNN leaving her seat and starting up the aisle . Taylor comes up the stairs from the locker room , still in full uniform . He emerges onto the box level to see Lynn disappearing down the ramp toward the parking lot .  --  76  --  120 LYNN in the parking lot . As she goes to unlock her car , Taylor looks around hurriedly for some kind of vehicle to follow her in . He bangs on the bullpen gates and is admitted by the guard . Inside is the Bullpen car , a souped-up golf cart with a body shaped like a batting helmet . Taylor hops in and roars out after Lynn . 121 INT . CLEVELAND ATHLETIC CLUB - NIGHT Lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area , deserted this time of night . She wears a racing suit , but lets her hair hang free . The pool glows like a sheet of emerald glass . She shakes down a beat , curls her toes around the coping , slowly bends at the waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley ; first the butterfly , then the backstroke , breaststroke and finally freestyle . We condense the time , of course , SHOOTING some underwater , some SLO-MO , as she knives through the water , her hair flowing behind her , an athlete alone with her medium . The SEQUENCE should convey not only the grace of her strokes and her athletic ability , but the fluid beauty of swimming , its synthesis of power and form . As she begins the freestyle leg , another body appears in the pool next to her . It 's Jake , and he 's racing her the final lap . She immediately responds to the challenge , digging harder , picking up her kick . They go neck and neck for 20 yards , but Lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a body length at the wall . Both are winded . &nbsp; TAYLORYou still got that great kick . Just like the first time I ever saw you . &nbsp; LYNNYou follow me here too ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; LYNNWhat do you mean ? &nbsp; TAYLORYou would n't have been at the game if you did n't want to see me about something .  --  77  --  &nbsp; LYNN ( getting out of the pool ) I just wanted to see you play . &nbsp; TAYLORHow was I ? &nbsp; LYNNYou looked good , but you ought a open your stance a little .

LYNN 'S CAR - NIGHT Driving through the city on her way home . Lynn glances in the rear-view mirror and spots Taylor following her . She smiles to herself . Taylor , of course , thinks he 's gone undetected . We begin a SHORT SEQUENCE during which Lynn tries to lose Taylor in a chase through Cleveland , car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out in Cleveland , but suffice it to say , by the end of the chase she appears to have ditched him . 123 EXT . LYNN 'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Lynn comes up the stairs , unlocks the apartment door and steps inside . There 's no particular urgency . She feels sure she 's shaken Taylor . The apartment is full of packing boxes . Tired from the chase , Lynn drops her bag on a box and slumps down on the couch . It 's obvious she 's not all that happy to have lost Taylor . She goes to the window and looks down to the street for some sign of him .  --  78  --  Seeing nothing , she turns away from the window disappointed , and starts back to the couch , when something stops her . It 's Taylor , standing in the doorway . &nbsp; TAYLORWhose place are we at this time ? &nbsp; LYNN ( flustered ) Mine . You follow me again ? &nbsp; TAYLORYeh . When I saw you at the game , I figured you wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play . &nbsp; TAYLORHow was I ? &nbsp; LYNNYou looked good , but you ought a open your stance a little . They 're pitchin ' you inside . &nbsp; TAYLORI 'll try that . Taylor gives a perfunctory nod . They look at each other a second . There 's still plenty there . Taylor begins to come toward her . We hear his cleats on the floor . She backs off , but not with real conviction . &nbsp; LYNNI think I ought a tell you that I 'm moving in with Tom . &nbsp; TAYLORGoin ' uptown , huh ? &nbsp; LYNNI 'm not goin ' uptown , I just want to lead a regular life . You know , like an adult maybe . With a house and a garden and normal hours . &nbsp; TAYLORYou think I ca n't lead a regular life ? &nbsp; LYNNYou like the life you 've had , Jake . You like hangin ' out with the boys , livin ' in hotels , eatin ' dinner at midnight , having girls send you their underwear in the mail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ) Remember the surprise party I threw for you when you made the All-Star team ? You never showed up , but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture . It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit . &nbsp; TAYLORThat was a hoax . The girl was just trying to get some publicity . &nbsp; LYNNYes , but you had obviously been with her . And it happened in front of all our friends . &nbsp; TAYLORI was drownin ' , Lynn . The endorsements were dryin ' up , my knees were goin ' , they were talkin ' about sendin ' me down . I was just trying to hold on to somethin ' , prove to myself I was still an All-Star . I do n't care about that anymore . I know I do n't have much time left in baseball . I 'm just a guy trying to put his life back together . Thinkin ' about you was the only thing that kept me goin ' in Mexico . Lynn looks at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you too many times , Jake . I ca n't afford to believe you anymore . Lynn is backed up against a desk now . She could move out but does n't . &nbsp; TAYLORI guess this is our last hurrah then . &nbsp; LYNNI guess so . Did you really read " Moby Dick ? " &nbsp; TAYLORCover to cover .  --  80  --  Taylor comes forward to kiss her , tentatively at first . Their conversation is interwoven with the slowly deepening intensity of their kissing . &nbsp; TAYLOR ( CONT . ) When 's the wedding ? &nbsp; LYNNOctober third . &nbsp; TAYLORYour mom and dad like this guy ? &nbsp; LYNNYou 're still their favorite . They 're unbuttoning each other 's shirts now . &nbsp; TAYLORGonna be a big wedding ? &nbsp; LYNNTom does n't like big weddings .

Their shirts are off now . &nbsp; LYNN ( CONT . ) This does n't change anything , you know . We were always good at this . &nbsp; TAYLORLynn ? &nbsp; LYNNWhat ? &nbsp; TAYLORThe zipper on your skirt is stuck . &nbsp; LYNNUse your imagination . Taylor 's spikes come down across her skirt , catching in the material , ripping it from her body and pinning it to the wood floor . Taylor steps out of the shoe and whisks Lynn OUT OF FRAME . We hold on the skirt , nailed to the floor by the cleats. 124 INT . LYNN 'S BEDROOM - MORNING Taylor wakens and turns over to find Lynn gone . He looks around but there 's no sign of her . 125 EXT .

Rachel does not look pleased .  --  82  --  &nbsp; RACHELWell , my worst fears have been confirmed . We 're 60 and 60 , nine games out of first , and only two out of the first division . Who do those guys think they are ? &nbsp; DONOVANMaybe you just have to accept the fact that they 're not as bad as you 'd hoped . &nbsp; RACHELI do n't have to accept anything . Our attendance is only beginning to rise . If we can force a losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn this thing around . The fans are used to losers here .

CUT TO : Section Details 128 EXT . RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY We pick up a decrepit old Greyhound bus coming down the highway , belching smoke like a diesel semi .

YANKEE STADIUM - DAY Vaughn is on the mound warming up . &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) So , Ricky Vaughn , roughed up in his only other appearance against the Yankees , will see what he can do with the Bronx Bombers this time . Vaughn , after a slow start , has come on lately and now leads the American League in strikeouts with 221 . Vaughn finishes his warmups . As Taylor pumps the ball down to second , Vaughn hears a voice from the Yankee dug-out . &nbsp; VOICEHey , jailbird ! Vaughn glances over and sees that one of the Yankees is dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earrings , high heels , and of course , glasses . Vaughn tries to ignore the guy , but his concentration is broken . Vaughn steps up on the rubber for his first pitch . He winds and fires . The Yankee LEADOFF HITTER rips a one-hopper to the wall in right center . Hayes runs it down and guns it back to the infield to hold the guy to a double . The convict whoops it up . Vaughn gets back up on the rubber . As he comes to the stretch , he catches sight of the convict again . The guy is doing a pantomime , sneaking up to a car and picking the lock , much to the delight of his teammates . Vaughn throws his pitch in the dirt and all the way to the backstop . The runner on second goes to third . &nbsp; TAYLOR ( throwing the ball back ) C'm on , Rick baby , settle down .  --  85  --  Vaughn gets ready again .

As Vaughn comes to his stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in jail now , struggling against the bars . Finally he bends over and grabs his ankles , while one of his teammates humps up against him , pretending to bugger him . This sends the Yankee bench into hysterics . Vaughn has lost it now . He fires to the plate and Haywood creams another tape measure job into the upper deck . Hayes does n't even bother to run back to the wall . He just watches it go . 6-0 Yankees . &nbsp; BROWNI thought now that Vaughn had some control , he was ready for the Yankees . &nbsp; PEPPERNot quite yet . Brown makes his way to the mound to take Vaughn out .  --  86  --  &nbsp; DOYLE ( V.O. ) So , Vaughn pitches in some tough luck here as the Yankees put together as few squib hits and take a 6-0 lead . 137 DOYLE in the press box . The stadium below is empty , the grounds crew covering the infield . &nbsp; DOYLEWell , the Indians made a gallant comeback today , but fell one run short as the Yankees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do squat after the first inning .

I think we 're a first division team right now . &nbsp; DONOVANYou really believe that , do n't you ? &nbsp; BROWNI know it . All we need is something to bring it all together . &nbsp; DONOVANRachel Phelps would never allow that . &nbsp; BROWNWhat do you mean ? &nbsp; DONOVANShe does n't want you in the first division .
