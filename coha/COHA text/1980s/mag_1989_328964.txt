The situation demanded strong words , and President Carlos Saul Menem did not shrink from using them . In his July 8 inaugural address , Menem urged his citizens to " Get up and walk ! " Argentina , he declared , " is broken , devastated , razed . Inflation has reached chilling levels , but we are n't going to administer the decline . We will pulverize the crisis . " <P> Just 36 hours after Menem 's address , his administration announced the first steps of " unusually severe , exceptional and emergency " measures designed to break the nation 's hyperinflation ( 114% for June alone ) and to restore confidence in its virtually insolvent government . Among them : a 90-day wage- and-price freeze , a 116% devaluation of the austral to 650 vs. the U.S. dollar and an aggressive privatization of most state-run companies . Because the end of many government subsidies will bring unavoidable price increases for some goods and services , all workers will be given a bonus of 8,000 australes ( $12.30 at the new rate ) . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already showing some positive effects . On Monday the black-market rate for dollars dipped below the official exchange rate for the first time since the austral plan was implemented by former President Raul Alfonsin in 1985 , demonstrating credibility in the currency 's new valuation .

The announced end of government subsidies for gasoline pushed prices up 670% , to the equivalent of $1.60 per gal . In anticipation of a 350% rise in subway and train fares , commuters flocked to stations to stock up on tokens . <P> Most foreign bankers have greeted Menem 's plan with hedged optimism . But since Argentina has failed to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank , neither agency is eager to issue fresh credits without some proof of economic progress . " What 's announced on paper can be very different from the results , " said a U.S. credit analyst . <P> To stem the government 's deficit spending , which reached $9.7 billion last year , Menem plans to increase revenues by simplifying the tax-collection system and increasing levies on exported goods . But most economists believe that Menem 's most important task will be to privatize Argentina 's inefficient state-owned monopolies , which are losing $4 billion annually . Menem may get the power to do so if the Argentine Congress approves a new emergency law that would give him almost unlimited control over the nationalized companies . But Menem has so far offered no details about his privatization drive . Those particulars are not likely to come soon . On Friday , only six days after joining Menem 's Cabinet , Economic Minister Miguel Roig died of a heart attack . His replacement , businessman Nestor Rapanelli , will be the fourth Economic Minister since March 31 , when Juan Sourrouille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
