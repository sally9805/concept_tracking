In Jimmy Carter 's small and tranquil study down the hall from the Oval Office , a black loose-leaf notebook takes up a proud place on a bookshelf that is crowded from end to end with epics of man 's struggles through wars , pestilence and economic disaster . The notebook is warmed by sunlight and caressed by piped-in Brahms . That is fitting . Within the notebook 's 111 tidy pages , divided by ten pink tabs , is a fantasy that needs sunbursts and violins . <P> It is the story of a U.S. freed of dependence on foreign energy , cleansing its air and water , dispensing swift justice , conquering unemployment , choking inflation , producing more arms with less money , rejuvenating railroads , preserving families and banishing cancer . That notebook is Carter 's book of promises , a compilation of the hundreds of pledges he made in the 1976 campaign . The guessing even within Carter 's own staff is that the promise book has not been taken down and read very much in recent weeks . <P> It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of the political delivery gap . Those other men running for Carter 's job should read it . Within the promise book is virtually every goal and at least the germ of almost every idea that the challengers are now so ardently proclaiming on the campaign trail . In hindsight 's cruel light , we see that the promise book is a gaudy shell wrapped around a void . There is hardly a word about implementing these dreams . So it is in this campaign . The candidates describe how lovely life will be in their fairylands , but they rarely talk about how they are going to get there . That is because getting there is almost no fun at all . <P> In the bad old days of traditional politics , a President had some prestige , there were generally resources available , and the system had enough cohesion to move forward with modest coaxing . The central political question now may be whether our constitutional system is still functional . The nation 's problems are not hard to find . Often there are several sensible ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard , boring job of putting together political coalitions or using the crude devices at hand in order to get real results . <P> When Ted Kennedy proposed wage and price controls he issued a two-paragraph explanation of how he would " announce a freeze " that would last from four to six months , and " during that time we would put into place other programs such as gasoline rationing . . . " But " announcing " and " putting , " so casually stated by the Senator , would be in today 's world like moving mountains . John Anderson is an evangelist for " the power of ideas , " of which he has many , like the 50 gasoline tax to reduce consumption and ease other tax burdens . But Anderson 's determined advocacy of ideas during his 20 years in Congress tended to isolate him . He was a preacher more than a mover . <P> Ronald Reagan would create a new regional power base through a " North American accord . " He would stop " grinding out printing-press money . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would persuade and arbitrate the conflicting interests in both tasks .
