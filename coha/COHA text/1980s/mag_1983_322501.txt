A new drug for cat leukemia <P> An epidemic is ravaging America 's cats . About 10% of the 40 million cats in the U.S. are victims of a type of leukemia that attacks the animals ' immune systems and is usually fatal . The disease , which does not affect humans or other animals , is easily transmitted among cats . For the past 2 years , Norden Laboratories , a Nebraska-based division of the SmithKline Beckman drug company , has been working on a vaccine that inhibits the growth of leukemia in cats . Says Product Manager Reynolds Davis : " If everything goes smoothly , we could have a product out in 1984 . " With testing nearly complete and a cure rate of 80% to 95% , Norden is working to expand production to mass-market scale . <P> Norden Laboratories ( 1982 sales : $148 million ) already sells a wide variety of animal pharmaceutical products , including heartworm tablets for dogs and parasite preventives for horses . If the drug company can win Government licensing for the vaccine , it will open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to medical care for their pets , spending about $800 million annually . Says Dr. Joan Arnoldi , president of the American Association of Feline Practitioners : " There is a need for this product . It is an excellent idea for feline fanciers of all sorts and a special boon to breeders , who often have to contend with very expensive outbreaks of the disease . " <P> A big drawback to the wide use of the vaccine is its cost . The price could run as much as $80 per shot when administered by a veterinarian , and two or three shots will be needed for full treatment . Norden Laboratories says the high costs are needed to pay for the nearly $2 million that has gone into research for the leukemia vaccine . Still , many people are likely to consider the treatment a bargain if the cat is a champion silver-mackerel tabby worth $2,500 or a $3,000 ruddy-coated Abyssinian . Or just a favorite alley cat .                  @ @ @
