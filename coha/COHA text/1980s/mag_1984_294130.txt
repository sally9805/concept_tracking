When asked whether he had referred to Jews as " Hymie " and to New York City as " Hymie town , " Jackson said over and over , " I have no recollection . " But at a Manchester synagogue two days before the New Hampshire primary , Jackson finally admitted making the offensive comments . " In private talks we sometimes let our guard down and become thoughtless , " he explained . " It was not in a spirit of meanness , but an off-color remark having no bearing on religion or politics . However innocent and unintended , it was insensitive and wrong . " <P> <P> By that time , Jackson 's moral crusade on behalf of the nation 's have-nots had lost a good deal of its luster .
