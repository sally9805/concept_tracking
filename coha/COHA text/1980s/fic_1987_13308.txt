( RAKING . ) You 're early . PEYTO The farmers leave town by 4:00 . No need to keep the feedstore open . ( HE TRIES TO MAKE HIS WORDS CASUAL . ) SEGWOHI Old Crawford lets you close ? PEYTO He 's gone by noon most days . SEGWOHI ( STILL RAKING . ) How is it with you ? PEYTO I do n't know yet . What 's for supper ? SEGWOHI ( STILL HAS NOT LOOKED AT HIS SON . ) No , Sereh 's still in the shed at her potter 's wheel . PEYTO ( SHAKES HIS HEAD . ) What can I say ? She makes more than I do at the feedstore .

SEGWOHI No , you 're not a Medicine Man . Twice divorced . Once in jail for possession  --  chanting our sacred songs in bars . Playing the saxophone to drunk Indians .

But I do n't hear their spirits  --  SEGWOHI They 're STILL here . LISTEN , Peyto  --  PEYTO YOU listen . I hear nothing but the wind scratching over the hills . The ancestors are gone !

What would I do without you to fight against too ? SEGWOHI Maybe you have a hard time because you 're not going in the right direction . PEYTO No . I 'm going with the current . It 's you who always paddles upstream  --  backwards !  --  in your canoe . For a while , you insisted that I row with you . I remember resenting you . But there was nothing I could do until I got old enough to take off . SEGWOHI You resented me ? PEYTO Yes . When I had to dance beside you at pow wows the way you wanted . When I had to stay with you on the farm and I wanted to be in Arapahoe . SEGWOHI I never thought that about my father . p. 6 PEYTO You 've been buried so long out here , you do n't know what the world 's like .

I waited until I was nearly an old man before you were born .

Maybe what you need is another wife  --  I 'm glad your mother 's in the graveyard so she does n't have to hear this  --  PEYTO My older sister , Reanie , is n't  --  SEGWOHI I do n't want to hear about that  --  PEYTO I 'm going to do what I want ! SEGWOHI And I am SEGWOHI , your father . I brought you into this world  --  PEYTO You raised me to be a man . Not some calf running after you . Let go so I can  --  p. 7 SEGWOHI  --  so you can do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your ghosts , to chant to Brother Buffalo and Brother Bear while I 'm pushed farther into the manure bucket each day . Keep your eyes on the sky , Father . You would n't like what you see when you look where I am . SEGWOHI You 're a spoiled calf  --  PEYTO Yes . That 's what you always say . Keep the lid on , Segwohi . You never talk when you 're in town  --  but the minute you 're on your own land  --  nothing can hold you back  --  SEGWOHI What did your mother and I do that was n't for you , Peyto ? And you grew up to turn your back on our ways  --  PEYTO ( GRABS HIS FATHER BY THE ARM . SEREH WALKS TOWARD THEM . SHE STOPS TO WIPE HER HANDS ON HER APRON . ) I 'm no dreamer . I 'm trying to hold my life together  --  I 'm pulled a hundred ways . My wives and children  --  the feedstore . I ca n't get insurance on my jeep .

John already wants the dirt bike he sees at the hardware store . Ero wo n't talk he 's so shy . His teacher wants to send him for evaluation  --  I ca n't remember where . If Seria has one more ear infection she 'll have to have tubes  --  I still have dreams of how close Little Reanie came to dying  --  and where 's Big Reanie , my sister , who left you ? Is that the way we 'll finally make it with you , Pappa ?  --  when we 're out there with them  --  dead and buried so we ca n't ever say another word to you ? p. 9 SEGWOHI Get off my land ! I wo n't have you talking about them . ( HE TAKES PEYTO BY THE ARM AND PUSHES HIM AWAY . SEREH TRIES TO RESTRAIN SEGWOHI . ) PEYTO Yes , I 'm leaving . See you , Sereh . ( HE EXITS . ) SEREH ( SHE LOOKS HARD AT HER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Segwohi ? We do n't have enough enemies in this world ? You have to make one of your son also ? SEGWOHI How can I have him on my land in peace ? SEREH Because he does n't think like you . I saw you raise him , Brother , and he 's what you made him . Now leave him alone . He 'll be all right . SEGWOHI No , he wo n't . You do n't see things as they are . You hope on nothing . You see rain clouds where there are none . What do you know ? SEREH Ah ! Segwohi . Be careful or your son wo n't be the only one who leaves you this day . SEGWOHI Where else do you have to go , old woman ? Your husband left you long ago . You do nothing but make warped cellars at your potter 's wheel . ( HE RETURNS TO HIS RAKING. ) p. 10 SEREH You 've had someone leave you too  --  ( SHE FOLDS HER ARMS . ) Do n't forget I cook for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . Do you know how many old men would have me ? SEGWOHI I checked last week and there were two . One is a woman beater , and the other just died . SEREH ( SMILES , CYNICALLY . ) Well , I guess I 'm stuck here for a while . But tie my leg to the foot-post on my bed , Segwohi . You drive people away from you . Who knows who will be next ? SEGWOHI I suppose it would be you , Sister , since there 's no one else left . SEREH ( SERIOUS AGAIN . ) Why ca n't you get along with Peyto ? You waited so long for him . You finally adopted a daughter thinking you 'd never have  --  SEGWOHI I do n't want to hear that now . SEREH You and I get angry at one another and make light of it . Why ca n't you do that with Peyto ? SEGWOHI ( SHOWING IMPATIENCE . ) Sereh  --  you 're like an old wife . When are you going to stop telling me what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing what I think you should . You 're too hard on him . SEGWOHI My wife never told me what to do . SEREH What should Peyto do when the Indian way of life is gone for him ? Even you , Segwohi  --  what has happened to your way of life ? Where are the winter counts you used to draw ? I remember how you studied the old recordings of events on buffalo hide  --  the plenty-buffalo-meat winter . The Brave-Bear-killed winter  --  I have some of them in my shed . Make your winter counts again . Draw them on the kitchen wall  --  on the barn . Tattoo the whole farm ! SEGWOHI ( HE QUITS RAKING . ) Our way of life is not gone ! I still hear the ancestors on this land  --  I still hear the rocks hiss in their sweat lodge . But no more winter counts ! No !  --  you sell pots ! Peyto sells chants  --  we do n't make a MARKET of our ways ! There 's not one day I do n't hear the buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't hear them , Segwohi . SEGWOHI You 're a woman . SEREH Watch yourself , Brother . SEGWOHI That 's what we 're here for  --  to remember the old ways . To keep the land holy in our memory . I ca n't make winter counts anymore , Sereh  --  one night the grandchildren were here with Peyto  --  they had the television on  --  and the light from the screen flicked across their faces like war-paint  --  I could n't stand it . I want to keep the past  --  p. 12 SEREH That seems a respectable occupation to me . But you ca n't expect everyone to have the same job . SEGWOHI I expect it of my son ! He should be a Holy Man too ! SEREH ( SHE SPITS INTO HER APRON SHE 'S SO MAD . ) He is a Holy Man , Segwohi . SEGWOHI I have n't seen it in him  --  SEREH You keep him away  --  you 'd feel better about HIM and YOURSELF if you DID something . Get out your books again . Draw your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SEREH What else are we here for ? I sit at my wheel with the little storm shelters  --  teapots and cups like small cellars . I made the lid on one teapot like a humped roof  --  the air hole is the little vent  --  the spout is the cellar stairs . SEGWOHI Is that what makes them come out here to buy your pottery ? Making a big hubub of dust in the air ? SEREH I suppose it is . They call me , Storms , Ltd . SEGWOHI They are n't far wrong there . SEREH When I was a girl I used to go down the cellar steps into the ground and sit there by myself . ( THEY SIT ON THE STEPS OF THE FARMHOUSE . ) It was a sanctuary in the earth  --  a dark place where I could feel by myself . You , Segwohi , were off hunting or dancing in the ceremonial ring  --  but I lived in myself  --  p. 13 SEGWOHI ( SHAKES HIS HEAD . ) Teapots like cellars ? SEREH I always feel the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small ravines  --  how I love the clay in my hands . I love the sweet shapes that come from it . ( SEREH 'S FOOT PUMPS AS THOUGH SHE WERE AT HER WHEEL AND HER HANDS MOLDED A CLAY BOWL AS SHE TALKS . ) Hi yey hi yey . ( SHE HUMS . ) SEGWOHI And now I 'm hungry . SEREH About the time I want to go back to my potter 's wheel  --  then you 're hungry ! Why do n't you find one of those buffalo you 're always talking about ? Get out your bow and arrow . Your trusty horse . Remember , Segwohi , they pass by here all the time . I 'll make you buffalo stew when you ride home with the meat . ( SHE LAUGHS BUT SEES THAT HE DOES N'T . SERIOUS THEN  --  ) It wo n't take long to get supper . I 'm warming the cornbread and beans we had last night . I 'm in the middle of new forms . I 'm sorry , brother , I ca n't think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEGWOHI I want supper . SEREH You 're the spoiled calf , Segwohi. p. 14 SEGWOHI Do you always listen to the conversations between my son and me ? SEREH How can I NOT hear you beller at him ! ( SEGWOHI RISES FROM THE STEPS AND SEREH FOLLOWS HIM INTO THE HOUSE . SHE HUMS AGAIN AS SHE MOVES ABOUT THE KITCHEN . SEGWOHI SITS IN A CHAIR AT THE TABLE . ) I feel these invisible shapes in my head . With my hands I form their formlessness in the dark  --  push them out onto my wheel  --  teapot , cups , pitchers , plates , like warped wagon wheels of our people migrating to the next world after our defeat . Everything tries to pull me back into the darkness in my head . Segwohi and my loneliness on the prairie . The hollowness of my old age that is coming . The routine of living . In my work , I feel like I 'm shaping myself  --  those dark forms in my head are my fears and apprehensions . I work them into form  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's such pleasure here alone . I feel the wet clay taking form  --  the form I dictate . I create my pots , sometimes with my thumb a little heavy on one side . I make the lopsided bowls I love to make . With a twig I make a totem of some sort . This secret language of markings on my pots is the twine that holds me together . My life is bound up in my work . It 's my pow wow dance . My sweat lodge ceremony . It 's where I find soothing . It 's where I am whole . Hi yey hi yey  --  come little wire hoops and edging tools  --  my calipers  --  my dear bones and sticks to mark my pots . p. 15 SEGWOHI ( SEGWOHI IS IMPATIENT . ) How long are you going to cackle ? When is my supper going to be warm ? SEREH ( SIGHS . ) I knew it would be you or Peyto to interrupt my peace . SEGWOHI Peyto stomped off  --  SEREH Peyto did n't leave . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIS FINGER IN HIS EAR . ) Am I going deaf ? Is that it too ? ( HE LOOKS TO THE SKY . ) Has he been out in the jeep all this time ? What 's wrong with him ? SEREH Why do n't you ask him sometimes , Segwohi , without putting an answer into his mouth  --  or a judgement into yours . ( SEGWOHI LEAVES SEREH IN THE KITCHEN AND FINDS PEYTO IN HIS JEEP . SEREH WARMS THE SUPPER . ) SEGWOHI Are you still here Son ? PEYTO I do n't have gas to leave and come back . I do n't have money to eat . My first wife needed grocery money . Tomorrow it will be my second  --  or a friend will say I owe an old debt , or Crawford will withhold more of my pay at the feedstore . I do n't know , Segwohi  --  ( PEYTO RESTS HIS HEAD ON HIS ARMS . ) I ca n't be like you , Segwohi . You 're like a Grandfather  --  unbending in the old ways  --  p. 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count maker  --  PEYTO You do n't make anything anymore  --  but war  --  SEGWOHI We 're here to obey the Spirit  --  PEYTO We 're here to make our own way on this open prairie  --  we 're supposed to stand while being pulled one way and then another  --  the job , the white world , the Indian 's . I 'm ordered around by everyone  --  do this . Do that . My wives nag and curse . Where is the peace you talk about ? I do n't know where I 'm going  --  but I know it 's not back here on the old place  --  buried in my thought of what was while the world goes on  --  sometimes I just hang on  --  nothing more . I do n't hear the voices of the ancestors . I ca n't live what I do n't see . I have to take part in the struggle I see before me . It 's the real world , though it 's only fragments of several worlds  --  and hopeless most of the time  --  SEGWOHI It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors , Peyto . You ca n't hear them when you stay at the bar in town every night . PEYTO I have to have a guide who moves in THIS world  --  the one I see . You do n't really hear me  --  ( HE FOLLOWS SEGWOHI BACK TO THE HOUSE. ) p. 17 SEGWOHI I have always heard you  --  since you were a small boy crying because you stepped on a caterpillar or because your mother got after you when you bothered the hens . PEYTO That 's not the hearing I 'm talking about . SEGWOHI Then I grieved all those years you were with Mashunkashey and Bear Track . The jazz band  --  Bear Tracks ! Indian jazz . The sound of the sacred chants of our people on stage  --  in bars  --  in gymnasiums ! ( SEREH STANDS IN THE DOOR . ) PEYTO Well , we did n't get too far . SEGWOHI No , you wrecked your van and served six months for poss  --  PEYTO ( QUICKLY INTERRUPTING . ) You never forgive either . ( HE THUMPS HIS HAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You are just as lost in your spirit as Mashunkashey and Bear Track and I were in our jazz . So we had a wreck . So there was some grass  --  so we did n't do things right , but YOU , Segwohi , are the real JAZZ MAN . You only hear your own music . You 're not open to communication . On your death bed , when the two of us are supposed to become one , and your spirit passes into me to carry on , you 'll look up at me and say you wrecked the van and served six months. Then you 'll die and your spirit will pass into me to carry on your tradition of judgement . Then I can look at my sons and say , You are not doing things right . Here is the sacred , BROKEN hoop of our nation . See how high you can jump into it. ( PEYTO STARTS TO LEAVE THE YARD AGAIN  --  SEGWOHI TRIES TO PUT HIS HAND ON PEYTO 'S SHOULDER , BUT PEYTO REFUSES IT . ) Goodbye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOWN THE ROAD. ) p. 18 SEGWOHI ( HE STANDS IN THE YARD A MOMENT . LOOKS TO THE SKY . ) A flock of geese rising over the silo  --  ( HE PULLS HIS COLLAR UP AROUND HIS NECK . HE SEES SEREH STANDING IN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE. ) @x ( SEREH , PEYTO AND SEGWOHI AT THE SUPPER TABLE . SEGWOHI EATS WITHOUT LOOKING UP FROM HIS PLATE . ) SEREH I watch the asphodel from the window as I cook . When I look across the prairie they 're like candles in the aisle of the Indian church . I see the far end of life when I look from the west window this time of evening . PEYTO How do you see the far end ? No one knows that . SEREH I know someday I 'll be an old lady still molding clay . My hands will not realize they 're working alone . I 'll stare off into space where my trail soon leads , but my fingers will still shape a bowl as though I were at my wheel . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could press the asphodel blossoms into my clay for patterns . PEYTO ( HE ENJOYS TEASING HIS AUNT . ) Segwohi talks sometimes about his death  --  are you becoming like him ? SEREH Segwohi always talks . SEGWOHI I hear my name . SEREH He 's absent from himself when he eats . SEGWOHI Supper is for eating , not talking . ( HE LOOKS UP FROM THE TABLE . ) Soon the stars will be out like the white beans Sereh spilled on the floor . p. 20 SEREH Northern beans  --  when I was putting them to soak . Do n't you like them with ham ? SEGWOHI Yes , but not when they 've been on the floor . SEREH They were still hard  --  had n't been cooked . You have n't been sick yet . SEGWOHI I 'm a Medicine Man . Only because the sweat lodge keeps me well . SEREH You 're the puggmill grinding up my clay , Segwohi . You  --  whose name means , Two become together one  --  need a new name . You should have seen us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Furnas County to dig more clay . The truck got stuck in the mud and he churned it back and forth , grunting and chanting . I had my shawl over my face as though I was praying to the Great Spirit to push us , but I was holding my laughter in my head . I could n't let it out , not in front of Segwohi , who does n't laugh . SEGWOHI Especially when I 'm stuck in the mud and might have to pay a tow truck  --  PEYTO And walk five miles to a farmhouse to call one . SEGWOHI And then , Peyto , Sereh makes a war cry  --  a tremolo  --  ( PEYTO LOOKS AT SEREH AND LAUGHS . ) Next time , Peyto , you take Sereh for clay . You get your new jeep muddy . p. 21 SEREH Well , we got out of the mud , did n't we ? Segwohi put rocks in the mud in front of the wheels  --  and we rocked the truck  --  me at the gas pedal  --  him pushing and rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back to Arapahoe , the truck was steaming . In all our snorting and spirit-dancing on the old road , we 'd thrown a pebble through the radiator . So Segwohi and I sat there at the garage while they repaired the radiator . It cost him some money after all  --  SEGWOHI But Sereh had her bucket of Nebraska clay , and a few hairs from a dead skunk for her brushes  --  and she got to watch the sky . SEREH The way the reds flowed into one another  --  ( SEREH CARRIES THE PLATES TO THE SINK AND GETS A BILL FROM THE SUGAR BOWL . SHE PASSES IT TO PEYTO AS SHE POURS MORE COFFEE FOR THE MEN . ) SEGWOHI She said over and over , san dah bouah  --  san dah bouah. SEREH Sange de boeuf . It means blood of the cow . It 's the bright red I get by shutting off the air in my firebrick kiln . I knew that evening I would work in red for my next firing . The clouds were so gorgeous , Peyto . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Except Segwohi  --  who would think he might get caught in a downdraft and it would cost him something . p. 22 SEGWOHI ( CHANGING THE SUBJECT . ) You should see the vessels Sereh has just fired . SEREH Are n't they lovely ? I molded some new shapes  --  they 're almost like dreams . I want them on the table in the morning to see if they carry what I feel in the night . This particular teapot , Segwohi  --  you like it ? SEGWOHI Yes , a man 's head . The ear a handle ? SEREH It 's you , Segwohi . ( PEYTO LAUGHS . ) SEGWOHI Ah yes . That 's why I 'm here . To give you two something to laugh about . ( HE WALKS TO THE WINDOW . ) I 'll tell you who laughs . The pirates  --  ( NODS HIS HEAD TOWARD THE ROAD . ) The pirates  --  the renegades  --  whoever drives around the country putting buckshot in the roadsigns and my mailbox ! There are more holes in it today . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you , Peyto  --  going the other way  --  I 'm going to keep a watch for that old green pickup  --  the mail gets wet when it rains  --  or snows  --  PEYTO It 's no one I know . SEGWOHI Do you mean you 've never done it ? p. 23 PEYTO Not since I was sixteen . SEGWOHI Bear Track ? Mashunk  --  PEYTO ( INTERRUPTS HIS FATHER . ) We 're men ! I 'm over thirty years old and you treat me like I was a boy taking potshots at fenceposts . SEGWOHI Well  --  PEYTO I 'll never have a chance with you . I was glad to see you coming down the road after me  --  my jeep 's out of gas . But then our trouble starts again  --  why do n't you hide in the bushes all night with your cannon ? ( HE TURNS TO SEREH , HUGS HER . AS HE LEAVES , HE TURNS TO SEGWOHI ONCE MORE . ) Why do n't you bring down the wrath of the Great Spirit on us all ? ( PEYTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to borrow your gas can so I can get back to town . Is there gas in it ? SEGWOHI There always is  --  ( PEYTO SLAMS THE DOOR AGAIN . ) SEREH ( FINGERS HER TEAPOTS ON THE TABLE. ) @x ( THE NEXT MORNING . SEREH AND SEGWOHI ARE AT THE TABLE . ) SEREH I had a dream , Segwohi . ( SEREH FINGERS A TEAPOT ON THE TABLE AGAIN . ) SEGWOHI I guess I 'm going to hear it . SEREH We lived in a rambling house . Not this one here  --  not this little one . ( SEGWOHI LOOKS AT HER . ) Though I 'm fond of the curled-up linoleum  --  ( SHE LOOKS AT THE ROOM. )  --  the egg-scale and wooden utinsels hanging on the wall  --  the pile of newspapers , this sturdy walnut table . SEGWOHI Ummph  --  ( HE GOES ON EATING , THOUGH HIS FACE SHOWS THE INSULT THAT HIS SISTER THINKS HIS HOUSE IS SMALL . AS SEREH RELATES HER DREAM TO HIM , SEGWOHI GOES ON EATING  --  SOMETIMES AS THOUGH HE DOES N'T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEAD CLOSE TO HIS PLATE  --  FORGETTING TO WIPE HIS CHIN FOR A MOMENT WHERE SOME EGG HAS FALLEN . AS SEREH TALKS , SHE WIPES THE PLACE ON HER CHIN WHERE HE HAS EGG , AND HE WIPES HIS FACE WITH HIS NAPKIN . ) SEREH No . The house in my dream was a large one with several stories and rooms here and there  --  ( SHE LIFTS HER ARM TO THE LEFT AND THEN THE RIGHT . ) With several floors in each wing  --  ( SHE MOVES HER HAND IN THE SPACE UNDER THE ARM SHE HOLDS OUT . ) I sat in the backyard looking at it . And the top story , Segwohi , was a wagon . Yes , whoever built the house , had raised a wagon to be the cupola  --  the top of the house . You know , the lower floors were vast , but the upper ones got smaller , until the one on top was a small sleeping room you see on some old house . There was a window in it , and a roof over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a moment , I saw that the small room was a wagon  --  the kind the settlers came in . Then I walked around inside the house . Cleaning it . Sweeping . And there was Peyto in one of the wings of the house  --  in his room . And he was on the floor . I came to him , sweeping , and he wanted me to stop . I leaned down and held him , the way a mother holds her small child . He said he heard the spirits . They were ringing a bell to bring in the pigs . ( SHE PUTS HER HAND TO HER MOUTH LAUGHING . ) As though a pig would come to the ring of a bell . It 's as though the house were an old slaughter house . Yes , that 's what it was  --  my husband worked there at one time . And Segwohi , Peyto was crying alone . Telling me what he heard  --  these ghosts and old battles and the slaughter of our lives on the plains . And we are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought our end . And we are like cattle and pigs going to the slaughter  --  that must be changed , Segwohi . I want to go to Peyto and hold him . His own father wo n't have anything to do with him . He has inherited your ability to see what 's not here . As though what were here alone was n't enough , you have to bring in the past . It sits over your house . Yes , Segwohi , I see you 're a Medicine Man . I see your house out here on this isolated land  --  it 's more than I thought it was . I see how you live  --  and I saw in my dream that Peyto is a seer like you  --  I think I understand you both more now . p. 25 SEGWOHI The Spirits visit a woman in such a way ? SEREH Oh , what will happen next ? The Spirit comes so low to visit me in my sleep ? Me ! Sereh ? The one who has been with you your whole life . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , only five years later . But never worthy to be loved by you  --  only here to serve . I am glad the Great Spirit does n't see as you do . Oh we are all relieved at that . The animals each day , wipe their brows . Oh relief ! The Spirit is not as Segwohi is . Oh no , we are humble creatures . Only Segwohi stands on this earth next to God . You can sit in that chair eating your toast  --  with crumbs on your shirt  --  and you do n't know that God loves me too ? I am not just your after-birth , Jazz Man ! SEGWOHI Sereh ! ( HE LOOKS AT THE CEILING AND DOES NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO . ) Why do I need my sister telling me my faults ? Am I like that darkened place over the woodstove ? Or that place where the paint is peeling around the leak ? I love Peyto  --  but ca n't show  --  SEREH Why not ? He sees like you do . Only he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spirits say . I heard them from his mouth in my dream . I held him with my Spirit . I talked to him  --  that 's where the battle of our lives is now  --  shaking off the past  --  the defeats  --  or at least confining them with our art  --  your winter counts , Segwohi , that you do n't make anymore  --  ( SHE LOOKS AT THE WINDOW AND SHIVERS . SHE PULLS HER SHAWL UP AROUND HER SHOULDERS AS THOUGH FEELING THE VAST EXPANSE OF LAND THROUGH THE WINDOW . ) No  --  Segwohi is above art  --  what a pious snake you are . If you were in my yard I 'd step on you and squash your insides out . I 'd drown you in the downpour we have once a year when the creek runs out of it banks like you do ALL the time , Segwohi ! And I 'd feed your soggy remains to the vultures . p. 26 SEGWOHI So I do n't sit too high with you this morning , eh , Sereh ? SEREH I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLEARS AWAY SEGWOHI 'S PLATE AND FLATWARE . ) Now shut up ! My nephew is in need of a father and you babble to the buffalo , the bear and wolf  --  you talk to the wind more than you do your own son . You look down on us because we make commerce of our art . ( SHE POURS HIM SOME COFFEE . ) I want something from you too , Segwohi  --  gratitude , I guess . I 've cooked for you ten years since your wife 's death . I earn enough from my pottery that I could live by myself . You took care of me in the past , but now I make the money that pays the taxes on your land and buys the food . ( SHE SITS AT THE TABLE AGAIN . ) The women come from Sante Fe and pay me a lot for my pottery . I buy a firebrick kiln . I give some of the money to the orphans  --  to Peyto . It costs a lot for two wives and five children . I 'll probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardware . I 'll pay for Ero 's counseling . ( SHE SMOOTHS OUT HER SKIRT . ) I buy this silver belt  --  this shawl woven from fine yarns . I outbid everyone at the auction for a few more hens . I give some to YOU , Segwohi . So now I have spent it all  --  I can say I 'm poor again and have to live with you . It 's better than living with myself  --  letting the men come around again  --  though I 'm getting too old for that anymore . At least you spare me some of my troubles . p. 27 SEGWOHI I do n't remind you of your past  --  SEREH How generous . But why Peyto ? SEGWOHI I want him to be a Holy Man . SEREH And I do n't count ?  --  SEGWOHI I do n't blame you for Peyto  --  his wildness . ( SEREH HITS THE TABLE IN ANGER . ) But you recovered yourself . ( SEGWOHI TRIES TO CALM HER . ) Maybe Peyto  --  ( SHE JERKS AWAY FROM HIM , WHICH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your expensive shawl over your shoulders , potting your square horse-troughs and coffins ! ( NOW SEGWOHI HITS THE TABLE . SEREH REACHES TO PROTECT HER POTTERY . ) Pschano ! Here is Sereh , working in her shed  --  ( HIS ARMS ARE UP IN THE AIR. )  --  Working with her pots as though they were Spirits . Telling Segwohi what to do . She is on her toes reaching high into the sky  --  ( HE MAKES CHIRPING NOISES . ) She is almost one of the crows that fly over with her black hair and beak  --  trying for things too high for her . SEREH And there 's the old chickenhawk , Segwohi . Stealing our happiness as though it were little chicks in the barnyard with Solomon and his hens . No laughing here , not on Segwohi 's land . It is sacred territory ! We must all be somber . We must look down on everyone who is not exactly like us. p. 28 SEGWOHI That 's enough , Sereh . Go live in town if you want . Leave me here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I will pot my bowls and teapots right out there in MY shed until I 'm a hollow old woman , my mind hopping in the field with the rabbits , my hands still shaping clay . ( ANGRILY . ) Hollow vessels . Where is my life ? I need kindness , Segwohi . I have always felt your scorn . Who do you think you are , Medicine Man ? Inheritor of the earth and the happy hunting grounds ? So much above us you do n't stoop to anything as low as us  --  SEGWOHI Pshano ! ( HE BANGS HIS HAND ON THE TABLE AND LEAVES THE KITCHEN IN ANGER . ) SEREH ( SHE RUSHES AFTER HIM . ) I bore a grudge against my husband for years . It polluted everything I did  --  even the clay . I still make cellars  --  and you are right ! They are coffins . They 're so small , you hardly know  --  but they 're coffins . I see them as cries of anger . And the dead world rushes to them . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Segwohi , who do nothing but farm and stand out under the clouds and speak to the Spirits  --  the world has no use for you ! SEGWOHI ( THEY STAND OUTSIDE A MOMENT NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO . SEREH PULLS THE SHAWL TIGHTLY ABOUT HER . SHE STILL WEARS HER APRON . ONCE SHE PUTS HER HAND ON SEGWOHI 'S ARM , BUT HE PULLS AWAY . HE LOOKS AT THE SKY AS HE TALKS . ) I 'm not worthy of making winter counts . I 'm not worthy of recording our events . That 's why I stopped  --  I see Solomon and his hens . Ki-Ye , your cat , stalking the weeds  --  the V-formation of the geese and the V of the one-horse hand-plow leaning against the barn . The wind blows the hedge-grass by the fence and the cornstalks in the field . It is all Holy . How can I touch it ? p. 29 SEREH What do you know about being unworthy ? My husband did n't want me . The Great Spirit did n't give me children . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move toward death  --  to grow old as a Grandmother and be left helpless against everything  --  that 's all I can do against it  --  make pots ! What is that ? To know my skin wrinkles and my veins stand up like a beaver dam about to burst ? I married a man once just to have someplace to go . Now I stay with you  --  I want to be loved . SEGWOHI I do love you , Sereh . You 're my sister who has always been with me  --  longer than my wife and daughter . You are with me even more than Peyto . I think he would not even come out here but for you . SEREH He likes my beans and cornbread . SEGWOHI He likes the peace you bring between us . The money you give him . Even the grandchildren run to you first . You 've have always been the peacemaker , and I , Segwohi , Medicine Man , whose job it is to make peace , have been the one who kept the land plowed up so nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I do n't make winter counts  --  SEREH Do n't pound yourself . Living does enough of that . SEGWOHI From the beginning of my life you have been an example of how to act . ( SHE LOOKS AWAY FROM HIM . ) Even when you went with one man or another , the spirit of gentleness , kindness and forgiveness was always with you  --  held up for me to see what I could not attain . I 've never recognized you as the person you are . I hear your sighs in the sweat lodge . I know the anguish in your head . I see it in your little coffins that you spin on your wheel . And I always thought , well , she 's a woman . What does it matter ? But I see you as a person , sister . Not just someone following me from the cemetery after our mother and father 's death  --  after my daughter and wife 's  --  But you are someone with significance .

THEN HE LOOKS AT SEREH . ) I have to ask you something , Sereh. p. 30 SEREH What is it ? SEGWOHI Did I make my wife  --  feel angry  --  SEREH She thought it was an honor to be married to a Medicine Man , Segwohi . I do n't know why  --  SEGWOHI Thank you , Sister . ( SHE NODS AT HIM . HE SITS DOWN AGAIN. ) @x ( ANOTHER MORNING IN THE KITCHEN . PEYTO ENTERS . ) SEGWOHI Ah , Peyto 's day off ? PEYTO I may have to borrow your truck , Segwohi , to help my first wife move . Her rent went up and she cursed at the landlord . I think she broke a window . Now he wants her out . SEREH Sit down , Peyto . It 's always something with you . What are those children hearing ? PEYTO Mashunkashey put a dent in Old Crawford 's hardware truck . He wo n't let me borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a while . You would n't have your friends causing you trouble  --  bring the children  --  PEYTO I want my friends , Segwohi . ( HE LOOKS AROUND THE ROOM , HUGS HIMSELF SUDDENLY . ) I remember the cold bedroom and frontroom here  --  I always shivered getting dressed . But in the kitchen when Mother had the stove on and the oatmeal cooking , the windows steamed up and it was hot as a summer afternoon . Then I 'd sweat . I was always either hot or cold . I do n't remember just ordinary days you never noticed  --  no , the weather was an enemy  --  p. 32 SEGWOHI That 's what it 's here for  --  endurance . We must be strong . ( SEREH SHRUGS HER SHOULDERS AND LOOKS TO THE CEILING . ) PEYTO How do you stand it here with him ? It 's enough for me to come out on my day off  --  just to see if there 's anything that needs to be done  --  SEGWOHI And to ask for something  --  SEREH I 'm glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole place would fall down otherwise . ( SHE SHIVERS . ) Burrrrr  --  I 'll have to get out the heating pad again for Ki-Ye , my old cat . Now that it 's getting cold her rheumatism will bother her . SEGWOHI If I had someone petting me all the time , I would purr too . PEYTO I thought I heard a chant in the wind . It sounds like a sax  --  ( HE STANDS AT THE WINDOW . ) SEREH Hold on to your jazz , Peyto , if only in your head . That 's where my pottery was for years . SEGWOHI Yes , encourage him , Sereh . It 's like being outbid by you at the auction in Arapahoe . SEREH ( SMILES . ) You still remember that ? p. 33 SEGWOHI Yes , Sereh and her pottery-money  --  PEYTO What shapes you come up with , Sereh ! ( HE SITS AT THE TABLE AGAIN . ) SEREH No , you do n't see them on the shelves in the hardware store  --  SEGWOHI Nor anywhere else in Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They look lovely in Sante Fe  --  that 's the best thing my second husband did for me  --  he took me there on our honeymoon and I saw the markets  --  afterwards , I sent them some of my things . PEYTO Why do n't you live there ? SEREH I ca n't work in Sante Fe . I do n't have the feel for prairie there that I need for potting . The cellars  --  the wind storms  --  PEYTO Segwohi taunting you . SEREH Yes , tension is a part of it  --  SEGWOHI Clean up the kitchen , Sereh . All these newspapers  --  what a place . I need to go to the barn . You can borrow my truck whenever you want , Peyto . SEREH I need the papers when I wrap my pottery for shipping  --  I told you that . ( SEGWOHI STANDS . ) I know you go to the grave first . You leave me here wondering why there has never been anyone for me . I keep thinking someday a man will drive up . Or I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be waiting . It 's too late for me to have children . Peyto is like my son anyway , and his children are my grandchildren . Segwohi will have to drive me to town so I can see them again . Maybe they can come out for an afternoon . When they 're here I feel like the hen in the barnyard with all her chicks . But I still would like a husband to love . I see Segwohi at his wife 's grave and think , why have I missed this ? Did the man die whom I should have loved ? Why am I left with only my pots ? p. 34 PEYTO You were married once . SEREH I was married twice  --  almost several other times too  --  but it did n't last . You should understand that , Peyto . PEYTO I still see my wives . They 're a part of me . Sometimes I wish they were n't . If I moved out here , Sereh , I would bring the children . The wives want me to take them off their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sereh would watch them . SEREH You want me to take care of five children ? PEYTO Well  --  just for the summer . SEREH I ca n't  --  ( SHE GETS UP FROM THE TABLE AND STANDS AT THE WINDOW BESIDE SEGWOHI . ) Maybe if your daughter , Reanie , were here to help . You know she always had a child on her lap  --  at the pow wow  --  wherever . But how could I work with five children running through my shed ? SEGWOHI ( HESITATES . ) Maybe Sereh 's busy with her pots  --  PEYTO You mean she 's busy taking care of you ! SEGWOHI You tell me your pots obey you , Sereh . But give them a will of their own  --  p. 35 SEREH I do what I can to help you , Peyto  --  but  --  SEGWOHI We always do what we can to help  --  PEYTO ( ANGRILY . ) The best thing you could do is die and leave me your land . ( PEYTO TURNS AWAY , EMBARRASSED HE SAID WHAT HE DID . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke your grass  --  get DRUNK with your friends  --  let THEM help you . ( SEREH BACKS AWAY FROM SEGWOHI . ) Do you know how I felt in court  --  all the way to Omaha to hear your trial ? It was the SHAME of the Ancestors ! PEYTO ( RISING . ) Are they still here with us ? Maybe we could make a chart on the wall  --  like the old drawings on teepee-hides telling of the loss of game  --  or the cavalry raids  --  ( HE POINTS TO THE WALL . ) Forget your winter counts , Segwohi . Make teepee drawings . Of course , they 'd all be of Peyto 's downfall and trial . His failures  --  all according to Segwohi , of course . SEGWOHI Ah , that 's what I 'll do ! Give me a grease pencil , Sereh  --  the ones you mark your pots with  --  p. 36 SEREH They 're in the shed . SEGWOHI I 'll go get one . ( HE QUICKLY LEAVES THE KITCHEN . ) PEYTO ( HE PACES IN ANGER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone like Segwohi ? I do n't know how you stand it here with him . No , I wo n't move in with you  --  as much as I could do without rent . SEREH I ca n't take care of five children anyway  --  as much as they need it . PEYTO Why ? SEREH I do n't have patience , for one thing . For another  --  my life has always felt separated  --  but now I 'm becoming one with my work . PEYTO You 'd have patience . SEREH No , Peyto . You messed up your life . You and your wives take care of your children . PEYTO You always help me . SEREH Not this time . PEYTO All right , Sereh  --  ( ANGRILY . ) I could n't stay with Segwohi anyway . I waited to leave here too many years  --  SEREH Be patient with him , Peyto  --  p. 37 PEYTO No ! ( HE POUNDS THE TABLE . ) SEGWOHI ( HE RUSHES BACK INTO THE KITCHEN HOLDING A GREASE PENCIL . ) It was right on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SEGWOHI That 's just what I need . A buffalo-hide drawing  --  a wall-drawing of Peyto 's antics . So when he proclaims his goodness to me , I can show him what he 's done . From MY viewpoint , of course , as though I were making all this up  --  SEREH No , Brother , you 're going too far . SEGWOHI Yes , Sereh . I should be as daring as Peyto . I should use my art ! I 'm not outbid on this ! Let 's see . Peyto was born . ( SEGWOHI MAKES A DRAWING OF A PAPOOSE . ) Right here on the wall  --  under the shelf , by the open scissors on a hook  --  I draw a papoose . You never keep the kitchen clean as my wife did anyway , Sereh . What will a few marks matter ? ( HE THINKS A MOMENT . ) Peyto grows . ( SEGWOHI DRAWS A BOW AND ARROW . ) A Christmas present when he was a boy . Now Peyto is a bigger boy  --  stealing the pumpkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to school unless I took him to the door  --  ( SEGWOHI DRAWS A PUMPKIN AND SCARECROW . PEYTO SITS AT THE TABLE WITH HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS. ) p. 38 SEREH ( SEREH TOUCHES HER NEPHEW TO COMFORT HIM  --  WHILE SHE FROWNS AT SEGWOHI . ) Are you going to draw my short comings too ? SEGWOHI Would there be room ? ( HE STARTS TO DRAW BARS )  --  Peyto in jail  --  PEYTO Would there be room for yours ? That 's the question . Your meanness  --  your unforgiveness . SEREH You 're self-righteousness , Brother . Do n't you ever learn ? SEGWOHI I could make my wall-drawings in the underpass on the way to town  --  everytime I go to Arapahoe , I see someone else has written something  --  do you see this black square and white circle ? ( HE DRAWS. )  --  that 's the underpass . ( HE SCRIBBLES OVER IT . ) Is n't that what you both do when you sell your pottery in the market , and sing your bear-hunting songs in bars ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . What would you know , you snake ? SEGWOHI  --  No , no  --  I mark it closed so no one else can leave me . I 've lost enough  --  I 'm such an old rattler  --  p. 39 SEREH Enough , Segwohi . You 'll cause us to rip one another up . PEYTO No , it will be only him . SEGWOHI It is better to let Peyto rip me up without letting him know how it hurts ? PEYTO I ca n't stand this , Sereh . He drives me away . SEGWOHI Ah , you should stay , Peyto , and see what your winter count looks like on the wall . PEYTO Have I died ? Do I stand now in judgement , seeing my life pass before me ? And where are the good things I have done , Father . Are n't I here now to fix the barn door ? I lived on this land for years with you and received only your scorn . SEGWOHI Go back to Arapahoe . To whatever woman you 've got there . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any more grandchildren for me ? ( SEGWOHI STARTS TO DRAW THE CHILDREN . ) PEYTO ( PICKS UP THE SALT SHAKER AND THROWS IT AT THE WALL . ) You always back me into a corner ! ( HE THROWS A PLATE AT THE DRAWINGS , THEN REACHES FOR ONE OF THE BOWLS . ) SEREH No  --  Peyto ! ( HE THROWS IT ANYWAY . ) Leave before you hurt him . Leave before I hurt you ! ( SHE THROWS HIS JEAN JACKET AT HIM . SHOVES HIM TO THE DOOR ANGRILY . LOOKS AT THE PIECES OF THE BOWL PEYTO THREW AGAINST THE WALL . ) I liked the blue in this bowl . It was the sky through the chestnut tree in the yard . p. 40 SEGWOHI I 'll draw Peyto throwing bowls  --  ( HE STARTS TO DRAW . ) SEREH ( SHE TURNS ON SEGWOHI . ) Stop that drawing ! What 's wrong with you ? DEVIL ! You 're no Medicine Man . You 're a hateful old INCITER . ( SHE IS SO ANGRY , SHE NEARLY SPITS AS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . ( SHE GRABS THE GREASE PENCIL FROM SEGWOHI . ) If Segwohi can make his chart , then I can make mine ! Now , I work in the kitchen cooking suppers . I have cooked for ten years  --  one supper each day makes 3,650 suppers . ( SHE FIGURES THIS OUT ON THE WALL . SEGWOHI STARES AT HER . ) No wonder I feel like I 'm always busy . Of course , there 's lunch and breakfast for Segwohi too . I wonder if I can figure all this . SEGWOHI You were always good in math . SEREH Jam be coup ! I 'll try . ( SEREH IS QUIET A MOMENT AS SHE FIGURES ON THE WALL . ) Holy buffalo . That 's 7,300 meals I 've cooked for Segwohi . Now say we live twenty more years  --  three meals each day  --  ( SEREH FIGURES FOR ANOTHER MOMENT . ) That 's 21,900 meals I still have to cook ! p. 41 SEGWOHI Maybe you wo n't be here that long . SEREH ( IGNORING HIM . ) Now sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I 'll take one meal off for twenty years  --  that makes only 21,980 more times I have to cook . ( SEGWOHI TRIES TO TAKE THE PENCIL BACK . ) Just a moment , Sehwohi . I have to catch up on the first ten years I 've served in this place . ( SHE BEGINS MARKING THE WALL BEHIND THE STOVE FURIOUSLY WITH TINY ROMAN NUMERALS . SEGWOHI CAN ONLY STAND AND WATCH. ) @x ( SEREH AND SEGWOHI AT THE KITCHEN TABLE . SEREH READS THE NEWSPAPER , FOLDS IT SUDDENLY AND LOOKS AT SEGWOHI . ) SEGWOHI You 've had another dream ? My small house and a larger one with a covered wagon sitting on it ? That 's why you ca n't help Peyto . You 're busy with your dreams  --  your little children from the Dream Talker . SEREH No dream , Segwohi . This is straight from the head while I 'm awake . Everything seems against Peyto . SEGWOHI Well , he 's got his Aunt Mamma he comes to see . SEREH Why ca n't you just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought about Reanie too  --  and I thought about you , Segwohi . SEGWOHI I do n't dream about her so much anymore . Maybe she 's with the Ancestors  --  SEREH I think she 's alive . She 's unhappy wherever she is . She might come back sometime , Segwohi . Would you be understanding ? I remember my dream when I thought this earth was a slaughter house  --  one like those that line up on the way to Omaha . She feels it too . p. 43 SEGWOHI Maybe she 'll come back and help Segwohi with his children . Maybe she 'll come back and have some grandsons for me . Maybe before I die , I 'll know who will take my place . SEREH Maybe our strength will come in a new way . Through Peyto  --  SEGWOHI Diluted ? SEREH No  --  that 's only in your mind , Segwohi . Peyto can be a Holy Man . I see it in my sleep when everything is as it should be . Or maybe the Two becoming one will be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEGWOHI Not on this earth . SEREH I remind you of one of our Cherokee legends  --  from the Ancestors  --  One day in the old times , when we could talk to the animals , while some children were playing outside their house , their mother inside heard them scream . Running out she found a rattlesnake had crawled from the grass , and taking up a stick , she killed it . The father was out hunting and that evening coming home after dark he heard a strange wailing sound  --  it was the rattlesnakes , with their mouths open crying . He asked them the reason for their trouble , and they told him that his wife had killed their Chief . The snakes told him that now he would have to give his wife as a sacrifice for their chief or something far worse would happen . They told him that a rattlesnake would go with him and coil up outside the door in the dark . He must go inside where he would find his wife waiting , and ask her to get him a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his house and very dark , but he found his wife waiting with his supper ready . He sat down and asked for a drink of water . She handed him the gourd , but he said he wanted it fresh from the spring , so she took a bowl and went out the door . The next moment he heard a cry , and going out he found the rattlesnake had bitten her and she was already dying . He stayed with her until she was dead . Then the rattlesnake came out of the grass again and taught the hunter a prayer song , and said , when you meet any of us , sing this song and we shall not hurt you , but if one of us should bite one of your tribe , then sing this song over him and he will recover. We sing that song to this day , Segwohi . Hanney nah nah no  --  ( SHE WIGGLES HER HAND TOWARD HIM . ) Henado'sihe . Ka'na:ti. p. 44 SEGWOHI ( HE BACKS AWAY FROM HER . ) Now I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who brought the healing in that story . But you could be healing for Peyto  --  a Medicine Dance . Out of our evil comes a song you could give him . You 've closed your windows . You live on your farm with all your hay stored in the barnloft and watch those of us who are struggling  --  and you look down on us . We 're hardly more than part of your landscape at times . Look at that wall  --  that 's Peyto 's flesh you 're marking up . You do it right in front of his eyes . You wound instead of heal , Medicine Man ! Draw your own sins . ( SHE HOLDS A GREASE PENCIL TO HIS FACE . ) No . I will ! I 'm not as blind as you . ( SEREH BEGINS HER OWN WALL DRAWING NEAR THE STOVE WHERE SHE 'S MARKED THE NUMBER OF MEALS SHE 'S COOKED . ) Ho ! I forgot to mark breakfast ! ( SHE MAKES ANOTHER MARK WITH THE OTHERS . THEN SHE DRAWS SEGWOHI . ) Arrows straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how he got so obtuse . SEGWOHI You 're marking up MY kitchen , Sereh . SEREH It 's my kitchen , Brother . What do you do with it except eat with your head in your plate ? p. 45 SEGWOHI What do you ?  --  Always warming and re-warming beans . You 're always wanting ME to do something . But let Peyto bring his children to run through YOUR potting shed  --  SEREH All right , then  --  I 'm marking up YOUR kitchen . But I think we ought to see Segwohi here among the drawings . A square head with window-shades drawn over his eyes . SEGWOHI And here is Sereh  --  just like that crack in the wall  --  who is supposed to keep me from loneliness after the death of my wife . Do n't you know what it 's like to hunger for someone  --  SEREH I ca n't remember anything but the hungering . I thought I 'd told you that . Sometimes I ca n't wait for the night to sleep . And here we are , brother and sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . Separated as we are from the old way of life  --  separated as the Great Spirit and man . SEGWOHI I 'm not separated from God . SEREH Yes , you are . Otherwise you 'd help Peyto . What if we draw you both on the wall and the drawing shows Peyto is braver than you ?  --  he has more to struggle against  --  more of him goes into the struggle . He is moving his first wife . His friends come by with beer . Ero is hiding in the bushes because he 's shy and afraid . Maybe I could take care of him  --  maybe he would sit on my lap while I pot . What about it , Segwohi ? Huh ? Yes , here is Segwohi from another angle . The lightning that struck him on the head is now darting out his eyes at others ! Yes , first of all , it hits his own son . ( SHE DRAWS A STICK FIGURE FOR PEYTO . THE FIGURE WEARS A STRIPED JAIL-SHIRT . ) No , Segwohi . Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cross ? ( SHE EXTENDS THE ARMS OF THE STICK FIGURE AND DRAWS A CROWN OF THORNS ON HIS HEAD . ) Here is Peyto . Suffering for the world which is not worthy of him  --  p. 46 SEGWOHI I do n't know why the Great Spirit does n't strike you . SEREH He 's probably too busy aiming for you . Is that why you put the lightning rod on the barn last spring ? SEGWOHI I did n't want the hay to catch fire . SEREH You did n't want your own pants to catch fire . ( SHE DRAWS A BLACK SQUARE WITH A WHITE CIRCLE IN IT . ) I 've come out of the underpass too . I 've passed a flock of black-birds rising from the field . How I wish I could pot something moving like that . SEGWOHI I want the pencil now . SEREH No ! SEGWOHI Yes ! ( HE TAKES THE PENCIL FROM HER AND SHE SITS AT THE TABLE . ) Here is Segwohi making the sweat lodge , draping hides over the poles . Gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices of the Ancestors as I draw ! Maybe they are happy with my drawings . Here we are with the white man 's wagon for a cupola over us  --  Sereh dreams . Here is my sister who is complete in herself  --  for as long as she stays at her potter 's wheel  --  or in her sleep . Asphodels bloom at her shed . ( HE DRAWS THEM ALSO . ) And now we are in the Sweat Lodge . He ye hey ye . ( SEGWOHI CHANTS AS HE DRAWS . ) Rocks hiss like buckshot into mailboxes and road signs . The holy trail down from the Great Spirit to something shiny as brass  --  what is it ? A sax ? NO ! It ca n't be . Peyto and Bear Tracks  --  his Indian band ? ( SEREH LAUGHS. ) @x ( ANOTHER DAY . SEREH IS IN HER SHED WITH THE PIECES OF THE BOWL PEYTO BROKE . ) SEGWOHI ( ENTERING THE SHED . ) Did you see the clouds in the sky this morning , Sereh ? SEREH Yes  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we fly sometimes in our sleep  --  over the prairie of Furnas County in the airships of our dreams . The wide sky passing under us  --  SEGWOHI What do you think they meant ? SEREH You 're the Medicine Man who has contact with the Spirits and Ghosts of our Ancestors . SEGWOHI I wondered if the clouds were the ghost of my wife . The moon was like a small milkpail beside her . SEREH I do n't know . SEGWOHI Is that the bowl Peyto broke ? SEREH I 'm trying to glue it together . SEGWOHI How can you forgive him ? SEREH Because I 've done things that need forgiving . That 's what we live for , Segwohi . Not to be perfect . No . We live to make mistakes so we can know forgiveness. p. 49 SEGWOHI ( HE PICKS UP A PIECE OF THE BROKEN POTTERY . ) The color of the sky , you say ? SEREH Yes . I 'm going to put it back together . That 's where the struggle of our lives is . Not in shucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Our struggle is living with the broken pieces . We are n't whole . Our family is broken , Segwohi . The hoop of our nation  --  we 're a mix of several bloods . Cheyenne . Cherokee . Who knows what else  --  SEGWOHI You know , Sereh , I think my wife 's happy with the wall-drawings in the kitchen . She was always so careful  --  not even any flour on the counter after she made cornbread or pies  --  ( SMILES . ) Not like you . Sereh  --  you have it all over yourself  --  and are so messy I ca n't stand it sometimes . SEREH I might paint the kitchen after your drawing-spell is over . You have n't let me touch anything since I came here to live  --  SEGWOHI Maybe I 'll keep working with my wall-drawings when you 're off in your shed  --  SEREH If you 're buried in your work , who 'll the women from Sante Fe ogle over when they come , if you 're busy drawing on the kitchen wall ? p. 50 SEGWOHI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight . SEREH ( SHE LISTENS A MOMENT . ) Ah ! The mail truck . Finally . Or maybe Peyto  --  ( SHE STANDS , STRETCHES HER BACK . ) Maybe I 'll get more orders for my pottery . Maybe the Sante Fe News with a review of my work . You know I like to get the mail as soon as it comes . SEGWOHI Maybe they would like to come and review my work  --  ( HE NODS TOWARD THE HOUSE TO INDICATE HIS DRAWINGS IN THE KITCHEN . ) SEREH I 'll show it to the women next time they come for my pots . ( PEYTO ENTERS WITH A FEW LETTERS , SOME PAPERS , AND A DEAD HEN . ) My hen ! Peyto ! Where did you find her ? PEYTO In the ditch by the mailbox . SEGWOHI You 're limping . PEYTO My back is sore from moving my first wife . SEREH I must not have closed the hen in the coop last night . PEYTO You ca n't always get them all  --  SEGWOHI ( HE GOES TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON THE HEN 'S BREAST . ) Buckshot ! Are there more holes in the box ? p. 51 PEYTO I do n't know , Segwohi . There 're so many already it 's hard to tell . SEGWOHI Blast them ! Now the pirates are killing my hens . Well , pluck her feathers . We 'll have chicken for supper . SEREH I do n't know how long she 's been dead . SEGWOHI ( SEGWOHI SHAKES HIS FIST TOWARD THE ROAD . ) Hen killers ! ( HE LEAVES . SEREH WATCHES HIM . ) SEREH I 'll bury her when he 's not looking . ( SEREH LOOKS THROUGH THE FEW LETTERS PEYTO HAS BROUGHT . SHE DOES N'T FIND ANY OF INTEREST AND STUFFS THEM INTO HER APRON POCKET . ) SEGWOHI HEN KILLERS ! ( SEREH AND PEYTO CAN HEAR HIM FROM THE ROAD . ) AAAAAHHHHHH ! ( BUT PEYTO LOOKS TOWARD THE HILL . ) PEYTO  --  The sound of geese crossing the sky . ( PEYTO GOES TO THE DOOR OF THE SHED . SEREH WATCHES HIM . ) For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HIS HEAD . ) SEREH It 's Segwohi out there cackling  --  p. 52 PEYTO No  --  I thought I heard the voice of the Ancestors he always talks about . ( HE PUTS HIS HANDS TO HIS EARS AND TAKES THEM AWAY SEVERAL TIMES . ) So there it is , Sereh  --  the sound of ancient chants . Jazz sounds ! Yawa'dada ' - ski:su . All of a sudden I think I hear ! After all these years of anger at Segwohi . SEREH Look at this bowl I 'm trying to glue together , Peyto . PEYTO How can you work with clay ? It 's cold and damp as death . SEREH It 's the stuff we 're made of , Peyto  --  I breathe life into it .  --  you should know that from your jazz . We create form and life and order out of instruments . Mine is clay and water and a whirling wheel . Yours is metal . PEYTO You do n't think I misuse my art ? SEREH No , Peyto . No more than the clouds that swirl over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO WORK WITH THE PIECES . ) The energy and vitality of your work make it clean , Peyto . PEYTO I brought you drawings the children did for their beloved Aunt Sereh . SEREH Oh , Peyto . ( SHE WIPES HER HANDS AND LOOKS AT THE DRAWINGS . ) I 'll put them on the wall of my shed  --  here next to Segwohi 's drawings he used to do . p. 53 PEYTO ( HE LOOKS TOWARD THE HILL AGAIN . ) I know I hear chanting  --  SEREH ( A SHOUT COMES FROM THE HOUSE . ) Sounds like Segwohi to me  --  ( THEY LEAVE THE SHED AND GO TO THE HOUSE . ) SEGWOHI ( SEGWOHI IS DRAWING AGAIN. )  --  Revenge on the pirates . A mailbox that explodes when they shoot buckshot into it  --  wiping them out ! ( SEGWOHI DRAWS AN EXPLOSION . ) SEREH Remember , Segwohi . We live to become human . SEGWOHI Now I have my drawings  --  they wait for me after I milk the cow . I see why you and Peyto work at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talked with my grandfather when I was a boy . I understood things . ( SEGWOHI HEARS THE SOUND OF JAZZ . HE DRAWS A WHILE LONGER . ) SEREH I will make Segwohi in his medicine-dance . ( SHE DRAWS ALSO . ) I will cut him with the scissors of jazz . Wake up , Segwohi . Another world has come . It 's not ours , but we must live in it . We were an Indian people . Little children of the Great Spirit . Now we 're a shadow of our dreams . But in dreams we dance . We fly like airships. p. 54 SEGWOHI Now I see Peyto 's struggles with these lightning-bolts . I see that I 've been blind to Peyto . I see that I am human . ( HE FINDS THE PLACE IN THE MURAL WHERE HE DREW THE SAXOPHONE . ) I have a feeling there 's room for us all under the wide sky . All the struggling , warring , maybe even destroying a part of ourselves  --  but out of our mistakes  --  ah  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot holes in our own mailboxes . Here is Peyto  --  shot with holes just like the mailbox . Riddled with stars so the sound of his jazz can blow through . The whole sky shot with holes  --  PZZZZZZZ ! ( SEGWOHI LOSES HIMSELF IN HIS DRAWING. )  --  like Sereh 's white northern beans ! PEYTO All right , old man , I 'm going to work on your mural too . We look our separate directions , but we might be the same . Where 's the grease pencil and the LADDER ? I 'm going to make some BEAR TRACKS ! !
