Like the other networks , ABC has been gradually cutting back on documentaries , but the ones it does produce are likely to be blockbusters . These have included entire evenings of prime time devoted to such subjects as education and atomic power . This Wednesday , ABC News presents a masterly three-hour chronicle of America 's role in the world during the past 40 years , focusing on the cold war and U.S.-Soviet relations . Eight months in the making , 45/85 is a judiciously edited video parade filled with rare film footage , some of it broadcast for the first time . It also includes on-camera recollections of some 75 " witnesses , " ranging from Stalin 's interpreter to Ronald Reagan and his three White House predecessors . <P> The program , with Peter Jennings and Ted Koppel as hosts , shows how Washington 's overriding policy goal of containing Communism has affected a wide array of decisions , including the Marshall Plan and the 1977 decision to hand over the Canal Zone to Panama ( an example to Third World nations that the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . By advertising in local newspapers , ABC was able to find color footage of Churchill 's 1946 visit to Fulton , Mo. , where he delivered his famed Iron Curtain speech , and of General Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo . <P> Salted throughout the narrative are the reminiscences of decision makers and ordinary people suddenly caught up in history .

The U.S. , thinking the plane had been destroyed and the pilot killed , initially insisted that the aircraft had been on a weather reconnaissance mission . " After they . . . got thoroughly wound up in this unbelievable story , we decided to tell the world what had really happened , " says Khrushchev . Eisenhower , who had recorded his recollections in 1967 , is heard explaining his side . " When I saw what a terrible mess this lie had made . . . I just said , well , now , look , here 's the truth . . . When you get your fingers caught in the cookie jar , there 's no use in pretending that you were out in the stables somewhere .
