The average gained 8. 71 to 2158. 96 , just above its post-crash closing high of 2158. 61 , set July 5 . The advance came on the heels of Friday ' s 42. 50-point rise in the index of 30 industrial stocks , which was triggered by some favorable news on September unemployment .

While yesterday ' s session proved inconclusive , technical analysts have begun to focus on the market ' s levels just prior to the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials last Oct. 19 as a target area for its latest rally . " The market has been given a green light to close the gap " created by the crash , said Harry Laubscher , a market analyst at Tucker , Anthony &; R.L. Day . Mr. Laubscher said he sees the emphasis on blue-chip issues as the prelude to a broader advance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few weeks .

Ryan Jr. noted that the recent rally in bonds and the accompanying drop in interest rates has caused some investors to reduce their cash positions by investing the funds in stocks . " Unquestionably , the action in the bond market in the past couple of weeks has taken some money off the sidelines and put it to work , but it ' s modest amounts of money so far . It surely isn ' t any tidal wave , " he said . Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman , Sachs &; Co. , added that short-term rates are still high enough to restrain any rallies in stocks .
