It was Day 2 of the Republican National Convention , and Luis Carlos Azenha , a correspondent for Brazil 's TV Manchete network , and his crew of two were trolling for stories outside the New Orleans Superdome . They headed for Lafayette Square , where they hoped to get pictures of men kissing each other at a rally protesting the Republicans ' stand on AIDS . The square , however , was deserted except for a sprinkling of mounted police and a handful of journalists with the same idea as the Brazilians . No story there . <P> The team moved on to the Hilton hotel , where the National Education Association was holding a luncheon for Maureen Reagan . Azenha had heard that some of the vice-presidential contenders might be at the lunch , and he was hoping to interview them . But there was no sign of Bob Dole or Jack Kemp in the cavernous hall . Azenha managed to collar the President 's daughter , who provided a few remarks . Later in the day , he interviewed Shirley Temple Black , a delegate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azenha and other foreign journalists who attended last week 's Republican Convention painfully discovered was that finding a story they could break in New Orleans was about as likely as encountering a flood of the drought-stricken Mississippi River . Even when controversy arose over George Bush 's running mate , Senator Dan Quayle , many reporters from abroad had trouble developing fresh leads on the story , lacking as they did the facilities and long-standing contacts of their American colleagues . <P> Yet the foreign journalists made up in enthusiasm and numbers whatever they lacked in resources . A record 1,300 of them , representing more than 300 news organizations in 51 countries , covered both party conventions this year , exposing more television viewers and newspaper readers around the world to the U.S. presidential contest than ever before . Britain and Canada dispatched large contingents from 15 print and broadcasting organizations each , but the Japanese outdid them in New Orleans with six networks and twelve newspapers . " It shows one thing , " said Toshio Mizushima , a correspondent for the Tokyo-based daily Yomiuri Shimbun , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is really going on in this election . " So are the Europeans . The C-SPAN network 's video verite coverage of the podium in Atlanta was beamed by satellite to 22 European countries , prompting hundreds of viewers in those countries to write to the C-SPAN offices in Washington . Interest in President Reagan 's farewell speech was so high in Britain that the BBC broadcast it live from New Orleans in a 3 1/2-hour special beginning at 1:10 a.m. in London . <P> The one big story of the U.S. presidential race is really many stories to foreign journalists , depending on which aspect of the candidates ' views or the parties ' platforms is of greatest concern to their own countries . The Japanese press has concentrated on trade and economic issues , while the South Africans are almost single-mindedly focused on the question of American sanctions . This year 's campaign has received unusually wide coverage in the Philippines because of George Bush 's now famous 1981 toast commending President Ferdinand Marcos for his " adherence to democratic principles and to democratic processes .
