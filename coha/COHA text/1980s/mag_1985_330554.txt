Washington wits say that Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger has never met a weapons system he did not like . Last week even Weinberger 's patience ran out on one high-priced military project . In a tense press conference , the Secretary announced he was scrapping the Army 's fault-ridden Sergeant York antiaircraft gun , making it one of the most important weapons systems to be canceled in production since the Cheyenne attack helicopter was deep-sixed in 1969 . " It is not worth the costs , " Weinberger said of the program , which would have totaled $4.8 billion before completion . <P> The doomed Sergeant York , named after the famed World War I sharpshooter , had become a symbol of the military 's inherent problem with buying a system still in the testing stage . The gun , formally known as DIVAD ( division air defense ) , was designed to protect troops from air attack , but its radar system was unable to locate even hovering helicopters . Although the weapon was mostly a patchwork of proven hardware , the computer that was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auxiliary power unit provided a heat target for attacking infrared missiles . Charges of $84 million by the contractor , Ford Aerospace &; Communications Corp. , have been disputed by the Pentagon , which has already paid $1.8 billion for 65 of the guns . <P> As Washington became increasingly fed up with the DIVAD 's problems , Weinberger last year ordered a $54 million series of battlefield-condition tests . Congress then authorized money to keep the program alive but with a caveat : the funds would be released only if Weinberger certified that the gun " meets or exceeds the performance specifications of its contract . " The tests were monitored by the Pentagon 's new Operational Test and Evaluation Office , mandated by Congress in 1983 to serve as an independent watchdog . The results were abysmal . Said OT &E; Director Jack Krings last week : " As tested , the Sergeant York was not operationally effective in adequately protecting friendly forces during simulated combat . " <P> The DIVAD cancellation will probably mean layoffs for many of the 1,900 workers at the Ford Aerospace plant in Newport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motor Co. to weather the loss of the contract . Meanwhile , the Army must search for a suitable replacement to take on the Sergeant York 's intended air-defense duties . Said Weinberger : " A decision to cancel what is basically an ineffective system does n't eliminate the need . " <P> Another reputation that may have been on the line in the Sergeant York decision was Weinberger 's . " Killing the DIVAD was vital to saving any fig leaf of Weinberger 's viability on the Hill , " said one senior congressional aide . Legislators have been pressuring the Secretary to cut marginal Pentagon programs to help alleviate the federal deficit crisis . Said Congressman Denny Smith of Oregon , a Viet Nam War veteran and a longtime opponent of the Sergeant York : " My congratulations to Secretary Weinberger for a courageous decision . Too bad he waited so long . "
