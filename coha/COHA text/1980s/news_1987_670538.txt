The time was last month . The place was Chattanooga , Tenn . The occasion was a speech before graduating high school seniors on the University of Tennessee campus . As he and Mrs. Reagan had in the past , the President was urging youngsters to " just say no " to drugs. // And the former actor , a former president of the Screen Actors Guild , was going on to assert that the film industry " should be part of the solution , not part of the problem " of drug abuse. // History suggests that the President will be heeded . The weight of opinion gathering against drug use indicates that movies and television - which have already responded to the widespread disaffection with cigarettes by diminishing their presence in scripts and onscreen - will follow suit by banishing drugs. // But history also suggests that such an action may be ill-advised. // History raises an important question : Is it in our best interest to portray drug use not as it is but as we wish it would be ? // Movies and drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug use on screen , drug scandals within the industry and an outright ban on depiction of illegal drugs in the Production Code that effectively governed Hollywood for some 20 years beginning in 1934. // " Illegal drug traffic must never be presented , " the code said . " Because of its evil consequences , the drug traffic should not be presented in any form . The existence of the trade should not be brought to the attention of audiences. " // And so it was that Americans in the 1930 ' s , 40 ' s and 50 ' s grew up largely ignorant of the appeal and consequences of drugs . Censorship was helping to set the stage for acceptance of marijuana , heroin , PCP or angel dust , cocaine and crack. // In view of the surge in opiate and cocaine use in the United States in recent years , it is interesting to note that the last wave of abuse in the country reached its peak in the decade around the turn of the century - just about the time movies arrived . The high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early films , depictions of drug use - favorable and unfavorable - were commonplace . Silent films showed opium dens ; drugs were a source of humor in Douglas Fairbanks ' s " Mystery of the Leaping Fish , " a 1916 movie in which he played a hyperactive detective named Coke Ennyday . In two 1914 films - " Drug Terror " and " Narcotic Spectre " - drug use was attacked. // Controversy intensified during the 1920 ' s amid drug scandals within the Hollywood community . The murder of the director William Desmond Taylor in 1922 and the death of the actor Wallace Reid from morphine poisoning in 1923 focused attention on the problem . By then , the vast majority of Americans condemned drug use . Alcohol consumption had already plummeted as a result of Prohibition , another reflection of the broad public antagonism toward drugs . Despite current misconceptions , the 1920 ' s were not one long alcoholic binge . Prohibition initially pleased most Americans , and the number of deaths from liver cirrhosis declined. // Still , " divorce , seduction and the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fashionable life , " wrote the film historian Arthur Knight in " The Liveliest Art. " // In the 1930 ' s , however , tolerance toward films that depicted drug use had evaporated along with support for other forms of behavior that critics perceived as undermining the family , stimulating violence and encouraging bad habits. // Drug use was still in its long cycle of decline , and as it abated , government policy makers shifted from seeking mandatory school instruction on narcotics to a conviction that the situation was now so much improved that it would be best not even to mention the subject. // But Hollywood still had no strictures against depicting drug use . In 1934 , the Roman Catholic Church moved to correct the situation . American bishops formed the National Legion of Decency to concentrate their power against Hollywood ' s laxity , in an action generally favored by other faiths . The motion picture industry reacted to the threat of a boycott by Catholic laity by establishing the Production Code Administration. // The strength of the administration , with its code outlawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grant a certificate of approval . For many years , Hollywood accepted the fact that no major motion picture released without the administration ' s certificate could succeed commercially . " Reefer Madness , " the 1937 exploitation film on marijuana use , received neither a certificate nor a popular audience . Public memory of opiate and cocaine addiction began to fade . Heroin use - a familiar threat in 1915 - would be a curiosity when it resurfaced in American society in the early 1950 ' s . When cocaine use in American began to spread some 20 years ago , the epidemic of 1900 barely existed in memory. // A dozen years after the production code was adopted , it was modified . Language adopted in 1946 stated : " The illegal drug traffic must not be portrayed in such a way to stimulate curiosity concerning the use of , or traffic in , such drugs ; nor shall scenes be approved which show the use of illegal drugs , or their effects , in detail. " // The alteration was adopted to pave the way for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the heroic agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics . This admiring tale of the fight against foreign production of drugs and the smugglers who brought them into the United States starred Dick Powell . Not only was the film made with the enthusiastic cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics ; the organization ' s head , Harry J. Anslinger , even portrayed himself in it. // Mr. Powell ' s favorable portrayal of an agent may be contrasted with with the " narcs " who were depicted as villains or buffoons when drug use was rising during the late 1960 ' s and early 70 ' s . During the upward phase of a drug cycle , agents tend to be portrayed as bluenoses with guns or as criminals as corrupt as their prey . During the downward trend , they are admired as protectors of the health and morality of the nation , as in last year ' s three-hour television movie " Courage , " starring Sophia Loren as a New Yorker whose outrage at the drug problem in her family and neighborhood prompts her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1950 ' s the power of the Production Code began to erode . In 1953 , Otto Preminger ' s romantic comedy " The Moon Is Blue , " adapted from F. Hugh Herbert ' s stage success and using the words " pregnant " and " virgin , " was denied a certificate but became a box-office hit . In 1955 , Mr. Preminger defied the Production Code again - this time with " The Man With the Golden Arm , " starring Frank Sinatra as a drug addict. // At the same time , antitrust laws that divested the major studios of ownership of theaters crippled their power to bar unapproved films from their movie houses ; and First Amendment rights had been broadened to include motion pictures . The power of the Production Code to ban narcotics from the screen had been broken. // The system that replaced it in 1968 - the Motion Picture Association of America ratings system - no longer approved or disapproved a film . Rather , it simply rated a film based on content , using one of the now-familiar letters : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period when drug use in the United States was taken as evidence of membership in the avant-garde , of being , as the saying went , " with it. " // In such a climate , American moviegoers saw the drug culture advance from the alienated characters of " Easy Rider " ( 1969 ) to the mainstream Americans of " Private Benjamin " ( 1980 ) and " Poltergeist " ( 1982 ) . // Although it may seem both paradoxical and arguable , the 60 ' s were also a time when marijuana smokers themselves were laying the groundwork for the present wave of opposition to drugs . It was the marijuana smokers and their lobby who responded to an older generation ' s fear of cannabis by pointing out the dangers of alcohol - a substance most people had yet to recognize as a drug . This was the first aggressive challenge to alcohol use by young trendsetters since before World War I. And it continued through the 1970 ' s , with youth condemning what they saw as the hypocrisy of accepting alcohol use while penalizing marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the focus of discussion of the drug problem has been tobacco , heroin , angel dust , cocaine and crack . But attitudes in American society are changing ; and Hollywood is part of American society . Like the rest of society , it has grown doubtful of the hopes and claims for drugs . The resurgence of drug abuse everywhere has made the accumulation of personal tragedies inevitable . Richard Pryor , for example , nearly burned himself to death while freebasing cocaine . Since his recovery and subsequent detoxification , he has taken an earnest stance against drugs , and conversions like his represent a transitional stage from drug acceptance to abstinence as the national norm. // A poll this year in The New York Times found that the number of college freshmen favoring the legalization of marijuana had decreased in the last 10 years from 48. 9 percent to 21. 3 percent . Among the general public , according to a report last year in Newsweek , those favoring criminal penalties for personal possession of small amounts of marijuana increased from 43 percent in 1980 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades , and should these trends continue , we will see the nadir of drug use , including alcohol , perhaps in another decade. // Last year , Richard Frank , president of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences , observed : " You don ' t see cigarettes on television any more . Not because anybody passed a law . Writers wrote cigarettes out , directors don ' t use them as props and actors don ' t have them as a crutch. " // His comments describe what happened to narcotics during the last anti-drug era in the United States . And while the past is no guarantee of the future , it is a useful guide. // So as Hollywood turns against drugs , it is not a matter of the world outside forcing movies to portray drugs differently ; it is a reciprocal relationship . Within the film and television industries , groups concerned about drug abuse have formed - among them the Entertainment Industries Council ( E.I.C. ) and the Creative Coalition Against Drug Abuse . And it is not unreasonable to assume that anti-drug films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.I.C. proposed that the M.P.A.A. expand its rating system to include SA , to be applied to movies showing drug use without negative consequences . Others have recommended an uncompromising X rating for such films . At the same time , appearing at Senate hearings on the problem , Jack Valenti , the president of the M.P.A.A. , said , " The rating system is girding itself for sterner treatment of films in whose content is depicted the use of drugs. " // In April 1986 , the M.P.A.A. and the National Association of Theater Owners , the co-sponsor of its ratings system , announced that any depiction of drug use would receive an automatic PG-13 rating , intended to warn parents that " some material may be inappropriate for young children. " // The evidence is clear that antagonism to depictions of drug use in the absence of bad consequences is growing . The impulse is laudable , and the hope is that drugs will be banished from America . But history suggests that effective censorship is not the way to protect society from a climate of ignorance favorable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . History suggests that ignorance is not bliss . It is only the illusion of bliss. //
