Visitors to Warner , N.H. , often stop by Hillside Books , an antique bookstore , to sit by the fire and chat with Owner Thomas Stotler . A day or two after Christmas , a mild-mannered traveler dropped in . He said he was from New York but wanted to get away from the city for the holidays . Soon the conversation turned to crime in the city . The man told Stotler he had been mugged five times and talked at length about how little protection New Yorkers had from criminals . The book dealer asked his guest if he had heard about the fugitive " vigilante " who had shot four youths he felt were threatening him on a New York subway . " How did you hear about it ? " the visitor asked . " He was interested in it , " said Stotler , " but he did n't try to pin me down for details . " After a while , the New Yorker left without purchasing a book . " I thought he was a nice guy , " Stotler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still do . " <P> A few days after visiting the bookstore , Bernhard Hugo Goetz , 37 , ended his nine-day flight from justice . Since pulling out a silver revolver on a subway and pumping bullets into four teen-agers who asked him if he had $5  --  leaving one of them partly paralyzed  --  Goetz had driven to New Hampshire in a rented car , returned to New York for one day , then taken off again in yet another rented car . On a crisp , bright afternoon in peaceful Concord , N.H. , Goetz grew tired of fleeing . The pale , gaunt electronics engineer walked into local police headquarters and calmly told an officer , " I am the person they are seeking in New York . " <P> Goetz was a legend before the public even knew his name . He was dubbed the Subway Shooter , the Death Wish Vigilante . Like a scene from a Charles Bronson movie suddenly splashed into tabloid surreality , his violent act unleashed a torrent of conflicting emotions among those who cast him as either an urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the young men had actually attacked Goetz , all had criminal records and three were carrying concealed sharpened screwdrivers that could have been used as weapons . A police hot line set up to collect clues to the fugitive gunman 's identity and whereabouts was deluged instead with calls from admirers . <P> The son of immigrants from Germany , Goetz was born in New York City but spent most of his childhood in small towns upstate . A divorcee with no children , Goetz began operating his own company , Electrical Calibrations Laboratories , out of a sparsely furnished apartment on the fringe of Greenwich Village in 1976 . Neighbors describe him as a quiet , humorless man whose efforts to rid the community of derelicts , muggers and drug dealers were marred by occasional racist outbursts.
