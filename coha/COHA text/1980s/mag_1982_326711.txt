A triumphant Columbia returns with two faulty suits and a flat <P> As it came to rest on Runway 22 at California 's Edwards Air Force Base last week , the space shuttle Columbia looked a little travel-weary . In the orange glow of the early-morning desert sun , the ship 's protective tiles showed pits and bruises . Dark streaks lined the fuselage , and a tire was flat , apparently worn down by the friction of a wheel that locked on landing . Casting a baleful eye on the craft that has logged 10.8 million miles on five voyages , Air Force Lieut . General James Abrahamson , director of NASA 'S shuttle program , commented , " It 's beginning to look more like a used spaceship all the time . " But his words were more of a compliment than a criticism . By successfully completing its first operational flight , Columbia showed convincingly that the often maligned $10 billion shuttle program finally was in business . <P> Business in a real sense . Astronaut Vance Brand , 51 , had barely brought down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the runway , " as pilots say-when other NASA hands began thinking of collecting the fees for Columbia 's services . During the five-day mission , the shuttle had carried aloft two commercial communications satellites , one of them American , the other Canadian . NASA will earn more than $18 million for this orbital freight hauling , hardly enough to cover Columbia ' s fuel bill , but a first small step in turning the shuttle into a self-supporting enterprise . <P> For a while last week , one of NASA 's new customers , Telesat Canada , had some anxious moments . Both satellites were safely ejected and climbed swiftly to geostationary orbit , 22,300 miles above the equator , where they would travel in synch with the earth 's rotation . But before Telesat 's Anik 3-C reached its resting place over the Pacific , controllers discovered that they were unable to " talk " to the satellite on any of the programmed frequencies . The radio silence perplexed and panicked Telesat 's control room on Guam . Unless Anik ( Inuit for brother ) accepted their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun or keep it locked in place . Thus its critical maneuvering propellants would quickly freeze . Without this fuel , the $24 million bird would be a dead duck . <P> The controllers desperately began sending random messages on every possible frequency . Finally , only minutes away from a fatal fuel freeze , Anik answered and accepted the lifesaving instructions . What had gone wrong ? A computer programmer had apparently goofed , reversing the number of the correct communications frequency . <P> <P> Not all of last week 's orbital glitches ended so happily . For the first time since 1974 , U.S. astronauts were scheduled for a space walk outside their cabin . But the EVA ( NASAese for extravehicular activity ) had to be postponed when Astronaut Bill Lenoir , 43 , one of the space agency 's new breed of scientifically trained mission specialists , came down with a bad case of space sickness , a puzzling ailment that afflicts about half of all travelers in zero-g . Lenoir may have contributed to his own queasiness by indulging a passion for spicy-hot jalapeo peppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
