American admirers of Kingsley Amis , 64 , were cheered last October to learn that The Old Devils , his 18th novel , had won the Booker Prize , Britain 's most prestigious literary award . " About time " seemed a fitting response to the news , especially from those readers who had discovered the writer 's incendiary comic skills as far back as his first novel , Lucky Jim ( 1954 ) . On the other hand , the thought of Amis ' being toasted across Britain was enough to provoke an unsettling question among Stateside fans : Could it be possible that the aging bad boy wrote a book that did not insult or offend anyone ? <P> The new novel , it turns out , manifests little of the female bashing that made the satiric Stanley and the Women ( 1985 ) so scandalous . In fact , dissatisfied wives are given some tart remarks to make about their variously unsatisfactory husbands . And if Amis continues to put liberal ideas through scorching ridicule , he also allows one of his men an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . Even so , these concessions never denature Amis ' characteristic bite ; instead they suggest a new pathos behind the comic facade . <P> % The people in the title are all in their 60s and living in south Wales . The most prominent among them are Malcolm and Gwen Cellan-Davies , Charlie and Sophie Norris , and Peter and Muriel Thomas , each couple a tottering example of long-term marital pathology . Peter and Muriel have not touched each other in ten years ; Charlie is a night-after-night drunk ; Gwen is restive in the presence of her ineffectual husband . These people find their routines interrupted by the return of Alun and Rhiannon Weaver , friends from their youth who have decided to move back home . Alun has made a name for himself in England as a televised authority on the land of his birth ( " I peddle Wales to the Saxons " ) . For her part , Rhiannon comes back to find two old flames still stirred by the remnants of her youthful beauty . <P> The Weavers galvanize everyone around them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mates gather each midday at the Bible and Crown , the local pub . From there , it is on to expeditions in search of other watering houses that have not been rendered horrible by modern redecoration . At one such ruined spot , Peter pays ironic tribute to the affluent society : " In the bad old days only very rich people could hope to enjoy surroundings like these . Now they 're within the reach of all . " While the men pub-crawl , the wives gossip , drink wine and discuss the problems of having idle men about the premises : " It 's quite a problem for retired people . . . All of a sudden the evening starts starting after breakfast . " <P> With the exception of death , nothing seems likely to interrupt the boozy monotony of such played-out lives . Amis does , as it happens , kill off one of his major characters , with no warning at all . But this end is not a climax . The novel 's conclusion echoes with small regenerations , salvages hoarded against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no less welcome for that . The Old Devils is not quite Amis ' funniest book ; it is his wisest and most humane .
